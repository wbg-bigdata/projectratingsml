APPRAISAL OF THE SALTO OSORIO HYDROELECTRIC PLANT AND
TRANSMISSION LINES OF CENTRAIS ELETRICAS DO SUL DO BRASIL S. A.
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.       This report covers the appraisal of a project of Centrais Eletricas
do Sul do Brasil S.A. (Eletrosul) consisting of the construction of the
700 Mw Salto Osorio hydroelectric plant and associated transmission lines.
Salto Osorio is one of the priority projects emerging from a power study
of South Brazil (the Canambra Report) made between 1966 and 1969 under a
United Nations Development Program (UNDP) grant for which the Bank was
Executing Agency. A Bank loan of US$70 million equivalent is proposed,
comprising US$60 million to finance the cost of equipment and services,
and US$10 million for interest during construction. The project is estimated
to cost US$152 million equivalent and is the major element in the construction
program of Eletrosul, representing 60% of the program's total estimated cost
of US$255 million during the six-year construction period 1971-76.
ii.      Total Bank lending for the electric power sector in Brazil has been
US$622 million, mostly in the south central region where with the support and
cooperation of the Government and those responsible for sector affairs it
has been an important factor in ensuring the most economic development of
power facilities. Moreover, it has helped to ensure the development of the
sector on a rational institutional basis.
iii.     Eletrosul is a newly formed (1968) autonomous electric utility,
owned principally by the Federal Government, and will become the largest
and most important generation and transmission company in the southern region.
With the assistance of consulting engineers it should be able to implement the
project satisfactorily. Eletrosul promises to be a well-managed company.
Its principal officers, who have had long experience in the public utility
field, have employed consulting firms to assist in setting up the organiza-
tion and to advise on coordinating operations with other utilities in the
region.
iv.      Because Eletrosul is a new company the local costs of the expansion
program will be financed principally by its parent company, Centrais Eletricas
Brasileiras S.A. (Eletrobras), the federally owned entity responsible for
the development and financing of federally sponsored power projects. With
the acquisition of several thermal electric power subsidiaries of Eletrobras
and the completion of a hydroelectric plant now under construction, Eletrosul
is expected by 1973 to earn the return of 10% provided for by regulation.



- ii -
v.       The estimated cost of the project, the proposed construction
schedule, and the proposed financial plan are reasonable. The facilities
to be provided are required to enable Eletrosul to meet its share of the
expected demand for power in south Brazil.
vi.      Brazilian industry would compete for equipment orders as under
previous loans, and is expected to win a considerable number of contracts
which would be eligible for Bank financing, which would cover the total
cost of the equipment whether of local or foreign origin. For the purpose
of evaluating bids, local manufacturers would have a 15% margin of preference.
vii.     The project is the least cost alternative for meeting the load growth
requirements of Eletrosul. The internal financial rate of return for the
Salto Osorio project is 15%, which is satisfactory.
viii.    The project is a suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$70 million
equivalent for 25 years, including a grace period of six years.

APPRZASAL OF THE SALTO OSORIO HYDROELECTRIC PLANT
AND TRANSMISSION LINES OF CENTRAIS ELETRICAS DO SUL DO BRASIL S. A.
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01     Centrais Eletricas do Sul do Brasil S.A. (Eletrosul), a recently
created (1968) corporation, almost wholly owned by the Federal Government,
has requested a Bank loan of US$70 million equivalent, comprising US$60 mil-
lion for electrical and mechanical equipment and the foreign component of
engineering and training costs and US$10 million for interest during con-
struction, for a project with a total estimated cost of US$152.3 million
equivalent. The project would consist of construction of the 700 Mw Salto
Osorio hydroelectric plant on the Iguacu River in the State of Parana and
1,562 km of 230 kv transmission lines interconnecting points in the three
southernmost states of Brazil -- Parana, Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do
Sul -- which over the next five years will require an investment of
US$450 million equivalent, or 12% of the national sector requirement.
1.02     The Salto Osorio project was recommended for construction in a
power study of south Brazil carried out by a consortium of Canadian and
American consulting firms (Canambra) in 1966-69 under the sponsorship of
the UNDP. The Bank acting as Executing Agency approved the recommendations
in the report which devised a long-term plan for the development of genera-
tion and transmission facilities in south Brazil during the 'seventies,'
based on the Canambra estimate of load growth in the period. The Federal
Government, through Eletrobras, the entity responsible for development and
financing of Federal power proJects, organized Eletrosul for the purpose
of carrying out those projects in the program which will be owned by the
Federal Government, and to perform a function in south Brazil similar to
that performed in south central Brazil by Central Eletrica de Furnas S.A.
(Furnas), which received five Bank loans totalling US$271.3 million since
1958. It is intended that Eletrosul, like Furnas, will in its territory
become the predominant generation and transmission entity, constructing
facilities with the aid of Federal funds and selling wholesale to State,
municipal and private power entities.
1.03     This report is based on the findings of a Bank mission comprised
of Messrs. R.L. Bloor, P.J. Cornford and M.J. Reis, who visited Brazil in
August/September 1970.
II. THE POWER SECTOR
1/
Economic Background-=
2.01     Brazil experienced a growth in gross domestic product of 9.0% in
1969 in real terms, compared with 7.4% over the 1967-9 period, and 5.7%
over the years 1960-70. Continued growth of 6-7% is foreseen. Industrial
l/ The most recent information on the state of Brazil's economy is given
in Report No. WH-203, dated November 4, 1970.

output increased 10.8% in 1969. South Brazil contains 19% of the nation's
population and accounts for 18% of GNP. It contributes 41% of the national
agricultural production, with coffee the principal crop, and 9% of the nation's
industrial production. The gross domestic product of the region is likely
to grow at a somewhat higher rate than the national average.
The Power Sector-/
2.02     The bulk of electric power in Brazil is produced by government
entities, although there is substantial private production. In 1969 the total
installed capacity of 10,400 Mw was about 34% under Federal control, 33% under
State control and the remainder in private hands. Total production in 1969
was 41,648 Gwh, 84% of which was produced by six Federal and State-owned com-
panies and the Canadian-owned utilities operating in the cities of Rio de
Janeiro and Sao Paulo. Production in 1969 in the different sections of the
country was:
Northeast          8%
North and
West Central    2%
South Central    80%
South             10%
2/
National usage of electric power was about 460 kwh per capita-; in the south
central region it was about 840 kwh per capita because of the substantial
industrialization, and in the southern region about 260 kwh per capita, reflect-
ing the predominantly agricultural economy. This compares with about 2,000 kwh
per capita in Italy and 750 kwh in the Argentine.
2.03     The total amount of Bank lending for the electric power sector in
Brazil has been US$622 million, mostly in the south central region. The Bank
lending, with the support and cooperation of Brazilian authorities, has been
important in helping to secure the most economic development of power facilities
in the south central region and the development of the sector on a sound
institutional basis; examples are,
The revaluation of assets on a systematic basis to ensure
real and adequate rates of return, to offset the effects
of inflation;
The establishment of contracts for the transfer of energy
among the several power entities; and
The technical operation of the system on the most economical
pooling basis.
1/ The power sector in Brazil is described in detail in Report No. WH-173.
2/ A lower figure ahown in Annex 16 is based on earlier data.



- 3 -
In south Brazil the proposed loan will be of considerable importance in
achieving similar results, since this project will mark the first initiative
in a plan for the rational development of power in this region.
2.04      That part of the public power sector under the Federal Government
is administered by Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras S.A. (Eletrobras), a limited
liability company created in 1961 to implement Federal policy in the electric
power sector. Eletrobras, the parent company of Eletrosul, is the majority
stockholder in 15 (Federal) power companies which are subsidiaries of it, and
a minority stockholder in 20 associated companies controlled by State Govern-
ments. It administers public funds in the form of loans or equity investments
to its subsidiaries, providing close to 50% of their capital needs.
2.05      At present small amounts of power from the south central region are
exported to south Brazil but transmission distances are large and basically
the southern region must develop the capability of meeting the power market
in its three states.
2.06      The principal power companies in the region are:
Eletrosul, the proposed borrower and a subsidiary of Eletrobras;
State of Parana
Companhia Paranaense de Energia Eletrica S.A. (COPEL) - The State-
owned electricity utility of Parana which generates and distri-
butes power throughout the State;
Companhia Forca e Luz do Parana (CFLP) - An electric utility
subsidiary of Eletrobras serving the city of Curitiba, the State
capital of Parana.
State of Santa Catarina
Centrais Eletricas de Santa Catarina S.A. (CELESC) - The State-
owned electric utility of Santa Catarina which generates and
distributes power throughout the State;
SociedadeTermoeletrica de Capivari S.A. (SOTELCA) - A thermal
electric generating company located in Santa Catarina and a
subsidiary of Eletrobras;
State of Rio Grande do Sul
Companhia Estadual de Energia Eletrica (CEEE) - The State-owned
electric utility of Rio Grande do Sul which generates and dis-
tributes power throughout the State.



-4-
Eletrosul
2.07    Eletrosul (para. 1.01), the newest subsidiary of Eletrobras,
is a bulk power producer and will sell to other utilities only at wholesale.
Its properties comprise the 220 Mw Passo Fundo hydroelectric plant, the
construction of which will be completed in 1973, and the recently acquired
Eletrobras subsidiary Termoeletrica de Charqueadas S.A. (Charqueadas), the
main operating facility of which is a 72 Mw thermal plant. Both these facili-
ties are located in Rio Grande do Sul, as is the 66 Mw thermal plant of
Termoeletrica de Alegrete S.A. (Alegrete), an Eletrobras subsidiary, which
Eletrobras is to transfer to Eletrosul in 1971. Eletrosul is also to acquire
in 1971 another Eletrobras subsidiary, SOTELCA, in Santa Catarina, with a
100 Mw thermal generating plant now in operation, and with an additional 132 Mw
under construction. By 1975, before Salto Osorio is in operation, Eletrosul
will be the largest producer of power in south Brazil with an installed capac-
ity of about 600 Mw, some 30% of the regional peak requirement. Eletrosul's
installed generating capacities and transmission facilities over the years,
1971-76, are shown in Annex 1. Construction expenditures during this period,
including an unidentified project which it is assumed Eletrosul will be start-
ing in 1974, are estimated at US$255 million equivalent.
Facilities in South Brazil
2.08    Major generating plants in Parana and Santa Catarina are inter-
connected, and there are interconnections between these States. An inter-
connection with Rio Grande do Sul, where the predominating frequency is
50 cycles&/ in contrast with the 60 cycle frequency found in other states
in Brazil was completed recently. Conversion to 60 cycles has begun and
will be completed in 1973.
2.09    In 1969, the installed capacity in south Brazil and the part inter-
connected within each state were as follows:
1/ The origin of the use of 50 cycles in Rio Grande do Sul is attributed
to its proximity and limited interconnections with neighboring Uruguay where
the 50 cycle frequency is standard.

The existing and future facilities of the principal power companies in
the region are shown in detail in Annex 2. All of the companies have their
own generating facilities, but most of those selling directly to consumers
have insufficient generating capacity and must purchase power wholesale from
other companies. It is expected that by 1973 power will be bought and sold
by all companies on a regional pooling basis. In this connection Eletrosul
is taking the initiative in establishing cooperative arrangements with other
companies.
Expansion of Distribution Facilities
2.10      To assist in the provision of adequate distribution facilities,
the three State companies, (COPEL, CELESC and CEEE, para. 2.06) received loans
from the US Agency for International Development (AID) and Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB), and CFLP (supplying the city of Curitiba) received
a Bank loan of US$8.1 million equivalent (476 BR). The companies are expected
to be able to continue to maintain adequate distribution facilities in the
future.

III. THE BORROWER
3.01      The share capital of Eletrosul on December 31, 1969 was
Cr$ll1  million, of which Eletrobras held nearly 84%.  Its principal other
shareholders are the State of Rio Grande do Sul, Companhia Estadual de
Energia Eletrica (CEEE), National Coal Planning Commission, Usinas Siderurgia
de Minas Gerais S.A., and Centrais Eletricas de Santa Catarina S.A. (CELESC).
3.02      The shareholders meet at least once a year to review the progress,
planning and financial position of the company. Besides electing the Board of
Directors initially, they also appoint a council to review the company's
financial position. The Board consists of the President and four Directors
(Planning, Finance and Administration, Engineering, Field Operations). The
members are appointed for four years and can be reappointed.
3.03      Eletrosul was created and commenced operations in 1968.  In 1970
it had 180 employees. By 1975 it expects to have about 1,500, reflecting
the acquisition of companies and construction of new facilities. This is
reasonable.
3.04      Eletrosul gives promise of being a company with high-quality manage-
ment. The Board members have had long experience in the field of public
utilities, mostly within Eletrobras subsidiaries. These officials have employed
management and accounting advisory consulting firms to help set up the organi-
zation and standardize procedures. Moreover, the proposed loan includes
US$1 million for employment of consultants to conduct training programs and
for further education of Eletrosul personnel outside Brazil. As noted in
para. 4.10 the company, with the help of engineering consultants, should
experience no difficulty in carrying out the project.



IV. THE PROJECT
4.01      The project consists of (1) the 700 Mw Salto Osorio hydro-
electric plant to be constructed on the Iguacu River; (2) a 230 kv, 1,562 km
transmission system, and (3) provision of engineering, training and managerial
services. The proposed loan would cover the costs of the equipment and
services, plus the interest on the loan during construction.
4.02      Salto Osorio will be a run-of-river plant with a net head of 70 m.
It will be situated at a natural falls about 170 km upstream of the Iguacu's
confluence with the Parana River, 385 km west of Curitiba in the State of
Parana. The average flow of the Iguacu River is 900 m3/ sec, but it experi-
ences large variations in flow. Estimated annual energy production of Salto
Osorio is 1.9 billion kwh, with a plant factor of 32%.  The plant will be used
to a considerable extent as a peaking plant employing the water stored in the
pond created by its dam for this purpose. Thus, its operation will complement
that of the existing hydro plants with their large storage volumes and the
thermal plants with their base load characteristics. The construction of up-
stream generating plants and storage facilities is foreseen in the Canambra
Report (para. 1.02) by 1981. Salto Osorio would become a fully regulated plant
at such time.
4.03      The hydro plant's main features are:
i) a rockfill dam 750 m long, maximum height 56 m and
volume of 4 million m3;
ii) two concrete gated spillway structures with widths of
75 and 60 m;
iii)  a concrete gravity dam 55 m long and 55 m high connecting
one spillway with the rockfill dam;
iv) a powerhouse with a concrete intake structure and short
steel penstocks providing space for six 175 Mw units, of
which four would be installed under the project;
v)  a switchyard adjacent to the powerhouse.
4.04      Except in the arrangements for river diversion and cofferdams,
the plant's construction presents no unusual problems. The river is
completely unregulated and can flood in any month, hence, the cost of
diversion tunnels completely adequate to handle floods would be excessive.
A two-stage diversion scheme has been designed. The first stage, encom-
passing most of the construction, would provide a cofferdam that would
divert a flood having a frequency of once in 100 years, a reasonable and



acceptable risk in Aydroelectric construction. The second stage would contain
mainly embankment construction and rely on diversion openings left in one of
the spillway structures which could handle a flood having a frequency of once
in 39 years. To offset this higher risk, the embankment is designed so as to
minimize damage caused by flood overflow and to reduce the risk to the shortest
possible period, the specifications will call for the embankment facilities to
be built in the minimum time possible.
Transmission
4.05      The existing transmission system in south Brazil is not adequate
to carry the output of the Salto Osorio plant and, therefore, additional
lines will be constructed. In general, the new lines (see map) will run
northward to serve the fast-growing region in the northern part of Parana
and interconnect with the south-central region, eastward to serve Curitiba,
and southward through Santa Catarina and into Rio Grande do Sul to connect
with the Passo Fundo hydroelectric plant now under construction. The latter
connection will result in the interconnection of the three states.

1/ This figure includes some foreign exchange component of civil works, which
has not been estimated separately because these works would not be financed by
the proposed loan.
The cost estimates are based partly on recent construction experience on
similar work in Brazil and partly on the advice of Eletrosul's consultants
and suppliers. The estimates were examined closely and are considered
reasonable. In preparing them, the consultants took into consideration the
price rises of recent years and have included 5-1/2% of the equipment cost
(both local and foreign) in the contingency item for the real increases in
prices that are likely to occur over the next 18 months or so, the period in
which orders will be placed. Physical contingency allowances of 187. for the
hydroelectric plant and of 10% for the transmission system are also included;
these contingencies are adequate considering the advanced state of site investi-
gations and planning.

Amount of the Proposed Loan
4.07      The loan is intended to cover 100% of the cost of electrical and
mechanical equipment needed for the project. The principal items will be
hydraulic turbines, generators, transformers, gates and valves, penstocks,
transmission towers and cables, switch-gear and control equipment. It will
not cover civil works; -- there are fully qualified contractors in Brazil,
and the job will be awarded to one of them following competitive bidding in
Brazil -- nor such basic materials as cement and reinforcing steel for which
international competition would offer no advantages. Purchasing experience
in power lending to Brazil up to 1970 indicates that Brazilian manufacturers
are likely to obtain about 35% of the contracts for the equipment for the power-
house and dam and about 70% of the contracts for the transmission system.
These percentages were used in estimating the local and foreign currency com-
ponents of equipment costs, under the assumption (based on a previous study)
that 50% of the value of Brazilian contracts will be for imported items includ-
ing components of equipment, materials, and depreciation on imported manufactur-
ing equ7nment.  On this basis, about US$16.3 million, or 23% of the loan amount,
is expected to finance local expenditures on contracts secured by Brazilian
bidders. The composition of the proposed loan is therefore estimated as follows:
Foreign currency component (para. 4.06)    US$43.7 million
Local currency component                     US$16.3 million
Interest during construction                 US$10.0 million
Proposed Bank loan                        US$70.0 million
Unit Cost
4.08      The cost per kw of the Salto Osorio plant, due to favorable natural
conditions, is only US$155, which is low compared with the cost of the average
hydro plant, in the US$250-400 range, and compares favorably with the lowest
cost plant recently built in Brazil.
Engineering and Construction
4.09      Engineering for the Salto Osorio project began with the Canambra
study (para. 1.02), which included an investigation of sites for both hydro
and thermal plants, a market study, and the development of a program of
construction through 1980 to meet the anticipated demand for electricity.
The Iguacu River was recognized as an excellent river for power development.
The Salto Osorio site was found to be well suited to a relatively low-cost
bydro plant with the additional advantage of existing access roads which
in this region could save construction time by a year or more. Canambra
therefore recommended it as a first-priority project. In 1969, Kaiser
Engineers International Corporation (Kaiser) and Serete S.A. Engenharia
(Serete, a Brazilian firm) were engaged to undertake engineering services
for the project. In view of its limited experience Eletrosul in early
1970 delegated to COPEL, which has had extensive experience in construction
and administration of power projects, the coordination and management of
engineering and construction activities for Salto Osorio. A Consulting Board



- 10 -
of three experts in large dam construction and engineering geology has been
employed and has visited the site twice and made recommendations on design
and construction problems. The more recent detailed studies have not materi-
ally changed Canambra's original proposals for the hydroolectric plant and
the transmission system and the engineering for the project is adequate.
4.10      The project is already under construction.  Access roads have been
improved, a construction bridge has been built, a cofferdam has been started
and excavation is under way of the powerhouse site. This vork is under the
supervision of COPEL personnel. These personnel will be adequate for supervis-
ing the construction of the project with the help of Kaiser and other consul-
tants noted above. Eletrosul has given assurances that it will retain engin-
eering consultants satisfactory to the Bank for the design of the project and
to assist in supervising construction.
4.11      The main civil works contractor will move on to the site during the
first half of 1971. During the latter half of 1971 procurement of the electri-
cal and mechanical equipment will commence. Transmission line construction will
start in 1971 and continue into 1976. The first unit of the powerhouse is
scheduled to operate in the first half of 1975 and the fourth and last early in
1976. These schedules are well planned and attainable.
Ecological Impact
4.12      The hydro plant will flood about 60 sq.km. of land, largely undevelop-
ed jungle, and thus there will be very little resettlement of population. Since
the plant will be the run-of-river type, it will have little effect on river
flows. While the dam structures will change the appearance of attractive
natural falls and rapids, the lake created by the dam may eventually become
a recreation area.
V. PROCUREMENT AND DISBURSEMENT
5.01      Procurement of goods and services financed by the Bank loan would
be on the basis of international competitive bidding, with the exception
1) of 6ome minor items totalling up to about US$750,000, for which such bidding
would be impractical; and 2) professional services needed for engineering and
training. As in the Bank's previous power loans in Brazil, local manufacturers
would be eligible to compete in the bidding with the advantage of a 15% margin
of preference.



- 11 -
5.02      No disbursements would be made for expenditures incurred prior to
the signing of the loan, except for the foreign exchange cost of engineer-
ing services, amounting to about US$550,000. Disbursements under the proposed
loan would cover the CIF cost of equipment from foreign origin
and the FOB cost from local suppliers. For engineering services and training
costs, disbursements would be for the actual foreign exchange cost. The estim-
ated schedule of disbursements from the proposed Bank loan is shown in Annex 3.
Any amounts remaining unutilized would be cancelled.
VI. JUSTIFICATION OF THE PROJECT
6.01      The average annual growth of electric energy consumption in south
Brazil was 10.5% for the period 1952-69, a high of 12.7% being achieved between
1959 and 1964, and a low of 5.1% during the 1964-66 recession. It is estimated
that electricity growth will continue at about the same rate through the
'seventies.'
6.02      The forecast to 1980 was made by Canambra, using the projections
forecast by Federal Government agencies concerning the number of customers
and kwh consumption per customer. Projections of industrial consumption were
based on trends adjusted for new industries known to be definitely planned.
Losses and load factors were estimated to determine generation and peak capac-
ity requirements. Kaiser and Serete reviewed Canambra's forecast in 1970 and
found no basis for making any change to it.
6.03      The Canambra study estimated growth in regional demand during 1966-80
of 10.8% annually. This is consistent with the long-term trend. Moreover,
it reflects the general outlook for the economy of the region which the Bank's
1970 economic mission considers should develop at about the same rate, or even
somewhat higher, than in the past. Given that the principal activity, agri-
culture, is expanding at a stable rate while the growth of industrial activity
fluctuates, the forecast of load growth is reasonable.
6.04      Reserve capacity requirements needed to establish an adequate
program of generation were based on normally accepted criteria, which is
the greater of:
1) combined capacity of the largest hydro and thermal
units in the system, or
2)  10% of the annual system peak load.
This level of reserve would provide sufficient generating capacity to supply
the demand during periods when units are shut down for maintenance or emergency
repairs. On this basis a power balance for the years 1970-80 was prepared
(Annex 4), which is considered appropriate for planning power generation and



- 12 -
transmission. Even with a somewhat lower growth rate, south Brazil will
not achieve adequate capacity until Salto Osorio, or the equivalent plant,
is completed.
6.05      Annex 4 shows the relationship between the Canambra program of
expansion of generation through 1980 as related to the projected market.
It shows that there will be shortages in capacity through 1975 which are
expected to be made up by imports from the south central region, as has been
the case in the past. However, imports from the south central region are
unlikely to be available after 1975 and, indeed, if there should be surpluses
in the south, they would be useful for export to the south central region.
The timely completion of the Salto Osorio hydro plant is thus necessary to
ensure an adequate and reliable supply of power for south Brazil after 1975.
Alternative Sources of Energy and Capacity
6.06      The proposed project represents the most economic form in which
additional generating capacity can be provided. The development program
proposed in the Canambra study, which recommended that Salto Osorio should
be the first generating facility constructed, was designed itself as being
the most economic program. The importation of power from the south central
region, involving provision of extensive transmission facilities, as one
alternative, was found to be uneconomic. As an additional check, Kaiser
and Serete made a study of alternative new generation sources, each of
which would equally well enable the south Brazil interconnected system to
deliver the same amount of power to the market. An alternative development
of the system which incorporated the provision of a thermal plant located
on the seaboard and transmission facilities to deliver the output inland to
the market was considered. The minimum discount rate at which the system
investment and operating costs of the alternative program equalized the program
incorporating Salto Osorio was 16.5%; i.e., the progran based upon Salto Osorio
is the least cost alternative for all discount rates up to 16.5%. Salto Osorio
is, therefore, the superior investment.
Internal Financial Rate of Return
6.07      The internal financial rate of return (see Annex 5) of the Salto
Osorio project is approximately 15%, which is satisfactory. Financial
benefits are understated because power rates charged to the distribution
companies which Eletrosul will supply at wholesale do not include taxes
levied on ultimate consumers (Annex 6, para. 6).

VII. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
7.01      The financial prospects of Eletrosul must be considered in the
light that it has little history and will grow rapidly as the result of
construction of new plant and amalgamation with existing utilities (para. 2.07).
Fortunately, it is possible to make reasonable projections since the level
of earnings of electric utilities in Brazil are determined more than in other
countries by the regulatory system. The power sector in Brazil enjoys the
benefits of a well-functioning system of regulation. It provides for a 10%
return on assets in real terms. A key feature is a mechanism which enables
systematic adjustments to be made to offset the effects of inflation. The
Eletrosul system should therefore be able to develop a satisfactory level of
earning power.
Tariffs
7.02      Under Brazilian regulation, set forth in Annex 6, a 107. return is
allowed on remunerable investment comprised of plant in service, revalued
annually, plus various current assets. Surcharges can be placed in effect
automatically to cover increases in operating costs and in foreign debt
service.  Ultimate consumers also pay additional sums (37% to 57%) on electric
bills for taxes and compulsory loans, proceeds of which are used for electric
plant expansion.
7.03      Under existing legislation, annual revaluation of assets (see
Annex 6) to reflect the effects of inflation is mandatory, but related applica-
tions for tariff increases based on such revaluations are not. Coefficients
are issued annually by the Government and used to revalue fixed assets and lcn-
term debt. In this respect, to assure that adequate earnings are maintained
despite inflation, provisions similar to those in other Bank power loans in
Brazil are included in the proposed loan and guarantee agreements, as follows-
(a) Eletrosul shall make applications for tariff adjustments
(in addition to permitted automatic tariff adjustments)
based on annual revaluations within five months after the
end of 1972 and after the end of every calendar year there-
after, so that its tariffs will be sufficient to ensure
realization of the return on remunerable investment permitted
under Brazilian regulation after appropriate depreciation
charges (para. 7.17).
(b) Eletrosul and Eletrobras shall undertake that tariff appli-
cations similar to those in (a) above shall within five
months after the end of 1970 and 1971 be made for the
Charqueadas and SOTELCA properties.



- 14 -
(c) The Government of Brazil shall require agencies with
jurisdiction over rates of Eletrosul and the companies
to be merged with it to act on tariff applications
within a period of not more than 30 days after their
receipt.
(d) The Bank may suspend or cancel the loan in the event
applicable legislation is changed materially and
adversely affects the business of the Eletrosul system.
Past Operations
7.04      Past operations of the three operating companies - Charqueadas,
Alegrete and SOTELCA - (Annex 7) are not a significant guide for the future
of the Eletrosul system because in 1976 new properties now under construction
or to be built will comprise over three-fourths of the gross fixed assets in
operation.
Audit
7.05      The 1969 financial statements of Eletrosul and SOTELCA have been
audited by the certified public accounting firm of Bouchinhas and Campos,
which is associated with international auditors. The game firm reviewed the
accounts of Charqueadas and Alegrete in mid-1970 and recommended some correc-
tions in the cruzeiro valuation of long-term debt owed by Alegrete to a sup-
plier. Provision is made in the proposed loan agreement that Eletrosul will
continue to employ independent auditors satisfactory to the Bank and will
annually submit certified financial statements, accompanied by the auditor's
report, within four months of the close of each fiscal year.
Financial Position
7.06      Combined balance sheets of the Eletrosul systenL/ are shown in
Annex 10. The summary balance sheets presented below reflect the effect of
revaluing accounts as of December 31, 1969 on the basis of the foreign exchange
rates and the coefficient applicable at that date.  Work in progress, compris-
ing about 35% of total fixed assets at the end of 1969 and about 50% at the
end of 1970, represents principally construction of Eletrosul's Passo Fundo
project. During 1970 the heavy debt of Alegrete was reduced through the ex-
change by Eletrobras of Cr$67 million of long-term debt (about one-half the
total outstanding) into share capital.

(b)  Includes Cr$33 million long-term debt due within one year.
7.07      Long-term debt due within one year at the close of 1970 included
Cr$ll.l million of debt of Alegrete, due in January 1971. Eletrobras
purchased additional common shares of Alegrete to meet this maturity.
7.08      Long-term debt at the end of 1969 was heavy, amounting to 647. of
total capitalization and 68% of total fixed assets, as shown in Annex 10.
Estimated percentages at the end of 1970 were 55% and 57%, respectively. The
changed capital structure provides a better foundation for the substantial
expansion of assets contemplated by the Eletrosul system. Annex 13 gives a
detailed schedule of individual long-term debts.



- 16 -
Proposed Financing Plan
7.09      The projected financing of Eletrosul as a whole, including the
Salto Osorio project, is designed to maintain a capital structure comprised
of no more than 60X of long-term debt. This plan is reasonable. Local funds
will be obtained essentially through loans and purchase of share capital by
Eletrobras and retention of earnings. Foreign exchange transactions in all
financing projections have been stated at the December 31, 1969 rate of
Cr$4.35 to US$1. No provision has been made for subsequent changes in foreign
exchange rates, which take place every 30-60 days in small amounts, because
they are provided for under the tariff arrangements. A forecast of the source
and application of funds for the 8-year period 1970 through 1977 is shown in
Annex 9. The plan for financing the expansion program over that period is
summarized in the following table.

7.10      To*al funds required for the forecasted 8-year period are estimated
at Cr$l,720 iiillion, including Cr$l,419 for construction, Cr$246 million
for cash payntent of interest charged to construction and Cr$55 million for
additional ws-rking capital. The proposed Salto Osorio project is estimated
to cost Cr$8Jl million, including payments for interest, or about one-half of
the total construction expenditures over the period. A detailed schedule
of the construction program is in Annex 12.
7.11      Eletrobras over the 8-year period 1970-1977 is expected to increase
its holdings in long-term debt of Eletrosul by close to Cr$350 million and
to invest approximately Cr$300 million in the purchase of additional shares,
apart from retained earnings. Its ownership of shares will increase from 84%
of the total at the end of 1969 to 96% at the end of the period. The financial
projections assume that dividends will not be paid in order to assist in the
financing of the large construction expenditures envisaged. Should, however,
Eletrobras at some point favor dividend payments, the financial safeguards
provided by the proposed loan covenants (para. 7.14) would assure the continued
financial ability of Eletrosul to carry out the project.
7.12      Net internal cash generation over the entire period, amounting to
15% of the total source of funds, includes a negative total of Cr$62 million
over the years 1970-1972 when there is a relatively high amount of work in
progress in relation to net fixed assets in operation. Work in progress is
not part of remunerable investment. From 1973 onward, Eletrosul will benefit
from the operation of new facilities on which a return of 10% allowed by regula-
tion will be earned. Over the years 1973-1977 net internal cash generation is
projected at 30% of the total source of funds.
7.13      For the purpose of this report it has been assumed that the annual
interest rate on the proposed Bank loan would be 7-1/4% and commitment charges
would be at a rate of 0.75% per year. The Bank loan would have a 6-year grace
period and a 19-year amortization period. The Eletrobras loan for the Salto
Osorio project has been included in the financial projections as a 22-year
loan, including a 7-year grace period, with a 13% annual cost during the amor-
tization period and a 14% cost during the grace period. There are no commit-
ment fees but a single loan fee of 2% will be charged. Detailed schedules of
the annual interest and amortization payments for all loans have been included
in Annex 14 (Interest Schedule) and Annex 15 (Amortization Schedule).
7.14      Although Eletrosul as yet has no specific plans for construction of
additional generating facilities, it is expected to participate in the further
power expansion in south Brazil. The financial projections take this into
account and the proposed loan and guarantee agreements include three provisions,
as follows:
(a) During the period of construction of the Salto Osorio
project, no other major projects or acquisitions will be under-
taken except in accordance with a financing plan satisfactory



- 19 -
to th~ Bank. A major project or acquisition will be
deeme to be one with a cost in excess of 1% of gross
fixed assets in operation plus work-in-progress.
(b) As long as the Bank loan is outstanding Eletrosul will
not incur additional debt without prior approval of the
Bank unless its net revenues for the fiscal year preceding
such incurrence, or for a later 12-month period before the
incurrence, shall be more than 1.5 times the maximum debt
service for any succeeding fiscal year on all debt, including
the debt to be incurred. If Eletrosul is required to seek
the Bank's consent because of inability to meet this test,
the Bank will give appropriate consideration to estimated
future earnings in view of the fact that in the period before
the project goes into operation revenues of Eletrosul may not
reflect its potential future earning power.
(c) Eletrobras will purchase sufficient capital shares so that
long-term debt will not exceed 60% of capitalization or of
total fixed assets, whichever is less.
7.15      In addition, the proposed guarantee agreement includes assurances
that in the event of a shortage of funds the Government will provide Eletrosni.
the amount needed to carry out the Bank project.
Estimated Future Operations
7.16      While the forecasts of earnings (Annex 8) for 1973 and subsequent
years are based primarily on the expectation that Eletrosul will be able
to earn the allowable return of 10% (para. 7.02), it is not practicable to
earn a 107. return in 1971 or 1972 because Alegrete will still be in a develop-
ment stage (Annex 7). However, economies of scale will be achieved in 1973
upon completion of Passo Fundo and additional SOTELCA generating facilities.
7.17      Future depreciation charges are projected to average 3.1% of fixed
assets in operation upon completion of all pending projects. However, this
composite rate is comprised of a 3% depreciation rate for the Passo Fundo and
Salto osorio projects and wide variations in the depreciation rates for the
thermal properties of the system now being applied -- about 4-1/2% for
Charqueadas, 3-1/2% for SOTELCA and only 2-1/4% for Alegrete.  The proposed
loan agreement provides that Eletrosul will review and study depreciation
policy so that, prior to the start of operations of Salto Osorio, rates of
depreciation, satisfactory to the Bank, will be charged. Likewise, provision
is made for a similar review with respect to adoption of the amortization
charges permitted by regulation (Annex 6).



- 20 -
7.18      Future coverage of debt service by internal cash generation is
indicated in the forecast source and application of funds statement
(Annex 9). The coverage is 1.7 times in 1976 when Salto Osorio goes into
full operation, and 1.4 times in 1977 when repayment starts on the loans
for construction of the Salto Osorio project. Interest is expected to be
covered 1.9-2.1 times by operating income in those two years (Annex 8).
These ratios are adequate. Coverage ratios in earlier years before realiza-
tion of operating income from Salto Osorio are not significant.
VIII. AGREEMENTS REACHED DURING NEGOTIATIONS
8.01      During loan negotiations, agreement was reached on the following
points:
(a)  Eletrosul will retain engineering consultants satisfactory
to the Bank for the design of the project and to supervise
construction (para. 4.10);
(b)  Tariffs will be adjusted annually to reflect the revaluation
of assets (para. 7.03);
(c)  Financial statements certified by independent auditors satis-
factory to the Bank will be supplied annually (para. 7.05);
(d)  Nlo other major projects or acquisitions will be undertaken during
the period of construction of the Salto Osorio project except
in accordance with a financing plan satisfactory to the Bank
(para. 7.14);
(e)  Debt ratio will not exceed 60% and without the Bank's prior
approval no additional debt will be incurred unless internal
cash generation is more than 1.5 times maximum future debt
service requirements (para. 7.14);
(f)  Prior to the operation of the Salto Osorio plant, rates of
depreciation and of amortization, if any, of fixed assets
satisfactory to the Bank will be determined (para. 7.17).
8.02      The proposed project constitutes a suitable basis for a Bank loan
of US$70 million for a term of 25 years including a six-year grace period.

Facilities and Operations of the Principal
Utilities in South Brazil 1/
1.        Eletrosul owns the Charqueadas thermal (coal) plant (72 Mw) and
will own the Alegrete thermal (oil) plant (66 Mw) in early 1971, and the
SOTELCA plant in late 1971. The latter two plants are owned by Eletrobras
and the scheduling of the consolidation is reasonable and requires no Bank
action. The Alegrete plant is poorly located and will not have an adequate
market for some years, but the effect on Eletrosul will be small. Eletrosul
is building the Passo Fundo hydro plant (220 Mw) which will be in operation
in late 1972 or early 1973.
2.        COPEL, in 1971, will have a dependable peaking capacity of 363 Mw,
or 160% of its requirements, concentrated mostly at the recently completed
Foz do Chopim hydro plant (44 Mw) and the nearly complete Capivari Cechoeira
hydro plant (248 Mw). It has interconnections with south-central Brazil
plants which have been used for imports and soon will have an interconnec-
tion with a hydro plant in Paraguay. These interconnections will serve to
permit COPEL to meet its market requirements for some years to come and it
will continue to supply CFLP with wholesale power.
3.        CFLP in 1969 was capable of supplying 60% of its peak requirement.
Its principal generating plant is a 22.5 Mw hydro station. As noted above,
it purchases its remaining requirements of power from COPEL and SOTELCA.
4.        CELESC has a peaking capability of 78 Mw, equivalent to 74% of its
1969 requirements. The remaining amount is supplied by SOTELCA.
5.        SOTELCA owns and operates the Jorge Lacerda thermal plant (100 Mw)
in Santa Catarina, which will be enlarged to 232 Mw by 1973. It delivers
wholesale power to CFLP, CELESC, and CEEE.
6.        CEEE has 425 Mw of installed capacity and a peak load of 320 Mw.
However, the apparent surplus is not really available due to obsolescence,
inefficiency, and isolation of many of its plants. It purchases substantial
amounts of power from the Charqueadas and Alegrete thermal plants and some
from SOTELCA. CEEE's principal generating facility is the Jacui hydro plant
(150 Mw) and it is building the Passo Real hydro plant (125 Mw) to be completed
in 1973.

Internal Financial Rate of Return
1.        The internal financial rate of return of the Salto Osorio
project was determined as set out below, and is the discount rate at
which the present worth of the project's estimated capital cost equals
the present worth of the net revenue it produces over its life:
(a)  The estimated capital cost is shown in paragraph 4h06.
(b)  The life of the project is 40 years.
(c)  The annual net revenue is the estimated annual gross
revenue from the project less the estimated operating
costs, excluding taxes and depreciation. The estimated
annual sales are 484 Gwh in 1975, 1,606 Gwh in 1976 and
1,624 Gwh in 1977 and annually thereafter. The tariff
employed is Cr$0.087 per kwh corresponding to that
estimated in 1977 for the Eletrosul system, before
reflecting future monetary correction, with full opera-
tion of the project. The cost of service is calculated
on the estimated rate base and return allowed under
tariff regulation in Brazil (Annex 6).
(d) No allowance has been made for the higher internal
financial rate of return likely with a projected increase
of 50o in installed generating capacity of Salto Osorio
at an undetermined later date when other projects are
expected to provide upstream flow regulation.
2.        On the above basis, it was determined that the present worth of
the capital cost would equal the present worth of the net revenue over a
hO-year period at a discount rate of 15%.

Tariffs
1.        Regulations governing tariffs are contained in the Water Code
of 1934, subsequent amendments and decrees including decrees dated
February 26, 1957 and November 4, 1964, and Law 5,073 enacted August 18,
1966. Prior to 1964, tariffs were based on the use of the historic value
of investment and therefore did not reflect the substantial inflation
that occurred in Brazil. The 1964 decree allows utilities to revalue
their investment to reflect changes in price levels. The 1966 legislation
made yearly revaluations of assets mandatory.
2.        Under the existing regulations, tariffs are reviewed and
approved by the Department of Water and Power of the Ministry of Mines
and Energy every three years or at shorter intervals at the initiative
of the utility but with the approval of the Waters Department. Recently,
basic tariff applications of Charqueadas, Alegrete and SOTELCA have been
filed and approved annually. Utilities are permitted to apply for tariffs
which would yield revenues covering (a) operating costs including income
taxes; (b) straight-line depreciation of gross fixed assets in operation,
excluding land and land rights, at annual rates of up to 5% for thermal
plants and up to 3% for all other facilities including hydro plants but
with no effective minima in either case; (c) in addition to allowance for
depreciation, provision may be made for either amortization of up to 5%
or reversion of up to 3% of the total gross fixed assets in operation;
(d) losses on foreign exchange in the tariff period; and (e) a return of
10% on the remunerable investment. Charqueadas alone of the three com-
panies has provided for amortization. No provision has been made for
reversion, which mechanically requires a deposit of cash with the
Government that is withdrawn to pay for property acquired. Remunerable
investment is defined as the book value of the estimated end-of-year gross
plant in service (excluding assets acquired through contributions in aid
of construction) less depreciation and reversion or amortization reserves,
plus reversion or amortization funds and an end-of-year allowance for
working capital consisting of materials and supplies in an amount up to
3% of gross fixed assets in operation, receivables equivalent to two months'
billings, and cash up to the amount of the reserve for depreciation balance.
In principle, shortfalls in achieving the return of 10% in a given previous
tariff period (one year in the experience of the Eletrosul system) may be
recovered in the subsequent tariff period.

3.        Without advance approval of the Waters Department, between
tariff revisions surcharges may be added by utilities to current tariffs
to cover compulsory increases in wages, social benefits, cost of fuel and
purchased power, and increases in foreign debt service due to changes in
foreign exchange rates.
4.        Tariff adjustments on account of revaluation of balance sheet
accounts may be made as often as economic correction factors (coefficients)
showing the variations in the price level are calculated and published by
the Government. The coefficients are issued annually about one month after
the end of each year for the use of industry in general as well as electric
utilities. The coefficients are applied by utilities to update the values
of plant in service and work in progress, depreciation and amortization or
reversion reserves, and certain local currency loans of Eletrobras and of
the National Development Bank. Increased tariffs resulting from revalua-
tion of assets based on coefficients do not, however, completely offset
the effects of inflation. In any given year construction expenditures
incurred in the immediate prior year are not revalued. Furthermore, the
effects of inflation in the current year are not fully recognized because
utility plant is revalued as of the beginning of that year. In addition,
no price level adjustment is made for shortfalls in earnings which are to
be recovered in the succeeding tariff period. Foreign currency components
of the book value of fixed assets are converted into local currency at
the rate of exchange in effect at the time the assets are acquired, except
those assets constructed with the proceeds of foreign loans. In such
cases the rate of exchange initially used is that in effect at the date
of the signing of the loan contract; with the first repayment of principal
of the loan, an adjustment is made to reflect the exchange rate in effect
at the time of repayment. As offsets to the fact that remunerable invest-
ment does not fully reflect inflation, it must be recognized that cost of
service for a given year is related to remunerable investment as of the
end of the period and that both cost of service (which includes taxes on
income) and remunerable investment are based on estimated projections.
5.        The Eletrosul system in its tariff applications makes adjustments
to reflect the fact that tariffs for a given period generally do not go
into effect until some four or five months after the close of the calendar
year. Thus basic tariffs for a 12-month period ended in May 1971 have
been calculated on a rate base of approximately 7/12th the remunerable
investment at the end of December 1970 and 5/12th the remunerable invest-
ment at the end of December 1971. Charqueadas since 1964 has filed 5
basic tariff applications and put into effect 11 surcharges to adjust for
higher fuel and payroll costs. SOTELCA which began power production in
July 1965 has filed 5 basic tariff applications and put into effect 5
surcharges. Alegrete which commenced operations in September 1968 and
did not complete its transmission system until 1970, filed an initial
basic tariff application in September 1968 and a second application in
April 1970.

6.        In addition to a basic tariff and surcharges, consumers pay three
other charges. The Federal Government levies two charges to raise additional
resources for the financing of power development: a tax called the Imposto
Unico (sole tax), which varies among consumer classes, and the Emprestimo
Compulsorio (compulsory loan). These two charges do not apply to sales
to other utilities for resale which are the source of operating revenues
of the Eletrosul system. The sole tax rate is 47% for residential con-
sumers, 22% for commercial customers and 2% for industrial customers.
The compulsory loan rate is 35% for commercial and industrial customers;
the percentage for industrial customners is reduced for companies with
energy costs amounting to 3% or more of sales and more than 30% load factor.
The above percentages are applied not to the price per kwh actually paid
by the customer but to the fiscal rate, which is an average price per kwh
(fixed every 3 months by the Waters Department) realized by major Brazilian
electric utility systems. The proceeds of the sole tax, which was first
imposed in 1954, are distributed, after retention of 5% by the Ministry
of Finance, as follows: 37% to Eletrobras, which administers the Federal
Electrification Fund; 50% to the States; 10% to the municipalities; 1% to
the Ministry of Mines and Energy, and 2% to its Waters Department. The
compulsory loan, introduced in 1962 and scheduled to be discontinued at
the end of 1973, is administered by Eletrobras and invested in power
projects as share capital or as loans with an effective interest rate of
over 13%.  Eletrobras must allocate 1/2 the proceeds of compulsory loans
to the State of origin of the funds, but the State decides to whom the
funds will be allocated. Eletrobras decides whether its investment will
be made in debt securities or in shares. Eletrobras has stated that it
anticipates the compulsory loan will be extended beyond 1973. Customers
receive debt certificates for the amount of the compulsory loan paid; the
certificates are revalued annually, pay 6% interest and are repayable in
20 years. These securities generally have sold in the market in the
vicinity of 60% of the face value. Finally, the total rate for power
includes a social security tax amounting to 3% of the actual charge for
service (excluding the sole tax and compulsory loan) billed to the cus-
tomer.

Past Operations
1.        The Eletrosul system five years hence - 1976 - will be comprised
principally of properties being or to be constructed. Thus only limited
significance attaches to the three existing operating properties which
will be part of the system.
2.        Charqueadas, oldest of the Eletrosul properties, began operations
in 1962 and increased its generating capacity by one-third in April 1969.
Sales have fluctuated considerably, totaling 253 million kwh in 1967,
352 million in 1968 (a dry year requiring heavy use of thermal generating
facilities and power rationing in Rio Grande do Sul) and 299 million in
1969. Operating revenues in 1969 totaled Cr$28 million. Earnings (not
independently audited) as reported have included provision for amortization
as well as depreciation. Return earned in the years 1967-1969 on average
was close to 10% on remunerable investment and similar future returns are
expected. Almost 90% of the long-term debt of Charqueadas at the end of
1969 was owned by Eletrobras, which in 1969 increased to 100% its owner-
ship of Charqueadas shares. Accounts receivable on June 30, 1970 were
comprised principally of two months' billings to CEEE.
3.        SOTELCAts two generating units began operations in July 1965
and March 1966, respectively. Sales in 1967 were less than one-half the
1968 and 1969 levels of 380-390 million kwh. Operating revenues in 1969
totaled Cr$28 million. Following an operating loss in 1967, operating
income increased substantially in 1968 and again in 1969. Return on
remunerable investment increased to over 7% in 1968 and to about 9% in
1969. Future returns of 10% are projected. Progress in reducing accounts
receivables due principally from CELESC is expected in part because of
a new policy of charging interest on overdue accounts.
4.        Alegrete's two generating units began operations in September
1968 and the related transmission system was completed in 1970. Sales
in 1969 of 65 million kwh were very small in relation to fixed assets
and are expected to triple over two years. Operating revenues in 1969
totaled only Cr$6 million. The nominal operating income (not independently
audited) in 1969 was less than interest requirements and less than one-
tenth the estimated average annual operating income in 1971 and 1972.
The market is not adequate (Annex 2) to make practicable realization of
a 10% return in 1971 or 1972. Accounts receivable on June 30, 1970 were
comprised principally of two months' billings to CEEE.
