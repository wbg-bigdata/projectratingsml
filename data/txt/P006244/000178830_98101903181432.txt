INTERNATIONAL BANK FUR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVEIOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOW91ENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON THE PROPOSED LOAN TO
CENTRAIS ELETRICAS DO SUL DO BRASIL, S.A. WITH
THE GUARANTEE OF THE FEDERATIVE REPUBLIC OF BRAZIL
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan in an ar,iount in various currencies equivalent to $70 million to
Centrais Eletricas do Sul do Brasil, S.A. (Eletrosul) with the guarantee
of the Federative Republic of Brazil.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        The Bank has had a long and close association with the electric
power sector in Brazil dating back to 1949. Since then 22 loans totalling
$622 million have been made. The proposed loan would be the first to
Eletrosul.
3.        The Brazilian electric power sector has made impressive progress
in recent years in carrying out sector planning and investments necessary
to meet rapid growth of the power market. For purposes of sector planning
Brazil is divided into five regions - North, Northeast, Center-West, Center-
South and South. About 80 percent of the electric energy consumption takes
place in the Center-South and another 10 percent in the South. Power mar-
kets for the seventies in these two regions have been comprehensively
studied under United Nations-financed and Bank-executed studies. The
annual growth of demand is 9.7 percent in the Center-South and 10.8 per-
cent in the South, implying requirements of installed capacity by 1980 of
21,000 MW in Center-South (present about 8,000 NWrJ) and of 3,000 1MW in the
South (present about 1,000 MW).
4.        So far the Bank lending has been mostly in the Center-South
region and has made a significant contribution in securing the most
economic development of power facilities for this important industrial
area. Bank association has been useful in building strong enterprises
(FURNAS, C34IG and CESP) and in evolving governmental regulations that
enable the electric companies to contribute substantially to financing
their own investment from internally generated funds.
5.        The southern region is served by several small companies.
Important tasks for power development in this region are institution
building and sound project planning and development to meet regional
demand. The proposed loan is the first major generation loan in the
region and Eletrosul, the Borrower, is intended to become the predominant
generation and transmission entity in this area.

6.         The project was appraised by a mission which visited Brazil
in August/September 1970 and negotiations for the proposed loan were
held on February 16-1B, 1971.   Eletrosul was represented by Mr. Mario
Lannes Cunha, President; Mr. Fernando Marcondes de Mattcs and Mr. Agostinho
Pereira Ferreira, Directors. The Government was represented by Mr. Jaime
Alipio de Barros, General Counsel of the Ministry of Finance. Eletrobras,
the federal entity responsible for the development and financing of federally
sponsored power projects, was represented by Mr. Gabriel Costa Carvalho and
Mr. Jose Augusto Vieira de Carvalho.
7.         The proposed loan would be the 29th Bank loan to Brazil.   It
would increase the total of Bank loans to Brazil to $908 million (net of
cancellations).  The following is a summary statement of Bank loans to
Brazil as of February 28, 1971:

8.         No IDA credits have been made to Brazil.   IFC has made
commitments to companies in Brazil for a total of $49.5 million snd
presently holds $32.7 million for its own account.



9.        The table shows that substantial amounts are as yet undisbursed,
even on the power loans made in 1965. This is due to a number of factors.
As explained below, some of these reflect characteristics of power loans
to Brazil, and their effects on disbursements must be regarded as normal.
Also, substantial savings have been realized on equipment purchases.
Finally, there have been delays in the physical execution of several pro-
jects during the early stages of construction.
10.       Bank loans for electric power projects have been made for the
purchase of equipment and materials. In most cases delivery and installa-
tion are scheduled only when the civil works are substantially comipleted.
Moreover, a common feature of contracts between the Brazilian power com-
panies and suppliers of equipment and material is that progress payments
are not provided for. The combined result of these two factors is a
bunching of disbursements of Bank funds near the closing dates. Also,
there wJere substantial savings in some of the loans because prices rea-
lized in international competitive bidding were considerably lower than
initially expected. The Executive Directors have already approved the
utilization of some of the savings in respect of loans 404 BR, 403/h74 BR
and 442 BR for additional works related to the projects (R69-235, R70-148
and RR71-45 respectively). Additional savings are expected on some of
these and other loans made in 1965 and 1966.
11.       Physical execution of the projects was delayed in the case of
power loans 404 BR, 442 BR, 475-478 BR, 565 BR and 566 BR. You were
advised of the reason for the delay in the Xavantes Project (404 BR) and
you approved a two year extension of the closing date; construction of
the project has since been substantially completed. Unexpected foundation
difficulties delayed construction of Jaguara Project (h42 BR) by about
a year, of Volta Grande (566 BR) and Porto Colombia (5.65 BR) by lesser
periods which may be recovered. These technical problems have now been
solved and Jaguara is being commissioned this year, and work on Volta
Grande and Porto Colombia is progressing satisfactorily. You were advised
of the special problems of the Volta Grande Project (566 BR) recently,
when you approved transfer of some transmission works to the Jaguara
Project (422 BR). Implementation of the four power distribution loans
(475-478 BR) was initially slowed by organizational and administrative
difficulties encountered by the borrowers. Project management has now
improved and in the months, April 1970 - February 1971, substontial
disbursements (over $22 million) took place. Progress on other power
loans is satisfactory.
12.       The table also reflects delay in disbursement of the 1968
highway construction Loan (567 BR).  A Bank mission reviewed implementa-
tion of this project with the Government in October/November 1970 and
was generally satisfied with the progress of the project although the
Government's proposals for certain changes in the works are under
discussion. On the second highway Project of 1970 (676 BR), the engi-
neering and feasibility studies are on schedule.



13.       Although so far there have been no significant disbursements
of the loan to Banco do Nordeste do Brasil (BNB) (656 BR) signed on
February 16, 1970 we do not consider this abnormal; owing ts delays in
legal formalities in Brazil the loan became effective only on August
31, 197Q't $3.3 million have already been committed to sub-projects,
the Bank is currently processing sub-projects submitted by BNB that
could result in further commitments of $1.2 million and BNB is appraising
a sub-project requiring $4 million of Bank financing.
1h.       The Livestock Project (516 BR) was reviewed in detail with the
Government and terms of sub-loans changed in mid-1970. Commitments under
the Project have since picked up, but implementation is still slow. A
Bank supervision mission is at present in Brazil studying measures for
improvement.
15.       Projects suitable for future Bank lending in transport, electric
power, agriculture, education, steel, development finance companies and
iron ore export are presently being prepared in cooperation with the
Government and potential private borrowers. For two projects - an educa-
tion project and Sao Paulo water supply and pollution control project -
negotiations have been substantially completed, and in the next several
months I propose to recommend to you these two along with loans in the
transport sector and one for an iron ore export project.

PART III - THE PROJECT
17.       An appraisal report entitled "Appraisal of the Salto 0sorio
Hydroelectric Plant and Transmission Lines of Centrais Eletricas do Sul
do Brazil, S.A.r (PU-59a) is attached.
18.       The project consists of construction of the 703 MW Salto Osorio
Hydroelectric Plant on the Iguacu River in the State of Parana and
1,526 kns of 230 kv transmission lines interconnecting points in the
three southern states of Brazil - Parana, Santa Catarina and Rio Grande
do Sul.  Due to favorable natural conditions the estimated cost per kw
of Salto Osorio Plant is only $155, comparing favorably with the lowest
cost plant recently built in Brazil.   The project represents the most
economic form in which additional generating capacity can be provided.
19.       The Borrower, Eletrosul, was created in 1968 as a bulk pro-
ducer of power in the southern region. Eletrobras, the federal power
agency, holds 8o percent of the share capital, the balance being held
by the State of Rio Grande do Sul, National Coal Planning Cormission
and three other power companies. Eletrosul owns the Charquedas 72 ès'
thermal plant and the 220 MW Passo Fundo Hydroelectric Plant under cons-
truction, which will be completed in 1973. Eletrobras will transfer
two thermal plants to it in 1971 with existing capacity of 166 1W
being raised to 298 Mq. Ty 1975, before Salto Osorio is in operation,
Eletrosul will be the largest producer of power in southern Brazil with
an installed capacity of about 600 IW, some 30 percent of the regional
peak demand.
20.       The estimated cost of the project, excluding interest during
construction, is $152.3 million. The proposed Bank loan will cover
the cost of electrical and mechanical equipment needed for the project
and procured under international competition (estimated at $SL.8 mil-
lion); foreign exchange cost of engineering consulting, training and
managerial services (estimated at $5.2 million); and interest on the
Bank loan during construction ($10 million). Disbursement of about
$0.55 million for foreign exchange cost of engineering services for
which expenditures had been incurred prior to the signing of the loan
is proposed.
21.       Based,on past experience, Brazilian manufacturers are like-
ly to obtain about one-third of the contracts for the equipment for
the powerhouse and dam and about two-thirds of the contracts for the
transmission system - 50 percent of uhich will cover imported compo-
nents and materials. Thus, the proposed loan will finance some local
currency expenditure, estimated at $16.3 million. I consider some
local expenditure financing appropriate and justified in the excep-
tional circumstances of Brazil. Brazil has a large and relatively
sophisticated industrial sector that can produce most of the machine-
ry and equipment required by the economy. Although many industrial
components and raw materials must be imported, the need to import
capital goods, such as are usually financed by external credits, is
comparatively limited. On the other hand, despite a vigorous



- 7 -
domestic savings effort, Brazil will have to engage in a relatively
high level of external borrowir,g if it is to finance its substantial
remaining resource gap while at the same time meeting interest and
amortization payments on its large external debt. Wlith this combi-
nation of circumstances it is not possible for Brazil to obtain a
level of external assistance sufficient to sustain its development
program if external loans are tied exclusively to imports of capital
equipment for economically justifiable projects that need finance
and that are regarded as suitable vehicles by external lenders. The
economic missions which visited Brazil in recent years, including
the latest one, concluded that financing Brazil's capital needs would
require that external loans cover, on average, more than 4O percent
of the total cost of externally financed projects.
22.       The procurement of equipment under the loan will be sub-
ject to international competition with a 15 percent margin of pref-
erence.  Under our last power loan to Brazil (1Tarimbondo Hydroelec-
tric Project (PBOB))special charges levied on port traffic were
included in the landed cost of imported goods for bid comparison
purposes in accordance with Brazilian Government regulations.
These regulations are being changed so that in bid comparisons under
future loans, including the present loan, such charges will not be
added to the landed cost of imports.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMEITS AID AUTHORITY
23.       The draft Loan and Guarantee Agreements, the Report of the
Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank and a draft Resolution approving the pro-
posed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors separate-
ly. The provisions of the Loan and Guarantee Agreements are substan-
tially similar to those in other power loans to Brazilian enterprises.
PART V - THE ECONOMY
24.       An economic report on Brazil (WH-203a) dated January 22, 1971
has been distributed (R71-39)'.  Its findings are that in the last
three years the Brazilian economy has grown rapidly, inflation has
been reduced and international liquidity has been strengthened.
Prospects for economic development in the 1970s are good. Brazil
should be able to sustain a growth rate of at least 6-7 percent
per year while improving its external debt structure. No liquid-
ity difficulties are foreseen. Brazil continues to be credit-
worthy for substantial amounts of Bank lending.
25.       A basic data sheet is annexed.



- 8 -
PART VI - COMPLIANCE 1'1IH ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT
26.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VII - RECOI'MENDATION
27.        I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.
