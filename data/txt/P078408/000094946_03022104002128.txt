A. Project Development Objective
1. Project development objective
The objective of the project is to improve the fective and accountable use ofpublic expenditures through
capacity building and institutional strengthening for budget implementahon and oversight and increased
transparency ofgovernment institutions.
Improved human and institutional capacity for expenditure accountability will strengthen frontline service
delivery performnance, and thereby contribute to poverty reduction. The project seeks to strengthen
expenditure accountability by focusing on three primary components:
*  Strengthening Accountability Institutions
* Improving Financial Management Systems
* Enhancing Human Capital Development
2. Key performance indicators
While specific performance indicators are provided in the logical framework, by the end of the
project, it will be possible to characterize the public service as follows:
*  Transparent in budget fornulation, budget execution and budget reporting.
* Professional and timely in carrying out external and internal audits, thereby ensuring effective
utilization of resources.
*  Engaged and skilled Public Accounts Committee with the capacity to undertake its statutory
responsibilities.
*  Active community-level provision of feedback to decision makers on utilization of resources
at the sub-national level.
*  Networked financial management system (IFvIIS) that provides timely and quality data, with
internal controls mcreasing transparency and resource impact.
*  In the areas of expenditure management, a skilled public service cadre of accountants,
auditors, financial managers, IT professionals, and managers.
B. Strategic Context
1. Sector-related Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) goal supported by the project
Document number: IDA/R2000-224 Date of latest CAS discussion: December 21, 2000
The World Bank and Govemment have recently launched new CAS discussions. The project is
consistent with the Bank Group Country Assistance Strategy and the Malawi Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper (MPRSP). The project has been designed to support two of the MPRSP pillars: the
human capital development (MPRSP pillar 2) and promoting good governance (MPRSP pillar 4). By
strengthening human and institutional capacity in the public service, frontline service delivery will
improve, thereby indirectly addressing the other pillars of the MPRSP.
The 1998 CAS articulated four areas of focus, of which two areas are directly related to this project:
fostering human development; and improving public sector management and capacity.



2. Main sector issues and Governmemt strategy
The key sector issues focus on expenditure management and accountability, particularly budget
discipline, and a paucity of financial management capacity in the public service. From 1998 Malawi
made progress in improving macroeconomic performance, implementing structural reforms, and
development of democratic institutions. However, growth has been moderate (3% to 4% per annum)
and annual inflation remains high, in part because of slippages in fiscal and monetary policies. In
general terms, budgetary resources are spread thinly, with continuing pressure to over-spend, while
there continues to be large variations between planned and actual expenditures, excessive virement,
and non-compliance with financial rules and regulations. In addition, poor incentives and inadequate
capacity in the public sector continues to hamper the Govermment's ability to effectively and
efficiently carry out critical functions. These issues have been highlighted in the Malawi Public
Expenditure Review (PER), HIPC Tracking Assessment and Action Plan (AAP) and the draft Country
Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA).
Malawi remains very poor, with difficult development challenges exacerbated by a high incidence of
HIV/AIDS, severe drought and food shortages in 2002, heavy reliance on a few commodities, and a
low skills base. Likewise, there is increasing pressure to improve economic governance, particularly
given the need to account for HIPC resources, articulation of poverty reducing programs in the
MPRSP, and the Millennium Development Goals. The project will support the Government's efforts
to deepen public expenditure management reforms, improve governance by building Malawi's
capability to carry out budget implementation, enhance the transparency of public institutions, and
build capacity for more effective service delivery.
2.1 Malawi's public sector reform agenda
Since its transition to multi-party democracy in the mid-1990s, Malawi has undertaken a broad range of
public sector reform initiatives covering public expenditure management, administrative and civil service
reform, capacity building, anti-corruption, and decentralization.
Government has gradually instituted a Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) which seeks
to develop a strategic approach to budgeting and planning. Government has purchased and is
implementing an Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS) that will
significantly improve overall quality and timeliness of the Government's fiscal and financial data by
facilitating transaction reporting and accounting; automating processes such as cash management,
comrmtmnent control, receipts and payments; and gradually introducing accrual accounting.
Government has also reviewed aspects of its civil service system in order to strengthen the incentive
and institutional framework with pay and grading reforms and functional reviews of line agency roles
and structures. While Government has not embarked on large scale administrative reform, it has
begun hiring accounting professionals on contract, as well as outsourcing other activities, a new
housing allowance scheme has been introduced, and a performance contracting scheme is being
implemented. Over the medium-term, Malawi's administrative reform agenda will include a thorough
revision of job classes, grading, and salary structures in combination with systematic role
restructuring of central line agencies in anticipation of the decentralization of service delivery
responsibilities.
Improving public sector governance has also been a priority for the Government. The Anti-
Corruption Bureau (ACB) was established under the Corrupt Practices Act. Since its establishment,
the ACB has proven to be an increasingly credible mechanism for raising public awareness about the
costs of corruption, and more imnportant, investigating suspected corrupt practices by high officials.
Likewise, the role of the Ombudsman has been prominent, with more than 5,000 cases submitted
annually and significant declines in mal-administration reported in some agencies. Government has
made progress in consulting civil society and steps are underway to institutionalize regular monitoring
of budget and program implementation by local communities, NGOs, and other civil society groups.



- 3 -
Significant progress has been made in ensuring that a greater share of donor financing is being
recorded in the development budget, introducing program classification in the budget and encouraging
line ministries to comply with the requirements of the cash budget system. But despite these
successes, Malawi has made only modest progress in achieving fiscal discipline, and allocative and
operational efficiency in the public service. A range of structural or institutional deficiencies and poor
capacity continue to weaken virtually all stages of the budget cycle. Formal rules and procedures
governing budget formulation and appropriation, execution, and reporting are not adequately
enforced. Also, extra-budgetary requests, intended as emergency measures, have become a standard
practice. Moreover, the poor quality and lack of timely access to fiscal and macroeconomic data
continues to be a serious constraint on budget monitoring, as does weak internal and external audit
functions. Insufficient attention has been given to the monitoring of frontline performance, and
improving the key public management requirements for effective program implementation.
Cabinet has approved a paper on Public Sector Reform. Likewise, Government prepared its own
Concept Paper for FIMTAP and Performance Management in the Public Service (PMIPS).
Government aims, first, to focus on enhancing expenditure accountability through improved budget
implementation. Subsequently, efforts to introduce performance management systematically across
the public sector will link wage policy reforms to the role restructuring of line agencies in the context
of decentralization. This sequencing reflects the GOM's recognition of the difficulties associated
with implementing multiple reforms simultaneously with limited capacity. The approach also reflects
the emerging view that a strong fiscal track-record in terms of aggregate discipline and strategic
prioritization will provide a robust foundation for longer term administrative reforms.
3. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices
The project focuses on sector issues raised in the PRSP, primarily human capital development
(MPRSP pillar 2) and promoting good governance (MPRSP pillar 4). Likewise, the project supports a
sequenced approach to strengthening the public sector and improving expenditure management. The
primary components are:
* Strengthening Accountability Institutions
* Improving Financial Management Systems
* Enhancing Human Capital Development
Generally, Government suffers from weak accountability associated with poor compliance with formal
budget rules, insufficient quality control, and limited extemal oversight arrangements. But Malawi has
evolved a number of vibrant accountability institutions that play an increasingly important role in oversight
and advising Government. Some, such as the Public Accounts Conmmittee in Parliament have
institutionalized their mandate, and while they continue to suffer from a lack of skills and resources, are
contributing to increased accountability and transparency in Malawi. Other institutions need to be
significantly strengthened. The Office of the Auditor General and the intemal audit function have not
received adequate technical, professional, or financial support to effectively conduct analysis or canry out
investigative functions. Likewise, other important accountability activities such as performance and
expenditure monitoring (particularly by civil society) and adequate implementation of civil service
performance contracts are only now being fully addressed by Government.
The 2001 Public Expenditure Review (PER) and the draft CFAA notes that a viable MTEF begins
with improved budget implementation through inter alia improving compliance with budget
execution procedures, enhancing the timeliness and accuracy of reporting arrangements, and
strengthening ex post accountability. To this end, an integrated financial management information
system has been designed and adapted to the Malawian context. Pilots at five sites in three Ministries
were carried out, implementation m other ministries is near readiness and capacity building is
ongoing. In parallel with IFMIS implementation, key budget reforms are underway to improve the
efficiency, quality, and realism of budget preparation, execution and reporting. To support these

activities, significant resources are earmarked for the physical electronic infrastructure (Wide Area
Network).
Addressing the sector issues described above and improving economic governance and accountability
will require a volume and quality of skills not currently available in Malawi. While limnited numbers of
civil servants are trained each year, Government suffers from brain drain, poor skills-needs mix, a very
limited supply of critical skills, and limited capacity of training institutions. Within the context of a
sequenced approach to public sector improvement, Government will implement a strategic capacity
building program initially focused on financial management and accountability related skills.
An additional considerable strain on the Malawi Public Service is HIV/AIDS. While a MAP
programme is being developed for Malawi, the FIMTAP project endeavors to address the effects of
HIV/AIDS on the Public Service through a very intensive training program, which will train
substantially larger numbers than would be implied simply by a straightforward projection of skill
requirements. In addition, the project builds into the organization of work the presumption of a very
high attrition rate of staff - based on comparable experiences, the assumption used in building the
training program is that only one of every five people trained will remain in their job after five years.
Finally, in critical skills areas, the project training plans assumes that the principal job-holder is
shadowed by back-up specialists who are trained to take over as and when needed. This level of skills
development will be particularly important for IFMIS, external and internal audit, and maintenance of
the GWAN.
3.1 Strategic choices
The most important strategic choice made jointly by Government and the World Bank was to focus on a
narrow expenditure accountability project as the precursor to broader administrative and civil service
reforms in the future. While Government continues to address an array of public service issues, primary
focus within the context of World Bank support is on expenditure management, which will, in turn,
provide a solid basis for further reforms.

PFM: Public Financial Management; CSR: Civil Service Reform
Component 1. Strengthening Accountability Institutions
The objective of Component I is to strengthen a number of important institutions (Public Accounts
Committee, National Audit Office, Internal Audit Unit) that will, in tandem, usher in an era of
improved economic governance, reduced corruption, and improved allocation and utilization of
resources. Most of these institutions are directly linked, such as internal audit, external audit, and the
Public Accounts Committee, each of which depends on the other to fully exercise its mandate. While



these institutions provide oversight, other institutions will provide inputs to decision makers on how
well resources are being used. The performance contracting scheme will allow senior officials to
benchmark management impact, and to take actions needed to improve performance. Likewise, the
community level expenditure and performance tracking exercises will provide unique, grassroots data
to decision makers on budget implementation.
Component 2. Improving Financial Management
The objective of Component 2 is to electronically link Government with an integrated financial
management system that provides timely and quality data, while also providing enhanced internal
controls to improve expenditure management. The Government Wide Area Network (GWAN) will
eventually span the country and provide a backbone infrastructure for IFMIS as well as the personnel
and payroll system, the Government intranet, and email. The IFUIIS will allow all financial
management functions to be carried out electronically, greatly improving the availability of data and
reducing the opportunities for virement, corruption, and mal-administration.
Component 3. Human Development
The objective of Component 3 is to support creation of critical skills needed in areas of financial
management, auditing, accounting, management, and information technology in order to maintain the
improvements and reforms discussed above. The Capacity Building Facility will focus on critical
skills in a demand-driven environment and will supplement the national training strategy.
Component 4. FIMTAP Secretariat
The project will be managed by a project management unit, otherwise referred to as the FIMTAP
Secretariat. The FIMTAP Secretariat, supported by Technical, Steering and Financial Management
Committees will undertake overall implementation of the FIMTAP project. The primary
responsibilities of the FIMTAP Secretariat will focus on coordination, financial management,
procurement, monitoring and evaluation, and reporting. More specifically, the FIMTAP Secretariat
will be responsible for the following functions: (i) ensuring the timely and appropriate procurement of
all technical assistance, equipment, training, and related services required for the successful execution
of the proposed project; (ii) ensuring the timely identification and resolution of project execution
issues and the optimal application of successful improvement measures; (iii) evaluating the overall
performance of the proposed project, its individual components and project elements, providing
regular reports on project issues and progress; (iv) keeping and maintaining project accounts; and (v)
coordinatmg and preparing annual reports, audit reports and work plans.
The FIMTAP Secretariat will include a Project Manager, Financial Management Specialist
(accountant), Procurement Specialist, Monitonng/Evaluation Specialist, and required support staff.
The FIMTAP Secretariat will incur significant operating costs associated with the above tasks which
will be provided for under the credit. In addition, the credit will provide the FIMTAP Secretariat with
necessary computers, vehicles and other goods, as well as requisite training and consulting services.
The FIMTAP Steering Committee will be established prior to effectiveness and will comprise
officials from OPC, Principal Secretaries, and representatives of professional organizations. The
Steering Committee will provide oversight and will regularly review project progress. Likewise, the
Steering Committee will endeavor to ensure alignment between the FIMTAP and the PRSP. The
credit will provide general operating expenses for the Steering Committee.
2. Key policy and institutional reforms supported by the project
The key policy and institutional reforms are related to improved financial management. These
include implementation of financial management regulations, the strengthening of internal audit,
automation of the Government's budgeting and accounting system, and implementation of the



- 6 -
contracting scheme for top cadres. Indirectly linked to these policy actions are passage of new Finance
and Audit Acts which will provide the legal framework for improving the Internal Audit function and
strengthening the National Audit Office. Institutional reforms and/or strengthening are also critical
for overall economic governance and accountability. These will include a more robust role for
external audit and the Public Accounts Committee, and expanded monitoring of expenditures and
service delivery, and budget execution tracking.
3. Iemenefies and target populationn
The benefits of the project will be increased resource predictability in the public sector, greater
availability of quality fiscal and financial data, enhanced transparency of government functions, and
more developed human resources in the public service. These benefits will support frontline service
delivery performance, and thereby contribute to poverty reduction over the medium term
The project largely targets the following:
o Core economic management agencies and ministries
o Independent and Government accountability institutions
o Civil society
o Public sector agencies and their employees who will benefit from capacity building

4.2 Implementation
Each component of the project will be implemented according to terms and conditions acceptable to
the Bank. These terms and conditions will provide the basis for time-bound action plans, comnpetitive
bidding, and fiduciary oversight. The project plan of action, comprising comnponent specific logical
frameworks, the budget, the procurement plans and the project implementation plan, was agreed
between Govermment and the Bank prior to negotiations. The plan of action will be regularly updated
during project irnplementation.

4.3 Financial Management
The FIMTAP Secretariat will be responsible for mantaining accounting records for all project related
expenditures for all components following generally accepted accounting practices. Given the
responsibility of providing strong financial management to the project, additional capacity in
accounting and financial management is being added to the Secretariat. The Secretariat will utilize a
computerized financial reporting system and will employ a qualified financial manager. Oversight
will be provided by the Financial Management Committee established to monitor and take action on
risk areas in the administration of finance. The Financial Management Committee will be authorized
to prescribe preventive measures to ensure that project implementation is effective and timely.
Project records and accounts, including the Special Account and the Statement of Expenditures
(SOEs) will be audited annually in accordance with appropriate auditing principles consistently
applied by auditors acceptable to the Bank, and with terms of reference provided by the Bank. Audit
reports will be submitted to the Bank no later than six months following the end of the fiscal year.
4.4 Procurement
Procurement will be managed by the FIMTAP Secretariat. Each Sub-Component Manager will be
responsible for:
G  Preparing annual work plans and procurement plans
o  Developing terms of reference (TORs), short lists, and requests for proposals (RFPs) for
consulting assignments, and providing key inputs for the preparation of bidding documents,
including technical specifications, for goods contracts
* Establishing a procurement filing system and maintaining procurement documentation
e Participating in bid evaluation and short-list approvals
The Sub-Component Managers will clear their plans and procurement documentation with the
FIMTAP Secretariat Procurement Staff, which will play a central role in:
G Consolidating the annual plans of all components
a  Preparing bidding documents and providing technical advice to procurement staff of agencies
and departments
o  Advertising contracts when appropriate
o  Participating in the evaluation of bids and proposals
*  Preparing no objection letters for onward transmittal to the World Bank
o Advising Component Coordinators and Principle Secretaries on matters pertaining to
implementation of the project
o  Maintain necessary procurement documentation for the project
The procurement implementation arrangements follow on from procurement plans which have been
prepared for each sub-component. Inplementation of these procurement plans are the direct
responsibility of the sub-component manager, with oversight from the appropriate Principal Secretary.
The sub-component managers will:
o prepare TORs
o initiate the procurement of specific contracts through the FIMTAP Secretariat
o provide technical input to the Secretariat during various phases of procurement



- 9 -
* write advertisements for review by the FIMTAP Secretariat
* coordinate payment with the FIMTAP Secretariat and the Treasury
* provide quarterly reports to the FIMTAP Secretariat on implementation of the procurement plan
The master procurement plan will be managed by the FIMTAP Secretariat. The Secretariat will employ
two Procurement Officers and may employ additional procurement specialists or advisors as necessary.
The FIMTAP Procurement Officer will be responsible for the following:
* monitoring implementation of the master procurement plan
*  coordination of training for component managers and component staff regarding basic
procurement rules and guidelines, both for the World Bank and Government
* assisting sub-component managers in preparing TORs, advertisements, and other documents
* coordinating procurement with Government tender authonties and the Treasury
* placement of advertisements
* management of procurement processes for each contract, to include opening of bids,
evaluation, selection, etc.
* requesting no-objections and prior review from the World Bank
*  reporting to the Financial Management Commnittee and the FIMTAP Steering Committee
* providing quarterly reports to the World Bank, which will include procurement progress to
date, procurement methods, nature and amounts of contracts procured through each method,
number and amounts of contracts subjected to prior review, etc.
To ensure efficiency and economy, the FIMTAP Secretariat will undertake all procurement, except
where, within approved thresholds per contract and up to an aggregate amount on a monthly basis,
each component can directly undertake procurement of goods and services, as provided under
Government of Malawi procurement laws. Such procurement would be limited to consumables and
office operating expenses directly related to the project and will be included in the procurement plan.
The FIMTAP Secretariat will be responsible for all communication with the Bank on procurement
related matters.

4.5 Flow of Funds
Ensuring a consistent and transparent flow of funds is critical to project success. The principles for
flow of funds arrangement for FIMTAP are based on simplicity and accountability. Due to these



- 10-
principles, the flow of funds arrangements are largely centralized. There will be one Special Account
held by the FIMTAP Secretariat. All payrnents on contracts will be made by the FIMTAP Secretariat
for all components, with the appropriate debits being made to the Ministerial accounts through IEFMIS.
Hence, at the end of each procurement or delivery of goods or services, the Sub-Component Manager
will request payment be made on a specific contract.
For recurrent costs within Sub-Components, the Sub-Component manager will, on a quarterly basis,
submit Statements of Expense (SOE) to the FIMTAP Secretariat for recurrent expenses made directly
related to the project Upon verification by the FIMTAP Secretariat, a transfer will be made from the
Special Account to the Sub-Component account within the budget, hence repaying the Sub-
Component for project recurrent costs.
Each Sub-Component manager will be responsible for mnaintaining the sub-conponent budget, but
this will be maintained in coordination with the project accountant, who will maintain the mnaster
budget.
4.6 Monitoring and Evaluation
The complex nature of expenditure accountability and institutional reform require particularly strong
monitoring and evaluation. An external evaluation and review will be carried out mid-way through
the project. However, this review will not substitute for sound project management practices, which
require constant monitoring and regular evaluation.
The FIMITAP Secretariat will include a Monitoring and Evaluation Specialist who will monitor
expected outputs and outcomes, report to the Project Manager and GOM Task Manager on progress
and challenges and will regularly assess the efficacy of project management systemns, particularly
regarding the collection of data, compilation of analysis and the development of conclusions and
recommendations to inform future project action. Likewise, the Monitoring and Evaluation Specialist
will assist Sub-Component Managers in establishing reporting schedules, identifying existing data
sets, refining performance indicators, and drawing conclusions from studies and analysis.
The program design also recognizes that monitoring and evaluation is a critical and ongoing function
of Central Govermment. Ministries must be able to track key trends regarding economic growth,
expenditure management, poverty, and social indices. As outlined in the project description, three
activities support the cross-governmental monitoring and evaluation function, namely institutional
support to the National Economic Council, performance monitoring at the local level, and
monitoring/evaluation capacity building in line/sector ministries.
ID. Frojec¢e Raifon&He
1. Project aftermadves considered and reasons for rejection
It was agreed during project preparation that broad support for both aspects of the Government's
public sector agenda-namely, administrative and budgetary reforms-might be overly complex if
designed within a single operation. Moreover, conmnitment to the public financial management
agenda and capacity building is demonstrable and Government indicated its preference that the Bank
take the lead role in these areas. Some administrative reforms will continue with support from other
donors and with Government own resources.
Upon successful completion of key expenditure accountability reforms under this credit, alternative
types of projects, such as an Adaptable Program Loan (APL), may be applicable for future projects.

3. Lessons learned and reflected in proposed project design
The following lessons from the public sector reform experience in developed and developing
countries have been identified and incorporated in project design, as well as the recent
Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the IDP2 project:
Sequencing of institutional reforms improves credibility of the budget process. Experience across
African countries suggests that service delivery fails when budget implementation, expenditure
management and accountability is poor. Increasingly, reforming governments are focusing on
building the credibility of the annual budget process by focusing on downstream processes such as
execution, monitoring, and accountability. FIMTAP supports this strategic shift towards building systems
and strengthening institutions that improve budget implementation, before investing more heavily in
elaborated medium-term planning exercises.



- 12 -
Implementation targets should be realistic. Overly complex design and ambitious implementation
targets are unrealistic for low capacity beneficiary agencies. This leads to low disbursements during
the early stages of project implementation as well as delays in resolving procurement-related issues.
During preparation the number of components in the FIMTAP project was significantly reduced to
address complexity concerns. Likewise, it was agreed with Government prior to negotiations to
centralize procurement within the project and to expand the number of procurement staff in the
Secretariat.
Government ownership and commitment is key to institutional reform. Complex public sector and
institutional reforms place a premium on ownership and commitment at the highest levels. Key
components of FIMTAP such as IFMIS and capacity building have received significantly high levels
support, and commitmnent to objectives is perceived to be very high. The inclusion of key policy-
based conditions for negotiation, such as Cabinet commnittee approval of the Finance and Audit bills
also served as an indicator of Government commitment.
Public sector training can be provided efficiently when conducted in an agency-wide, demand-driven
environment. Historically, entrepreneurial individuals in the public sector have been able to seek out
training opportunities. The binding capacity constraint on frontline performance, however, is
providing training that is in line with institutional demands or agency-wide objectives. The capacity
building window in the project provide a sustainable, structured framework for training.
4. llndctidomns of borrower commitmenmt and ownershgp
Government initiated the project by preparing a Concept Paper which is aligned with the PRSP.
Borrower comrnitment has been very high at the level of the President, the head of the Public Service,
the Minister of Finance, and other high ranking technocrats. The overall strategic thrust of the
program (expenditure accountability and capacity building) has been championed by the Minister of
Finance, while the project directly responds to two pillars of the MPRSP of which the President has
been a significant supporter.
Component ownership is relatively strong based on the sub-component manager approach and
ensuring that Principal Secretaries are the accountable officers for each component. Likewise,
components situated outside central Government (Parliament, Extemal Audit) have strong
commitment, as these agencies see their role as unique and their inclusion in the project as fortuitous.
S. Value added of Bank support in this project
The Bank has been providmg support to the Malawi public sector reform agenda since the early
1990s. In addition to supporting aspects of civil service reform and public sector capacity building
under IDP2, IDA financed diagnostic work underpinning the GOM's framework for financial
management reforms. Revision of financial regulations were financed under FRDP III. Policy
dialogue on budgetary reforms have been ongoing as well. The Bank's contribution to the
formulation and design of FIMTAP draws on lessons from its past involvement with institutional
reforms in Malawi, international experience on budgetary reforms (including IFMIS implementation),
as well as more recent thinking on strategic sequencing of MTEF in the context of improved
expenditure management, as discussed in the 2001 PER
The donor community has increasingly expressed concerns about the governance of public resource
management in Malawi in recent years. Such concems reflect in part the intemational community's
interest in effectively tracking poverty-related spending of HIPC resources. They are also indicative
of the need, on the part of donors, to ensure the fiduciary safeguards that will enable more systematic
use of budget support as a modality for providing donor assistance. Against this backdrop, FIMTAP
will strengthen the "nuts and bolts" of the public sector financial management system, including
mechanisms for expenditure monitoring and accountability.

E. Summary Project Analysis
1. Economic
A number of economic benefits will be accrued through the project, which will lead to improved front
line service delivery and reduced resource leakages.
* Internal and external audit will be strengthened, leading to more effective control over the
variability of expenses due to improper or inappropriate purchases, allowances, and loss.
*  An integrated financial management system will provide for linlcages between the planned
budget and actual cash budget demands, thereby allowing managers to better schedule
expenditures to minimuze cash flow problems and improve service delivery.
*  Increased accountability for managers and more transparency across Govemment will
improve efficiency, reduce corruption and provide for a more conducive Public Service.
*  Enhanced capacity will provide the Public Service with skills to carry out critical tasks and
better manage implementation of core service delivery functions.
2. Financial
The financial implications of the project are related to improved efficiency in the budgeting process,
reduced leakages due to increased transparency, and effectiveness of public servants. Overall,
improved financial management will ensure better value for money, although direct financial benefits
may not be realized in the short term.
3. Technical
The project will utilize lessons learned in other reform programs, while regional experience will be
critical in implementation of the IFMIS and other complex sub-components. The strategy of focusing
on expenditure accountability and capacity building before launching a broad administrative reforrn
agenda will be reviewed on a regular basis to account for needed administrative changes and to ensure
linkages between expenditure management changes and potential restructuring, decentralization or
right-sizing of the public service.
4. Institutional
The institutional arrangements for managmg the project and for ensuring sustainable results build
upon experiences in earlier stages of the reformn program. The FIMTAP Secretariat will include
technical support personnel for Finance, Procurement and Monitoring and Evaluation.  The
Secretanat is housed in the Office of the President and Cabinet, thereby providmg a natural linkage to
the head of the civil service (Secretary to the President and Cabinet) and to public service reform
issues.
5. Environmental
Not applicable.
6. Social
By involving communities and parliamentary institutions in budget monitoring, the project will
promote demand-side pressures on Government and public officials at the national and local levels.
The empowerment of communities to hold government accountable will help forge the accountability
relationships necessary to deepen democratic decentralization and good economic governance in
Malawi. In addition the project endeavors to address the effects of HIV/AIDS on the Public Service

through a very intensive training program, which will train substantially larger numbers than would be
implied simply by a straightforward projection of skill requirements.

1. Swstainablity
The sustainability of reforms under the project depends on Government maintaining its strategic focus
on improving expenditure accountability through strengthening budget management and capacity
building. Specifically, maintaining strategic focus implies that: (i) the objectives and instruments of
reform are widely disseminated; (ii) senior staff are held accountable to the project's objectives; (iii)
the recruitment and retention of staff in critical areas is given top priority; (iv) the fiscal implications
of reform will be budgeted and costed on an annual basis; and (v) the impact of the project is
monitored rigorously to encourage learning-by-doing.
Real-time monitoring of the impact of new operating systemns such as IFMIS or accountability
mechanisms such as comnunity-based monitoring on budget implementation is essential. In addition
to assessing the effectiveness of various types of capacity building, rigorous monitoring and
evaluation provides the basis for continual adjustments in design and learning-by-doing.
Finally, sustainability will depend on the continued comrnitment of the political and technocratic
leadership and the cascading support to middle management and throughout the entire public service.
Sustainability over the longer term will be predicated on ownership of reforms and building adequate
capacities for improved service delivery.
2. Critical Risks
Implementation of the project poses various technical, managerial, and coordination-related
challenges for the Govermment. In addition, significant change management issues are likely to
emerge as new operating systems, institutional reforns, and significant investments in upgrading
capacity are introduced into a weak public sector environment. A variety of risk mitigation measures
have been taken to ensure that investments in Malawi's capacity to manage its public resources
accountably and transparently are sustainable.

Annex 2: Detailed Project Description
MALAWI: Financial Management, Transparency and Accountability Project (FIMTAP)
The objective of the project is to improve the effective and accountable use of public expenditures
through capacity building for strengthened budget implementation and increased transparency of
government institutions. Improved human and institutional capacity for expenditure accountability
will strengthen frontline service delivery performance, and thereby contribute to poverty reduction.
Regarding governance, Government generally suffers from weak accountability associated with poor
compliance with formal budget rules, insufficient quality control, and limited external oversight
arrangements. But Malawi has evolved a number of vibrant accountability institutions that play an
increasingly important role in oversight and advising Government. Likewise, other important
accountability activities such as performance and expenditure monitormg (particularly by civil
society) and adequate implementation of civil service performance contracts are only now being fully
addressed by Government.
The project focuses on sector issues raised in the PRSP, primarily human capital development (pillar 2) and
promoting good governance (pillar 4). Likewise, the project supports a sequenced approach to strengthening
the public sector. It was agreed during project preparation that broad support for both aspects of the
Government's pubhc sector agenda-namely, administrative and budgetary reforms-might be overly
complex if designed within a single operation.
The benefits of the project will be increased resource predictability in the public sector, greater
availability of quality fiscal and financial data, enhanced transparency of government functions, and
more developed human resources in the public service. These benefits will support frontline service
delivery perfornance, and thereby contribute to poverty reduction.

Component n. Strenugthening Accountability llnstitutions
1.1 PubRic Accounts Committee and Biudget Committee
The role of Parliament, particularly the Budget Committee (BC) and the Public Accounts Commnittee
(PAC), is paramount to ensuring expenditure accountability for public resources. The National
Assembly in Malawi is attempting to assert its constitutional role in holding Government accountable,
but the Assembly and the comrmittee system face numerous constraints.
Capacity Weaknesses: Capacity of members is generally low, although a number of donor-supported
skills development programs are being implemented. The skill levels of staff (researchers, clerks,
etc.) are particularly low and little support has been provided to develop a well-functioning committee
support structure. Staff serving the committees are also presently serving as procedural clerks, hence
there is need to review the institutional arrangements governing the committee system overall in order
to ensure the PAC and BC are able to operate in an enabling environment. Even with improvements
in the enabling environment, committees will require capable, dedicated staff support. At present,
committees such as the BC and PAC are severely understaffed. Only six clerks, including the Clerk
of Parliament, serve 18 committees of Parliament. Both the BC and the PAC are provided with
commnittee secretaries to assist with administrative issues of the committees, but these secretaries are
also required to assist with table duties in the Chamber. Research support to committees is limited at
this time, as there are only two research officers serving the 18 Committees.
While adequacy of staffing is in part a function of funding of posts under establishment, support for
committees also depends on the capacities of existing staff. These officers are quite junior, and serve
largely as generalists. They therefore may not have a clear understanding of the issues, thereby
limiting the quality of analysis and infonnation that the committee can access without the use of
outside consultants. There is need to build staff knowledge in critical areas such as economic policy
analysis, public financial management, poverty monitoring, and other areas critical to expenditure
accountability.  Staff development and training is particularly important as a basis for
institutionalizing in-house expertise over the long-term.
Members of Parliament also require continued training in the basics of parliamentary procedure.
Several donors are supporting PAC and BC members with technical expertise, assistance in the
preparation of reports to parliament, support for pre-budget consultations, and various forms of
training. Additional training for Members will be required in key areas related to oversight functions
such as developing capacity for questioning of witnesses, leadership skills for committee
Chairpersons and Vice Chairpersons, as well as upgrading of Members' understandmg of the role of
committees.  Members can particularly learn lessons through participating in regional and
international parliamentary activities.
nstitutional Issmes: The Malawian National Assembly faces a number of institutional constraints.
For example, committees meet infrequently and there is limited public access or participation. Little
work has been undertaken to educate the public of Parliament's role or to engage citizen experts in
committee deliberations. For the PAC and BC to fulfill their constitutional responsibilities it will be
necessary for the committees to consult civil society and involve citizens m the legislative process, as
well as disseminate findings and reports to the public.
As was noted above, the absence of a committee departrnent hampers the efficiency and effectiveness
of all committees. Generally, a committee department is a pre-requisite for support to committees.
Once a committee department is established a staged staffing and development plan can be
implemented. Such staff can be pooled and be responsible for serving more than one committee
under the direction of a Head of Committees. Both researchers and clerks will adhere to standardized
training programs based on a client needs assessment and an orientation to the committees.



- 21 -
To address the constraints outlined above, the project will support the following:
Capacity Building for Staff and Members:
*  Development of a consolidated 5-year staffing and professional development strategy to assist
in closing gaps in the committee system, with a focus on the PAC and BC;
*  Attachments of committee and research staff from SADC and other regions to the PAC and
BC to encourage staff to learn from the experiences of others, as well as facilitate the
strengthening of regional cooperation;
*  Training of staff in basic skills areas such as computer literacy, financial management, project
management, monitoring and evaluation, and auditing;
*  Training of Members of the BC and PAC (through annual issues seminars) in areas related to
budgeting, public financial management, economic policy, accounting, and the role of
committees;
*  Support for Members of the PAC to attend the Association of Public Accounts Committees
(APAC) annual training sessions.
Institutional Strengthening:
*  Design and installation of a database of expert resources from civil society for the research
section for use in developing witness lists and briefings for committees;
*  Capacity buildmg support for the establishment of a Committee Department including a needs
assessment and provision of equipment;
*  Support for dissemination of committee findings and reports, as well as civic consultation.
Critical Success Factors and Risks: Success of thus sub-component requires the necessary steps in
strengthening the commnittee system, especially through the establishment of a Committee
Department. Equally important will be the need for Parliament to recruit additional clerks and
researchers, specifically for the BC and PAC. Capacity building must be carried out in tandem with
institutional strengthening.
Expected Outcome: The expected outcome is the strengthemng of the legislative oversight function
and committee system. The sub-component will improve the effectiveness of key committees such as
the PAC and BC to investigate issues related to the govemance of public resources.
Sub-Component Management: The sub-component manager will be the Clerk to Parliament. It may
be necessary to provide intermittent project management expertise to this office, and it is expected
that the FIMTAP Secretariat will provide financial management and procurement support.
Donor Coordination: The sub-component will be coordinated with donors supporting Parliament, to
potentially include the UNDP Parliamentary Training Program for Members of Parliament, CIDA's
Capacity Development for Participatory Democracy Project, and the National Democratic Institute
(NDI) program of support to the National Assembly.
1.2 External Audit
A credible pubhc audit system can be measured by the predictability and consistency of its operations
and reports as an institution of accountability. The auditing role in the public sector is performed by
the Malawi National Audit Office (NAO). The NAO has historically suffered from poor capacity and,
at times, limited ability to fully exercise its mandate. Audits of the Government accounts are
generally at least one year behind schedule and suffer from poor quality data and analysis. But to



- 22 -
improve economic governance, Government has committed to strengthening the role of the NAO. A
new Audit Act has been drafted with support from donors which will establish NAO with new
independence. The new act will allow NAO to employ staff on a market basis, i.e. de-linked from the
Public Service Commission, and will provide the NAO with a stable, long term budget. In addition,
the NAO is beginning to expand its staffing levels, upgrade technologies, and establish a public audit
training program.
NAO has been supported by the FRDP III Technical Assistance Credit, whereby a number of
consultancies have prepared reports on training, quality control, restructuring, performance audits, etc.
Likewise, NORAD/SIDA have provided advisory services leading to recommendations on the
institutional and legal framework. Support under FIMTAP will largely be focused on implementation
of recommendations following from the FRDP III TA and other donors assistance.  This
implementation will require international expertise to develop a new business plan, on the basis of
which staffing and skills levels will be determined. In addition, the implementation support will
directly follow from the Malawi Public Expenditure Review, HIPC Expenditure Tracking Assessment
and the Country Financial Accountability Assessment, which all provide recommendations for
improvement of the NAO business environment.
Quality and timeliness of NAO's deliverables are important, while training and access to information
(both externally and within the NAO) are some of the building blocks that the office will require to
ensure timely reporting to the legislature and other stakeholders. Likewise, within FIMTAP, the
linkages between NAO and Parliament will be strengthened through joint training, increased capacity,
and increasing independence afforded to both institutions.
To address the constraints outlined above, the project will support the following:
Iusddoial Strehgeageening
o Review of operations and development of a business plan for the medium term drawing upon
recommendations from studies on personnel, code of ethics, quality control, training, delivery
systems and performance management. Local consultancies will be utilized to assist NAO in
implementation of recommendations and development of a business plan.
O  Realignment of staffing and critical skills with increased emphasis on investigations and
statutory reporting, drawing on the recommendations for personnel, to include organizational
structure, grading, institutional anrangements, appraisals, and succession.  Local and
international consultancies will be utilized in the realignment.
o  Installation of technology to enhance analysis of accounts, reporting, inter-NAO communication,
audit management, and off-site data capture. This will include the purchase of computers,
software, and associated hardware.
Capacity BmUding
o  Building upon work already undertaken by consultants, a long term human development plan
will be implemented. The credit will support further design of this plan, implementation
manuals, ongoing monitoring and evaluation, and tracking of skills sets and needs.
o  Capacity building in critical skills areas such as auditing, accounting, investigations, report
writing, etc. Training needs have been tentatively identified and types of trainlng outlined, to
include managerial, intemal strengthening in audit methodology, assistance in upgrading
qualifications, technical training, administrative training, and special training requiring
international courses. In this regard, the NAO will hire a training manager to coordinate
training activities and oversee internal development of training materials. Proposed courses
have been identified, while technical assistance will be required to develop the courses and
*train trainers.



- 23 -
* The NAO suffers from a lack of computers and other technology. An aggressive IT training
program will be undertaken in cooperation with other donors, some of which are providing IT
equipment. Training will be contracted to local training providers and will be staged in line
with computer procurement.
External Audit Policy
*  There are a number of policy-related areas, whereby the credit will support changes m
External Audit policy. These include technical support necessary to finalize the draft Public
Audit Bill and related legislative review (particularly the Constitution); and onentation on the
role of external audit for the Public Accounts Committee and other oversight institutions.
Most of these activities have begun, but will need ongoing support to ensure effective
completion.
Critical Success Factors and Risk: The critical success factors will be passage of the proposed Audit
Act by Parliament and close coordination with other donors supporting the NAO, particularly
NORAD and SIDA.
Expected Outcomes: The expected outcome of the sub-component is that improved public financial
management will result from the strengthened oversight and efficient reporting of the NAO.
Sub-Component Management: The sub-component manager is the Deputy Auditor General. It may
be necessary to provide intermittent project management expertise to the office, and it is expected
that the FIMTAP Secretariat will provide financial management and procurement support.
Donor Coordination: NAO is currently negotiating a project with NORAD/SIDA for short and
medium term training, which may begin in 2003. Training activities planned under FIMTAP will be
coordinated with the NORAD/SIDA program when it becomes effective.
1.3 Internal Audit
For the past ten years responsibility for financial management, including intemal audit, has been
decentralized to each Ministry. There are approximately 175 mtemal auditors, spread over 10-15
Ministries and Departments. Within these units, auditors tend to predominantly occupy junior grades
(mainly clerical officer) and lack training in basic auditing. It is widely perceived within Government
that internal auditors have little independence from Controlling Officers. The total number of skilled
personnel is inadequate, and existing personnel are regularly moved between working on accounts
and audits. The main function of intemal auditors is currently on pre-audit, i.e., checking vouchers
before they are paid.
International audit practices make a clear distinction between the checking of vouchers (part of the
accounting line function) and verifying or reviewing control systems (the audit function). In most
countries, internal audit is not concerned with other processes, such as maintenance of commitment
registers, writing up cash books from checks paid, reconciliations with bank statements, and
submission of monthly and annual reports to the Treasury and Accountant General.
In an effort to improve the internal audit function, Government is undergoing a re-centralization of
internal audit. DffD has financed international experts to assist with the design of this process, who
have submitted a final report to Government. The credit will support strengthening of intemal audit to
ensure an effective and efficient organizational structure, capacity development, and prudent
governance structures.
Organization: Government will establish a new, centralized Department of Internal Audit within the
Office of the President and Cabinet, headed by a Director of Internal Audit. The Department will be



- 24 -
staffed with a Director, Deputy Director, 6 Chief Auditors and 6 Principal Auditors. The Chief
Auditors and Pnncipal Auditors will be organized according to, and responsible for, specific
nmnistries as well as specific sectors. There will be about 150 personnel making up the Internal Audit
Service who will be rotated through Ministries and Departments based upon pre-determined work
programs. Significant investrnent will be needed in establishing the Department, re-orienting staff,
and managing a change process involving numerous ministries, high-level officials, Controlling
Officers, accounting and auditing cadre, the Auditor General and the Accountant General. The roles
and responsibilities of internal audit cadre are being clarified and will be reflected in revised civil
service job grades in cooperation with DHRMD and the Public Service Commission. The role of
internal audit will move from a pre-audit function to reinforcing financial management compliance
through regular review of control systems and reporting on their weaknesses.
Capacity Bmiding: Nearly the entire audit cadre will need to be re- trained. Institutions such as the
Malawi College of Accountancy, Staff Development Institute and Malawi Institute of Management
will play a prominent role in creating a public internal audit skills base. The training program will be
managed by the Departnent of Internal Audit, in coordination with the Auditor General, MOFEP,
DHRMD, and the professional accounting body. It is envisaged that training/re-training of nearly 200
internal auditors will be required, to include local government auditors.
Governance Structures: Prudent governance of mternal audit is critical for independence and
success. Malawi is implementing a new internal audit system whereby the internal audit cadre will be
managed by the Office of the President and Cabinet, as opposed to the Ministry of Finance. Given the
unique circumstances, special attention is given to governance structures for implementation success.
Principles for internal audit have been clearly defined, while international best practice and regional
experience will be utilized to develop the full governance structure. Under the PPF, study tours
visited neighboring countries such as Botswana and South Africa with effective internal audit. The
Internal Audit Department will contract with international consultancies for advisory services on
internal audit as needed. In addition, particular attention will be paid to critical reporting relationships
such as those between internal auditors and Controlling Officers, the Department of Internal Audit,
the Ministry of Finance, the Auditor General, the Internal Audit Committee.
Internal auditors will report professionally to the Director of the Department of Internal Audit, which
will be responsible for: a) human resource management of the Internal Audit Service; b) career
development and training; c) job standards; and d) work programs. The grading and responsibilities
of the cadre need to be defined m accordance with the job grading system. A short-term consultancy
will assist m the preparatory work in setting up the Department.

The work programs for internal auditors will be coordinated between the Department of Internal
Audit, Controlling Officers and the Treasury, with input from the Intemal Audit Committee. Intemal
auditors will be placed within line and sector miimstries, and their day-to-day reporting will be directly
to Principal Secretaries in the agencies to which they are posted.
The Governance structure will maintain the integrnty of the broad stewardship role of the Mimster of
Fmance for resource utilization across the public sector, while providing the opportumty to re-institute
a well trained, focused Internal Audit Service. Government has noted that the Finance Act will be
amended to provide for the management of intemal auditors within OPC. While this arrangement
departs from the tradition, it will not necessarily erode the fiduciary role of the Ministry of Finance,
assuming the governance structures are adhered to, and that intemal auditors are properly carrying out
their function. The role of the Intemal Audit Committee will be primary to assure these govemance
structures and maintain proper reporting procedures.
As part of its central role in public financial management the Treasury issues instructions and
circulars in the discharge of this responsibility and should supervise their enforcement through direct
coordination of internal audit workplans, as well as maintam responsibility for improvements/changes
to Treasury operations.
An Intemal Audit Commnittee will comprise officials of the Ministry of Fmance and Office of the President
and Cabinet, Accountant General, Auditor General, Director of Intemal Audit, representatives of line and
sector ministries and representatives of accounting and auditing training institutions and professional
bodies. The role of the Intemal Audit Commrittee will be to review intemal audit reports and make
recommendations to Govemment regarding systemic mtemal control issues.
Intemal audit will provide key support for the Office of the Auditor General. Good intemal audit will
allow extemal audit to focus on broader issues and over time, move towards performance auditing. To
address this reorganization of internal audit the project will support the following:
Reorganizafion:
.  The credit will support the assessed institutional and organizational requirements of a
strengthened intemal audit function, which will include financial and personnel implications
of creating an Intemal Audit Department, as well as the roles and responsibilities of uitemal
audit cadre, management and reporting lines.
*  Organizational management consultancies will provide ongoing technical and change
mnanagement support.
*  Intemational advisory services, funded from the credit, will provide strategic implementation
and policy inputs.
Audit Training:
* The credit will support a training needs assessment, followed by course development in basic
audit for junior auditors, as well as training in information technology, management (for
management grades), report writing, investigation, etc.
Governance Arrangements:
*  The project will provide intemational and regional expertise in design and implementation of
a well operating, transparent governance structure that provides for improved intemal
processes and procedures.
* The project will support establishment of the Internal Audit Committee, to include developing
a terms of reference, manual, and operating guidelines.



-26 -
Critical Success Factors and Risks: Success of this sub-component will hinge on the re-orientation of
internal audit from a pre-audit function, to a quality of control system function; as well as acceptance
of the internal audit function as a mandate of the Office of President and Cabinet. Each supervision
mission will include an internal audit specialist to assess progress and impact, and the mid-term
review will include a strategic diagnostic review of mternal audit in Malawi.
Expected Outcomes: The expected outcome of this sub-component would be to strengthen Malawi's
financial and expenditure management system by enhancing compliance with Treasury rules and
regulations.
Sub-Component Management:    The sub-component will be managed by the Internal Audit
Department once it is established. Prior to establishment of the Internal Audit Department, the Deputy
Principal Secretary, Finance, in OPC will serve as the sub-component manager.
Donor Coordination: The sub-component will be coordinated with potential ongoing support from
DfID, which have funded the initial analysis on reorganization.
1.4 ?erformnimce ComtractIng
In July 2000 Government of Malawi moved to a voluntary three year contracting scheme for all civil
servants graded S4/P4 and above with a performance measurement component. The new contracts
offer higher (fixed) remuneration, with continuation or renewal of contracts subject to satisfactory
performance. For instance, base salary for a P4 officer has increased from Malawi Kwacha 21,000 a
month to Malawi Kwacha 35,000 a month. The scheme also offers a further increase, rising to 15%,
accordmg to ratings on a five-point scale.
The performance measurement aspect is to be based on 10 performance factors, with a standard
weighting attached to each. While the contracting scheme has been initiated, the institutional support
to fully implement the scheme, to include regular reviews and dispute processes, is not in place. The
credit will support ongoing reviews of the performance criteria, to include issues such as financial
management; orientation programs for implementation; development of the dispute resolution
process; and guidelines and procedures:
][Pnplereeataon:
o Ongoing, annual reviews of all performance factors will be financed by the credit. These
reviews will allow Goverunent of Malawi to improve the perfonnance criteria on an annual
basis (performance contracts are also on an annual basis), particularly where specific criteria
should be more highly emphasized, such as financial management perfonnance criteria.
O  An orientation program will be required for all contract officers and ministers on a regular
basis. Initially, DHRMD will hold ten one-day workshops (up to 30 participants in each
workshop) to explain the new system and how to conduct performance appraisals, including
appraisal of accountability performance.  Additional workshops will be held as new
contractees enter the scheme. The orientation program will be supported with international
experience, facilitators, and mediators, as needed.
o  The credit will also support regular personnel audits, that will support development of
strategic plans and adequate monitoring of perfornance contracts.
Dispuae IResolution:
o  A system for registering and processmg disputes over performance reviews, performance
benchmarks and contracts, and issuing decisions will be established under the credit to ensure
that an appeals system works efficiently. DHRMD will investigate disputed measures,



- 27 -
distinguish between controllable factors and exogenous factors determining an officer's
performance, and provide support as required. An Appeals Panel has been named, consistng
of a High Court judge, the Ombudsman and the Auditor General. It will be formally
constituted by OPC.
Guidelines and Procedures:
*  With support from the credit, Government will develop procedures manuals for preparing
performance agreements, undertaking open appraisal of senior cadres, as well as appeals and
grievance procedures;
*  On a regular basis Government will commission a review of guidelines and the contracting
handbook to assess the impact of the scheme;
*  The credit will support progress reviews on the generation of strategic plans and report on
common issues, and review migration procedures to contract appointments;
*  Consultancies will be utilized to develop a monitoring framework for implementation of the
scheme, and advise on the appeals process and procedures.
Given the institutional weaknesses in developing ministerial strategic plans, unpredictable resource
flows, and weak safeguards against political interference in the fiscal system, full implementation of
an output-oriented performance management system will be phased over the medium term. During
this process one area that will be addressed through the review of performance factors is financial
accountability, which in many instances is a prerequisite to output-oriented performance management.
In this context, the review of performance factors may shift criteria in performance agreements for
Controlling Officer and senior accounting cadres with sigmficant cash control responsibilities,
drawing on laws and regulations such as the Secretary to the Treasury's Statement of Core
Expectations for Departmental Financial Management. Financial management criteria may include
the timeliness of monthly financial reporting, submission rates for CCS returns, reduction in the build-
up of arrears, timely completion of annual accounts, sound asset management, promptness of action
on audit queries and findings, and low level of extra-budgetary requests.
There will be an annual review of the performance factors in order to ensure they adequately reflect
the contracted jobs and meet international good practice. Performance factors may be changed
annually for all civil servants and are not directly linked to their three year employment contract. The
review of performance factors will be undertaken by national and international experts in a
participatory manner.
To address potential pitfalls in the contractmg scheme, the credit will also support a system of
personnel audits and strategic planning within DHRMD that will better allow senior officials and
contracted employees to make informed and realistic agreements regarding performance. The
personnel audits will be undertaken on an ongoing basis to provide managers with information on
civil service skills and demographics. The personnel audits will be linked closely to the personnel and
payroll system. Likewise, btaining will be undertaken with senior officials and contracted employees
on strategic planning.
Critical Success Factors and Risk: The main risk to the credibility of the contracting scheme arises
from the delay in performance appraisal. Intemational expenences shows that early ratings are likely
to be highly skewed upwards.
Expected Outcomes: The expected outcome of the sub-component is improved civil service
management performance.
Sub-component Management: The sub-component will be managed by DHRMD.

1.5 Expenditere Tlracking
Experience in Africa has shown that expenditure and performance tracking at the community level is
an important aspect of expenditure accountability. Ensuring that funds and services reach target
communities is also a critical element in monitoring implementation of Poverty Reduction Strategies.
The credit will support a pilot community-based public expenditure and performance tracking survey
program. The program will include a series of annual survey exercises to track expenditures and
communities' perceptions of progress m service delivery. This infornation can then assist policy-
makers to assess the development impact and cost-effectiveness of various interventions, and it will
build capacity of communities, local organizations, and local govermnent officials to undertake
monitoring and evaluation activities.
Responsibility for various aspects of monitoring implementation of the MPRS is divided among four
core institutions, as follows:
o Ministry of Finance (MoF/EP): tracking expenditure inputs and outputs
o National Statistics Office (NSO): national survey program, national databank
o National Economic Council (NEC): monitoring poverty outcomes and impact
o Department of Local Government (DLG): imnplementation of MPRS at the District level
A steering committee of government officials from these four institutions will assure oversight of the
expenditure tracking pilots financed from the credit. The pilots will be carried out in four Districts.
Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) units will be established within these District Assemblies and
community-oriented committees will be established in each of the four pilot Districts. The National
Economic Council will manage the project component and coordinate the different activities.
ID) esigi of ]Piloes:
A consultancy is planned to address key elements of survey design. These include areas such as
assessing existing monitoring and evaluation (M&E) methodologies being used by Government,
NGOs and donors at the national and community level, and proposing how these may be consolidated
into a national monitoring and evaluation system. In addition, the consultancy proposed options for
specific instruments to be used in the pilots of community-level expenditure and performance
tracking, and assess the capacity of communities to undertake M&E activities and identify their
capacity building needs and requirements.
WVhile the exact design details of the pilot survey program will partially be determined by community-
level needs and activities already underway in the pilot Districts, survey arrangements are envisaged
as described below. In each year of the pilot, the survey program will consist of three components, to
be run concurrently in the chosen communities in each of the pilot Districts: (1) a community or
facility based input and expenditure tracking exercise; (2) development of community scorecards on
services; and (3) a qualitative participatory poverty assessment. Surveys will be timed so that results can
feed directly into the national process of annual budget review and allocation. In the fourth year of the
project, if considered feasible in relation to the status of implementation of the national financial
management system, a fuller public expenditure tracking survey (PETS) is envisaged, building upon the
national M/E strategy and other donor and Government-funded PRSP monitoring activities.
I.iplementaflon of he flPots:
The pilots will be carried out in those communities in the four pilot Districts where development
interventions have taken place in priority poverty areas (e.g. education, health, water supply and
agricultural extension). For the purpose of the survey program, "community" will be defined either as
all the villages under one group village chief, or as all the villages benefiting from a particular public
service facility (e.g. school, health clinic, water source). Data collection will be sub-contracted to



-29 -
local Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) or other appropriate local institutions operating in the
pilot districts, in partnership with appropriate Local Government staff.
The National Economnic Council will be responsible for final analysis and ongoing dissemination of
information on poverty outcome results, and their policy and budget allocation implications, to key
decision-makers and other stakeholders, includmng communities, and for presentation of findings
during the annual MPRS implementation reviews. A research fund will be financed by the credit to
cover ad hoc studies to identify or test new approaches in community-based public expenditure and
performance tracking. Detailed guidelmes concerning the criteria for use of these funds will be
agreed pnor to effectiveness.
Capacity Building:
To support this sub-component, the FIMTAP project will finance WBI poverty analysis training for
key stakeholders, and training in M&E, including community-based survey design and administration
for local institutions, and for staff of the District M&E units. International consultants appointed in
relation to training and survey administration activities will be required to work with local
counterparts and training institutions, in order to build local expertise and institutionalize poverty
analysis training.
Monitoring and Evaluation:
Monitoring and evaluation will be an on-going activity of the project and sub-component management
team. Mid-way through the project, an evaluation will be done of the survey program. Towards the
end of the project, an evaluation will be undertaken of the pilot survey program and related programs
ongoing in the country. The evaluation results will serve as an input to the development of a national
program for public performance and expenditure tracking.
Expected Outcomes: The expected outcomes of the sub-component are increased efficiency in the allocation
and utilization of public resources, and empowerment of communities to influence decision makers.
Sub-Component Management The sub-component will be managed by NEC, which is also
undergoing a significant capacity building programme. The FIMTAP Secretariat will provide
financial management and procurement support as needed.
Donor Coordination: Performance monitoring cuts across all aspects of the Bank's and donor's
projects. The Malawi Country Team has committed to improving monitoring and evaluation in the
portfolio, with an increased M/E focus in the CAS, CPPR, and within projects under preparation.
Close linkages are being established between this activity and poverty monitoring exercises and PRSP
monitoring, which are supported by donors. In addition, NORAD and Govermment of Malawi are
discussing a program of support that would address capacity constraints in the National Statistics
Office and the National Economic Council.
Component 2. Improving Financial Management Systems
2.1   IFMIS
A process has been underway for approximately five years to automate Government financial
management systems (IFMIS) necessary to ensure accurate and timely flow of critical financial
management information and fiscal data. The implementation of IFMIS is key to Government's effort
to modemize Malawi's public financial management system and improve expenditure management.
The design and customization of the IFMIS application was supported under the Second Institutional
Development Project (IDP2). Since the close of IDP2, the Government received technical advice and
support from various donors and sought to test the functionality of the system, run pilots, and
undertake training.



- 30 -
Malawi's experience in implementing IFMIS has been mnixed, which reflects the complexity of IFMIS
in general, and the paucity of skills in areas critical to the information system. Malawi's experience
mirrors that of other countries in Africa where roll-out of IFMIS is often difficult. To this end,
Government of Malawi is learning from experiences in Tanzania, Uganda, South Africa, and Ghana to
avoid pitfalls.
In an effort to reap the greatest benefits from IFMIS, focus is being placed on improving financial
management processes, internal controls, and accountability mechanisms, while at the same time
instituting the requisite equipment and skills. The credit will support refinements and improvements
to technical specification of the IFMIS. During implementation, the credit will support significant
technical assistance, hardware/software purchase and training. Activities to be financed under the
credit are outlined below.
llniproviag ]Desige:
The Malawi IFMIS is in a continued process of design improvemnent, with lessons learned from
ongoing pilots and international experience. Followmg a long period of limited progress due to
numerous factors, during the latter stages of FIMTAP preparation, significant improvements were
made and IFMIS is ready for roll-out to line and sector ministries. These improvements included an
upgrade of the entire CODA Financials Software to the latest version, which in turn resulted in the
addition of key modules, such as procurement, as well as expanded the report writing function and
improved screen shots.
In addition, a number of technical specifications were met that enhanced design for application in the
Malawi context. These included removing below-the-line accounts from operational budgets and
reducing payment duplications by harmonizing human resource related items with the personnel and
payroll software, as originally designed. The customizations undertaken improved the software to
address gaps in the budget and accounting procedures and tighten internal financial controls by the
use of double passwords and a clear allocation of responsibilities among accounting cadre and
controlling officers.
Consultancies working during project preparation addressed development of the budget recording and
commitment control modules; improvements to the software application to ensure recording and
maintenance of budget data at the sub item level; improvement of software application to ensure
maintenance of quarterly expenditure plans, monthly cash requirements by cost centers and allocation
of CCAs to budget lines; and strengthening of the cash management (CCA), check reimbursement and
receipts business processes.
Pilots of the CODA Financials software were carried out during 2000-2001 and re-tested in 2002 due
to less than adequate controls and procedures during the original pilots. These pilots and testing,
while on the one hand delayed implementation of IFMIS, also provided invaluable information to the
IFMIS team regarding functionality, technical specification, and implementation complexity. The
lessons learned were incorporated in the upgrade and customization. The upgraded version of CODA
Financials was re-launched in the pilots sites and functionality was verified by World Bank staff prior
to negotiations. At that time it was determined that adequate improvements had been made to IFMIS
and that implementation could proceed in line and sector ministries.
A major component of the project is to build Government's capacity to manage the ongoing
development of IFMIS and the associated change management process, as well as full implementation
of the system. A detailed training plan for the training of trainers and end users for the pilots and roll-
out has been prepared. For successful implementation, a new management structure for IFMIS was
instituted during project preparation with a full time IMFIS manager and a staff of five full time
accountants and IT specialists.



- 31 -
Capacity Building:
*  The credit will support capacity building to include the procurement of consultancies,
hardware, equipment, software licenses, and training, relevant to further development of the
software application and successful completion of system testing.
* Strengthening of the project management team will take place through local and international
training and secondments from neighboring countries.
*  The program will implement an enhanced program for training of trainers and end users.
Implementation:
*  International consultancies and advisors will be provided to assist in implementation, trouble
shooting, and continued refinements.
*  In-house training will continue, although local training institutions may also be required for
some skill levels.
*  A comprehensive monitoring and evaluation system will be established, with participation
from the Office of the Accountant General, Treasury, DHRMD, OPC, and operating
ministries.
* A special task force will be established to oversee the implementation of IFMIS to decentralized
posts and to assess needs and challenges regarding decentralization/deconcentration and IFMIS.
* The credit will finance the user license fees for CODA Financials, as well as finance the
primary implementation and maintenance contracts.
Critical Success Factors and Risks: The critical success factors are firstly ensuring Government-wide
commitment to the IFMIS. Given the delays to date, there is considerable pessirnism across Government
regarding the effectiveness of the IFMIS. Secondly, the component will require particularly good
management, given the large procurements and complexities of implementing the system across all of
Govemment
Expected Outcomes: The expected outcome is more efficient and higher quality financial management. In
this regard IFMIS will provide the information needed by controlling officers to develop better budget
estimates and control spending. Likewise, the system will decrease the opportunities for corruption and
will lead to increased financial management transparency.
Sub-Component Management: The IFMIS component is managed by the Office of the Accountant
General, while DISTMS will have full responsibility for the IT support necessary for IFMIS.
Donor Coordination: DfID provides some technical assistance on an as-needed basis.
2.2    Government Wide Area Network (GWAN)
Goverment of Malawi is establishing an electronic infrastructure to support numerous mtranet/intemet
capable functions including emnail, IFMIS, PPPAI (payroll and personnel), and distance learning. With
support provided under IDP2 Govemment developed a robust electronic network architecture at Capital Hill
where the majority of Ministries are located. This systern is a closed network coupled with existing
infrastructure provided by Malawi Telecommunications Limited (MTL). Costly and slow dial-up facilities
are available outside the capital.
Various risks have become apparent during the installation of the WAN, including shortage of staff to
maintain the system, lack of standards and general guidelines to maintain network integrity, lack of a
Government Information Commumcation Technology (ICT) strategy, insufficient virus detection



- 32 -
software, and purchase of network utility software for GOM's general use which are pending. The
next phase of the GWAN roll-out includes expansion of the network, estabhshment of institutional
structures and capacity to manage the system, system protection, and ensuring umnterrupted power
supply. The credit will support the following:
Ex,pansion of the lNetworh: Two aspects of expansion will be addressed under the credit. The first is
to expand the Capital Hill network to City Center where additional government offices are located.
This will be a fiber optic expansion. Outside Lilongwe, particularly in regional administrative
centers, more cost effective wireless LANS equipment consisting of transceivers connected via
Ethemet cables to servers or other segment of the network will be utilized. Likewise, radio,
microwave and laser technologies will be used to complement the wireless networks in the regions.
Using systems such as Spread Spectrum radio coupled with narrow-technique broadcast signals over a
wide range of frequencies can avoid problems inherent with narrow-band technologies.
Power Supply: The Government's network is prone to electrical outages, leading to loss of data,
productivity, and hardware. In Malawi, electrical connections are polluted with surges and spikes. The
credit will support a series of Uninternuptible Power Supply (UPS) umts and generators to provide
electrical power to computer and other devices during power shortage or irregularities. The UPS units will
serve computer rooms with appropriate cooling systems, servers, backup systems, and desktop PCs.
Sys'eei Protecion: Networks are susceptible to damage both by virus and unauthorized human
access. The Malawi network has been plagued by computer viruses which have affected the entire
network, and primary applications such as PPPAI have been cornpromised. This risk will increase as
the network expands, as some viruses can infiltrate any network when users are logged on. The credit
will support the purchase and installation of virus detection software. Likewise, it is important to
ensure appropriate security systems protecting all hardware and software against abuse and damage.
The network administrators will implement appropriate file and directory rights for the end-users and
develop guidelines, standards, and delineation of file rights. In addition, techniques to authenticate
users, ensuring that users log off when communication is over and restricting workstations with
critical access, will be implemented. It is mandatory that the network be equipped with software that
authenticates emails and file attachments downloaded from the internet, and that a log system of all
downloaded files should be kept separately by the system's administration. Measures to prevent
physical abuse will be taken against theft of all costly equipment. High security and climate
controlled computer rooms will be allocated to data centers where servers reside.
Management and Capacity: Through the credit, Government will establish a facilities management
unit to oversee utilization, standards and maintenance of the GWAN. For this unit to function
effectively, significant capacity must be built for DISTMS staff. As part of this process, Government
will review the human resource requirements for WAN maintenance and IFMIS administration, and
system operators during roll-out. Where appropriate, alternative arrangements will be considered
including the outsourcing of discrete functions provided that the confidentiality of sensitive
information can be preserved. Training of DISTMS staff and IT professionals will be closely
coordinated with the capacity building Facility to ensure maximum effectiveness of training
resources. Likewise, a focus of improving both management and capacity will be to expand the
GWAN awareness program across Government.
Governmentt 1  SC7 Straegy and IPolicies: Proper maintenance of GWAN will be facilitated by a clear
ICT strategy and government policies regarding information technologies. For example, it is
imperative to ensure that Government-wide information systems can be integrated seamlessly in the
future. It is even more important that individual ministries or districts do not attempt to automate
accounting systems, procure hardware or software, or establish ministerial networks without proper
coordination and vetting by DISTMS. Such standards and guidelines are particularly important for
IFMIS, which will require that procurement of such automated systems meet specific standards and be
subject to approval by the IFMIS Technical Committee.



- 33 -
Critical Success Factors and Risks: The key success factors associated with the WAN development
and maintenance involve the recruitment and retention of qualified personnel, the availability of
uninterruptible power supply, and strong coordination among Government agencies.
Expected Outcomes: The expected outcome of this sub-component is that an applications-driven
approach to investing in information technology would be further embedded, a platform for the
implementation of IFMIS and other Government information systems established, and finally,
connectivity for Government officials to leverage internal and external information enhanced.
Sub-Component Management: The sub-component will be managed by DISTMS.
Donor Coordination: UNDP provides some technical assistance on an as-needed basis.
Component 3: Enhancing Human Capital Development
3.1 Capacity Building Facility (Training Facility)
The Malawian civil service suffers from low capacity across the spectrum of job grades and
professions. The provision of training to public sector employees is a high priority for Government
and has been highlighted in the PRSP. In an effort to design a capacity building program that is
responsive to current needs, addresses critical areas such as financial management and can be
implemented at value for money, Government has reviewed lessons from Malawi's past experience as
well as those of other countries such as Uganda, Ethiopia, and Kenya in the provision of training in a
demand-driven environment.
Following extensive consultations with training institutions, the Department for Human Resource
Management and Development, donors and development practitioners it was agreed that the most
effective and efficient broad capacity building measure for the public sector would be a fund-type
mechanism providing key skills, many focused on expenditure management, across ministries.
Operation of the Facility: The training Facility will be managed by DHRMD m close coordination
with the FIMTAP Secretariat, component managers, line ministries and other donor programns
supporting training and capacity building. The Facility will be financed through budget line item-
funded activities, and will not operate as an extra-budgetary or mdependent Facility. It will initially
focus on primary public sector management skills that support accountability. These will include
areas such as financial management, procurement capacity, records management, information
technology, strategic management, data analysis, project management, leadership skills, human
resource management, etc. Focus skills may be added or dropped depending on demand and strategic
skills needs. Each Ministry, Department or Agency will carry out a training needs assessment (the
ongoing capacity assessments will provide valuable input) and will submit training needs to DHRMD.
Resources under the credit will be utilized to pay on contracts with training institutions to provide
standard courses or specialized training. In some cases, resources under the credit will be utilized to
pay for longer term regional or intemational courses, but again, the resources will be paid to the
training institution.  To reduce transactions cost of procurement, training institutions will be
encouraged to bulk together training in their proposals (for example, accounting, auditing and
principles of financial management). Only in very limited cases will the resources under the Facility
be utilized for intemal training, and in these cases the resources will only be utilized for instructors,
facilitators, or tramers, not for recurrent expenses associated with intemal training.
Assessment of Training Needs: DHRMD will draw upon human resource development plans within
each ministry, the ongoing capacity building assessments, other donor-funded needs assessments, as
well as a multi-ministerial needs assessment funded by the credit to determine specific training needs.
But the assessment will also require each ministry to submit their own training needs assessments. To
facilitate this submission, orientation seminars will be provided to all personnel and training



- 34 -
departments across Government. The ministerial training needs assessment will provide the key input
to a comprehensive "training plan" funded by FIMTAP. The training plan will include both skills
development financed from the training Facility, as well as areas of critical skills development
supported within components.
Based on an external evaluation, it was agreed that most courses will range from 1-7 weeks in duration,
with most lasting approximately two weeks. The needed duration of courses will be further defined during
the training needs assessment and development of individual Terms of Reference for specific courses.
Taining, Ynsf(doas: All training institutions in Malawi will be invited to submit an expression of
interest to participate in the Facility. From this pool an evaluation will be undertaken to "pre-qualify"
training institutions eligible to provide training services under the Facility. Detailed guidelines have
been prepared for this process and a joint committee (DHRMD, FIMTAP Secretariat, and training
service providers) will oversee the qualification and selection process.
Resources under the credit can also be provided to enhance the capacity of training service providers where
those institutions are Malawian public good institutions and it is established that increased training
institution capacity will significantly improve the ability to provide capacity building within the framework
of the training plan. Resources from the credit will only be provided on a matching grant basis.
Cose S$harg: Based on the recommendations of an external consultant, a cost-sharing formula for
training activities has been developed to ensure some costs are bone by Govement, and specifically by
the beneficiary agency or department, in line with the National Training Policy. To maintain parity among
civil servants, most training will be limited to approximately seven weeks and will take place in Malawi.
Evarnairo: Government of Malawi will undertake student evaluations, which will provide inputs to
revision of the training plan on an annual basis. Likewise, an evaluation of all training providers will
be conducted annually.
Lessors   z'eairedfroo mlDPI Feflowship Fund: Following closure of IDPII a review workshop was
held to assess the performance of the Fellowship Fund. Design of the Capacity Building Facility
benefited from this review by taking into account issues such as: a) inadequate staffing of training
institutions; b) poor monitoring and evaluation; and c) absence of training plans.
Tknspaireicy, Demand and ]Tnpact Evelmadon: Operational Guidelines have been developed that
outline procedures for the Facility to ensure transparency. Likewise, an ongoing assessment of needs
and required inputs from participating ministries will ensure the Facility remains demand dnven.
Crndcal Sccess Faceors and RA?isks: A key success factor is the awareness among beneficiary and
training institutions of the access riles to the Facility. Secondly, aggressive monitoring and evaluation of
the Facility will be needed to ensure it is meeting real demand, is being implemented transparently,
and to ensure the highest impact.
&xpected Grgtcomaes: The expected outcome is to efficiently and rapidly train public servants m areas
critical to the objectives of FIMTAP as well as public management in general. In addition, the
Facility is expected to encourage the development of a competitive training sector compnsed of
numerous private and public providers.
Sub-com,ponent Maagemeng: The training program will be managed by DHRMD in coordination
with the National Training Policy, while the FIMTAP Secretariat will oversee procurement and
financial management.

General
Procurement of goods and services will be carried out following Annual Procurement Plans agreed with
the World Bank as part of the Project Implementation Plan. Procurement of goods and works will be in
accordance with the Bank's "Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" (January
1995, revised in January and August 1996, September 1997 and January 1999) and procurement of
Consulting Services will be in accordance with the Bank's "Guidelines for Selection and Employment of
Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" (January 1997, revised September 1997, January 1999, and May
2002). The Bank's Standard Bidding Documents (SBD) will be used for all International Competitive
Bidding (ICB) and the Bank's Standard Request for Proposals (RFP) will be used for consulting services.
Procuremenet Plan
The Borrower has a procurement plan that provides aggregate amounts for each procurement method.
Every six months, the procurement schedule will be updated by the FIMTAP Secretariat for the following
year, including the number and estimated costs of items to financed under the Credit following the model
procurement plan.
Procurement Procedures Manual
A Procurement Procedures Manual has been developed which will guide all procurement work and will
detail the procurement process and management of procurement implementation for the project. The
Procurement Procedures Manual will then be included in the Implementation Manual, which will be
approved by the Financial Management Committee and the FIMTAP Steering Committee.

Dverall Irocuremenmt IRisk AssessmeEnt: High Risk



- 44 -
The project has a high procurement risk as there is no past experience in the FIMTAP Secretariat. The
predecessor project has closed and the procurement staff are located elsewhere. There is no capacity for a
capacity assessment at this time, hence the high risk.
Actions
It has been agreed that supervision frequency will be increased from the standard two mission to three
times per annum. In addition, the FIMTAP Secretariat has established an action plan that includes, as
necessary:
o  Procurement training for FIMTAP Secretariat Procurement Staff
o  Procurement training and orientation for FIMTAP Component managers
o  Hiring of short term procurement consultants
o  Hiring of a procurement advisor
o  Updating of the procurement manual on a regular basis
o Conducting an annual internal procurement review and audit
o  Conducting, jointly with the World Bank a one year review of procurement management for
FIMTAP
Disbursenieat
Use of Sgtaements of Expenditires (SGOEs)
Unless and until the project opts to use report-based disbursements, disbursements will be made using
traditional procedures. Full documentation will be required for payments on all contracts over the
respective prior review thresholds for goods and consultancies. The Statement of Expenditures (SOE)
procedure will be used for: a) contracts for goods valued at less than US$100,000; b) contracts for
services of consulting firms valued at less than US$100,000; c) contracts for services of individual
consultants valued at less than US$50,000; d) training activities; and e) operating costs. When the SOE
procedure is used, supportng documents will not be submitted to the Bank with withdrawal applications,
but will be maintained by the FIMTAP Secretariat and made available for review by Bank supervision
missions.
SpecialAccount
A Special Account (SA) will be opened through a commercial bank in Malawi. IDA will be informed of
the account opened by the bank and will deposit funds with the account once the project is effective.
The initial disbursement amount for the SA will be US$2,000,000. Thereafter, replenishments by IDA
may be increased. Disbursement requests will originate from the Office of the President and Cabinet
(OPC) and be endorsed by the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning (MOFEP) Claims Unit prior
to a withdrawal being made from the SA for payments to suppliers. Some payments will be paid through
the local account and all related documentation will be maintained by the FIMTAP Secretariat for review.
The SA will be audited by an independent auditor acceptable to IDA which would be appointed prior to
Credit effectiveness based on an audit scope as contained in terms of reference acceptable to IDA. The
audited accounts will be submitted to the Bank six months after the end of each fiscal year from review.

Annex 6A: Financial Management and Disbursement Arrangements
MALAWI: Financial Management, Transparency and Accountability Project (FIMTAP)
Overall Assessment
The FIMTAP project will be implemented in a medium to substantial risk environment. As outlined in
the recently completed draft CFAA' , Malawi Public Expenditure Review Report-Issues and Options2 and
Tracking Poverty-Reducing Spending in HIPCs: Country Assessment and Action Plan for Malawi3, there
are problems with Malawi national budget execution. There is poor linkage between policies that govem
budget formulation and outputs from the same, less transparent budget execution methods, inadequate
assurance that allocated resources are used economically and efficiently for the intended purposes and an
absence of private sector participation in the budget management system. Govemment-wide bank
reconciliation processes have significant shortfalls and are normally a year or so in arrears.
The Auditor General's annual reports cite a number of cases of fraud, loss and poor accountability, and a
failure to reconcile large balances in govermments accounts. Below the line expenditures are significant
and have not been reconciled to their respective bank accounts for significant periods of time. Of
fundamental concem is the inability of the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning to control budget
to its intended purpose.
Financial laws and regulations in Malawi are adequate and accounting standards generally meet
intemational standards. In January 2001, Malawi adopted the Intemational accounting standards
promulgated by the Intemational Federation of Accountants (IFAC) without amendment as a basis of
disclosure and preparation of accounts of entities operating in Malawi. The public sector, however, does
not yet utilize these standards. There is a professional association of accountants (The Society of
Accountants in Malawi-SOCAM) and Malawi is a member of both IFAC and regionally Eastem, Central
and Southem Federation of Accountants (ECSAFA). The accounting profession is well developed,
especially in the private sector although the number of qualified accountants is still very small; with the
public sector accounting capacity being very inadequate.
Malawi moved to program budget classification from fiscal year 2001/2002.  The budgets are
consolidated by the Ministry of Finance and approved by Parliament. The Principal Secretary for each
ministry, who is the controlling officer, is responsible for executing the budget. Extemal audit for all
govemment institutions is required by statute. Though very weak, each ministry has an intemal audit
function which checks compliance with prescribed systems.
Action Plan to Increase Capacity for Financial Management
It has been agreed that supervision frequency will be increased from the standard two missions to three
times per annum. In addition, the FIMTAP Secretariat has established an action plan that includes, as
necessary:
* Financial management training for FIMTAP Secretariat accounting staff

4.     FIlMTA] Secretriat (orect Management)
The lead implementing agency will be the Office of the President and Cabinet in the form of the FIMTAP
Secretariat. Sub-components will not carry out financial management and disbursement activities for the
project, rather this will be concentrated as a primary task of the Secretariat. Sub-component managers
will use an agreed, annual procurement plan to initiate transactions relating to their components. Such
procurement activities will be handled by the Procurement Specialists at the Secretariat.  All
documentation for payment for services, works and goods procured will be sent to the Secretariat
regardless of the component. Upon receipt of such documentation, the Secretariat will send such
documents to the component managers for verification and authentication of the same. It is only after
such authentication has been received and counter checked at the Secretariat that requisite payments will
be made from the local Bank account or the Special Account of the project.
Each sub-component will be responsible for keeping a ledger of expenditures incurred under the project,
though all payments relating to their activities will be carried out by the FXMTAP Secretariat. The sub-
component ledgers will be used for the sub-component managers to track budget and procurement, as
well as to reconcile the master budget and procurement plan maintained by the Secretariat. These ledgers
will also be particularly important for tracking government counterpart funds received per quarter and for
reporting to the Budget Director.

The financial management capacity of the FIMTAP Secretariat has been assessed as weak in terms of
human capacity and the strength of government systems. The previous Public Sector Reform operations
in the form of IDPI and IDPII have used government accounting systems which were weak as outlined
above. As such, the assessment recommended that a new system outside the government system with an
acceptable interface with the IFMIS be designed to be used in this project. The design was agreed upon
prior to negotiation. The same will be computerized to facilitate timely and accurate production of
accounts and other requisite reports.
Since the project total costs are above US$20 million the project needs one qualified accountants and one
assistant who is close to finishing his professional examinations. The IFMIS component will also need to
have one accountant to maintain memorandum of expenditures incurred on the project owing to its
complexity and size of the component. The IFMIS accountant shall work hand-in-hand with the two
accountants at the FIMTAP Secretariat to ensure that contractual payments are made on time and the costs
reflected at the Secretariat are in tandem with memorandum books kept by him/her. A detailed action plan
to strengthen financial management of the secretariat is contained in the capacity assessment report to the
Task Team Leader with copy to the Govemment of Malawi-specifically the FIMTAP Secretariat.
Budget codes to reflect project expenditures through IDA and government contribution will be reflected
in the Government budget as well as in the newly designed accounting system as the project will be
linked to the Government Accounting System. The project accounts will comply with international
accounting standards and Bank requirements for accounting, auditing and reporting. The budget codes
developed will provide a linkage between the cost elements of the FIMTAP project to outputs and
outcomes as defined as monitoring indicators of the operation.
A FIMTAP Steering Committee will be responsible for monitoring project implementation and a
Financial Management Committee will be responsible for reviewing all financial management matters of
the project on a quarterly basis. The project accountants will be responsible for coordinating and
facilitating the audit of the project semi-annually and at the end of each fiscal year and ensuring that it is
submitted to the Bank six months after the end of the fiscal year. Description of such reports will also be
included in the final version of the Project Implementation Plan (PIP).
Budgetary and Accounting Systems
Guidance for budgeting of GOM entities is currently governed by the Finance and Audit Act Chapter
37:01 assisted by Treasury circulars. The Act stipulates accounting and audit requirements from
government entities and government managed projects in general. The instructions define responsibilities
and level of authority within the Ministry.  The Treasury Instructions and circulars require all
Government ministries to submit expenditure returns at the end of each month outlining expenditures
incurred during the month, commitments made and cash balances in their holding accounts at the Reserve
Bank at the end of such months. The project will follow a blend of instructions emanating from the
newly designed system and instructions from government.
Agreed Financial Reporting Formats
The project will prepare and produce quarterly Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs). The FMRs will
comprise a financial report, a physical progress report, and a procurement report. These reports will
provide information on the progress of the project in terms of financial activity, key output measures and
procurement for the relevant quarter. As for financial reports, they shall include a statement showing for
the period and cumulatively cash receipts by sources and expenditures by main expenditure classification,
beginning and ending cash balances of the project; and supporting schedules comparing actual and
planned expenditures. The reporting line items in the FMRs will follow the project's chart of accounts.



- 48 -
The cumulative FMRs over the project year will be used as the project's annual financial statement. This
will result in a more cost effective reporting.
As for physical progress report, the project will include a narrative write-up and output indicators linking
financial information with physical progress and highlight issues that require attention. In procurement
reports under the FMRs, such reports will provide information on the procurement of goods, work and
related services, and the selection of consultants, as well as compliance with agreed procurement
methods. This report will compare procurement perfornance against the plan agreed at negotiations or
subsequently updated and highlight key procurement issues such as staffing and building capacity.
The currency for the FMRs will be Malawi Kwacha with the equivalent in dollars as a parallel colurmn.
This will become beneficial because while as the books of accounts for the project will be kept in
Kwacha, those of the special account will be in dollars which will give rise to issues of translation. The
FMR preparation and submission will be done on a quarterly basis. These will be used as a basis of
disbursements. These will be submitted to the TTL within forty five days of the reporting period. If such
FMRs are not provided timely, the TTL will follow this up with the FIMTAP Secretariat to determine the
reason for the delay and planned date for submission. Late submission may result in the application of
legal remedies for non compliance.
Since configuration of the finalized FMRs will take time, the project will maintain accounts manually to
limited computerization and will disburse under the traditional disbursement methods initially. During
this time, the accounting system will produce a summary Statement of Expenditures and a statement of
withdrawal schedule, a balance sheet if deemed necessary, special account statement and notes to the
accounts. Each quarter the accountant will produce: (a) financial statements showing a summary of
sources and uses of funds, and uses by project activity; (b) procurement monitoring reports; and (c)
physical progress reports.
Couiinterpart CoimtrAb oim
Counterpart funds contribution has been a problem in the Malawi portfolio in the past. It was agreed that
prior to effectiveness US$220,000 will be deposited in a separate account to facilitate first year
implementation. The standard disbursement percentage categories have been concluded in Malawi, with
foreign consultancy expenditures be financed out of IDA funds at 100% and local expenditures at 80%.
AudAt Aririmgemesmts
Audit of Public Enterpnses which includes Government projects is the responsibility of the National
Audit Office (NAO). The NAO uses International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions
(INTOSAI) standards when carrying out its audits. Annual audits of the FIMTAP will be carried out by
the NAO or by an exteanal auditor suitable to the World Bank. The Terms of Reference for the annual
audit of the project which have been agreed upon will be included in the Project Implementation Manual
and will ensure that the audit will assess whether: a) the information is fairly presented for the specified
period and cumulatively for the period with regard to project accounts and statement of sources and
applications of funds; and b) reported disbursements were made in accordance with loan agreements and
the Project Appraisal Document.
Furthermore, statements of expenditure (SOE) will also be audited and the auditors will be required to
ascertain that individual expenditures which comprise SOE totals are fully supported by documentation
retained in the borrowers files, properly authorized and eligible under the DCA.



-49 -
Owing to the number of components, it shall also be a requirement that separate semi-annual audits be
carried out for purposes of checking on internal control, compliance with financial covenants, operation
of statements of expenditures and special account. These semi-annual audits will be carried out for
respective six month periods as agreed with the Association and audit reports will be furnished to the
Association no later than two months after the end of the relevant six month penod, as agreed with the
Association. The separate semi-annual audits may be carried out by NAO, or if it is jointly determined,
or shown, that NAO cannot carry out the separate semi-annual audits in a timely fashion, they may be
caried out by private auditors.
Special Account
The project will have one Special Account (SA) which will be opened through a commercial bank. This
account will be managed by the FIMTAP Secretariat. All requisite disbursement documentation whether
relating to reimbursement through statements of expenditures, direct payments, special account
replenishments, or special commitments documentation will be initiated and kept by the Secretariat. IDA
will be informed of the account opened in the commercial bank and will deposit funds with the account
once the project is effective. The size of the Special Account in the first year will be US$2,000,000.
In the first year, withdrawal application for reimbursement, direct payment instructions, and other
disbursement requests will originate from the office of the President and Cabinet (OPC) and be endorsed
by the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning (MOFEP) Claims Unit to the World Bank. Payment
instructions direct to suppliers will be sent through the same route through commercial banks as pursuant
to World Bank instructions.
Upon review and approval of submitted withdrawal applications, or payment instructions, the World
Bank's Treasury department will pay credit funds being reimbursed into the project's Special Account at
a commercial bank. Such funds will then be transferred from the Special Account. The bank where the
project account is maintained shall submit a letter of comfort on Bank funds from its headquarters to the
World Bank.
Upon receipt of such funds by the commercial bank from the World Bank through the Special Account,
the bank shall immediately notify the Ministry of Finance about the receipt. The Ministry of Finance
shall immediately issue a note called Credit Ceiling Authority (CCA) to the project's bank totaling the
sum received. The purpose of the note is to inform the local commercial bank that the project is allowed for
the penod to issue out cheques not exceeding the amount advised-pending receipt of some more funds
which would necessitate issuance of another credit limit increasing the limit for expenditure for the project.
Payments paid through the local account and all related documentation will be maintained by the FIMTAP
Secretariat for review by auditors and World Bank implementation support missions. Upon receipt of the
commercial bank statements, the project's financial accountant shall reconcile the accounts before
submitting the withdrawal application to the Ministry of Finance for onward transmission through the
commercial bank to the World Bank. When the project begins to implement report-based disbursements,
the procedure described under agreed reporting formats for report based documents shall apply.
The SA will be audited by an independent auditor acceptable to IDA which would be appointed prior to
Credit effectiveness based on an audit scope as contained in terms of reference acceptable to IDA. The
audited accounts will be submitted to the Bank six months after the end of each fiscal year from review.
