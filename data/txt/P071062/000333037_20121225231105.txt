F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The objective is to improve the quality of health services in a sustainable manner in order
to reduce maternal and child mortality. This will be achieved through (a) improvement of
maternal and child health services; (b) improved availability and quality of para-medical
personnel; (c) improved availability of drugs in health facilities; and (d) increased
capacity of the Government to implement and execute reforms. These activities should
set in place the initial conditions necessary for attaining Millennium Development Goals
in maternal and child health.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Country and Sector Background

1.1.1 Djibouti is a city state which in 2002 had a population of approximately 650,000,1
70 percent of whom lived around the capital city, and another 10 percent in other urban
centers. Given Djibouti's level of urbanization, its health system functions more like a
municipal/city-state system rather than a national system. Despite its relatively higher
nominal per capita income of US$780 (compared to an average of US$510 for sub-
Saharan Africa, US$320 for Yemen, and US$110 for Ethiopia), Djibouti had some of the
poorest social indicators in the world at the time of project preparation. The health
outcomes in Djibouti was very poor; endemic and infectious diseases were common and
on the rise. The major issues in the health sector were: (a) high death rates, particularly
maternal and child mortality rates; (b) increasing incidence rates of tuberculosis (TB),
HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases; (c) malaria endemic in the population; (d)
vaccination coverage was stagnating or declining; (e) a general lack of skills and shortage
of health personnel, particularly in remote health facilities; (f) chronic and sometimes
acute shortages of medicines and other consumables in health facilities; (g) poor sector
management, including lack of capacity to monitor and plan; and (h) ineffective hospital
management, because the heads of hospitals did not have discretionary authority over
staff or budget. Djibouti was spending 7 percent of its GDP on healthcare with little
apparent benefit. The general consensus within Djibouti, and among its development
partners, was that while highly endemic diseases (such as malaria, AIDS and TB) needed
immediate attention, vertical programmatic approach was likely to fail without
accompanying systemic reform.

Government Strategy

1.1.2 The Government proposed to address the underlying access and quality issues by:
(a) improving the technical quality of services offered in health facilities to increase
utilization in public health facilities; (b) launching national campaigns against AIDS, TB
and other infectious diseases; (c) starting a campaign against malaria; (d) reinvigorating
the vaccination campaign; (e) training more paramedics and improving their conditions
of service; (f) introducing cost-sharing and community pharmacies complemented by a
National Drug Fund to assure a long-term and sustainable supply of medicines; (g)
restructuring health system management by establishing a Directorate for Planning and
Information; and (h) providing administrative autonomy to major public health facilities.
The Government was quite aware that it needed to focus first on the key elements of
improving services (such as availability of medicines and better preventive care) to keep
public support strong for healthcare reforms. Thus, they were giving high priority to

  There were widely different population estimates; those discrepancies were resolved with the results of
the April 2009 census (population: 818,159).


                                                     1
addressing the drug supply question and resolving the issue of adequate and qualified
personnel in health centers.

1.1.3 To follow through, the Government developed a long-term strategic framework
(Plan Directeur) and a medium-term action plan (Plan d'Action). These plans were
shared with donors during a conference held in Djibouti from February 12 to 13, 2002.
IDA's support to the Government's program would be in two forms: an adaptable
program lending (APL) to support the Plan Directeur over the period of 2002 to 2015,
and a special HIV/AIDS control project. The APL would be implemented in three phases
with well defined triggers to move from one phase to another. The APL would address
issues of improving health services and targeting reductions in maternal and child
mortality as its overall objective. It would support investments to improve the quality of
services and support the long-term reforms necessary to assure that the gains from the
investments were sustainable. The parallel HIV/AIDS project would address issues of
HIV/AIDS, TB, other AIDS’ opportunistic infections, community-based care for AIDS
victims and their families, and female genital cutting.

Rationale for Bank Assistance

1.1.4 Country Assistance Strategy2 (CAS). The project would support the third CAS
objective of improving human development indicators by raising school enrollment,
improving access to health services, and containing the spread of infectious diseases such
as TB and HIV/AIDS, as well as improving access of the poor to basic services and
economic opportunities and targeting assistance to the most vulnerable.

1.1.5 Corporate and Regional Strategic Objectives. The Health Sector Development
Project (HSDP) APL would support actions designed to achieve the corporate goals,
mainly the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) for reductions in maternal and child
mortality and increase in immunization coverage. The project would also support two
major objectives of the MENA regional development strategy:              public sector
management and gender. Public sector management would be addressed through support
for reforms designed to improve health sector management. The principal objective of the
project includes improvement in women's health conditions, not only for those using
health facilities, but also, through community outreach programs, for those who, for
cultural reasons, do not use health facilities.

1.1.6 Project Rationale. An APL was chosen as the preferred instrument over a Specific
Investment Loan in view of the Government's commitment to long-term reform. The
World Bank's global experience in health sector reform would bring an important
element to the project design. The Bank group had supported health sector reforms
elsewhere in the region, e.g., Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Oman, Tunisia and
Yemen. It had also acquired significant sector reform experience in other regions of the
Bank.

1.1.7 Additional information on the context at appraisal is included in Annex 10.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

1.2.1 According to the Development Credit Agreement (DCA) dated August 12, 2002,
the original PDO was “to improve the quality of health services in the territory of the
Borrower.? The Project Appraisal Document (PAD) dated April 30, 2002 included a
more specific wording with reference to two MDGs (4 and 5), as follows: “The project
objective is to improve the quality of health services in a sustainable manner in order to
reduce maternal and child mortality. This will be achieved through (a) improvement of
maternal and child health services; (b) improved availability and quality of para-medical
personnel; (c) improved availability of medicines in health facilities; and (d) increased
capacity of the Government to implement and execute reforms. These activities should
set in place the initial conditions necessary for attaining MDG targets in maternal and
child mortality?.

1.2.2 According to the PAD, the project objectives would be monitored through the
following indicators: (a) increased use of health facilities; (b) higher proportion of births
in health facilities; (c) increased capacity of the Centre de Formation du Personnel de la
Santé (CFPS) to offer effective short and long-term training; (d) access to drugs in health
facilities; (e) operationalization of the drug fund; (f) agreement on autonomy for the
Peltier Hospital; and (g) setting up in MOH of a planning and health information
department.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

1.3.1 In connection with the additional financing of 2009, the PDO was expanded to
cover communicable diseases and made specifically linked to the three health-related
MDGs as follows: “The objective of the Project is to improve the quality of health
services in a sustainable manner in order to contribute to the progress towards achieving
the health-related Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) of reducing child and
maternal mortality and combating communicable diseases.?

1.3.2 As background, the targets for the health-related MDGs are as follows:

   i.   Target 4.A – Reduce by two-thirds, between 1990 and 2015, the under-five
        mortality rate.
 ii.    Target 5.A – Reduce by three-quarters, between 1990 and 2015, the maternal
        mortality ratio.
 iii.   Target 6.A – Have halted by 2015 and begun to reverse the spread of HIV/AIDS.
 iv.    Target 6.B – Achieve, by 2010, universal access to treatment for HIV/AIDS for
        all those who need it.
  v.    Target 6.C – Have halted by 2015 and begun to reverse the incidence of malaria
        and other major diseases.



                                             3
1.3.3 With the closing on September 30, 2008 of the IDA-financed HIV/AIDS, Malaria
and Tuberculosis Control Project (Cr. H0420), the Government requested that the Bank
continue its support to these programs aiming at combating communicable diseases,
which would contribute to MDG 6. Key indicators were added for HIV/AIDS prevalence,
TB and malaria. Under the original HSDP, the physical infrastructure had been rebuilt,
the management capacity had been strengthened, and the quality of services delivered
had been improved. Still, these interventions needed to be continued, and some of the
additional activities, such as the expansion of the nutrition interventions or the
strengthening of the referral system of obstetric emergencies at the Centre Médico-
hospitalier (CMH) level by replacing and equipping the ambulances, were critically
needed.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

1.4.1 The beneficiaries of the Project would be the users of Djibouti's health facilities,
particularly children and pregnant women, given the project’s priority for safe
motherhood and Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) activities. With the
2009 additional financing, those at risk from HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria would also
benefit. The availability of cheaper drugs through the Drug Fund and community
pharmacies would help not only to ensure the supply of essential medicines, but would
also provide lower cost medicine, increasing access to those who were unable to afford
the prevailing high prices of private pharmacies.

1.5 Original Components

1.5.1 The original project (phase I of the APL) consisted of four components:

Component A. Improve Health Services (US$5.0 million equivalent):
(i) improve the physical and human capacity of health facilities (Peltier Hospital and
urban dispensaries); (ii) support safe motherhood programs; (iii) support Integrated
Management of Childhood Illnesses (IMCI); (iv) reinforce malaria control efforts; and
(v) support immunization efforts.
Component B: Improve Availability and Quality of Human Resources (US$2.2 million
equivalent):
(i) expand capacity of the Centre de Formation du Personnel de la Santé (CFPS); (ii)
provide short-term courses; and (iii) improve service conditions for paramedical workers.
Component C: Improve Drug Supply (US$5.8 million equivalent):
(i) provide emergency supply of medicines and other medical consumables; (ii) train
Ministry of Health (MOH) personnel in drug stock management and helping to set up
community pharmacies; and (iii) support the establishment of a Drug Fund (Centrale
d'Achats des Médicaments et Matériaux Essentiels - CAMME).
Component D: Improve Sector Management (US$2.0 million equivalent). This will be
supported in five ways: (i) support the administrative autonomy for the Peltier Hospital;
(ii) support the capacity of the new Directorate of Studies, Planning and Donor
Coordination (Direction des Etudes, de la Planification et de la Coopération
Internationale - DEPCI); (iii) support the capacity of other technical directorates of the
MOH; (iv) support capacity building for operations and maintenance; and (iv) support the
                                            4
Credit Administration Unit – CAU, referred to by its French initials UGP - Unité de
Gestion des Projets.

1.5.2 A detailed project description is included in Annex 11.

1.6 Revised Components

1.6.1 The additional financing of 2009 included financing for Components A and D.
Original components B (improving availability and quality of health personnel) and C
(improving access and availability of drugs) were supported under component D in terms
of strengthening the management capacity of the Institut Supérieur des Sciences Sociales
(ISSS) and the Drug Fund (Centrale d'Achats des Médicaments et Matériels Essentiels,
CAMME).

1.6.2 The following additional activities were included under the original components A
and D:

Component A - Improving the Health Service Delivery Performance (US$3.6 million
equivalent). The additional financing will continue supporting the delivery of: (i) child
health services; (ii) maternal child health services; and (iii) prevention and treatment
services of HIV/AIDS and other prevalent communicable diseases.

Component D - Strengthening of Health Systems (US$3.4 million equivalent). This
component will continue financing activities aimed at strengthening the MOH
management capacity and improving the performance of the different health systems in
support of health services. This component will support the Unité de Gestion des Projets
(UGP) in managing project activities and fiduciary functions. The component will also
strengthen the program monitoring and evaluation and support demand creation
activities, such as social mobilization and community outreach.

1.7 Other significant changes

1.7.1 Additional Financing and Restructuring of Original Project. On June 22, 2009, an
additional financing (AF) of SDR 4.7 Million (US$7.0 million equivalent) in the form of
a grant changed the project scope and funding allocations (the additional financing
became effective on October 15, 2009). Since the AF package approved by the Board on
May 26, 2009 included a restructuring of the original project/credit, the Development
Credit Agreement (DCA) was amended on June 22, 2009. The amendment expanded the
project development objective (see Section 1.3 above) and extended the closing date for
the credit from June 30, 2009 to June 30, 2012 (that was the second extension of the
credit closing date), so that both the credit and the grant would have the same closing
date. The Financing Agreement of June 22, 2009 for the AF Grant was never amended;
there was no reallocation of the proceeds of the AF Grant and no postponement of the
closing date for the AF Grant.

1.7.2 Amendments of Development Credit Agreement (DCA). In addition to the
restructuring amendment, the DCA was amended five times, as follows:
                                            5
(1) Amendment of November 17, 2004 modifying and adding several procurement
procedures (national shopping for small works and direct contracting for goods) under
Schedule 3, Part C, and modifying the covenants under Article III “Execution of the
Project? (basically, postponing the dates for complying with the covenants).

(2) On May 15, 2008, the original closing date of June 30, 2008 was extended to June 30,
2009. The extension was necessary to provide sufficient time to complete the remaining
planned activities (including the surveys needed to validate and evaluate the performance
indicators) and to prepare the new phase of the Project.

(3) There were three reallocations of the proceeds of the original Credit, as follows:

                                                   In Special Drawing Rights (SDRs)

(5) Refunding of PPF                     200,000          108,362         65,598          65,598

1.7.3 In order for the Project to continue to implement the activities as planned, the
reallocations were necessary because of changes in the actual costs of works, goods and
services compared to the appraisal estimates. As shown in Annex 1 on “Project Costs and
Financing,? there were also changes in the distribution of the credit between the four
components, with some sizeable increases in the amounts for components A (Improve
Health services) and D (Improve Sector Management), a slight reduction in the amount
for component B (Improve Availability and Quality of Trained Personnel) and a sharp
decrease in the amount for component C (Improve Drug Supply). The shift regarding
drugs was not due to a reduction in the need for drugs (actually, Government continued to
purchase them with its own funds), but was related to the operational problems of
CAMME.

1.7.4 As per OP 13.20, the rule is that additional loans/grants must close within three
years of the closing date of the original project in effect when the additional financing is
extended. The project was thus closed in June 2012. The Client had requested an
extension and the decision by Bank management not to pursue a policy exception,
resulted in a “rush to contract? by MOH in the last few months before the closing date.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry



                                               6
2.1.1 In May 2001, a Bank identification mission found that the Government had
continued with the health sector reform agenda established with World Bank support
starting in 1993, even though World Bank support for the process was frozen between
1995 and 2001. Djibouti had completed the preliminary studies and developed them into
a national health sector development plan which the Government approved in 1998.
Several of the reforms, including restructuring of the MOH, hospital autonomy, etc., had
been passed into law, but the application decrees had yet to be issued. In the
pharmaceutical sector, the reforms had moved on with support from the French
Cooperation: an essential drugs list was approved and the process of setting up a drug
fund (CAMME) was moving forward. In general, the Government understood the need
for sector wide reforms to accompany any improvements in equipment and facilities.

2.1.2 However, some of the legal changes (e.g., hospital autonomy) had taken place
without necessary parallel reforms in sector financing. In addition, many of the disease
control programs were disorganized and ineffective, or were highly dependent on support
from the French Cooperation which was expected to end by the end of 2002. MOH's
management capacity remained weak and any reforms or other non-clinical activities
were dependent on a small core of people who were overloaded. Finally, there were
continuing difficulties with financing medicines and other consumables.

2.1.3 The HSDP was prepared with funding from a PHRD Grant from Japan of
US$404,294 and a Project Preparation Facility (PPF) of SDR 200,000 (US$250,000
equivalent). The project design benefitted from sound analytical work (CREDES Report
in six volumes), a Quality Enhancement Review (QER), as well as strong input from
country and sector management. The HSDP would address, inter alia, issues of low
utilization of the health services, shortage of qualified health personnel, shortage of
medicines, and poorly managed health facilities.

Assessment of project design

2.14 Choice of an APL. In view of the systemic problems in the health sector, an APL
was appropriate. The purpose of the program was to reduce maternal and child mortality
in line with the MDGs through increasing access to quality health services in a cost-
efficient manner. The program would be in three phases with the first phase to be focused
on improvement of service delivery while providing technical assistance for future
phases. The second phase would focus on improving efficiency and the third phase on
assuring that the improved services are sustainable. The triggers for initiating phases II
and III were appropriate.

2.1.5 Government’s strategic choice. The government’s strategic choice to start with
service improvement during Phase I (such as improving maternal and child health,
medicines and human resources) as a priority was the right choice. A sustained
improvement in health services would be important to mobilize public support for all
aspects of the reform. Also, given the high urban population (>80 percent) in a small
geographical area, the focus on improving health facility services was appropriate,
because geographical access (long distances) was not a major issue.

                                            7
2.1.6 Evaluation of the health system. The design of the HSDP was based on an extensive
evaluation of the health system conducted by the French consulting company CREDES
(Surveillance, lutte et prise en charge des problèmes majeurs de santé publique). While
this evaluation was constrained by limited quantitative data (e.g., epidemiological data,
unit costs, and budgets), it was able to sketch a detailed diagnosis of the major constraints
facing the health system and to outline strategic lines for reform. This economic analysis
addressed four issues: (i) the rationale for public involvement and likely welfare gains;
(ii) equity of public health expenditures; (iii) fiscal impacts of the project in terms of
recurrent costs; and (iv) financial and fiscal sustainability of the public health system
over the medium- and long-term.

2.1.7 Lessons learned and reflected in the project design. The project drew also on the
World Bank Group's global experience in health sector reform. The first important lesson
of health reform is that there should be immediate perceptible improvements in service
quality to maintain support for the reforms. A second important lesson is to bring all
parties with a vested interest on board during the planning and design phase. Another
lesson is that health reforms cannot take place without reforms in public expenditure
management3 as health is heavily dependent on public financing.

2.1.8 Coordination with donors. The project was prepared in close coordination with all
donors, culminating in the donors’ conference held in Djibouti in February 2002.

2.1.9 Training. The project would attempt to reinforce training within the country
through the strengthening of the national health training center (CFPS) and, without
sacrificing the quality of education, would promote training in Francophone Africa
(rather than Europe), thereby limiting the number of non-returnees from overseas
education programs.

2.1.10 Status of Preparation. There was no Operation or Implementation Manual, but the
PAD provided sufficient information on what had to be done to implement the
components, except for the drug fund component. The PAD stated that the CAMME
would buy drugs from the lowest-cost, quality sources and sell them to the public and
non-profit health establishments with a small mark-up to finance its operating costs.
However, there was no implementation manual for the establishment of CAMME.

2.1.11 Implementation arrangements. The MOH would implement the project through its
technical directorates. The unit within MOH responsible for managing donor-funded
projects was the Credit Administration Unit (CAU), referred to by its French initials UGP
- Unité de Gestion des Projets. It would handle procurement, disbursement, financial
management and project reporting functions. Project design included a satisfactory
monitoring and evaluation (M&E) framework.


3
 IDA was supporting these general public expenditure management reforms through the Technical
Assistance for Administrative Reform Project (PATARE) and through a Fiscal Consolidation Credit.


                                                  8
Government Commitment

2.1.12 The strength of the Government’s commitment and ownership was demonstrated
by the Djiboutian President who organized an open televised meeting on the health sector
where many key problems (which were to be addressed by the project) were raised. The
donors' meeting in February 2002 was opened by the Prime Minister who made an
unequivocal commitment to the sector and highlighted its importance. Various ministers,
members of parliament and other officials consistently highlighted the reforms as a
priority. The National Assembly had actually approved the health reform law which was
an essential pre-condition for reform.

Assessment of risks

2.1.13 In the PAD for the original project, the overall risk rating was “High,? because of
public sector management problems. The identified risks concerned the drug sector
reform (particularly the drug fund), the lack of incentives for health personnel, shortages
of counterpart funds, the provision of low level quality care, operations and maintenance
problems and the efficacy of outreach programs to reach mothers and children. Risk
mitigation measures included training, technical assistance, support to operations and
maintenance systems, and consultations and partnerships with community groups. For the
2009 AF, the overall risk rating was “Moderate.? The identified risks were similar to the
ones for the original project, but included also a reference to the weak management of
medical waste.

2.2 Implementation

2.2.1 The Project was implemented over a 10-year period during which the political
economy in Djibouti did not pose any risk above and beyond those that are encountered
during any project implementation. Despite the relatively favorable context, phases II and
III of the APL did not materialize, mainly because the amount of IDA funds allocated by
Government for Phase II was only US$2.0 million, deemed too low to justify the second
phase of the APL. Instead, in consultation with Government, Bank management decided
to carry on with Additional Financing (AF), a much simpler and faster instrument to
close that gap in financing and given the urgency to continue with Bank’s support to the
national communicable disease programs, particularly after the closing of the HIV/AIDS,
Tuberculosis and Malaria Control Project. While the AF was being processed, the
Government revised its priorities regarding the allocation of IDA funds among sectors
and increased the amount for AF for the health sector from US$2.0 million to US$7.0
million.

2.2.2 The main factor outside the control of Government or implementing agencies that
influenced project implementation and ultimately the project outcomes is the large influx
of immigrants from neighboring countries, which means an increased workload for health
facilities.




                                            9
2.2.3 The factors subject to Government control that influenced (either positively or
negatively) project implementation and ultimately the project outcomes can be
summarized as follows:
    a) The Government was committed to the project and the implementation of health
       sector reforms. MOH’s operating budget was regularly increased during the 10-
       year project period (an increase of about 155 percent between 2002 and 2011, and
       in 2011, the share of the national budget dedicated to health was 12 percent). In
       2004, Djibouti developed a Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) that
       identified an ambitious four-pronged strategy. Then in 2007, the President
       launched the “National Initiative for Social Development? (Initiative Nationale de
       Développement Social, INDS) in order to mitigate the social risks associated with
       the highly unequal economic development. The INDS has four pillars. The second
       pillar seeks to develop human resources and improve access to basic services,
       notably for women and youth. In particular, the aim is, inter alia, to improve the
       coverage and quality of healthcare. In March 2008, the MOH completed, with its
       own resources, the Second National Health Development Plan (Plan National de
       Développement de la Santé, PNDS II) for the period 2008 -2012.
    b) With the focus on maternal and child health, the selected approach of improving
       the availability and quality of health personnel 4 and of ensuring that drugs are
       available at reasonable prices had quite an impact on the health of the population.
       The availability and affordability of drugs were facilitated by the creation of
       community pharmacies which were a success. The introduction of mobile medical
       units5 was important to increase outreach, and the expanded program of
       vaccinations contributed to the improvement of child health.
    c) The Government was successful in its efforts to enlist other donors to finance the
       priorities that it had set for the health sector.
    d) The MOH, through its Project Management Unit (Unité de Gestion des Projets -
       UGP), managed the HSDP effectively. The UGP was staffed with competent and
       capable personnel. It should be noted that the key personnel (a Director, a
       Financial Management Officer, and a Procurement Officer) for the UGP were
       appointed in February 2002, well before the signing of the IDA Credit in August
       2002; an accountant and other support staff were appointed shortly thereafter.
    e) Despite the technical assistance provided under the Project, the establishment and
       operation of CAMME were fraught with difficulties during the entire
       implementation period. The agreement between MOH and CAMME was finalized
       only in 2007 and, for many years, CAMME’s board did not meet. There was a
       high turnover of staff, including the general manager. There were problems with
       the purchasing of medicines and with the keeping of accounts with delays in
       audits. To date, CAMME still does not have an accounting and financial manual.
       CAMME also suffered from delays in being reimbursed by the Ministry of

4
  With the increased budget, MOH was able to increase five-fold the number of nurses, mid-wives and lab
technicians to ensure the staffing and sustainability of the new health facilities.

5
 Consisting of one doctor, one mid-wife and one nurse, those mobile units were introduced with the
support of WHO, UNFPA and UNICEF.


                                                   10
         Finance (MOF) for drugs delivered to hospitals. The lack of adequate cash flow
         was a constant threat to the ability of the CAMME to ensure uninterrupted drug
         supply. However, despite all these problems, CAMME managed to make drugs
         available to health facilities; that is in itself quite an achievement.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

2.3.1 Design. According to the PAD, the project objectives would be monitored through
the following indicators: (a) increased use of health facilities; (b) higher proportion of
births in health facilities; (c) increased capacity of the CFPS to offer effective short and
long-term training; (d) access to drugs in health facilities; (e) operationalization of the
drug fund; (f) agreement on autonomy for the Peltier Hospital; and (g) setting up of a
planning and health information department. The PAD’s Annex 1 on “Project Design
Summary? included a few baseline and target values. It mentioned that a Population and
Family Health Survey would be carried out in 2002 (to establish baselines, in particular)
and that a follow-up survey was planned for 2015; this would allow measurement of
program impact on MDGs.

2.3.2 Implementation. At the beginning, progress towards the PDOs was monitored using
the original Project Results Framework and M&E indicators. The Pan-Arab Project for
Family Health - PAPFAM6 carried out a survey in 2002; the final report (Rapport Final
Enquête Djiboutienne sur la Santé Familiale 2002) issued in April 2004 provided up-to-
date baseline values for a number of indicators. When in 2009 the Bank developed a list
of IDA core indicators for the health sector, five core indicators7 were selected in
consultation with the Results Secretariat/OPCS and were also monitored. With the 2009
AF, based on the results of the 2006 Enquête Djiboutienne à Indicateurs Multiples –
EDIM (final report issued in December 2007), new targets were established for the
original indicators until the revised closing date. In addition, new indicators for
communicable diseases were added such as:8 (a) reduced prevalence of HIV/AIDS
among young pregnant women aged 15-24; (b) percentage of TB patients under treatment
cured within one year; and (c) number of insecticide-treated nets distributed to
households in high transmission areas. The Project relied on a considerably strengthened
Health Information System (HIS). Statistical yearbooks have been produced since 2007,
and each health unit receives a separate document with its own indicators. Also, a health
map (carte sanitaire) was prepared. Finally, user satisfaction and provider survey reports

6
  PAPFAM aims at improving family and reproductive health in Arab countries. To this end, surveys and
studies are conducted and accurate databases developed as necessary precursors for the implementation of
effective health policies and programs.

7
 (1) Number of pregnant women receiving antenatal care during a visit to a health provider. (2) Number of
health personnel receiving training. (3) Number of insecticides-treated bed nets distributed to households in
high transmission areas. (4) Number of health facilities constructed, renovated, and/or equipped. (5)
Number of children aged 12-24 months completely immunized before their first birthday.

8
  These indicators were monitored under the HAMTCP and were also supported by the Global Fund and
the AFD.


                                                     11
were carried out to assess progress. Key performance indicators, with their baseline and
end-of-project targets and values, are shown in the Project Data Sheet.

2.3.3 Utilization. The key performance indicators were closely monitored by the MOH.
Efforts were made to ensure that program managers were aware of the meaning and
importance of indicators. The M&E data is being used to inform decision-making and
resource allocation, as shown by the following examples: (i) nutrition statistics pointed
out the need for some nutrition programs, and nutrition activities were included in the
AF; (ii) the low utilization rate of many health facilities influenced the focus of the
follow on Bank-financed project (under preparation) on the improvement of access to and
utilization of quality healthcare services; (iii) health statistics and survey results are used
for the preparation of the medium term expenditure framework (Cadre des Dépenses à
Moyen Terme - CDMT); and (iv) data on population, area and burden of disease are
distribution keys for budget allocations.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Financial Management Arrangements

2.4.1 The financial management of the project was carried out by the newly established
UGP in MOH. The unit comprised financial management personnel. It produced financial
reports as required by IDA. It managed the Special/Designated Accounts (one for the
credit and one for the grant) opened at a commercial bank acceptable to IDA. Credit and
grant proceeds were disbursed based on traditional disbursement methods of Statement of
Expenditures (SOEs), Special/Designated Account replenishments and direct payments.

2.4.2 At appraisal, the financial management arrangements were not considered fully
satisfactory, therefore a detailed action plan was prepared to ensure compliance with the
Bank's financial safeguards. The plan included training of staff and the appointment of a
consulting firm to help design an accounting, internal control and reporting system and
procedures. At first, no proposals were received from consulting firms; the process had to
be repeated which delayed the due date for the installation of the system and the
development of the procedures manual.

2.4.3 Overall, financial management by the UGP was satisfactory. Accounting books and
records were properly maintained. There were, however, some shortcomings: (i) deficiencies
in control of expenditures and inventory; (ii) inefficient use of the computerized FM system; and
(iii) failure to implement, or delays in implementing the recommendations of Bank missions and
audit reports. Examples are the cases of ineligible expenditures (which had to be
reimbursed, and were corrected) and the very high cost of maintenance of the fleet of
vehicles. There were also delays in the preparation and submission of the Financial
Monitoring Reports (FMRs). The first audit report9 was submitted very late; subsequent
reports were submitted on time or with only slight delays.

9
 The first audit report was submitted very late because of delays in the appointment of the independent
external auditor although, according to the PAD, it should have been recruited by October 31, 2002.


                                                    12
2.4.4 Over most of the ten-year project period, financial management of the Project was
rated “moderately satisfactory? because of problems with the accounting and financial
management of CAMME, which is a separate legal entity. For many years, the accounts
were not properly kept, and CAMME had no Accounting and Financial Management
Manual. The first audit report covering the period 2003 to 2008 was produced only in
2009. There is a great need for technical assistance to strengthen CAMME’s financial
management.

2.4.5 Regarding the risks for the Bank of the fiduciary problems of CAMME, two things
are worth noting. First, the two main procurement of drugs for CAMME financed by the
IDA credit were processed by the UGP (and not by CAMME), and all proceeds of the
IDA credit and grant that were spent on component C (Improve Drug Supply) were
audited and found satisfactory as part of the general audit of the Project. Second, in view
of CAMME problems, the Bank refused to finance any more procurement of drugs for
CAMME (beyond the two procurement packages mentioned above) as long as its
problems were not resolved.

Procurement

2.4.6 At the time of appraisal, a Country Procurement Assessment Review had not yet
been carried out for Djibouti, but the experience with other projects in the country
indicated overall weak procurement capacity. The project was, therefore, considered a
high-risk project from the procurement point of view.

2.4.7 According to the PAD, the procurement officer in the UGP would be responsible
for preparing bidding documents and RFPs, in collaboration with the technical
departments of the MOH, which would be responsible for developing technical
specifications and terms of reference. Technical assistance would also be sought, if
needed. A Bank-approved standard bidding document for NCB, which was being used by
both the Agence Djiboutienne d’Exécution des Travaux d’Intérêt Public (ADETIP) and
education projects, would also be used by the UGP.

2.4.8 On November 17, 2004, the DCA was amended to modify and add several
procurement procedures under Schedule 3, Part C (Other Procurement Procedures):
adding shopping procedures for works, increasing the procurement thresholds through
United Nations agencies, and adding direct contracting for goods.

2.4.9 In general, the UGP procurement functions were carried out effectively. UGP staff
received training on procurement procedures. Procurement plans were prepared and
revised as necessary, and approved by the Bank. During supervision missions, the Bank’s
procurement staff conducted a posteriori procurement reviews. There were no cases of
misprocurement.

Environmental



                                            13
2.4.10 The environmental classification for this project was B (Partial Assessment) and
the only safeguard policy triggered was Environmental Assessment (OP/BP/GP 4.01).
The project would not induce direct impacts on the environment. However, the main
environmental issues were related to concerns with the management of medical solid and
liquid waste whose discharge into the environment without proper care or treatment can
cause outbreaks of infections as well as various types of other morbidities. Moreover, the
issue of risks of infection inside the hospital (so-called nosocomial infections) was also a
major concern. Finally, some rehabilitation/construction work would need to comply with
and be monitored according to appropriate environmental procedures aimed at mitigating
the nuisance that would be generated by the works.

2.4.11 In 2002, the Environmental Management Plan (EMP) was finalized and was
appropriately disclosed both in country and in the Bank's Infoshop. The EMP focused on
capacity building in order to improve the management of hospital waste and on the
promotion of good health-care practices in order to decrease the risk of secondary or
nosocomial infections. It also promoted the use of environmentally friendly ways to
protect the population at risk against malaria vectors; there would be no use of prohibited
pesticides, but only relatively innocuous pesticides (chemophos, deltamethrine) would be
used in fumigation campaigns during the mosquito season and as impregnation agents for
the mosquito bed nets. The EMP took into account the fact that this project was the first
phase of an APL, so the focus of the mitigating measures was on capacity building as
much as on actual impact mitigation. On the particular issue of hospital waste, the focus
on the Peltier Hospital would allow for testing of the feasibility of a waste management
plan and proper elimination of infectious waste through the new incinerator financed by
Spain.

2.4.12 In the early years of the Project, the lack of supervision of the environmental and
social aspects was problematic, but supervision missions in 2006, 2010 and 2011
included a safeguards specialist. Focal points for environment were appointed in health
facilities and in the UGP. As required by the EMP, an Environmental Impact Assessment
(EIA) of the incinerator operation at the Peltier Hospital was carried out, was approved
by the environment ministry and by the Bank, and was subsequently disclosed in the info
shop and in the country. With financing from the HIV/AIDS, Malaria and TB Control
Project, a consultant was recruited to review in early 2007 the operation and maintenance
as well as the location of the incinerator. The review confirmed that the operation of the
incinerator was not optimal,10 and that the incinerator should be moved to a more
appropriate location. Finally, Bank environmental procedures for civil works
implementation were not always respected. An EIA has been carried out for the new
Bank-financed health project under preparation; it assesses the existing medical waste
management and proposes mitigation measures, including the installation in a more
appropriate location of a modern incinerator for Djibouti-City, and training and capacity
building in environmental aspects.

10
  It did not always receive proper tune-up and maintenance, and it has been operating below optimum
temperature resulting in an incomplete combustion and emission into the air of biohazardous materials such
as dioxins.


                                                   14
2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

2.5.1 Building on the successes of the HSDP, a new Bank-financed health project is
under preparation. Its project development objective would be to improve the utilization
of quality healthcare services for maternal and child health and communicable disease
control programs (HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria). Bank financing is tentatively
estimated at US$7.0 million for three components. The first component would aim to
improve health service delivery performance. This component would finance healthcare
services by disbursing the financing proceeds to health providers based on specific
quantifiable outputs of the health facilities that are directly linked to the achievement of
the health-related MDGs, through a “Results-based Financing? (RBF) mechanism. That
mechanism gives health facilities financial rewards when they increase delivery of
essential services and improve quality. The second component would strengthen health
systems, including strengthening the MOH management capacity and improving the
performance of the different health systems in support of health services. The third
component would strengthen project management and monitoring and evaluation
capacity, including independent technical audits as well as health and client satisfaction
surveys to validate and verify the achievement of health facilities outputs.

2.5.2 During the financing gap between closure of the HSDP and effectiveness of the
proposed new project, the MOH is maintaining the critical health-related activities with
its own resources and through WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA and GAVI support.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.0 When assessing the project outcome, the Project and the role of the Bank have to be
placed in context. In Djibouti, the Bank is one actor among others in the health sector. As
shown in the small table at the end of Annex 1, during the project implementation period
the Islamic Development Bank and the African Development Bank as well as France and
Italy contributed substantial amounts of money to the health sector, which was also
supported by technical UN organizations, such as WHO, UNICEF, and UNFPA. The
Government provided about 55 percent of the resources for the health sector, and donors
contributed the remaining 45 percent. The Bank was the main donor, and it can be said
that the Bank’s participation in the sector encouraged the participation of other donors as
evidenced by the pledges of support during the February 2002 donors' conference. There
was good synergy between the various interventions; in particular, the facilities and
activities financed by other donors were complementary to the Bank support. Projects
financed by other donors certainly made some contribution to the favorable outcome of
the Bank-financed project. However, the Bank is the lead organization that established a
close partnership with Government on reforms and the steps that needed to be taken
(drugs, qualified personnel, and better management) in order to improve the health status
of the population. Within the context of this partnership, the Bank has been instrumental
in ensuring that the MOH’s reform agenda moved forward.

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
Rating: Highly Relevant

                                            15
3.1.1 The objectives, design and implementation of the Project were and remain highly
relevant to the Bank’s country assistance strategy (CAS) and to the current Djibouti
priorities. The CAS for 2009 -2012 (Report No. 47273-DJ, approved by the Board on
May 4, 2009) is based on Djibouti's National Initiative for Social Development (INDS).
The CAS is framed around three strategic themes aligned with the INDS: 1) supporting
growth; 2) supporting human development and access to basic services; and 3) supporting
governance and public sector management. Regarding human development, the CAS
states that the Bank will help Djibouti increase access to, and quality of, education and
health services, and strengthen social protection and direct support to poor people. The
Project is also consistent with the Second National Health Development Plan (Plan
National de Développement de la Santé - PNDS II) for the period 2008 -2012 that was
completed in March 2008.

3.1.2 The activities carried out under the Project are consistent with the CAS objective
and contributed specifically to the objective of improving the coverage and quality of
health care under pillar 2 of the INDS and theme 2 of the CAS. The focus of the project
design on the availability of drugs and of qualified personnel and on better sector
management was the right approach to achieve the objectives of the INDS and CAS.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

3.2.1 Annex 2 lists the outputs per component. Without underestimating the impact of the
financing provided by the Government and other donors, there is a clear linkage between
the Bank project outputs and outcomes. The HSDP was designed to address, inter alia,
issues of low utilization of the health services, shortage of qualified health personnel,
shortage of medicines, and poorly managed health facilities. Achievements regarding
these issues can be summarized as follows:

a) Low utilization of the health services. That issue has been addressed, as illustrated by
   use of metrics gauging the increase in the number of people making use of, or
   benefiting from services provided by health facilities as per below:

      By 2012, about 100,000 pregnant women had received two or more antenatal care
       visits to a health provider and, at 87 percent in 2012, the percentage of assisted
       births has more than doubled between 2002 and 2012. The Project contributed to
       the renovation and equipment of many health facilities, including clinics and
       maternity centers.
      At 93 percent in 2012, the proportion of children who are vaccinated with
       Diptheria Pertusis Tetanus (DPT3) before 12 months of age has about doubled
       between 2002 and 2012 and, in 2012, 18,300 children have been completely
       immunized before their first birthday. The project financed a survey of
       immunization coverage, the renovation of premises for the expanded program of
       immunization, and some elements of the cold chain.



                                            16
      The percentage of TB patients under treatment cured within one year increased
       from 62 percent in 2006 to 80 percent in 2012, a 29 percent increase. The project
       financed the strengthening of the capacity of the Paul Faure Hospital with the
       purchase of radiology equipment, and the training of service providers and
       community workers.
      The number of insecticide-treated bed nets distributed to households in high
       transmission areas increased from 2,000 in 2002 to 582,500 in 2012. The project
       financed some rapid diagnostic tests and the training of community health
       workers and volunteers.

b) Shortage of qualified health personnel. The project contributed significantly to the
   production and deployment of a skilled health workforce. The total number of
   students enrolled in the High Institute of Health Sciences (HIHS) reached 1,098 by
   2012. As a result, paramedical staff in health facilities increased four-fold between
   2002 and 2012; most health posts now have at least one midwife or nurse, compared
   to none in 2002. Also, a number of doctors received additional training in
   francophone countries and came back to Djibouti. The Project contributed to the
   renovation, expansion and equipment of the CFPS and ISSS, and financed some
   teachers and consultants for the upgrading of trainers. In addition to the improvement
   in services, the project was able to implement successfully important reforms to
   ensure that health facilities would be adequately staffed with qualified personnel: In
   accordance with legal covenants in the loan agreement: (i) job conditions to fully
   trained paramedics (with Diplômes d’Etat) were brought to a similar level as the
   Instituteurs with civil service status in the Ministry of Education; and (ii) qualified
   paramedics locating to remote areas became entitled to a hardship premium similar to
   that for teachers in remote areas.

c) Shortage of medicines. This issue was addressed with the establishment and operation
   of CAMME and community pharmacies. The CAMME was formally established and,
   despite the delays and shortcomings, became operational and made drugs and medical
   supplies available to health facilities and patients at reasonable prices, compared to
   the situation in 2002 when there were no drugs, or there were only expensive drugs in
   private pharmacies. The project provided US$3.2 million for the purchase of drugs,
   including some ARV drugs, and US$0.3 million for technical assistance to the
   CAMME.

d) Poorly managed health facilities. The Project financed the strengthening of the
   capacity of the Directorate of Studies, Planning and International Cooperation for
   planning and monitoring, as well as the capacity of the Health Information Service
   and the Directorate of Health Regions. Also, the Project provided US$1.7 million for
   surveys of the quality of health services, which helped to improve the management of
   health facilities. Finally, the Decree of July 1, 2009 gave administrative and financial
   autonomy to the Peltier Hospital. This was a major breakthrough for the
   implementation of the recommendations of the technical audit, conducted under the
   project, on the operational and financial aspects of the hospital.

3.2.2 The above-mentioned achievements explain why there have been significant
improvements in maternal and child mortality and in HIV/AIDS prevalence. The
maternal mortality ratio has been reduced from 546 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2002
to 383 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2012, a 30 percent reduction, and the under 5-
year old mortality rate has been reduced from 124 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2002 to
68 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2012, a 45 percent reduction. HIV/AIDS prevalence
among young pregnant women (15 to 24 years old) was reduced from 2.9% in 2002 to
1.4 % in 2010, a 52 percent reduction. Baseline values, targets and actual final results for
the three PDO Indicators are summarized in the table below.

3.2.3 Because the project was formerly restructured in 2009 (first order restructuring)
when the Additional Financing was approved, in accordance with the Bank ICR
Guidelines, the ICR should normally assess the project outcome “before? and “after?
restructuring (i.e., before and after 2009). Unfortunately, this cannot be done because
there are no reliable figures available for the values in 2009 of the three PDO indicators
and some intermediate outcome indicators. The only reliable values for these indicators
are the baseline values for 2002 and the end-of-project values for 2012, thanks to the two
PAPFAM surveys carried out in 2002 and 2012. This being said, however, in 2009, the
project was deemed to be on track to achieving its objectives in view of the positive
trends in improving key inputs (health workforce, availability of drugs) and outputs, i.e.,
access to essential healthcare services as documented above.

3.2.4 Djibouti’s overall progress in reaching the health-related MDG targets of 75 percent
reduction in MMR and 66 percent reduction in IMR by 2015 is deemed insufficient by
the UN, mainly as a result of total lack of progress between 1990 and 2000, the first
decade of the MDG initiative. Significant progress towards reaching these goals has been
made over the last decade, and as the data presented above attests, the project itself has
played a major role in contributing significantly to “narrowing the gap? between what the
situation was in 2002 and how closer the country is in 2012 toward reaching these
objectives.




                                            18
3.2.5 Overall, the achievement of the PDO is rated “Satisfactory? given the significant
contributions by the project to improved health service delivery and use in Djibouti over
the last ten years.

3.3 Efficiency
Rating: Satisfactory

3.3.1 No a posteriori economic evaluation of the Project has been carried out. However,
the findings of the economic and financial analysis, carried out in 2002 for the appraisal
of the original project and updated in 2009 for the AF, remain valid. That analysis is
summarized in Annex 3. It addressed the following four issues:
(i) the rationale for public involvement and likely welfare gains - given the high child and
maternal mortality rates, the marginal benefits of project interventions are considerably
higher than the marginal costs.
(ii) equity of public health expenditures - by rationalizing the allocation of public
expenditures across levels and regions, the project improved equity.
(iii) fiscal impact of the project in terms of recurrent costs - the project recurrent costs
have been accommodated by the health budget which has steadily increased in recent
years.
(iv) financial and fiscal sustainability of the public health system over the medium and
long-term until 2012 – meeting future demands for public health services would require
continuous efforts to contain and reduce costs, as has been done with the procurement of
drugs and medical supplies.

3.3.2 The project supported the creation of CAMME to replace PHARMAPRO which
had many problems and limitations. The main objective of CAMME was to acquire
quality essential generic drugs for distribution to public health facilities. One important
benefit of the Project was the sharp reduction in the cost of drugs made available to
health facilities and to the population. In comparison with that benefit, the costs involved
were reasonable, so that one can conclude that Djibouti received “good value for the
money.? CAMME was able to reduce its prices to health facilities by percentages varying
between 3 percent and 52 percent, depending on the products. With regards to the
comparison with private pharmacies, the reduction in unit prices is tremendous (up to 96
percent in some cases) because CAMME was able to purchase and supply drugs in large
quantities (1,000 units per box) as opposed to boxes of 30, 20 or even only 14 units sold
by private pharmacies.

3.3.3 Procurement of other goods and implementation of other activities financed under
the Project were cost efficient. Drugs were purchased through International Competitive
Bidding (ICB), and some other purchases were through UN Agencies, such as UNICEF
for the cold chain and bed nets. Construction was also cost efficient following
competitive bidding, based on the Bank’s procurement guidelines.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory



                                              19
3.4.1 The assessment of the three criteria for overall outcome rating can be summarized
as follows: (i) the HSDP’s objectives, design and implementation were and remain highly
relevant to current country priorities and the CAS; (ii) the achievement of the PDO is
rated “Satisfactory? because over the last ten years the Project certainly “ contributed to
the progress towards achieving the MDGs;? and (iii) regarding efficiency, with the
Project, Djibouti received good value for money. Based on these assessments, the overall
outcome is rated “Satisfactory.?

3.4.2 Although implementation was somewhat slow at the beginning, the Project
progressed smoothly and results were consistent with the outcomes reflected in the
appraisal documents for the credit and the grant. The success of the Project and the
satisfactory outcome are the result of a favorable combination of factors:

(1) First, thanks to the Project, drugs have generally been available to the population,
either free or at prices that they could afford.
(2) Second, health facilities have been by and large staffed with qualified personnel.
Project support was a good complement to the Government commitment to finance the
operation of the ISSS. An increasing number of paramedic graduates have been offered
employment by MOH and have been willing to work in health facilities because of the
rather good employment conditions. Civil servant salaries are competitive, which ensures
recruitment of talented staff. Employment conditions were improved when Government
complied with the covenants in the DCA regarding job conditions for fully trained
paramedics and the payment of a hardship premium for qualified paramedics locating in
remote areas.
(3) Third, the Project supported improvements in sector management, including the
MOH’s capacity to monitor health conditions and the reform.
(4) Fourth, the MOH’s UGP managed the HSDP effectively.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

3.5.1 The project benefitted the wider Djiboutian population by improving the quality of
healthcare services and the availability of drugs. Its focus on improving maternal and
infant health was of particular interest to women and benefitted primarily the poor.
Djibouti has an extremely high incidence of poverty as reflected by the 42 percent
absolute and 75 percent relative poverty rates. It is estimated that the poor constitute
about 40 percent of the urban population and 60 percent of the rural population. Most of
the project service delivery interventions (under Component A) were limited to the
primary and secondary health facility levels in rural and peri-urban areas, which are
mostly utilized by the poor (more than three-quarters of users of health posts are
considered poor). Rural households in particular are at a great disadvantage as there are
no private pharmacies outside of Djibouti-City. In the absence of drugs at the public
healthcare facility, patients must purchase them in Djibouti-City, incurring prohibitive
costs. The project made drugs widely available at affordable costs, thanks to the
operation of CAMME and the establishment of community-based pharmacies.


                                            20
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

3.5.2 The Project supported the restructuring of the health system across the board. This
included: (i) support for managing the sector; (ii) establishing the CAMME and
community pharmacies to supply drugs at affordable prices on a sustainable basis; (iii)
changing service conditions for paramedics so that more are attracted to the jobs
including in remote areas; and (iv) supporting the autonomy of the main hospital.

3.5.3 The project was implemented by the MOH through its directorates and its UGP.
Over the past ten years, UGP’s capacity has been gradually built to implement
development projects; it has managed effectively the HSDP as well as other donor-
supported projects. Also, with project’s support, MOH’s Directorates have developed
their management and institutional capacity.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
None

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

3.6.1 Two User Satisfaction and Provider Surveys were carried out during the life of the
Project. According to the surveys, there were improvements in several areas; most of
these improvements were observed at the CMH (district hospital) level, which was
supported almost exclusively by the Project. At the CMH (district hospital) level, user
satisfaction increased by an average of 4.1 points in 2008, compared to 2.97 points in
2005. At the general hospital and the CMH levels, the improvements were mainly in the
areas of: security, cleanliness, comfort, access to drugs and increase in personnel. Also,
the second survey included feedback from the providers, for the first time, to assess their
perceptions on the improvements in the work environment and the sector.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Significant

4.1 The risk to development outcome (i.e., the risk that development outcomes will not be
maintained) is assessed as “Significant.?

4.2 To date, the Government has shown a strong commitment to project objectives and
has regularly increased the budget for health. There is no reason to believe that the
Government commitment will not be maintained. However, during the project period,
Government had great difficulties reimbursing the CAMME for the costs of the drugs
made available to health facilities. With new hospitals and other health facilities
becoming operational, the operation and maintenance budget will have to be increased.
Further, meeting future demands for public health services, including an effective pro-
poor health service delivery, while improving quality would also require additional
resources. This will be quite a challenge for the Government, particularly considering the
high level of poverty in the country.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory

5.1.1 As discussed in Section 2.1 on “Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry,?
the project design was satisfactory. The choice of an APL was appropriate; Government
had made the right strategic choice; the design was based on a detailed evaluation of the
health system, took into account lessons learned from other projects and included a
satisfactory M&E framework; and, with the exception of the drug fund component, the
project was well prepared and preparation had been done in close coordination with all
donors. With respect to the drug fund, there was no detailed implementation manual.
Presumably, that was to be done as part of project implementation. If it were not for that
shortcoming, the Bank performance for quality at entry would deserve a rating of “Highly
Satisfactory.?

5.1.2 The satisfactory performance is due in great part to the very good skill mix of the
Bank task team during preparation and appraisal. Under the leadership of an experienced
and talented TTL, the team included a health specialist, a health economist, an FM
specialist, an HR economist, an environmental specialist and social scientist, as well as
strong input from an implementation specialist. Yet, at US$227,000, the lending cost to
the Bank budget was not excessive. The time required for preparation and appraisal were
appropriate (11 months). Management inputs were also effective and timely.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

5.1.3 The Bank’s supervision performance is rated “Satisfactory.?

5.1.4 Bank task team continuity has been good despite a long implementation period of
ten years. Good use has been made of trust funds (e.g., to mobilize expert advice for
nutrition and for health systems), so that the Bank supervision budget was reasonable
(US$870,000 in total, or US$83,000 per year on average). Skill mix has been good,
including a pharmaceuticals expert. The task team has been proactive in identifying
issues and taking appropriate action. ISRs and Aide-memoires provided a consistent and
realistic picture of project implementation. Sector managers made good and substantive
comments on ISRs throughout implementation. ISRs highlighted issues that required
management attention, and sector and country management responses to Government
were made on time. The Country Management Unit (CMU) was supportive on major
issues such as the drug fund, and on the IDA allocation for the additional financing.

5.1.5 The Bank supervised the environmental aspects of the Project. Progress was made
in some areas (i.e., separation of medical waste from non-medical waste) but the main
problem is the incinerator at the Peltier Hospital, and that problem has not been solved.
The Bank did a good job in supervising and providing implementation support for
procurement and financial management.

                                           22
5.1.6 Bank management and staff spent much time and effort to ensure that MOF
reimbursed the CAMME for the drugs and medical supplies that were delivered to the
MOH facilities. Obviously, this was and still is a very important issue. Finally, there is
now a line item for drugs in the MOH’s budget. The Bank was right to withhold further
support to the CAMME until progress is made on some important management issues.

5.1.7 The Mid-Term Review in January 2007 confirmed that the Project’s progress was
satisfactory and that most of the objectives were likely to be met. The review did not
recommend any major changes in the Project.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

5.1.8 Since the ratings for both quality at entry and supervision are satisfactory, the
Overall Bank Performance is also rated satisfactory. The good quality at entry, as well as
the close supervision and implementation support provided by Bank staff from
headquarters and from the Cairo office, contributed to the success of the Project.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.2.1 The Government performance is rated “Moderately Satisfactory.? There were many
positive aspects of the Government involvement with the Project: strong commitment,
including at the President’s level; strong ownership of the design process; and regular
increases in the operating budget of the MOH. On the other hand, several issues, such as
the Peltier Hospital autonomy and the issuance of the Presidential decree increasing the
salaries and benefits of qualified paramedics serving in rural areas, dragged on for
unreasonably long periods. Also, insufficient attention was given to environmental issues.
In addition, a major problem was the arrears on drugs that endangered the achievement
and the sustainability of a whole project component. The funding was delayed due to the
MOF inability to provide the counterpart funding in a timely manner. This was a
recurring issue which was always “resolved? temporarily, and only after considerable
inputs from the Minister of Health, the task team, and direct involvement from the CMU.
At least, there is now a line for drugs in the MOH budget.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Highly Satisfactory

5.2.2 The performance of MOH11 in implementing the Project is rated “Highly
Satisfactory.?


11
  MOH is also the Government, but its performance is being reviewed here as the
implementing ministry.


                                            23
5.2.3 MOH relied on its UGP to manage the Project and implemented it through its
concerned technical directorates and health facilities. The ISSS, which is financed by
Government but received some inputs from the HSDP, is now part of the Ministère de
l’Enseignement Supérieur et de la Recherche, and the CAMME is a not-for-profit
association distinct from the MOH.

5.2.4 Over the last ten years, MOH performed extremely well both at the design stage and
during project implementation. Reforming the health sector while expanding and
improving the quality of health services was no small feat. MOH and the UGP had to
manage other donor-funded projects in addition to the HSDP. Results speak for
themselves: reforms have been carried out and, with the availability of drugs and
qualified paramedics, there have been reductions in mortality ratios and [subject to
confirmation] HIV/AIDS prevalence. The Minister of Health was always very much
involved personally to ensure that the MOF reimbursed CAMME for the costs of drugs.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

5.2.5 With the Government performance rated “Moderately Satisfactory? and the
Implementing Agency performance rated “Highly Satisfactory,? the Borrower
performance is rated “Satisfactory.?

6. Lessons Learned

(i) A strong commitment by Government to support the improvement of health
services is crucial to ensure the success of a health project. This commitment was
concretized by a rigorous follow-up of project implementation and by a significant
increase in the operating budget of the MOH.
(ii) When the health sector is being financed by Government and by several donors,
it is important to ensure that these different interventions complement each other,
without duplication of efforts. There was a good synergy between the Bank financing
and the financing provided by other donors. Bank financing respected the country’s
priorities and was a catalyst to attract other donor financing.
(iii) Health services cannot have a favorable and sustainable impact on the
population if there are no drugs and if the medical personnel are not qualified and
motivated to perform their services. With the project, drugs have been available at
affordable prices, and there have been improvements in the availability and qualifications
of medical personnel. The introduction of mobile units with the support of WHO,
UNFPA and UNICEF is a success story of the Project.
(iv) A functional Health Management Information System (HMIS) is important for
a project that aims to reduce maternal and child mortality. The M&E data is being
used to inform decision-making and resource allocation. The significance of
strengthening the routine HMIS system cannot be overemphasized.
(v) The establishment and operation of a drug fund must be carefully prepared with
an implementation manual covering all aspects, from the list of essential generic
drugs, the procurement strategy, and the system for drug deliveries and for managing

                                           24
inventories, to the keeping of accounts and financial management including mechanisms
to ensure financial viability.

Notes: The Bank’s PAD dated April 30, 2002 showed total project costs and financing of
US$30.0 million which included, in addition to the IDA Credit of US$15.0 million,
financing by the Borrower (US$2.0 million), the Islamic Development Bank (US$5.0
million), France (US$3.0 million) and Saudi Arabia (US$5.0 million).

However, when the Development Credit Agreement (DCA) was signed on August 12,
2002 the Bank had agreed to finance 100 percent of expenditures, so that a contribution
by the Borrower was no longer required. Also, the DCA did not include any reference to
co financiers. In practice, several donors financed MOH’s activities under separate
arrangements, independent from IDA financing. The main support provided by donors
between 2002 and 2012 is shown in the table below.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

Analysis of the Ongoing Project Completed in 2009 for the Additional Financing

The economic analysis of the ongoing project addressed the following four issues: (i) the
rationale for public involvement and likely welfare gains; (ii) equity of public health
expenditures; (iii) fiscal impact of the project in terms of recurrent costs; and (iv)
financial and fiscal sustainability of the public health system over the medium and long-
term until 2012. The key conclusions are as follows:

Rationale for public involvement and expected welfare gains. There are ample
opportunities to generate welfare gains through a more efficient provision of public goods
and by supporting the demand for services with high social externalities. The core of the
project aims at introducing institutional reforms to correct current failures in the public
health delivery and financing systems. The project will initially focus on interventions to
reverse alarming trends in infant and maternal mortality rates, by reducing constraints in
terms of access to medical inputs, improving services delivery, and by strengthening the
treatment of child diseases and pre-natal care. Given the high child and maternal
mortality rates, the marginal benefits of these interventions are expected to be
considerably higher than the marginal costs. Exploratory analysis shows, for instance,
that even under conservative assumptions about the impact of the project on infant and
maternal mortality rates (half of the reductions required to meet the Millennium
Development Goals), the project would generate social gains that are twice as high as the
original investment. Over the medium-term, the project will also support activities to
improve technical and allocative efficiency at large, by reforming current management
and institutional arrangements, reviewing budgetary practices, strengthening human
resources management, and rationalizing the procurement of drugs and medical inputs.

Improving equity. The current project can also be justified on equity grounds. Current
public expenditures are biased towards the non-poor. Indeed, the poor use mostly
dispensaries, while hospitals are mainly used by the non-poor. Yet, the highest share of
the budget is allocated to the operation of hospitals. Thus, the poorest 40 percent of the
population receive only 22 percent of public expenditures. The richest 20 percent of the
population, on the other hand, benefit from 29 percent of these expenditures.
Expenditures on dispensaries are more or less distributed equitably between regions. The
5.8 percent of the population living in rural areas receive 5.9 percent of the subsidies,
while the 11.5 percent living in towns other than the capital capture 11.9 percent. The
distribution of hospital expenditures, on the other hand, is biased towards urban
populations. Rural populations receive 1.7 percent of these expenditures, while the
population living in the city of Djibouti (82.7 percent) receive 94 percent of the total
expenditures. The remainder 4.3 percent of expenditures goes to the other cities. By
reviewing financial mechanisms, restoring the health pyramid, and rationalizing the
allocation of public expenditures across levels and regions, the project is expected to
improve equity.




                                            34
Recurrent costs and fiscal impacts. The costs of the different project components and
interventions have been evaluated in detail. The results show that the recurrent costs
associated with the planned investment will reach 0.04 percent of GDP per year, 0.11
percent of current government revenues, or 1 percent of current public health
expenditures (these account for 4 percent of GDP including donors support). The current
program to reinforce the management of public expenditures that the Government had put
together, with the support of the International Monetary Fund and the Bank, is expected
to liberate resources for the social sectors. It is therefore expected that the recurrent costs
of the project can be accommodated by the health budget. Actually, the increase in the
health budget in recent years (2005-2007) reflects a steady increase in recurrent costs to
support the investments in the health sector as well as the increase in salaries and
incentives of paramedical staff required in the project.

Medium and long-term financial sustainability of the public health system. While the
recurrent costs of the project are expected to have only a marginal impact on the public
health budget, meeting future demands for public health services while improving quality
may require additional resources. Clearly, there are still efficiency gains to be realized by
reducing input costs (e.g., the rationalization of the procurement of medicines and
medical supplies by changing the input mix in a way that the same level of services can
be provided at lower total costs). Under alternative scenarios, simulations of future
demands for public health services suggest that a financing gap could build up over time,
reaching 1 percent to 2 percent of GDP in the year 2015. This does not imply necessarily
that the Government needs to increase public health expenditures by this much. It does
imply, however, that current financing mechanisms need to be reviewed: first, to
rationalize this demand and provide continuous incentives to contain and reduce costs;
and second, to achieve a better mix between public and private resources.

Two User Satisfaction and Provider Surveys were carried out during the life of the
Project. According to the surveys, there were improvements in several areas; most of
these improvements were observed at the CMH (district hospital) level, which was
supported almost exclusively by the Project. At the CMH (district hospital) level, user
satisfaction increased by an average of 4.1 points in 2008, compared to 2.97 points in
2005. At the general hospital and the CMH levels, the improvements were mainly in the
areas of: security, cleanliness, comfort, access to drugs and increase in personnel. Also,
the second survey included feedback from the providers, for the first time, to assess their
perceptions on the improvements in the work environment and the sector.

A. Analyse de la pertinence des objectifs et du calendrier du projet

Le but du programme était d’appuyer le développement à long terme du secteur
djiboutien de la santé en vue d’atteindre les cibles des Objectifs de développement pour
le millénaire (ODM) de réduction (a) du taux de mortalité des enfants de moins de cinq
ans (de 200 pour 1.000 naissances vivantes en 1990 à 70 pour 1.000 d’ici 2015) ; et (b)
du taux de mortalité maternelle (de 740 pour 100.000 naissances vivantes en 1990 à 250
d’ici 2015).
Dans cette perspective le Gouvernement a préparé un Plan Nationale de Développement
de la Secteur de la Santé à long terme et un plan d’action à moyen terme pour une
reforme structurelle du secteur de la santé. Les mesures prévues dans ces cadres
stratégiques allaient de l’amélioration des infrastructures et services de santé à de vastes
réformes de la gestion ciblant l’approvisionnement pharmaceutique et la gestion des
structures de santé fortement impactés par la politique d’ajustement structurel proposée
au pays. L’institutionnalisation du principe de partage des coûts avec les bénéficiaires
mené sous forme de projet pilote était également au menu de ces plans.
Le présent projet financé par la Banque Mondiale pour la mise en œuvre des plans du
Gouvernement s’est fait à deux niveaux pour un meilleur effet synergique : dans le cadre
d’un Prêt-programme évolutif (PPE) à l’appui du Plan Nationale de Développement du
Secteur de la Santé 2002 à 2015 et un projet spécifique de lutte contre le VIH/SIDA. Le
PPE a ciblé les questions relatives à l’amélioration des services de santé avec pour
principal objectif la réduction des taux de mortalité maternelle et infantile, l’appui aux
investissements visant à améliorer la qualité des services et aux réformes à long terme
nécessaires pour garantir la pérennité des gains dérivés des investissements. Le projet
parallèle de lutte contre le VIH/SIDA a complété le dispositif en abordant les questions
liées au VIH/SIDA, TB et autres infections opportunistes du SIDA, aux soins
communautaires des victimes du SIDA et leurs familles, et à la mutilation génitale des
femmes.
Conforment au plan initiale le PPE a été exécuté en trois phases. La Phase I qui s’est
déroulée de 2002 à 2007 en mettant l’accent sur (a) l’amélioration des soins de santé

                                            40
maternelle et infantile, y compris de meilleures pratiques de gestion ; (b) l’amélioration
de l’accès aux médicaments ; (c) la valorisation des ressources humaines ; et (d) le
renforcement de la capacité du Ministère de la Santé à développer, exécuter et assurer le
suivi des réformes. La Phase II qui s’est déroulée de 2006 à 2010 en aidant à consolider
les gains des investissements consentis dans le cadre de la première phase d’amélioration
des structures de santé, de l’approvisionnement pharmaceutique et de la valorisation des
ressources humaines et à orienter le système dans la voie de la pérennité. La Phase III à
partir de 2009 a appuyé les reformes nécessaires pour assurer la pérennité à long terme
des gains retirés des Phases I et II.
On peut valablement considérer que les objectifs et les approches adoptés par le projet
ont été en adéquation avec le contexte qui prévalait à l’époque où pour la première fois
Djibouti a connu sa première politique d’ajustement structurelle et une crise des finances
publiques qui a montré les limites de l’état providence jusqu’à là porté par la France et
d’autre amis du Golfe. En dépit de son revenu nominal par habitant relativement élevé de
780 $, les indicateurs sociaux de Djibouti étaient parmi les plus faibles au monde avec
des maladies endémiques et infectieuses à la hausse VIH/SIDA, maladies sexuellement
transmissibles (MST), le paludisme et la tuberculose (TB).
La dégradation des structures et des services de santé conséquence démotivation du
personnel non régulièrement payé et les difficultés d’approvisionnement. Le
Gouvernement devait relever le défit posé développement de l’infrastructure sanitaire
(humaine et matérielle), les programmes de lutte contre les maladies, et trouver des
systèmes de financement pérennes et accroître l’efficacité, l’équité, et la qualité du
secteur de la santé.
Ces constats et les plans proposés ont été largement discutés dans le pays et ont obtenu
l’aval du Gouvernement et de la société civile. Ils ont été communiqués aux bailleurs de
fonds dans le cadre d’une conférence qui s’est tenue à Djibouti les 12 et 13 février 2002.
Le calendrier et les différentes phases assignées ont été aussi pertinents car les reformes
proposés devaient s’attaquer à certains domaines prioritaires tout en laissant le temps
nécessaire à la mise à niveau des infrastructures et la formation du personnel et le
développement des ressources humaines qui devaient combler le vide laissé par le retrait
de la coopération française. La progressivité du calendrier retenu à permis à l’ensemble
des parties prenants à absorber et adhérer à la reforme du système.
Les objectifs du projet qui sont très clairement en phase avec les priorités ont été
analysés, discutés et maitrisés. Les résultants obtenus sont aussi pour une certaine part
facilités par l’ampleur de la crise systémique du secteur et les faiblesses d’ordre
structurelle de tous ordres qui caractérisaient la période d’entame du projet.

B. Résultats du projet

Les objectifs directes assignés au projet ont été incontestablement atteints voire dépassés
pour certain d’entre eux. Le projet « Programme de Développement du Secteur de la
Santé (PDSS) » a été l’élément central de la reforme du secteur proposée par le
gouvernement et a permis un changement en profondeur du système de santé à Djibouti.
Fortement relié au cadre stratégique ou Plan de National de Développement de Santé,
l’objectif du projet est d’améliorer la qualité des services de santé d’une manière durable
afin de réduire la mortalité maternelle et infantile en :

                                            41
        (a) améliorant les services de santé maternelle et infantile ;
        (b) améliorant la disponibilité et la qualité du personnel paramédical ;
        (c) améliorant la disponibilité des médicaments dans les établissements de santé ;
        (d) renforçant la capacité du Gouvernement à exécuter les réformes.
La réalisation d’ensemble des ces effets sur le système de santé a permis de mettre en
place les conditions initiales dans un premier temps et à atteindre les cibles des ODM en
matière de mortalité maternelle et infantile en une décennie.

   1) Evaluation de l’impact du projet

L’objectif principal ou objectif programme à atteindre a été défini comme la réduction
des taux de mortalités maternelle et infantile selon le calendrier fixé dans le cadre du
programme global des ODM grâce à un accès accru à des services de santé de qualité et
selon un bon rapport coût/efficacité. Le programme a été déployé en trois phases logiques
avec une première consacrée à l’amélioration de la prestation des services tout en
assurant l’assistance technique pour les phases subséquentes. La deuxième phase a porté
sur l’amélioration de l’efficacité et la troisième a permis d’assurer la pérennité des
améliorations apportées aux services.
On peut considérer que cet objectif est pleinement atteint car l’indicateur de résultats
programme pour la mortalité maternelle est passé de 740 en 1990 à moins de 250 décès
maternelles pour 100.000 accouchements (solide estimation) et cela avant le terme 2015
fixé par le ODM. IL convient de noter cependant que les sources de données sur la
mortalité maternelle sont des sources indirectes. La mortalité maternelle intra hospitalière
considérée pour le cas de Djibouti comme un indicateur valide selon une note technique (
source) est de 385 décès maternels pour 100 000 naissances en 2006, 196 en 2008 et 118
pour 2009. D’autre part, le taux de mortalité infanto juvénile est passé de 124 en 2002 à
94 pour 1000 naissances vivantes (EDIM 2006). Le taux de mortalité infantile est réduit
de 103 en 2002 à 67 pour 1000 naissances vivantes (EDIM 2006). La non réalisation des
enquêtes PAPFAM et EDIM prévues n’ont malheureusement pu être réalisées dans le
délai pour confirmer définitivement les progrès enregistrés à la fin du PDSS.

Cet objectif prioritaire a été supporté par la réalisation des objectifs des composantes du
projet/programme. Les indicateurs des résultats assignés à ces différentes composantes
sont également tous atteint comme le montre le tableau des indicateurs de performance de
l’annexe 1. Il convient de préciser que les indicateurs retenus de indicateurs plutôt
d’impact et de ce fait peuvent ne pas être les fruits exclusifs du présent projet mais la
bonne réalisation des objectifs des composantes parfois au-delà des prévisions conforte le
fait que l’impact des réalisations du PDSS occupent une place centrale dans la
modernisation des indicateurs du secteur et les progrès réalisés depuis 2002.

On notera que la notion de coût efficacité est reprise au niveau du but du programme sans
que l’on ait retenu des indicateurs spécifiques pour l’évaluation.

Par contre la qualité des services a bien été prise en compte et a été mesurer à travers
deux enquête qualité (Rapport et résultats non encore en notre possession)
e

                                            42
   2) Réalisation du projet par composante

Les données et rapports disponibles y compris le dernier l’annuaire statistiques du
Ministère de la santé 2011 montrent incontestablement que les résultats des indicateurs
des performances sont tous atteint parfois au delà de ce qui était attendu et que les
investissements sont bien faits même s’ils l’ont été parfois avec retard.
Les composantes au nombre de quatre ont été regroupé en deux avec une composante
amélioration de la performance du système et une autre de renforcement du système de
santé.

Composante 1 : Amélioration de la performance des services de santé:
Les activités financées sous cette composante apportent un appui aux prestations des
services de (i) santé infantile tels que le PEV, la PCIME et le traitement de la
malnutrition ; (ii) santé maternelle et néonatale tels que les services périnataux,
accouchement assisté par du personnel qualifié, et les soins obstétricaux et néonataux
d’urgence (SONUB et SONUC) ; et (iii) CDV et DOTS pour la lutte contre le VIH/SIDA
et les maladies transmissibles majeures (Tuberculose et Paludisme). Cette composante
couvre les activités des services et programmes suivants :
     o Direction de la Santé de la Mère et de l’Enfant (DSME)
     o Programme Elargi de Vaccination (PEV)
     o Programme de lutte contre le VIH/SIDA au Ministère de la Santé (PLSS)
     o Programme National de Lutte contre la Tuberculose (PNLT)
     o Programme National de Lutte contre le Paludisme (PNLP)

Les résultats de cette composante peuvent être jugés comme excellents si l’on considère
évolution des indicateurs retenus.
Le taux de mortalité infanto juvénile (moins de 5 ans) est passé de 124 en 2002 à 94 pour
1000 naissances vivantes (EDIM 2006). Le taux de mortalité infantile est réduit de 103
en 2002 à 67 pour 1000 naissances vivantes (EDIM 2006). La prévalence du VIH/SIDA
parmi les femmes enceintes (âgées de 15 – 24 ans) est réduite de 2.9% en 2002 à 2.1% en
2007 à 1.4% en 2009 et à 1.4% en 2011 selon le rapport DSME/PTPE. Selon le rapport
annuel de la DSME 2010, le « ratio » de mortalité maternelle intra – hospitalière semble
baisser régulièrement : de 550 en 2002 à 385 en 2006, 196 en 2008, 118 en 2009, à 94
pour 100.000 naissances vivantes en 2010. De plus, le taux d’accouchements assistés a
augmenté de 56,5% en 2009 à 58% en 2010.
Les prestations familiales se sont accrues, l’offre des soins d’obstétricaux d’urgence
s’est renforcée avec la décentralisation de l’accouchement eutocique dans la ville de
Djibouti et l’introduction des bonnes pratiques (gestion active du 3ème state de travail,
l’administration systématique de l’ocytocine, l’utilisation du sulfate de magnésium) dans
toutes les différentes structures en fonction de leur plateau technique. Les audits de décès
maternels sont faits à la maternité de référence Dar El Hanan. Les blocs opératoires de
trois régions (Dikhil, Tadjoura et d’Obock) sont opérationnels pour effectuer les
césariennes mais leur fonctionnalité est discontinue par manque de personnel. Une
maison d’attente à titre pilote a été construite au poste de santé de Daasbyo pour
accueillir les femmes qui habitent loin et ou ayant une grossesse pathologique. Les kits
d’accouchement et de césarienne sont mis en place dans les formations sanitaires. La

                                            43
PTPE du VIH a étendu son potentiel d’offres et les activités PCIME clinique couvrent
toutes les régions et 36 structures de sanitaires publiques de premier sur 43.
Le potentiel d’offre de soin du programme tuberculose s’est accru, les capacités de
diagnostiques ont été renforcées à travers la rénovation et l’équipement des anciens
laboratoires et l’ouverture de nouveaux laboratoires dans les formations sanitaires des
régions de l’intérieur. Les centres antituberculeux d’Ali-Sabieh et de Tadjourah ont été
réhabilités. Les sites de prise en charge par les antituberculeux ont évolués en nombre.
Ainsi, 15 Centres de Diagnostic et de Traitement (CDT) et 11 Centres de Traitement
Directement Observé (CTDO) sont fonctionnels. Le nombre de cas dépistés par année est
passé de 3 257 cas en 2007 à 3 717 cas en 2008 et 1 377 cas en 2009.
Les performances relativement correctes obtenues par les programmes TB, VIH/SIDA et
Paludisme restent précaires car menacées par les difficultés financières de l’organisme
national de gestion des fonds du Fond Mondial (principal source de financement de ces
programmes).

Composante 2 : Renforcement des systèmes de santé:
Cette composante finance les activités de renforcement de la capacité institutionnelle du
Ministère de la Santé et d’amélioration de la performance des différents systèmes de
santé pour appuyer les prestations de soins. Ce renforcement inclus les différentes
Directions du Ministère. De plus, cette composante appui l’Unité de Gestion des Projets
(UGP) du Ministère pour assurer une bonne gestion fiduciaire du projet relative à la
gestion financière, la passation des marchés et la gestion du plan environnemental. Cette
composante appui aussi les activités pour renforcer le suivi et évaluation du Projet,
incluant les enquêtes de satisfaction de la qualité des services de santé auprès des
prestataires de services et des clients, ainsi que les évaluations de l’impact du projet à la
clôture du projet. Cette composante couvre les activités des services et directions
suivantes:
    o Direction des Etudes, Planification et Coopération Internationale (DEPCI)
    o Direction de la Promotion de la Santé (DPS)
    o Institut Supérieur des Sciences de la Santé (ISSS)
    o Système d’Information Sanitaire (SIS)
    o Centrale d’Achat des Médicaments et Matériels Essentiels (CAMME)
    o Direction des Régions Sanitaires (DRS)
    o Inspection Générale des Services de Santé (IGSS)
    o Direction des Ressources Humaines et Financières (DRHF)
    o Service de Formation au Secrétariat Général du MS (SGS)

Cette composante a été réalisée de façon satisfaisante, les principaux attendus qui sont la
mise en place d’une Centrale d’Achats de Médicaments et Matériels Essentiels a pu être
effective et l’institution remplie sont rôle, la formation continue ou initiale du personnel a
été largement améliorée médical (étudiant à ISSS 66 en 2004 et 222 en 2007), le statut du
personnel para médical est revalorisé.
L’hôpital de référence bénéficie d’une autonomie statutaire depuis 2009.
La Direction de Planification et de la Coopération est fonctionnelle en dépit de la
faiblesse de sa dotation en ressource humaine et a concouru à la mise en place de



                                             44
partenariat pour le développement du secteur et à l’organisation de enquête qualité de
service.
Le Système d’Information Sanitaire est mise en place et est opérationnel ;
Les capacités de l’Unité de Gestion de Gestion de projets est accrues avec une maitrise
reconnue ;
L’approche communautaire des programmes et projets est aujourd’hui appuyée par une
direction outillée la DPS;
On notera cependant que les capacités et les moyens de beaucoup des départements mis
en place ont besoin d’être renforcés. Pour le cas particulier de la CAMME le
recouvrement des dotations à régler par le trésor public est à performer.

C. Principaux facteurs affectant le projet et externalités

       C1) Les facteurs favorables

   -   La volonté politique déclarée de réformer le système de soins, telle que reflétée
       par l’implication des plus hautes autorités de l’Etat et la fréquence élevée des
       réunions de suivi de l’exécution du projet et de l’implémentation du processus de
       réforme.
   -   La stabilité politique et gouvernementale ainsi que celle des cadres en charge de
       la mise en œuvre de la réforme dont une unité de gestion et de coordination
       dédiée à plein temps au projet.
   -   Les leçons tirées des expériences antérieures pour modifier la structure du
       financement du secteur de la santé.
   -   La fréquence des missions de supervision de la Banque Mondiale notamment au
       début du projet.

   C2) Les facteurs limitants

   -   L’impact négatif de la malnutrition sur la mortalité notamment des enfants dont
       les moyens de lutte efficaces et pérennes dépassent les seules prérogatives de la
       santé et qui a été aggravé par la flambée des prix alimentaires.
   -   Le nombre réduit de ressources humaines qualifiées et disponibles en matière de
       gestion de projets, aux niveaux stratégiques, programmatiques et opérationnels.
   -   Le nombre réduit de personnel médical à tous les niveaux.
   -   L’absence de bureaux d’études privés et de consultants ayant une expertise
       développée dans le domaine de la santé et ayant une connaissance suffisante du
       secteur à Djibouti.
   -   L’absence d’études détaillées préalables et de données de base lors de la
       formulation du projet.
   -   La non réalisation d’enquête nationale d’envergure pour renseigner les indicateurs
       d’impact.
   -   La participation au coût de la santé pour les bénéficiaires habitués à une gratuite
       intégrale.

    C2) Les facteurs catalysants

                                           45
Le facteur principal catalysant à retenir est que le PDSS a eu un effet lui-même catalysant
pour le financement du secteur de la santé. En effet, les partenaires ont été nombreux à
suivre grâce la BM a soutenir les gaps observés ci et là.
On notera l’apport de l’USAID, bailleur non traditionnel, qui a fourni une contribution
notable en matière de réhabilitation et l’équipe des postes de santé et le renforcement du
système.
Le renforcement du partenariat et de la coordination de bailleur autour du secteur, Groupe
des Partenaires de la Santé et la participation à IHP+.

D. Pérennité du projet

        D1) Viabilité politique
L’engagement manifeste des autorités de Djibouti à améliorer la situation sanitaire des
populations est un atout et une opportunité à saisir par les acteurs surtout les techniciens
en faisant des propositions de stratégies pertinentes, efficaces et efficientes dans l’optique
d’accélérer l’atteinte des OMD.

        D2) Pérennité des acquis
Le système de santé a réalisé des progrès significatifs en matière d’offre de soins
hospitaliers. Les plateaux techniques (infrastructures équipements et ressources
humaines) des hôpitaux ont été renforcés dans les hôpitaux surtout à Djibouti-ville. La
priorité majeure dans les années à venir en matière d’offre de soins est de mettre l’accent
sur la fonctionnalité des formations sanitaires des districts (PS, CSC et CMH) et surtout
le renforcement des pratiques familiales et communautaires efficaces dans le domaine de
la santé maternelle et infantile y compris la nutrition.
Ces efforts de renforcement des capacités des structures d’offres de soins ont été plus
centrés à Djibouti-ville. Cette option se justifie en partie au regard du facies
démographique du pays (58% de la population du pays réside à Djibouti ville). Toutefois,
des efforts ont été fournis pour rendre opérationnels les blocs opératoires de trois régions
(Dikhil, Obock et Tadjourah) mais leur fonctionnement est discontinue par manque de
personnel qualifié.
L’insuffisance numérique en ressources humaines qualifiées mais surtout
compétentes et motivées demeure le principal défi pour le renforcement des
performances du système de santé de Djibouti. Malgré les efforts de recrutement qui
ont fait passer l’effectif total du personnel du ministère de la santé de 1 551 en 2007 à
2 036 en 2010, il convient néanmoins de signaliser que cette augmentation en effectif de
personnel a été plus importante pour le personnel administratif que le personnel soignant.
L’effectif total (des Administrateurs civils, des Attachés d’administration, des Agents
d’administration, des Secrétaires d’administration et des Secrétaires de direction) est
passé de 98 en 2007 à 283 en 2010 (soit une augmentation de 189%) alors que l’effectif
total du personnel clé soignant (médecins spécialistes, médecins généralistes, infirmiers
et sages femmes y compris les auxiliaires) est passé de 469 en 2007 à 505 en 2010 (soit
une progression de 8%). Les nombres de médecins spécialistes et les Sages Diplômées
d’Etat sont restés stationnaires respectivement à 27 et 121 au cours de la période. Par



                                             46
contre, celui des médecins généralistes est passé de 43 en 2007 à 77 en 2010. Le
recrutement de 18 sages femmes nouvellement sortie de l’école est en cours.
En matière de gestion de ressources humaines, la situation n’a pas évoluée
significativement. Elle est toujours centralisée, les mesures novatrices de gestion
décentralisée et de motivation du personnel du personnel afin d’améliorer ses
performances et sa rétention dans les régions ne sont pas encore mises en œuvre. La
gestion des ressources humaines et financières est toujours cumulée au sein d’une même
direction. Une autre structure s’occupe de la formation du personnel. Au regard de
l’importance des ressources humaines et de l’importance de la formation avec la création
de l’école de médecine, il est souhaitable de revoir l’organigramme du ministère en
créant une direction centrale chargée spécialement de la gestion des ressources humaines.
Au niveau du sous-secteur pharmaceutique, la disponibilité, la gestion des stocks, le
contrôle de qualité et l’usage rationnel des médicaments sont insuffisants. L’organisation
et le fonctionnement du sous secteur pharmaceutique sont à renforcer.
Pour son bon fonctionnement la CAMME doit adopter le principe de paiement cash y
compris pour les dotations acquis sur le budget national.
Les capacités du système de santé en matière d’aide au diagnostic et de suivi des
traitements, le potentiel d’offre de services des laboratoires et d’imagerie médicale s’est
accru à travers surtout par la disponibilité du personnel et l’acquisition des appareils
d’hématologie, d’analyses chimiques de scanner et de radiologie. Les capacités de
maintenance et de remplacement du matériel doivent constituer une priorité.
Au plan de la décentralisation, les mesures institutionnelles et organisationnelles visant à
améliorer la décentralisation/déconcentration des services de santé, la régulation et le
contrôle, les performances des structures en matière d’offre de soins et services de qualité
(y compris la disponibilité des médicaments), le financement, le partenariat, le suivi et
l’évaluation notamment l’information sanitaire et la surveillance épidémiologique restent
à entreprendre urgemment pour la période restante du plan.
En termes d’impact, l’atteinte des OMD relatifs au secteur de la santé notamment les
OMD 4, 5 et 6 reste fortement conditionnée à des efforts importants à fournir dans la
réalisation des interventions à gain rapide surtout au niveau de la zone périurbaine de
Djibouti-ville et des districts de l’intérieur en rendant opérationnel les districts sanitaires.

        D3) Pérennité Financière
L’accession du Ministère de la santé à l’IHP+ constitue un atout majeur qui facilitera
l’évolution vers la signature d’un COMPACT pays en vue d’assurer une prévisibilité et
une efficacité du financement extérieur dans le cadre de la mise en œuvre de ce PNDS.
Pour ce faire, il est impératif de mettre en place un cadre partenarial élargi aux différents
acteurs sans distinction avec ses démembrements dans les régions.
Par ailleurs, les programmes prioritaires comme le TB/VIH/SIDA en particulier
nécessitent encore un support des partenaires et sont difficilement supportable par les
finances publiques. Par ailleurs, les capacités d’endettement du pays restent aussi limitées
d’où l’importance de trouvez de financement sous forme de dons pour consolider les
acquis du projet.

Annex 10. Context at Appraisal

A. Program Purpose and Project Development Objective

1. Program purpose and program phasing:

The purpose of the program was to support the Government of Djibouti's long-term
health sector development program in order to meet the Millennium Development Goals
(MDG) for the reduction of under-five child mortality and maternal mortality rate.
Despite its relatively high nominal per capita income of $780 (compared to an average of
$510 for Sub-Saharan Africa, $320 for Yemen, and $110 for Ethiopia), Djibouti had
some of the poorest social indicators in the world. The health situation in Djibouti was
currently very poor. Endemic and infectious diseases were common and on the rise. The
HIV/AIDS infection rate among adults was estimated between 8 and 12 percent. The
incidence rates of other diseases, such as STIs, malaria and TB was also on the rise.
Djibouti spent 7 percent of its GDP on health-care (split three ways between public,
private and donors with less than 40 percent public), with little apparent benefit. For
example, the infant mortality rate (IMR) of 106 per 1,000 live births was higher than the
average for Sub-Saharan Africa. The health infrastructure (human and physical), disease
programs, and financing system needed to be reformed in order to increase the efficiency,
equity and quality of the health sector. These facilities suffered from a lack of basic
medicines and qualified personnel. Malaria, which was almost nonexistent thirty years
ago, had become a major health problem. The general consensus within Djibouti, and
among its development partners, was that while urgent disease problems (such as malaria,
AIDS and TB), needed immediate attention, most of these programs were likely to fail
without accompanying systemic reform. A third of recurrent costs for health in Djibouti
were donor financed and with the planned withdrawal of France from direct budget
support, Djibouti needed to increase efficiency and find other resources to replace donor
financing over time.

The Government had developed a long-term strategic framework (Plan Directeur) to
respond to the situation and had developed a medium-term action plan (Plan d'Action).
These Plans encompassed wide ranging sector reforns combined with investments to
improve the functionality of the system. The proposed actions ranged from improving
facilities and public health services to far reaching reforms in drug supply management
and facilities management. The plans included cost-sharing with beneficiaries and a pilot
cost-sharing project had already started. These plans had been widely discussed in the
country and had been endorsed by the Government and by civil society. They were
shared with donors during a conference held in Djibouti from February 12 to 13, 2002.
IDA's support to the Government's program would be in two forms - an APL to support
the Plan Directeur over the period of 2002 to 2015 and a special EHV/AIDS control
project. The APL would address issues of improving health, services targeting reductions
in maternal and child mortality as its overall objective. The APL would support
investments to improve the quality of services and support the long-term reforms
necessary to assure that the gains from the investments are sustainable. The parallel
HIV/AIDS project would address issues of HIV/AIDS, TB, other AIDS opportunistic

                                           50
infections, community-based care for AIDS victims and their families, and female genital
cutting.

The proposed APL would be implemented in three phases. Phase I from 2002-2007
would focus on (a) improving maternal and child health-care, including better
management practices; (b) improving availability of medicines; (c) improving human
resources; and (d) increasing the capacity of the Ministry of Health (MOH) to develop,
implement and monitor reforms. Phase II from 2006-2010 would help to consolidate the
investments in service improvement brought about by first phase improvements in
facilities, drug supply and human resources through consolidation of the gains in the first
phase and setting the system on the path to attain sustainability. Phase III from 2009-
2014 would support the changes necessary to make benefits from the Phase I and Phase II
sustainable on a long-term basis.

B. Strategic Context

1. Sector-related Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) goal supported by the project
(Document number: 21414-DJI - Date of latest CAS discussion: 12/19/2000)
The project would support the third CAS objective of improving human development
indicators by raising school enrollment, improving access to health services, and
containing the spread of infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS, as well
as improving access of the poor to basic services and economic opportunities and
targeting assistance to the most vulnerable.

Corporate and Regional Strategic Objectives Supported by the Project

The APL and the first Phase project would support actions designed to achieve the
corporate goals, mainly the Millennium Development Goals for reductions in maternal
and child mortality and increase in immunization coverage. The project would also
support two major objectives in the MENA regional development strategy: public sector
management and gender. Public sector management would be addressed through support
for reforms designed to improve the health sector management. The principal objective of
the project includes improvement in women's health conditions, not only for those using
health facilities but also, through community outreach programs, for those who, for
cultural reasons, do not use health facilities. HIV/AIDS, TB and other AIDS related
problems would be addressed by the parallel HIV/AIDS project.

2. Main sector issues and Government strategy

Sector Background

Djibouti is a city state with a population in 2002 of approximately 650,000, 70 percent of
whom live around the capital city, and another 10 percent in other urban centers. Given
Djibouti's level of urbanization, its health system functions more like a municipal-state
system rather than a national system. The system is dominated by a national referral
hospital (Hôpital Général Peltier), which is at the top of the health pyramid in Djibouti.

                                            51
At the secondary level, Djibouti-City has three other special public health facilities: (a)
the Centre medico-social des fonctionnaires or Dispensaire Pierre Pascal for civil
servants and their families; (b) the Forces Nationales de Securité for the police and their
families; and the Armée Nationale Djiboutienne for the military and their families. In
addition, Djibouti-City and its suburbs have two other hospitals: (a) the Hôpital de
Balballa, and (b) the Maternité Dar El Hanan (legally a part of Peltier). The MOH also
runs the Centre Paul Faure for TB treatment, and the Centre de Prophylaxie for treating
HIV/AIDS and other STIs. At the primary level, ten primary healthcare facilities
(dispensaires), run by the MOH, were quasi-functional and suffered from a lack of
medicines and qualified personnel. In addition, there were 16 rural health centers,
generally staffed by paramedics without formal training. These facilities are visited
weekly by doctors from the CMH, situated in the headquarters of each district which are
secondary hospitals with in-patient facilities. There were private pharmacies and doctors,
and other health systems run by the Ministry of Labor and the French military.

The general consensus within Djibouti, and among its development partners, was that
while urgent disease problems, such as AIDS and TB, needed immediate attention, most
of these programs were likely to fail without accompanying systemic reform. Physical
accessibility to health-care services in Djibouti was not a major problem since the
majority of the population lives in a few urban centers. However, health facilities must
have an adequate infrastructure, and be organized and managed effectively. Other
dimensions of a quality delivery system include services that are accountable to clients,
promote adequate utilization, and offer good continuity of care of the highest technical
quality.

Main Sector Issues

The major issues in the health sector, from effects to causes, were: (a) high death rates,
particularly maternal and child mortality rates; (b) increasing rates of TB, HIV/AIDS and
other infectious diseases; (c) malaria had become endemic; (d) vaccination coverage was
stagnating or declining; (e) a general lack of skills and shortage of personnel, particularly
in remote facilities; (f) chronic and sometimes acute shortages of medicines and other
consumables in health facilities; (g) poor sector management including capacity to
monitor and plan; and (h) ineffective hospital management because the heads of hospitals
did not have discretionary authority over staff or budget. Despite these poor health
outcomes, the total health spending is almost 7 percent of GDP. Part of the reason for this
high expenditure is the high costs of staff (many foreign) and the high costs of medicines
and other inputs. In addition, poor system management, excessive reliance on curative
care and large periods during which facilities are idle, all lead to high cost and low
impact. This is particularly troublesome given the fact that 70 percent of the population is
concentrated in one large urban area.

Government Strategy

The Government proposed to address these problems by: (a) vastly improving the quality
of service offered by health facilities in order to attract more patients to the facilities; (b)

                                              52
launching national campaigns against AIDS, TB and other infectious diseases; (c) starting
a campaign against malaria; (d) reinvigorating the vaccination campaign; (e) training
more paramedics and improving their conditions of service; (f) introducing cost-sharing
and community pharmacies complemented by a National Drug Fund to assure a long-
term sustainable supply of medicines; (g) restructuring sector management including
establishing a Directorate for Planning and Information; and (h) providing administrative
autonomy to major health facilities. The Government was quite aware that it needed to
focus first on the key elements of improving services (such as availability of medicines
and better preventive care) to keep public support strong for health-care reforms. Thus,
they were giving high priority to addressing the drug supply question and resolving the
issue of adequate and qualified personnel in health centers.

The Government had already moved ahead on defining the framework for overall sector
management restructuring by passing a new general law for the health sector. This law
would be progressively implemented through specific decrees which were being
prepared. The MOH was restructured by creating four specialized Directorates
(epidemiology, basic care, HIV/AIDS and the Peltier Hospital) and separating basic care
services from tertiary care. In addition, a planning Directorate was created to develop and
monitor information systems and provide donor coordination. A Credit Administrative
Unit (CAU), referred to by its French initials UGP (Unité de Gestion des Projets), was
established under the aegis of the Secretary General's office to manage disbursement,
procurement, and financial management for all projects.

3. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices

The APL would support most elements of the Government strategy except for those that
were being addressed under the parallel HIV/AIDS project or financed by other donors.
During the donors meeting in Djibouti in February 2002, donors pledged to support rural
health centers, blood safety, and overseas training for Djiboutian doctors in France or
other Francophone countries.

The Phase I project would focus on: improving maternal and child health services to deal
with the low quality of care and the poor management of health facilities; address
emergency drug needs as well as long-term drug supply given the existing shortage of
drugs in health facilities and the current high cost of drugs in the private sector; support
malaria programs, given the resurgence of malaria in the country as a whole; support
vaccination programs which have suffered from inconsistent attention; increase the
capacity to train more paramedics by strengthening the national health training center to
provide up-to-date and quality training; and support the Ministry's capacity to monitor
health conditions and the reform, through the establishment of good monitoring and
evaluation procedures from the bottom up (Integrated Management of Childhood
Infections (IMCI) model, etc.). The project would also support improved sector
management, such as the autonomy of Hôpital Peltier, and support reforms in the
pharmaceutical sector.




                                            53
Two approaches were considered for the project. The first approach was to start by
focusing on sector reforms, and the second was to give priority to service improvements
while working on sector reforms. The second option was chosen. The strategic choice
was to start with service improvement during Phase I, such as improving maternal and
child health, medicines and human resources, as a priority. This was likely to lead to
sustained service improvements and secure public support for all aspects of the reform. In
addition, with regard to hospital autonomy, it was decided to opt for full administrative
autonomy, which would include control over personnel decisions and operating budget,
thereby ensuring that the hospitals, which are key magnets for the population (Djibouti is
mainly urban) are adequately staffed with qualified personnel and that drugs are available
on a regular basis. The idea of full financial autonomy was dropped because the studies
on full financial autonomy suggest that this may often result in the poor being shut off
from health services.

4. Program description and performance triggers for subsequent loans

The APL would support sector reforms and investments necessary to improve the quality
of health-care in Djibouti over the period 2002 to 2014. The Government's long-term
Plan Directeur would guide the APL, while its short-term Plan d'Action would guide the
first phase of the project.

The Phase I project would improve:

(a) health services through the improvement of: (i) physical infrastructure and human
capacity in health facilities, (ii) establishment of Integrated Management of Childhood
Infections (IMCI) programs in all facilities, (iii) the malaria control program, and (iv) the
immunization program;
(b) the availability of qualified and trained personnel by (i) improving the capacity and
curricula of the CFPS, and (ii) improving service conditions for qualified paramedics;
(c) availability of drugs and medical consumables through (i) an emergency stock of
drugs in health facilities, (ii) establishment of a self-sustaining independent drug fund
CAMME, and (iii) support the development of community pharmacies at facility levels to
buy generic drugs from the CAMME and sell them at low cost to the patients; and (d)
sector management through capacity building in MOH and support for the administrative
autonomy of the Peltier Hospital.

The triggers from Phase I (2002-2007) to Phase II (2006-2010) were expected to
include:
1. Increase the proportion of births occurring in health facilities from 44 percent (in 2002)
to 55 percent;
2. Increase by 50 percent the proportion of sick children seen in IMCI facilities whose
illnesses are assessed and treated in accordance with IMCI clinical practice guidelines;
3. Reduce by 30 percent (the 2002 base) the proportion of maternal mortality in health
facilities attributed to infection and post-partum bleeding;
4. Distribute bed-nets to at least 40 percent of children in high risk malaria areas; and



                                             54
5. Increase from 45 percent to 55 percent the proportion of children 12-23 months of age
who are vaccinated with DPT3 before 12 months of age.

The triggers from Phase II (2006-2010) to Phase III (2009-2014) were expected to
include:
1. Increase the proportion of women giving birth in health facilities from 49 percent in
2002 to 65 percent;
2. Increase the proportion of children 12-23 months of age who are vaccinated with
DPT3 before 12 months of age from 45 percent to 80 percent;
3. Reduce by 50 percent (from the 2002.base) the proportion of maternal mortality in
health facilities attributed to infection and post-partum bleeding; and
4. Maintain at a minimum the allocation of 350 million Djibouti Francs in the current
year budget (2002) to cover the cost of medicines for the poor and special programs such
as HIV/AIDS.

Annex 11. Detailed Project Description

THE ORIGINAL PROJECT OF 2002

The original project of 2002 (Phase I of the APL) consisted of four components:

Component 1 or A. Improve Health Services:

(i) Improve the physical and human capacity of health facilities. This sub-component
would contribute to rehabilitating the maternity, emergency services and pediatric
services at the Peltier Hospital. In addition, technical capacity would be strengthened for
urban dispensaries through training, equipment and medicines to attract patients who
would otherwise go to the Peltier Hospital.
(ii) Safe-motherhood programs. Strengthen the Safe Motherhood Initiative, principally
by improving the management of obstetrical complications and emergencies in health
facilities that can be managed by both surgical and non-surgical interventions through
better training, increased availability of medications, and infrastructure improvements.
The training will be organized in short programs at CFPS bringing in national and
international experts. The project will also reinforce and expand some promising
initiatives to better educate the population about women's health issues (through
community health workers), mobilize resources to promote positive health outcomes
(through non-governmental organizations), and better monitor births being attended by
Traditional Birth Attendants (TBAs) in the community. The project intends to strengthen
community participation throughout the phase of implementation. First, outreach
activities led by community health workers will promote positive health practices and
promote dialogue between service providers and recipients. Second, the project will
support capacity building activities for community based organizations, associations and
NGOs involved in health related activities. Third, representatives of local communities
and/or NGOs will become members of technical committees such as the IMCI Family
and Community Practices Technical sub-group. Fourth, the project will maintain ongoing
dialogue with the community in order to understand and take into account the
community's priorities and to build consensus around care related issues, such as cost-
sharing for drugs. Such dialogue and capacity building during the first phase of the APL
will lay the ground work for establishing viable community-based
pharmacies in later phases.
(iii) Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses (IMCI). Apply the Djiboutian Safe
Motherhood model (sound central management, human capacity building at all levels,
and strengthening of selective system supports), and extend the cross-institutional
collaborations that have been developed by the Safe-Motherhood Initiative at all levels
(CFPS, local NGOs, Community Health Workers, mass media, etc.) to advance child
health aims. The Project will both support the WHO-endorsed initiative of early
implementation of IMCI in four urban health facilities (Engueila, Arhiba, Farahad and
Ambouli) and extend this support to four additional urban health facilities and the four
district hospitals to achieve national coverage. The standard WHO approach of
strengthening health worker skills, improving health system supports, and improving



                                            56
family and community practices that has been followed in other WHO/Eastern
Mediterranean Regional Office and WHO/AFRO countries will be adopted.
(iv) Reinforce malaria control efforts. Targeted communicable disease activities
intended to improve malaria control and routine immunization services in Djibouti can
enhance the efforts of IMCI and Safe-motherhood to improve child and maternal health.
In addition to improving the case management of fever and the promotion of bednet use
through IMCI, the project will support complementary efforts by the Division of Hygiene
and Epidemiology to reduce malaria-related mortality and morbidity. The Project will
support a variety of malaria control strategies, including plans to improve the diagnostic
capacity of lab technicians, to promote the adoption of personal protection measures in
communities not immediately served by health facilities, to extend selected vector control
activities, and to institute sentinel surveillance.
(v) Support immunization efforts. lMCI's policy of vaccinating every sick child in need
will be complemented by efforts to strengthen routine immunization services for well
children. Particular emphasis will be given to better training of health personnel, with
particular emphasis on improving health workers' interpersonal and patient education
skills; organizational improvements to reduce waiting time and improve cold chain
management; ensuring routine availability of all antigens; and ensuring completion of the
multi-dose series of DPT3 for all children.

Component 2 or B: Improve Availability and Quality of Human Resources: This is
one of the major problems facing Djibouti: the overall shortage of qualified personnel is
reinforced by disincentives for them to work because of poor service conditions.

(i) Expand capacity of the Centre de Formation du Personnel de la Sante (CFPS). The
physical capacity of the CFPS will be expanded to produce more paramedics both for the
three-year course and the two-year course. The enhanced capacity will also help CFPS
organize continuing education programs in its facilities. In addition, internet access to
health information will be made available in the CFPS library for use by all personnel
working in the sector.
(ii) Short-term courses. The project will finance short-term courses at the CFPS as
needed. The courses which will be made available first are likely to include training for
health workers on managing drug supply and helping to set-up community pharmacies,
training in IMCI and safe-motherhood. Additional courses are planned in training of
health workers on counseling and interpersonal communication, training of supervisors
on supervision and technical service delivery activities related to immunization, safe-
motherhood, IMCI and malaria and training of health facility managers and district level
managers on managerial skills. Training courses will be offered as needed bringing in
expertise from inside and outside the country. The project will finance external trainers,
development of training modules and other direct costs of short-term training.
(iii) Improve service conditions for paramedical workers. Credit covenants will include
improvement in the job conditions offered to fully trained para-medics (those with
Diplômes d'Etat) bringing them to a similar level as the Instituteurs with civil service
status in the Ministry of Education. This will reduce the drop-out rate of trained people
from paramedical jobs to other jobs. In addition, to attract qualified paramedics to remote



                                            57
locations and replace the untrained personnel there, a premium will need to be paid
similar to that for teachers in remote areas. This will also be covered by a credit covenant.

Component 3 or C: Improve Drug Supply

(i) Emergency supply of medicines and other medical consumables. Given the acute
shortage of drugs and consumables in health facilities, the project will finance an initial
stock of essential drugs for health facilities. The amount and type of drugs will be based
on the national list which has been established by type of facility. A pilot program for
cost-sharing through community pharmacies will be tried along with the emergency
stock.
(ii) Train MOH personnel in drug stock management and helping to set up community
pharmacies. The MOH personnel need training in managing drug supplies and eventually
in setting up community pharmacies which would provide low-cost generic drugs
acquired from the drug fund. The training will be based on existing modules prepared by
UNICEF for the Initiative du Bamako and will be offered through the CFPS.
(iii) Support the establishment of a Drug Fund (CAMME). The project will finance the
setting up of a a drug fund (CAMME). CAMME will be set up as an NGO recognized
officially as a public service organization (association à but non lucratif reconnue
d'utilité publique) and able to receive and manage public funds. CAMME will operate
under special arrangements with the Government which will include an operations
manual approved by both parties. CAMMIE will buy drugs from the lowest-cost, quality
sources and sell them to the public and non-profit health establishments with a small
mark-up to finance its operating costs. A Business Plan been prepared and financial
simulations carried out which show that CAMME is expected to become financially
sustainable in a reasonable period of time. The public health establishments will either
sell the drugs through a community pharmacy or directly (in the case where they are
legally autonomous), and the proceeds of the sales will be used for restocking. The prices
will be agreed upon by the MOH beforehand and prescription protocols established to
assure that there is no tendency to over-prescribe to increase revenues. The public budget
will also finance drugs and is expected to cover the difference between cost-sharing
revenues and needs. The difference is expected to be significant as there will be drugs
which have public good elements and may need subsidies and this amount will be
financed by the public budget - CAMME itself should eventually be financially
independent. The project will finance the initial stock of drugs and technical assistance
and training necessary for a drug fund. Physical rehabilitation of facilities and equipment
has already been financed by another donor.

Component 4 or D: Improve Sector Management. This will be supported in five ways:

(i) Support the administrative autonomy for the Peltier Hospital. Technical assistance
and training will be provided to support the autonomy of this hospital. The support
provided to improve the facilities under Component A will also contribute to making the
autonomy viable.
(ii) Support the capacity of the new Directorate of Planning, Health Information and
Donor Coordination (DEPCI). This will be done through the provision of training,

                                             58
international technical assistance, national technical assistance and direct support to carry
out surveys. DEPCI will take the lead in monitoring impact and the surveys will be a
major part of the work. Surveys to be financed during Phase I include PAPFAM (Pan
Arab Population and Family Health Survey) as two rounds of quality of service surveys
at health facilities. In addition, equipment and other assistance needed to revitalize the
health information system will be provided through equipment and consultant services.
DEPCI will coordinate the impact assessment activity, which will include surveys
assessing the quality of care from the user's perspective, and which will be conducted
every two years during the life of the project in order to monitor impact. In addition,
focus group interviews with users of health services will provide a better understanding
of the knowledge, attitudes and expectations of people with regard to health-care. It will
also assess people's willingness to share costs for tangible health related inputs such as
drugs, and under what circumstances in order to design effective community pharmacy
initiatives.
(iii) Support the capacity of other technical directorates of the MOH. The new
reorganization implies a need for training and technical assistance. Specific support will
be necessary for the newly created Directorate of Basic Care to outline and define its
functions and the service role of each type of facility. In addition, the MOH staff will be
trained in environmental safeguards. Resources for short-term training and consultants
will be made available to meet needs as they arise. Technical assistance will be provided
to assess the possibility of integrating the delivery of maternal and child health services at
the health facility level. These integrated services should be built on the clinical service
delivery elements of IMCI and expanded reproductive health services including Family
Planning and Essential Obstetric Care. The assessment should include a health facilities
survey to assess the capacity of the existing facilities for delivering integrated services
and provide recommendations for upgrading their capacity in order to do so. Based on the
results of this assessment, further technical assistance can be provided to identify this
package of services and development of clinical standards.
(iv) Support Capacity building for Operations and Maintenance. While the institution
of cost-sharing will provide resources for better O&M, it will be necessary to provide
technical capacity so that the maintenance may be carried out. The project will support
construction and equipping of a maintenance workshop to be located at the Peltier
Hospital but with service responsibilities across the country.
(iv) Support the Credit Administration Unit (CAU), referred to by its French initials
UGP – Unité de Gestion des Projets. The CAU as part of the MOH's new structure,
reports directly to the Secretary General of the MOH. Its main role will be to carry out
the procurement, financial management and reporting needs for donor funded projects,
which will be executed by the technical directorates. The project will provide the
necessary support to the CAU to manage the credit.

THE ADDITIONAL FINANCING OF 2009

The additional financing of 2009 included financing for Components 1 and 4. Original
components two (improving availability and quality of health personnel) and three
(improving access and availability of drugs) will be supported under component four only



                                             59
in terms of strengthening the management capacity of High Institute of Health Sciences
and the CAMME.

Component 1 (or A) – Improving the Health Service Delivery Performance (US$3.6
million equivalent).

The additional financing will continue supporting the delivery of: (i) child health services
such as immunization, IMCI, and treatment of malnutrition; (ii) maternal child health
services such as perinatal care, family planning, skilled-attended delivery, and emergency
obstetric care; and will support the additional activities, originally supported under the
HIVIAIDS, Malaria and Tuberculosis project, related to the delivery of: (iii)prevention
and treatment services of HIV/AIDS and other prevalent communicable diseases such as
VCT, DOTS, and malaria cases. This component will finance minor civil works, limited
medical equipment, office equipment, office supplies, training, and technical assistance.
Specifically, this component will expand on the following services:

Nutrition services. Improvements in screening of malnutrition among under-five children
and pregnant women coupled with nutrition education and practices taught in feeding
centers in primary and secondary level health facilities are expected to reduce the
malnutrition by 30 percent, according to the PNDS 11.
Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses (IMCI). IMCI was introduced in 2004 and
was scaled up to the second level of service delivery. It is planned to further extend this
program to the health posts so that it is implemented in the all the service delivery
network. It is expected that more than 95 percent of Djiboutian children under 5 years old
will be treated using IMCI protocols and guidelines.
Enlarged Program on Immunizations. Several combined strategies such as Reach Each
District, Advanced Outreach, and National Immunization Days in addition to
strengthening routine immunizations in all health facilities will be implemented in order
to immunize more than 90 percent of children before their first birthday with BCG,
pentavalent and anti-measles.
Maternal and Neonatal Health (MNH) services. The MNH program provides a wide
range of services, including prevention and treatment of malnutrition, perinatal care,
skilled attended deliveries, IST management, family planning, and prevention of mother
to child transmission of HIV/AIDS (PMTCT). Emergency Obstetric and Neonatal Care
was introduced in 2005 and is being extended to all regions of the country in order to
reduce maternal mortality rates. In addition, mortality audits (verbal autopsies) will be
conducted.
Prevention and Treatment of HIV/AIDS services. The HIV/AIDS Control Program
provides a wide range of services, including communication for behavior change,
community based interventions, VCT, screening pregnant women in antenatal care,
PMTCT, and multisectoral activities through focal points in various ministries, in
addition to treatment. While acceptance of VCT by pregnant women is almost universal
at antenatal clinics, improvements are needed for women to return to collect the test
results and receive post counseling services. HIV positive individuals are oriented
through a peer support group to provide social support services. In addition, they are
enlisted in the ARV Medical College (Collège des ARV), consisting of a panel of

                                            60
practicing physicians, to determine their clinical eligibility for receiving ARV treatment
and the treatment protocol.
Detection and Treatment of Tuberculosis. In addition to implementing the DOTS, the TB
control program is increasingly focusing on the improvements of outreach services aimed
at tracing drop-out patients under treatment and examining all household contacts of TB
patients. Also, screening of TB patients for HIV will be strengthened.
Prevention and Treatment of Malaria. A vector control program focusing on outdoor
insecticide spraying will be conducted regularly prior to the seasonal increase of malaria
cases. This will be coupled with the distribution of insecticide impregnated bed-nets for
pregnant women and under five children residing in highly endemic areas. In terms of
diagnosis and case management, there will be an increased use of rapid diagnostic tests
for malaria in first line health facilities, and the result will be confirmed by microscopy at
CMH laboratories.

Component 2 (or D) - Strengthening of Health Systems (US$3.4 million equivalent).

This component will continue financing activities aimed at strengthening the MOH
management capacity and improving the performance of the different health systems in
support of health services. These include different MOH Directorates such as the health
regions, health promotion, human resources, drugs and medical supplies, disease
surveillance, and information systems. This component will also support the UGP and the
ES in management of the project activities and fiduciary functions, including financial
management, procurement, and environment. The component will also strengthen the
program monitoring and evaluation, including health facility and client satisfaction
surveys. Specifically, this component would provide the necessary funds for minor civil
works, limited medical equipment, office equipment, office supplies, training, technical
assistance and will support demand creation activities such as social mobilization and
community outreach. Specifically, this component will expand on the following services:

Directorate of Epidemiology and Information System. The support of this directorate will
continue in order to strengthen the health information systems, including standardization
of the monthly service reports from the health facilities, harmonization of the reporting
requirements to the different services, and providing regular feedback quarterly reports
and annual statistical reports.
Directorate of Health Promotion. The support to this directorate is new and will focus on
strengthening its capacity in order to provide outreach and communication services to
stimulate demand for maternal and child health services and preventive measures. These
activities will include training of community health agents and conducting outreach
campaigns.
The High Institute of Health Sciences (HIHS). The Center for Training of Health
Personnel was elevated to HIHS in order to provide a wider range and higher level of
training to health personnel. The additional financing will support the continuation of
nurse and midwife training and will also expand its support to new categories of health
workers in order to respond to the growing needs of the health sector in human resources.
The Drug Fund. The project has been supporting the establishment of the Drug Fund and
its supply of essential drugs and medical supplies. The additional financing will continue

                                             61
its support to strengthen the Drug Fund management capacity and ensure its financial
sustainability.
The Directorate of Studies, Planning and International Cooperation. The project will
continue its support to this critical directorate responsible for the strategic planning of the
health sector and the coordinator of the health surveys. The project will support a number
of studies including a health expenditure and utilization survey and a national health
accounts study.
The Directorate of Health Regions. The project will support this newly created
directorate responsible for decentralization of the health system to the regional level. The
project will support capacity building of this new directorate as well as the development
of its management systems.
The Directorate of Human Resources and Finance, the Office of the Inspector General,
and the Office of Training and Continuing Education. The project will also support the
institutional capacity building of these directorates and services as part of the MOH effort
to strengthen its overall capacity to manage the reforms.
