RAP of Yixing Pumped Storage Plant
Objectives of the RAP and the Definition of Resettlement Terminology.
This Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) is prepared according to the Laws and
Regulations of PRC, and local area as well as the Guidelines of the World Bank
(Operational Directive for Involuntary Resettlement OD 4.30). The purpose of this
document is to set out an Action plan for the Resettlement and Rehabilitation of
the Project Affected Persons (PAPs) to ensure that they will benefit from the
project and their standards of living will improve or at least be restored after the
project impact.
Acquisition of land and other assets for the project will adversely affect the
livelihood of persons who live, work or earn their living on the land that will be
acquired for the project. PAPs are defined as those persons whose income or
livelihoods will be adversely affected by land acquisition for the project. PAPs
include the following categories:
a) persons who have a title, right, interest, in structures (houses, enterprises,
shelters, or public buildings), land (including residential, agricultural, and grazing
land)or any other asset acquired or possessed, in full or in part, permanently or
temporarily;
b) persons who use the structures, land or assets described above; or persons
whose business, occupation, work, place of residence or habitat adversely
affected; or
c) persons whose standard of living is adversely affected as a consequence of
land acquisition.
A definition of PAPs is given below:
Definition of the PAPs: "Affected Persons" means persons who on account of
the execution of the project had or would have their: a) standard of living
adversely affected; or b) right, title or interest in any house, land (including
premises, agricultural and grazing land) or any other fixed or movable asset
acquired or possessed, temporarily or permanently; or c) business, occupation.
work or place of residence or habitat adversely affected, and "affected Person"
means individually all those who qualify as "Affected persons."
PAPs may be individuals or legal persons such as a company, a public institution.
Definition of PAPs is not limited to their legal registration or permission to live or
conduct business in the affected location, or their title to property Thus, it
includes:
a) all those affected by the project regardless of their legal rights or absence
thereof to the assets being taken; and
b) persons without residential permit to live in a certain area.
Therefore all such persons who are affected will need to considered and recorded
as PAPs, regardless of their legal connection to assets land or location.



RAP of Yixing Pumped Storage Plant
If there are more than one person, family or household using or holding a title to
the same land or property that is acquired, they will be compensated and
rehabilitated according to the loss they suffer, their rights, and the impact on their
living standards.
The definition of PAPs is linked directly to the adverse effect of the project,
regardless of legal rights title or interest.
All PAPs are entitled to the improvement or at least restoration of their standards
of living, and compensation for the material losses they suffer. Compensation for
assets will cover replacement cost. No deductions or discounts will be applied to
the compensation amount for depreciation or other reasons. All PAPs deriving an
economic benefit from the affected land and property are entitled to receive
rehabilitation benefits in addition to the compensation for their assets lost. Those
PAPs without title, authorization or legal permission to reside, conduct business,
cultivate land or construct structures are eligible for rehabilitation of their
livelihoods and compensation for their assets on an equal footing with those with
formal legal title, authorization or permissions to the assets.
The term RESETTLEMENT includes:
a) the relocation of living quarters;
b) finding acceptable new employment for those whose jobs are affected;
c) restoration (or compensation) of affected productive resources such as land,
workplaces, trees and infrastructure;
d) restoration of other adverse effect on PAPs' living standards (quality of life)
through land acquisition (such as the adverse effects of pollution);
e) restoration of or compensation for affected private and public enterprises;
f) restoration of adversely affected on cultural or common property.
Rehabilitation means: the restoration of the PAPs' resource capacity to continue
with productive activities or lifestyles at a level higher or at least equal to that
before the project.
The objective of this RAP is to provide a plan for the resettlement and
rehabilitation of the PAPs so that their losses will be compensated and their
standards of living will be improved or at least restored to the pre-project levels.
To achieve these objectives the plan provides for rehabilitation measures so that
the income earning potential of individuals are restored to sustain their livelihoods.
Affected productive resources of businesses (enterprises including shops) and
public property. Infrastructure and cultural property will also be improved or at
least restored to their pre-project levels.

1. PROJECT DESCRIPTION
1.1. Project Background
In the recent two decades, the economy in the East China Region has been
rapidly developed, and the living standards of the people are continuously
improved; meanwhile, the contradictions between power supply and demand
in the region become more acute. Recently, along with continuous increase of
the power supply, the power consumption structure is also continuously
adjusted, in which the power consumption percentage for living and the
tertiary industry is obviously going up, average day load rate continuously
decreased and the power consumption gap between the peak and the foot
continuously increase in the grid. This situation affect the local industries and
agricultural production and local people's living seriously; thus, the larger peak
regulation capacity is more and more necessary for the Grid.
Due to the limitation by the exploitable hydropower potential in Jiangsu
province, the peak regulation capacity is at present taken by thermal plants.
However, the thermal plants have a limited ability in peak regulation and can
hardly meet the need of the grid operation, resulting in unfavorable influence
on economic and safe operation of the grid. Construction of pumped storage
power plant will play an important role in guaranteeing the safe and economic
operation of the grid. Construction of the Yixing Pumped Storage Power
Plant(YPSPP), as one of the good pumped storage projects, is imperative
under the circumstance.
1.2. Project Components and Basic Conditions
YPSPP is located in Tongguan mountain area, 7km southwest from Yixing City,
Jiangsu Province. Composed of upper and lower reservoirs, water conveyance
system, underground power house, switchyard and 500kV transmission line, etc.
the YPSPP is a daily regulation pumped storage power station, with installed
capacity of 1000MW(4X250MW). The annual power production of YPSPP will be
1.49 billion kw * h, and the annual pumping power cost will be 1.96 billion kw * h.
The project components is described as below:
A. Upper reservoir
The upper reservoir is located in the gully near the top of the Tongguanshan
Mountain top. It will take use of the top part of the gulch on the northeast slope of
the main mountain peak after excavation and backfilling. The main dam of the
reservoir will be an asphalt concrete face rockfill dam, and subsidiary dam will be
a concrete gravity dam. The dam crest is at elevation 474.20m. The normal
reservoir water level is at 471.50m, the dead water level at 428.60m. The total
reservoir storage is 5.307 million cubic meters and the catchment area above the
dam site is 0.21 square kilometers.
B. Lower reservoir
3



RAP of Yixing Pumped Storage Plant
The lower reservoir is located on the northeast foot of the Tongguanshan
Mountain, only 1.5km away from the No.104 national highway. It will take use of
the gully where the existing Huiwu Reservoir is located. The lower reservoir will
be built by raising the dam height and newly building the rockfill dam with clay
core and enlarging the existing reservoir. The lower reservoir will have its dam
crest at El. 83.40m, the max. water level at El. 80.60m, normal water level at
78.90m, dead water level at El. 57.00m. The total reservoir storage will be 5.728
million cubic meters and the catchment area above the dam site 1.87 square
kilometers. A simply built highway will link the upper and lower reservoirs, and
connect No. 104 national highway.
C. Water conveyance system
The water conveyance system will be arranged in the mountain body between the
upper and lower reservoirs. The system will be composed of inlet/outlets of the
upper reservoir, upstream emergency gate shaft, power tunnel, tailwater tunnel,
tailwater surge shaft and inlet/outlets of the lower reservoir, etc.
D. Underground power house
The underground caverns, for main and auxiliary powerhouses, main transformer
hall, busbar tunnel, access tunnel to the powerhouse and outgoing line tunnel,
etc., will be arranged in the middle portion of the water conveyance system, about
320m deep in the mountain.
D. Switchyard and Transmission Line
The switchyard on the ground will be arranged on the relatively flat mountain
slope above the main transformer hall, at elevation of 310.00m. From the
switchyard, the transmission line be laid to the north, and then turned left to the
west through Nanmenshan, Shanhualin and pass over the upper reservoir of the
"planning pumped storage plant 11", and then turn right through Jingshanwu, pass
over the upper reservoir of the "planning pumped storage plant 11" again, to the
west side of Zhuposhan, then turn north, pass over the Ninghang Expressway to
Yini Substation which located in the Minglan Administrative Village, Xingjie Town.
The total length will be 6.3km and 80% of them will be mountain area and 20% of
them will be hillock. No house relocation will be occurred and the land requisition
will revolve some forest land from Nanyueshi Branch of Yixing Forestry Farm, and
some tea garden from Baihe AV and Mingnan AV of Xingjie Town.
E. Water Supply System
In order to meet the water demand for initial reservoir impoundment, water
demand for project construction, water supply for daily operation of the power
station and irrigation of 700 mu land of Meiyuan Village, a water replenishing
works will be constructed. The water replenishing works will be composed of
Stepl and Step 2 pumping stations, steel pipes and water pool for construction.
The replenishing water will be sourced from the Huangtong River that extends to
Tuanjiu. The Step 1 pumping station will be located on the east bank of the
Huangtong River on south side Donghe Road. The Step 2 pumping station and
the water poll for construction will be arranged in the lower reservoir area. The
4



RAP of Yixing Pumped Storage Plant
water pipes will be roughly 3220m long, 500mm in inner diameter.
1.3. The Scope of Project Impact and Service
The land acquisition and housing relocation of YPSPP will affect Yixing forestry,
Yixing environment science park, Yixing Delelopment Zone, Guijing township,
Shanjuan town, Xingjie Town, 173 microwave station and Yixing TV station, etc. in
which only Meiyuan village, Shanmen village and Huangtong village of Yixing
environment science park were involved in cultivated land acquisition.
YPSPP will be a daily regulation pumped storage power station, with capacity
of 1000MW. When being put into operation, the project will serve the Jiangsu
power grid, and play an very important role in mitigating the conflict of power
supply and demand of the grid, increasing the level of local industrial and
agricultural production and people's living and promoting the social and economic
development in Jiangsu Province.
1.4. Project & Resettlement Schedule
The preparation period for YPSPP will last 1 year and three months. It was
scheduled to begin the construction work in 2003, and the pre-construction
period will last 3 months. At the end of first 5 years, the first unit will be put
into operation, the other 3 units will be put into operation in the sixth year, thus,
the time limit for YPSPP will be 6 years. According to the general construction
schedule, at present, the resettlement planning works have been completed,
and the RAP compiling work is carrying out. Meanwhile, the legal formalities
for land acquisition and housing relocation and the preparation work for
implementation of resettlement have begun. The resettlement works were
scheduled completing prior to the main building construction, and thereafter
the M&E works will be carried out based on the WB's request.
1.5. Measures for Reducing Project Impact
1.5.1. Reducing the Land Acquisition and Housing Demolishing Area
Obviously, the project construction is relevant with the land acquisition, house
demolishing, the resettlement, and will impact the living condition of the local
inhabitant. In order to reduce the number of land acquisition and house
demolishing, during the project pre-construction period, the design institute
(ECIDI), compared and studied on the distribution of permanent project
constructions, construction temporarily using land, and they decided to cancel the
former clay using land, and lessen the original production and living area for
construction, and the area will be changed into project construction temporarily
using land, so as to avoid the residentials' living area, and take cultivated land as
little as possible, especially the fertile farmland. According to the preliminarily
optimized project land requisition scheme, the project occupied land reduced from
the former 4271 mu to the present 3675 mu, especially the permanently
requisitioned land reduced from the former 4064mu to 2612mu, with a high
reducing rate of 35.73%.
5

1.5.2. Reducing the Influences during the Construction
In order to reduce the influence during the construction, follow measures will be
adopted:
1) Enhance basic data acquisition procedures, analyses on local socio-economic
status, and formulate practicable action plans with due consideration of actual
situation, thus ensuring that the standards of living of the resettlers will not be
decreased.
2) Strengthen internal and external independent monitoring activities, establish
highly efficient and smooth channel for information feedback, reduce information
processing period, thus ensuring that problems can be resolved timely.
3) During construction, use of local materials will be given priority as well as local
transportation means and labor force, thus resettlers can obtain benefits from the
project.
4) The project construction will be reasonably arranged during farm slack season
rotate clearance, so as to decrease the project impact on local production.
1.6. Project Design and Review
The station site selection, pre-feasibility study and feasibility study design of this
project is carried out by Shanghai Investigation & Design Institute. Early in the
project pre-feasibility study stage, the design unit have carried out detailed station
site selection planning, and during July 1998 to Jan. 2000, the feasibility study
design was carried out alongside the deep-going technical-economic study, and
conducted alternative comparison in terms of the project impact on local social
economy, land acquisition, housing relocation and resettlement, geological
structure, hydrology and meteorology, topography and geomorphology,
construction  conditions,  large  equipment  transportation,  arrangement,
maintenance after construction and project economic justification, etc. Finally, the
project scheme was determined. During Jan. 6 - 9, 2000, the selected project
scheme was approved by the review meeting hold by China Consultation
Company for Hydropower plant and Jiangsu Provincial Electric Power Company.
The report of the project affection on environment is carried out by ECIDI. After
enoughly collecting local social economic datas and drawing samples by site
survey, about the environment problems appeared during the project construction
or after the project construction, ECIDI carried out possible measures or design
scheme. At present, the project owner is actively preparing the report of the
project affection on environment to the State Environment Protecting Bureau for
approval.
The resettlement planning of the YPSPP is originally organized and led by the
Project Preparation Office and Yixing People's Government, Jiangsu Province.
The Shanghai Investigation & Design Institute is responsible for the technical
aspect of the planning. All the project impact inventory have been approved and
signed by its' owner, and the resettlement plan including new house plot choosing,
resettlement measures etc. were determined fully adopt the resettlers' opinion,
6



RAP of Yixing Pumped Storage Plant
and approval by local government at all levels, during the project construction
designing period, after deciding to get loan from the World Bank, Jiangsu
Electricity Power Bureau again entrusted ECIDI and the project preparing to
construction office, as well as Yixin City PRO checked and studied the RAP,
based on this the RAP of the item was compiled according the World Bank.
1.7. Preparation for Resettlement Planning
1.7.1. Impact inventory survey
Based on the scope of the reservoir inundated and land acquisition for project
construction, in July, 1999, led by the Jiangsu Provincial Electric Power Company,
the Project Preparation Office and the local government at all levels composed a
impact inventory survey group. The group carried out a detailed survey in the
project scope on the project impact inventory including affected population,
demolished houses, acquisitioned land and affected special facilities. In April,
2000, the Shanghai Investigation & Design Institute accompanied by the Project
Preparation Office, carried out a detailed impact inventory check survey, and the
results of project impact were approved by the local government at all levels and
through the reviewing meeting hold by Jiangsu Provincial Electric Power
Company and Jiangsu Planning committee. In June, 201, Yixin Project
Preparation Office, Yixin PRO, Yixin Woodland and Environment Scientific
Protecting Institute as well as relevant cadres, workers from ECIDI carried out a
detailed check on the former inventory data within the scope of the the revised
project land using scheme. The relevant villages or villagers groups participated
the scene checking work.
1.7.2. Social-economic Survey
After the impact inventory survey, in order to analyze the project and prepare a
feasible and practical RAP, an overall social-economic survey, organized by
Jiangsu Provincial Electric Power Company, and taken by the Project Preparation
Office and ECIDI (the consultation unit for RAP compiling) was carried out in Jane,
2000. The survey contents were mainly of the existing social and economic
conditions and the extent of the possible impact induced by the project on the
local social and economy. The survey was carried out by data statistics and site
interview and used the methods of collecting local social and economic data and
local sampling investigation together. The investigation is conducted in two parts:
A. Getting to know basic conditions, social economic statuses and development
plan of the areas influenced by land acquisition, house relocation. Collecting
different data and materials from planning, statistics, prices departments of
local government, including: GNP, national income, gross industrial and
agricultural output value, state revenue, income standards of people's living,
agricultural and sideline products, various price information needed,
agricultural planting structure, farming area, per mu yield, farm land owning
conditions and annual statistical reports, etc to analyze and sort out different
indexes for the local social and economic conditions.
B. Getting to know production and living conditions of the areas influenced by
7



RAP of Yixing Pumped Storage Plant
land acquisition, house relocation: deciding various indexes of the effects of
the project on local production and living standards of residents, and sample
investigating the objects influenced by land acquisition and house relocation.
1.7.3. Resettlement Planning
The resettlement planning of the project is organized by and under the leadership
of the Preparatory Office of Yixing Pumped Storage Power Project and Yixing City
people's government, with the assistance of Shanghai Investigation and Design
Institute under the State Power Company. Based on the impact scope of the
project and actually surveyed inundation inventory and combining the local
conditions of the city, the plan, prepared following the principle of "resettlement
implementation with production development", focuses on guaranteeing the basic
substance for people's living and providing potentials for long-term development.
The living standard of the resettler will reach or exceed that before resettlement
by combining the inhabitant resettlement work with the local economic

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN PROJECT AFFECTED AREA
2.1. Natural Geographical Features
Yixing City is in the West Lake Area of the Taihu Lake catchment area, facing the
Taihu Lake on the east, linking Liyang on the west, connecting Wujin on the north
with the Gehu Lake in between, and bordering Zhejiang and Anhui provinces on
the south. The Yixing area is in the northern sub-tropic monsoon climate zone,
with clear four season divisions. In the area, the climate is warm and humid, with
plenty of rains, long frost-free season, heavy humidity, and sufficient sunshine.
The perennial average temperature is 15.7∞C, the frost period is 42.5 days in a
year on average, and the perennial precipitation is 1241.2mm.
The hilly area in the southern part of Yixing City has mountains extending
undulantly. The topographical conditions are rather complicated, mainly featured
by erosive landform. The slope wash is not thick, the bed load of the river are
mainly composed of quartziferous sand and gravel. The soil in the area is lateritic
soil or sandy loam. The vegetation in the area is good.
The project site is at the southern edge of the Yangtze sub-zone of Yangtze strata
zone, neighboring with the Jiangnan strata zone. In the area, the outcropped
strata are mainly the sedimentary rock stratum of Maoshan group pertaining to
middle/lower series of Devonian system and Wutong group pertaining to upper
series of Devonian system, with granite-porphyry intrusion of late Yanshan period.

2.3. Basic Status of Households Affected by Land Requisition
The land requisition and house relocation for the project affect six units, i.e., Yixin
Forest Farm, Yixing Economic Development Zone, Yixin Environmental Protection
Science Development Zone, Guijing Township, Shanjuan Town and Yixin 173
Microwave Station. Of these affected units, the Yixing Economic Development
Zone, Guijing Township, Shanjuan Town and Yixin 173 Microwave Station will
only be affected by part of their collective-owned forest land, and the land
requisition will no involve privately owned land. In order to have a good
understanding of the impact on the households to be relocated by the project, the
social and economic survey group of the project has selected by random
sampling method 69 sample households within the project affected area (42
households in Yixin Environmental Protection Science Development Zone and 26
households in Yixin Forest Farm), and made a detailed survey on the basic
production and living conditions of the sample households. The sample
households basically covers the whole affected area and have representativeness
of the area, thus, it is deemed that they can be used as the base for project
impact analysis. The location of the sample households is shown in Table 2.3-1
and the basic production and living status of the sample households is shown in
Table 2.3-2.

3. PROJECT IMPACT
3.1. Determination of the Scope of Affected Area
According to the general layout of the project construction and nature and time of
the land to be acquisitioned, the land to be occupied by the project can be divided
into three categories, i.e., reservoir inundated land, permanently occupied land
and temporarily occupied land.
1) The permanent occupied land includes the land to be built with the main and
subsidiary dams, dam of the lower reservoir, switchyard, access road to dam
crest (1# highway), access-road to the powerhouse and power station, roads
around the upper and lower reservoirs, the excavated area for reservoir basin
above the reservoir inundated land, relocated road to the Yixing 173
Microwave Station (2# highway), relocated road to the Transmitting Station of
the Yixing TV Station (7# highway), permanent production and living
management area, 3# spoil area, water replenishing pump station and piping
route, tower basis of transmission line, new plot for Nanyueshi Branch and 173
Microwave Station, etc.
2) The temporarily occupied land area included The highway spoil area beyond
the reservoir, 1 # spoil area, 2# spoil area, temporary construction way,
temporary production and living area for construction, etc. In order to reduce
the impact of resettlement, during the detailed design stage, the project
temporary land occupation were seriously controlled, meanwhile, in order to
control the compensation fee of the temporary land occupation within the
budget, another 120 mu temporary land occupation inventory is added in the
budget which is prepared for future need.
The permanent structure occupied area were margined with the dig line or the
slope feet line, and the spoil area beyond the reservoir were have a reserve
volume within 1Om in height. The land for the piping route will be acquisitioned in
5m width, and 5m width will be for project temporarily using.
Based on the above mentioned principle and referring to the corresponding
1:1000 or 1:2000 topographical maps (1:500 topographical map used for the
water replenishing works), the land to be acquisitioned in the two categories
includesl.742 km for the permanent occupied land and 0.709 km2 for temporarily
occupied land (including 120mu for preparation).
The land requisition for the project permanent and temporarily using is detailed in
Appendix 1------ Map for YPSPP Project Land Acquisition Scheme.
3.2. Project Impact Survey
The survey on the project affected inventory indexes was conducted within the
scope determined by the layout of the project structures and water replenishing
works and the general project construction layout as defined in the Feasibility
Study Report of Yixing Pumped Storage Power Project, and on the three
categories of acquisitioned lands. Thus, the survey was divided into three parts
respectively in reservoir inundated land, permanent occupied land and temporarily
21



RAP of Yixing Pumped Storage Plant
occupied land. The survey in the reservoir inundated land covers Nanyueshi
branch of Yixin Forest Farm, Meiyuan Village in Yixin Environmental Protection
Science Development Zone, Yixing Economic Development Zone, Yixin 173
Microwave Station, that in the permanent occupied land covers Nanyueshi and
Dahanjie branches of Yixin Forest Farm, Yixin Environmental Protection Science
Development Zone, Yixing Economic Development Zone, Yixin 173 Microwave
Station, Shanjuan Town, Guijing Township; and that in the temporarily occupied
land includes the Tea garden of Meiyuan Village in the Yixin Environmental
Protection Science Development, Nanyueshi branch of Yixin Forest Farm,
Dahanjie branches of Yixin Forest Farm.
In order to ascertain the quantity of the land to be acquisitioned, a survey team
jointly organized by the project preparatory office and local government,
sponsored by the Jiangsu Provincial Electric Power Bureau and with the technical
guidance of Shanghai Investigation and Design Institute. In July 1999, the team
carried out the site survey and measurement on the affected objects on the
categorized land village by village and household to household. The survey result
sheets were jointly signed by the households affected and the surveyor. The
survey contents and method are described as follows.
A. Demography: Based on the actual recorded population (both registered or not
registered) of 1999 and natural village as a unit, survey and statistics were
made on the affected population household to household.
B. Cultivated land and tea garden survey: Based on the actual measured
1:500, 1:1000 or 1:2000 topographical map and general construction layout,
the cultivated land and tea garden survey and statistics was carried out by site
measurement according to the ownership and land types.
C. Woodland survey: According to the forest form diagram and forestry data
provided by the Forest and Side-line Project Bureau, the data of the Yixing
Forest Farm is pertaining to 1983, and that of other units pertaining to 1988.
Therefore, the data available could not be directly cited in the survey due to
the long time difference, and the survey output on the woodland had to be
revised based on the actual changes in the past years.
As the Nanyueshi and Dahanjie branches of Yixing Forest Farm have largely
renewed the tree species, and the project affected woodland is mainly in these
two branches, The forestry data within the affected area were rechecked with
the help of Forest and Side-line Project Bureau, and the rechecked area and
tree species in the affected area based on the forest form diagram were sorted
after measured by planimeter.
For the woodland beyond Yixing Forest Farm, as the tree species on these
land have not been changed since 1988, the forest area in the reservoir
inundated area and the permanent occupied land was measured by the
planimeter and the tree species determined based on the the forest survey
date, and the tree species were determined, with consideration of the time
factor.
D Housing and appendages survey: Taking natural village as a unit and based
on the elevation and house types, all the houses in the reservoir inundation
and land requisition scope were measured on site, according to different
22



RAP of Yixing Pumped Storage Plant
structures such as brick-concrete, brick-wood, earth-wood, wood and simple
structure, and then statistics was made.
E. Special facilities survey: The survey on the highways, power and
communication lines and other existing facilities affected by the project was
based on the data provided by the concerning authorities. The survey team
and the representatives of those authorities checked and registered the actual
conditions on site.
In April, 2000, the Shanghai Investigation & Design Institute accompanied by the
Project Preparation Office, carried out a detailed impact inventory check survey,
and the results of project impact were approved by the local government at all
levels and through the reviewing meeting hold by Jiangsu Provincial Electric
Power Company and Jiangsu Planning committee. In June, 2001, Yixin Project
Preparation Office, Yixin PRO, Yixin Woodland and Environment Scientific
Protecting Institute as well as relevant cadres, workers from ECIDI carried out a
detailed check on the former inventory data within the scope of the revised project
land using scheme. The relevant villages or villagers groups participated the
scene checking work.
3.3. Project Affected Inventories
The site survey and statistics show that the main inventories to be lost due to
reservoir inundation and land requisition by the project are as follows.
The permanent land requisition area: includes housing 3921.50m2, tea tree
garden 89 mu, woodland 2269.78 mu, the Huiwu reservoir, simple highway 1.6
km, and 43 persons of 19 households in Nanyueshi branch of Yixing Forest Farm
to be relocated.
The temporary land occupation area: includes cultivated land 29.37 mu, tea
garden 86.66 mu, woodland 931.24 mu (in which 120 mu was used as temporary
land reserve for future need).
The transmission line occupation area: The total length of the transmission line
will be 6.3km, no houses will be relocated and only revolve some land requisition.
Based on the initial design, 8 towers will be constructed, including 6 located in the
forest land and 2 located in tea garden, calculated by 0.3mu per tower, 2.4mu
land will be requisitioned by this purpose, including 0.6mu tea garden (0.3mu
each for Mingnan and Baihe AV) and 1.8mu forest land (all belong to Nanyueshi
branch).
The distribution of the above mentioned losses is as follows.
3.3.1. Land Requisition
The land occupation for the upper and lower reservoirs, main civil works area,
access road to power station, water replenishing piping route and temporary land
use is totally 2.451 km2 (the tower basis not included), including 54.61 mu
cultivated land (in which the temporary occupied were 29.37mu), tea tree garden
175.66 mu (86.66 mu for temporary occupied ) and economic woodland 444mu,
woodland for materials 2080.32mu, mixed woodland 554.9mu, and the other land
246.08mu. The details are as shown in Table follow 3.3-1 and the itemized land

3.3.3. Project Affected Population
The PAPs affected by YPSPP can be divide into PAPs affected by housing
Relocation and PAPs affected by land acquisition. The PAPs affected by housing
relocation are the resettlers whose houses will be demolished, and the PAPs
affected by land acquisition are the resettlers whose contracted land will be
acquisitioned. By survey, 19 households with 43 persons will be affected by the
project housing relocation, 227 households with 506 persons will be affected by
the project land acquisition (19 households with 43 persons will be affected by
both housing relocation and land acquisition). The statistical data of PAPs is

3.4. Project Impact Analysis
3.4.1. Analysis for the impact to the Forest Farm
Yixing Forest Farm is a state-run farm, the project land requisition affects
Nanyueshi and Dahanjie branches of the farm.
The total area of the woodland under original Nanyueshi Branch is 11330 mu,
including forest 10371 mu, (pine tree 4125 mu, fir tree 4496 mu, timber tree134
mu, Chinese chestnut tree 143 mu, bamboo 1152 mu and nursery of young trees
321 mu). The per capita woodland holding of the employees is 150.3 mu. And the
total area of the woodlamd of original Dahanjie branch is 11301 mu, including
forest 9176 mu (pine tree 4978 mu, fir tree 2463 mu, other timber trees 149 mu,
Chinese chestnut 87 mu, bamboo 1279 mu, and nursery of young trees 220 mu).
The per capita woodland holding of the employees is 176.5 mu. Presently, the
Nanyueshi Branch, the Dahanjie Branch, and the other Branch of Dalushi have
been unified, and the new branch is also named Nanjueshi Branch, so after the
unification, the total area of the woodland under Nanyueshi Branch is 34500mu,
and the per capita woodland holding of the employees is 242.9mu. The reservoir
inundation and permanent project structures will occupy 1054.66 mu woodland of
the farm (pine tree 506.91 mu, fir tree 513.21 mu, bamboo 34.54 mu), occupy
economic woodland 404mu (Chinese chestnut tree 143 mu and nursery of young
tree 261 mu), and other mixed wood 62.41 mu, accounting for 4.42% of the total
forest land of the farm branch, the land requisition will not affect the production so
much.
The survey shows that the forest revenue of Yixing Forest Farm is sourced from
the sales of wood and timber, young trees and bamboo. As strictly limited by the
Forest Law and controlled by the forest administration authority. the woods in the
27



RAP of Yixing Pumped Storage Plant
farm should be felled and renewed at certain percentage of the wood reserve of
the farm on a yearly base, therefore, the economic income of the farm is not very
high in a year. For the employees, their family income is mainly sourced from the
sales of young trees and bamboo in their contracted land and certain amount of
maintenance fee paid to them for the contracted land (as wages). Computed on
the basis of total income of the Nanyueshi branches, the project land requisition
will directly reduce 69795 Yuan from the income, respectively accounting for
6.74% and 1.42% of the total of the Nanyueshi branches and whole farm.
Therefore, it can be deemed that the project construction will have a rather small
impact on the Yiaxing Forest Farm.
The survey on the economic conditions of the households affected by the land
requisition and house relocation shows that 35.73% of the family income is
sourced from the forest. And the income from forest accounts for 27.95% of the
per capita net income of the farm employees. Based on this, this construction of
the project will reduce the economic income of the employee's family by 2.4%,
reduce per capita net income of the employee's family by 1.89%. It can be seen
that the land requisition and house removing will impact the employees and the
farm itself to a little extent.

3.4.2. Analysis for impact to the Environment Science Park
The reservoir inundated and permanent land requisition will affect Meiyue village,
Huangtong village and Shanmen village of the Environment Science Park. The
project will permanently requisition 25.24 mu cultivated land from the Environment
Science Park (in which: 6.29mu from Meiyuan village, 7.46mu from Huangtong
village and 11.49mu from Shanmen village), 75.73 mu tea garden from Meiyuan
village (in which, 13.23mu belong to Meiyuan tea factory), 13.27mu tea garden
from Huangtong village, 196.74mu woodland from Meiyuan village, 18.41mu
woodland from Huangtong village. Obviously, the agricultural production and
some villager's economic income will partly be affected by the project.
Huangtong Village
28



RAP of Yixing Pumped Storage Plant
The project land requisition affected cultivated land 7.46mu (of which: paddy
land 3.53mu, dry land 3.93mu), tea garden 13.27mu and woodland 18.41 mu. The
requisitioned land basically distributed in Chaonan, Shangcun, Wanjia, Wangjia,
Hejia and Huangjia, six villager groups. The project requisitioned land accounts
for 1.25% of the total land resource of the village, and accounts for 0.16% of the
total income according to the total economic income structure in 1999, the
affection can be ignored.
Shanmen Village
The project land requisition affected cultivated land 11.49mu in Xiawan villager
group in Shanmen Village (of which: paddy land 10.89mu, dry land 0.6mu), which
accounts for 8.91% of the total cultivated land and garden area, but it only
accounts 0.28% of the total income of the villager group according to the
economic income structure, and the affection can be ignored.
Meiyuan Village
The project will permanently requisite cultivated land 6.29mu (of which: paddy
land 1.81mu, dry land 4.48mu), tea garden 75.73mu, woodland for materials
196.74mu (of which: pine trees 179.92mu, fir trees 15.70mu, bamboo's 1.12mu).
And the project will temporarily affect cultivated land 15.86mu (of which: paddy
land 6.39mu, dry land 9.47mu), garden 86.57mu, woodland 18.57mu.
By the survey, there are 1073mu cultivated (572mu paddy land and 501mu dry
land), 1075mu tea garden (in which, 575mu from Meiyuan tea factory) and
1560mu woodland in Meiyuan village currently. Compared with the income
recorded in the annual report, the land requisition (inclosing land for temporary
use) of YPSPP will reduce 262,200 yuan thousand Yuan from agricultural income,
which accounts for 6.05% of the total agricultural income and 1.15% for the total
economic income of whole village. If the land for temporary use is not accounted,
land requisition will reduce 94,900yuan from the annual income of the village,
which accounts for 2.19% of the agriculture income, and accounts 0.42% of the
economic income of the whole village. In addition, the survey on the economic
conditions of the households affected by the land requisition and house relocation
shows that the household per capita net agricultural income is 1510 yuan, which
accounts for 21.75% of the total household per capita net income. Based on this,
this construction of the project will only reduce the net income of the affected
family by 0.48%. It can be seen that although the land requisition will impact the
agricultural production in a certain degree, but impact the total economic income
and household net income only to a little extent.
From this to analyze group by group, the affection of land requisition on
Shuangmiao Group, Tongguan Group, Huiwu Group in Meiyuan Village, Xiawan
Group in Shanmen Village and Shangchun Group is Huangton Village is great.
Compared by the land area before and after land requisition, it reduces by
13.93%, 11.15%, 23.81%, 8.91% and 9.23% for each. Land requisition affection
little on the other villager groups, after land requisition, land reduces by a rate of
less than 4%. The details are shown in Table 3.4-2.

3.4.3. Analysis for impact to other unit
1) The 173 Microwave Station
The woodland of the 173 Microwave Station in the reservoir inundated and
permanent land occupation area is the state owned land. Due to the 173
Microwave Station did not deal in forestry produce, and there were no income
product form woodland, the land requisition of the YPSPP will not affect the 173
Microwave Station.
2) Yixing TV Station
The construction of the YPSPP will demolish the transformer room (12.96 m2) of
Yixing TV Station near the upper reservoir, and the land requisition of the
project will not affect the TV deliver tower.
3) The Development Zone
163.05mu woodland owned by Chunbu Village of Development Zone will be
requisitioned by the project, which accounts 1.70% of the total 9578 mu woodland
of the village. Based on the income structure of the village 1998, the land
requisition of the project will reduce the forestry income of 3082 yuan, which
accounts only 0.01% of the total agriculture of the village, the affection of the
project to the village is quite little.
4) Guijing Township and Shanjuan Town
The project will permanent requisition 20.29 mu woodland of Tongguan Village of
GuijingTownship and 40mu woodland of Furong Village of Shanjuan Town, all
owned by the village collectives. Due to the number of land requisition is quite
small, the affection to the forestry production of the two village will be too little to
account.
5) Xingjie Town
The transmission line construction will requisition 0.6mu (0.3mu in Baihe AV and
0.3mu in Mingnan AV) tea garden from Xingjie Town. Due to the requisitioned tea
garden all belong to the AV collective, and the amount is reasonably small, so the
affection to the agricultural production of the two village will be too little to
account.

5. PLAN FOR RESETTLEMENT RESTORATION
The planning work of the resettlement for YPSPP (including those for the
reservoir inundated area, areas for permanent structures and temporary use)
was jointly completed in Oct 1999 by the local governments and concerned
responsible departments under Yixing people's Government and Shanghai
Investigation and Design Institute, under the leadership of Yixing People's
Government and the Preparatory Office of the project. Later, the resettlement
plan was modified and perfected by Shanghai Investigation and Design
Institute according to the consulting comments made by the experts from
China Water Resources and Hydropower Engineering Consulting Corporation,
and completed the Resettlement Inundation Treatment and Land Requisition
attachment to the Feasibility Study Report of the project in 1999. In May 2000,
Shanghai Investigation and Design Institute prepared the Resettlement
Inundation Treatment and Land Requisition (Approval Edition) attached to the
Feasibility Study Report of the project according to the approval comments put
forward by the China Hydropower Engineering Consulting Company in
January 2000. In June 2000. ECIDI, the consulting firm for the resettlement
work of the project made the supplementary survey on the social and
economic conditions of the project affected area jointly with the Preparatory
Office of the project and other concerned units, and checked the original
resettlement plan based on the site survey outputs and according to the IBRD
guidelines on the resettlement.

5.2. Policy and Principle of Inhabitant Resettlement
5.2.1. Policy
The resettlement policy for the resettlement work of YPSPP is: The
resettlement work shall be conducted with due respect and consideration to
the local tradition and habit in production and living, with full consideration of
the willing of the resettlers. Based on that the original production and living
mode will not be changed, the effort will be mainly made in resettlement
procedures to develop planting production by using the local land resource
and exploitable natural resource in the original town (ship) and villages, and
concurrently to develop the secondary and tertiary industries in local area.
The inhabitant resettlement shall first be based on guaranteeing the basic
substance and provide possibility for long-term development. The local land
resource shall be fully utilized for development through resettlement, so as to
reach the target of long-term prosperity.
5.2.2. Principles
A. Resettlement planning should be based on the property indexes and
compensation standards to improve, or at least to restore the original
production and living conditions of the resettlers.
B. The resettlement of the project shall be combined with the regional
construction,  resource  development,  economic  development and
environment protection. Considering the actual local conditions, practical
and feasible measure shall be worked out for restoring and developing the
production and living of the resettlers case by case, meanwhile, some
necessary conditions shall be created for self-development of the
resettlers.
C. Planning should be based on the principle "Beneficial to the production and
47



RAP of Yixing Pumped Storage Plant
make the life convenient".
D. Construction scale and standards of the resettlement project should be
guided by the original scale and standards. Investment should be based on
the quota planning. Investment for enlarging the scale, improving
standards and future planning should be treated by the local government
and relative departments.
E. All factors should be taken into consideration. Benefits between the state,
collectives and individuals should be dealt with properly.
F. By adopting the method of paying compensation and granting subsidies in
pre-stage and production support in post-stage, and fully using the local
natural resources, efforts shall be made to guarantee the resettlers
production and living level to reach or exceed the original level before
resettlement.
5.3. Overall Resettlement Scheme
As the construction of the YPSPP will not improve heavy impact on the original
production and living conditions of the affected villages and the forest farm, the
overall resettlement scheme of the project is therefore determined that the PAPs
will be resettled in their original villages (branches) and villager groups, mainly by
land-based resettlement and developing agriculture. The cultivated land and
gardens will be redistributed within the original villages, and the contracted
woodland will be redistributed within the original branches.
5.4. Housing Relocation
5.4.1. Housing relocation plan for Nanyuesi Branch
1) New site choosing
The former site of Nanyuesi branch includs the hostels of the workers and the
other infrastructures, with an area of about 1Omu. Since the branch site is in the
reservoir inundated area, it needs to be relocated. After thorough consideration,
there are two alternatives: one is Baibugang new site, the other is Nanyuesi new
site. The site of the Nanyueshi branch will be relolcated near the access road to
the dam crest about 650m away from the original site, and it is close to the 1#
road on the upper dam, 4.5km from Yixin city, children of the workers go to
Meiyuan primary school 1.5km away. And the site can be expanded widely, after
construction, it has wod\nderful exploring potent if it can get benefit of tour.
Nanyuesi site is on the west of Nanyuesi branch, lies at the triangle belt upper
border of Nanyuesi. The disposal of the houses is restricted by landform, and it is
8.5km from Yixin City. Children of the workers go to the nearest Dajian primary
school 3km away, but it is more convenient to get water than Baibugang new site.
After comparison during the workers' symposia and the discussion with the
leaders of the forest farm, the employees and leaders of the forest farm think
Baibugang is better than Nanyuesi. With agreement of Forest and Side-line
Production Bureau of the county, YPSPP Working Office decide to make the new
site be Baibugang, and they will organize to make study and plan of farther step.
The site survey shows that the host site is the fir tree woodland of the branch. The
planned host site is about 10mu. The branch of Nanyuesi is responsible for
48



RAP of Yixing Pumped Storage Plant
implementation of the housing relocation. The new site location of the Nanyueshi
Branch is detailed in Chart 5-1.
2) Scheme of power and water supply, access road and land leveling in the
new site
A. Land leveling
The host site for the new office building of Nanyueshi branch is gentle in landform,
and the building will occupy a small piece of the land, thus, the leveling work is
small. It is planned to requisite a land area of 10mu for Baibugang site. According
to site reconnaissance and survey, and the requirement that the height of the site
after land leveling will equal the height of 1# road, the highest height for digging
and filling are both about 3.5m, so that the earthwork for digging and filling are
nearly equal. The earthwork for ground leveling is 5775m , the investment is
about 40425yuan according to 7yuan/m3. At the same time, a flood-releasing
trench of 11Om will be built down the hillside at the west of the site, the drainage
ditches of 180m will be built within the site, and a water launching ditch of 110m
will be built outside the site, the investment for these will be about 4800yuan
according to 12yuan/m. Since the site is gentle in landform, it is planned to invest
20 thousand yuan for the protecting projects. So for Nanyuesi branch, 45225yuan
will be invested for ground leveling, and 20 thousand yuan is considered to be
invested on entering road. For ground leveling and the entering road, it is
accounted by 10yuan/m for the budget. The work will be completed during the
construction.
B. Water Supply scheme
After consultation with the forest farm, Nanyueshi branch as well as Yixing forest
and Side-line Production Bureau, the water supply for the new office and new
houses of the employees of Nanyueshi branch will be solved by drilling wells and
pumping. The pumping equipment at the original pumping station will be used in
the host site. The management of the branch is responsible for implementation of
this work, 50,000 yuan will be for this.
C. Power supply scheme
The power supply scheme for Nanyuesi branch after removal will be unitely
resolved by transmission facilities reconstruction scheme. 1000yuan for power
supply facilities of the public parts, and 100yuan per household for the new
workers.
D. Restoration scheme for access roads
The new office building of Nanyueshi branch is only 230m away from the access
road to the dam crest (1# highway). There exists a tractor road in between. It is
not needed to build new road. The road is only needed to be widened and be
paved, the fees of 20,000 for this will be accounted into the budget.
3) New site overall layout
Considering the net structure of the road, a road of 230m will be built north to the
new site to the 1# road, which is upper the dam, and it can connect with the road
around the mountain, and a water piping system of the site as well as the water
launching channel will be configured, a living building and a working building will
be built, behind the living building, a tool house will be built, and behind the tool
house, a piece land of 2mu to 2.5mu will be prepared for vegetables growing
49



RAP of Yixing Pumped Storage Plant
(0.1mu per household), in front of the working building, a ground for wood piling,
and still there is some free land, between which and the working building, there is
a green belt. The plane composition of the planned site is shown I Yixin Nanyuesi
branch layout chart (Chart 5-2).
4) Structure of the newly built houses
Considering the family population of the workers on the forest farm (totally 19
household for relocation, 2 households with 4 persons for either, 8 households
with 3 persons for each, three households with 2 persons for each, 6 households
with 1 person for each), the houses are designed in monocase, with two set types
of middle and small size (map for structure of middle sized type and for structure
of the first floor is shown in Chart 5-3), the main body of the building has three
floors, between three stairs. On the second and third floor, there are 12 sets
(planned to arrange 10 households of 4 persons, 3 persons, and still 2 sets will
remain). On the first floor, totally 9 households of 2 persons, 1 persons will live
separately (mainly for the retired persons), so the houses can satisfy the
resettlement for the relocated households.
The commodity houses are of brick mixture structure, with 2.8m for the height of
each floor, the height of the edge is 8.55m, surface of the house is hung by tile
board and clay level tile, the floor is constructed by concrete or board with holes.
The building is 45.6m long and 12m wide.
The working building is structured by concrete so as to separate during figment.
The building has 4 floors, and it is 40m long and 3.2m wide for each floor, with a
height of 12.95m for edge.
5) Allocation ways for newly built houses
Pricinplely, the allocation of newly built houses will consider the old retired
comrades first, they can decide the housing structure and floor. The convenient
houses on first floor shall be arranged for the old comrades princinpely. The
houses on the second and third floor shall be allocated to the young workers in
service. During the actual work, the allocation work will be decided by
combination of study by the branch and individual discussion.
Telephones and cable TV set: for the households who has got telephones and
cable TV set before, after housing relocation, the branch will fix them unitely, and
they shall not pay for them, if not and they want to fix them, they shall apply for
the approval and they will pay for the work themselves.
5.4.2. Rebuilding of living quarter of the 173 Microwave Station
1) Overall pLan
The existing 173 Microwave Station has its living quarter for its duty staff when
they are on the mountain. This quarter will be relocation due to expansion of the
upper reservoir capacity. The original scheme in the feasibility study report
planned to relocate it to the mountain top about 500m away from the original site
(in the southwest direction). In this design stage, it is decided to relocate the
quarter to the place in front of the station gate after discussion with the station
management. The new living quarter plan is shown in Chart5-4. The management
of the station is responsible for implementation of the housing relocation.
2) Scheme of power and water supply, access road and land leveling
50



RAP of Yixing Pumped Storage Plant
A. Land Leveling
The new living quarter of the 173 Microwave Station will occupy a small piece of
land on an open land. The engineering quantity of land leveling is small, only for
arranging drainage ditch around the buildings. The planned investment can be
based on Nanyuesi farmland, according to 10 yuan per square merters.
B. Water supply scheme
There exist a water well in the living quarter of the 173 Microwave Station, As the
water supply from the well could not be guaranteed, a water supply system was
built including water retaining weir, filtration pond, water pond and pump room.
The water supply system has two filtration ponds, the old one with a volume of
110 cubic meters (which is still in use) and the new one 30 cubic meters (which is
not in use due to leakage). There are two water ponds with volume of 20 and 30
cubic meters respectively. After consultation with the leaders and employees of
the station. It is considered more preferable to build the new water supply system
on the southern side of the highway between the relocated Microwave station and
the TV transmitting tower. The new system will also be composed of water
retaining weir, filtration pond, water pond and pump room. The water volume
gathered system will be built according the criteria, size and function of the
original water supply system. The filtration pond volume will be 140 cubic meters,
the water storage pond 60 cubic meters. As the pump delivery lift height is
increased, the pumping equipment needs to be renewed. The management of the
station is responsible for implementation of this work.
According to the water supply scheme in the 173 Micropower Station and the
living quarter, the fees for the work is 80,000 yuan.
C. Power supply scheme
The power supply to the new living quarter of the 173 Microwave Station will be
incorporated into the rebuilding plan of the power transmission and distribution
plan. The compensation of 1500yuan is only for the restoration of the lines,
equipments within the resettlement site.
D. Restoration scheme for access roads
The new office building of Nanyueshi branch is only 250m away from the access
road to the dam crest (1# highway). There exists a tractor road in between. It is
not needed to build new road.
The new living quarter of the 173 Microwave Station is located in front of the
station gate, where the relocated highway for station (2#highway) passes by. It is
not necessary to solve the problem of traffic alone.
The planned resettlement sites for Jiangsu YPSPP are detailed in Appendix
1 ---Scheme for the project land occupation.
5.5. Production Resettlement Plan
5.5.1. Yixing Forest Farm
The construction of the YPSPP will occupy woodland 1626.34mu of Yixing Forest
Farm (of which: economic woodland 404mu, woodland for materials 1054.66mu,
mixture woodland and the other land 167.68mu), land requisition affected
Nanyuesi branch. So the project impact to the two branches is rather small, the
51



RAP of Yixing Pumped Storage Plant
impact to the income of the employees is even little. After consultation with the
farm management and Yixing Forest and Side-line Production Bureau, the impact
to the employees will be arranged by the farm management with the farm. Yixing
Forest Farm has established the resettlement leading group with the director of
the farm as the group head, and the deputy Party secretary and deputy directors
of the farm as deputy group heads. The group has 6 members. Under the group,
a resettlement office is organized, which is responsible for the daily resettlement
work. According to the actual condition and development requirement of the farm,
the group has worked out a resettlement plan for the farm, in which the contracted
land will be re-distributed combining creation of new nursery of young trees.
The project affected 19 households with 43 persons, of which there are 16 retired
persons (including those worked on the farm), who will get pension every month
as before, so their income will not be affected by housing relocation. On the farm,
there are 24 workers, of which 15 persons contacted bamboo garden, 9 persons
contacted chestnut garden. Those who contacted bamboo garden or chestnut
garden get income mainly from contact, and they can also get income by working
during the free time, the management persons get income mainly by wages, and
those who get remarkable results will get prize through examine in the end of the
year. Moreover, there are three students who are studying at school. The former
Dahanjie branch has been merged into Nanyuesi branch in April, 2001, no
relocated persons, so there are 12 households with 28 persons in Nanyuesi
branch.
5.5.1.1. Resettlement scheme
The project land requisition involved 31 households with 71 persons in Nanyuesi
branch. Since land requisition from woodland for materials has no direct affection
on the income of the workers, so land requisition from economic woodland and
bamboo only involved 15 workers, of which 9 persons contacted with chestnut, 6
persons contacted with bamboo. The details are shown in Table 5.5-1.

5.5.1.2. Nursery construction scheme
Planting young trees is one of the main production item of Yixin forest farm, they
have wonderful skill on this and they can get reliable benefit from this. The project
construction will affect the wood production of the forest farm, and also provide
the farm chance and fund for structure adjustment. To take better advantage of
the chance, get a better connection between production opening and resettlement,
Yixin Forest Farm has planned to open a nursery of 317.1mu in the middle of
Dingzhang road, 200m on the west of Qingshuitan Farm. After put into operation,
the nursery will be used mainly for resettlement for the affected workers on the
farm branch.

RAP of Yixing Pumped Storage Plant
For the 317mu nursery, it needs 5 years to be put into operation, that's it can get
benefit since 2006, according to the selling price of 30yuan per pole, so 250300
poles will get 7,509,000yuan. Counting by the using time limit of 20 years for the
nursery (4 years for production period), the project investment of the prime stage
(including reservoir, ground leveling, pipes, irrigation facilities and roads) is 1290
thousand yuan, and 157,780,000yuan for wages and investment on young trees
of every period, the yearly interest is 6.21 %, the total investment for the 20 years
(the production time limit of nursery) is 554.370,000yuan, the total output value is
1496,310,000 yuan, and the gross profit is 941.940,000yuan. Detracting the fees
for selling (20% of the production vlaue) 299.260,oooyuan and wages for workers
(5% of the production value) 74.810,000yuan. So that the pure income of the
production period is 567.870,000yuan, considering the changing during the 20
years, meanly, Nanyuesi branch can get a pure income of 47.410,000 yuan from
the nursery (selling price of the year, the pure income is 1495yuan per mu), which
is much higher than the yearly loss of 69,795yuan caused by land requisition.
5.5.2. Yixing Environmental Protection Science Zone
The project construction will requisition 25.24 mu cultivated land (6.29 mu in
Meiyuan Village, 7.46 mu in Huangtong Village and 11.49 mu in Shanmen
Village), 75.73 mu tea tree garden of Meiyuan Village (including 13.23 mu in
Meiyuan tea tree farm), 13.27 mu tea tree garden of Huangtong Village, 196.74
mu woodland of Meiyuan Village, and 18.41 mu woodland of Huangtong Village.
The temporary land occupation of the project will be 86.57 mu of tea garden of the
Meiyuan Tea Tree Farm (of which 4mu is from collective). The project land
requisition will affect 435 persons of 196 households (336 persons of 153
households in Meiyuan Village, 72 persons of 31 households in Huangtong
Village and 29 persons of 12 households in Shanmen Village) of the Environment
Science Zone. From the analysis of the project impact in the chapter 1I1, we can
see that although the land requisition will affect the agricultural production of the
Meiyuan village in a certain extent, the affection to the total economic income of
the village and the yearly household net income is very little, and the affection to
the Huangtong village and Shanmen village is too little to account. After the
project Preparatory office full consulted with the Yixing People's Government and
Environment Science Zone Management Committee, a resettlement plan was
worked out by the Environment Science Zone, and a leading group of the
resettlement with members of 5 persons headed by the deputy leader of party
committee also be established by the Environment Science Zone, the labor force
arrange office was organized under the group, which is responsible for the daily
resettlement work of this project. The resettlement plans of respective villages of
Environment Science Zone are described as below.
A. Meiyuan Village
The project construction will permanently requisition 6.29 mu cultivated land
(include 1.81mu paddy field and 4.48mu dry field), 75.73 mu tea tree garden
(include 62.50mu contracted by villagers and 13.23mu owned by the Meiyuan tea
factory) and 196.74mu woodland (include 179.92mu owned by the villager
collective and 16.82mu contracted by the villagers) of Meiyuan Village. The land
requisition will affect 7 villager groups and the data of land requisition of each
group is shown in Table3.4-2. By statistics, there are totally 1073mu cultivated
land, including 572mu paddy field and 501mu dry field (which has been changed
56



RAP of Yixing Pumped Storage Plant
into tea garden), 575mu tea tree garden owned by the tea factory and 1560mu
woodland (include 437 directly owned by the villager collective and 1123mu
contracted by the villagers) currently. The per capita land owning and the land
amount of each group of Meiyuan Village before land requisition is shown in table
3.4-2.
It can be seen from the comparison in Table 3.4-2, of the project affected 7 village
groups in Meiyuan Village, the land per owning amount hardly changed except for
Shangmiao, Tongguan Group and Huiwu Group (for Shangmial Group, it reduced
frome 0.98 mu to 0.84 mu, for Tongguan Group, it reduced from 0.68 permu
before land requisition to 0.60mu and from 0.86mu to 0.66mu for Huiwu Group).
In addition, according to survey, of the planting output value in the village groups
in Meiyuan Village, the output value of tea garden take a great proportion (take
1998 as an example, the planting output value of the village is 2,458,500 yuan, of
which output value of tea garden is about 1,220,300 yuan, accounting 49.6% of
the total). Based on this, the project working office, Environmental Protection
Science Zone and the cadres in Meiyuan Village had full consultation with publics
widely, according to the different opinions to resettlement manner, the following
manners are provided for the villager group to choose.
Scheme One
(1) Land adjustment in the village. After land requisition, for the groups whose
cultivated land and tea garden reduced, Meiyuan Village will allocate to the
affected groups as the same quantity of requisitioned land, so as not to change
the cultivated land area or tea garden area of each group. Meiyuan Village
originally had tea garden of 575mu, 13.23mu for project permanent land
requisition, 4mu for project temporary occupation, it still has collective tea garden
557.77mu, after land requisition, the village can still allocate land to the affected
groups. At present, Meiyuan has already defined the plots and area of tea garden
for adjustment. It is shown in Table 5.5-8.

(2). The village should allocate from collective land of the same area to the village
groups Those village groups whose woodland reduced after land requisition.
(3). Re-distribution cultivated land in the groups, so as to keep the balance of the
per capita land owned.

(4). After land requisition, the relevant compensation will be paid to Meiyuan
village based on the state and local governmental policy. According to the initial
plan of Meiyuan Village, the compensation and subsidy for cultivated land
requisition will be distributed directly to the affected groups, the young crop
compensation also will be distributed to the individuals directly, and other
compensations will be managed by the village committee, the using of this
compensation shall be approved by all villagers or villager representatives, and
supervised by the Environment Science Zone.
2. Scheme Two
(1). Re-distribution cultivated land in the groups, so as to keep the balance of the
per capita land owned.
(2). After land requisition, the relevant compensation will be paid to village groups
based on the state and local governmental policy, since there is no mechanism of
financial affairs in the village groups, according to the initial plan, all the land
compensation except that compensation for young crops will be paid to
individuals will be managed by the village collective in name of village groups. All
the villagers in the groups will decide the using channel and amount, and will be
supervised by     the upper government---the Environment Science Zone. The
using of the fund will be decided by the villagers, such as for endowment
insurance, hospitalization insurance, or for production development, for example,
some villagers are willing to take the advantage of being near to Yixin City, taking
some cultivated land or garden for developing vegetables in big sheds. For this,
the planning group take detailed analysis for the investment and output of growing
vegetables in big shed, which is shown in Table 5.5-9.

3. Scheme Three
(1). Re-distribution cultivated land in the groups, so as to keep the balance of the
per capita land owned.
(2). After land requisition, the relevant compensation will be paid to village groups
based on the state and local governmental policy, and the village committee will
take responsibility of allocating the fund to the individuals in the villlage.
The three schemes above are for the village groups to choose during the
implementation.
B. Huangtong Village and Shanmen Village
As the quantity of land requisition of Huangtong and Shanmen villages is quite
small and the affection of land requisition to this two village is very little, after
consultation with two villages, the resettlement of land redistribution in the groups
and compensation owned and managed by the groups was worked out.
C. Plan for Huiwu reservoir compensation
The requisition of Huiwu reservoir will cause 700mu paddy field in the
downstream area lost the irrigation water resource. After the project preparatory
office full consulted with Meiyuan Village, a resettlement plan of cash
compensation combined with water providing was worked out. The cash
compensation was 366000 yuan, and the irrigation water will be provided by
construction water during construction period and by Water conveyance system
after construction. The cost of water providing will be list in the main structure
budget, the fees for resettlement will not be listed.
5.5.3. Resettlement plan for Development Zone, Guijing Township and
Shanjuan Town
The woodland to be requisitioned of the Development Zone, Guijing Township and
Shanjuan Town was owned by the villager collectives. After land requisition, the
special plan for resettlement will not be adopted, and the compensation for land
requisition will be distributed to the villages directly, the using of the compensation
shall be approved by all villagers or villager representatives.
5.6. Re-cultivated plan for temporary land using
The construction of the project will temporarily occupy 1063.38 mu land of
different sorts, and it is mainly used as the construction ground, storage ground
and remains landfill. According to the construction schedule, the temporary land
occupation period will be 4 years. During construction, the annual production
value will be paid by the owner yearly. After construction, the project owner will
take responsibility of entrusting relevant units to manage the restoration work, the
economic loss during the restoration period will be paid by the owner yearly
according to the length of the restoration period.

5.7. Restoration Plan of Special Facilities
5.7.1. Plan for transportation restoration
A. Restoration of the productive road of Nanyueshi Branch
Part of the productive road of the Nanyueshi Branch will be broken due to
reservoir inundated and the construction of the project. In order to restore the
productive conditions, combined with the plan of the access tunnel and the
construction tunnel to the powerhouse, the site workshop, office and the living
quarter, a highway around the lower reservoir levels from 86m to 100m is planned
to meet the demand of the forestry production.
B. Restoration of the access way of the TV Delivering Station and 173
Microwave Station
The only access way of the TV Station and 173 Microwave Station will be cut
down by the upper reservoir. In order to restore the communication to the outside,
it is planned to exceed the highway access to upper reservoir (1#highway) to 173
Microwave Station (2#highway) and TV Delivering Station (7#highway), the
exceeding length is about 1.47km.
The design of the access way scheme for the TV Delivering Station and 173
Mircowave Station will be smoothed during the design of the access way for the
upper reservoir and lower reservoir project by the specialties.
5.7.2. Restoration Plan for the Transmission Facilities
A. Restoration Plan for the Transmission Facilities of Nanyueshi Branch
Farm
Due to inundated affection of lower reservoir, power supply facilities of Nanyueshi
Branch Farm will be dismantled, and it will be restored in new farm site.
In this plan, original 10kV transmission lines of Nanyueshi Branch Farm will be
rebuilt by removing lines with 0.8 pole * km long, and line type will be adopted by
LGJ-120, spanned by concrete pole. Based on unit price in final accounts of
reconstruction project of rural electric grid, provided by Power Bureau of Yixing
City, 120 thousand yuan per pole - km was calculated by flat spanning, so 96
thousand yuan will be paid. In addition, original 5OkVA transformer will be

B. Restoration Plan for the Transmission Facilities of TV Delivering Station
and 173 Microwave Station
There were 2 transmission lines for power supply for TV Delivering Station and
173 Microwave Station, one is 10kV lines from Economic Development Zone of
Yixing City up-to transformer-room between TV Delivering Station and living
quarter of 173 Microwave Station along main channel of upper reservoir via Jingle
Hotel, then distributing to TV Delivering Station and 173 Microwave Station
respectively, currently, this line is main distribution line for two units, named "East
Line"; the other is also 10kV lines from south hill-down along Shanjuan Town
direction up-to transformer-room nearby the living quarter of 173 Microwave
Station, then distributing to the two units with high-voltage cables, currently, it is
used as standby power resources of the two units, named "South Line"
60



RAP of Yixing Pumped Storage Plant
Part lines of "East Line" will be occupied by upper reservoir and 1 " spoil area, and
transformer-room of "South Line" is located within caving cope of exceeded
capacity of the upper reservoir. Based on design principle of "Original Standard,
Original Scale and Original Function", the two transmission lines will be rebuilt.
According to consultation with Power Supply Bureau of Yixing City and
Distribution Office, original "East Line" will be climbed up to the hill along ridge so
as to avoid construction areas of the project, and connected with new-built
transformer-room of TV Delivering Station, then divided into two lines: one will go
to TV Delivering Station directly via transformer, the other will connected with
transformer of 173 Microwave Station with a high-voltage cable along 7# highway,
with service for 173 Microwave Station and its living quarters. The end part of
"South Line" will be connected with transformer-room of 173 Microwave Station,
then divided into two lines, one will serve 173 Microwave Station and its living
quarters and the other will be connected with the transformer of TV Delivering
Station with high-voltage cable along 7# highway, serving TV Delivering Station.
Rebuilt 10kV transmission lines will adopt line-type of LGJ-120, and cables with
70mm2 of three-phase section. Original transformers of the two units will be used
as transmission facilities of new power supply system. After the lines being rebuilt,
"East Line" still will be used as main power resources of 173 Microwave Station
and TV Delivering Station, while "South Line" as standby power resource, so that
the two units will have power supply model of "One Main One Standby".
Tongguanshan belongs thunder region, "East Line" will be stricken by thunder
easily due to it going up hill along ridge, so measures of insulation and
anti-thunder for the Line will be taken, and work of electrical grounding will be
done so as to ensure power supply safe. In addition, both "East Line" and "South
Line" will lay high-voltage cables between 173 Microwave Station and TV
Delivering Station along 7# highway, so, during construction of 7# highway, cable
channel or culvert will be prepared beside the highway for convenience of
construction of cables laying.
According to the plan, the total length of lines rebuilt will be 2.0 pole *km, including
1.8 pole * km for "East Line" and 0.2 pole * km for "South Line". Total investment
cost will be 360 thousand yuan calculated on unit price of 180 thousand yuan of
10kV transmission line for hilly spanning. High-voltage cables will lay about 500m
length unilateral, and bi-directional about 1000m, calculated on 21Oyuan/m of cost
of material and laying, total investment cost is 210 thousand yuan. Transportation
fees of distribution facilities of the two units will be calculated on 5000yuan.
5.8. The rehabilitation plan for the transmission line construction
Due to the impact caused by the land requisitioned of the transmission is very
small, the rehabilitation plan will mainly be cash payment for the land requisition
and trees cut.
The land compensation fee will be similar as that of Pumped Storage Plant, thus
12216 yuan per mu for forest land and 17454 yuan per mu for tea garden. So
totally 32,500 yuan was calculated for this purpose.
In addition, in order to meet the requirement of the line construction and final
operation, 5000 trunk of trees will be cut, estimated by 20 yuan per trunk
averagely, 100,000 yuan will be cost for this purpose.

5.9. Clearing Plan for Reservoir Basin
The project is pure pumped storage power plant, water in upper reservoir and in
lower reservoir will use in circles, in order to ensure reservoir capacity, water
quality and reduce loss of water in reservoir, the basin of upper reservoir was
designed with impervious protective surface using as asphaltum concrete, and
lower reservoir laid gravel, thus it can be seen that demand of main structure will
be higher than that prescribed in Design Specifications for Reservoir Inundation
Treatment for works of reservoir basin clearing, so that the special design about
reservoir basing clearing will not need. Reservoir basin clearing will be carried out
by main structure.

The Reservoir Bottom Clearing-Up fee shall be determined based on actual need.
E. Compensation for specialties will follow the pricinple of "Three Original,
(original scope, original standard, original function)", and the compensation will be
based on the function restoration.
6.3. Compensation Standard
6.3.1. Compensation Standards of Land Acquisition
6.3.1.1. Compensation for project permanent requisitioned land
The land using of this project will involve two aspects, the collective land
requisition and state land adjustment. According to the consultation meeting held
by Land Requisition Office from Jiangsu State-owned Land Resource Hall, Yixin
City Land Administration Bureau, Yixin PSPP Preparation Office, land
compensation standard for the project will be the lowest based on the Land
Administration Regulations of Jiangsu Province. and the calculation of the
compensation for the state woodland using is similar as the collective land
requisition, but the annual output value is set as 1000 yuan per mu. Thus:
A. Standards for Land Compensation
(1) Cultivated land compensation
Based on the first item in Article 26 of "Land Administration Regulations of
Jiangsu", for cultivated land, land compensation will be 8 to 12 times the mean
output value of the three years before land requisition, so compensation standard
for the project will be 8 times the mean output value of the three years before land
64



RAP of Yixing Pumped Storage Plant
requisition. For the mean output value of the three years before land requisition, it
is accounted by Article 26, Compensation will be 18,000yuan if the mean output
value of the three years before land requisition is less than 18,000yuan per
hektare, that's the cultivated land yearly output value is 1200yuan/mu at least.
(2) Compensation standard for tea garden, chestnut garden and nursery
Based on the first item, Regulation 3 in Article 26 of "Land Administration
Regulations of Jiangsu", for garden or the other economic woodland, land
compensation will be 8 to 12 times the mean output value of the nearby cultivated
of the three years before land requisition, so compensation for the project will be 8
times.
(3) Woodland land compensation standard
Based on the first item, Regulation 4 in Article 26 of "Land Administration
Regulations of Jiangsu", for garden or the other economic woodland, land
compensation will be 6 to 10 times the mean output value of the nearby cultivated
of the three years before land requisition, but the output value of the project
requisiitoned woodland is far from the output value of the nearby cultivated land,
so after consultation by the project working group and Land Requisition Office
from Jiangsu State-owned Land Resource Hall and relevant land administration
departments, it is defined that the standard for the project requisitioned woodland
is 6 times.
(4) Compensation standard for the waste land
Based on the first item, Regulation 5 in Article 26 of "Land Administration
Regulations of Jiangsu", for the waste land, land compensation will be 6 to 10
times the mean output value of the nearby cultivated of the three years before
land requisition, so for the project, compensation standard for the waste land is
three times.
B. Resettlement subsidy
(1) Based on the second item, Regulation 1 in Article 26 of "Land Administration
Regulations of Jiangsu", Subsidy for requisitioned cultivated land shall be
based on the area. If the cultivated land per capita for agriculture residents of
the unit is more than 1/15 hektare before land requisition, subsidy shall be 5
times the mean output value of the requisitioned cultivated land; if less than
1/15 hektare, based on 6 times, subsidy shall add a time for every 1/150
hektare, but no more than 15 times mean output value of the requisitioned
cultivated land. According to the realism that the tea garden in Meiyuan,
Shanmen and Huangtong Villages are changed from dry land, after
consultation, during the course of subsidy, the cultivated land per capita is the
sum of the tea garden per capita of the three villages, which are 0.97mu per
capita, 0.69mu per capita, 1.01 mu per capita. So subsidy for resettlement for
the three villages is 6 times, 9 times, and 5 times the mean output value of the
three years before land requisition.
(2) Subsidy standard for tea garden, woodland, chestnut garden and nursery
Based on the second item, Regulation 2 in Article 26 of "Land Administration
Regulations of Jiangsu", Subsidy for the other requisitioned agriculture land,
subsidy will be 70% of the compensation..
65



RAP of Yixing Pumped Storage Plant
(3) Subsidy for waste land
Based on the second item, Regulation 3 in Article 26 of "Land Administration
Regulations of Jiangsu", No subsidy for wasteland and the land owned by
collective by not for agriculture, so no subsidy for the project requisitioned
other land.
C. Compensation standard for young crops
Based on the third item, Regulation 3 in Article 26 of "Land Administration
Regulations of Jiangsu", Compensation for young crops shall be the output
value of a season, and no compensation for those can be harvested in time.
Fees for those crops, flowers that can be replanted shall be compensated; for
those can not be replanted, they will be bought or compensated reasonably.
(1) Compensation for young crops
According to the actual two-rape cultivation in the project affected land, it is
temporarily diffident that compensation for this is half of the yearly output
value, 1200yuan/mu every year, the actual compensation criteria can be
defined according to practicality, 500yuan/mu for winter crops and
700yuan/mu for summer crops.
(2) Compensation for young crops on the tea garden
Of all the project occupied tea garden, only 13.27mu is from Huangtong
Village, used for piping line, the other is from Meiyuan Village, so
compensation for this is based on taking the mean output value of the three
years before land requisition as the yearly output value of the tea garden.
According to the tea production of Environment Science Park, 550 thousand
yuan for 485mu of Meiyuan tea factory, 1134yuan per mu, so compensation
standard for the young crops of tea factory is 1134yuan/mu.
(3) Compensation for woodland
Based on item 2, Article 22 of "Jiangsu Province 'Forest Law of People's
Republic of China' Implementation Regulations", the yearly accountant for
Yixin forest farm, the production, land area of fruits and the other relevant
datas, which are provided by Yixin City Side-line Bureau, the reservoir
inundation, project land requisition and the yearly output value of the forest
land were adjusted, according to the calculating method, the criteria for the
four items of occupied forest land is shown in Table 6-1. Of which fees for
forest cover restoration is not counted into land compensation and
resettlement subsidy, but into relevant tax.

RAP of Yixing Pumped Storage Plant
Later on, the project resettlement office and the resettlement offices at all levels
will further publicize the resettlement policies and encourage the public
participation by the following ways:
1. Making publicity of the resettlement message
The inventory indexes of the affected households will be publicized before
payment of compensation so as to receive the supervision of the resettlers.
2. Making publicity of the resettlement polices
The resettlement polices will be publicized before compensation so as to receive
supervision of the resettlers.
3. Prepared an information booklet
The resettlement office prepared an information booklet of resettlement conditions
to ensure the persons in the affected region and local government to know the
details of the resettlement plan. The project resettlement office rectifies the
message relating to the resettlement and makes it publicity in the affected areas
by posters or broadcasting. The resettlement message includes main contents of
resettlement plan, compensation and relocation policies, and the right of resettlers,
ways of opinion feedback and appeal.
4. Holding Meeting
Public meeting will be held to explain relative policies, laws and rules and
compensation standard extensively so that people can know it early before the
implementation of the land acquisition and house relocation.
9.1.3. Participation in Implementation of RAP
The resettlers will participate in the whole process of implementation of the RAP.
A. Participation in House Reconstruction
1. Housing compensation criteria: The compensation criteria for housing will
directly affect the interests of the resettlers. Before the houses relocated, the
relevant resettlement authority will consult and sign an agreement with the
resettlers on the compensation criteria for the houses. The consulting results will
be declared publicly before the agreement signed, so as to put the resettlement
under public supervision.
2. Resettlement house sites and house reconstruction: During the
preparation and compiling of this RAP, the relevant unit has carried out a survey
on the house relocation site and construction mode. According to the survey, most
of them are willing to have their houses relocated in planning new sub-Forest
Farm and half of them were apt to rebuild their house by themselves. The local
governments at all levels will give a helping hand at different stages for house
relocation.
3. Disposal of Old Houses: All the old houses to be relocated will be
compensated at replacement cost. Within a specified time period, resettlers can,
on their will, demolish their old houses first and then rebuild the new houses or
95



RAP of Yixing Pumped Storage Plant
vice-versa. The salvageable material from the old houses can be used by
resettlers themselves without deduction from compensation.
B. Participation in Production Rehabilitation
The land adjustment and redistribution will be participated by all the affected
individuals.
C. Participation in Using Land Compensation
The land compensation will be paid to the village and shall not be carved up or
used for other purpose. The compensation will be used in a planned way and for
specific items planned. The use of the money will be approved by the villager
congress and under the supervision of the villager representatives.
D. Participation in Project Construction
The project construction will cause certain impact on the local community. In order
to ensure the PAPs to get benefit from the project construction, the local people
will be encouraged to take part in the construction, and favorable conditions will
be created to use local materials and local labor force.
9.2. Responding to Grievance and Appeal
Although the public participation is always encouraged in the process of compiling
and implementing of the RAP, There will be some unforeseeable problems
occurring in the process. In order to solve problems effectively and ensure the
project construction and land requisition to be carried out successfully, a
transparent and effective appeal channel has been set up respectively for rural
resettlement, in addition to the existing appeal method through People' Letter
Office of the local government at all levels. The procedures are described as
follows:
Stage 1:
If any resettler is aggrieved by any aspect of the resettlement, he/she can appeal
to the village committee and the township (town) resettlement office in oral or in
written form. If an oral appeal is made, the village will record it on paper and
process it. Village committee or township (town) resettlement office will make
decision on or resolve it in two weeks.
Stage 2:
If the aggrieved resettler is not satisfied with the decision in stage 1, he/she can
appeal to the PRO after receiving the decision; the PRO will reach a decision in
two weeks.
Stage 3:
If the PAP is still dissatisfied with the decision of the PRO, he/she will appeal to
the civil division of a people's court according to the civil procedural law after
receiving the decision of the PRO.
The resettlers can appeal on any respect of the resettlement, including
compensation criteria. The organizations accept the appeals and grievance of the
96



RAP of Yixing Pumped Storage Plant
PAPs free of charge, and the expenditure occurred there-from will be paid by the
PRO under project contingency.
The resettlers will know their right of lodging appeal during participation in the
public meetings and by other ways. At the same time, the appeal processes will
be publicized among the PAPs through media. The relative authorities will sort out
the opinions and proposals of the PAPs and the resettlement offices at all levels
will process the information in a timely and effective manner.

Contents of the symposia:
First of all, Comrade Guo Zhineng introduced the general situation of the project,
and showed two resettlement sites for the representatives to choose, first is the place
of 20mu nearby Nanyuesi, the other is Baibugang, which is about 100m from the
former living area. Nearly all the representatives chose the second scheme, their
reason is that the first resettlement site is far away from Yixin City area, and with loud
noise from the temple, the second site is near Yixin City, and is close to the station,
so that it will provide favorable condition for the future development of three
productions.
The resettlers have nice understand inwardly on the project, and show they were
in favorable of the state construction, and believe government will resettle them well.
Some of old persons prefer to build bungalow, the reason is they can cook with
firewood, but the flatlet is generally not convenient for this, what's more, they have
some agricultural tools. But after meeting, during consultation with them, they agreed
with the arrangement of the higher level at last. The main reason that did not agree to
build flatlet is that they felt worried about the payment difference. Several old
comrades said that they will take out 800yuan every month for medicine, and they
don't have economic ability for house building, and they hope the forest farm can
take it into consideration. And they wanted a house of the same area with now, but no
more payment. All the resettlers said they would like to build houses unitely.

Contents of the symposia:
Now their income is mainly from tea selling, the vegetables they planted are for
themselves.
They requested that if the project needs labours, the local villagers should be
considered first.
They wanted to be compensated in cash (they think they can get more than
30,000yuan per mu in cash), and they did not need land. Even that they thought after
the leaders paid compensation, the things later are up to themselves. (but we must
explain to them from polices that the land compensation must be used specially for
production development, improving people's living level, and we must carry out
concrete production development scheme or the other measures.)
In the afternoon, we also went to Tang Lianming's house, the specialized
household, to see the analysis on cost of production under awnings:
