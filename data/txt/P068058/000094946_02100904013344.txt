Chapter 1
Introduction to the Project
1.1   Introduction
This section of the report provides an overview of the project and its objectives, and
identifies the main benefits and adverse impacts that are expected to accrue if the
project proceeds.
1.2   Background
The Jiangsu Government, in association with the Jiangsu Provincial Electric Power
Company (JPEPC), proposes to implement the 1000 MW Yixing Pumped Storage
Project (YPSP). The project will be located in the south of Jiangsu Province, just
west of Tai Lake, near the borders of neighbouring Anhui and Zhejiang provinces (see
Figure 1-1).
The YPSP is a water resources development project consisting of two small reservoirs
(one lower; one upper), and an underground power generating/pumping station. As
a pumped storage facility, the project will be designed to generate power during daily
periods of peak electricity demand, when energy can be sold at a premium, by using
the water stored in the upper reservoir. The water collected in the lower reservoir
will then be pumped back up to the upper reservoir, during periods of the day when
cheap energy can be bought from the east China power grid. A 6.3 km double
circuit 500 kV transmission line will be constructed as part of the project for wheeling
power out to the 500 kV Liyang Substation, which connects to the east China power
grid, and to receive off-peak power with which to pump water back up to the upper
reservoir.. Two 35 kV transmission lines (5 km from Taodu Substation; 10 km from
Yixing Thermal Power Plant Substation) will be constructed to bring power from the
grid into the 35 kV YPSP Substation, which will be constructed near the lower
reservoir. This power will be used initially for supplying electricity to the upper and
lower reservoir construction areas and, later during operation, to provide electricity to
the powerhouse facilities and auxiliary operations.
Jiangsu is one of the most economically developed provinces in China, and its power
supply system is the most important part of the entire east China power grid. At
present, the Jiangsu provincial power supply system is totally dependent on thermal
generating  plants for electricity  generation.  Because of their operating
characteristics, thermal plants do not provide for good peak energy regulation.
There is considerable concern that the current dispatching and operating system is
unable to meet the increasing demand for peaking power, and that safe and stable
operation of the system will soon be at risk. To solve the problem of regulating peak
energy demand in Jiangsu Province and the east China power grid, the Government of
Jiangsu Province has determined that it is necessary and feasible to build the Yixing

Pumped Storage Power Project. The contribution that the YPSP will have on
regulating peak demand in Jiangsu Province, once the project is fully operational (i.e.,
by 2010) is illustrated the diagram included as Appendix A.
1.3   Basis for Environmental Assessment
As a requirement of both the Government of China and the World Bank, an
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) report must be prepared for the YPSP.
The project has been assigned a Category 'A' rating under the World Bank's
environmental screening process. The following World Bank environmental and
social safeguard policies have been triggered by the project:
* Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01, BP 4.01, GP 4.01);
* Involuntary Resettlement (OD 4.30); and
* Safety of Dams (OP 4.37, PB 4.37)
The Bank requires that the EIA be prepared in both the Chinese and English
languages, and that the EIA meet both Chinese and World Bank EIA requirements.
Where Bank funding is involved in any part of the project, the EIA must cover all
project components, including transmission lines.
A draft EIA report (Chinese language version) was prepared by the East China
Investigation and Design Institute (ECIDI) and State Power Corporation (SPC), as
part of the feasibility studies, and submitted to the Jiangsu Environmental Protection
Bureau (JEPB) for approval in January 2000. The JEPB convened a panel of
experts, which met over a two day period (25 and 26 January 2000) to review the
draft EIA. Formal approval of the draft EIA report was provided by the JEPB on 05
September 2000.    Environmental specialists representing the World Bank
subsequently reviewed the draft EIA (English language version), dated November
2000, in early December 2000, and provided detailed review comments. The draft
EIA (English version) was revised and resubmitted to the Bank as a final draft EIA in
May 2001. Further Bank review of this document produced additional comments,
which were addressed by ECIDI and SPC in the final EIA dated September 2001, and
submitted to the Bank in November 2001.
The EIA report takes into account the entire spectrum of potential project-related
environmental effects on the bio-physical and socio-economic environments within
the project setting.  The EIA   identifies the existing environmental and
socio-economic conditions that could be affected adversely or beneficially by the
project, identifies potentially significant impacts, and recommends measures for
mitigating the more serious negative impacts. The EIA also suggests measures for
enhancing beneficial impacts, where a small additional investment would yield
environmental returns.

Summary EA Report - Yixing Pumped Storage Project
1.5   EIA Methodology
1.5.1 Data Collection and Field Investigations
An environmental survey of the project area and its surroundings was initiated in
April 1998.  Yixing Environmental Monitoring Station was entrusted to provide
water quality monitoring data for surface water sources and drinking water wells
within the project affected area. A survey of terrestrial animals, plants and fishes
inhabiting the project area was completed, and the local experts in these fields were
consulted.
1.5.2 Methods of Analysis
Qualitative assessment methods were used to determine the extent of potential
impacts on water quality downstream of the lower dam and within the diversion area,
as well as for determining potential impacts of the project on the ecological
environment within the project area and surrounding vicinity.  Impacts were
determined for both the construction period, as well as for the operations and
maintenance period
The impact on the reservoir water quality was predicted by quantitative analysis using
a mathematical model.
The effects of release of chemicals (i.e., PAHs) into the water from the asphalt facing
of the upper reservoir was determined by comparing the proposed project with similar
analogous projects that have been constructed and are now operational.
1.5.3 Agency Input and Public Consultation and Disclosure
During preparation of the environmental impact assessment, the State Environmental
Protection Agency and the environmental protection bureaus at different levels
supervised the work according to the current relevant Chinese laws, statutes and
regulations.
During the project site selection and design phase, the opinions of various
government departments were solicited, and specialists from different fields (e.g.,
engineering, environmental, economics) were invited to evaluate and comment on the
feasibility study report, and the design alternatives.  The local project affected
people (PAPs) and social groups were interviewed and meetings were held.
Questionnaires were developed and used to obtain opinions from PAPs as part of the
public consultation process. The project was publicized in the local newspapers, and
radio and television programs. At the same time, the EIA Report for the project was
made available for public review and comment in the offices of the local
environmental protection authority. The availability of the report was advertised in
the local newspaper, and people were invited to review and provide comments.

Summary EA Report - Yixing Pumped Storage Project
1.6   Project Impacts
1.6.1  Benefits of the Proposed Project
The primary benefit of the project is that it will improve the capability of the largely
thermal-based electricity generating system to respond to peak load demands, by
shifting 2000 MW of load to the off-peak (valley) load periods of the day. This will
greatly alleviate peak regulation operation of Jiangsu's thermal power plants, improve
unstable frequency conditions in the system and, overall, improve the quality and
reliability of the power supply system in the east China grid. This will result in
spin-off socioeconomic and environmental benefits, including avoided emissions
from additional thermal generation.
Localized benefits of the YPSP include employment opportunities that accrue from
project construction, and operation, and creation of a local tourist attraction and the
jobs that go with it.
1.6.2 Negative Impacts
The proposed YPSP is expected to generate the following negative impacts:
• Resettlement and Losses from Reservoir Inundation - A total of 757 people will
be effected by the project. Of these, only 44 persons, from 19 households will
be involuntarily resettled. The other 713 persons will lose some or all of their
cultivated land or forestry land as a result of expansion of the lower reservoir,
construction and inundation of the upper reservoir, construction of the power
plant and substation facilities, and construction of the resettlement village needed
to house the 44 displaced persons. An estimated 3,174 mu (211.6 ha) of forestry
plantation, representing only 0.53% of plantation forest, will be removed from
production at the Yixing Forestry Farm. Approximately 71.32 mu (4.75 ha) of
tea farm and 23.59 mu (1.6 ha) of farmland will be permanently lost. Another
97.62 mu (6.5 ha) of tea farm will be temporarily occupied during the
construction period.
Approximately 61 mu (4.1 ha) of fish aquaculture area (i.e., lower reservoir at
Huiwu), will be removed from production. This facility currently only supports
one retiree of the Yixing Forestry Farm (who will be compensated), and produces
only 0.00075 to 00125% of the fishing output in Yixing.
*  Impacts During Pumped Storage Facilities Construction - Construction zones will
be established at the damsites for both the upper and lower reservoir, as well as at
the power/pump house facilities and the main YPSP 500 kV substation.
Vegetation (primarily cultivated coniferous forest plantation) will be cleared from
these construction zones.  Trees of merchantable quality will be sold.
Otherwise the vegetation will be piled and burned. Soils will be removed and
stockpiled for later site restoration. Sites will be leveled by clearing and blasting
to make way for materials storage yards, equipment maintenance and fabrication

Summary EA Report - Yixing Pumped Storage Project
yards, rock quarries and aggregate processing facilities, concrete and asphalt
batch  plants, temporary  construction  camps  and  offices, transformer
substation/switch yards.  Waste rock and excess surficial material will be
deposited in spoils dumps, which can present their own mass wasting and surface
water course sedimentation problems if not properly designed and constructed.
Construction debris will also be generated as a result of building the project.
Strong vibrations caused by excavation activities, particularly drilling and blasting
have the potential to damage or disrupt service to the nearby Yixing TV
Transmitting Station, and the Yixing 173 Microwave Station. Noise and dust
generated by such activities as blasting and excavation, aggregate processing, and
transporting materials may cause disturbance to the residents of Meiyuan village,
located near the lower reservoir.
Exhaust gases from the asphalt batch plant have the potential to create localized
air quality problems around the upper reservoir area. Although there are no
residents in this area, workers and the local environment could be affected, if
appropriate emissions controls are not incorporated in plant operation.
*  Transmission Line Impacts - The two single circuit 35 kV transmission lines and
one double circuit 500 kV transmission line will be constructed over forested
mountainous terrain. The two 35 kV lines will have a total length of 17 km, and
will require 91 steel lattice towers. A total of 0.58 ha of land will be required to
accommodate the tower foundations. The 500 kV line will require 45 steel
lattice towers that, in total, will occupy 0.27 ha of land. A total of 4,660 trees
(approximately 200 tress/km) will be cut to provide space to construct the tower
foundations, and provide safe line clearance distances along the rights-of-way for
the 35 kV and 500 kV transmission lines. Electromagnetic interference of the
TV and Microwave stations is not considered an issue, as both of these stations
are located outside the zone of EMF disturbance.
*  Impacts During Operations Period - Because both the operating levels of the
upper and lower-reservoirs will vary considerably over the course of a given day,
it will not be safe to use the reservoirs for swimming, fishing or boating.
Therefore, the reservoirs will be closed to the public.
Makeup/balancing water will be piped approximately 7 km from Tuanjiu Lake, to
make up for losses from seepage and evaporation from the two YPSP reservoirs,
and to compensate for loss of the pre-project irrigation waters that were provided
from Huiwu Reservoir (i.e., the lower reservoir). Although the water from
Tuanjiu Lake is of slightly poorer quality than the waters of the existing lower
reservoir, it is still meets the standards for irrigation use. The asphalt liner of the
upper reservoir will prevent seepage losses that could affect wells located
downstream from the upper reservoir. Initial releases of polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons will occur during initial inundation of the upper asphalt-lined
reservoir. However, due to the volume of water involved and the dilution effects,
this transient impact is not considered to be significant. Drinking water wells,
- 7 -



Summary EA Report - Yixing Pumped Storage Project
located downstream of the lower reservoir are considered to be located far enough
from the reservoir so as not to be affected by seepage from it.
1.7   Recommended Mitigation Measures
To reduce or eliminate negative impacts generated by the Yixing Pumped Storage
Project, a total of 37.989 million RMB Yuan will be allocated for developing and
implementing environmental protection and mitigation measures, carrying out
environmental monitoring and providing environmental training to project staff.
These costs are in addition to the costs of the resettlement program. Mitigation
measures will include the following:
* Relocation and Protection of TV and Microwave Stations - The TV transmission
tower will be relocated and the TV and microwave stations will both be
strengthened to protect them from damage during the period of construction when
drilling and blasting are carried out nearby.
* Environmental Measures During Construction of the Proiect - Environmental
protection measures will be implemented for liquid and solid waste management
from construction camps, aggregate, concrete and asphalt processing facilities,
and materials storage, fabrication and equipment maintenance yards. Actions
will be undertaken to ensure good housekeeping practices are followed during
construction. Dust and emissions control measures will be implemented for
activities generating these noxious substances, including siting certain operations
away from human settlements or environmentally sensitive areas. Measures to
control or minimize noise will be implemented, including restricting the hours of
the day when particularly noisy activities are allowed.
A plan has been developed for clearing and sanitizing the two reservoirs. The
plan provides direction on vegetation removal, removal of human-built structures,
and sanitizing pit latrines, pig sties, etc. Since the only human development
currently within either of the two reservoir inundation zones is that of the Yixing
Forestry Farm camp and offices located adjacent to the lower, Huiwu Reservoir,
most of the reservoir clearing activities will involve removal of vegetation.
Upon completion of the construction phase of the project, contractors will
demobilize by removing materials and equipment. The temporary work sites
will then be cleaned of all debris, leveled, and restored by replacing soil and
planting vegetation. All non-recyclable debris will be disposed of in the local
Yixing landfill.
* Environmental Measures During Project Operation - To minimize the number of
fish that could be damaged or killed when makeup water is pumped from the
Huangtong River arm of Tuanjiu Lake into the lower YPSP reservoir, fish screens
will be installed at the intake to the makeup water pumping station. To protect
members of the public, the upper and lower YPSP reservoirs will be closed to
swimming, angling and boating, and signs will be placed around the reservoirs

warning of the dangers to personal safety.
* Preparation of an Environmental Management Plan - An EMP has been prepared
which identifies the key impacts, how they will be minimized during construction
and operation, the parties responsible for implementing the mitigation measures,
monitoring  activities  and  responsible  monitoring  authorities, reporting
requirements, institutional requirements of the environmental program, budget for
labour and equipment, and scheduling.

Project Description
2.1   Introduction
This section of the report provides a brief description of the Yixing Pumped Storage
Project and its various components.
2.2   Geographical Location of the Project
The Yixing Pumped Storage Project (YPSP) is located in the Tongguanshan
mountains in the southwest corner of Yixing, southern Jiangsu province. The lower
reservoir of the project is about 8.5km away from  Yixing urban area.  The
geographical location of the power project is shown in Figure 1-1.
2.3   Primary Purpose of the Project
Upon its completion, the primary purpose of the Yixing Pumped Storage Power
Project will be to provide for peak regulation, valley filling, spinning standby,
frequency regulation and condenser operation in Jiangsu provincial power system,
which makes up part of the east China power grid.
2.4   Project Composition
The Yixing Pumped Storage Project is composed of three main parts - (1) water
storage/power generation/pumping facilities, (2) makeup/balancing water supply
works, and (3) transmission lines. Table 2-1 provides a summary of the key features
of the project. More detailed information is available in Appendix B, as well as in
the feasibility report.
2.4.1  Power Generation/Pumping Facilities
The proposed YPSP will have an installed capacity of 1000 MW (4 x 250 MW),
which makes it a large (Grade I) power project under the Chinese power project
classification system. Its major structures are Grade I and secondary structures are
Grade III.
The water storage/power generation/pumping facilities are comprised of the upper
and   lower   reservoirs,  underground   penstock  tunnels,  powerhouse,
switchyard/substations, and access roads inside and outside the project site.
The upper reservoir is located in a gully near the top of Tongguan Mountain on its
north side. It consists of the main asphalt-faced rockfill dam, an auxiliary dam and
the surrounding hills. A road presently runs around the proposed location of the
upper reservoir.

The lower reservoir will be located at the foot of Tongguan Mountain on its northeast
side, and will be constructed by expanding the existing Huiwu reservoir. This will
be accomplished by increasing the height of the present dam and excavating the
existing reservoir. A road presently runs to the Huiwu Reservoir.
The water conveyance system will consist of two parallel 1129.03 m long
underground penstock tunnels, 6 m and 4.8 m in diameter, respectively arranged
inside the mountains between the upper and lower reservoirs. These two penstock
tunnels will divide to form four penstock tunnels, each 3.4 m in diameter, which will
convey water to the powerhouse turbines. The underground power/pump house will
be situated in a cavern located roughly midway between the upper and lower
reservoirs, and approximately 320 m below ground. Water leaving the power house
will be conveyed by four tailrace tunnels, each 183.33 m in length and 5 m in
diameter, which will then combine to form two parallel 1453.56 m long, 7.2 m
diameter tailrace tunnels. The ground switchyard will be located on relatively flat
ground at the top-of- slope above the main transformer cavern.
Connecting to the project site will be 12.54 km of new permanent access highway.
Another 6.96 km of roads will be constructed within the project area.
The general layout plan of the water storage/power generation/pumping facilities is
shown in Figures 2-1 through 2-4.

Summary EA Report - Yixing Pumped Storage Project
2.4.2 Makeup/Balancing Water Supply Works
The makeup/balancing water supply works will be constructed to provide water
throughout the construction period and for initial reservoir filling. Once the project
is operational, the makeup/balancing water supply works will provide water daily to
make up for water lost to seepage, evaporation, and irrigation. For construction,
filling and operation, 0.18 m3/sec of makeup water will be required. Another 0.3
m3/sec of water will be required for irrigation purposes, to compensate for loss of
Huiwu Reservoir as a source of irrigation water.
Primary and secondary makeup water pumping stations will be constructed along
with steel pipelines for conveying the water. The Primary makeup water pumping
station will be located on the east bank of Huangtong River, a slow moving arm of
Tuanjiu Lake, on the south side of Donghe Road (Photo 2-1). The secondary
pumping station will be located immediately below the downstream end of the lower
YPSP reservoir. During operation, the primary makeup water pumping station will
be used to pump water out of the Huangtong River, through 3,220 m of 500 mm
diameter steel pipeline, to the discharge pond located just below the foot of the lower
reservoir dam. The secondary pumping station will then be used to lift the water up
into the lower reservoir. The layout plan of the makeup/balancing water supply
works is shown in Figure 2-5. Water volume balance between the upper and lower
reservoir, and makeup water requirements, are shown in Figure2-6.

Summary EA Report - Yixing Pumped Storage Project
2.4.3 Transmission Lines
The YPSP will be served by two 35 kV circuits, which will require that two
single-circuit 35kV transmission lines (total length 17 km) be constructed. One line
will connect a new 35 kV substation to the existing 220 kV Taodu Substation. The
new 35 kV substation will be built near the existing Huiwu Reservoir (future lower
YPSP reservoir). The 220 kV Taodu Substation is located approximately 5 km
south southwest of the reservoir. The second line will connect the new 35 kV
substation to the existing Yixing City Thermal Plant Substation, which is located
approximately 10 km to the northwest. The two circuits will be inter-connected, to
facilitate simultaneous switching, by 2 km of 35 kV transmission line that will run
between a "T" Tap connector located just west of the new YPSP 35 kV Substation, to
the 220 kV Taodu Substation. A total of 91 towers will be required for the two
single circuit 35 kV lines. The proposed route of these transmission lines is shown
in Figure 2-7.
The Yixing Pumped Storage Power Project will transmit power to the 500 kV Liyang
Substation via a 6.3 km double circuit 500 kV transmission line. A total of 45 steel
lattice towers will be constructed.
The 500kV transmission line route will run from the YPSP Substation, which will be
located northeast of the upper reservoir, westward toward Nanshanmen and
Shanhualing, then north to Jinshanwu and west again toward of Zhuposhan, and
finally north over the Nanjing-Hangzhou Expressway and 220kV Yitao I and II
transmission lines to a point just west of Minnan Village of Xinjie Town, where the
Yili Substationis is located.  The proposed route of the dual circuit 500kV
Transmission Line for the YPSP is shown in Figure 2-8.
2.5   Construction Program
2.5.1 Layout of Construction Works
Construction works will be divided into two main construction areas -- upper
reservoir and lower reservoir construction zones. Other minor construction works
will be undertaken outside these main construction zones. The upper reservoir
construction area will be the site of an asphalt batch plant, concrete batch plant, and
three fixed compressor stations. The lower reservoir construction area will contain a
multipurpose fabrication yard, steel pipe assembly and fabrication yard, machine shop,
truck maintenance shop, materials warehouse and storage yard, two fixed compressor
stations, and a concrete batch plant. A construction camp will be built at the edge of
the lower reservoir construction zone.
Approximately 13 km of temporary access road will be constructed to service the two
construction zones. These will be decommissioned following project completion.

Summary EA Report - Yixing Pumped Storage Project
2.5.2 Spoils Disposal Areas
Four spoils disposal sites (shown on Figure 2-9) will be established for the project -
two in the upper reservoir area (3.84 ha, 2.121 million m3 at the foot of the main dam;
and 31 ha, 6.5872 million m3 in Dahanjie Gully); and two in the lower reservoir area
(26.4 ha, 2.714 million mi3; and 0.76 ha, 1.5845 million mi3).
2.5.3 Sources of Materials
Power will be provided to the upper and lower construction zones by 10 kV lines
originating from the 35 kV substation, which will be constructed near the intersection
of Highways #1 and #5.
Construction water will be obtained directly from the Huangtong River via a series of
pumping stations and storage ponds. The water meets Grade III, which is suitable
for industrial/agricultural use, but is not of high enough quality for use as potable
water. Domestic potable water for the construction camp, offices and other ancillary
facilities (on-site cafes/restaurants, etc.), will be obtained via a piped connection to
the nearby Yixing Water Supply Works.
Approximately 1.1308 million tonnes of gravel, and 719,100 tonnes of sand will be
required for the project. The gravel will be purchased directly from the Furongshi
Quarry and trucked 14 km to the lower damsite. Sand will be purchased from
Guangde, Anhui Province.
About 2.1404 million mi3 of rock will be required for the main embankment dams and
1.0595 million mi3 of rock will be required for the secondary embankment dams.
The rock for the primary embankment of the reservoir main dam will be purchased
directly from Nanba-Yushan Quarry, and trucked 25 km to the upper damsite. The
rock for the secondary embankment of the upper reservoir main dam will be obtained
on site from excavated material obtained from excavating the upper reservoir basin,
the intake/outlet structures, underground tunnels, underground cavern, etc. Where
necessary, the supply of this material will be supplemented by rock purchased from
the Ximeiyuan Quarry. The rock required for the concrete faced-rockfill dam of the
lower reservoir will be obtained from excavating the lower reservoir basin and
underground power/pump-house and water conveyance caverns.
Approximately 196,100 m3 of clay is required for the clay core for the lower reservoir
dam. This material will be obtained from the Dongmeiyuan Borrow Area, which is
located approximately 2 to 3 km from the lower reservoir.
About 400,000 tonnes of cement will be required for the project. Cement will be
purchased directly from the Yixing Cement Factory and trucked 15 km to the job site.
Steel, timber and fuel/lubricants will be purchased locally. Explosives will be
purchased directly from state-designated manufacturers.

Chapter 4
Assessment of Impacts and Recommended Mitigation
Measures
4.1   Introduction
This chapter identifies the major potential environmental and socioeconomic impacts
that are expected to result from the Yixing Pumped Storage Project, and presents
recommendations for mitigating these impacts.
4.2   Construction Related Environmental Impacts and Mitigation
4.2.1  Upper and Lower Damsites, and Underground Works
Site Preparation and Excavation
Site preparation work will involve clearing of vegetation, grubbing out roots, removal
and stockpiling of soils, and removal and disposal of overburden at spoils sites. No
quarry or borrow areas will be developed for the project, since rock excavated to
create the underground penstock and tailrace tunnels, power/pump house, and
switchyards will provide rock for processing into suitably sized aggregate. Additional
materials for use in constructing the project (e.g., sand, gravel, cement, bitumen, etc.)
will be imported from existing from nearby sources.
Terrestrial Ecosystem - As noted in Chapter 3, the vegetation within the project area
is cultivated vegetation consistent with forestry and tea plantations. All vegetation
will be removed from the site of the proposed upper reservoir, and from the margins
of the existing lower reservoir to facilitate its expansion. In addition, all vegetation
will be removed from areas within the construction zone in which ancillary facilities
(concrete and asphalt batch plants, works yards, offices, construction camp, aggregate
processing facilities, etc.) will be temporarily established. All vegetation will also be
cleared from areas designated for use as spoils dumps.
As an area that is presently managed for commercial timber and tea production, there
is frequent human activity and human presence within and around the proposed
project setting. Native species of plants have largely been supplanted by plantation
varieties, an action that has lead to a reduction in the level of plant biodiversity in the
area. Lack of rich and varied wildlife habitat, combined with human presence
(including hunting pressure), has contributed to diminished wildlife populations over
the years.
The loss of small portions of forestry (0.78% of the Yixing Forestry Farm) and tea
plantations will not have a significant effect on remaining wildlife numbers. The
relatively small footprint of this project, combined with the varied topography of the
42



Summary EA Report - Yixing Pumped Storage Project
area, which will tend to isolate much of the construction activity from adjacent
forested lands, will help to mitigate impacts on local wildlife. To further protect
remaining wildlife populations, prohibitions against hunting any local wildlife will be
strictly enforced within the construction workforce. Upon completion of the project,
areas no longer required for use by the various contractors, will be restored by
planting with grass, shrubs and trees.
Soil Erosion and Sedimentationi of Watercourses - Clearing and grubbing of the
construction site, and subsequent excavation of surface areas will expose erodible
surficial materials, especially those on steep slopes, to the actions of surface water
erosion. Of particular concern are the slopes of spoils dumps that, if heavily saturated
by monsoon rains, can become destabilized and fail through a process of mass
wasting. In addition to carrying fine sediments, runoff waters from the project site
may also carry oil residues introduced from heavy equipment, and explosives
residues, introduced by the blasting program.
During rainstorm events, sediment and residue laden water from the excavated upper
reservoir project site will enter Dahanjie gully, which extends downslope from the
base of the upper reservoir dam. Introduction of these construction affected runoff
waters into the gully will reduce the quality of water in this ephemeral watercourse,
and will also reduce the quality of water in the wells that are located adjacent to it,
and from which the Jingle Water Company and others obtain their water. It may be
necessary to provide alternate sources of water for the users of these wells, if
monitoring results show that the wells are being negatively affected. Measures will
be employed to minimize the release of contaminated or sediment laden waters into
the gullies located downstream of the upper reservoir construction zone.
To prevent soil and water loss from spoils dumps, the spoils materials will be
contained within rock retaining walls. Masonry drain ditches will also be constructed
around the spoils areas to intercept and divert water away from these sites. The
material itself will be deposited with angles of repose appropriate for the type of
material, to further minimize the chances of slope failure. As part of the process of
expanding the existing Huiwu Reservoir to become the YPSP lower reservoir, the
fine sediments that have accumulated over the years will be removed and placed atop
the spoils disposal sites as cover material. Spoils dumps will then be vegetated with
grass, shrubs or trees towards the end of the project, or sooner, if these sites are not
required as works yards for contractors.
For sections of roads that are constructed through areas that provide poor geological
conditions, measures will be taken to minimize the chance of soil erosion or slope
failure. Measures may include bridges over gullies, anchors, masonry walls, etc.
Drainage ditches will be built along both sides of any project roads.
43



Summary EA Report - Yixing Pumped Storage Project
Existing Structures - Site preparation and excavation in the vicinity of the upper
reservoir will affect both the TV transmission station and the microwave station. The
TV transmission tower is located atop Tonguang Mountain, at the base of a steep
slope, near what will be the upper extent of excavation in the upper reservoir. The
process of excavation may affect the stability of the tower base. Therefore, to ensure
continued service for the TV station, and eliminate the risk that upper reservoir
excavation could lead to collapse of the TV transmission tower, the YPSP will
construct a replacement tower at a suitable nearby location.
Excavation in the upper reservoir area will also affect the lightning/earth ground
system of the TV transmission station and the earth-grounding system of the
microwave station. Both earth-grounding systems run through the area where the
upper reservoir will be constructed. Therefore, the YPSP will install two new earth
ground systems for each station, and install a new lightning rod on the relocated TV
transmission tower.
Because a significant amount of blasting will be required to construct the upper
reservoir, there is some concern that the TV station and microwave station buildings,
particularly their windows and roofs, may be damaged by flying rock. Therefore, the
YPSP will install steel mesh screens over the windows and place straw mats on the
roofs of these structures to protect them. Additional protection will be provided for
the TV transmission station building in the form of a retaining wall, which will be
constructed along the north side of the building.
During blasting events, increased construction supervision will be put in place.
Management and operations staff of the TV transmission and microwave stations will
be informed in advance regarding when explosives are to be detonated, so as to afford
the staff an opportunity to seek safe quarters and to protect their valuable equipment.
The YPSP contractors will provide blast warning and all clear signals, in accordance
with accepted Chinese and international practice.
In addition to damage that can be caused by flying projectiles from a detonation,
damage can also be caused to sensitive TV and microwave station electronic
equipment by blast induced vibrations. Therefore, as part of the blasting program,
YPSP blasting contractors will adopt measures that control the way the blasting is
carried out, thereby reducing the vibration (i.e, ground force acceleration) that could
damage sensitive equipment. This may include minimizing the size and orientation
of the explosive charges, using shaped charges, pre-split blasting and/or differential
initiation of charges, and covering charges with blast mats. Additional measures will
be suggested to the operators of the TV and microwave stations, including isolating
equipment from significant blast vibration by placing vibration dampening pads
under important equipment, reinforcing structures, and monitoring equipment during
blasting operations.

Summary EA Report - Yixing Pumped Storage Project
4.2.2 Protecting Air Quality
Controlling Fugitive Dust
During construction, dust will be generated as a result of excavation activities,
movement of vehicles and equipment, stockpiling of soils and spoils disposal,
blasting, aggregate processing, and concrete manufacturing.  Fugitive dust is
primarily a concern in the dry season, when lack of rainfall and humidity contributes
to the formation of dust within and adjacent to the construction zone. The main
concerns regarding fugitive dust related to: dust accumulation on crops or
ecologically important varieties of vegetation, which can reduce the ability of the
plants to photosynthesize (i.e., plant productivity is diminished); inhalation of dust by
workers or area residents, which can impair breathing and lead to chronic respiratory
disease; and accumulation of dust in camps, residences and offices, which is a
nuisance to clean up and can damage electronic equipment (i.e., office computers).
There are no food crops or critically important native vegetation species of concern
within or adjacent to the proposed YPSP construction zone. The only residents
currently residing in the area, who could be affected by fugitive dust, will be
relocated prior to any construction. Construction workers are the group with the
greatest potential to be exposed to fugitive dust. Dust control measures will be
adopted for the construction site, particularly in the dry season, and will include such
things as spraying water onto dirt roads to minimize generation of dust; spraying
water onto gravel crushing/sorting equipment to reduce dust; requiring truck drivers
to cover their loads of soil, spoils or other loose material with tarps before
transporting material from one location to another; ensuring that the workers who
may be exposed to dusty conditions are equipped with dust masks or respirators; and
mixing concrete in enclosed silos so a to avoid introducing cement dust into the air.
Emissions from Mobile and Non-Mobile Construction Equipment
Stationary and mobile heavy equipment will release gaseous emissions into the
atmosphere during operation. The pollutants are mainly nitrogen oxides (NOx),
carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbons (HC), for gasoline-powered engines, and
these same substances plus suspended particulates, for diesel-powered engines. The
effects of these emissions will be short term and transient, and will occur in a rural
setting away from any major population center. Therefore, the impacts are not
considered to be significant.
Other Sources of Emissions
In addition to emissions released during operation of equipment powered by internal
combustion engines, atmospheric pollutants will also be released in the form of
smoke, when vegetation that has been cleared from the site, is burned, and from gases
released from explosive charges during blasting operations. Given that the area to be
45



Summary EA Report - Yixing Pumped Storage Project
cleared of vegetation is quite small, the atmospheric pollutants contributed by burning
this material is not considered to be significant.
The total amount of explosives required for the project is estimated at 4,930 tonnes.
Surface blasting will be carried out primarily in the vicinity of the upper reservoir
near the top of Tongguang Mountain, an area where there are no residences, livestock
or critical natural habitat, and where gases are expected to quickly dissipate. The
environmental effects of the blasting program are, therefore, anticipated to be
negligible.
The underground blasting program will generate toxic gases in a confined space. To
ensure that workers are not exposed to these toxic substances, a high volume
ventilation system will be installed as part of the advancing underground excavation
works.
4.2.3 Treating Construction Process and Domestic Wastewaters
The construction phase of the YPSP will generate process wastewater from drilling
operations (surface and underground), aggregate washing operations, and concrete
and asphalt batch plant operations. Most of the process wastewater will contain fine
sediment in suspension (e.g., silt and clay sized particles), but may also contain oil
residues introduced from equipment used in construction processes. It is estimated
that approximately 363.6 m3/h (about 0.101m3/s) of process wastewater will be
produced at the peak of construction.
Domestic wastewater in the form of sewage and gray water, will be produced from
construction camps, office facilities and other ancillary operations. The peak total
discharge amount of the domestic wastewater is estimated to be 132.4m3/h (about 0.
37m 3s).
In the dry season, the upper drainage of Huangtong River (i.e., Huangtong Creek
downstream of the lower reservoir) can become dewatered. During construction of
the lower reservoir works, the main component of stream flow in Huangtong Creek
during the dry season will consist of construction process wastewater and treated
domestic wastewater. The total combined process and domestic wastewater input is
estimated to be 0.0893 m3/s.  The primary contaminants and their respective
concentrations are estimated to be CODcr (29.9mg/L) and BOD5 (6.17mg/L). If this
wastewater is not treated before it reaches Huantong Creek, the quality of the water in
this stream course will be significantly diminished.
During construction of the upper reservoir works, the quality of water in Dahanjie
Gully, which runs down the north side of Tongguang Mountain, may be negatively
affected if untreated wastewater is discharged from the asphalt and concrete batch
plants. This would affect water quality in drinking water wells used by the Yixing
Dhanshan Drinking Water Company, and the few local inhabitants that depend on
this source of potable water.
46



Summary EA Report - Yixing Pumped Storage Project
Construction process wastewater will be treated using settling basins to remove the
fine suspended sediments. The treated process wastewater will be released well away
from any surface watercourses. Domestic sewage and gray water will be collected
and piped to septic tanks for treatment. Treated effluent will be discharged to the
Huangtong River. All wastewater (construction process and domestic) will be treated
so that upon release to the receiving environment, the treated water meets the Grade I
specification defined by The Integrated Wastewater Discharge Standard (GB8978-
96).   The characteristics, treatment capacity and treatment method of process
wastewater and sewage produced during construction are summarized in Table 4-1.
The location of the water treatment stations is shown in Figure 3-9.

The following additional specific mitigation measures will be implemented to protect
local water sources:
47



Summary EA Report - Yixing Pumped Storage Project
*   Procedures for safe fuel and lubricant transport, storage and handling, and
emergency spill response;
*   Equipment maintenance procedures will be developed to ensure good
housekeeping practices are carried out when repairing and maintaining
equipment, including acceptable methods for replacing lubricants and filters,
and disposing of waste materials;
*   Effective site supervision and monitoring procedures to enforce water treatment
protocols;
*   Soil erosion and water conservation design measures are implemented,
especially in areas such as the spoils dumps, road cuts, etc., where sedimentation
of water courses damage drinking water sources;
*   Timely collection and disposal of solid construction and domestic wastes at the
Yixing Landfill will be carried out; and
*   Batch plant facilities will be inspected and approved for operation by local
environmental authorities.
The drinking water wells located near the gully leading downstream from the upper
reservoir dam, and adjacent to Dahanjie Gully, will be monitored during the
construction phase to ensure that construction process and domestic wastewaters are
not degrading water quality. If it is determined that the quality of the well-water is
being adversely affected, then measures will be implemented to ensure the drinking
water companies and local residents that rely on these sources of water, continue to
have access to clean drinking water.  Measures could include supplying water
treatment devices to pre-treat the drinking water for the downstream affected water
companies, establishing new wells outside the zone of influence, financial
compensation, etc. The project budget includes an allowance for providing secure
and safe drinking water to these water users.
4.2.4 Disposing of Construction Wastes
Aside from earth spoils material and vegetation cleared from the site, construction
wastes will include waste concrete, wooden formwork, scrap steel, broken brick,
packing crates, waste oil and oil filters, spent lubricating tubes, broken heavy
equipment batteries, broken steel cables, rubber hoses, and a myriad of other forms of
debris. As noted earlier, earth spoils will be disposed of in engineered spoils dumps.
Vegetation cleared from the site will be sold as merchantable timber or used for
firewood. Otherwise, it will be piled and burned. Scrap wood (from forms and
packing crates) will be recycled or used by local area residents for fuel wood. Scrap
steel, heavy equipment batteries and broken equipment will be recycled, as will waste
oil.  Non-recyclable, combustible material will be burned.  While, other non-
48



Summary EA Report - Yixing Pumped Storage Project
recyclable, non-toxic materials, non-combustible materials, such as broken roofing
panels and tiles, broken concrete or broken bricks, will be disposed of in the local
Yixing municipal landfill.
Domestic solid wastes will be produced from the temporary construction camp, and
will include such things as kitchen scraps, plastic bags, bottles, and ash from coal
cooking stoves. Kitchen scraps will be collected by local farmers for use as pig feed,
while bottles and other recyclable items will be sold. Other non-recyclable wastes
will be disposed of at the local Yixing municipal landfill.
4.2.5 Controlling Noise Disturbance
The only residential areas presently within the YPSP site are the Yixing Forestry
Farm village, which is located immediately adjacent to the lower reservoir, and
another ten households located along the main road leading to the reservoir. The
forestry farm village and its forty-four residents will be relocated prior to construction
commencing. Therefore, construction related noise disturbance will not be an issue
for these people. However, construction related noise, including noise generated by
heavy trucks moving up and down the road, will be a potential source of disturbance
for residents of the ten households located along the road, as well as the construction
workers who will reside in the temporary construction camp. Construction activities
will not significantly impact the construction crews and local inhabitants during the
daytime period, when these groups are going about their daily work routines. To
ensure there is no disturbance to these groups at night, no construction work or other
tasks that create noise that would disturb people at rest, will be permitted between
2200 and 0700 hours.
Noise generated by construction activities will primarily affect the upper reservoir
area, where the Yixing TV Transmitting Station and 173 Microwave Station are
located. To meet the noise requirement of indoor working environment, a 3m high
acoustic isolation wall, which also acts as a wall to protect from projectiles during
blasting operations, will be built outside the main equipment building of the TV
transmission station. In addition, all windows of the building will be replaced with
double glazed windows.
Given that the project area is a commercial forestry and tea plantation operation and,
therefore, does not provide significant natural habitat for important species of
wildlife, the construction related noise impacts on wildlife are not considered to be
significant.
4.2.6 Protecting Worker Health and Safety
According to the construction plan, the peak number of laborers that will be
employed on the project is 4,470. To ensure that diseases are not imported into the
project area by the influx of such a large workforce, the YPSP will require that all
laborers undergo a medical health inspection. Those persons deemed to have an
49



Summary EA Report - Yixing Pumped Storage Project
infectious disease, will not be allowed to work on the project until such time as they
can demonstrate they are healthy.
The construction camp dinning room and kitchens will be regularly inspected and be
required to maintain a health certificate. Construction workers will be given health
and personal hygiene training to strengthen their self-protection knowledge. A
hygiene supervision system will be established for the construction zone, and the
hygiene conditions will be regularly inspected. Operators of restaurants and snack
bars located near the construction zone will also receive training on health, hygiene
and safety matters by appropriate authorities.
Workers will be equipped with appropriate personal protective equipment needed to
perform their jobs, in accordance with Chinese State and Jiangsu provincial
regulations.  This includes the use of hard hats, protective eyewear, hearing
protection, dust masks or respirators, safety harnesses, steel-toed safety boots, etc., as
may be required by the specific tasks being performed.
4.2.7 Transmission Line Construction Impacts
35 kV Transmission Lines
The two single-circuit 35kV transmission lines (total length 17 km) will require a
total of 91 towers, for which the foundations will occupy 0.58 ha of land. The lines
will be routed over forested hilly land, and through some residential areas, which will
require relocation of residents. A resettlement action plan has been developed as part
of the overall process of dealing with the issue of involuntary resettlement for the
YPSP.
Compensation will be paid according to national specifications for forestry land
permanently removed to provide for the tower foundations. The tower design chosen
requires only a small foundation footprint, which will cause minimal disturbance to
vegetation and nominal excavation during construction. Land temporarily occupied
for construction purposes will be restored to its original state as the last step in the
construction process.
The 35 kV lines will also cross the Xin-Chang railway and Ning-Hang expressway.
According to the State Environment Protection Administrative (SEPA) Laws for
Electromagnetic Radiation, the electromagnetic field produced by a 35 kV
transmission line is well within the acceptable range for human exposure. Therefore,
no EMF impacts are expected to accrue to any residents who may reside within close
proximity to one of the two proposed single-circuit 35 kV transmission lines. Nor
will there be any radio interference. Using accepted construction procedures for
stringing conductor wire, there will be no disruption to rail or expressway traffic.
50



Summary EA Report - Yixing Pumped Storage Project
500 kV Transmission Line
The 6.3 km dual circuit 500kV transmission line, which will connect the YPSP
Substation to the existing Liyang 500 kV substation, will require 45 towers that
together occupy a total of 0.27 ha of land. The transmission line will be routed over
mountainous and hilly terrain that is presently covered by plantation forest. The
transmission line route and tower designs have been selected to take maximum
advantage of terrain features and geologic conditions, such that the extent of
excavation and tree harvesting can be kept to a minimum.
The transmission line will be sited between 1 km and 1.3 km from the Yixing TV
Transmission Station and Yixing 173 Microwave, which is twice the separation
distance required to ensure that there is no interference to telecommunications
systems, as specified in The Design Specifications of High-voltage Transmission Line
Impact on Radio Station (DLIT5040-95). The transmission line will not run parallel
to, or cross any major communications lines, and will not be within 2 km of any radio
broadcasting station. The routing of the line has also been chosen to avoid any
villages or built up areas, which could otherwise be affected by electromagnetic fields
generated by the line.  Therefore, the 500 kV line will have no effect on
telecommunications systems or local residents.
4.3   Operational Impacts and Mitigation
4.3.1  Reservoir Water Quality
The natural springs and ephemeral streams that presently flow from the very small
catchment area (0.2106 km2) into the lower reservoir, and which will flow into the
upper reservoir (once completed), meet the Grade I water quality standard. However,
initial  reservoir  filling,  and  replenishment  during  project  operation
(makeup/balancing) will require that water be pumped from the Huangtong River arm
of Tuanjiu Lake into the lower reservoir, from where it will be pumped/released
between the two reservoirs as part of normal operation.
During normal operation of the power station, runoff water entering the reservoirs
from their catchment areas, as well as makeup/balancing water pumped into the lower
reservoir from the Huangtong River arm of Tuanjiu River, will introduce small
quantities of suspended sediment (i.e., fine silt). It is estimated that 0.76 g of
sediment per m3 of water will be introduced on average, and that by the end of the
thirtieth year of operation, the sediment accumulation in the reservoirs will not
exceed 42.07g of sediment per m3 of reservoir volume.
The upper reservoir will be surrounded by a paved road, with interception/drainage
ditches located on both sides of the road. Road embankments will be stabilized to
prevent banks from slumping and control surface soil erosion. Road runoff, and
water from adjacent upslope roadside embankments will be collected in the
5'



Summary EA Report - Yixing Pumped Storage Project
interception/drainage ditches and diverted to vegetated surface depressions down-
slope of the upper reservoir, where the drainage waters will be allowed to dissipate.
In addition, an eddy-control beam, concrete apron and sand trap will be constructed at
the water inlets and outlets of the reservoirs to eliminate any possible increase in
turbidity of reservoir water from the operation of the power station
The combined effects of naturally low sediment input, and engineering measures to
stabilize slopes and minimize re-suspension of accumulated deposits, will result in
negligible impacts on the normal operation of the reservoirs or the hydraulic turbines
as a result of reservoir sedimentation.
The entire upper reservoir basin will be covered with an asphalt lining to prevent loss
of water by seepage. It is expected that there will be an initial release of polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) into the waters of the upper reservoir from the asphalt
lining, when it initially makes contact with the reservoir waters. However, the
extremely low residual amounts of these PAHs, combined with the dilution factor
resulting from the large volume of water, will result in negligible effects of PAHs on
water quality. Monitoring results of similar projects, such as the asphalt lined upper
reservoir and dam at the Tianhuangping Pumped Storage Power Project, show that
PAHs are non-detectable once the reservoir is filled. The same can be expected for
the YPSP upper reservoir.
During initial reservoir filling, 70% of the water for both reservoirs will come from
Tuanjiu Lake if filling is carried out in the rainy season, as opposed to 95% if the
filling is undertaken in the dry season. The rest of the water will come from the lower
and upper reservoir catchment areas. During normal project operation, water loss
from the reservoirs from evaporation and seepage will be higher than water inflow
from the upper and lower reservoir catchment areas for much of the year (61.8% of
the time). The mean annual requirement for makeup/balancing water from Tuanjiu
Lake is 522,000 m3, which corresponds to 8.76% of the total storage of the upper and
lower reservoir.
Because the reservoirs will be filled initially using water from Tuanjiu Lake, then
regularly topped up using this same source, the quality of water in both reservoirs will
primarily be a function of the makeup water that is pumped into the lower reservoir
from the lake. The quality of the reservoir waters will, however, be ameliorated by
normal biochemical processes, along with the introduction of rainwater and water
flowing in from the catchment areas.
The water quality of Tuanjiu Lake basically conforms to the Grade III water quality
standard (Environmental Quality Standard for Surface Water [GHZB 1-1999]).
Water quality modeling for the system indicates that CODM, and BOD5 levels for the
lower and upper reservoirs will be higher, initially, than the present levels
encountered in the existing Huiwu (future lower reservoir). However, these levels
52



Summary EA Report - Yixing Pumped Storage Project
will become gradually reduced and will stabilize with time (600 to 800 days), as non-
persistent pollutants degrade through biochemical processes, and water inputs from
rainfall and natural inflow from the catchment areas mediates the effects of the water
introduced from Tuanjiu Lake.  Modeling indicates that there will not be any
significant accumulation of persistent chemicals that could otherwise contribute to
deterioration of reservoir water quality. Overall, it is calculated that the water in the
lower and upper reservoirs, at the end of the stabilization period, will conform to the
Grade I water quality standards (Environmental Quality Standard for Surface Water
[(GHZB 1-1999].
4.3.2 Downstream Water Quality
The power station will be staffed by 242 persons, many of whom will also reside in
staff residences. Sewage and gray water will be produced at an estimated rate of 54.5
m3/day. This domestic wastewater will be treated using septic tank systems, before
the treated effluent is released to the Huangtong River via surface drainage courses.
As noted in Section 3.7.5, some residents located downstream of the Huiwu
Reservoir, but upstream of the Huangtong River obtain their drinking water from
wells. During operation of the project when the dry season flows in Huangtong
Creek are primarily composed of treated sewage effluent from the project offices and
residences, there is the potential for wells located within 30 m of the watercourse to
be adversely affected by these discharges. Therefore, YPSP will undertake a program
of well-water monitoring to determine if the quality of water in any of these wells is
being effected. If it is found that water quality is being degraded, then the YPSP will
provide alternate sources of clean water, including, if necessary, connections to the
Yixing Water Supply Works.
At present, the surface runoff from what will be the upper reservoir catchment area,
flows downslope through a number of shallow gullies, which are bounded by wells.
Once the upper reservoir is completed and is operational, water that would normally
have flowed beyond the upper damsite, will now be intercepted by the upper
reservoir. Because the catchment is so small (0.2106 kM2) the effects on the quantity
of water available to wells located downslope of the upper reservoir will be
negligible. Although the waters of the upper reservoir will be of lower quality during
the period of initial filling and initial operation, due to the large percentage of Grade
III quality water introduced from Tuanjiu Lake, there will be no water quality impacts
on wells located adjacent to the gullies down-slope from the upper reservoir, since
there will be no water releases from the upper reservoir, directly or by seepage,
during operation.
4.3.3 Water Removal for Makeup/Balancing
The maximum diversion inflow during the construction of the power station, initial
storage and normal operation replenishment is about 0.18m3/s. Together with the
53



Summary EA Report - Yixing Pumped Storage Project
additional 0.3 m3/sec of water required to compensate for loss of the Huiwu Reservoir
as a source of irrigation water, the maximum diversion inflow is calculated to be 0.48
m3/sec, which is 1.17% of the mean inflow and 2.59% of the mean flow of the three
jius (lakes) in a low flow year. Removal of 0.48 m3/sec of water for construction,
initial reservoir filling, makeup/balancing during operations and for irrigation use is
estimated to lower the level of Tuanjiu Lake by only 1.94 mm. This will have no
obvious or significant impacts on environmental conditions or on other users of this
body of water.
4.3.4 Aquatic Ecology
The makeup/balancing water intake located on the Huangtong River arm of Tuanjiu
Lake, has the potential to negatively affect resident fish populations. Fish entrained
in the pumped water can be damaged or killed as they pass through the pumps. Any
fish surviving to enter the lower reservoir, would likewise be at risk to being damaged
or killed if they were entrained in the waters that passed through the pumps en route
to the upper reservoir, or the reverse, entrained in waters that flowed back down
through the turbines. Therefore, to protect fish and ensure the safety of the pumps
within the makeup/balancing works, a trash rack and fish screens will be installed at
the Huangtong River intake structure. The trash rack and fish screens will be
maintained to ensure they continue to function as designed.
To facilitate the passage of water to the intake structure, a short section of the
Huangtong River arm of Tuanjiu Lake will be dredged. As noted in a previous
section, most species of fish located in this complex of lakes and canals are common
varieties used in fish aquaculture. There are no rare or unique species of fish or other
aquatic organisms encountered in the affected area. Therefore, dredging of the
channel will not have any significant effects on local fish populations.
4.3.5 Safety of the Dams and Related Facilities
Project Layout and Design - Report by the Special Board of Consultants
A Special Board of Consultants (SBC), comprising relevant technical specialists'
(international and national), was engaged by the Jiangsu Provincial Electric Power
Company (JPEPC) to review key technical aspects of the YPSP, including
engineering geology and geotechnical conditions, upper and lower dam design and
stability, underground waterway and power/pump-house complex, and downstream
conduits. The SBC submitted its first report on 27 May 2001.
In its report, the SBC indicated that the general layout of the YPSP is well adapted to
the topography and geology of the project setting. The SBC commented that the
Jiazheng Pan (Chairman), Fabio Villegas (Vice Chairman), Shaoji Luo, Jingyi Tan, Keming Cao,
Arthur Stukey and Laurie Richards
54



Summary EA Report - Yixing Pumped Storage Project
shape of the main upper reservoir dam is very peculiar, owing to the high fill slope
that will form the downstream face of the dam. The SBC noted that, although the
design is theoretically feasible, differential settlement of the dam would likely occur,
causing face-slab cracking and subsequent escaping of water from the reservoir. The
SBC recommended that for the sake of design improvements, ease of construction
and reduction of hazard, one of two alternative designs should be considered: (1) a
reinforced-concrete faced rockfill dam with reservoir blanket, which would reduce
the height of the downstream fill; or (2) a hardfill dam consisting of a roller-
compacted low-paste material, with a watertight slab covering the upstream face,
which would provide adequate safety factor against sliding. For whichever design is
chosen, the SBC also recommended that adequate compaction and settlement needed
to be achieved as the dam is constructed.
Regarding the lower reservoir dam, the SBC noted that it is of modest height and a
conventional design and, therefore, should not present any technical constraints. The
SBC agreed with the designs developed by the YPSP, but recommended that the clay
or weathered material which will be used for the core of the dam be excavated from
within the reservoir area, rather than from downstream, so as to minimize loss of tea
plantation and lessen environmental impacts.
The SBC concluded that the present layout design for the underground waterway and
power/pump-house complex is feasible and adaptable to the geological conditions,
and noted that the power/pump-house cavern and transformer vault can be safely
supported with rockbolts, mesh-shotcrete, or fibrecrete, provided these areas are
properly excavated.
Regarding the proposed use of steel liners for the upstream pressure conduits and
shafts, the SBC expressed the opinion that this design is overly conservative, and
suggested that only the lower vertical shaft and adjoining lower horizontal tunnel are
likely to require steel liners. Otherwise, the rest of the headrace conduits/shafts can
be safely lined with reinforced concrete or fibrecrete, supplemented with
consolidation grouting. The SBC concluded that the layout design of the downstream
(tailrace) conduits has been well conceived, and agree that it is necessary to line the
tailrace branch tunnel with steel, and the tailrace bifurcation and tunnel with
reinforced concrete.
Slope Stability
The slopes around the proposed upper reservoir are stable, showing no signs of mass
wasting. To prevent seepage losses from the upper reservoir during operation, an
asphalt lining will be installed as part of the construction process. This lining will
further contribute to the already stable conditions of this site.
55



Summary EA Report - Yixing Pumped Storage Project
The slopes surrounding the existing Huiwu Reservoir, which will be expanded to
form the YPSP lower reservoir, are moderately steep, but stable. It is expected that
the slopes will remain stable once the lower reservoir is raised and is in operation.
For both upper and lower reservoirs, energy dissipating devices (i.e., eddy beams,
concrete aprons, etc.) will be installed to reduce turbulence and the potential for
undermining and destabilizing reservoir shorelines.
Reservoir Seepage
According to the geological information, there is a 0.5 m -5 m wide rupture bed and
smaller 0.1 m - 0.2 m wide rupture bed and cracked zone located within the proposed
area of the upper reservoir. The scale of rupture bedding at the lower reservoir is
relatively small and the cracked zone is less than 1 m in width. The primary issue
associated with these ruptures/cracks is reservoir seepage.
As noted above, the upper reservoir will be lined with a layer of asphalt to prevent
seepage losses. Three sides of the lower reservoir are surrounded by hills. Based on
geological investigations, seepage losses are not expected through the underlying
strata. However, there is the potential for leakage around the dam abutments and
along the base of the dam. Therefore, seepage protection will be incorporated as part
of the dam design.
Induced Seismicity
The proposed YPSP is located 50 - 60 km northwest of the Maoshan rupture, an area
of earthquake intensity VI on the Modified Mercalli Scale. Owing to the distance
from this fault, naturally occurring earthquake activity in Yixing is relatively weak.
Both the upper and lower reservoirs will be small holding basins. The difference in
surface loading before and after reservoir filling is relatively small, so small that it is
considered highly unlikely that structure or stability of the existing geological strata
will be affected. Therefore, there is virtually no risk of reservoir-induced seismicity.
The risk of earthquake-induced failure of the lower or upper reservoir dams is also
considered extremely small due to there being no major fault zones in the YPSP area.
4.3.6  Electromagnetic Field (EMF) Impacts
The 500 kV switchyard for the YPSP will be located at 310 masl, on the north side of
the ridge, which sits atop the underground powerhouse. The edge of the switchyard
will be situated approximately 1000 m from the TV transmission station, and 850 m
from the microwave station. This is less than the 1800 m separation protection
distance specified by the national standard (GBJ143-90). However, the ground
elevation of the switchyard is 60m below the top of the ridge, which separates the
switch yard from the TV and microwave stations. The geological strata and mass of
the ridge serves as a natural magnetic barrier between the switchyard and the two
56



Summary EA Report - Yixing Pumped Storage Project
stations. The GIS mode used inside the switchyard has a good shielding effect, which
will eliminate the electromagnetic wave interference on the TV transmission and
microwave stations.
The linear distance between the outgoing line of the switchyard and the TV
transmission station and microwave station is much more than the protection distance
of 500 m specified by national standard (GBJ143-90). Since the ridge is a natural
barrier, signal receiving and transmitting of the TV transmission station and
microwave station will not be affected.
4.4   Social Impacts and Mitigation
4.4.1  Resettlement Program
A total of 757 people will be affected by the project. Among them, 713 people will
be affected when land used primarily for commercial forestry and tea plantation, is
requisitioned for the project. Another 44 persons, mainly staff (and their families)
from the Yixing Forestry Farm, will be involuntarily resettled. A Resettlement
Action Plan (RAP) for the project has been completed. The project construction will
cause little impact on the migrants' living condition and the environment of their host
site. The existing village from which the Yixing Forestry Farm workers will be
relocated is shown in Photo 3-3.
4.4.2 Agricultural Land Use and Irrigation
The YPSP will permanently alienate a total of 348.1 mu (22.8 ha) of agricultural land,
including 308.12 mu (20.1 ha) of tea plantation and 39.98 mu (2.7 ha) of farmland.
Of the agricultural land that will be affected, most is within Meiyuan Village (328.62
mu (21.9 ha) total, including 298.94 mu (19.9 ha) of tea plantation and 29.68 mu (2
ha) of farmland. Another 204.63 mu (13.6 ha) of tea farm belonging to Meiyuan
Village, will be temporarily occupied for construction works during project
construction.  The people of Meiyuan Village will receive compensation for lost
agricultural productivity in accordance with relevant Chinese regulations.  In
addition, lands used for temporary construction works will be reclaimed and
rehabilitated for tea plantation.
At present, the existing Huiwu Reservoir provides 0.24 m3/sec of irrigation water to
the Meidong irrigation area. This will be increased to 0.3m3/s by the YPSP, a
measure that will increase the dependability of the irrigation system beyond its
present capacity. It is expected that the construction of the project will not have any
measurable impact on the agricultural potential of the Meidong irrigation area.
57



Summary EA Report - Yixing Pumped Storage Project
4.4.3 Commercial Forestry
The project (reservoirs and permanent facilities) will occupy 2,171.68 mu (144.76 ha)
of land presently used as commercial forestry plantation, including 1,480.68 mu (98.7
ha) from Nanyuesi Forestry Branch, and 691 mu (46.1 ha) of the Dahanjie Forestry
Branch. This accounts for 14.08% and 7.53% of the total area of these two branches
of the Yixing Forest Farm, respectively. Within the entire Yixing Forest Farm the
removal of forestry production from these two branches of the operation accounts for
only 0.78% for the land area of the entire Yixing Forest Farm. Therefore, alienation
of this land will have little effect on local forest ecology. Generally speaking, the loss
of < 1% of the forestry farm's productive lands, will not have a significant affect on
the operation of either of the two affected branches. However, In accordance with
Chinese regulations, YPSP will compensate the Yixing Forest Farm for loss of these
lands.
4.4.4 Commercial Fisheries
The fishery area of the existing Huiwu Reservoir is 16 mu (1.1 ha). A single
reservoir keeper carries out all fishery work. Varieties of fish propagated in the
reservoir include grass carp, pien fish, crucian carp, silver carp and black carp.
Juvenile fish are introduced into the reservoir from local seed sources every 2 to 3
years, when the previous stock of fish is harvested.  The reservoir produces
approximately 1,000 kg of fish every 2 to 3 years, yielding a profit of 6,000 RMB
Yuan. The reservoir keeper is the sole beneficiary of this revenue. Upon completion
of YPSP, the lower reservoir will be owned by the power station, and  fishing
operations will no longer be permitted in the reservoir. The reservoir keeper will be
compensated for loss of revenue by the YPSP, which has purchased a lump-sum
annuity for him.
Loss of the fish production from the Huiwu Reservoir will represent only 0.00075%
to 0.00125% of the total fish aquaculture output of Yixing. Therefore, the impact on
local fisheries production is not considered significant.
4.5   Other Impacts
4.5.1  Visual Aesthetics and Tourism
Areas that are disturbed during construction will be rehabilitated as the last step in the
construction process. Spoils disposal sites, works yards and other temporary sites
will be leveled and landscaped with trees, shrubs and flowers.  Although no
recreation will be allowed on the two reservoirs, construction of the paved service
road into the upper reservoir area will improve accessibility to the area. The
combination of improved access and the scenic vistas offered from the top of
Tongguang Mountain may stimulate development of a small local tourism enterprise.

Chapter 5
Assessment of Project Alternatives
5.1   Introduction
This section of the Summary EA Report compares two viable alternatives against the
proposed Yixing Pumped Storage Project as follows: 1) do not proceed with the
project (the "No Action Alternative"); and 2) construct a single coal-fired thermal
generation station, with the same installed capacity and power output as the proposed
YPSP, to provide power to the provincial grid.
5.2   Other     Alternative    Energy     Generation     Alternatives     Not
Considered
Nuclear power generation was not considered an option within the project area,
primarily for economic and technical reasons. Neither was solar or wind power
generation considered, primarily because of the inability of these energy sources to
satisfy the primary objective of regulating peak demand.
5.3   The 'No Action' Alternative
If the proposed project is not constructed, the provincial power authority will look to
other sources of generation to satisfy peak power demand. The region is facing
increased power demand, which cannot be satisfied by traditional hydropower
sources, given the nature of the local geography and river morphology and flows.
The only viable alternative aside from the proposed project is thermal power, which
does not facilitate peak regulation.
The following environmental and socioeconomic impacts would likely arise if a
decision is made not to proceed with the YPSP:
Environmental
* Negative   -- if the YPSP is not constructed, then the only viable alternative
is to build an additional 1000 MW of thermal power generation
somewhere within the east China power grid area. The only
viable fuel source for this is coal, which when burned, can
cause significant negative environmental effects.
* Positive   -- not proceeding with the proposed YPSP will save 2,171.68 mu
(144.76 ha) of plantation forestry land (< 1% of the available
forested land in Yixing) that provides some limited habitat to
indigenous species of wildlife.
59



Summary EA Report - Yixing Pumped Storage Project
Socioeconomic
• Negative   -- if the YPSP is not constructed, then public health within the
region could be placed at risk, as the only viable alternative to
meeting the current energy demands during peak periods
would be to construct and operate a 1000 MW thermal
generating station, whose environmental pollutants would
affect a wide area of this heavily populated region of eastern
china.
* Positive   -- if the YPSP is not constructed, then 44 persons will not have to
be relocated, and the livelihoods of another 713 persons, a
portion of whose lands would be requisitioned, would not be
affected.
5.4   Economic Comparison of the YPSP and Thermal Alternatives
On a least cost basis using net present value, the YPSP is estimated to cost 7.36111
billion RMB Yuan, while the cost of an equivalent capacity coal-fired thermal project
would cost 7.97504 billion RMB Yuan. Based on this comparison, the YPSP is the
more attractive of the two alternatives.
5.5   Environmental Comparison of YPSP and Thermal Alternatives
5.5.1  Air Quality Impacts
The YPSP will use electrical energy produced by existing thermal power plants,
during off peak hours, to pump water to the upper reservoir. The annual equivalent
coal consumption to produce this "pumping" energy is 145,700 tonnes per year. A
new 1000 MW coal-fired plant, that would be required in place of the YPSP to satisfy
energy demand during peak periods, would burn an estimated 285,200 tonnes of
coal/year. The respective pollutant discharge amounts for the proposed YPSP and its
thermal alternative is shown in Table 5-1.

60



Summary EA Report - Yixing Pumped Storage Project
It is obvious that the volume of air pollutants discharged by existing thermal plants to
produce "pumping" energy during off-peak hours, is roughly half that of a new coal-
fired thermal plant of the same capacity as YPSP. Therefore, the YPSP will have less
of an impact on regional air quality.
5.5.2 Regional Water Quality Impacts
The 'puming' energy for the YPSP will come from redundant power in the grid
during lower load (off-peak) periods of the day. Therefore, there will be no increase
in the amount of waste discharge water from the existing thermal plants connected to
the grid, from which the YPSP will draw energy, since no additional power will need
to be generated by the existing thermal plants. The only incremental discharge in
wastewater from the YPSP will be that which is produced during construction and
operation, primarily process waters from batch plants and aggregate production
(construction phase) and sewage/gray water (construction and operations phases).
By comparison, a new 1000 MW thermal plant will introduce large volumes of waste
water as new wastewater discharges to the environment during operation. It will also
release wastewater during the construction phase. The YPSP will, therefore, have
considerably lower impact on regional water quality than a new thermal plant
alternative.
5.5.3 Acoustic Environmental Impacts
During the construction phase, the YPSP will create noise disturbance in a localized
area, primarily as a result of drilling and blasting, and heavy equipment operation on
the surface. Underground construction activities will not create any noise disturbance
above ground. During operation most of the equipment that is capable of generating
high noise levels, will be located below ground and, therefore, there will be virtually
no noise disturbance from the project. The only exception is the above ground 500
kV substation, with its actuators, shunt reactors and static "crackle" of high voltage
lines. However, based on current designs for substations in China, which require the
use of quiet equipment and/or installation of noise baffles, the noise disturbance from
the substation will be well within acceptable limits at the boundaries of the substation.
By comparison, the noise generated by a new thermal generating station will be
considerable. Noise from the generators, boilers venting, coal mills, draught fans,
ventilating fans, transfer stations for delivering coal, and cooling water towers, etc.,
will affect the local acoustical environment over a much wider area than the proposed
YPSP.
5.5.4 Regional Ecological Environment
In general, the amount of land occupied by a thermal plant with the same peak
regulation capacity as the YPSP, will be less than that of the YPSP. A new coal-fired
thermal plant would likely be situated on level ground adjacent to a river from which
61



Summary EA Report - Yixing Pumped Storage Project
process and cooling water could be extracted. Assuming that the land on which the
thermal plant would be sited is part of a larger industrial estate, the plant would likely
have fewer impacts on the terrestrial ecological environment than that of the YPSP,
which will be located in more varied forested mountain terrain, and require
inundation of some forested land.
However, during operation, the YPSP will produce orders of magnitude less
wastewater, solid wastes and atmospheric emissions than an equivalent capacity
thermal plant. Therefore, the impacts of the YPSP on the ecological environment
will, over the long term, be considerably less than for a thermal plant alternative.
5.5.5 Solid Waste Impacts
During construction, the YPSP will generate spoils from excavation works, as well as
construction debris, most of which will be reused or recycled. Once operational, the
YPSP will produce virtually no solid waste, with the exception of sanitary wastes
produced from offices and residences on site. No incremental increase in solid wastes
will be produced by the existing thermal plants whose off-peak energy will be used as
"pumping" energy for the YPSP.
A new 1000 MW thermal plant will generate roughly the same amount of
construction debris during its construction, as that of the YPSP. However, during
operations, a thermal plant will produce significant quantities of ash. For a 1000 MW
coal-fired thermal plant, this would amount to 41,900 tonnes/year that must be
disposed of in a land disposal site large enough to contain the ash that will be
accumulated over the life of the facility. The coal ash contains heavy metals that can
affect the surface and groundwater, if not properly contained. The YPSP will,
therefore, have considerably lower impact on regional solid waste generation than a
new thermal plant alternative.
5.6   Comparison      of YPSP     and  Thermal Plant Peak        Regulation
Capacity
The YPSP will have twice as much peak regulating capacity as a single cycle gas
turbine thermal power plant, or a double shift startup/shutdown thermal station
generator, either of which would have to be used 100% of the for regulating peak
demand. The YPSP will have about four times the peak regulating capacity than that
of coal-fired thermal generator, in which 50% of the units are designated for peak
regulation.
5.7   Comparison of YPSP and Thermal Plant Dynamics
With respect to electricity production, pumped storage projects allow for rapid
changing from no-load to full load conditions and back again. Generally, the time
required to go from full-load pumping to full-load generating is less than 400 seconds
62



Summary EA Report - Yixing Pumped Storage Project
(6.7 min), and less than 220 seconds (3.4 min) in an emergency. By comparison, the
speed with which generator load can be increased for various coal-fired thermal plant
generators operating within the Jiangsu power system is 1% - 2% output/min. The
time required to go from generator start to its full-load operation is several hours,
longer in the case of a cold start. For gas turbine generators, the time from start to
full-load operation is 7 to 8 minutes. It is clear that the YPSP will afford much
greater flexibility to address peak demand and emergency power needs than a coal-
fired thermal plant of equivalent capacity.
5.8   Conclusions
Based on the above comparisons of economics, environmental impacts, peak-
regulating capacity, and dynamic response capability of different power stations, the
proposed Yixing Pumped Storage Project is the best of the viable altematives
considered.

Chapter 6
Environmental Assessment
Economic Benefit and Loss Analysis
6.1   Introduction
This section of the report summarizes the social, economic and environmental
benefits and losses that are expected to accrue as a result of the Yixing Pumped
Storage Project.
6.2   Benefits
6.2.1   Economic and Social Benefits
Comparative Investment Cost - YPSP versus Thermal
The YPSP is estimated to cost 4,228 RMB Yuan/kW to construct. When compared
against an equivalent size thermal project, the YPSP is estimated to cost
approximately 494.86 million RMB Yuan less to construct than its thermal power
equivalent.
Reduced Operating Costs and Improved Power System Regulating Capacity and
Reliability
By the end of 1998, all of Jiangsu Province's electricity was generated by thermal
plants, which provide only limited peak regulating capacity.  Thermal power
generation is ideal for providing electricity for base load conditions, but does not have
the ability to quickly adjust to peak load conditions (i.e., peak regulation). During
times of the day when demand falls below base load, thermal plants must continue to
bum fossil fuels to keep the boilers at operating pressure.
Economic losses accrue from having to burn fuel when electricity demands are low,
and to maintain equipment. Economic losses also accrue as a result of problems
created by unstable frequency of the electricity provided to the system during off-
peak periods. This is particularly the case for equipment that can be damaged or
disrupted by varying frequency, such as sensitive electronic equipment, integrated
assembly lines, and heavy-load electric motors.
Operating the YPSP will off-set the need to burn 0.13945 million tonnes of coal per
year. Based on a price of 350 RMB Yuan/tonne of coal, the YPSP will result in a
savings of 48.80 million RMB Yuan/year in the cost of fuel. A comparison of the
operating costs of the YPSP and an equivalent size thermal plant indicates that the
64



Summary EA Report - Yixing Pumped Storage Project
YPSP will cost 130.17 million RMB Yuan/year less to operate than an equivalent
thermal generating station.
Once operational, the YPSP will supply 1000 MW of electricity to the system during
peak-load periods, thereby greatly reducing the peak-regulating burden of thermal
power plants. The YPSP will correct the unstable frequency of the system to a certain
extent. Thus, it can play a role in phase modulation, spinning reserve and emergency
reserve of the system, eliminate the impact of frequency fault within the system, and
improve the quality and reliability of the power supply system.
Economic Payback
The YPSP will use cheaper electricity produced by the thermal plants during that part
of the day when the demand for power is low, to pump water to the upper reservoir,
and produce electricity during the peak demand period of the day, when electricity
can be sold for a higher price. The difference between the price of electricity bought
from the grid during off-peak hours to pump water, and the price of electricity sold
back into the grid during the peak demand hours is a tangible economic benefit of the
YPSP.
The YPSP will generate 1.491-billion kW h of electricity, all of which will be
supplied during the peak demand period of the day. After deducting the cost of
purchasing power to pump water to the upper reservoir, and power lost as
transmission line loss, the annual quantity of power supplied to the power supply
system is estimated to be 1.461 billion kW h per year. Based on a peak demand rate
of 0.832 RMB Yuan/kW h (inferred on the basis of loan payback conditions), the
annual income earned from selling power from the YPSP is estimated to be 1.21531
billion RMB Yuan.
Optimizing Industrial Output
The inability of a thermal generation-based power system, such as that of Jiangsu
Province, to adjust to changes in electricity demand, and the problems caused by
varying output frequency, has required that industries adjust their mode of operation
in an effort to change the demand curve. Rather than operate one, or perhaps two,
production shifts per day, industry has had to go to a three-shift system. The result is
that the lifestyle and quality of life for many workers has been negatively affected.
Triple shift production has also resulted in increased production costs, and other
negative social impacts.
It is expected that, once operational, the improved peak load regulation and improved
quality and reliability of electricity supply (i.e., through improved frequency control)
provided by the YPSP, will enable some factories to reduce the number of shifts.
These factories will now be able to operate without disruptions that are presently
caused by power interruptions, brown-outs, varying frequency, and other reliability
problems. Reducing operations to one or two shifts per day, will contribute to
65



Summary EA Report - Yixing Pumped Storage Project
improved lifestyle and quality of life for some workers, have a positive impact on
taxation, and result in a saving in costs associated with night-shift production.
Potential Tourism Spin-offs
Improved road access to the top of Tongguang Mountain, combined with the presence
of the two reservoirs and their associated landscaped surroundings, may attract local
tourists who are interested to avail themselves of the scenic vistas offered by this
location. Spin-off benefits may also accrue in the form of economic opportunities
that come from providing transportation, accommodation, food services, etc., to
tourists interested in visiting the area.
6.2.2  Environmental Benefits
When compared against a coal-fired thermal generating plant, the operation of the
YPSP will offset the need to mine another 0.13945 million tonnes of coal per year.
Accordingly, operation of the YPSP will offset the discharge of waste gasses (e.g.,
carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxide, and sulfur dioxide), as well as the
slag-ash. Contamination, which would result from transportation and storage of coal,
and transportation and disposal of ash, will be greatly reduced. In addition, operation
of the YPSP will also off-set the long-term negative impacts on the regional water
environment and aquatic ecological environment that would result from discharging
warm waste-water, etc., from an equivalent size thermal plant. Noise impacts that
accrue from operation of thermal plants, would also be off-set by operating the YPSP.
6.3     Losses
The only losses expected to accrue from the project are environmental loses.
Creation of the YPSP upper reservoir, and expansion of the existing Huiwu Reservoir
to create the lower YPSP reservoir, will inundate a small fraction of the Yixing
Forestry Farm, thereby permanently removing an area of commercial forestry
plantation from production. A small area of tea farm will also be lost. Compensation
will be provided in the amount of 30.3532 million RMB Yuan, for the land removed
from production, and to resettle those persons affected by the project.
During construction, the project will generate minor impacts upon the local
environment. To minimize these impacts, and ensure environmental protection and
monitoring measures are implemented effectively, 37.9899 million RMB Yuan will
be provided by the YPSP. This amount can be considered as an environmental loss.
66



Summary EA Report - Yixing Pumped Storage Project
6.4     Conclusions
The above analysis of social, economic and environmental benefits and losses
associated with the YPSP indicates that the environmental, social and economic
benefits of this project exceed the environmental economic losses.

Environmental Management Plan
7.1   Introduction
This section of the report summarizes information on the environmental management
plan (EMiP), including the monitoring program, and institutional structure required to
implement the EMP and carry out environmental monitoring.
7.2   EMP Purpose and Objectives
Chinese environmental laws and World Bank policies require that a program of
environmental monitoring be carried out during construction and operation periods to
identify potential environmental issues as early as possible, and undertake measures
to prevent or mitigate harm to the environment or local residents.
An EMP has been developed for the YPSP in accordance with the World Bank's
operational policy on Environmental Assessment (OP4.01). The purpose of the EMP
is to provide guidance on environmental management and monitoring activities to the
owner, contractors, operators and environmental protection and management
authorities involved in designing, constructing and operating the project. The EMP
delineates environmental and monitoring requirements, identifies organizations and
institutions responsible for implementing various activities identified within the EMP,
defines a budget for EMP activities, training and equipment costs, and provides a
schedule for carrying out the program.
7.2.1  Institutional Roles and Responsibilities
The proposed institutional framework for environmental management for the project
is illustrated in Figure 7-1. The roles and responsibilities of the various parties
involved in implementing the EMP are as follows:
Owner
The owner of the YPSP, in association with the construction contractors, local
environmental protection and management authorities and environmental institutions
within the Yixing area, will establish the YPSP Environmental Management Office
(EMO) for the project. The YPSP EMO will report to the Environmental Manager of
the Jiangsu Province Electric Power Company, the parent company responsible for
the YPSP.
68



Summary EA Report - Yixing Pumped Storage Project
Two full-time environmental specialists will be responsible for coordinating the
environmental protection management activities during project construction and
operation. Specifically, their work will involve the following:
Ensuring that the environmental protection and monitoring/inspection and
quality assurance and control (QA/QC) that make up the core of the EMP, are
implemented effectively;

Contractor
Each of the main contractors (civil, underground, electrical, etc.) will assign at least
one person to perform the role of environmental supervisor for their respective
companies. These environmental supervisors will be part of the YPSP EMO, and will
report to the EMO's Senior Environmental Specialist on matters relating to
environment.  Individually, the contractors' environmental supervisors will be
responsible for ensuring their respective companies implement environmental
protection measures specified in the bid documents or the detailed design drawings,

7.3.2  Operations Phase
In preparation for operating the YPSP, the YPSP EMO will post signs along the roads
and adjacent to the reservoirs waming of the hazards associated with pumped storage
reservoirs, and notifying the public that the reservoirs are closed to public access or
use. The primary hazard for which the public must be made aware is the potential for
rapid draw-down and raising of reservoir water levels, and the risk that persons could
be drawn into intakes or discharge waters. In addition to signs that warn the public
not to venture near to the edge of the upper or lower reservoirs, the YPSP EMO will
also develop and deliver a program aimed at educating local inhabitants of the risks of
venturing within the closed boundaries of the reservoirs.
Environmental management activities for the operation and maintenance phase of the
YPSP are shown in Table 7-2.

7.4    Environmental Monitoring
The environmental monitoring program will include provisions for monitoring
surface water quality, spring and well water quality, noise, air quality, slope stability,
worker health and safety, and health of inhabitants living adjacent to the project,
during the construction phase. This includes monitoring of the construction works
associated with construction of the reservoirs, underground works, roads, transformer
substation, and ancillary works in the core project area, as well as construction works
associated with the 35 kV and 500 kV transmission lines. Once the project moves
into the operations/maintenance phase, environmental monitoring activities will be
reduced to include only surface and spring/well water quality monitoring.
7.4.1  Construction Phase Monitoring
Water Quality Monitoring
In total, eleven water quality monitoring stations will be sampled during the
construction phase of the project. Five of the eleven water quality monitoring stations
will be established to monitor treated effluent discharged from each of five
wastewater treatment systems. Another five water quality monitoring stations will be
established to monitor water quality in the surface water courses, springs and wells
located downstream of the upper reservoir dam, including the following:
74



Summary EA Report - Yixing Pumped Storage Project
* 100 m upstream of the Jingle Active Drinking Water Company's well;
* Jingle Active Drinking Company's well;
* Tonguan Mountain Spring Company's well;
* In the Dhanjie Gully, 100 m upstream of the Yixing Dahanshan Drinking
Company's well; and
* Yixing Dahansan Drinking Company's well
A single water quality monitoring station will be established at the makeup/balancing
water pumping station intake, on the Huangtong River.
Water quality monitoring will be carried out over a period of six years, from
commencement of preparatory civil works, to completion of all construction
activities. Monitoring will be conducted four times per year, with samples being
collected during the wet season, dry season, and intervening (moderately wet/dry
season), respectively, and an additional set of samples being collected during the peak
construction period, in whatever season that may fall. An additional set of samples
will be collected from each of the five surface and spring/well water stations the day
following a heavy rain event, to determine the impacts of construction related runoff
on spring/well water.
Samples obtained from sites where treated wastewater effluent has been discharged,
and from the Huangtong River, will be analyzed as per the guidelines identified in
Tables 1, 2 and 4 of the Surface Water Environmental Quality Standard (GHZB1-
1999). Water samples collected from the surface water courses, springs and wells
located downstream of the upper reservoir will be analyzed as per the guidelines
identified in Water Quality Standard for Living Driniking Water Source (CJ3020-93).
For potable water samples, parameters to be tested for will include pH, suspended
sediment, COD, BOD5, petroleum, permanganate index, total nitrogen, total
phosphorous, fecal coliform bacteria, and TNT residue (from blasting).
Slope Stability Monitoring
During construction, soil erosion and water-borne sediment transport will be
monitored by qualitative means on the exposed cut and fill slopes, including those
along road rights-of-way, spoils disposal areas, borrow areas, and reservoir banks.
This monitoring will be done on a regular routine basis, particularly during the rainy
season, as site inspections are carried out. As part of this monitoring, operation of
soil and water conservation facilities and their running status will be evaluated.
75



Summary EA Report - Yixing Pumped Storage Project
Air Quality Monitoring
Two air quality monitoring stations will be established for the YPSP, one at the lower
reservoir construction camp, the other between the Yixing TV Transmission Station
and Yixing 173 Microwave Station in the vicinity of the upper reservoir. The
parameters to be evaluated will include S02, NO2, CO and Total Suspended
Particulates. Routine meteorological observations will be recorded when air quality
monitoring is being carried out. Monitoring will be undertaken over a period of six
consecutive days, four times per year, roughly once in each quarter.
Noise Monitoring
Ten noise monitoring stations will be established within the YPSP project area. These
will be located in the following strategic locations:
*  At points along the main access road, including within villages situated on the
road;
*  Construction camps;
*  Yixing TV Transmission Station;
*  Yixing 173 Microwave Station; and
* The concrete and asphalt batch plants.
Monitoring will be conducted as 24 hour continuous monitoring, and will be
undertaken once during execution of preparatory works, then twice per year during
the construction phase, with at least one of the two annual noise monitoring events
being carried out during the period of peak construction activity. Noise monitoring
will be carried out in accordance with the Technical Specifications of Environmental
Monitoring (Noise) [SEPA].
Health Monitoring
To protect the health of fellow workers, and to ensure that workers coming to the
YPSP from outside areas do not bring with them diseases that could adversely affect
the health of the rest of the work force, and the local population, each worker will be
required to undergo a health examination prior to starting work on the YPSP.
Periodic follow-up health examinations will be carried out to ensure the workforce
remains healthy. Medicine and inoculations aimed at preventing the spread of disease
will be provided to the work force by qualified medical practitioners.
In addition, public health screening will be carried out on project affected people by
local public health and epidemiological staff as part of the resettlement program.
Appropriate measures will be implemented to protect local inhabitants.

Summary EA Report - Yixing Pumped Storage Project
7.4.2 Operations Phase Monitoring
Once the YPSP is fully commissioned, the environmental monitoring program will be
scaled back to include only water quality monitoring. Water samples will be
collected and analyzed from monitoring stations in the two reservoirs, gullies located
downstream of the upper reservoir, drinking water wells located adjacent to these
gullies, and from the Huangtong River makeup/balancing water pumping station
intake. Samples will be collected six times per year, twice during each of the high
water, mean and low water seasons. Surface water samples will be monitored in
accordance with guidelines set out in the Surface Water Environmental Quality
Standard (GHZBl-1999). Water samples collected from springs and wells located
downstream of the upper reservoir will be analyzed as per the guidelines identified in
Water Quality Standard for Living Drinking Water Source (CJ3020-93). Water
quality parameters monitored during the operations period will be the same as those
analyzed for during the operations phase, with one exception. During the initial
period of impoundment, water samples will be analyzed for polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons (PAHs), a component of bitumen that is used to make asphalt. If no
PAHs are detected for six consecutive sampling events, then this parameter will be
dropped from the list of items for which water samples will be analyzed.
7.5   Data Management and Reporting
The YPSP EMO will establish a data management and filing system to receive and
compile all documents relating to the environmental management program.
Authorities contracted to carry out the monitoring and supervision activities will be
required to submit a monitoring report in a timely manner following each monitoring
event (generally within 30 days). The YPSP EMO will be responsible for compiling
these data into a consolidated project monitoring reports that will be submitted to the
environmental department of the JPEPC, following each monitoring event. On the
basis of the environmental reports prepared by the YPSP EMO, the JPEPC will
prepare an annual environmental management and monitoring report, which will be
submitted to the World Bank for review.

7.7   Proposed EMP Schedule
The YPSP is estimated to require six years to construct. Preparatory civil works to
build roads, a temporary construction camp, and ancillary service facilities will
commence approximately three months following award of the civil works contact(s),
and will take one year to complete. The major construction program is estimated to
require four years nine months, with an additional onel year required to complete the
finish construction work. The first generating/pumping unit will be commissioned in
the fifth year following start of construction, with all four generating/pumping units
in operation by the end of year six.
Implementation of the environmental management and monitoring program will
commence just prior to just prior to award of the first construction contracts (i.e., for
preparatory civil works), and will initially involve pre-construction monitoring.
78



Summary EA Report - Yixing Pumped Storage Project
Regular environmental monitoring and supervision will be undertaken throughout the
construction period, until all generating/pumping units have been installed, and
contractors have demobilized from their respective work sites. Once the project sites
have been cleaned up and restored, post-construction monitoring will be carried out to
confirm the work has been satisfactorily completed. A scaled down program of
monitoring, involving only water quality monitoring, will commence once the plant is
YPSP is fully commissioned.

All of these organizations indicated that they were aware of the proposed YPSP,
having learned about the project from Television broadcasts, newspapers, and other
media. Most organizations indicated that they support the YPSP, believing that it will
contribute to development of the local economy.  Moreover, most persons
interviewed from these organizations believed that negative environmental affects can
be mitigated using appropriate construction techniques and operating regimes.
8.3.2 Survey of Resettlees and Other Local Project Affected Peoples
The World Bank policy on environmental assessment (OP 4.01) requires that persons
who may be adversely affected by a project be consulted during preparation of the
EIA, to identify issues that may be of concern to them.
In January 1999, May 2000, and February 2001, the project-affected persons (PAPs)
were surveyed.  Staff and family that will be involuntarily resettled from the
Nanyuesi Branch of the Yixing Forestry Farm, residents of Meiyan and Jiangli
villages (from Highway 104 to the lower reservoir), and some citizens of downtown
Yixing City were interviewed using a standardized questionnaire.
The survey results indicated that all those who were interviewed are familiar with the
proposed YPSP, consider it to be a project which will be benefit development of the
local economy and tourism, and consider it necessary to meet growing power
demands for the province. Most (i.e., 93.6%) of those who will be involuntarily
resettled (i.e., those residing in the staff quarters at Nanyuesi Branch of Yixing
Forestry Farm) indicated their willingness to change employment, and most (i.e.,
97.9%) are willing to relocate to a nearby location. The majority of the prospective
resettlees are of the opinion that the YPSP will not have a significant negative
influence on forestry or agriculture production, or on their lifestyle. The respondents
also expressed the opinion that any significant negative environmental impacts can be
mitigated.
8.2 Public Disclosure
Information on the YPSP has been disclosed to the public via numerous public
information events presented in Television and radio broadcasts, and newspaper
articles. In addition to being provided with information on the project, the public
82



Summary EA Report - Yixing Pumped Storage Project
has been given details on how it can provide its comments and recommendations to
the project authorities.
As a requirement of the World Bank's operational policy on environmental
assessments (OP 4.01), the Environmental Assessment report for the YPSP must be
disclosed to the public, and the public given the opportunity to provide comments.
In order to solicit opinions and comments of the public on the Environmental Impact
Assessment Report of Yixing Pumped Storage Power Project (Chinese version), an
announcement was issued on the front page of the Yixing Daily Newspaper on 06
March 2001, inviting the public to review the report at the Yixing Environmental
Protection Station offices, and provide comments and/or recommendations on the
EIA report.
Over the period 20 March 2001 to 04 April 2001, a total of fourteen members of the
public reviewed the report. The following comments were provided by these lay-
reviewers:
* The environmental assessment is based on sound data and covers the full
scope of impacts;
* Suitable environmental protection standards have been adopted for the
project;
* The environmental impacts are not so significant as to unduly threaten the
ecological and social environments, and the recommended mitigation
measures seem adequate for controlling any impacts;
* Emphasis should be placed on environmental protection during project
construction;
* The management of the local environmental protection department should be
strengthened so as to guarantee effective implementation of the EMP.

Summary and Conclusions
9.1   Introduction
This section of the report briefly summarizes the key findings of the Summary EA
Report, which is itself a consolidation of findings, conclusions and recommendations
of the Yixing Environmental Impact Assessment Report.
9.2   Project Impacts and Actions to Mitigate Them
The Yixing Pumped Storage Project (YPSP) will decrease the load difference in
Jiangsu Province Power Grid by 2000 MW, by reducing the peak load and filling the
valley load, thereby greatly alleviating the burden of thermal power plants in
regulating peak load. In addition to improving the quality and reliability of the
Jiangsu Provincial Power Grid, the project will generate sound economic returns, and
pay for itself in a relatively short period of time. The YPSP will also improve the
unstable power frequency conditions and improve the power supply quality and
reliability within the overall power grid. The YPSP will also contribute, albeit in a
minor way, to enhanced tourism opportunities within the Yixing area, by facilitating
improved access to the upper elevations of Tuangtong Mountain, an area offering
scenic vistas of the region.
A total of 757 people will be affected by the project. Of these, only 44 persons (19
families) will be involuntarily resettled. The majority (713) of the project affected
people, although they will not have to relocate will, nonetheless, be affected
economically as a result of losing a portion of their farmland or woodland enterprise
when land is taken over by the project. A Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) has been
completed, and all project affected people will be compensated in keeping with
present state and provincial policies.
The project area is predominantly commercial forestry plantation and tea plantation
and, therefore, does not provide critical natural habitat. The forest land that will be
affected by the YPSP represents only 0.78% of the Yixing Forestry Farm and,
therefore, the project will have virtually no impact on local remaining wildlife
resources. There are no rare or endangered plant or animal species that could be
affected by the YPSP. Likewise, there are no parks or nature preserves that could be
affected by the YPSP.
The key project impacts are related to the effects of construction on surface, spring
and well water, and sensitive communications structures like the Yixing TV
Transmission Station and the Yixing 173 Microwave Station, both of which are
located in the vicinity of the proposed upper reservoir. The lower reservoir will be

created by expanding the existing Huiwu Reservoir, a small artificial body of water
created to provide irrigation water to a nearby farming enterprise.
An Environmental Management Plan (EMIP) has been developed for the YPSP, and
includes measures for mitigating environmental impacts and protecting the
environment. A monitoring program will be undertaken as part of the EMP, and an
Environmental Management Office will be established for the project. Assuming that
the EMP is implemented effectively, the YPSP will not generate any significant
adverse environmental impacts. To facilitate the implementation of the EMP, a
satisfactory budget for managing the environmental aspects of the project has been
defined by the proponent, which will be included in the Government/Bank Loan
Agreement.
