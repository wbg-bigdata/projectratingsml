MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF BENIN
FOR AN EDUCATION DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.           I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on
a proposed credit to the Republic of Benin of SDR 13.2 million (US$ 18.1 million eouivalent),
to help finance an education project. The credit will be granted on standard IDA terms with 40
years maturity. The Government and beneficiary communities will contribute US$4.8 million
equivalent.
2.           Country Economic Background. Between 1975 and 1982, GDP grew at an
average rate of 5%, partly as a result of the oil and uranium booms in Nigeria and Niger. This
growth slowed between 1983 and 1987 due to the collapse in the regional transit traffic at the
end of the oil boom, and the inefficiency and poor management of the productive sectors which
the State dominates. By 1983, the Government was saddled with low-return investments, heavy
external debt service, and inadequate economic incentives. In 1989, the Government introduced
a first structural adjustment' program which represented a fundamental shift towards economic
liberalization and private sector development, and a significant reduction of the public sector's
role in the economy. Benin's successful transition to a multi-party democracy in 1991 and the
emergence of a national consensus for pursuing the adjustment program led to the adoption of
a second and more ambitious phase2 to deepen and expand fiscal, administrative, and public
enterprise reform, and trade liberalization and deregulation. This has improved growth and
revenue performance.
3.           Benin's medium- and long-term economic prospects have been improved by the
progress in the implementation of structural reforms and the recent adjustment of the CFA Franc
parity. Although GDP increased by 4.3% in 1992 and 1993, thus allowing a slight increase in
per capita incomes, the following major constraints to development remain to be addressed: (i)
a high fertility rate of 7.1; (ii) a still substantial weight of the public sector; (iii) a heavy
dependence on cotton; and (iv) an inadequate administrative and human resource capacity. Non-
public sector employment opportunities remain severely limited.
4.           Sector Background. Benin's education policy is based on the conclusions of
a national conference on education (Etats GWnEraux) held in 1990. The conference's
recommendations were translated into a strategy for education reform, adopted in 1991, together
with action plans and programs. The reform program gives priority to primary education, and
'IDA and IMF supported the adjustment through a SAL I in May 1989, and a structural adjustment facility
arrangement in June 1989.
2A SAL II (US$ 55 million equivalent) was approved by IDA in June 1991. The IMF approved a second-year
structural adjustment facility arrangement and an enlarged structural adjustment facility.



2
aims to increase the gross enrollment rate from 43% in 1990 to 59% by 1999 in public primary
schools and from 11% to 14% in public secondary schools. Supported by USAID, a program
is being implemented to improve budget allocations between primary and the other levels of
education, and between salary and non-salary expenditures. While this program and other
adjustment measures have already succeeded in increasing the gross primary enrollment rate to
51 % in 1993, in spite of an annual population growth of 3.1 % in 1990, this rate remains well
below the Sub-Saharan Africa average of 70%. Moreover, during the last three years, the gross
enrollment rate has declined at the secondary level from 17% to 11 %. Although the proportion
of girls has increased from 33% to 36% at primary, 21 % to 30% at lower-secondary and 11 %
to 21 % at higher secondary levels, disparities are still wide; girls' participation varies from 26%
to 40% among regions and gross enrollment rates at the primary level can range fron- 20% in
some rural areas to 85% in some urban areas. The development of the whole education system
is constrained by the inefficient management of resources. The quality and internal efficiency
of the system are poor at all levels, demonstrated by high repetition and drop-out rates and very
poor examination results, well below the norms for Sub-Saharan Africa. Benin's adult " =eracy
rate stands at only 23%.
5.           The critical issues that affect all levels of education are: (a) poor access and
equity (affecting in particular girls and children in rural areas); (b) poor efficiency; and (c)
financial constraints, high costs and weak sector planning and management. Overall, the quality
of education is very poor. Between 1970 and 1986, average repetition rates increased from 19%
to 27% in primary schools, and from 12% to 32 % in secondary general schools. Repetition
rates are highest at the university where they have risen to above 40% in the general programs,
and 24% in the professional schools. Two-thirds of an entering cohort drop out of primary
school after an average of 4.7 years. This poor performance can be attributed in part to: (i) a
shortage of teaching materials; (ii) a lack of attention to student learning outcomes; (iii)
inadequate school facilities; (iv) systemic weaknesses in financial management, personnel
administration and pedagogic planning; and (v) a highly centralized decision-making process.
6.           To address these issues, IDA has helped the Govermnent to develop a reform
program of the education sector through the second Structural Adjustment Credit. Over the past
few years, education has received an average of 35% of the Government's recurrent budget and
about 8% of the national investment budget, which is relatively high by the standards of Sub-
Saharan Africa. In 1993, the budget allocations between primary, secondary and higher
education have improved, wiyh allocations of 66%, 16% and 18% respectively. Government's
budget projections for 1994-1999 have reduced the share of the university budget to 13% of the
education sector budget. During the period 1990-1993, the Government has increased the
teacher:student ratios from 1:31 to 1:41 at the primary level, and 1:18 to 1:33 at the general
secondary level. The Government plans to increase the teacher:student ratio to a maximum of
1:50 by 1999. While redeployment of teachers from administrative positions to active teaching
in classrooms is currently being implemented, the Government plans to implement other cost-
saving measures by 1997: (a) multigrade teaching where applicable in rural areas; and (b) a
double-shift system in urban areas. These measures will allow the Government to attain its
enrollment targets by 1999 and contain total requirement for teachers to 2,100 (about 1,630 at



3
the primary level and 470 at the secondary level) and the requirement for additional classrooms
to 1,630 for primary schools.  The final shortfall of teachers will be met through the
implementation of a new hiring system for contractual teachers to be developed by the project
and adopted by March 31, 1997.
7.           Project Objectives. The central objectives of the project are to: (a) increase
the access to primary schools, with a specific emphasis on girls' participation both at the primary
and secondary levels; (b) improve the quality and internal efficiency of primary and secondary
education; and (c) improve the institutional capacity for planning and managing the human and
financial resources of the sector.
8.           Project Description and Financing. To achieve these objectives, the project
will support Government's efforts to: (a) increase non-wage expenditures for primary and
secondary schools, provide basic school supplies and continuous in-service training to teachers,
strengthen school and teacher supervision; (b) establish a sustainable system for textbook
provision; and (c) contain recurrent costs by reducing redundant administrative staff, redeploying
teachers currently in administration to the classrooms, developing multigrade teaching and a
double-shift system where applicable, and increasing teacher:student ratios. The Govermment
will respect budget allocation criteria based on an indicative spending plan for 1994-1999 agreed
with IDA.
9.           The project will finance investments designed to: (a) increase access to primary
education, with a particular focus on girls' participation (US$6.2 million) through (i) primary
school rehabilitation and reconstruction with the participation of beneficiary communities and
(ii) the implementation of a program to encourage girls' schooling at the primary and secondary
levels; (b) improve the quality and efficiency of primary and secondary education (US$11.0
million) through (i) in-service training for teaching staff, and management training for secondary
schools heads, and (ii) textbooks provision; and (c) improve sector planning and management
capacity of the Ministry of National Education (Ministere de l'&ducation nationale, MEN) at
central and regional levels, and rehabilitate the offices of the MEN (US$5.3 million).
10.           Total project costs, including duties and taxes, are estimated at US$22.9
million, with a base cost of US$19.3 million and a foreign exchange component of US$17.5
million. Price contingencies, estimated at US$1.8 million assume a foreign inflation rate of
2.5%; and annual domestic inflation rates of 10.9% (FY1995-1996); 6.4% (FY1996-1997); and
3% from FY 1997-1998 onwards. Physical contingencies, estimated at US$1.8 million, provide
for 10% of base costs for works and goods. IDA will fnance 79% of total project costs
(US$18.1 million). The Government will fmance 11.0% of total project costs, including 100%
of all taxes and duties (US$2.5 million). The communities will contribute US$2.3 million or
10% of total project costs.
11.          Project Ihnlementation. The MEN will implement and coordinate the project
as part of its overall reform program. Technical assistance and training will be provided in
support of planning, management, project accounting and contract management. MEN's



4
Department of Analysis, Forecasting and Synthesis (Direction de I'analyse, la prevision et la
synth?se) will be responsible for the overall coordination and evaluation of project activities.
The Department of Financial Affairs (Direction des Affaires financiWres, DAF) will be
responsible for all financial matters related to the project implementation. Each project
component will be executed by existing units in the MEN. The management of the rehabilitation
of primary schools and of the construction of boarding facilities for secondary female students
will be contracted to non-governnental agencies. Procurement and distribution of an initial
stock of textbooks, and the rehabilitation of the MEN offices, will be carried out by the private
sector.
12.          Project Sustainability. Recurrent costs generated by project activities (mainly
teachers' salaries) will be limited through efiiciency measures and will be financed within the
budget during the project period. Measures to contain these increases include: (a) at the primary
school level, increasing progressively the current teaher:student ratio, and developing where
applicable multigrade teaching in rural areas and a double-shift system in urban areas by March
31, 1997, after a study on these reforms financed by the project has been completed; (b) at the
secondary level, redeployment of teachers from current administrative positions to active
teaching in classrooms; and (c) at the level of the MEN, further reduction of administrative staff.
The total estimated savings of CFAF 7.6 billion (US$ 12.8 million equivalent) assume a strict
enforcement of these measures, thus reducing the additional cost to the Government to CFAF
1.7 billion (US$ 2.9 million equivalent) per year. Furthermore, the decentralization and
rationalization of communities' participation, estimated at US$2.3 million, for primary school
building maintenance and textbook replenishment at the lower-secondary level wvill promote
operational efficiency and long-term sectoral development.
13.          Lessons learned. The Bank Group has been involved in Benir.'s education
sector since 1975. IDA financed two Education projects (Cr. 583-DA, 1976-1983; Cr. 1246-
BEN, 1982-1989), all completed, to support efforts at improving the relevance and quality of
education. The construction of three regional teacher institutes and textbook production and
distribution were the main elements of the Second Education Project. Since 1989, IDA, under
the Social and Emergency Funds of the Health Services Development Project (Cr. 2031-BEN)
and SAL II (Cr. 2283-BEN) has financed textbook provision, rehdbilitation of primary and
secondary schools, and the development of the university library. The completion reports for
the first two projects and the supervision of ongoing interventions indicate delays in contract
awards, inadequate project monitoring and coordination and institutional incapacity to meet
textbooks production targets. The implementation of ongoing interventions has been constrained
by: (a) the absence of a decision-maldng framework to guide the selection of schools to be
rehabilitated as well and the procurement of textbooks; and (b) the weak institutional capacity
within the MEN to implement a modest program of school rehabilitation. The proposed project
will address these problems by: (i) procuring textbooks through ICB and building capacity for
textbooks evaluation within the three units of the MEN in charge of pedagogy; (ii) finalizing the
draft implementation manual, submitted during negotiations, by credit effectiveness; (iii)
strengthening the newly created Department within the MEN (DAF) that assumes the key
responsibilities for budget monitoring, accounting and the overall fnancial management of the



5
sector; and (iv) conducting joint annual reviews to evaluate the execution of budget allocations
agreed upon and the progress achieved in carrying out planned activities. The standard bidding
documents for ICB procurement of goods have already been prepared, and the Government has
confirmed that it will contract the management of the primary schools rehabilitation and of the
boarding facilities construction to non-governmental agencies.
14.          Rationale for lIDA Involvement. IDA activities in the sector have, over the
past two years, focused on assisting the development of the policy framework for the adjustment
and development of the sector and for the re-organization of the structtres, functions and staffing
of the MEN. Having assisted the Government under the SAL II to establish the policy and
institutional framework for the development of the sector, IDA is now responding to the
Government's request for substantial assistance in implementing these revised policies and plans,
in order to strengthen the human resource basis of Benin. IDA's financing will complement the
budgetary support and technical assistance for primary school development provided by USAID
and will also focus on secondary school development. This operation is consistent with the
Country Assistance Strategy discussed by the Board in February 1992 through: (i) addressing
institutional development and human resources constraints notably by improving the management
capacity for budget and personnel within the MEN; and (ii) improving basic social services by
better allocations of resources between primary and higher education. It is in line with the
poverty reduction strategy of the Government. A Country Assistance note is currently under
preparation; it will be presented to the Executive Directors in June in the context of a proposed
Economic Rehabilitation Credit. The project is also closely linked to objectives sought under
the Food Security project and the Rural Water Supply and Sanitation project which are scheduled
to be presented to the Executive Directors during this fiscal year.
15.          Aged Actions. As conditions of credit effectiveness, the Government will
have: (a) submitted bidding documents acceptable to IDA for all major packages to be procured
through International Competitive Bidding during the firt year of the project; (b) prepared
contracts for the consultant's services required under the project for the first year of the project;
(c) appointed an independent auditor under a multi-year contract acceptable to IDA; (d) adopted
an implementation manual detailing project procedures; (e) developed draft operational guidelines
for textbook replenishment; and (t) within the MEN, developed a more efficient budgetary
process, a project accounting and procurement capacity, and have trained the appropriate staff.
As conditions of disbursements for civil works, the Government will have: (a) signed a contract
with a non-profit organization and developed operational guidelines for the management of the
boarding facilities for girls; and (b) signed contracts with non-governmental agencies for the
management and supervision of the civil works related to the boarding facilities and classroom
rehabilitation and reconstruction programs. As a condition of disbursement for textbooks, the
Government will have adopted operational guidelines for textbook replenishment.
16.          Environmental Asnects. This is a Category C project, without any direct
impact on the environment.



6
17.          Program Objective Categories. This project responds to the human resources
development and anti-poverty objectives of the Government by improving access to primary
education in general and for girls in particular, improving the quality of education, and
strengthening the participation of beneficiary communities in the education sector. Since the
proportion of the poor among the project beneficiaries will be significantly larger than their
proportion to the overall population of Benin, this project is part of the Program of Targeted
Interventions. It also responds to the African Capacity Building Initiative objectives through the
strengthening of the management and planning capacity within the MEN.
18.          ProJect iBn t. There are two main benefits. The first benefit will be
provision of more and better education, which in the long term will contribute to poverty
reduction. Access to school will increase, and the primary school gross enrollment rate will
raise from 51% to 59% during the project period. Girls' enrollment will increase from 36% to
42% at the primaiy level as a result of targeted activities and the increased number of places in
schools, and from 30% to 40% at the lower-secondary level as a result of the creation of
boarding facilities. The improvement of female education will in the long run translate into: (i)
better infant and maternal health; (ii) increased women's labor productivity; (iii) improved
women's employment opportunities; and (iv) a better predisposition to adopt measures for family
planning among educated girls and women. The quality of education will be improved through
the rationalization of school building and maintenance and the provision of an initial stock of
textbooks at the primary and lower-secondary levels. Improved training and supervision of
teachers by school officers and school heads, pedagogical material availability and better student
examination will increase internal efficiency and improve student learning outcomes. The
second benefit will be the development of capacity witiin the MEN to plan and manage the
sector more effectively. The development of competent technical and administrative staff in the
newly established structures, better functions and staffing pattern of the MEN, and increased
decentralization of responsibilities for educational planning, management and administration to
the regional education offices will improve systems operations and responsiveness to local needs.
The new primary school building procedures and textbook replenishment at the lower secondary-
level will rationalize the participation of communities and strengthen their role in the education
system.
19.          Risks. There are two main risks. The first risk is failure to attain project goals
if the budget allocations for the sector, agreed with the Government and analyzed thoroughly to
ensure their coherence with implications of project components, are not executed. This risk has
been addressed by agreements reached with IDA regarding budget allocation; budget execution
will be monitored and reviewed annually. Moreover, the release of funds for the ongoing
USAID program of budgetary support and technical assistance for primary education is
conditioned upon agreements for budget allocation and execution that are identical to those
agreed upon with IDA. Project activities directed towards establishing a better framework for
teacher employment, including the recruitment of contractual (non-civil servant) teachers for
primary schools will be equally significant in this respect. A second risk is delayed project
implementation due to the fact that project implementation goes in parallel with the development
of staff competence and changes in management behaviors. This risk is addressed by ongoing



7
efforts to match defined posts with staff profiles, the provision of technical expertise to the
sector, the use of technical assistance to transfer skills to staff, and the continuous monitoring
and evaluation to remove bottlenecks to implementation. Equally significant in this regard is
the dclegation of responsibility for managing classroom rehabilitation and reconstruction to non-
governmental agencies.
20.          Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors
approve it.

DISBURSEMENTS
The bulk of the portfolio has been put in place since Benin's move to a
democratic government and a market-oriented economy in 1991. Credit effectiveness and, for
that matter, project implementation of some operations have been delayed because of the
insistence of the newly elected Parliament, in which the Government only holds a small majority,
to review in detail the related legal documents. Moreover, project implementation issues, such
as poor administration of special accounts and non-compliance with the Bank's procurement
procedures have slowed down disbursements. A country implementation review in June 1992
addressed these and other issues and agreed upon specific corrective actions, such as carrying out
an audit of the government debt (CAA) management agency, restructuring of some projects and
organization of a disbursement seminar for project coordinators which took place in February
1993. The reorganization of the CAA is expected to be completed shortly. Moreover, in
September 1993, the Government agreed to improve management of special accounts, formerly
administered by the CAA. Special accounts are now opened and maintained in a commercial
bank, in line with the Bank's Disbursement Departnent's recommendations.
