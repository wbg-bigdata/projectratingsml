MALAYSIA: APPRAISAL REPORT OF A POPULATION PROJECT
SUMTMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
I.        This report appraises a population project in West Malaysia for
which a Bank loan of US$5.0 million is proposed. The project consists of
items to be financed by the Bank, the United Nations Fund for Population
Activities (UNFPA) and the Government of Malaysia, (GOM). The UNFPA and the
Bank would finance separate identifiable project components.
ii.       Although well-endowed with natural resources and currently in a
favorable financial position, Malaysia is facing economic and social pres-
sure resulting from a high rate of population growth. On the one hand, the
high rate of population growth has been rapidly adding to the labor force
and, on the other hand, it has made fewer of the country's resources avail-
able to raise living standards%and to create employment.  Consequently, the
country suffers from large unemployment and underemployment. Furthermore,
the relatively high fertility of the poorer sections of the society has made
the equalization of economic opportunities more difficult.
iii.      The national program that helped to reduce the birth rate from 46
in 1957 to 33 in 1969 is facing difficulties in further reducing the birth
rate. The number of new acceptors has been continuously declining since
1969. One of the main constraints in reducing the general fertility rate
is the inadequacy of resources to reach 70% of the population living in
rural areas. Without a sharp decline in fertility the birth rate 1/ is ex-
pected to increase because of a larger number of persons entering the re-
productive ages as a consequence of the post-World War II baby boom.
iv.       The proposed project is designed to strengthen the national family
planning program. In functional terms the project will help to: (a) im-
prove administration and management of the family planning program, (b)
extend family planning services to rural areas, (c) expedite training of
paramedical personnel in family planning, (d) introduce population education
in schools, (e) improve family planning, nutrition and health education pro-
grams particularly for the rural population, (f) establish population re-
search units, and (g) demonstrate the effect of various intensive inputs in
an area as a basis for developing long-term policies.
1/   The birth rate is births per 1,000 total population; the general fertility
rate is births per women aged 15-44. Birth rates can change with changes
in the age-distribution which is often variable, but which does not re-
flect a change in reproductive behavior. Thus, birth rates are usually
easier to calculate than fertility rates, but are less significant as
an indicator of changing reproductive behavior.



- ii -
v.        The project would consist of:
(a)  construction, equipment and furniture for maternal and child
health and family planning (MCH/FP) administrative centers in
each state, MCH/FP clinics in rural health centers, family
planning clinics in Government hospitals, a new rural health
training center (RHTC) and additions to an existing RHTC and
to existing midwifery clinic-cum-quarters;
(b) equipment for evaluation and research, sterilization opera-
tions, IUD insertions, pap smear tests, nutrition education,
and for production of educational and training materials
and audiovisual support for group talks;
(c) vehicles for mobile health teams, mobile information units,
field training, and supervision;
(d)  advisory services for MCH/FP administration and management,
for introduction of population education, population and
communications research, production of educational material
and training in health education;
(e) funds for training teachers in population education and
training of paramedical staff and traditional midwives in
family planning;
(f) preparation and printing of material for population educa-
tion and for information, education and communications
program;
(g)  supplies of contraceptives, books and films; and
(h) establishment of a Project Construction Unit and an extern-
al review of the program mid-way through the project.
vi.       Total project cost is estimated at US$14.5 million.  It will be
financed by a UNFPA grant of US$4.3 million, a Bank loan of US$5.0 million,
and a GOM contribution of US$5.2 million. The Bank loan finances the total
foreign exchange cost estimated at 49% of the Bank-assisted component of the
project, including interest and other charges.
vii.      Items to be financed by the UNFPA consist primarily of contracep-
tive supplies, vehicles, training stipends, medical instruments and various
advisory services. The Bank loan will finance construction, certain vehicles,
computing and audiovisual equipment, research advisers and a management study.
viii.     For the implementation of the project, the GOM would form a Project
Implementation Committee that would be chaired by the representative of the
Economic Planning Unit and would consist of representatives of all agencies
responsible for the project. The proposed Deputy Director of the NFPB would



- iii -
act as Project Administrator and be responsible for the whole project. A
Project Construction Unit would be established in the Ministry of Health to
implement the construction component of the project.
ix.       Contracts for equipment, furniture and vehicles would be awarded
on the basis of international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank
guidelines. The contracts for civil works would be subject to Malaysia's
procurement procedures.
x.        The project is intended to help the national family planning pro-
gram achieve faster fertility decline than possible otherwise. It is ex-
pected that by 1985 the project should help to reduce the birth rate to 21
as compared to 26 evisaged without it. Consequently, in 1985, the natural
rate of population growth will be reduced to 1.5% instead of about 2.0%.
As a result of lower population growth, it is estimated that by 1985 the per
capita income with the project would be higher by about 5%. In addition,
with a sharper reduction in fertility, the labor force should be smaller by
about 237,000 by the end of the century; in 1970 the labor force was 2.9
million, of which 250,000 were unemployed.






APPRAISAL REPORT OF A POPULATION PROJECT
MALAYSIA
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      Following a reconnaissance mission to Malaysia from June 27 -
July 1, 1971 a preappraisal mission visited Malaysia from November 1 -26,
1971 at the request of the Government of Malaysia (GON). The main findings
of the mission and a proposed project were transmitted to the GOM in
December, 1971. As a result of the GOM's positive reaction, an appraisal
mission visited Malaysia from February 21 to March 21, 1972.
1.02      At the same time as a project suitable for Bank financing was
being developed, the GOM was preparing several requests for UNFPA financing
for some components of the national family planning program. Consequently,
the UNFPA and the Bank agreed to coordinate their efforts on a comprehensive
project to be financed on a parallel basis. A UNFPA mission, which visited
Malaysia in June 1972 to discuss the requests with the GOM was joined by a
Bank staff member. As a result of this visit and subsequent meetings at
Bank headquarters between the Bank and the UNFPA and between the GOM and the
Bank, a project suitable for parallel financing by the UNFPA and the Bank
was finalized. During negotiations of the Bank-financed components in
Washington, a representative of the UNFPA was present; and the Bank sent a
representative to attend negotiations of the UNFPA agreement in New York.
II. POPULATION PROBLEN5
2.01      Malaysia today is a country of about 11 million people.  It is
relatively well-endowed with natural resources and the per capita income is
fairly high. The demographic fact that gives importance to the national
policy of slowing population growth is the average annual rate of natural
increase of about 3% for the sixties, which has been one of the highest in
Asia (Annex 1). As a result, the country has serious unemployment and un-
deremployment problems. The high rate of population growth has not only
rapidly added to the labor force but also reduced the ability to create a
sufficiently large number of jobs.  Further, the high fertility of low in-
come groups has made the task of equalizing economic opportunities more
difficult. While it is well-recognized that the task of improving living
standards is a complex one, lower fertility is one significant means of
equalizing economic opportunities, raising per capita income, and, particu-
larly in the long run, of reducing unemployment.
2.02      During the First Malaysian Plan period (1966-70), the pace of new
job creation could not keep up with the large increase in the labor supply.
As a result, unemployment increased from about 180,000 or 6.5% of the labor
force in 1965, to 250,000 or about 8% in 1970. Unemployment in West Malaysia



- 2 -
is largely a youth problem partly because of the post-war baby boom; in 1969,
about 75% of the total unemployed were in the 15-25 age group. Serious un-
employment occurs in urban areas where the rate is around 10%. The Second
Malaysia Plan (1971-75) stresses the importance of job creation to reduce
unemployment. The labor force is expected to grow at 3.2% per annum during
this period. Therefore, despite the creation of 596,000 jobs over the Plan
period, the rate of unemployment is expected to remain constant at 8% in
1975. In addition to open unemployment, a large number of workers are in low
productivity jobs or they are underemployed, particularly in rural areas
(Annex 2).
2.03      In Malaysia, the per capita gross national product at market prices
(US$380) is much higher than that of many other developing countries. But
its rate of growth has been slow in recent years because of deteriorating
terms of trade in its major export crops on the one hand and a high rate of
population growth on the other hand. For example, the increase in gross
national income which averaged more than 7% per annum in 1961-65, declined
to 4.8% in 1965-70 and to 3.0% in 1970-71. These increases w~'ere largely
offset by the high rate of population growth. Consequent' , the growth in
per capita income declined from 4% per annum in 1961-65 to 1.4% in 1965-70
and 0.3% in 1970-71.
2.04      Reliable data on income distribution are not available.  Yet, on
the basis of available information and observation, income disparities among
various ethnic groups and regions appear to be large. These disparities are
reinforced by relatively larger sized families among the disadvantaged groups
and thereby limited opportunities for better education, nutrition and health
among the most needy section of the population.
2.05      The first census in 1911 reported the population of West Malaysia
at 2.3 million and according to the 1957 census the population had reached
6.3 million. Although the results of the 1970 census are not yet final, the
population is estimated at 9.3 million. Between 1957 and 1964, the natural
rate of population growth averaged more than 3%, and declined to 2.5% by
1970. This decline resulted from a decrease in the birth rate from more than
46 in 1957 to 32 in 1970, and despite a simultaneous decrease in the death
rate from 12.4 per thousand to 7.2. This decline in crude birth rate repre-
sents a genuine decline in fertility and not simply a change in the age
structure of population as the general fertility rate also declined from 229
in 1957 to 157 in 1970.
2.06      Recently, the country has been facing considerable difficulty in
reducing the general fertility rate because of inadequate facilities for ex-
tending the program to rural areas. Between 1969 and 1970, the general
fertility rate declined only from 163 to 157 and the birth rate from 33 to 32.
The task of reducing the birth rate is likely to become all the more difficult
for the next several years because of the entry of an even larger number of
persons in the reproductive ages resulting from the postwar baby boom. Thus,
the birth rate is estimated to have increased to 30.4 in 1971



- 3 -
and may go as high as 35.3 in 1975 and to 37.6 in 1980, if current fertility
rates remain unchanged and consequently, the rate of population growth may
increase to about 2.8% in 1975 and to more than 3% in 1980. Even largely
increased GOM efforts in family planning can, therefore, only reduce the
birth rate moderately, due to those transitory, but unfavorable, effect of
the age distribution. If fertility remains constant, however, it is esti-
mated that the population may reach 23 million by the end of the century.
III. FAMILY PLANNING PROGRAM
A. Organization
3.01      Recognizing the problems posed by rapid pcpulation growth, the
Family Planning Association, a voluntary organization, first began family
planning activities in Selangor State in July 1953. By July 1962, Family
Planning Associations had been established in all eleven states of West
Malaysia. At present they are responsible for implementation of the family
planning program at state level, while a council incorporating the eleven
FPA representatives called the Federation of Family Planning Association
(FFPA) is responsible for overall planning and policy.
3.02      The Government adopted family planning as a national policy in
1964. To implement the program, the National Family Planning Board (NFPB)
was established in 1966 as an interministerial organization under the Prime
Minister's Department; it was given statutory powers and a certain degree of
autonomy under the Family Planning Act. The Board is comprised of a Chair-
man, at present the Minister of Commerce and Industry, a Director and twenty
members--ten representing different ministries and ten representing various
public groups. At present, the NFPB is comprised of six technical divisions
with acting heads and other full-time staff which numbered 456 in 1971. The
head of the Administrative, Finance and Supply Division is the Secretary of
the Board. (Chart 6482) At the state level, the NFPB has medical officers
and information officers, as well as other staff to implement its activities.
The official family planning program is so far confined to West Malaysia
where 85% of the country's population resides and where the population
density is 183 per square mile. In East Malaysia, which has a density of
22 miles2 and is comprised of the two states of Sabah and Sarawak, voluntary
organizations have initiated the program.
3.03      Recently the NFPB decided to extend family planning services to
rural areas by integrating family planning with the maternal and child health
(MCH) services of the Ministry of Health (MOH). Integration, in this case,
means extension of services to rural areas by utilizing the health personnel
and facilities under the responsibility of the MOH. (Chart 6507) The Director
of the NFPB, however, is still responsible for planning, directing, and co-
ordinating family planning services in the country and exercises the same
power in the integrated areas as in the others. Coordination Committees,



- 4 -
comprised of representatives of the NFPB and the MOH, have been formed at
central and state levels for coordination of activities. The State Medical
and ilealth Officer (SMHO), the highest officer of the 4I0H at the state level,
is the Chairman of the State Coordinating Committee and is responsible for
executing and supervising the integrated program.
B. Existing Facilities
Family Planning Clinics
3.04      The NFPB delivers family planning services largely in urban areas
through 77 clinics providing daily services and through 413 mobile teams pro-
viding periodic services. Most of the clinics are located either in Govern-
ment hospitals or maternal and child health clinics. While the NFPB was
quite successful in establishing its clinics in urban areas it failed to
meet the schedule in the rural areas mainly due to a shortage of health
personnel. Having recognized this difficulty, the NFPB agrred that family
planning services should be functionally integrated with the rural health
services of the MOTI. By 1971, the MOH integration program had covered a
population of a little less than 1 million in 8 health districts in 7 states
out of 47 health districts in 11 states. (Map 3731) Therefore, out of 44
main health centers (MHCs) and 180 subhealth centers (SHCs) in West Malaysia,
family planning services are only available in 11 MHCs and 42 SHCs. (Map
3999) The MOH is planning to extend integration to six more districts by
1973 and to the remaining districts in phases during 1974-76 depending on
the completion of staff training in these states. In addition to the NFPB
and the MOH clinics, the FFPA delivered services through 164 clinics in 1970.
Since the NFPB is gradually taking over the m A clinics, the FFPA recognizes
that, as a voluntary organization, it can play a more important role in future
information and education efforts.
Training
3.05      Most of the staff employed by the NFPB for the delivery of services
is medical or paramedical. The doctors are trained at the Faculty of Medicine,
University of Malaya which has an annual intake of 100-120 students. The para-
medical staff consists of nurses, trained assistant nurses (TANs), and mid-
wives. The basic training of nurses takes place in three schools of nursing,
assistant nurses are trained in 17 schools at Government hospitals and mid-
wives are trained in thirteen of these hospitals. The annual student intake
is: 450 for nurses, 280 for assistant nurses, and 150 for midwives. Although
family planning is not included in the basic student curricula for any of
these staff categories, in-service training in public health (including family
planning) is provided at the Public Health Institute (PHI) to doctors and
staff nurses and, at its subsidiaries, the two rural health training centers
(RHTCs), to other paramedical staff. The annual intake for the PHI is about
500 and for the RHTCs about 144. Family planning courses are included in
in-service training at the PHI and the RHTCs. The short-term in-service



training in family planning of medical and paramedical staff in integration
areas is the responsibility of the NFPB and the MOH. The NFPB is responsible
for training of doctors and staff nurses and the MGH for assistant nurses
and midwives at state level. The training program proceeds gradually state
by state.
Information, Education, and Communications
3.06      The Information Division of the NFPB with its ten regional offices
is responsible for information, education, and communication aspects of the
family planning program. Each regional office has an information officer
and a field assistant. All regional offices have radios, tape recorders and
slide projectors to reinforce information talks. These regional information
offices carry out group education in collaboration with other ministries
wherever possible. The headquarters unit supervises and coordinates the
work of the regional units and develops and produces material for group
sessions. The MOH is planning to include family planning in its health
education programs to emphasize the health aspects of the program.
Evaluation and Research
3.07      The evaluation of the program is undertaken exclusively by the
Evaluation Division of the NFPB with technical support by the Government
Department of Statistics. The Division is comprised of the head of the
unit, a research assistant, coders and punchers, and has access to computer
facilities at the Department of Statistics whenever computer time is avail-
able. Research capabilities of the Division are limited and so far most of
the research on population has been undertaken by the University of Michigan.
Family Planning Budget
3.08      The GOM is the main source of funds for institutions providing
family planning services and is complemented by foreign assistance. In 1971,
while the NFPB estimated the expenditures at M$2,313,000 (US$820,000), only
M$2,000,000 (US$709,000) was available due to the budget cut. However, the
provision of an additional grant was being considered by the COM. In 1972,
for the first time, the MOH had a budgetary provision of M$70,415 (US$24,974)
for family planning.
Foreign Assistance
3.09      In addition to the GOM grant of US$709,000, the NFPB received
US$275,000 in 1971 from the Swedish International Development Authority
(SIDA) in the form of contraceptive pills and equipment and about US$82,000
from UNICEF for the training of midwives. In 1966, the Ford Foundation ap-
proved an initial grant of US$189,000 for the University of Michigan to
provide advisory assistance and material to the Government of Malaysia.
An additional grant of US$124,000 was approved to cover assistance until
1970.

C. Program Achievements
Acceptors
3.10      The targets of new acceptors for 1967-70 were based on the somewhat
arbitrary goal of reaching one quarter of the married women; these targets
were not related to a desired reduction in the birth rate and were not too
ambitious compared to the targets in other countries such as Korea. However,
the national program during this period recruited about 21% of the married
women as new acceptors against the target of 26%. The largest number of new
acceptors was reached in 1968 at 75,000; since then the number has declined
to less than 56,000 in 1970 and 55,000 in 1971. The trend for this year is
also not very encouraging as only about 19,000 new acceptors were reported
by April 1972. By the end of the year, the performance may not be better
than in 1971. While the achievement exceeded the target in 1968 and 1969,
it was only 48% of the target in 1970 and less than 46% in 1971. Between
1967-72, the NFPB recruited 63% of the acceptors; the FFPA, 28%, and the
MOH 1.5%; the rest were recruited by other organizations, s nch as rubber
estates, Federal Land Development Authority, etc. Accordaipg to the NFPB
annual report, the program so far seems to have concentrated on the less-
educated and on high fertility groups. About three-fourths of the acceptors
were reported to have had no schooling or only a primary school education,
and more than half of them were less than 30 years of age.
Methods and Continuation Rates
3.11      The pill constitutes the basic method of contraception; 87% of the
new acceptors used this method in 1971. However, sterilization is gaining
in popularity. In 1971, sterilization (mainly female) accounted for 7.2%
of all methods used as compared to 3.8% in 1969. According to the acceptor
follow-up survey of 1969, 54% of the acceptors continued to use contraception
after one year of acceptance and about 42% after 18 months, representing rela-
tively high continuation rates.
Knowledge, Attitude, and Practice
3.12      Results of knowledge, attitude, and practice surveys of family
planning for 1966-67 (before the program started) and for 1970, are avail-
able. During this period, eligible respondents with knowledge of family
planning increased from 44% to 84%; those disapproving of family planning
declined from 21% to 13%, those who ever used a method increased from 14%
to 27% and current users increased from 9% to 18% in the country as a whole.
These results suggest an increasing awareness and hopefully an increasing
demand for family planning services.

D.  Future Targets and Program Constraints
Targets
3.13      The existilig program aims at a reduction in birth rate to 32 in
1975 and to 26 in 1985. Accordingly, the target is to recruit 600,000 new
acceptors in 1971-75. From this total, 420,000 are estimated to be recruited
from rural areas and 180,000 from urban areas. With existing facilities, the
MOH estimates that it could reach only about 217,000 of the rural acceptors,
while the NFPB estimates that it could recruit about 150,000 urban acceptors,
or nearly 40% of the targets. Although a small proportion of these targets
may be reached by the FPAs and other agencies, there would still be a con-
siderable short£fall in achievements as compared to the targets of acceptors.
This would imply a rate of population growth possibly exceeding 2.5% in 1975.
Even in 1985, with the existing aim of decline in birth rate to 26, the growth
rate of population would still be around 2%. The program, therefore, needs
improvement not only to achieve the existing targets but to set more reason-
able goals to reduce the birth rate to at least 21 and thereby, the rate of
population growth to 1.5% by 1985.
Program Constraints
3. 14     Inadequate Political Commitment: Although the program was quite
successful in the initial years, increasingly it is experiencing difficul-
ties partly as a result of the political situation. The subject of family
planning is politically sensitive in Malaysia today, a situation which pre-
vents the Government from addressing itself to demographic problems as openly
and directly as some proponents of fertility control would like.
3.15      Insufficient Administrative Personnel:  There is no Deputy Director
of the NFPB to fill the gap in the administrative hierarchy between the Di-
rector and the Division Heads. In the absence of the Director, the program
is handled by the heads of various divisions but they lack authority to make
major decisions. At the MOH as well, despite the fact that three-fourths of
the staff at the rural health centers are employed to assist in the provision
of MCH services, no one officer at the state level is fully responsible for
such services.
3.16      Inadequate Interagency Coordination:  Although the MOM is expected
to play an important role in the national program, its activities are not
fully coordinated with the NFPB. The Coordinating Committees formed by the
NFPB and the MOH are not effective as they lack proper recognition and power.
Consequently, in the integrated areas at state level, there is very little
cooperation between the NFPB and the MOH staff, a situation which adversely
affects the implementation of the program. Also, the program has a heavy
medical orientation and until now there has not been much involvement of
the Ministries of Education, National and Rural Development, and Information,
etc. These Ministries have important extension education programs in rural
areas which can be fruitfully utilized for family planning education in co-
operation with the NFPB.



- 8 -
3.17      Delay in Extension of Family Planning Services.  The pace of ex-
tending family planning services to the rural population has been too slow.
Even the present plan to complete the coverage of rural areas by 1976 is in-
adequate for achieving the targets.  The main bottleneck in the extension of
the family planning services to rural areas is stated to be an insufficient
number of paramedical personnel trained in family planning. The RHTCs re-
sponsible for in-service training in family planning do not have sufficient
space and facilities to accommodate the existing backlog. The short-term
in-service training program of the NFPB and the MCH is inadequate largely
because of a shortage of funds and the lack of initiative by state-level
MH officers to make the necessary arrangements.
3.18      Heavy Reliance on Pills:  Until the present time, the family plan-
ning program has relied heavily on oral contraceptives. However, since about
half of the acceptors reportedly are under 30 years of age, remaining on pills
for 10-15 years would not ensure high continuation ratps in the long run. The
MOH has not as yet decided to provide sterilization services, although it in-
tends to provide IUD services.  The NFPB does perform sterilizations, but only
in its urban clinics.
3.19      Restriction on InforNtion, Education and Communications Program:
At present, information efforts are confined to infrequent talks within a
region by the NFPB. The face-to-face motivation program is also inadequate
since the hospital postpartum program is not well-developed and a NFPB policy
for home visiting has not been established. In addition, political problems
have caused restriction of mass media usage as well as the organization of
NFPB group talks in some regions.
3.20      Limited Program Evaluati_o  and Research.  The Evaluation Division
of the NFPB is largely engaged in the computation of service statistics. No
detailed evaluation is made of program inputs to analyze their impact. So
far, no institute in Malaysia is involved in studies and research on popu-
lation problems. Until now all research on population has been conducted
by outside investigators with token collaboration by local researchers,
resulting in the development of limited capability within the country.
3.21      Indefinite Plan of Action:  Although the NFPB determines the tar-
gets for the country's five-year plan, so far no comprehensive family plan-
ning plan relating program activities to target has been approved by the
Board and adopted by the Government.
IV. THE PROJECT
4.01      The project has been developed in the light of foregoing constraints
and other program requirements. It covers only West Malaysia where the Gov-
ernments efforts have been so far confined. The project aims at the extension
of services to the rural population and intensification of such efforts in
urban areas. Since the success of the program depends on the demand for



- 9 -
these services, the project incorporates facilities to effectively approach
the couples in the reproductive ages and to introduce population education
in the school system for the younger generation. The long-term development
of the program under the project would be based on the results of a management
study, the experience gained by evaluating the effectiveness of intensive
inputs in the demonstration areas, and operational research to be undertaken
by the NFPB. Locations for the physical project facilities are indicated on
Map 3760 and a summary description of the project by functional categories
follows:
i.   Administration:  (a) construction, equipment and furnishing of
MCH/FP administrative centers in all eleven states, (b) a

training, (e) six buses for RHTCs and four for regional auxiliary
staff training centers and for FFPA trainees, and (f) training
of auxiliary staff and traditional midwives in family planning
services and seminars on various aspects of the family planning
program.
iv.   Information, Education and Communications Program:  (a) equipment
for educational material production at the NFPB and the MOH and
audiovisual equipment for rural health centers and state MCH/FP
administrative centers, (b) advisory services for media produc-
tion at the NFPB (24 man-months), communications research at the
NFPB (21 man-months), and introduction of population education

ships for the NFPB, the MOH, and the FFPA information and health
education officers, (d) supplies of films on family planning
for the NFPB and the FFPA, (e) eleven mobile vans for state
MCH/FP centers with audiovisual equipment, 2 exhibition vans



- 10 -
and 1 landrover, and (f) curriculum development and teachers
training for population education, as well as information
material production at the NFPB and inservice training in
health education.
v.   Evaluation and Research:  (a) a mini computer including sorters
and punchers for the NFPB, desk calculators for the NFPB and
the University of Malaya (UN), (b) advisory service for popula-
tion research at the NFPB (60 man-months) and for the population
studies and research center at the UM (72 man-months) and for
medical records (6 man-months), (c) fellowships for UM staff
in demography and for FFPA staff in evaluation, (d) one vehicle
each for the NFPB and the UM, (f) research and seminars at the
UM, and (g) library books for the NFPB and the UM.
vi.   Intensive Input Demonstration:  (a) construction, equipment,
and furnishing of 365 midwifery clinic-cum-quarters (MCQs) in
the 14 demonstration districts, (b) 102 buses and 200 motorized
bicycles for supervisory nurses, and (c) local training of
midwives, production of information material, s- 'cial evaluation,
baseline surveys and applied nutrition program.
vii.   External Review:  A team of international consultants to be
appointed by the Government to review the program midway
through the project.
viii.   Project Implementation Committee:  The formation of the Project
Implementation Committee responsible for the administration of
the whole project and establishment of a unit for implementing
the construction component of the project.
A. Administration
4.02      The physical facilities of the project will provide MCHIFP centers
in 11 states with offices for both MCH/FP staff of the MOH and the NFPB re-
gional staff, along with accommodations for training, seminars and a library.
At present there is no center for family planning administration at the state
level. Administrative processes therefore are carried out separately and on
ad-hoc basis by the NFPB and the MOH. (Chart 7220) These would provide a
locus for family planning administration at state level to coordinate the
workings of the NFPB and the MOH by bringing them under one roof and under
the single monitoring of the State Medical and Health Officers, without
causing the NFPB to lose its identity. For effective supervision of family
planning services throughout the state, vehicles have been provided for the
NFPB and the rPrA staff in each state, as well as one for the head of the
MCH unit at the MOH.
4.03      Institutional and administrative improvements and additional per-
sonnel are extremely important at this stage of program development in West



- 11 -
Malaysia. The project, therefore, provides for a management study of the
family planning program by a professional firm. An MCH/FP adviser is also
provided in the project to assist with the technical aspects of integrating
family planning with MCH services. The MOH intends to create posts for
officers in each state responsible exclusively for MCH/FP services. The
NFPB needs a Deputy Director, preferably a social scientist or an admini-
strator, to assist the Director. To give the program a broader base and to
provide improved coordination of activities, the membership of the Coordina-
tion Committees at the central and state levels should include representatives
from the Ministries of Information and Broadcasting, National and Rural
Development, and Education. The terms of reference for these Committees
should be clearly defined and a mechanism should be established to give
effect to their recommendations. For better organization of the program a
comprehensive five-year family planning plan for 1976-80 should be prepared
by the NFPB and adopted by the Government. It would then become a commitment
to all ministries and agencies involved in the program. For the interim
period, 1973-75, a plan of action should be prepared covering all aspects
of the program and including extension of services to 90% of the rural
population as early as possible, but nct later than 1975.
4.04      Agreement has been reached during negotiations on all the points
mentioned in para. 4.03 specifically: (a) appointment of a firm to under-
take a management study midway throuh the project, (b) the appointment of a
MCH/FP adviser by June 30, 1973, (c) appointment of MCH/FP officers in all the
eleven states by December 31, 1973, (d) appointment of a Deputy Director of
the NFPB by April 30, 1973, (e) establishment of a mechanism for implement-
ing recommendations of the Central and State Coordination Committees by
June 30, 1973, and review of the membership of these Committees and defini-
tions of their terms of reference and (f) preparation of the five-year
family planning plan for 1976-80 in consultation with the Bank by January 31,
1974 and a plan of action for 1973-75 ensuring the coverage of 90% of the
population by 1975.
B. Services
4.05      Rural Services:  To improve the coverage of the rural population,
the project will expand significantly the space and equipment in most of
the rural health centers, as well as the number of mobile clinics. Many
rural health centers are so crowded that, at present, the NFPB or health
center staff must carry out family planning activities in a eorner of the
hall or even on the porch. There is no privacy during the clinic session
nor are there rooms for private consultations, sterilization operations,
or IUD services. Not only is the existing space at the health centers
inadequate, but also additional space will be required for the applied
nutrition program and group talks on health and family planning which are
planned to be an important part of MCH services. The nutrition program
would help,reduce the toddler mortality rate and also attract eligible
mothers to the clinics, thus providing opportunities for more ready accept-
ance of family planning. In all, 162 of the 245 existing health centers,



- 12 -
with average daily outpatient attendances of 20 or more during the last
three years, have been selected for additional clinic space. (Annex 3)
4.06      At present, the existing health center staff is servicing 234 remote
villages through subsidiary clinics. To improve the coverage of population,
the GOM is planning to construct additional health centers. Meanwhile, about
26 mobile MCH/FP service units, provided by the project, would cover the
remote population. These mobile units would service 26 of the 47 health
districts with populations exceeding 150,000. As a part of the project,
audiovisual equipment to be used with group talks and family planning films
will be provided for all health centers. The project also includes equipment
for IUD insertions at main health centers in rural areas, for pap smear tests
at urban hospital clinics, and for nutrition education at all rural health
units. At present, some of the staff members of the MCH unit at the MOH are
nottrained in public health, therefore, three one-year fellowships for the
masters degree program in public health are provided for the MOHX, in addition
to fellowships for short-term training for all state medical officers and
for MOH staff members at the central level.
4.07      Urban Services:  The project provides for the re- acement of existing
inadequate accommodations in the Government hospital clinics. Family planning
clinics in Government hospitals are the best strategic points to (a) provide
contraceptive services, such as sterilizations and IUD insertions, and (b)
approach maternity patients for face-to-face motivation. Most hospitals
are already suffering from lack of space and their operating theaters are
too busy for the scheduling of sterilization cases within a reasonable
period of time. At present, in some cases, the NFPB utilizes hospital
corridors or garages for its clinics; in other cases, no space at all is
available within the hospital premises. From the 44 clinics in these hospi-
tals, the 31 selected for replacement are those (a) with substandard facilities
or located outside the hospital premises; or (b) with a large number of
deliveries; and or (c) located too far away from the nearest health center.
(Annex 4) Fellowships for short-term study tours for NFPB nurses are
included in the project to help them to get a broader perspective of the
program.
C. Training
4.08      The project will greatly expand the existing capacity for in-service
training of paramedical personnel and will assist in the establishment of a
center for the production of training materials. Because of the limited
training capacities at the two existing RHTCs (at Jitra on the West Coast and
Rembau in the South), only 40% of the existing assistant nurses and 15% of
the midwives have completed in-service training. It is estimated that with
the existing training capacity, it will take about 17 years to cover the
backlog as about 2,500 assistant nurses and midwives are to be trained during
1972-75. Since family planning services will be a part of health services,
it is proposed that the training of staff for rural health services (which
include family planning) be expedited. One new RHTC, with a capacity of 60



- 13 -
students, is proposed for construction at Marang in the State of Trengganu
on the East Coast.  In addition, the existing RITC at Rembau would be expanded
to increase the intake by 36 students. The new school and the extension of
the existing one would increase the capacities of RHTCs by 288 annually over
the present total of 144. For effective teaching of courses in family plan-
ning, the project includes equipment for production of training material and
audiovisual equipment for the PHI, the RHTCs and for the schools of basic
nurses training. Vehicles are also provided for each of the three RHTCs for
field training of trainees.
4.09      To expedite the integration of family planning with MCH services,
the MOH is planning to organize four regional centers for short-term training
of paramedical staff. About 9 courses--each with a three-week duration and
accommodating 25 students--would be organized at each of the four centers
annually to prepare 900 students per year out of the total of 2,500. The
project includes the total cost of establishing these centers including
stipends, vehicles, salary support and other expenses, with the exception
of building rent. With the existing schedule, it will still take more than
two years to complete the training. Agreement has been reached during
negotiations that a schedule for completion of the short-term training of
paramedical staff will be prepared and sent to the Bank by June 1973.
D. Information, Education, and Communications
4.10      The project will strengthen and expand the information, education,
and communications activities of the NFPB, the MOH, the MOE, and the FFPA .
Each agency will reach different types of audiences by group talks supported
by films and slides, the distribution of printed material, posters and by
the introduction of population education in schools. The roles of the
organizations and other ministries are shown in Chart 7044. Equipment is
provided for establishing units at the NFPB and the MOH for production of
material such as posters, booklets, slides, and photos. While the NFPB will
concentrate on family planning material alone, the MOH will produce material
on health education and will obtain assistance from the NFPB concerning family
planning content. Two advisers are provided at the NFPB not only to assist
in the production of material but to test its response and conduct research
in communications. The project will also give salary support to additional
local personnel needed for the purpose. All MCH/FP clinics (245 existing
and 99 to be added during the next five years) will have audiovisual equipment
to support group talks. To reach more of the rural population, an additional
mobile van with equipment for each state is included in the project to support
present NFPB efforts. Audiovisual equipment is also provided for use at the
MFPA seminars and group talks for opinion leaders. The project includes all
components needed for the introduction of population education in the school
system, such as advisory services for curricula development, training of
teachers and printing of material. Agreement has been reached during nego-
tiations that population education will be introduced in the school system
not later than December 31, 1976.

E. Evaluation and Research
4.11      The project will establish two new and somewhat different popula-
tion research units to develop the capability for training and research in
population problems in the country. One unit within the Evaluation Division
of the NFPB will concentrate on onerational research relevant to program
evaluation, the other, at the Universitv of Malaya will deal with national
demographic problems and training. Both units will be furnished with compu-
tational equipment, library materials, and advisers. In addition, the
NFPB will be provided with a computer and the U.4 with fellowships fcr
the training of Malaysians. The management consulting firm, forming part
of the project, will also review the system of evaluation to suggest suit-
able modification. During negotiations, agreement has been reached that
research advisers at the NFPB will be appointed and a Population Studies
and Research Unit will be established at the TUniversity of Malaya by
June 30, 1973.
F.  Intensive Input Dewonstration Area
4.12      The project will provide  additionalfacilities, in 14 districts
where the family planning services are already integrated with health services
or where the decision to integrate shortly has been made. These additional
facilities will help to demonstrate the effect of intensity of various inputs
on the acceptance of family planning and therefore will facilitate the de-
velopment of long-term policies for the country as a whole. In all 14 districts
special family planning training will be given to midwives and trained
assistant nurses and vehie]es will be provided to health center staff to
permit closer supervision of activities at the peripheral units, i.e.,
the midwifery clinic-cum-quarters (MCOs), and to permit more home visiting
by midwives. Also, all MCQs will be enlarged by building separate quarters
for the resident midwives; the existing quarters will then be used for the
provision of broadened health services, including family planning.  (YAP 3732)
Detailed evaluation of this demonstration is an important part of the pro-
ject. (Annex 5)

5.02      Construction (including equipment and furniture ) accounts for 44%
of the project costs. Of the remaining costs, less than one-tenth represents
technical assistance and more than one-sixth local cost of printing and
training, in which the major items are the preparation of population educa-
tion material and the training of teachers and paramedical staff. The cost

5.03      The cost estimates for buildings are based on the assessment of
1971-72 area unit prices from current examples of building contracts recently
executed. They have been subsequently adjusted to reflect more economical
building standards.  The proposed method of project implementation which would
provide strict technical control over standards may fturther reduce costs. The
cost of construction is expected to vary between US$4 to US$7 per sq. ft. depend-
ing on the type and location of building. Furniture and equipment cost estimates
were reviewed for all the institutions in the project. Reasonable bulk costs
for these categories of goods have been included in the costs for each clinic,
training school and administration building and include Group I and Group 2
equipment. Group 3 equipment (small items supplied and put in position by
building users) is specifically excluded from these estimates. Cost of
imported items are net of duties from which the project will be exempted.
Also the cost of site surveys and building permit fees have been excluded.
The detailed cost estimates of physical project facilities are given in
Annex 7.
5.04      The estimates of the Bank-assisted components include an allowance
for contingencies, 10% per annum for physical and 4% per annum for price
escalation over the five-year period of the project. The estimated foreign
exchange component for buildings (30%) includes direct materials, the
estimated foreign exchange component of locally-produced materials, and the
depreciation of contractors' imported plant during the construction period.
Interest and related charges on the loan during the implementation period
through December 1978 have been included.
B. Proposed Financing
5.05      The project would be financed by a UNFPA grant of US$4.3 million,
a Bank loan of US$5.0 million, and a Government contribution of US$5.2
million. The external financing is arranged in parallel, with each donor
financing separate and identifiable project components. Items to be financed
by the UNFPA consist primarily of contraceptive supplies, training stipends,
the production of information material, certain vehicles, medical instruments
and various advisory services. The Bank loan will finance construction,
certain vehicles, audiovisual and computing equipment, and some advisory
services. Details of the items to be financed by each donor are set out
in Annexes 8 and 9.
5.06      The Bank loan will cover the foreign exchange component of the
Bank-assisted items in the project including interest and other charges. It
amounts to US$5.0 million, or 49% of the total cost of the Bank-assisted part
of the project. The total external contribution will cover the foreign
exchange cost of the project of US$7.4 million, plus local costs amounting
to about US$2.0 million. The following table summarizes the financing ar-
rangements:

The GON will contribute US$5.2  million in capital costs.  In addition,
an estimated US$1.4 million for incremental current costs resulting
from the project (Annex 10) will be borne by the GOM. The total GOM involve-
ment averages outt at just over US$1.0 million per year for the five-year
project period.  These additional budgetary requirements should be well
within the financial ability of the MOH.
C. Implementation
Project Imnlementation Committee
5.07      The proposed project will be implemented during 1973-78.  (Annex 11)
The NFPB will be mainly responsible for the administration of the project,
in particular the non-construction part. Since the project involves im-
plementation through a number of organizations and ministries the Govern-
ment will appoint a Project Implementation Committee to ensure effective
execution and implementation of the project. The Project Implementation
Conmittee will consist of a representative of the Economic Planning Unit,
the Director-General and the proposed Deputy Director of the NFPB, the
Director of Health Services, and representatives from the Planning and
Development Division of the MOH, the Ministry of Education, the University
of atlaya and the Treasury.  The representative of the Economic Planning
Unit will be the chairman of the committee. The Deputy Director of the NFPB
will be Executive Secretary of the Project Implementation Committee and the
Project Administrator. (Annex 12) The formation of the Project Implementa-
tion Committee is a condition of loan effectiveness.
Project Construction Unit
5.08      A Project Construction Unit will be established in the Ministry
of Health for the implementation of the construction component of the project.
An architect will be in charge of the Project Construction Unit; he will
be provided with an adequate number of technical personnel and facilities
necessary for efficient operation of the unit. Agreement has been reached
during negotiations that the Project Construction Unit will be established
by April 30, 1973.
Professional Services
5.09      The need to evaluate and establish economical building standards
for the project and closely supervise the implementation requires the



- 18 -
emplovment of professional manpower beyond the existing resources within
the Government. Therefore, agreement has been reached during negotiations
that the Government shall employ an architectural consultant not later than
April 30, 1973. Ile will have recognized expertise in health delivery and
family planning facilities and will be acceptable to the Bank and appointed
upon terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank.
Advisorv Services
5.10      The Government has agreed during negotiations to consult both the
Bank and the IJNFPA on appointments of MCH/FP advisers and the management
consulting firm and has further agreed that these advisers shall lhave quali-
fications and experience satisfactory to the Banl.  In the case of technical
advisers, to be provided through the TWUO and the UNESCO or appointed directly
by the Government, aoreement was reached during negotiations between the
GOM, the UNFPA and the Bank on their qualifications and terms of reference,
and no further consultations will be necessary. The agreed terms of reference
for these advisers are given in Annex 13.
Procurement
5.11      Contracts for furniture, equipment and vehicles require' for the
project and financed from the proceeds of the loan would be awarded on the
basis of international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's
guidelines.  Contracts for civil works w'ould be subject to local bidding pro-
cedures. According to Malaysian procedures for public work contracts, foreign
contractors will be allowed to bid. However, civil works consist mainly of
the construction of small buildings. It is spread over a 3-year period in
eleven states and grouping would be pcssible only in packages of say 20 to 30
units. With unit costs varying from US$3,000 to US$10,000, such contracts
are unlikely to attract foreign contractors. The annual workload of this project
will only represent a small proportion of the local construction industries'
annual capacity.
5.12      Local manufacturers of furniture, equipment and vehicles competing
for the supply of these items will be allowed a margin of preference of 15%
over the CIF landed costs of competing imports or the existing rates of import
duties, whichever is lower. The lists and estimates of furniture and equip-
ment prepared by the consultant would be approved by the Bank before procure-
ment. All procurement will be based on contract documents and bid packages
prepared by the consultants and approved by the Government and the Bank. The
consultants will also advise on and review tendering procedures, adjudication
of bids received and comment on contract awards. The details of their duties
with respect to procurement and supervision are given in Annex 12.
D. Disbursements
5.13      The loan would be disbursed agalnst:  (a) 100%/ of the CIF price
for directly imported and against the exfactory price of locally manufactured



- 19 -
special equipment, vehicles and furniture; (b) 70% of total cost for locally
procured but previously imported equipment, vehicles and furniture; (c) 90%
of foreign exchange expenditures for technical assistance; and (d) 30% of
the total cost for civil works and professional services. The disbursement
schedule is given in Annex 14.
VI.  SOCIO-ECONONIC ANALYSIS
6.01      The project will help the Government to achieve higher targets of
fertility decline than could be achieved without it. A faster reduction in
the rate of population growth will result in more rapid increases in per
capita income. In the long run, the project will assist in slowing the growth
of the labor force and in reducing unemployment. By extending family planning
services in poor (mainly rural) sections of the societv, the project will
help to equalize economic opportunities. Through its health and nutrition
components, the project will improve the mental and physical capabilities of
children and reduce maternal and child mortality and morbidity.
6.02      Quantitative projections of these benefits with any degree of
precision is difficult; yet other things being equal, it is expected that
by 1985 the project should help to reduce the birth rate to 21 instead of
to 26 as envisaged under the existing targets without the project. (Chart
7035) Consequently, the rate of natural increase of population may decline
to around 1.5% instead of 2% by 1985. These demographic effects of the
project would lead to further reductions in the birth rate after 1985
(Annex 15) and in 1990, the birth rate may correspond to a net reproduction
rate of 1 and result in achieving zero population growth sometime in the
next century.
6.03      ks a result of the realization of these demographic targets
through the project, average per capita income in 1985 would be about 5%
higher than otherwise, a benefit that would continue to grow thereafter.
To secure a comparable increase in per capita income through alternative
investments would, in most cases, require an investment that exceeds the
total cost of the project several times over. In addition, the estimated
reduction in the growth of the labor force of around 240,000 by the end of
the century would help reduce unemployment (currently estimated at around
250,000) and improve productivity. (Annex 16)
VII. AGREEMENTS REACIIED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      During loan negotiations, agreement was reached on the following
principal points:
(a)  The appointment of all additional officers, technical advisers
and consulting firms required for the project (para. 4.04, 4.11,
5.10 and 5.11);



- 20 -
(b)  the preparation of a five-year family planning plan (1976-80)9
a plan of action (1973-75) and a schedule of short-term train-
ing of paramedical staff (paras. 4.04 and 4.09);
(c)  the establishment of a mechanism for implementing the recom-
mendations of the Central and State Coordination Committees
(para. 4.04);
(d)  the introduction of population education in the school svstem
(para 4.10); and
(e)  the establishment of the Project Construction Unit; (para 5.03).
7.02      Conditions of loan effectiveness are the establishment of a
Project Implementation Committee (para 5.07) and the conclusion of arrange-
ments of UNFPA financial assistance to the project.
7.03      Subject to the assurances and fulfillment of conditions described
above, the proposed project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$ 5.0 million
for a term of 25 years including a ten-year grace period.

West Malaysia
Population Growth and Economic Development
1.        This annex attempts to (a) summarize the long-term demographic
trends in West Malaysia and (b) relate the recent trends in population
growth with growth in per capita income, unemployment and underemployment
in the country as a whole. The purpose of such an analysis is to illustrate
the implications of a high rate of population growth for long-term economic
development and reduction of unemployment. It is, of course, well-recog-
nized that social and economic implications of population growth are far
more extensive and basic than can be revealed in one or two simple variables
for which data are available. The social implications of relatively higher
fertility of lower income groups leading to perpetuation of inequality
in income distribution through inadequate nutrition, health and education,
is one example which cannot be demonstrated quantitatively because not
enough data are usually available for such analysis.
Population Size and Growth Rate
2.        The first census in 1911 reported the population of West Malaysia
at 2.3 million and according to the 1957 census the population had reached
6.3 million. Although the results of the 1970 census are not yet final,
the population is estimated at 9.3 million. Between 1957 and 1964, the
natural rate of population growth averaged more than 3%, and declined to
2.5% by 1970. (Table 1) This decline resulted from a decrease in the birth
rate from more than 46 in 1957 to 32 in 1970 and despite a simultaneous
decrease in the death rate from 12.4 per thousand to 7.2. This decline in
birth rate represents a genuine decline in fertility and not simply a change
in the age structure of population as the general fertility rate also de-
clined from 229 in 1957 to 157 in 1970. (Table 2)
3.        Recently, the country has been facing considerable difficulty in
reducing the general fertility rate because of inadecuate facilities to ex-
tend the program to rural areas. Between 1969 and 1970, the general fertil-
ity rate declined only from 163 to 157 and the birth rate from 33 to 32.
The task of reducing the birth rate is likely to become all the more diffi-
cult for the next several years because of the entry of an even larger
number of persons in the reproductive ages resulting from the postwar baby
boom.  The birth rate is estimated to have increased to 32.4 in 1971 and
may go as high as 35.3 in 1975 and to 37.6 in 1980 if current fertility
rates remain unchanged.  Consequently, the rate of population growth may
increase to about 2.8% in 1975 and to more than 3% in 1980.  Even largely
increased efforts in family planning can, therefore, only reduce the birth
rate moderately, due to the transitory but unfavorable effects of the age
distribution. Without an effective family planning program, however, it
is estimated that the population may reach 23 million by the year 2000.

Per Capita Income
4.        The impact of population growth on the growth rate of national
and per capita incomes during the last decade for Malaysia as a whole is
shown in the following table:

1/ The difference between the basic data figure of per capita GNP at
US$380 and that given in this table is due to the change in exchange
rate, revision of figures, and differences in prices and concepts. The
income is at 1965 prices.
Source: IBRD, Current Economic Position and Prospects of Malaysia, 1972,
Table 2.1.
5.        The wide fluctuations in the economy emanate from the structure
of the economy that relied heavily on the primary sector, mining and services.
About half of the income is generated from agriculture, forest-y and only
13% from the manufacturing sector of the economy. The recent slow down in
Malaysia's economy is reported to be due to "decline in exports caused by
a recession in foreign markets for tropical timbers, exceptiur.aliy low
prices for rubber, exhaustion of iron ore mines and a reductior. in tin out-
put.'t The domestic market, of course, is reported to have reco-ared signifi-
cantly from the depressed portion of 1969 and increased by sometlhing like
12% both in 1970 and 1971. This shows that a self-sustained stable rate of
economic growth that depends on the capacity to save and invest in the
economy would reouire a rapid industrialization and diversification of the
domestic economy. Thus, insofar as the high rate of population growth
inhibits rapid increases in savings and investment, there is an incompati-
bility between achieving these development objectives and the high popula-
tion growth rate.
Unemployment
6.        The official figures indicate an unemployment of 8% of the labor
force mainly concentrated in West Malaysia. The Second Five-Year Plarn
(1971-75) observes that "the pace of new job creation could not keep up
with the strong spurt in labor supply during the First Malaysian Plan
Period (1965-70)." As a result, unemployment rose from about 6.5% of the



ANNEX 2
Page 3 of 7
labor force at the start to about 8% at its close. In spite of 596,000 ad-
ditional jobs to be created in the Second Plan, or 3.2% per annum, about
324,000 persons are estimated to be unemployed in 1975. In other words,
the employment situation would not improve over the next five years in spite
of a large effort on the part of the Government. Any short fall in the
targets of the Second Plan would, of course, cause further deterioration.
Data are given in the table below.

7.        The fact that existing unemployment is largely due to the high
rate of population growth in the past is bbvious from the fact that it is
largely concentrated among the new entrants in the labor force. over 64%
of the total unemployed were in the 15-25 age group in 1962; by 1967 this
had risen sharply to exceed 75%. About 65% of the unemployed in 1967 were
first-time job seekers, up from 47% in 1962. In locational terms, serious
unemployment occurs in the urban areas where the rate is around 10%. Here
again, youth unemployment rates are very high. 1/ This phenomenon is
1/ Government of Malaysia, Second Malaysia Plan 1971-75, p. 99-101.

largely because of the migration of unemployed and underemployed young
persons from the rural areas, delays in development project implementation,
and the postwar baby boom. Similarly, about one-half of the labor force
is in the agricultural sector and more than one-third in services. Thus,
about 85% of the labor force is in occupations with heavy underemployment.
8.        The problem of underemployment is ecqually serious in West Malaysia.
The Second Plan again observes that in addition to overt and measured unem-
ployment there remains large numbers of workers in low productivity jobs
who are underemployed, in the sense of both low intensity of work as well
as low earning and income. In 1967, about 11% of the workers classi4tied
as employed were reported to be working less than 25 hours per week. Be-
sides the underemployed, there remain those not classified within the labor
force because they are not actively seeking jobs but would accept one if
offered. Some portion of 63,000 persons so identified in 1967 would be
likely to move into the active job market if labor demand grew brisk.

1.        In West Malaysia, family planning services are being integrated
with maternal and child health services for extension to the rural areas.
At this stage of program development, therefore, it is highly desirable
that the pattern and intensity of delivering family planning services and
new techniques of stimulating demand be tested and evaluated in limited
geographic areas. This type of demonstration would help in the develop-
ment of long-term policies along sound lines.
Method
2.        The facilities provided in these areas, in addition to those
provided for West Malaysia as a whole, are called intensive inputs.
These inputs would allow the following specific activities to be carried
out and would be continously evaluated for their impact on the number of
acceptors and ultimately on the births prevented in a given area:
a.   development of improved management procedures for the family
planning program;
b.   assessment of the adequacy and effectiveness of additional
physical facilities and manpower in the delivery system;
c.   determination of the extent and nature of the training required
for midwives;
d.   provision of a model set up for practical training of health
center staff from non-project areas;
e.   study of the integration of the family planning services with
the Government hospital functions;
f.   evaluation of new techniques of information and education; and
g.   streamlining of the evaluation system and development of the
system of generating data useful for program management.
Area
3.        To compare performance "before and after" and with and without
providing the additional inputs, 14 districts have been selected for the
provision of intensive inputs. The districts selected are those where
the Government has already integrated family planning with MCH services
or will be doing so shortly. The health centers involved in such demon-
strations are given in Table 1 while the areas are shown on Map 37321R.

Inputs
4.        In addition to the project's other components provided for in
the country as a whole, the demonstration component would include the
following special inputs:
IBRD
a.   Additional clinic space in existing midwifery clinic-cum-quarters
(MCQs) to provide minor health services, as well as to increase
the attendance and coverage of population. Detailed locations
are given in Table 2.
b.   Special management and research studies and surveys by the
research advisers and a management consulting firm.
UNFPA
c.   Special training for existing midwives and trained assistant
nurses (TANs) in family planning and other aspects of health.
d.   Vehicles for health center staff to supervise the activities at
MCQs and for midwives at MCQs to make home visits.
GOM
e.   Operating expenses for introducing applied nutrition education
(at the experimental stage in one district at present).
f.   Special information and education materials to be prepared by
the NFPB for response test.
g.   Continual evaluation of the performance and impact of the pro-
gram units by additional staff to strengthen the Evaluation
Unit.
h.   Filling all the vacant posts and creating posts for one TAN at
all 82 MHCs and SHCs and for clerks at 19 MHCs.
Administration
5.        The demonstation program would be administered jointly by the
MOH and the NFPB. The Project Administrator will be mainly responsible
for the whole program and specifically for the special information, evalua-
tion and research part of the program. In working out the details of the
demonstration program, the MOH and the NFPB would be helped by: (a) the
Project Implementation Committee, (b) the advisers for management, research
and communications, and MCH/FP integration.

Demographic Impact of the Project
1.        It is difficult to measure the demographic impact of the project
over a long period with any degree of certainty as many variables influenc-
ing the size of the family cannot be held constant. Further, the process
of change of family size norm is too complex and the project facilities in-
fluence only a part of it. At the same time, setting up some sort of
targets for fertility decline which should accompany the project is signifi-
cant for policy makers. On the one hand, it illustrates the efforts re-
quired for achieving the targets and, on the other, shows the implications
of the various demographic targets.
2.        This annex attempts to estimate (a) the targets of fertility de-
cline with the project facilities, (b) the relative demographic impact of
the existing and the proposed targets, (c) the additional number of births
to be prevented and woman-years of protection required and (d) the current
users and annual acceptors required for preventing these births with the
existing and proposed targets.
A. Targets of Fertility Decline
3.        With the improvements in the program through the project, it
should be possible to reduce the birth rate to 30.6 by 1975 and to 21 by
1985 that would imply a reduction in fertility to half of the 1970 level
by 1985. The existing targets are to reduce the birth rate to 32.6 by 1975
and to 26 by 1985. According to demographic indicators, it is unlikely
that without the project the GOM would be able to achieve the existing
target by 1985. It is more probable that the existing targets could only
be achieved with additional facilities provided in the project. Under these
circumstances, the demographic impact of the project as estimated here
would be the minimum.
4.        By 1990 the project assumes a decline in the crude birth rate to
less than 20. This would correspond to a net reproduction rate of 1.
While no targets of fertility decline beyond 1985 presently exists, it is
assumed, however, that by 1999 the GOM may be able to achieve a birth rate
of 20 or a net reproduction rate of 1.
B. Demographic Impact
Population Size, Growth Rate, and Fertility Rates
5.        Estimated demographic parameters with and without the project
are summarized through 1999 in the following table:

I Without the project.
II With the project.
6.        In 1970, the birth rate was estimated at 32.2 corresponding to a
total fertility of 4.8.  It is estimated that without the project the birth
rate would increase slightly to 32.6 in 1975 from 32.2 in 1970 despite a
decline of 8% in total fertility because of a larger proportion of persons
entering the reproductive ages due to the postwar baby boom. With the pro-
ject, however, total fertility is expected to decline by 13% thus reducing
the birth rate slightly to 30.6 by 1975. The existing target of reducing
the birth rate to 26 by 1985 would still give a growth rate of 2% per annum.
The birth rate if reduced to 21.3 by 1985 would result in a rate of popula-
tion growth of 1.5%. With the project, it is expected that total fertility
may be reduced to 2.2 by 1990, thus bringing the fertility close to a net
reproduction rate of 1 which would help stabilize the population in the
next century. Without the project, a NRR of 1 may not be achieved even by
the end of the century.
7.        As a result of the assumed declines in fertility, the population
would be smaller by 0.6 million or by about 5% in 1985 and by 1.h million
or by 8% in 1999 with the project than without it.
Age Structure
8.        As a result of a sharper decline in fertility, the age structure
of population would improve further with the project than without it.
Tables 1 and 2 (at the end of the annex) project the population by age and
sex through 1999. The results indicate that by 1985 only 34% of the popu-
lation would be under 14 years of age with the project as against 37%
without it. By the end of the century; only about one-fourth of the popu-
lation would be under 14 years of age with the project as against around
30% without it.



ANNEX 15
Page 3 of 11
C. Efforts Required
9.        An attempt is made to illustrate the efforts required to reduce
fertility with and without the project in terms of (a) births to be pre-
vented, (b) the recraired woman-years of protection, (c) the total users
of family planning methods needed for the required woman-years of protec-
tion, and (d) the number of acceptors to be recruited each year to give
the needed users and their distribution by region and clinic.
a.   Births to be prevented  The births to be prevented to achieve
the reduction in fertility with and without the project are given
in Table 3. It shows the (i) births needed to be prevented to
reduce fertility with and without the project and (ii) the births
to be prevented as a proportion of births with constant fertility.
A little less than one-third of the total births with constant
fertility will need to be prevented in 1975 with the project in-
stead of 27% without it. By 1985 less than 60% of the births
with constant fertility will have to be averted with che project
instead of more than 40% without it. The corresponding propor-
tions may go up to 64% and 58% by the end of the century.
b.   Current users  The number of woman-years of protection against
pregnancy that should be contributed by women practicing family
planning to prevent the required number of births is summarized
in Table 4. It constitutes more or less the same proportion of
women in the reproductive ages as the proportion of births to
be prevented. However, because of the discontinuation of practice,
the number of current users in a year must be larger than the
woman-years of protection in order to achieve the required woman-
years of protection. The number of current users needed has
been worked out assuming that (i) continuation rates reported for
the pill remain constant (Table 5), (ii) the pill will continue
to be the main method used, and (iii) composition of acceptors
by method and by continuation rate is the same for acceptors re-
gistered at clinics as for those practicing on their own. On
these assumptions, the estimates indicated that without the pro-
ject in 1973, about 28% of women in the reproductive ages should
be using family planning methods in the country as a whole. With
the project, the proportion should increase to about 32%. By
1985, about 60% of the woman should be using the methods for
reducing fertility according to targets with the project and 47%
for the targets without the project. (Table 6)
C.  Acceptors  The current users in a particular year consist of
(i) new acceptors, (ii) those who resume the practice after dis-
continuing, and (iii) those who continue. The required number
of acceptors (categories (i) and (ii)) for the country as a whole
are given in Table 7. For some time to come the majority of the
acceptors may be new, as the number already practicing family
planning is quite small. An attempt is made to estimate the re-
quired total number of acceptors in rural areas in each plan

period up to 1985 on the assumption that (i) the number of
acceptors in rural areas would be the same proportion as the
rural population (70%), (ii) the percentage of rural population
would decline from 70 at present to 65 in 1976-80 and to 60 in
1981-85. The data are given below:

10.       Only a certain proportion of the total acceptors listed above
wbuld be using clinic facilities. It is estimated that about 29% of the
births were averted by the program in 1970 when it was mainly confined to
urban areas.  Assuming that 80% of the raral acceptors and 30% of the urban
atceptors would use clinic facilities, the total acceptors required to be
registered at the clinics are given below.

11.       The above table shows that without the project about 742,000
acceptors are to be reached during 1971-75; that is close to the target of
600,000 already set by the NFP]B.  With the project, however, the attempt
should be to reach at least 863,000 during the period, or about an additional
40%.
12.       Usually the agencies responsible for program execution keep records
of the new cases registered at the clinics. For effective monitoring of the
progralm the agencies should keep records of the total current users and
acceptors (both new and old) in the clinics and check their number in the
country through a periodic survey.

ANNEX 16
aTge I of 2
West Malaysia
Economic and Social Impact of the Project
1.        This annex presents a simple order-of-ma gitude analysis of the
impact of the project in terms of (a) the increase in per capita income up
to 1985, (b) the slowing in the growth of the labor force to 1995 and 2000,
and (c) further reductions in child mortality and morbidity.
Per Capita Income
2.        The project would permit per capita income to rise more rapidly
than otherwise; this conclusion assumes, as we believe justified, that the
slowing of population growth induced by the project would have no effect on
the growth of national income. The following table shows the growth of per
capita income with and without the project, using the long-term growth in
national income assumed in the Government's perspective plan. 1/

3.        Therefore, as a result of the project, per capita income would
be around 1.6% higher in 1980 than without the project, and around 5%
higher by 1985.  To produce increases in per capita income of this magni-
tude would require increases in investment several times larger than the
total cost of the present project. A population project is thus a far
cheaper way of generating increases in per capita income than by invest-
ment in production facilities alone up to a certain extent.
Labor Force
4.        The effect on the labor force of slowing down population growth
begins to be felt only about 15 years later. The following table shows the
estimated difference in the size of the labor force in 1995 and 2000 with
and without the project.

ANNEX 16
Page 2 of 2
The most striking point is the very rapid slow-down realized between 1995
and 200C; this reflects the rapid build-up of births averted in the late
1970s and early 1980s.   By 2000 the labor force is estimated to be about
3% smaller than it otherwise would be. The most important effect of slowing
the growth of the labor force will be a slowing in the growth of unemployment,
now estimated at about 250,000, or 8% of the total labor force. With a labor
force of about 7 million in 2000, unemployment would run about 560,000 if the
present rate should continue. Since the project is estimated to reduce the
total labor force by nearly 240,000 by 2000, unemployment would be only about
one-half what it might be in the absence of the project.
Mortality, Morbidity, and Nutrition
5.        West Malaysia has made good progress in reducing infant and child
mortality in recent years, although the rates are still fairly high, especially
in rural areas. The following table shows the trends in toddler mortality
rate,i.e.,numbers of deaths of children 1-4 years per thousand of children
of that age among major ethnic groups. (The Malay ethnic groups are pre-
dominantly rural and the Chinese predominantly urban.)

The project facilities and services will have a rural bias, which should help
to prevent any further worsening of the relationship between rural and urban
child mortality.
7.        The project contains a small nutrition component, limited to
nutrition education. The relationship between malnutrition and infection
as well as mental development is now well-established. The combination Qf
strengthened MCH services, nutrition and health education, and family plan-
ning which the project will provide will help improve not only the chainces
of survival of children, but also their mental and physical health, and hope-
fully their school performance.  It is,of course,true that the health com-
ponents of the project will have demographic effects directly opposite to
those which constitute the project's principal objective, i.e.,a slowing in
the rate of population growth. Better health services and nutrition will
keep more people alive (especially children), although the strength of
this effect is difficult to estimate. The negative demographic effects of
keeping more people alive is certainly no reason against doing so; they
do, however, add urgency to the need to bring fertility under better control.
