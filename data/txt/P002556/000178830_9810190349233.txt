SUDAN
APPRAISAL OF THE SUDAN POWER PROJECT
CENTRAL ELECTRICITY AND WIATER CORPORATION (CEWC)
SUMMARY
i.        The Central Electricity and liater Corporation (CEWC) has applied
through the Sudan Government for a loan of US$24 million equivalent to
finance part of its 1966/67-1972/73 power expansion program. The total esti-
mated cost of the proposed Project including work already completed (costing
ESd1.7 million) would be LSd14.5 million (US$41.7 million). The proposed Bank
loan would meet the bulk of the foreign currency costs which total US$27.7
million equivalent.
ii.       The Project would consist of:
(a) The completion of a powerhouse at the Roseires Dam and the
installation of three 30 Mw generating units;
(b) The construction of a 490 km 220 kv transmission line, the
expansion of the existing 110 kv transmission system and the
installation of associated substation facilities;
(c) The installation of a 15 Mw gas turbine generating unit at
Khartoum;
(d) The provision of consulting services to assist in the improve-
ment of the organization and management of the Borrower.
The installations are required to meet a growing power demand in CEWC's major
system and are economically justified. The Project is technically sound, the
estimated cost is reasonable, the construction schedule is realistic and the
arrangements for engineering and supervision of construction and for manage-
ment consulting services are satisfactory.
iii.      Besides the proposed Project, CEWC plans to expand other generating,
transmission and distribution facilities and to take over small undertakings
presently operated by the Ministry of Works. The power expansion program
including the proposed Project during the six-year period 1967/68 through
1972/73 is estimated to cost LSd23.6 million (US$68 million).
iv.       During the same period CEWC plans to spend about 1Sd8.3 million
(US$24 million) for the improvement and expansion of its water supply sys-
tems. The total capital requirements for CEWC's power and water expansion
program for this six-year period would therefore amount to LSd3l.9 million
(US$92 million).
v.        These expenditures would be financed from the proposed Bank loan
of US$24 million equivalent, US$11.4 million equivalent as loans from the
Government and suppliers, and the balance from internal sources.



- ii -
vi.       The expansion program is in line with the Government's development
plans. Apart from the proposed Project, this program must be regarded as
tentative, since it will depend on the progress of the Government's develop-
m3nt program and on CEWC's resources.
vii.      The 1966 Act establishing the CEWC as an autonomous corporation
is generally acceptable, although certain provisions are not sufficiently
specific from a long-term point of view. The Government has agreed to
introduce, at the appropriate time, the necessary legislation to rectify
this.
viii.     The Borrower's organization is weak and there is a serious short-
age of experienced staff at aUl levels. However, CEWC has a competent General
Manager, who has taken a number of steps which should improve the situation,
and has in addition employed the services of a management consulting firm to
help establish the Corporation as a viable autonomous entity.
ix.       The Borrower's financial position deteriorated after tariffs were
reduced by the Government in 1963. CEWC increased tariffs with effect from
August 1, 1967. The resulting financial situatior should be satisfactory.
x.        If a loan is made, it would be necessary for the Bank to supervise
closely for some time the management, organization and staffing of CEWC.
xi.       The Project would be suitable for a Bank loan of US$24 million
equivalent for a term of 25 years including a grace period of about 5 years.



SUDAN
APPRAISAL OF THE SUDAN POWER PROJECT
CENTRAL ELECTRICITY AND WATER CORPORATION (CEWC)
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      This report covers the appraisal of a power project for which the
Sudan Government has requested the Bank's financial assistance. The Borrower
would be the Central Electricity and Water Corporation (CEWC). The total
estimated cost of the Project is about LSdlU.5 million (US$41.7 million),ex-
cluding interest during construction. The foreign exchange cost would amour'.
to LSd9.6 million equivalent (US$27.7 million) of which LSd8.4 million
(US$24 million) would be the basis for the proposed loan.
1.02      In 1961 the Bank, the International Development Association (IDA)
and the Kreditanstalt fuer Wiederaufbau (KFW) of Germany jointly provided
financing totaling about US$51 million equivalent to the Sudanese Govern-
ment for the construction of the Roseires Dam on the Blue Nile mainly for
irrigation purposes.  In 1963 the U.N. Tecial Fund financed a power survey
of the Sudan for which the Bank was the Executing Agency. The consultants,
Messrs. Merz and McLellan, conducting this survey concluded that the instal-
lation of generating units at the Roseires Dam would be the most economical
means of meeting the country's growing power demand. The substructure for
a powerhouse was subsequently included in the Roseires Dam Project and fi-
nanced from the existing loans, Bank Loan 284-SU, IDA Credit 2-SU and the
KFW loan, thus providing the basis for the present Project.
1.03      In September 1963 the Sudanese Government applied to the Bank for
a loan of about US$14 million to finance mainly thermal generating facil-
ities at Khartoum for the Central Electricity and Water Administration (CEWAX.
the predecessor of CEWC. When the German Government expressed interest in
financing this project through the KFW, the Sudanese authorities withdrew
their application to the Bank. Shortly before loan negotiations, the Sudanese
Government severed diplomatic relations with Germany and as a consequence
the loan did not materialize.
1.04      After this failure to obtain financing from Germany the Sudanese
Government renewed its application to the Bank and in December 1965 a Bank
mission went to Khartoum to appraise the Roseires power project.   However,
the mission was unable to obtain the financial information required to ccm-
plete its work. After the major shortcomings were remedied during 1966 a
second appraisal mission, consisting of Messrs. H. Huang, H. C. Hittmair and
A. A. M. Onslow, went to the Sudan in February/March 1967. The following
report is based on their findings and on additional information supplied by
CEWC and its consultants.
2. ELECTRICITY AND WATER SUPPLY IN THE SJDAN
2.01      The Republic of Sudan has an area of 2,500,000 km2 .and an esti-
mated population of about 13 million. Over 90 percent of the population liv-
in rural areas without electricity.  The remainder live in 68 tewns, of wh.c4



- 2 -
only 19 (total population of 750,000) have electricity supply. Thus only
6 percent of the total population live in a supply area.
2.02      CEWC is the chief electricity supply authority in the Sudan. It
operates hydroelectric, steam and diesel power plants with a total capacity
of 83 Mw. The Ministry of Works supplies the remainder, using small diesel
plants with an installed capacity of 13.5 Mw. CEWC also operates, on behalf
of the Government, the hydroelectric plant at the Khashm el Girba multipurpose
project built to provide irrigation and power for the people resettled from
land now submerged in the reservoir of the Aswan High Dam. The Ministry's
plnts and the Khashm el Girba station would be transferred to CEIJC within
the next two years.
2.03      A number of the larger industries operate their own power plants
with a total capacity of about 27 Mw. All of these have contracts with CEWC
for a partial supply of their requirements, except the Shell Refinery at PoIr'
Sudan, which has a standby supply from the Ministry of Works.
2.04      CEWC supplies water to the main population centers at the Khartouvm
area and Wad Medani and Semnar. The Ministry of Works also operates 20 small
enterprises in other towns which enterprises will be transferred to CEWC over
the next two to three years.
3. THE CENTRAL ELECTRICITY AND WATER CORPORATION (CEWC)
History
3.01      Public supply of electricity and water was first introduced in
the Sudan in 1906. From 1925 to 1952 a private company, the Sudan Light &
Power Company Limited (SL&PCo.), with headquarters in London, supplied the
Khartoum area. In 1952 the shareholders accepted a purchase offer from the
Sudanese Government and the company was nationalized. In 1959 SL&Co. was
transformed into the Central Electricity and Water Administration (CEWA), a
department under the Minister of lWorks. Finally in May 1966 it became CEWC,
an autonomous authority, by the enactment of the Central Electricity and Water
Corporation Act of 1966.
3.02      Dlring its operations as a private company, SL&PCo.'s financial and
technical policies were established and supervised by its owners in London.
After nationalization the Government retained the company's senior staff, who
were practically all expatriates, but the benefit of advice and appraisal of
performance by experienced public utility executives in London was no longer
available. In late 1964 CEWA was "Sudanized" and nearly all of its expatri.?t-
staff in the technical and financial field left. The present difficulties in
the organization and management of CEWC are in essence the result of these
developments.
CEWC Power and Water Installations
3.03      The Corporation is responsible for the generation, transmission
and distribution of power in the following areas:



- 3 -
(a) The Khartoum Area and the Blue Nile Area are supplied by the
Blue Nile Grid. The total installed generating capacity of
the system is 77 Mw comprising the Burri Thermal Station at
Khartoum (30 Mw steam and 22 Mw diesel), a 10 Mw diesel plant
at Wad Medani, and a 15 Mw hydroelectric plant at Sennar.
(b) The Northern Area at Atbara is supplied by a 6 Mw diesel plant.
(c) The Eastern Area is supplied by a power station at the Khashm
el Girba Dam with a total capacity of 15 Mw.
The proposed Project would supply the Blue Nile Grid.
3.04      As regards the Corporation's water supply operations, the ca-
pacity of the Khartoum system is 15 IMgd, the largest installation being
the h IMgd Mogren Water Works (ultimately 16 IMgd).  Wad Medani has a 2
DMgd and Sennar a 5 IMgd plant.
The CEWC Act
3.05      The 1966 Act establishing the tEWC as an autonomous corporation
is generally acceptable, although certain provisions (see paragraphs 3.08
and 8.09) are not sufficiently specific from a long-term point of view.
The Government has agreed to introduce, at the appropriate time, the neces-
sary legislation to rectify this.
Organization and Management
3.06      The Act provides for a Board of Directors consisting of seven
members. They are the General Manager, one representative of the Ministry
of Finance and Economics and five other members who are appointed by the
Council of Ministers on the recommendation of the Minister of Works and
who hold office for a period of five years and are eligible for re-appointment.
The Council of Ministers also appoints one of the five appointed members of
the Board to be Chairman.
3.07      The five appointed members of the Board were appointed in April
1966. They are three businessmen, a public administrator and a university
professor and are well qualified for their work. To date the Board has been
mainly concerned with policy matters and the organizational structure of
the CEWC.
3.08      The Act requires the General Manager to be appointed by the Council
of Ministers, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Works after
consultation with the Board of Directors, for a term of five years. He is
eligible for re-appointment. The Act states that the General Manager is the
chief executive officer of the Corporation but does not specify his duties.
The Board has already delegated full administrative powers to the General
Manager, which is adequate for the present, but the Government has agreed
that at a later date the Act will be amended in line with the following:
The General Manager shall, subject to the direction of the Board on matters
of policy, be charged with the direction of the business of the CETC, its ad-
ministration and organization, and the administrative control of its employees.



3.09      The General Manager has been in office since late 1964.  He is
an engineer with considerable experience in the public utility field and
a competent administrator. In view of the organizational weakness of the
Corporation and the fact that improvements will take time to materialize,
it is essential that the post of General Manager be filled by a competent
and experienced person. During negotiations an assurance was obtained
that during the life of the loan the Bank will be consulted before subse-
quent appointments to this post are made.
3.10      The scarcity of experienced staff at all levels and in all
departments is a basic problem of the CEWC. The Corporation is trying
to cope with this problem by recruiting new qualified and experienced
staff and by training its own employees. An expatriate Chief Electrical
Engineer has recently been appointed. CEWC has agreed that every effort
will be made to recruit experienced personnel to fill key posts at all
levels and that its present training scheme, which so far has had limited
results, will be expanded with the assistance of the management consult-
ants.  CEWC has also agreed that during the life of the loan the Bank will
be consulted before new appointments to the posts of Chief Electrical
Engineer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Civil Engineer are made.
3.11      Soon after the Corporation was established the Board realized
that management and organization would have to be improved and it appointed
a management consulting firm (Middle West Service Company of Chicago) to
make a review. A report was submitted to the Corporation in December 1966
with a long list of recommendations.  CEWC has agreed to continue to employ
this firm to assist in putting the recommendations into effect (paragraph
6.10). The terms of reference are satisfactory to the Bank.
3.12      In summary, CEWC's organization is weak and there is an acute
shortage of staff at all levels. Tris is the most serious problem CEWC
is facing at the moment. CEWC's General Manager has taken a number of
steps which should improve the situation. A continuation of these en-
deavors with the help of consultants under the close supervision of the
Bank should enable CEWC to develop and establish a proper organization
during the construction period of the Project, which would enable it to
perform its functions effectively.
4. THE POWER MARKET
Past Energy Sales
4.01      Sales by CEWC during the past five years increased at an average
rate of 16.4 percent per annum (see Annex 1). The increase in the Blue Nile
Area was the highest, being 24.3 percent, and was due to the development of
the Gezira irrigation area. The average rate of increase in the Khartoum
Area was 14.8 percent per annum and in the Northern Area 18.2 percent per
annum.



- 5 -
4.02      During the fiscal year 1966/67 CEWC sold a total of 204 million
kwh to some 52,900 consumers. A breakdown of these figures by areas is as
follows:
Sales in         Percentage  Number of
millions of kwh      of total   Consumers

Sales Forecast
4.04      A forecast of energy sales for the six-year period 1967/68-
1972/73 is shown in Annex 1. In the past CEWC was not able to keep satis-
factory statistics and it is therefore difficult to establish past trends
and make realistic sales forecasts. However, the estimates prepared by CE7vC
are considered reasonable and sufficiently reliable to provide a basis for
financial projections and future development planning.
4.05      During the forecast period the Khartoum Area and the Blue Nile
Area show average annual increase rates of 15.0 percent and 19.8 percent
respectively. The growth rate for the Blue Nile Grid which supplies both
areas wiould be 16.0 percent per annum. The Northern Area is expected to
develop at a slower pace with an average annual rate of increase of 7.0
percent. For comments on the forecast in each area see notes attached to
Annex 1.



-6-
Load Growth
4.06      System demand in the Blue Nile Grid has increased from 20 MW in
1962 to 48.5 Mw in 1967 at an average rate of 19.5 percent per annum. An
estimate of system demand through 1973, based on the sales forecast, is
shown i.n Annex 2. The demand is expected to reach about 110 MwJ in 1973
representing an average increase per annum of about 14.5 percent during
the period 1967/68-1972/73.
4.07      The power demand in the Northern Area was about 4 Mw during
1965/66. It is expected to increase at an average rate of about 8 per-
cent per annum and reach some 7 Nw by 1973.
Installation Programs
4.08      In order to meet the expected increase in system demand of the
Blue Nile Grid during the next several years the CEWC plans to install
additional generating capacity and to expand transmission facilities.
chart showing estimated system demand and plant capability is attached as
Annex 3. Three 30SW: generating units at the Roseires Dam together with
associated transmission facilities are scheduled to commence operation
before mid-1971. As an interim measure a 15 Mw gas turbine generating
unit is to be installed at Khartoum for opr;ation by April 1969. Additional
similar units would be installed later as required. These gas turbines
serve to supply firm capacity during the dry season to augment supply from
Roseires and to provide standby capacity in the event of an outage of the
Roseires-Khartoum transmission line. The three 30 MW units at Roseires,
the associated transmission system, and the first 15 Mar gas turbine are
included in the Project proposed for Bank financing.
4.09      A 2 Mw diesel generating unit is being installed in the Northern
Area and is scheduled to be ir operation within a few months. Another
similar unit is to be installed and in operation by 1969.
5. THE WATER MARKET
5.01      The findings in this report on the Water Department are based on
information obtained from the Corporation's staff on the Department's oper-
ations and plans for future development and on discussions with the General
Manager. No attempt was made by the mission to appraise in detail the water
supply operations of the CEWC, since the water supply situation has recently
been reviewed by a U.K. consulting firm (Howard Humphreys). Their report
on water distribution and resources for the Khartoum area is expected shortly.
Although the Water Department represents only about 20 percent of the whole
undertaking, its operation has a noticeable effect on the finances of the
Corporation. This is recognized by the General Manager who agrees that more
attention will have to be paid in future to the comercial and financial op-
erations of this Department.



- 7 -
5.02      Water sales in the Khartoum Area, which is the most important one
supplied by CEWC, have increased at the rate of almost 15 percent per annum
in the past with the exception of the last three years when supply was partly
restricted because of the delay in the completion of the Mogren Water Works
in Khartoum. CEWC has assumed a lower expansion increase of 10 percent per
annum for the future. For Wad Medani and Sennar, the sales forecast show
growth rates of 5 and 15 percent per annum respectively for the next Sa-
years and are based on past results.
5.03      For the other water supply systems which CEWC will have to take
over soon from the Ministry of Public Works (see paragraph 2.04) very limit.ed
records were available and it was impossible to produce a forecast of sales;
the notes to the financial projections (see Annex 7) explain the assumptions
made in order to incorporate the future results of these systems into the
forecasts.
6. THE PROJECT
Description
6.01      The Project would be the most important part of CEWC's power pro-
gram for the next sixit years, representing about 55 percent of the total
estimated expenditure (paragraph 7.01), and comprises four main items:
(a) The completion of a powerhouse at the Roseires Dam and the
installation of three 30 M* generating units;
(b) The construction of 220 kv and 110 kv transmission lines and the
installation of associated substation facilities;
(c) The installation of a 15 Mw gas turbine generating unit at Khartcum.;
(d) The provision of consulting services to assist in improving organ-
ization and management.
6.02      The powerhouse is located downstream of the Roseires Dam 1/.
The substructure of the powerhouse, which has been designed to accommodate
seven generating units, has been constructed with the proceeds of the exist-
ing loans for the Roseires irrigation project. Under the proposed Project
a superstructure to house three 30 Mw generating units would be added and
the three units would be installed. The water turbines would be of the
Kaplan type, designed to run at 136 rpm and to operate under a net head
ranging from 17 to 48 meters. This range is necessary as the height of the
dam is to be increased by ten meters in Stage II of the Roseires reservoir
development. The alternator would be rated at 33.3 l4va at 0.9 power factor
and would generate at 11 kv. 50 cycles per second.   The generator voltage
would be stepped up to 220 kv and fed into the transmission system.
1/ For details of the dam see Appraisal Report TO-277a on the Roseires
Irrigation Project, June 7, 1961.



6.03      The 220 kv transmission system would consist of a single circuit
220 kv transmission line, about 490 km long, to connect the Roseires power-
bouse to the existing substation at Khartoum called Kilo X. The line would
also be connected to an existing substation at Meringan about midway between
Roseires and Khartoum.
6.04      A 220/110 kv 100 Mva transformer and a 110/33 kv 12.5 Mva trans-
former, and associated switchgear would be installed at the Khartoum sub-
station. A 220/n1O kv 40 Mva transformer and associated switchgear would
be installed at the Meringan substation.
6.05      A double circuit 10 kv transmission line, about 16 km in length.
would be constructed to connect the Khartoum substation to a new substation
at the Khartoum North industrial area. This new substation would be provided
with three 30 Mva step-down transformers with associated llO kv and 33 kv
switchgear.
6.06      A gas turbine plant with one unit of about 15 Mw capacity would
be installed at the Khartoum substation. It would be designed for quick
starting and would use light diesel fuel oil.
Status of Engineering and Procurement
6.07      CEWC has engaged four consulting engineering firms to -design and
supervise the constructionof the Project:  Sir Alexander Gibb & Partners
and Coyne & Bellier, the designers of tthe Roseires Dam, for the civil engi-
neering work of the powerhouse and the gate equipment, Merz and McLellan
for the three 30 Mw generating units and associated electrical and mechanical
equipment within the powerhouse, and Societe Generale pour L'Industrie for
the transmission lines and substations and the gas turbine plant. CEJC has
agreed that consultants satisfactory to the Bank will continue to be employed
to design and supervise the construction of the Project.
6.08      All contracts will be awarded on the basis of international com-
petition. Detailed design work by the Consultants is well advanced. Speci-
fications and tender documents for all the major equipment have been approved
by the Bank. A contract has been-awarded for a gas turbine.   Other equipment
tenders have been received and are being evaluated by the Consultants. Con-
tractors for the civil engineering works have been prequalified and bids will
be called shortly. The basis of disbursements would be the foreign currency
costs of imported equipment and services only. Expenditures prior to the
date of the loan would not be eligible for reimbursement and if savings are
made any excess loan funds would be available for cancellation.
Construction Schedule
6.09      According to the construction schedule prepared by the Consultants
the first Roseires generating unit should be commissioned in January 1971,
the second in March 1971 and the third in May 1971. The transmission-lines
and the substations should be ready by the time the first unit is completed.
The gas turbine plant is scheduled for operation before April 1969 in time
to meet the annual peak of that year. These target dates are reasonable.

Management Consulting Services
6.10      CEWC has signed a further contract, initially for one year with
provision for further extensions, with the Middle West Service Company pro-
viding the following services: assistance in reorganizing, recruiting and
training of personnel; setting up an accounting system with the use of a
computer; instituting a budgetary control system; reviewing financial fore-
casts and assisting in making an inventory of assets. At a later date, but
prior to completion of the Project, a tariff study would be carried out by
consultants.
Estimated Costs
6.11      The total estimated cost of the Project is US$41.7 million equiva-
lent with a foreign exchange cost component of US$27.7 million equivalent.
A Bank loan of US$24.0 million has been requested to cover the major portion
of the foreign currency requirements. Details of the cost are shown in
Annex 4 and summarized below:

6.12      As showqn above, the total cost includes the following three itemst
(I) the cost of the powerhouse substructure which is financed in part under
the irrigation loans (paragraph 1.02) estimated at LSd880,000 in foreign
currency and LSd474,000in local currency; (II) the cost of three draft-tube
gates, amounting to LSd7O,000 in foreign currency, which CEWC has purchased
with its own funds, to be installed in the substructure; and (III) LSd327,00O
of engineering fees in foreign currency which CEWC has paid to its Consultants.

6.i3      Plant and equipment costs are based on tender prices which
are now being evaluated. The cost estimates for civil works and for trans-
mission line construction are based on the cost of work of a similar nature
recently completed or under construction in the Sudan. A contingency sum
of about 10 percent has been included to allow for possible escalation in
material and labor costs and ocean freight, which should be adequate.
Plant Operation and Energy Output
6.14      During the greater part of the year Roseires power station would
be operated as a base load station to supply the bulk of energy requirement
of the Blue Nile Grid. However, during the dry period March to May, the
station would supply peak power and the thermal plants would carry the base
load. It has been estimated that, for the present Stage I Roseires reservoir
development, the three generating units would give an energy output of about
600 million kwh in an average year and about 572 million kwh in a dry year.
For discussions on the operation of the reservoir and the station, see Annex
5.
Coordination
6.15      The primary purpose of the Roseires reservoir is to serve the
needs of irrigation. In the operation of the reservoir priority must,
therefore, be given to these needs. However, by proper management optimum
benefits to both power generation and irrigation can be produced without
prejudicing the requirements of the latter. This calls for good planning
based on careful studies of the river regime, weather information, irrigation
patterns, load conditions, etc., as well as close coordination among the
major water users. In the Ministry of Irrigation and Hydroelectric Power,
there is a Technical Committee for the utilization of Nile Waters which is
responsible for formulating the policy for the operation of the Roseires
Dam and for determining the distribution of the impounded water among the
major water users. To look after the interest of power generation, the
General Manager of CEWC has recently been appointed a member of this Com-
mittee. Furthermore, the resident engineer of CEWC Roseires power station
has been included in another committee established at the operating level
for implementing the decisions of the Technical Committee. These arrange-
ments are satisfactory.
Econcmic Justification
6.16      Because the project for the Roseires Dam and reservoir was justi-
fied on the basis of irrigation benefits alone, the Government has not re-
quired the CEWC to share the cost of the dam. Although the firm capacity
of the Roseires power station would be small during the dry season, the
station could supply a large proportion of the annual energy requirements
of the Blue Nile Grid and thus save considerable foreign currency expenditure
on expensive imported fuel oil. Therefore, despite its long distance from
the load centers which necessitates large investment in transmission lines,
the power Project is economically attractive.



- 11 -
6.17      The Consultants' report on Sudan power development (see paragraph
1.02) concluded that installation of generating units at the Roseires Dam
would be the most economical means of meeting the power needs of the country.
Subsequently, the Bank reviewed the report and confirmed the findings of the
Consultants. It found that an economic comparison between the Roseires scheme
and the second best alternative, an all thermal scheme, showed on a discounted
cash flow basis a clear advantage for the RDseires scheme; the discount rate
to equalize the cash outlays under the two schemes would be as high as 20 per-
cent (with fuel oil at present prices).
7.  CEWC'S EXPANSION PROGRAM FOR ELECTRICITY AND WATER SUPPLY
7.01      In addition to the proposed Project and the specific installations
for the Nile Grid system mentioned in paragraph 4.08 CEWC is planning to ex-
pand the distribution and transmission systems in its various supply areas,
to increase existing generating plant capacity and to supply 18 towns which
presently have no electricity supply. In the financial forecasts the fol-
lowing provisions for capital expenditures and power projects were made for
the six-year period 1967/68-1972/73:
Expenditures in   Estimated fiscal years
millions of bSd      of expenditures
(a) The Project                      12.81'            1968-1973
(b)  Installation of a second gas
turbine at Khartoum             .7              1971-1973
(c)  Electrification of 18 towns        .8             1968-1973
(d) Extension to existing diesel
stations                         .2             1968-1969

over from Ministry of Works   1.4               1969-1973
(i) General assets                    1.1              1968-1973
TOTAL                         23.6
l/  ESdl.7 million has already been expended to June 30, 1967,
giving a total of LSdl4.5 million for the Project.



- 12 -
7.02      The expenditures for water installations can be summarized as
follows:
Expenditures in    Estimated fiscal years
millions of 1Sd       of expenditures
(a) The completion of the Mogren
Water Works, and new water
works at Khartoum and
Gedaref                        2.2              1968-1973
(b) The expansion of water dis-
tribution systems in
existing areas and exten-
sion into new areas            3.8              1968-1973
(c) Extension of undertakings
taken over from Ministry
of Works                        .9              1970-1973
(d)  General assets                    .1              1968-1973
(e) Other miscellaneous
expenditures                   1.3              1972-1973
TOTAL                          8.3
7.03      The estimated capital expenditure program should be regarded as
a maximum program and as such it will test the adequacy of CEWOC's financial
resources. Some of the items are dependent on certain Government develop-
ment projects which might affect their timing and make for later completion
dates.  On the other hand, CE-C might well want to defer capital expenditures,
should the expected financial results not materialize, until such time as
other financing can be arranged. The annual review of CEWC's financing plan
and its review by outside consultants (see paragraph 8.21) should put particu-
lar emphasis on the Corporation's capital expenditure program.

S. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
General Observations
3.01      The main difficulty in appraising CEWJC's finances lies in the
lack of reliable and coherent information on past performance. The
fragmentation of financial information into departmental and regional
categories without a Droper meaningful consolidation contributed to the
breakdown of the renorting system necessary to supply the basic infor-
mation for the management of CEWC to reach financial decisions and also
for a proper apnraisal.
3.02      The historical developments described in paragraph 3.02 affected
in particular the financial management of the entity.  The unavailability
of advice and direction from London headquarters after the nationalization
and the weakening of the financial organization after "Sudanization" led
to a critical situation in 1965. With the aid of consultants, the
situation has since been improved and further use of consultants is being
made in recruiting, training or seconding financial personnel.
Accounting and Audits
8.03      CEWOC's accounts are presented in accordance with accepted
public utility practices. The financial situation is shown on a regional
basis and is, in addition, broken down for each region into departmental
accounts (electricity generation and transmission, electricity distribution,
Dublic lighting, water purification, water distribution, and various minor
departments). While this system should be continued,to facilitate proper
costing and budgeting procedures it will be necessary in future to produce
a consolidation of CEWC's results to provide a basis for judging its
performance as an autonomous entity.  Any financial commitments under the
oronosed loan should be based on a full consolidation of CEDC's financial
situation and results.  The financial analysis of this report is based
on this concept and a consolidation of the Company's financial statements
was prepared by the appraisal mission.
8.04      At the time of the appraisal mission in December 1965 CEWA
had just closed its books for the fiscal year 1962/63. The information
on the two subsequent years was incomplete and more recent data practically
unavailable. In a commendable effort the Corporation was able to bring
its books up to date during 1966. Particular attention should be paid
in the future to CEWC keeping its accounts up to date either with its
own staff or, if required, by enlisting the help of outside accountants.
The Bank would keep a close control over this aspect.
8.05      As a Government department CEWA's accounts were audited in the
past by the Auditor General's staff.  The CEWC Act now requires an annual
audit by an auditor appointed by the Corporation's Board with the approval
of the Minister of Works. The Loan Agreement for the proposed loan



- 14-
contains a provision for such an annual audit by an independent outside
auditor acceptable to the Bank. The audit must be completed within
five months after the close of each fiscal year. For the audits of the
1965/66 and 1966/67 accounts a qualified local firm of auditors has been
appointed; the audit for 1965/66 has been completed, but not that for
1966/67.
8.06      Despite the shortcomings in the available financial data for
the past it was decided to proceed with the presentation of this Project and
so avoid a further long delay in the Project. The financial figures for
the past years to 1966 were reviewed carefully by the appraisal mission
and also by CEWC's management consultants in the course of their tariff
study.
Tariffs
8.07      In accordance with the Act CEMC s Board shall from time to time
submit tariffs for power and water supply to the Minister of Works who
has to consult with the Minister of Finance and Economics prior to giving
his approval. As general guide'lines for the Board in setting tariffs the
financial section of the Act states that the Corporation should be
operated on a connercial basis, should not be run at a loss and that
surpluses would be permissible to create a general reserve. A further
clarification of the Government's tariff policies was given in a resolution
of the Council of Ministers in September 1966 where it was agreed in
principle that CEW1C should increase its tariffs so as to finance a larger
share of its expansion program from its own resources and thus be less
dependent on the Government's budgetary contributions.
3.08      CElIC asked its management consultants to work out tariff
proposals for power and water supply in its various regions. The con-
sultants' study was accepted with modifications and new tariffs were put
into effect on August 1, 1967. The new tariff schedules basically re-
establish tariff levels which were in existence prior to 1963 when an
arbitrary rate reduction was ordered by the Government. The consultants'
study was based on the analysis of the results of only one year (fiscal
year 1966) and did not attempt to project the effects of the increase
on CEWC s future finances. It is however the first attempt for years
to set tariffs on a proper basis. The tariff increase should provide
an appropriate financial base for Ch7qC and for the execution of the
Project.
8.09      A rate of return concept has been adopted for the tariff
covenant of the proposed loan, Tariffs for the sale of power and water
should result in revenues sufficient to cover all operating costs
including adequate depreciation and to produce a reasonable return on
CYWC's properly valued, consolidated net fixed assets in operation.



- 15 -
During the construction period of the Project the new tariffs are
considered as meeting the requirements of the Bank and no reductions
are to be made without Bank approval. After a fixed assets valuation
study (paragraph 8 12) has been completed, an1 after the varicus isolted rxtlr-
orises and systems have been taken over by CEWC, the tariff situation is
to be reviewed again. At the latest, prior to the completion of the
Roseires Power Project, a complete tariff study is to be made which will
determine appropriate future return levels acceptable to CEWC and the
Bank. An overall minimum return of 8 percent would seem reasonable and
has been used in the Loan Documents. Although these rate of return
requirements would not be inconsistent with the provisions of the CEWOC
Act, it is considered preferable that an amendment should be made to the
Act at an appropriate time, and assurances to do this have been received
(see paragitaph 3.05).
8.10      The average revenue obtained from the previous electricity
tariffs was 14.8 mms/kwh (US4.2/). The new tariffs would increase it to
16.0 mms/kwh (US4.6¢) in fiscal year 1969. The water operations of
CEWC have been less profitable and have just about broken even with
average revenues of 31.0 mms/m3 (US8.?,2.   The increase in the Khartoum
Area would bring revenues to 34.9 mms/m.J (US10.0/). No reduction in
rates is forecast on the assumption that water operation should not be
unduly subsidized from the Corporation's power operations.
8.11      Power and water rates in the small isolated systems which will
be taken over by CEWC presently run as high as 70 mms/kwh (US20¢) and
100 mms/cu m (US29¢). An appropriate assessment of these rates can only
be made after the valuation of their fixed assets and after the intro-
duction of commercial accounting for their financial operations.
Present Financial Position
8.12      Balance sheets as at June 30, 1964 through 1967, are shown in
Annex 6. An adjusted summarized balance sheet as at June 30, 1967,(Annex 9)

- 16 -
The valuation of the fixed assets in operation is open to some doubt
since the original cost of the assets taken over in 1952 from the
SL&PCo. was based upon the share value at that time. In view of this
method of valuation it can be assumed the depreciation reserve is
probably too low. CEWC has agreed that the Consultants assist in the
preparation of an inventory of its fixed assets and their valuation.
The new tariff to be introduced prior to the completion of the Project
will be based on this.
8.13      CBIC's capitalization consisted of a total of 1Sd22.8 million,
of which 1Sdl7.8 million represented Sudan Government advances and the
remainder accumulated earned surplus, apart from a long-term debt for
the Roseieres Powerhouse substructure. The Sudan Government advances
originated at the time when the assets of the SL&PCo. were vested with
CEWA in 1959 and subsequently on takeover of other assets and when the
Government budget was the only source of funds available to CEUA. lIo
repayments are envisaged for these capital advances and interest is to
be paid at rates fixed by the Ministry of Finance. In the past, 4 per-
cent interest has been charged on about ;Sdl2 million, while the remainder
carried interest at 6 percent reflecting the higher interest rates the
Government had to pay in raising these funds.  Starting with fiscal
year 1968, 4 percent would be payable on ISd7.4 million and 6 percent
on the balance. It has been confirmed that no repayment is required
until such time as the Government and the Bank shall agree that the
financial condition of the CEWC warrants such repayment.
8.14      The current position of CEWO as of June 30, 1967, is character-
ized by a large amount of accounts receivable (16Sd6.1 million) and of
interest payable (LSd3,l million), due mainly to the Corporation's
financial transactions with the Government. In the past the Government
has been slow to pay its bills for supplies and services by CEWC and to
make available budgetary contributions and other compensation payments
to which it had agreed. CEWC on the other hand held back payments of
interest on Government advances, of customs duties and other smaller
debts to Government departments. During negotiations, the Government
and CEWC agreed a general settlement would be made which as of the end
of the last fiscal year would result in a cash payment of LSd87,000
by the Government to CEWC, and that settlements would be made in future
each half year.
8.15      Another important block of accounts receivable are the
delinquent consumer accounts. The explanation for this is that in early
1965 CEWC's billing machines broke down and it was impossible for several
months to have them repaired. CEWC has only recently been able to catch
up with the billing backlog and appears to be in difficulties in collec-
ting some of the arrears despite a concerted effort by CEWC's management.



- 17 -
Since January 1, 1967, a 60-day cut-off provision has been reintroduced
and is being enforced. This is helping to improve the situation and
should assure an acceptable management of collections in the future.
8.16      After making adjustments for the settlement with the Government
and discounting the outstanding consumers accounts receivable for possible
bad debts the current position of CEWC would still be acceptable. The
cash balance of =Sdl4l,OOO as of June 30, 1967, is adequate.
Past Operating Results

1964   1965   1966   1967
Operating revenues                    3.2    3.4    3.7    4.0
Operating cost                        2.1    2.3    2.5    2.9
Net income from operations            1.1    1.1    1.2    1.1
Return on investment                  6.6%   5.4%   5.8%   4.4%
The low level of earnings was due to a reduction in tariffs decreed by
the Government without consultation with CEWA, which became effective in
July 1963. The drop in returns in 1965, 1966 and 1967 was mainly due to
CEWA's water operations which barely broke even in fiscal years 1966 and
1967. The political changes towards the end of calendar year 1964 and
the staffing and accounting problems after the "Sudanization" of the
Corporation in 1965 contributed to this deterioration.
8.18      After it became clear that the 1963 tariff reduction would
dangerously weaken CEVA's financial position a resolution was passed by
the Council of Ministers to compensate for the resulting loss in revenues.
These amounts are shown in the income statements but are not considered
for rate of return calculations. The Government has included these
amounts in the settlement as of June 30, 1967. Following the tariff
increase as of August 1, 1967, there is no further need for this subsidy
which has been discontinued.
8.19      During the three years 1964 through 1966, CEWC invested approxi-
mately LSd6 million, 45 percent of which came from its own resources, the
Government providing advances for the balance. With the much higher
estimated capital requirements for the next years the previous level of
earnings would be inadequate and the tariff increase was therefore
required to cover the debt service and still provide capital contributions.



Proposed Finarncing Plan
8.20      A forecast of Sources and Application of Funds 1968 to 1973
is shown in Annex 8. The projections are based on the forecast income
statements presented in Annex 7 and on the capital expenditure program
for the same period. The financing during the construction period of the
Project (1968 to 1973) can be summarized as follows:
Financial Requirements:                          in thousands of LSd
Construction expenditures:
Powerhouse civil works                       1,285
Remainder of proposed Project               11,512
Total of Project                       12,797 J1/
Other expenditures                          19,081
Total construction expenditures        31,878
Debt service                                        10,282
Increase in cash balance (net)                      1,724
Total requirements                     43,884
Would be met from:
Internal cash generation                           31,566
Borrowings:
Proposed Bank loan                           8,362
Supplierst credits                             550
Total borrowings                        8,912
Government contributions                              450
Capitalization of interest on Government advances   2,956
Total sources                          43 884
L LSdl,702,000 has been expended to June 30, 1967, giving a
total of LSdl4,499,000 for the Project, and included
1Sd474,000 being the local currency cost of the powerhouse
substructure.

8.21       The forecasts in this report should be considered as tenta-
tive because the unreliability of financial information for the past
years does not offer a firm basis for forecasting and because CEVC is
presently in a period of reorganization. The requirement that CEWC
should take over small isolated systems for which practically no
operational or financial information is available adds a further
uncertainty. In the forecasts presented, these uncertainties have
been carefully weighed as to their effect on the completion of the
Project and the proper development of CEWC as an autonomous entity, and
and an attempt has been made to provide adequate safeguards for this
purpose. CEWC should adjust these forecasts after the results of each
new fiscal year are available, and has arranged to have them reviewed
by consultants for at least the next two years.
8.22       The takeover from the Government of the Roseires powerhouse
substructure has been included in the accounts of the fiscal year 1967.
8.23       The financing proposed is as follows:
(a)   A Bank loan of US$24 million equivalent (bSd8.362 million)
would be obtained in 1967. For the purposes of the financial
forecasts an interest rate of 6 percent and a term of 25
years, including a grace period of about five years, has
been assumed;
(b)   A foreign exchange loan of LSd880,000 equivalent as debt
to the Government for the financing of the Roseires
powerhouse substructure. Since it forms an integral part
of the Project, terms identical to those of the proposed
Bank loan have been agreed between the Government and CEWC.
(c)   Suppliers' credits of bSd550,000 for various small electri-
fication and water projects for terms of six years at
6 percent interest;
(d)   Local currency cost of the powerhouse substructure of
LSd474,000 as a Government advance without repayment
with interest at 6 percent after completion of the Project.
(e)   The Government has agreed that interest accruing in each
of the fiscal years 1968 through 1970 on Government
advances will be converted to additional interest-carrying
Government advances, unless after a review of the CEIC's
estimated requirements, the Government and the Bank are
satisfied that all or part of such conversion is not
necessary. As a first step, interest accrued for the
period ending December 31, 1967 will be so converted.



- 20 -
8, 24     Since no cash is involved, the cash flow does not show the
takeover from the Government by the CE.JC of Khashm el Girba and other
smaller water and power enterprises. Such assets will have corresponding
Government advances on which no interest would be payable during the
construction period of the Project. This provision would be reviewed in
the light of the tariff study prior to the completbn of the Roseires Power
Project. In the forecasts it has been assumed that CEWC would then be
able to commence interest payments at 6 percent on the outstanding
"interest free" advances estinated at LSd8.7 million.
8.25      Internal cash generation, after meeting debt service and
interest on Government advances, other than that capitalized, would
finance about 72 percent of total capital requirements, the remainder of
28 percent would come from borrowings. No further Government equity
contributions, other than LSd450,000 in 1967/8, are anticipated, but a
guarantee has been received from the Government to provide any funds
necessary to complete the Project.  In accordance with the CEWC Act the
Government would compensate the Corporation for any losses sustained in
the operation of uneconomic systems which it had been asked to take over.
On this basis the proposed financing plan would be acceptable.
Estimated Future Financial Position
8.26      Forecast balance sheets for the fiscal years 1968 through 1973
are shcwn in Annex 9. It is estimated that CEWC's total fixed assets
would increase from I,Sd23.2 million in fiscal year 1967 to iSd65.5 million
by the end of fiscal year 1973, an increase of about 180 percent. Net assets
in operation would be iSd48.4 mi'lion by 1973, 80 percent of which would
be power and 20 percent water assets thus leaving the proportion of fixed
assets for COEC's operations about unchanged from the present.  Work in
progress for power and water installations beyond 1973 is estimated at
LSd3.O million at the end of the forecast period.
8.27      The forecasts assume that in 1968 CEWC would formally incorporate
the Khashm el Girba investment. The questions of the total cost of this
multipurpose project and the specific allocation to power are not yet
clarified and the help of consultants will be enlisted in the valuation.
An amount of LSd4 million has been assumed for the projections. CEWC will
have to take over the small isolated power and water systems (probably
in fiscal year 1967/68) from the Ministry of Wgorks (see paragraphs 2.02
and 2.04), for which negotiations were under way in March of this year.
Again the valuation of these properties is uncertain and should be taken
care of by consultants where applicable. For the forecast a depreciated
total amount of LSd4.3 million has been included.
8.28      CDAWC's debt/equity ratio would change from 4/96 by the end of
fiscal year 1967 to a ratio of 16/84 by June 30, 1973, under the assump-
tion that except for the proposed Bank loan and some other small loans no



- 21 -
other long-term financing would be available. The very low debt capitali-
zation should however not lead to OCBM incurring long-term debt in the
future which would endanger its financial position. A debt limitation
covenant stipulating a 1.5 times coverage of maximum future debt service
from historic earnings at the time of incurrence of newJ debt has been
included in the Loan Documents. Interest payments on Sudan Government
advances which are otherwise treated as equity would be included under debt
service in this computation.
8.29      CEWC's working capital position would remain acceptable provided
the collection problems can be overcome through the strict application of
the 60-day cut-off rule. The forecasts do not assume any recovery from
the present arrears in accounts receivable and any such collection would
further improve CEWC's cash position.
Estimated Future Operating Results
8.30      Forecast income statements of CEIWC for the fiscal years 1967/68
to 1972/73 are shown in Annex 7. The basis for the forecasts are explained
in the notes attached to the annex.  The return on electricity assets
ranges from about 9 to 14 percent; on water assets from about 3 to 4 per-
cent; and overall from 7 to 12 percent.
8.31      Since the return on CEWIC's water operations is low, special
efforts should be made to maintain a minimum level of 4 percent during
the construction period. in addition, studies are being made by con-
sultants for the water supply in the Khartoum area which should help to
increase the productivity of the operations. They should be continued
and expanded in scope and geographic coverage. An understanding has
been reached that CEWC would attempt to improve the return on its water
operations to bring it more into line with its electricity operations,
but would in any case maintain a minimum return of 4 percent on its
water operations.
8.32      The forecast net income from CEWiCts total operations would
provide ample interest coverage of 1.9 to 2.6 times. Internal cash
generation would cover total debt service including interest payments
on Government advances between 2.4 and 3.2 times.
9.  CONCLUSIONS AJD RECO0MNDATIONS
9.01      The proposed Project is required to meet a growing power demand
in CEWC's major system and is economically justified.
9.02      The Project is technically sound, the estimated cost is reason-
able, the construction schedule is realistic and the arrangements for
engineering and supervision of construction and for management consulting
services are satisfactory.



- 22 -
9.03      The Act which established the CEWIC and which governs its
operations is generally acceptable but agreement has been reached that
at an appropriate time it will be amended in certain aspects (paragraphs
3.05, 3.08 and 8.09).
9.04      The Borrower's organization is weak and there is a serious
shortage of experienced staff at all levels. However, CEWC has a
competent General Manager who has taken a number of steps which should
improve the situation, and has in addition employed the services of a
management consulting firm to help establish the Corporation as a viable
autonomous entity. These endeavors will be continued.
9.05      The Borrower's financial position has been poor since tariffs
were reduced by the Government in 1963. CEWC increased tariffs with
effect from August 1, 1967. The resulting financial situation should be
satisfactory.
9.06      The Project would be suitable for a Bank Loan of US$24 million
equivalent for a term of 25 years including a grace period of about five
years. Confirmation has been obtained that:
(i) the Bank will be consulted before any future appointments
to the posts of General Manager (paragraph 3.09), Chief
Electrical Engineer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief
Civil Engineer (paragraph 3.10);
(ii)  CEWC will continue to engage e management consulting firm,
to assist in improving its organization, management, and
staffing, particularly in the financial and commercial
departments, and to review, for at least the next two years,
CEWC!S annual financial forecasts (paragraph 8.21); and
that CEWC will make every effort to recruit experienced
personnel to fill key posts at all levels and that the
present training schemes will be expanded (paragraphs 3.10,
and 8.02);
(iii) the Sudan Government has set up an adequate committee for
coordinating the irrigation and electric power generation
uses of the Roseires waters (paragraph 6.15);
(iv)  CEWCs consolidated accounts will continue to be audited
by independent auditors; and that audits will be completed
within five months after the close of each fiscal year
(paragraph 8.05);



- 23 -
(v) the new tariffs established in August 1967 will not be
reduced during the construction period of the Project
without prior consultation with the Bank, and that a
tariff study prior to completion of the power Project
will be made based on an appropriate return level for the
future, which should however not be less than 8 percent
(paragraph 8.09);
(vi)  CEWC with the help of the consultants will make an
inventory of its present fixed assets and will review
their valuation and also the depreciation policies
(paragraph 8.12);
(vii)   in considering the financing plan, the Sudan Government
has reached agreement with CEVTC regarding the status of
Government advances and interest rates thereon (paragraphs
8.13 and 8.24); the ca.pitalization of interest payable on
its advances during the fiscal period 1968-70 (paragraph
3.23); the settlement of outstanding arrears and future
accounts (paragraph 8.14) and the terms for transferring
the powerhouse substructure to CEC (paragraph 8.22).

NOTES TO ANNEX 1
The folowing are snme comments on the energy sales forecast.
Khartoum Area
In the past five years residential and commercial sales in-
creased at an average rate of 13.2 percent per annum. Daring the next
six years consumption is expected to increase at a higher rate, 16.6
percent per annum, because of CEWC's plan to s          viUages ; onA,tjie
outskirts of Khartoum and because of the Government's large housing
program.
Sales to large industrial consumers during the past five years
have increased at an average rate per annum of 14.3 percent. During the
next six years a lower rate is expected and an increase of about 10.h
percent per annum has been assumed.
About 1,250,000 feddans of land along the Nile is under pumped
irrigation. In the past pumping has been restricted during the low water
season. Since the completion of the Roseires Dam in 1966 the restrictions
have been removed. Originally, nearly all pumping schemes used diesel en-
gines burning expensive imported fuel oil. Many have already been converted
to electric drive and the remainder are expected to be changed over during
the next few yyears. The amount of land under pumped irrigation is also
expected to be substantially increased as the Government's agricultural
consultants estimate over 400,000 feddans are suitable for such develop-
ment. As all new pumping schemes are.likely to have electric drives,
the agriculturalpumping loadis expected to become increasingly impor-
tant to CEWC. During the next six years sales for pumping are expected
to increase at an average rate ofr26,.,9 percent per annum. The increase
during the last five years averaged 55.2 percent per annum.
Blue Nile Area
Sales to residential and commercial consumers have increased
at an average rate of 38.0 percent per annum during the past five years.
During the next six years an average rate of about 25 percent is expected.
Although this rate is high it is not considered unreasonable as the two
towns of Kosti and Singa are soon tz be supplied and CEWC is planning
further electrification in the Gezira area.
Large industrial loads in the area consist mainly of cotton
ginneries and a sugar factory. During the past five years sales in-
creased at an average rate of 18.1 percent per annum. During the next
six years an average annual rate of increase similar to that of the
past few years has been assumed. This is based on the assumption that
the new cement factory at Rabak, which is nearing completion, would take a
large power supply soon and that two flour mills and one oil factory
would be established as proposed.



ANNEX 1
Page 3
A considerable expansion of pumped irrigation in the area
is expected. An additional 1150 hp pump is being installed at the
Guneid pumping station and several other smaller stations are being
expanded. An average rate of increase of about 24.7 percent per annum
has been assumed. Although this rate may seem high it is considered
reasonable in view of the expansion which is taking place. It does
not take into account the requirement of a proposed large pumping
scheme at Suki with an estimated consumption of 53 million kwh per annum.
Northern Area
Diring the past five years sales to residential and commercial
consumers increased at an average rate of 8.8 percent per annum. A higher
rate of increase has been assumed for the next six years. Sales to light
industrial consumers are expected to increase at an average rate of about
9.7 percent per annum and to heavy industrial consumers at an average rate
of 3.5 percent per annum as there is relatively little industrial develop-
ment in the area. Only a small increase in consumption is expected for
pumped irrigation.

ANNEX 5

OPERATION OF ROSEIRES RESERVOIR AND POWER STATION
Reservoir Operation
High water in the Blue Nile usually begins in July and reaches
its peak in August. Luring the early part of the flood season, the
silt content in the river water is at its highest. In order to keep
siltation in the reservoir to a minimum, all the flood water during this
period is passed through sluices in the dam and the reservoir is kept
at a low level. Filling of the reservoir normally starts in September
and by November it is full. After December, when irrigation require-
ments downstream exceed the inflow, the reservoir water level is
gradually drawn down and reaches its lowest level in May. This minimum
level is then maintained until September when the cycle begins again.
Plant Operation
The amount of power which can be generated at Roseires will
depend on the release of water from the reservoir and the reservoir
levels (which determine the head available for the turbines). The
release of water is determined normally by irrigation requirements
downstream and the need to maintain a river flow sufficient to meet
domestic and other requirements.
During the flood season from July to September the available
head is greatly reduced due to a low reservoir level and a rise in the
tailrace water level and the output of the three 30 Mw units will be
between about 44 Mw and 55 Mw. Because of a plentiful flow of water
it should be possible to operate the units at a very high load factor
and during the period the Roseires (and also the Sennar station down-
stream) would therefore supply base load power and thermal plant would
be used to supply peak power.
From October to February, when the reservoir level is high
and water is being released for irrigation, etc., the station output would
be at the maximum and it should be possible to generate sufficient power
to meet the total needs of the Blue Nile system during the period up
to 1973.
During the period March to May when the flow into the reser-
voir is at a minimum and the available head is being reduced because
of a gradual drawdown of the reservoir level the station (and the Sennar
station) would be operated to supply peak power and thus make the best
use of the available water. During this period thermal plant would be
used to supply base load. In June when the river flow begins to increase
the station (and the Sennar station) would revert to base load operations.

Estimated Power Output
Details of the estimated available power and energy outputs
of the Roseires and the existing Sennar stations for the present Stage I
Roseires reservoir development during a year of average rainfall and
during a dry year are shown in the attached table. During an average
year the estimated available energy output of Roseires with a three-
unit installation is 600 million kwh and of Sennar 110 million kwh,
making a total of 710 million kwh. In a dry year the respective
estimated available outputs are 572 million kwh and 101 million kwh
making a total of 673 million kwh.

ANNEX 6
SUDAN
CENTRAL ELECTRICITY AND WATER CORPORATION
Balance Sheets 1964-1967
(in thousands of LSd)
NOTE: The balance sheets shown below present a consolidation of area accounts
(Khartoum, Blue Nile, Northern Area, Eastern Area) and departmental accounts
(electricity generation, transmission and distribution; public lighting; water
purification and distribution; various minor departments); this consolidation
was prepared by the appraisal mission which in addition made adjustments, as
seen required, to present a meaningful picture of CEWC's financial situation.
For 1964 and 1965 the accounts represent the financial situation of CEWA, the
predecessor of CEWC. The 1967 figures are unaudited and have to be considered
as estimates.

NOTES AND REFERENCES TO ANTNEX 7
1.   The forecast of electricity and water sales, average revenuehlnh
and mJ   sold, and of revenues and operating cost covers CEVWC's
present field of operation in the Blue Nile Grid and the Northern
Area (electricity only). For the Eastern Area (Khashm el Giroa)
and the other isolated systems which the Ministry of Works will
transfer to CETC, no adequate data were available.  In order to
consider their possible impact on CEWC's future finances it was
assumed that:
(a) the power operations in the Eastern Area would be
able to cover operating expenditures from revenues;
(b) the electricity enterprises from the Ministry of
Works would cover their total operating costs from
revenues, and
(c)  all new water projects, including the water enterprises
from the Ministry of Works would earn a 5 percent return.
These rather pessimistic assumptions were chosen so as not to
overstate CEWC's resources from operations. On the basis of
the available data it can be expected that the Corporation
should actually do better.
2.   The forecast sales of electricity include those for Khartoum,
the Blue Nile area (WJad Medani and Sennar) and the Northern
Area (Atbara) as shown in Annex 1 and described in Section 4
of this report.
3.   The forecast of water sales was supplied by CEWC and covers the
Khartoum, Wad I4edani and Senmar areasas discussed in Section 5
of the report.
4.   Tariffs used for the forecast for fiscal years 1968 onwards
are the increased new tariffs.
5.   Revenues from electricity sales were forecast by regions and
consumer groups.
6.   Tariff compensation:  see paragraph 8.18
7.   Operating costs for electricity generation were projected on the
basis of a detailed forecast of plant operations in the Blue Nile
Grid and the Northern Area. Provisions for depreciation are
based on the estimated program of capital additions and on
depreciation rates presently applied by CEVTC which are acceptable.
In their fixed assets valuation study (paragraph 8.12) the
consultants will also review the depreciation policies of CEWC.

8.   Assumed net income from water operations in new areas:   see
note l(c) above.
9.   Interest capitalized:  interest payable on foreign exchange loans
for the Project as well as for the powerhouse substructure is
assumed capitalized. In the past, all interest was charged to
operations by the entity.
10.  Net fixed assets in operation are averaged for each year; adjust-
ments are made to reflect the early or late start of operations
during the year for larger items.
11.  The return calculations for the fiscal years 1964 to 1967 exclude
the amounts for tariff compensation (see paragraph 8.18).
12. 1967 Accounts are provisional and subject to audit and revision.

NOTES AND REFERENCES TO ANNEX 8
1.   Depreciation on fixed assets in new areas: the forecast income
statements do not include revenues and operating costs for
CEWC's operations in the Eastern and other isolated areas as
explained in Note 1 to Annex 7. It was therefore necessary to
add back depreciation earned under assumptions (b) and (c) in
order to arrive at the Corporation's total cash generation.
2.   For the foreign exchange loan for the Roseires powerhouse and
the estimated Sudan Government advances of LSd474,000 in fiscal
year 1967 see paragraph 8.23.
3.   For the settlement of Sudan Government arrears in fiscal year
1968, which would cover past years, see paragraph 8.14.
No further amounts for settlements are necessary.
4.   Construction expenditures:   see Section 7 of the report.
5.   Interest on Sudan Government advances:   see paragraphs 8.13,
8.23, 8.24 and 8.25.

MEMORANDUM ON RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
IN THE REPUBLIC OF THE SUDAN
I INTRODUCTION
1.   The previous report on the current economic position and prospects
of the Sudan (AF-49a) was issued on January 30, 1967, and had covered the
situation in the Sudan from the beginning of the Ten-Year Plan period
(1961/62 - 1970/71) to the change in government in July 1966. In May
1967 the Government of Sadik el Mahdi was replaced by one headed by
Mahgoub, a former Prime Minister, and a few days later the hostilities in
the Middle East occurred.
II. SUMMARY OF DEVELOPMENTS
2.   During the first five years of the Ten-Year Development Plan,
1961/62 - 1970/71, 1/ which an earlier (October 1963) Bank report had
called "good, well-worked out, sound and realistic", the growth of GDP
had averaged 4.5 percent. The Plan had set a target of 5.2 percent, with
6.9 percent for the "modern" sector, which uses modern techniques and
equipment; in fact, this sector's growth averaged 5.8 percent.
3.   The total of gross public investment in the four years was LS182
million, or LS35 million higher than planned. This was because some pro-
jects, such as the railways investment program and the construction of
the Roseires dam were carried out more quickly than had been anticipated
in the Plan. The Government also began construction, during the
first four years, of all the factories planned to be built over the whole
ten-year period. Other projects cost more than estimated, particularly
the resettlement of the Wadi Halfans.
4.   But over this same period, the net inflow of foreign capital was
LS17 million below the planned level, and public sector savings available
for fixed investment were also deficient by LSlO million. Contrary
to the original intentions of the planners, there was a substantial ex-
pansion of domestic credit, totalling LS54 million over the four-year
period, and inflationary pressures led to a decline of exchange reserves
from $166.6 million in 1960 to $46 million in June 1966.
5.   During 1965/66 government recurrent expenditures continued to rise
and this was the main reason for the decline in public sector savings.
1/ All financial years through this memorandum begin on July 1st and
end on June 30th.

Moreover, an unsuccessful sales policy for cotton, the Sudan's main
export, caused a worsening both of the budgetary and the balance of
payments positior, and led to an accummulation of large unsold stocks
of cotton in the country.l/
6.   Thus, in July 1966, when Sadik el Mahdi's government took office,
it faced a situation in which the uncommitted reserves of foreign
exchange over the minimum statutory currency cover requirements had
declined to ES15.5 million, and which necessitated strong measures to
deal with the dangers arising from the increasing use of credit from
the central bank to finance overall budgetary deficits.
7.   In August 1966, a new cotton sales policy was announced.   It
included the following measures to reduce the already high level of
stocks:
(a) The minimum reserve prices (i.e. undeclared floor
prices which the Gezira Board observed in accepting
bids at the auctions) were lowered significantly.
It should be added here that until then, the Gezira
Board maintained a selling price higher than the
level determined by conditions of supply and demand.
(b) 50 percent rebate from export duties on cotton was
granted for cotton exported prior to January 1, 1967.
(c) Most of the barter deals (of cotton exports in exchange
for certain imports from particular countries) were
discontinued.
The policy was successful, increasing sales in 1966/67
by over 1S300,000 bales (a 45 percent increase over 1965/66)
to reach 984,000 bales. Exports also increased by 100,000
bales. In addition, there was also an improvement in production
which rose by about 18 percent during that year.
8.   A stand-by credit of $28.5 million was arranged with IMF for one
year on September 22, 1966.
9.   Series of tax increases were announced and the main features of the
new budget were outlined. The government also stated that the Ten-Year
Development Plan no longer fitted the country's situation and that it
would be revised.

10. The followring sections analyse developments in 1965/66 and review recent
developments in the Sudan and particularly since Sadik's government took
office in July 1966 and comments on the future prospects of the economy.
III. OUTPUT AND INVESTMENT
11. The estimated overall growth of GDP in real terms during 1965/66
was 6.25 percent. Investment fell below the level of the previous year,
mainly due to an estimated 30 percent drop in the private sector, which was
possibly a result of the reaction of potential investors to political and
economic uncertainties.
12. The rise in GDP in 1965/66 was largely accounted for by cotton pro-
duction, which, at 860,000 bales, was about 8 percent higher than in the
previous year. Production of cotton in 1966/67 reached 1,016,000 bales;
part of the increase is attributable to an increase in area from
1,050,000 feddans in 1965/66 to 1,130,000 feddans in 1966/67. In addition
there was an increase in productivity (e.g. a rise in the average yield
in the Gezira from 3.6 to 4.2 Kantars per feddan).
13. Output of the food staples, dura and dukhn, fell in 1965/66 while
that of groundnuts and wheat increased. This was a continuation of the
trend in previous years. Wheat and groundnuts are being grown to an
increasing extent in the Gezira as part of the intensification of the
rotation system.
14. 1966/67 has been a bad year for dura production which is pro-
visionally estimated at 914,000 tons compared with 1,09h,000 tons in
1965/66, due to insufficient rainfall in the early part of the growing
season, so much so that exports to neighboring countries were prohibited
at the end of 1966. 50,000 tons of sorghum were bought from the United
States. Output of Dukhn, however, is expected to rise from the previous
year's low level to a more norma)l figure of about 1,356,000 tons in
1966/67. The increased production of groundnuts and wheat continued, as
the area under these crops was expanded. There are no figures available
yet for 1966/67 for production of gum arabic. The feeling is that it
will be lower than the previous year but might be compensated by a rise
in world prices.
15. No recent data were available on the value added in manufacturing
but statistics of the value of total output show a rise of 14 percent



in 1965/66 over the previous year. New industries which have started
production since mid-1965 include the Khasham el Girba sugar factory,
a cement factory with a capacity of 100,000 tons per annum, the Gezira
cooperative's 60,000 ton per annum flour mill, and a glass factory.
The footware and textile industries have both extended their capacity;
the latter is expected to reach 90 million square yards this year.
16. Fixed investment in 1965/66 is provisionally estimated at LS48
million, made up of LS32 million in the public sector, ES13 million in
the private modern sector, and IS3 million in "African style housing".
The public sector investment is some LS5 million less than the previous
year, and reflects the completion of the large projects such as the
Roseires Dam, Guneid Sugar Factory and the resettlement of the Wadi
Halfans. No data are available for investment in 1966/67, but ex-
pectations are that public investment has been at about the same level
as last year or possibly less.
17. In January 1967, widespread moves towards "Sudanization" of the
import and retail trades were announced. "Basic consumption commodities"
were to be "immediately organized through public Sudanese companies".
The commodities involved "include coffee, tea, cigarettes, rice, canvas,
shoes,medicines, flour, common textiles" and "other commodities that may
subsequently be decided". It is understood that foreign companies will
be allowed to continue to trade in fields in which expertise is needed
for servicing equipment and which Sudanese are not yet able to provide.
But these companies are expected to arrange a program which will ensure
total Sudanization within five years. These moves are likely, on
balance, to cause a further diminution in the total of private invest-
ment this year. It is also intended to "Sudanize" the banking system;
banks would become companies in which the majority shareholding would
be Sudanese.

18. The budget for 1966/67 (July 1 - June 30) was delayed until
January 1967 to improve the estimates as realistic forecasts of
necessary expenditures, in an attempt to eliminate the necessity for
subsequent supplementary estimates. The "real" increase in the
1966/67 recurrent expenditure estimates over those of previous years
may therefore be exaggerated.
19. For 1966/67, recurrent expenditure was estimated at g682.7 millionl/
compared with an actual figure of 6S72.8 million in 1965/ . The increase
of 1S9.8 million (i.e. 13 percent) is mainly for defense and security
pruposes, reflecting the continued unsettled situatior in t'ie southern
provinces and also for education and health as a result of a salary
increase granted to government employees in December 1965. For 1967/68
a new stand-by arrangement recently arranged with IMF includes a ceiling
of IS86 million on the government current expenditure.
20. Recurrent revenues reached LS81.7 million in 1966/67, a rise of
about 9 percent above the actual figures for 1965/66. This substantial
increase came from several sources:
(a) an improvement in the administration of tax collection;
(b) a uniform charge of 5 percent on all imports;
(c) an increase in import duties on luxury commodities;
(d) a rise in prices and rates of services of public utilities.
21. At the same time revenue from import duties and export duties and
royalties declined by MS3.7 million in 1966/67 compared in the previous
year. It is noticed here that there was an increase in the rates of
import duties, but it was accompanied by a change in the structure of
imports towards more commodities subject to lowerduty rates (e.g. items
of food).
22. In previous years, extra-budgetary operations such as purchases
for government stores and net additions to stocks of sugar were a drain
on government resources. In 1966/67 the inordinate amount of stocks held
in Government stores was reduced by tightening up the replenishment
procedure, improving the organization of disbursements and offering for
sale items surplus to requirements. The ordinary budget for 1966/67
showed a deficit of around LS1 million compared with actual surpluses of
LS2.4 million and IM10.5 million in 1965/66 and 1964/65 respectively,
thus reducing the contribution of the ordinary budget towards financing
development expenditures.
1/ See Table 5 in the Statistical Appendix



-7-
23. There was a slight improvement in the performance of the public
entities.  The Gezira Board paid the Government LS 0.1 million net in
1966/67 compared with a net subsidy from the Government to the board
of LS o.6 million in 1965/66 and Ls8.6 million in 1964/65.  The public
entities as a whole including the Gezira Board provided a net profit
of LS7.0 million in 1966/67 compared with a loss of 1S7.3 million in
1965/66 and a loss of 1S13.3 in 1964/65.
24. Some items in the ordinary budget may be of a capital nature while
some items in the development budget are of a recurrent nature. Bear-
ing in mind the inadequacies of the figures, the development expenditures
for 1966/67 are estimated at !S28.0 million compared with 1,S30.2 million
(a provisional actualfigure) for 1965/66.
25. The composition of the expenditure in 1966/67, compared with earlier
years, reflects the continuation of the strategy of the plan, i.e. to
develop by irrigation the areas commanded by the new dams at Roseires and
Khashm el Girba, to continue the replacement and expansion of the assets
of the public corporations, notably Sudan Railways and the Central Elec-
tricity and Water Corporation, to continue and to expand educational and
health services and to try to increase the rate of industrial development.
Table 6 in the Statistical Appendix gives the details of the development
expenditures compared with earlier years.
26. The overall budgetary picture of the public sector, including the
government ordinary and development budgetary position and the pro-
vincial and local government and the public entities, shows a deficit of
1S22.9 million in 1966/67 (an improvement over the previous year which
resulted in a higher deficit of LS35.4 million). External sources fin-
anced 1S12.6 million of deficit. Domestic bank credits, restricted by
the 1966/67 IMF stand-by arrangements, covered only LS6.7 million (com-
pared with 1S16.4 million in the previous year). There was also re-
course to short-term credit from foreign commercial banks amounting to
LS3.5 million.
V. BALANCE OF PAYMENTS
27. The difficulties encountered by the Sudan during the last few years
due mainly to an increase in recurrent government expenditures, un-
successful cotton policy and overestimation of foreign capital to finance
development, showed themselves in inflationary pressures internally, and inte-;
alia, in deficits in the balance of payments. These deficits were financed
by drawing upon Sudan's foreign exchange reserves which fell from $166.6 in
1960 to $46 million in June 1966 and reached $41 million in the third quarter
of the year, which is the level of the statutory currency cover requirement.
Even maintaining that level would not have been possible without short-term
borrowing from foreign commercial banks.



28. The improvement of fiscal policy and the cotton sales policy,
with the help of the IMF stand-by agreements for 1966/67-1967/68
has prevented the balance of payments from a more serious further deterior-
ation which would have been the outcome otherwise. Provisional figures
for 1966/67 show an overall deficit of IS7.6 million (compared with
deficits of LS6.7 million in 1965/66 and IS8.7 million in 1964/65).
29.  The increase in cotton exports from LS26.9 in 1964/65 to MS32.5
million in 1965/66 and LS34.2 million in 1966/67 particularly helped in
reducing the trade deficit from 1S23.8 million in 1963/64 to ES9.2
million in 1964/65, LS6.5 million in 1965/66'and LS6.3 million in 1966/67.
30. There was also an improvement in the net payments for services
(from LS12.5 million to 1S8.8 million). However, net capital movements
deteriorated and continued the decline in the inflow of private capital
in previous years from LS3.9 million in 1963/64 to LS 0.6 million in
1965/66 and was only ES 0.2 million in 1966/67. Official public capital
inflow also declined from IS14.1 million in 1965/66 to 1S7.8 million in
1966/67.
VI. EFFECTS OF THE ARAB/ISRAELI CONFLICT
AND THE CLOSURE OF THE SUEZ CANAL
31. The closure of the Suez Canal, through which cbout 85 percent of
Sudan's imports and 65 percent of its exports are shipped, meant a
delay in shipment, higher transport costs and a loss of revenue from
customs duties. In July these receipts were LS2 million less than
normal, and the shortfall in July-September may total LS6-8 million.
This may mean that government expenditure over the next few months will
have to be financed by bank credit, but presumably this will be a tem-
porary phenomenon. However, cotton sales have been going well and prices
have been rising. Stocks with exporters totalled 284,000 bales by the
end of June 1967.
32. The breaking of diplomatic relations with the United States has led
to the withholding of LS2-3 million in aid, and 250,000 tons sorghum under
Food for Peace in 1967/68. Aid from the U.K. was about to be increased
to a level of iS1 million a year and is largely in suspense.
33. The Sudan appears to be more determined in its attempts to reduce
its adverse balance of trade with the U.K., traditionally the largest
supplier of imports (23 percent in 1965) and third largest customer
(8.5 percent in 1965). In the short run at least, this would cause
difficulties and expense because the spare parts and servicing capa-
bilities are based on equipment from traditional suppliers.



- 9 -
34.   The Government and senior officials have since the middle of June
been heavily engaged in various meetings and conferences abroad, in
connection with the Middle East crisis. An Arab Foreign Ministers'
conference was held in Khartoum at the end of July, another at the
end of August, followed by a meeting of Heads of State.
35. The present Government is a grouping of the conservative wing
of the Umma Party and the National Union Party (NUP), together with the
People's Democratic Party (PDP), and some southern support. The cur-
rent Middle East situation is being used to foster an atmosphere calling
for national unity behind the present coalition government, but the
situation in the south remains disturbed.
36.   A stand-by arrangement for $10 million was reached with IMF for
1967/68. Accordingly, ceilings on credit have been established, in-
cluding a limit of LS4 million on expansion of credit to the Government,
and an overall figure for public expenditure at LS86 million for 1967/68
is to be maintained. The provisions of the stand-by arrangement will
help to relieve the Sudan from the short run difficulties. If the closure
of the Suez Canal continues for a longer period, Sudan's development will
be impeded but not prohibited, by higher transport costs on its overseas
trade.
VII. MEDIUM AND LONG TERM PROSPECTS
Output and Investment
37. The outlook for output in the medium term is generally favorable,
apart from the increasingly debilitating effect on the economy of the
trouble in the southern provinces.
38. These provinces have the potential to develop production, inter alia,
to meet the Sudanese requirements of tea, coffee and sugar, which are at
present imported. Tobacco could also be produced. The feasibility of
such schemes is unfortunately an academic question at the moment though
the waste of resources which the present situation involves is not.
39. Further expansion of irrigated farming will result from use of the
waters of the Roseires and Khashm el Girba dams. Cotton is likely to
continue as the main crop. A shift from extra long staple to upland
cotton has been considered. Medium staple cotton has better market
prospects than extra long staple, and certain goduction advantages;
shorter growing season, need for less water, and greater ease of harvest-
ing even by hand. As a result it is being introduced into Khashm el
Girba and is planned for the Rahad project. In the Gezira, however, it



- 10 -
seems probable that better returns would accrue to intensified efforts
to improve yields and to lower costs of production of the extra long
staple varieties than to a shift to what would be new varieties for the
Gezira farmer.
40.   Increased production of wheat and groundnuts is likely to continue.
This is both a way of increasing the intensity of cropping in schemes
such as the Gezira, and of increasing the number of families producing
cash crops by modern methods in rainfed areas.
Public Finance
41.   The Sudan's difficulties, explained in earlier paragraphs, were partly
controlled by an improvement in fiscal measures, and cotton policy and by
reducing excessive government stocks.
42.   However further improvements are needed in the arrangements between
the tennant farmers in the Gezira Board and the government. It is greatly
to be hoped that it will be politically possible to continue the trend of
reducing the government subsidies to the Board which were LS8.6 million
in 1964/65, LS0.6 million in 1965/66 and only 1S0.1 million in 1966/67
so that the revenue from The Board may provide a contribution to public
savings.
43.   Apart from higher direct revenues from Gezira, greater public savings
in the Sudan will be facilitated by higher export receipts. These will
increase the yield of export duties, and at the same time increase incomes
and the demand for goods. This in turn will raise the revenues from import
duties and production and consumption taxes. The exports will also, of
course, provide the foreign exchange to pay for the imports.
Exports and Capital Inflow
44. Cotton is the key, since it provides about 50 percent of total export
earnings and probably about 15 percent of domestic incomes. Most of Sudan's
cotton grown on irrigated land is extra long staple (ELS). The market
prospects in the medium and long term for ELS cotton are dominated by
three adverse factors. Firstly, synthetic fibers are increasing their
competition in the clothing industry; secondly in the manufacture of blended
yarns and fabrics there is growing competition from longer staple upland
(rainfed) cotton, especially the Acala varieties. And thirdly, U.S. cotton
policy is likely in future to depress world cotton prices generally. Whether
these adverse factors will outweigh those which make for higher demand for
ELS cotton, such as increasing purchases by the USSR, Eastern Europe and
China, is uncertain. What is less doubtful is that the increased competition
from synthetics and longer staple upland cotton will continue to reduce the
premium paid for ELS cotton over short and medium staple cotton. It is for
these reasons that the production of Acala cotton is being encouraged, both
in rainfed areas such as the Nuba Mountains, and the Gedaref and in new
irrigated schemes at Khashm el Girba and the Rahad area.



45. As well as the market prospects for cotton in general and ELS in
particular, Sudan has the problem of selling her crop against the
competition of other producers such as the UoA.R. As part of her successful
change of policy in this respect during 1966, half of the export levy was
sacrificed. At first this was a temporary measure designed to clear
the abnormally high stocks of cotton which had accumulated in the country.
But the recent reduction of 25 percent in the level of duty for..
the next season suggests that it may be difficult to combine an aggressive
and successful sales policy for cotton, which is necessary to improve and
preserve Sudan's balance of payments position, with higher rates of export
duty on cotton.
46. Earnings from the export of groundnuts and products (oil and cake)
could double between 1965/66 and 1970/71, despite an expected decline in
export prices of 22 percent. Other exports - sesame, gum arabic and
dura - mainly grown in the traditional sector, and cattle, hides and skins
are expected to grow at a moderate rate. In total, exports are expected
to realize £S96 million in 1970/71 compared with £S73 million in 1965/66.
47. Earlier Bank reports drew attention to the shortcomings in development
administration in the Sudan. These still exist and are now even more
urgently in need of repair. A member of the Bank's staff recently visited
Khartoum to study this problem, and is in the course of making recommenda-
tions to the Government. Shortage of experienced and qualified staff is
the main difficulty, and until it is remedied it will be unrealistic to
expect any real progress in the preparation of a new plan.
48. The outlook for the inflow of foreign private capital is bound to be
affected by the policy referred to in paragraph 20 of restricting certain
areas of commerce to Sudanese nationals. Until the operation of the policy
is more clearly defined in practice, it may be that it will result in a net
fall in the supply of foreign private capital
Creditworthiness
49.   The Sudan's existing external debt is not high and shows no concen-
tration of repayments in the medium-term. For example, if in addition to
foreign loans already incurred, the gross inflow of new funds over the next
four years (1967/68 to 1970/71) averaged 60% more than the total inflow of
the previous four years, the debt servicing burden would not rise to ex-
cessive levels. In 1966, the total service payments on public debt are
estimated to have been LS5.5 million, or 6.9% of the estimated average ex-
port earnings.l/ If, over the next four years, ES102 million of additional
loans 2/ were obtained, the total interest and amortization payments would
rise to about £S11.2 million in 1970/71. This would be equivalent to 11
percent of estimated export earnings of £S103 million.
1/ £881 million - estimated three year average centered on 1966/67.
2/ On terms assumed on average as 20 years maturity, including two years
of grace and at 6% interest.



- 12 -
50.   A full analysis of Sudan's creditworthiness is still not possible
because the difficulties following the recent Middle East hostilities and
the closure of the Suez Canal have naturally limited the consideration which
the new government has been able to devote to longer term policies. More-
over, as indicated above, staff shortages have affected the preparation
of a new development plan. However, economic performance in the last year
has not been discouraging so that this memorandum can still maintain the
conclusions reached in the previous report that the Sudan is regarded as
creditworthy for a limited amount of borrowing at conventional terms.

1/ Beginning in 1965/66 the accounts of the Sudan Airways were excluded from the
Government budget; in 1964/65 the Sudan Airways' revenue amounted to about LSd 3
million. This amount has been excluded from the "fees and changes" category,
where it had been shown in previous years.
2/ In the period September 1966 to February 1967 a cotton export duty rebate was
granted. For most shipments it amounted to LSd 0.5 per kantar or LSd 3.1 per bale.
507 bales were exported in this period; the refunded amount of LSd 1.1 million has
been deducted from the yield of export duties and royalties as recorded in the
budgetary accounts.
3/ This figure differs slightly from the budgetary accounts owing to the latter
being recorded on an accrual basis.
Note: Due to rounding components do not always add up to totals.
