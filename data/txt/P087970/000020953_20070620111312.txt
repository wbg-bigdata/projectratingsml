PART I: Environmental and Social Impact Assessment 
 
1. Introduction 
 
1.1 
Scope of the assignment 
 
On an area of about 107,000 ha (equivalent to 255,000 feddans), located approximately 60 
kilometers north of Cairo to the west of the Nile Delta, noticeable agricultural growth through 
exploitation of groundwater has been realized over the past 25 years. Today, this area is a 
flourishing agricultural economy estimated between $300 to $500 million dollars annually, serving 
both domestic and export markets in the European Union and elsewhere. Moreover, the area now 
provides about 150,000 jobs in the agriculture sector. However, with the rapid development there 
has been an excessive depletion of the groundwater reserves. With about 47% of the total 100,000 
ha. under cultivation, water extraction by the year 2002 reached 1080 million m
3
annually, or an 
increase of 36.2% in just over a decade. Groundwater is quickly depleting with a commensurate 
effect on overall water quality.  
 
To improve the situation, GoE has identified the West Delta Water Conservation and 
Irrigation Rehabilitation Project (WDWCIRP). The gross project area covers 80,000 ha. out of the 
107,000 ha.. The project area will be supplied with surface water through an extensive pipeline 
system. The surface water will be diverted from the Nile system, i.e. the Rayah el Nasseri. 
 
This Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) including an Environmental and 
Social Management Plan (ESMP), has been prepared for the WDWCIRP to contribute to the design 
and appraisal of the WDWCIRP by the Government of Egypt (GoE) Ministry of Water Resources 
and Irrigation (MWRI) and the World Bank. The ESIA is a follow-up to the DRAINFRAME 
assessment of the project's conceptual design 
(PPIAF 2005)
 which was carried out in 2005 as a first 
scoping of the impacts of the WDWCIRP and testing of some main project conceptual alternatives. 
This study (Part I) provides an update and further specification of the findings of the 
DRAINFRAME assessment according to the latest status of the technical design of WDWCIRP and 
includes a verification of the World Bank's safeguards policies that came out of a screening process. 
The negative impacts of the project are assessed and avoiding or mitigating measures are identified. 
 
Part II of this report contains the Environmental and Social Management Plan for 
implementation of the identified mitigation measures. In a logical sequence the plan describes the 
activities, the responsible and executive agencies, the required capacity building, monitoring, and 
the costs that would be incurred to implement the mitigation measures. 
 
This report will be disclosed according to the requirements of the World Bank for category A 
projects. The final draft will be enclosed in the tender documents.

Setting of the WDWCIRP project 
2.1 
The West Delta Region 
 
The extended West Delta Region (WDR) lies west of the Rosetta Branch of the Nile. The 
area is covered by sedimentary rocks belonging to the Quaternary and Late Tertiary
.
The main 
aquifer systems are the Alluvium and the Moghra. The 
Alluvium
 covers a large portion of the area 
in the north and north-eastern sides. It consists of Pleistocene sand and gravel, changing to fine sand 
and clay in the north. The 
Moghra
 aquifer system is the main aquifer in the south and western 
portions of the area. It consists of Lower Miocene sands with clay intercalations, underlain by 
Oligocene basalt or shale, (Fig. 2.1). 
 
Fig. 2.1:
 Geological Map of WDR  
Fig. 2.2:
 Soil Associations of WDR 
(MIMR 1981)
 
(Hammad M.A. 1975)
 
This area more or less coincides with the soils of the active delta and the soil units 5, 6, 12, 
18, 24, and 25 as indicated on the Soil Associations Map of Egypt. (Figure 2.2).  
 
The land formed in the Holocene is called the "old lands". It includes all lands that are used 
for agriculture and fisheries since ancient times. The other part of the WDR is being converted 
gradually into agricultural land since High Aswan Dam in 1966, a process that is still going on. 
These reclaimed desert lands are called "old new land" and "new new land" respectively, depending 
on the period in which they where developed. 
 
To the west, the West Delta Region borders the Matruh Governorate, which extents up to the 
Libyan border. Figure 2.3 shows a schematic lay-out of the WDR with the main landscape units. 
The project area is considered as new new land. 
 
The West Delta Region falls in 4 different governorates (Figure 2.4), assuming that the 
eastern border of the Governorate of Matruh is the boundary of the West Delta Region. In the north 
Alexandria covers parts of the Old new lands and the Nubariya Command area. The central part of 
the new lands and the old lands of WDR come under Beheira governorate. Saddat City and the 
north-east part of the groundwater based area belong to Menufia. The southern most part of the 
WDR belongs to Gizeh governorate. There is no relation between administrative and hydraulic 
boundaries of irrigation areas. The project concession area falls in Menufia, Beheira and Gizeh.

2.2 
Development history of the WDR 
 
More than 98 percent of the population of Egypt (currently 77 millions)  lives in the old 
lands of Egypt which imposes heavy social and economic pressure on the living conditions with 
potentially adverse environmental impacts on the resources of the country. To alleviate the pressure 
on the old lands a policy of expanding the irrigated areas to the maximum allowed by the available 
resources, has been adopted by the government of Egypt since the mid of the twentieth century. The 
WDWCIRP project fits in this policy. Another national policy, desc
ribed in “Egypt and the 21st 
century” 
(Cabinet ARE, 1997)
,
is to encourage people living in the over-crowded mega cities and Nile 
Page  10
10
delta to settle in new lands and cities. The national objective is to increase the inhabited space of 
Egypt on the long term from 5% to 25% so as to slow down the rate of urbanization of the old lands.  
 
In 1966, the High Aswan Dam was completed and the Nile Valley and Delta were no longer 
subject to the annual floods of the Nile. Since HAD, Egypt has consistently followed a policy to 
manage its water resources to the maximum. The huge storage of water in the newly formed Lake 
Nasser allowed for intensification of agriculture in the Old Lands from one crop a year to at least 2 
crops. This is the so-called "Vertical Expansion Program". There was also enough water for 
expansion of the irrigated area outside the Old Lands. This program is called the "Horizontal 
Expansion Program". The total area under the Horizontal Expansion Program encompasses 1.4 
million ha. of New Land. Part of this area is planned to be developed with deep groundwater. About 
1.1 million ha will be developed with water from the Nile of which about 0.5 million ha. were 
completed in 2004 
(NWRP 2004)
.
The new irrigation schemes are also built in order to compensate for the loss of agricultural 
land to urbanization in the Delta, which currently is about 0.8% per year and to provide 
opportunities to generate new jobs, increase production and widen the development base. 
 
The WDR is characterized by its proximity to the largest urban areas and well connected to 
the export ports in Cairo and Alexandria. Since the 1960s public investments were provided to 
supply Nile water through the Nubariya Canal to irrigate the northern part of the West Delta Region 
using modern irrigation systems. 
 
The first horizontal expansion came with the reclamation of the so-called "Old new land". 
This is a stretch of reclaimed land on the fringes of the active delta, occupied mainly by small 
holders. Later the Nubariya and Bustan areas were reclaimed, using surface irrigation techniques. 
These are called the new land. The total area of Nubariya and Bustan is about 215,000 ha. 
 
Since the late 1970’s the government encourages the private sector to invest in irrigated 
agriculture using groundwater in the higher southern part of WDR. This groundwater based irrigated 
agriculture has rapidly developed during the past 25 years by commercial farms using modern 
localized irrigation technology to cultivate high value cash crops. Today this area has a flourishing 
agricultural economy with an estimated worth between $ 300 million to $ 500 million per year, 
serving both domestic and export markets in the European Union and elsewhere. Moreover, the area 
increasingly provides job opportunities and has become a home for over half million inhabitants.  
 
In the same period the policy of increasing the inhabited space has resulted in the 
establishment of new cities in the WDR, notably Sadat City (50,000 inh.), Natrun City and  
Nubariya City. In Sadat City quite a number of industrial companies have settled as well. Therefore, 
next to ground water for the agricultural sector, there is also a growing demand for high quality 
domestic and industrial water in and around the project area. 
2.2.1  Development of main environmental issues in WDR
The conversion of the Northern parts of the desert fringes during the 1960s into new land 
using traditional surface irrigation technology (basin, strip and furrow irrigation) rather soon 
resulted in water logging and salinization problems, in the adjacent old lands of Northern-West of 
the Nile Delta. This was also due to the lack of an adequate drainage system in the old lands by that 
time. Later, to solve these problems, it became illegal to use surface irrigation technology in new 
desert reclaimed land. Meanwhile, an extensive drainage system has been constructed. The drainage 
improvement process is part of the post High Aswan Dam national scale drainage projects to 
conserve the productivity of the irrigated lands against salinisation and waterlogging. Part of the 
drainage water in WDR is disposed in the Rosetta Branch, part is flowing back directly in the 
Page  11
11
Nubariya Canal, part is collected by the Umum Drain and either re-used or disposed in the 
Mediterranean Sea near Alexandria.  
 
The rapid development of groundwater based agriculture, south of the Bustan area, mainly 
the proposed PPP project area, resulted in excessive depletion of the groundwater and the water 
table is falling in some places at a rate of about one meter per year. This is associated with 
increasing salinity of the pumped groundwater. Irrigators are currently confronted not only with 
increasing cost of pumping but also yield reduction due to high irrigation water salinity. 
 
The new cities and industries as well as agriculture and agri-business in the WDR are 
expected to produce increasing amounts of solid waste and waste water. In many places in WDR the 
technology and services to sustainably deal with these flows of waste are not yet fully developed. 
This inevitably poses a threat to the quality of both surface water in the North as well as 
groundwater in the South of WDR. Solid waste which is not processed properly, in due course will 
pose problems for public health. In the PPP project area, farmers exceptionally recycle the 
agricultural solid waste into mulch and organic fertilizer material and some use the waste to generate 
bio-gas. 
2.2.2  Development of main social issues
Almost the entire Egyptian population lives on just 4 percent of the country's land, mostly in 
the fertile areas of the Nile valley and delta. Egypt's national policy is to provide suitable living 
conditions outside these overcrowded old lands so that people are stimulated to move to the new 
lands. 
 
Egyptians have a dualistic perception of their country, when they cont
rast “el wadi” or 
“Valley” with “el gabal”, literally the “mountain” - a wilderness, which in the Egyptian context 
refers to the desert. As in the past, Egypt’s contemporary economy, society, and the culture are 
overwhelmingly based in el wadi. The vast majority of its rapidly growing population resides in 
packed villages, towns and cities. These communities are all crowded in the narrow confines of the 
wadi.  
 
By contrast, in 1986 only 564,056 people (1.2 percent of Egypt’s total population) lived in 
the vast territories of what is categorized as the “frontier governorates” of Matruh, Wadi El Gedid, 
the Red Sea, North Sinai, and South Sinai (CAPMAS, 1991:10-11). Nonetheless, in recent decades 
the boundaries between the desert and the old agricultural lands of the wadi have become blurred as 
some of the “red lands” (now referred to as the new lands or reclaimed lands) have been converted 
to agricultural production. Thus an increasing number of Egyptians from the wadi now see the 
desert as a new frontier, a new place to invest, to work and to live. 
 
Peasant smallholders (those owning less than 2 ha.) comprise 94 percent of all Egyptian 
landowners. In general, holdings of less than 2 ha are too small for profitable agriculture to farmers 
with growing families. Consequently, smallholders have to supplement their income by working on 
the land of larger owners, or by finding seasonal work. Many smallholders have rented their plots 
for part or all of the year to other peasants, especially to those who owned between 2 and 4 ha. 
 
Many of these smallholders in Menoufia, Beheira and Nubariya districts earn additional 
income by permanently or seasonally working on large farms in the West Delta. The present number 
of permanent jobs directly related to agriculture in the project area is calculated at approximately 
12,500; the number of temporary jobs at approximately 70,000. Most of these laborers commute 
between the farms and their home towns, as opportunities for settlement in the project area are 
absent and conditions in the neighboring towns are difficult. There are four main communities 
around the project area: Sadat City, Wadi El Natrun, Adnan Medani village, and Khatatba city.
 
Workers living in Sadat city, Wadi El Natrun and Adnan city were asked to evaluate 13 basic 
Page  12

services in their desert communities. Those who had lived in the community for ten years were 
asked whether, in their opinion, the various services had improved, stayed the same or had 
deteriorated over the past ten years. Those who had spent less than ten years were asked to compare 
the services with those in their previous communities by indicating whether the services in their new 
community were better, the same or worse.

The services that appear to have received the greatest attention by the government is the 
infrastructure group especially electricity and telecommunication. Except for Sadat city, sewerage is 
not available, which may result in a groundwater pollution risk. Though improvements in the basic 
needs and social services groups have been noted in Sadat City, they are also perceived to have 
deteriorated and sometimes unavailable (such as drinking water) in the small Adnan city. Cultural 
and religious services show mixed results with large unavailability of sports and entertainment (only 
one social club in Sadat city). In fact services identified as most needing improvements by first 
choice of workers indicated health followed by education. 
 
Experience from the communities discussed above may be of longer-term relevance for the 
WDWCIRP with regard to induced development in general and the nature of the work force in 
particular. Experience from Sadat City clearly illustrates that people will prefer to commute if basic 
social services are lacking. Conversely, the presence of basic services (schools, food markets, 
hospitals, water & sanitation etc) will attract permanent settlements. In view of the above, it is 
expected that most of the additional jobs created in the new lands will be filled by commuters. As 
indicated in the Social Impact Assessment Study (Annex VI), this has a number of implications for 
regional development and longer-term sustainability which should be monitored.  A baseline study 
should be prepared and a monitoring program developed as discussed in Section 3 of the ESMP. 
This could also play a critical role in informing the future planning process with regard to further 
development in the new lands.

2.2.3 Autonomous development 
For investors in high-tech agriculture in the project area, the autonomous development 
scenario, i.e. without availability of surface water, is threatening to their lifetime investments. Some 
foresee a short period of 5-7 years before groundwater is not accessible anymore. Other investors 
whose farms are located in relatively low terrain near the border with the old lands, say they won't 
feel threatened before 10 years time. Some farmers have been rationally using their groundwater 
wells. As one investor put it "
I
never operated my wells more than 10 hours a day in order to 
control the water salinity
."
Obviously this is linked with the location and size of the farm and 
intensity of agriculture (irrigated area) in the farm. 
 
Not only will the gradual depletion of groundwater resources affect agricultural development 
but also the related agro-businesses in the entire region that have started to flourish such as the food 
processing. In its turn this will cause a severe decline in the job market.  
 
In addition, the level of agricultural exports in the whole country will fall down significantly.  
According to one investor "
the West Delta is exporting 60% of the country's grapes, potatoes and 
strawberries to Europe.
"
He further adds "
if no surface water is made available to the West Delta, 
investors will close their farms in a matter of 10 years if water in the aquifer steadily decreases. 
However, if the water unexpectedly falls rapidly in the aquifer, these farms could very well close 
down in a matter of 3 to 4 years.
"
This scenario then will have a negative impact on job opportunities and settlement in the area 
in the very near future.  The whole area of the West Delta could very well fall into a state of 
irreversible deterioration.  However, the scenario of providing no surface water has to be put in the 
context of overall development of Egypt. In other words, the surrounding areas of the West Delta 
such as Menoufia, Beheira, Giza and other governorates will witness inflow of returning settlers, 
and the loss of temporary and permanent jobs of commuting laborers. The nearby governorates of 
Menoufia and Beheira are depending to a great extent on the West Delta for providing jobs  as well 
as for their food security.   
 
The Nubariya graduate villages, although dependent on surface irrigation and having their 
own canals, have grown to be dependent on the West Delta farms for finding job opportunities. 
These graduate villages, which started off as homes for graduates only, have grown into villages that 
export workers to the large farms nearby. The Nubariya villages as one investor puts it, have 
improved a lot in terms of social 
cohesion and services as well. “
When Al Shagaa village was built 
by the government in 1986, each graduate was given a house of 2 rooms and five feddans. Now we 
have 300 new houses that are homes for inflowing workers from different governorates who are 
working as skilled and semi skilled workers in nearby farms and businesses
."

Present proposal of WDWCIRP 
3.1 
Project rationale: problems and opportunities 
 
Since the late 1970-ties, approximately 1,000 land holders 
(
PPIAF Study, 2005)
 have developed 
successful commercial farming based on groundwater irrigation on the desert fringes to the West of 
the Nile Delta along the Cairo-Alexandria Highway, between Km 45 and 80. However, these 
developments have come at the cost of rapid aquifer depletion and increased groundwater salinity, 
making water quality and availability the main constraints to sustained agricultural activity in the 
area. 
 
With the rapid development over the past few years, there has been an excessive exploitation 
of the groundwater reserves. With about 47% of the total 100,000 ha under cultivation, water 
extraction by the year 2002 reached 1,080 million m3 annually, a 36% increase in just a decade. Due 
to excessive extraction, reserves have been depleted locally and with increasing pumping heads, 
water quality is also deteriorating. In some places groundwater levels have dropped significantly 
since the early 1990s and unless the situation is reversed, the water table is expected to drop further 
at an average annual rate of 1-2 meters/year in some parts of the project area (Box 3.1).  
Box 3.1: Groundwater in the West Delta Region 
·
Groundwater flow takes various directions: 
1) The general flow direction is south-east to north-west; 
2) The main anomaly is that occurring along the Nubariya canal due to seepage from the canal; 
3) Other anomalies prevail around the pumping centers; 
4) The changes in the depth to groundwater are a result of overexploitation in the development centers. 
·
The main source of recharge is seepage from surface water canals and excess irrigation in the surface-water 
fed areas; while discharge takes place either naturally through evaporation (Wadi El Natrun depression), or 
artificially through pumping.  
·
The annual rate of pumping in the entire WDR is about 1,080 cubic meters per year (2002). 
·
The groundwater salinity (TDS) ranges from 500 ppm (CaHCO
3
–
MgCO
3
types), in the east, to more than 
4,000 ppm in the west (NaCl type). 
·
This indicates that the main source of salt in the east is the leaching with Nile water; while in the west, the 
source is from marine deposits. 
This puts the agricultural economy worth $ 300 to $500 million per year, at severe risk, loss 
of jobs for about 150,000 persons, and salinity build up in the underlying groundwater aquifer. 
 
There are three main opportunities to solve these problems:  
-
The Government of Egypt is willing to consider the area as part of the horizontal expansion 
program. This makes it possible on policy grounds to make Nile water available for the 
project. 
-
The World Bank shows interest in supporting the project through making available to the 
government a loan of $145 million which will be made available to a private operator as a 
line of credit to design, construct and operate the system. The AFD and the Government of 
the Netherlands will contribute a loan of $30 million and grant of $6 million, respectively. 
The private operator will make available the rest of the capital needed through equity.  
-
The willingness among the landholders is high to connect to a surface irrigation system to be 
implemented by a the private sector according to a public-private partnership and on the basis of full 
cost recovery of the investment and recurrent costs. 
3.2 
Project preparation process 
PPIAF study
Page  15
15
The project preparation process for WDWCIRP started in 2004 with a study called 
"Conceptual Framework and Transaction Model for a Public-Private Partnership for Irrigation in the 
West Delta, Egypt" 
(PPIAF 2005).
 The study was assigned by PPIAF and was submitted to GoE, 
MWRI in 2005. Shortly the study is called PPIAF study. Apart from a Main Report, the study 
presents annexes on: 
1. 
Stakeholders Consultations and Survey Report; 
2. 
Groundwater Survey Report; 
3. 
Technical Options Report; 
4. Financial 
Aspects; 
5. 
Assessment of Institutional Options for Public Private Partnership; 
6. 
Draft Willingness to Connect Agreement. 
The PPIAF study was conducted with some presuppositions: 
-
GoE wishes to minimize if not fully stop the depletion of groundwater; 
-
GoE intends to practice full cost recovery; 
-
GoE wants practical examples to involve the private sector in the design, construction, 
operation and even financing of irrigation water delivery. 
 
The Technical Options Report of the PPIAF study analyzed a number of alternative lay-outs 
and broad system designs, and made preliminary cost calculations. The Groundwater Report 
analyzed the behavior of the groundwater in the area with and without the project. 
 
This study started with a gross study area of 122,000 ha., which later on was sized down to 
107,000 ha. (Fig. 3.1). The high southern and western most areas were excluded as potential project 
areas. A total of 1.6 BCM of Nile water would be made available annually for WDWCIRP.

study 2005) 
 
It is important to 
underscore that 
the PPIAF study was principally a conceptual level study, and primarily designed to develop a 
framework for a PPP transaction model for a possible project. 
 
The technical work wasn't construed to complete the full list of tasks that would be performed in a 
full feasibility assessment of the project. For that, additional preparatory work was found essential, 
notably:    
-
In later phases, the layout and designs will be modified according to the actual willingness to 
connect. 
-
A
staging plan or phasing of the entire project is required.

The required environmental and safeguard assessments have to be carried out. 
 
DRAINFRAME assessment
By the time the PPIAF study was ready in 2005, a DRAINFRAME
1
assessment was made of 
the intended WDWCIRP 
(Drainframe 2005)
.
The main objective of this DRAINFRAME study was to 
generate an adequate understanding of all impacts that will arise from the construction and operation 
of a surface water system in the west desert fringes currently irrigated with groundwater. This 
assessment would contribute to further project preparation and design. Following the conceptual 
design, the DRAINFRAME analysis was another step in the entire project preparation cycle. They 
will be followed by more detailed design studies, an environmental impact assessment, and 
environmental management plans. 
 
The DRAINFRAME study is conceived as the scoping phase of the current environmental 
and social impact assessment. Its main findings were meant to serve as an input in the ongoing 
design process of WDWCIRP and served as a starting point for this ESIA. The study took a broad 
view on the potential development in the West Delta Region and the assessment of potential impacts 
was done with a broad scope. Therefore the DRAINFRAME study allowed for a rational narrowing 
down of the assessment of impacts of the currently propose project. The DRAINFRAME 
assessment formulated and tested  three alternative strategies for the conjunctive use of ground 
water and surface water: (i) the "business as usual" strategy with continuing 100% use of ground 
water, (ii) a conjunctive use strategy (ground water use up to sustainability level) and (iii) a strategy 
without any ground water use. The impact parameters were: economic output, job opportunities, and 
ground water changes.  The main findings of the assessment were that three major drivers of change
are responsible for the expected positive and negative impacts of the project on-side and off-side the 
project area:
 
1) 
The withdrawal of Nile water and its potential impact of it on the old land; 
2) 
The supply of surface water and the residual groundwater use and recharge;  
3) 
Regional development induced by the project.  
 
Hence the study identified the following questions for the design process, so as to deal with 
the possible negative impacts:  
1) 
What can be done to avoid
negative impacts?  
2) 
If complete avoidance is impossible, how can residual negative impacts be mitigate
d?  
3) 
If mitigation is not fully effective, how can negative impacts be compensate
d
for? 
 
In an addendum to the DRAINFRAME assessment, the possible impacts of the WDWCIRP 
project were assessed under the assumption that only 0.4 BCM/y of Nile water would be withdrawn 
for a first phase project, instead of 1.4 BCM/y as was the earlier assumed. 
 
The conclusion was that scaling down the project area and the delivered surface water from 
1.4 to 0.4 BCM/year would be without immediate negative effects on  water allocation . But it 
would by no means solve the problems in the long term in the wider area without addressing the 
new demands within the context of National Water Resources Plan (NWRP). Secondly, reducing the 
amount of water to be taken from the Nile for desert irrigation would reduce the potential negative 
impacts on the Old Lands and create time to implement the necessary mitigating (= water saving) 
1
Drainframe is a water resources planning tool that ensures the integration of the multiple functions of the natural 
resources systems and interests of all stakeholders into the planning process and in addressing all the concerns related to 
a
project. It
 
provides a methodology which expands the concept of strategic environmental assessment (SEA) to the 
assessment of the main economic, social and environmental impacts of new structural or management interventions on 
the natural resource systems and its consequences for stakeholders. Central to the methodology is the integrated analysis 
of societies’ economic an social needs while safeguarding the ecological values, from a stakeholders perspective at the 
regional level
.

measures specified in the NWRP. This, among other reasons, has resulted in the present, modest 
project size. 
Project Appraisal Document
Successive draft Project Appraisal Document (PAD) is prepared on basis of the above 
mentioned preparatory studies. This growing document further narrows the room of maneuver for 
the WDWCIRP's ultimate design and defines the broad project components. It also indicates what 
need to be done to counteract the environmental and social impacts and how to respond to the 
relevant safeguards policies of the World Bank. 
 
Important to notice is that the draft PAD states: 
"Final technical design under this project will be entrusted to a private operator selected through 
international competitive bidding. Under the terms of the contract, the private operator will 
complete the final design of the project based on a final subscription of farmers’ willingness to 
connect".   
Technical Study
The stakeholder consultations and the design process continued. A Technical Study was 
prepared and submitted in 2006.  
 
The main goal of this study was to assess the most cost-effective and water efficient design 
that secures the water demands for the beneficiaries throughout the year considering the existing and 
expected constraints
.
Among the specific objectives of the Technical Study, the following are of 
particular interest: 
-
Revise the design-related elements in the PPIAF study and other previous ones. 
-
Develop a phased approach for project implementation. 
-
System sizing based on crop pattern in the project area. 
-
Determine the site impacts of providing surface water to the project area. 
-
Prepare the main parameters required to develop the Terms of Reference for a private 
contractor to build and operate the system. 
 
Although the Technical Study makes available valuable information on the direction of the 
design process, the pre-feasibility nature of its designs doesn't allow for final conclusions on the 
project design and implementation, and hence doesn't allow for final statements on environmental 
and social impacts of WDWCIRP. 
 
3.3 
Project proposal 
The WDWCIRP
’s irrigation system design has not yet crystallized fully. This is logical since the 
final design will be contracted out to the service provider under a design-build-operate construction 
(DBO contractor).  
A precise project description is therefore hard to give. The following aims to 
summarize which essential choices have been made in the design preparation process, and will 
figure as prerequisites for the contractor. The information has been derived from the Preliminary 
Information Notice 
(PIN 2006)
 and the Technical Study 
(TS 2005),
 as well as from personal 
communication 
(PC)
 with several people involved in the project preparation. 
Project size and location 
The WDWCIRP project, as indicated in the PAD, encompasses a concession area of 80,000 
ha. The northern zone (27,300 ha.) delineated in earlier studies is 
not
 part of the WDWCIRP 
anymore. The WDWCIRP location is shown in Figure 3.2 and is composed of the Sections S 01 
through S 10. 
Phasing of WDWCIRP and priority sections
The loan of the World Bank allows for a maximum size of implementation of an order of 
magnitude of 38,000 ha. (World Bank loan 70%, other donors loan 15%, equity funds by the private 
Page  18
18
sector 15% of total investment). The connected farms will be located in a so called concession area 
of 80,000 ha. (See Table 3.1). Where exactly the connections will be is not yet known. It largely 
depends on the willingness of investors to connect.

Alignment of piped connection system
Surface water will be distributed through closed conduits. Figure 3.2 shows the layout of the 
main pipe network and boundaries of sections as outlined in the TS 2005. These are preliminary 
designs which are subject to change in the final design. The pipelines will be buried and the land 
will remain available for agriculture with minor limitations. 
Pumping station on Rayah el Nasseri
The pumping station for WDWCIRP will take water out of the Rayah el Nasseri. The exact 
location is still to be determined in relation to the final design of the pipe network 
(PC)
.
Provisionally it is situated at kilometer 22 of this canal 
(TS 2005).
 
Supplementary Pumping Station (SPS)
The Government of Egypt will build a SPS on the Rosetta Branch to supply the Rayah el 
Nasseri with additional water. This SPS is part of the WDIIP project and will primarily supply the 
Nubariya Command Area with additional water. The SPS will also replenish the water that is used 
by the WDWCIRP project. The incremental investments in the SPS for WDWCIRP will be paid for 
by WDWCIRP over a 20 year period. 
System capacity
The water duty for WDWCIRP is established at 12,376 m
3
/ha./y. all losses included. This 
amount may be increased with a 5% water allocation for non-agricultural uses. The maximum intake 
capacity is determined at 21.3 m3/sec. 
(TS 2005)
 
Irrigation
Irrigation will only be allowed through drip and sprinkler systems. Conjunctive use of 
surface water and groundwater is possible and permitted under the present regulations. . 
Drainage system
Drainage systems are not foreseen in WDWCIRP. The project doesn't provide extra water 
for leaching. 
 
3.4 
Project components 
 
The project’s total investment cost for Component No. 1 is US$205 million, of which a 
World Bank loan will finance US$145 million, with the remainder sourced from the farmers and the 
private operator, and donor funding.  In addition, an additional US$8 million will be made available 
as grants and sub-loans to farmers from bilateral donors (AFD and the Netherlands) for Component 
Nos. 2 and 3.  
 
Component No. 1:  Design, Construct, and Start Up of the Surface Water System, and 
Connection Program for Participating Farms 
(US$205 million). - This component will finance 
activities leading to the final design and construction of a surface water irrigation system for the 
project area of an order of magnitude of38,000 ha in the West Delta. Initial design work was carried 
out during the technical preparation studies which were based on a “demand-driven approach to 
planning” where the growers’ willingness to connect and pay guided the technical design options 
with commensurate tariffs.  In addition, a piped system was chosen as the preferred option given its 
several advantages over open channel systems, particularly with regard to efficient water resource 
use and lower environmental and social safeguards risks.  The final design will be completed by the 
private operator that will be contracted to construct and operate the system on a long term basis. A 
fixed allocation of water resource will be made available by the government to the project area, 
based on the estimated average annual requirement of 12,376 m
3
per year per ha.  The preliminary 
design of the system has been sized to meet the peak demand in the summer months.  Over the 
entire year, total usage converges to the annual average.  Based on this, it is anticipated that the 
Page  20
20
surface water system would meet most of the water resource needs of the farms that will be 
connecting, allowing the aquifers to recharge and to benefit farmers in adjacent areas.   
 
Component No. 2:  Market-driven Technical Assistance to Small and Medium Scale 
Farmers (
US$2 million
)
–
This component will be initially funded through donor grants by AFD 
and will provide technical assistance (TA) to small and medium growers, traders, food processors, to 
increase West Delta products (fresh or processed) market share on national and international 
markets. Technical assistance to small and medium size growers, traders, exporters and food 
processors will be provided in the following areas:  
·
production, post harvest technology and farm management to small and medium size 
growers to improve competitiveness and quality of products,  
·
market intelligence (for local and export market) and logistics to small growers, traders 
and exporters, to look for new market opportunity and/or increase market share, 
·
food processing, packing and marketing to food processors, to improve competitiveness 
and/or create new food products, 
·
organizational arrangement for growers, traders and/or food processors to work in a 
coordinated manners within formal or informal organizations to achieve economy of scale and 
improve supply chain competitiveness. 
 
Following a successful evaluation of the first donor phase activity, loan facilitation would be 
provided directly to participating farmers. 
 
Component No. 3: Support for Institutional Development and Capacity Building of 
Project Management Unit, Regulatory Office and Water User Organization  (
US$6
 
million
)
–
This component will be funded through donor grants by the Government of the Netherlands and will 
support capacity building of MWRI for PPP contract management, Construction Supervision 
Consultant, regulatory oversight, and to the user association along the lines of the policies for 
institutional reforms proposed by the MWRI and in cooperation with the Government of The 
Netherlands.   In addition, it will support activities to disseminate on possible replication of the 
adopted PPP approach to other areas in Egypt and its riparian neighbors.  
 
The main capacity building activities financed under this component include: (i) strengthening the 
PMU and the contract management activities that will oversee contractual matter between the 
Government and the private operators on all aspects of the implementation phases, including 
environmental and social safeguard compliance during the implementation of the project inclusive 
of groundwater monitoring; (ii) capacity building of economic regulatory office to ensure effective 
regulatory oversight and equitable treatment of interests between the farmers and the private 
operator; and (iii) capacity building of the water user association that will be formed to oversee the 
relationship between farmers vis-à-vis entitlements and usage of the surface and ground water 
resources. Given the unique nature of the PPP transaction arrangement the TA will also provide for 
oversight supervisory engineers and technical audits of technical milestones achieved.

Law 12 is of particular interest because the amended (but not yet ratified) version regulates the legal 
status and powers of the Water Boards.  
 
Water Quality is addressed separately by two laws and three decrees. The most significant 
are Law 48 of 1982 and Law 93 of 1962.  Further, Law 4 of 1994 plays a role in the management 
and protection of water quality.  These laws are discussed in some detail in Annex III. 
 
The Supreme Council of Antiquities is responsible for the protection and conservation of 
Cultural Properties. This is taken care of in the contracts prepared by the MWRI (Clause 25 of the 
MWRI general contract no. 3333-b), which states: 
 
"All antiquities that can be found by the contractor during the excavations should be remitted 
directly to the office belonging to the High Council of Antiquities. In the case of projects occurring 
in or close to an antiquities area, the High Council of Antiquities is responsible to bring technical 
laborers to observe the location and the antiquities which cost is covered by the contractor". 
4.1.3 Administrative framework
Ministry of Water Resources and Irrigation (MWRI) 
 
The MWRI has sole legal responsibility for the planning and management of all water 
resources in Egypt. It is responsible for providing water of suitable quality to all users. To 
accomplish this goal, the Ministry has to ensure that appropriate measures are undertaken to protect 
both the quantity and the quality of Egypt's water resources. With increasing trends of pollution, 
MWRI is intensifying its attention towards pollution control and water quality management. A 
national water quality monitoring system was established with enhanced information system to 
support policy development and decision making. The NWRP established the basis for inter-
ministerial coordination for water resources management with priority focus on water quality. In 
practice, water quality management is still a major challenge facing MWRI and only the coming 
years will show how effective will be the recent policies and intervention in combating the pollution 
problem. Law 48 for the protection of the Nile and its waterways assigns to MWRI legal respon-
sibility over the following functions: 
-
Issue and cancellation of discharge permits into Egyptian waterways, which include the Nile, 
canals and drainage networks, lakes and groundwater reservoirs; 
-
Inspection of wastewater treatment facilities; 
Page  23
23
-
Monitoring of intake sites for potable water treatment plants as well as municipal and 
industrial discharges; 
-
Delegating responsibility of proper sampling and analyses of suspected discharges to the 
Ministry of Health;  
-
Levying of fines for non-compliance; 
-
Setting of regulations and specifications for discharges into water bodies; 
-
Issue and oversee of licenses for new waste treatment units in floating vessels; 
-
Issue of licenses for the construction of any establishment that directly discharges into 
waterways; 
-
The MWRI through its National Water Research Center (NWRC) ) operates its own water 
quality monitoring system.  The Water Quality Management Unit (WQMU) conduct water 
quality studies, enhance public awareness and engages in regional and national level strategic 
water quality debates. 
-
The specialized departments of MWRI (EPADS, NS, IS, GWS) monitor violations of law 48 
by discharges not meeting the standards specified in the by-laws. 
-
While awaiting the amended Law 12 to be ratified, MWRI has the powers to establish Water 
User's Organizations (WUAs, WUOs, and Water Councils) by Ministerial Decree and 
determine their functions. 
 
With regard to land acquisition and expropriation for irrigation and drainage projects, the 
MWRI has special responsibilities. These are described in detail in the Resettlement Policy 
Framework for WDWCIRP, which has been drafted in parallel with this ESIA/ESMP. 
Ministry of Health and Population (MoHP) 
 
The MoHP has been given a central role in water quality management, especially in setting 
standards for the quality of the following: 
·
Potable water sources (River Nile, canals and groundwater wells); 
·
Drain water that can be mixed with other water for drinking water; 
·
Industrial and sewage treatment plant discharges; 
·
Wastes discharged from river vessels; 
·
Besides developing standards, the MoHP is responsible for sampling and analyzing all 
industrial and municipal effluents and all drinking water treatment plant influents and effluents 
as well, which is considered a significant load of work. 
Ministry of Environmental Affairs /EEAA 
 
At the national level, the recently established Ministry of Environmental Affairs (MoEA) has 
the portfolio for environment in the Egyptian Cabinet of Ministers. Within this Ministry, the EEAA 
has the responsibility for setting national policy for the environment and coordinating environmental 
management activities within the government. The EEAA’s functions, as established by law 4/1994, 
include: 
·
Conducting studies; formulating the national plan for environmental protection; 
·
Preparing legislation, decrees, and regulations as needed to protect the environment; 
·
Setting requirements for EIAs of projects; 
·
Monitoring compliance with standards and norms; 
·
Coordinating enforcement actions; managing natural protectorates; 
·
Promoting environmental education. 
 
Law 4/1994, the most recent and comprehensive law gives the EEAA the authority to 
regulate air pollution, management of hazardous wastes, and discharges to the marine environment. 
Page  24
24
Furthermore, the law gives the EEAA an array of tools for implementing and enforcing these 
provisions, including traditional regulatory controls (e.g.. emission standards for air pollutants), 
economic instruments, compliance monitoring, inspection, and enforcement (e.g., penalties, 
closures, and imprisonment). 
 
Thus the EEAA has significant authority over industry under this law, including the 
authority to require industries to keep records of the environmental impact of their activities, to 
collect and analyze samples to ensure that standards are being met, and in the case of a violation to 
shut down a facility within 60 days if the violation has not been corrected. 
 
The EEAA has promulgated regulations (Executive Regulations, 1995 
http://www.eeaa.gov.eg/english/main/law4.asp
)
regarding air pollution, marine discharge, and EIA 
provisions of the law and is in the process of completing regulations for the management of 
hazardous substances and wastes. Some provisions were amended by Prime Minister
’s Decree No. 
1741 of 2005.  The law granted industry a three-year grace period (until March 1998) to comply 
with the new standards. An additional two-year extension was available to those industries that 
submitted an application by August 1997 and prepared a Compliance Action Plan (CAP) by the end 
of 1997, demonstrating their progress in meeting the standards. However, this additional extension 
was rejected by the Prime Minister and the CAP activity was halted. 
Ministry of Housing, Utilities and New Communities (MoHUNC) 
 
Within the Ministry of Housing, Utilities and Urban Communities (MHUNC), the National 
Organization for Potable Water and Sanitary Drainage (NOPWASD) has the responsibility for 
planning, design and construction of municipal drinking water purification plants, distribution 
systems, sewage collection systems, and municipal wastewater treatment plants. Once the facilities 
have been installed, NOPWASD organizes training, but the responsibilities for operation and 
maintenance are left to the regional or local authorities. NOPWASD is supposed to inspect each 
plant regularly, but in practice this very much depends on the cooperation of the respective 
governorates. Many domestic wastewater treatment plants are currently in poor condition. The 
Holding Company for Water and Wastewater, established by virtue of the Presidential Decree 
number 135/2004, under the Minister of MUNHC, has been entrusted the general economic 
authorities and public sector companies for water and wastewater in Cairo, Alexandria, Beheira, 
Damietta, Sharqia, Gharbia, Kafr El Sheikh, Dakahlia, Fayoum, BeniSuef, Minia and Aswan. It has 
its judicial personality according to the provisions of Law 203/1991 and its executive regulation. 
Purpose of the company is treating, transporting, transmitting and selling drinking water; and 
collecting, treating and safely disposing wastewater by itself or by its subsidiary companies as well 
as establishing, managing and rotating a portfolio to ensure financing bonds, stocks and instruments 
and any other financial tools or instruments.  
Ministry of Industry and Trade 
 
Within the Ministry of Industry and Mineral Wealth (MIMW), the General Organization for 
Industrialization (GOFI) supervises pollution control, safety and health issues in industry through its 
General Department for Environmental Protection. It also ensures that new plants include industrial 
waste treatment units. Ministerial decree No. 380 of 1982 requires compliance with all applicable 
environmental laws, regulations, and standards as a condition for granting industrial licenses. A 
clause to this effect is written into all industrial licenses granted by the Ministry, committing the 
industry to taking the necessary preventive measures, such as installing necessary control 
equipment. However, GOFI does not perform any inspections at industries and, therefore, does not 
monitor whether industries are actually in compliance with these license requirements. 
Page  25

Ministry of the Interior 
 
The Ministry of Interior (MoI), Egypt's national police force, has for some time maintained 
the Inland Water Police, a special police force for enforcement of Law 48 and protection of the 
environment in general. The Inland Water Police provide guidance to citizens and take enforcement 
actions for violations of environmental laws. Law 4/1994 provides additional authority for this 
environmental police force, specifying that the MoI shall form a police force specialized in 
environmental protection within the ministry and in its Security Departments in the governorates 
(Article 65 of the executive regulations).  
 
According to law 48, the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Transportation have 
also some responsibilities (article 7 & 10). 
 
4.2 
EIA and ESIA requirements for World Bank 
 
Based on the scoping exercise conducted through the strategic DRAINFRAME assessment, 
three drivers of change that could have potential positive and negative impacts were identified. This 
together with the updated addendum to the DRAINFRAME analysis guided the formulation of the 
ESIA. The drivers are:  
 
Avoidance of impacts on old lands
.
In order to avoid the large export oriented units in the 
project area being developed at the cost of productivity in smaller family units in the old lands, and 
thus creating serious longer-term income and livelihood constraints, it is important to introduce 
sustainable water management systems including both the project area and the rest of the Nile Delta. 
This is supposedly addressed by the NWRP. 
 
Avoidance of unsustainable groundwater use
.
The project will seek to reduce the level of 
dependence on groundwater in the project area. Therefore the implications of conjunctive ground 
and surface water use on the recharge capacity of groundwater aquifers, and the broader 
environmental and social impacts, should be assessed for the project area and, as necessary, in the 
larger area of influence.  
 
Avoidance of negative impacts of induced development
.
The study will identify those 
elements of the induced development that are likely to take place within the project area and in the 
larger area that would have a potential adverse impact on the sustainability of the project objectives.  
 
Safeguards policy requirements of the World Bank.
 The World Bank screening also 
identified the safeguard policies that could be triggered by the project (Table 4.2).

Impact assessment and identification of measures 
5.1 
Methodology: A nested hierarchy of environmental studies 
 
The creation of a Public Private Partnership for the provision of irrigation water with full 
cost recovery is a relatively new procedure for which there is no clearly defined project formulation 
path available. Especially the timing of the environmental and social assessment is difficult. The 
highly participative nature of this particular process has all characteristics of  learning by doing 
approach, making use of best available international knowledge, and internationally recognized tools 
such as SEA and EIA.

Figure 5.1
 
Project formulation process including environmental and social assessment 
 
Figure 5.1 provides a simplified overview of the steps in project formulation and the moment 
that impact assessment plays its role. The WDWCIRP project started with a preliminary technical 
assessment 
(PPIAF 2005).
 The PPIAF provided a general framework on how to address the 
predictable future problems of groundwater availability in the West Delta region by means of 
surface water supply through a public-private partnership (PPP) and the willingness of the 
beneficiaries to connect on a full cost recovery basis. 
 
This preliminary study provided the basis for the DRAINFRAME study, which has all 
characteristics of an integrated Strategic Environmental Assessment. Integrated in the sense that 
economic, social and environmental aspects are taken into account; strategic in the sense that it 
offers options for decisions by policy makers at the higher levels guided by stakeholders perceptions 
and the national interest in achieving sustainable development. This could help avoiding costly 
mistakes and providing additional input to the technical, operational and institutional measures 
needed to guarantee the sustainability of the project. 
 
The early stages of the planning process have been highly participatory. The preliminary 
PPIAF study was based on a number of stakeholder workshops and interviews throughout the 
project area. The focus was on identifying the needs and aspirations of farmers in the West Delta 
area. The DRAINFRAME study has extended the participation to other stakeholders who, based on 
the strategic assessment can be identified as potentially affected by the project.  
Page  28
28
The outreach study made sure that all farmers in the area are aware of the process (in stead 
of sampled groups) to guarantee broad knowledge of and contributions to the planning process. 
DRAINFRAME and outreach studies have determined the scope of a further detailed technical 
study. This technical study, however, is 
NOT
 a
final design, but provides the boundary conditions 
for the bidding process.  
 
An environmental and social impact assessment is a requirement for all World Bank 
supported projects. The ESIA at hand moves from the broad overview provided by the 
DRAINFRAME study, to more detailed project level impact assessment. However, as the final 
design of the project is not available yet, some issues remain unresolved. Consequently, the impact 
assessment in many instances cannot go further than defining the various tasks and responsibilities 
of both private and public partners in the remaining phases the present ESIA in these cases provides 
a
framework for further work. 
 
The final design will be made by the private service provider selected from the bid on the 
PPP project. This party will have to perform an EIA according to Egyptian law, but will be able to 
make use of all material already available. This EIA study consequently can focus on a detailed 
ESMP (including monitoring and mitigation measures, and potential capacity development needs) 
for the activities under responsibility of the private operator. Similarly government has to play its 
part in the impact assessment process by elaborating an ESMP for the tasks under its responsibility.  
 
The use of strategic environmental assessment at the earliest possible stage of project 
formulation has guaranteed the incorporation of environmental and social issues in the design 
process. The information collected during the process has been used effectively to reduce the 
workload in the next stages. 
The Present Study 
 
The present study uses the DRAINFRAME analysis as its point of departure and 
consequently avoids unnecessary repetition. The following steps have been made in a chronological 
manner:  
I: First field mission: September 2006 
·
Discussion of ToR with relevant sectors at Ministry of Water Resources & Irrigation and 
with World Bank representatives. Identification of information needs.  
·
Study of technical reports and appraisal of the design choices that have been made in the 
technical study.  
·
Redefinition of drivers of change and expected impacts from earlier DRAINFRAME 
analysis, in the light of project design choices that have been made (technology applied and 
boundaries of intervention area).   
II: Combined desk and field research 
·
Where possible, further quantification of effects and impacts. The focus lied on a more 
detailed model analysis of the expected physical changes in surface and groundwater 
hydrology, through the TRIWACO groundwater model.  
·
Inventory of relevant water quality data from Rahawi drain, Rosetta branch, and Nubariya 
canal. 
·
Limited field and desk research on induced development. 
Page  29
29
III: Second field mission (November 2006)
·
Discussion on latest modeling results; collection of remaining information. 
·
Compilation of first draft report 
IV: Finalization of report.
·
Forwarding of the draft ESIA report to MWRI and World Bank for comments. 
·
Final draft submitted by MWRI to World Bank and public disclosure. 
·
Forwarding to the Board of the World Bank for approval.  
Structure of the assessment  
 
The DRAINFRAME assessment pointed out that three interventions by the WDWCIRP 
project are important for the environmental and social impacts which may be triggered by the 
project.   
1. 
Withdrawal of water from the Nile for the project area. 
2. 
The surface water supply is limited and may dictate the use of groundwater during peak water 
requirement periods. 
3. 
The intensification and expansion of the agricultural production will induce new socio-
economic developments in the WDR. 
 
Apart from these three main drivers of change, the ESIA at hand will assess whether and to 
what extent the safeguard policies of the World Bank are triggered by the project, notably on i) 
natural habitats, ii) involuntary resettlement, iii) cultural physical property, and iv) pest 
management. 
 
Finally, the potential effects and impacts of the actual construction of the project, if not yet 
dealt with in one of the above themes, will be reviewed. 
 
5.2 
Project area, cumulative effects and extended area of influence. 
 
The project area proper, to which this ESIA directly relates, is defined in Section 3.3. It has 
an area in the order of magnitude of 38,000 ha. (See also Fig. 3.2). It should be noted that the 
northern sector of the initial WDWCIRP proposal doesn't form part of it anymore 
(PIN 2006).
 
The World Bank will provide a loan for WDWCIRP. This loan represents (70%), while other 
donor funds contribute (15%) and an equity fund by the private sector is (15%). The World Bank 
loan and other funding sources will cover the development of an area in the order of magnitude 
of38,000 ha cultivable land out of a total concession area of 80,000 ha.  
 
The Government of Egypt will construct a new pumping station on the Rosetta Branch to 
replenish the water used by the project. The WDWCIRP will pay its proportional share in 
operational costs annually and of the investments over a 20 year period. These supplementary 
supply facilities don't figure in this ESIA. 
 
Based on the DRAINFRAME assessment of the hydrological linkages of the project with 
other areas in Egypt and the update made in this study, the following extended area of influence has 
been taken into account in the assessment:  
·
The
 Old land 
including all command areas relying on Nile water (DRAINFRAME considered 
only the Old Land of the Nile delta). 
·
Wadi-el-Natrun 
which is
 
influenced through the connected aquifer.  
·
The 
Nubariya and Bustan command area 
which may experience a change in water quality. 
·
The groundwater
 irrigated areas which will not be connected to the pipeline system. 
 
Presently no other new projects like WDWCIRP are likely hence there will be no cumulative 
effects.

5.3 
Main Driver 1: withdrawal of water from the Nile system 
 
This section deals with the impacts that will be generated when significant amounts of water 
will be reallocated from the Nile system to the project. Details of assumptions, analyses and esults 
are presented in Annex IV. For the recalculation of the impacts, use has been made of the same 
computational tools that where used in the DRAINFRAME assessment. SIWARE is used to assess 
the impacts on the Old Land and TRIWACO to assess the impact on ground water levels. West 
Delta Quantitative Assessment Sheets (WDQUAS) were designed by the study team for impacts on 
jobs, agricultural production value, and conjunctive groundwater use. It goes without saying that the 
conclusions are dependant on the assumption made by the study team which is not necessarily 
taking the future government plans for water resources management fully into consideration.  
Potential impacts of withdrawal of water from the Nile system 
In the WDWCIRP project area groundwater for irrigation will be replaced by surface water. 
The surface water will be pumped from the Nile system. Because the Nile system is already being 
used intensively, negative effects and impacts on the present users of Nile water are potentially to 
occur if no mitigating measures are taken.  
 
On the other hand creeping urbanization within the Nile delta has led to the rapid loss of 
cultivable land.  Comparisons of digital mosaics of LANDSAT MSS and TM scenes, acquired over 
the Nile Delta suggest significant changes in land use as shown below. 
 Year 
Change in land use from agriculture to urban (%) 
1972-1984 3.6 
1984-1990 5.7 
As the pace of rural-urban land conversion continues unabated, by 2010 Egypt would have 
lost as much as 12% (about 288, 000 ha) of its best agricultural lands to urbanization in the past 38 
years.  One consequence of this trend in the Nile Delta is that a substantial quantity of water is no 
longer utilized for irrigated agriculture. Assuming the current average annual consumption of 20,500 
cubic meters per ha by the irrigated farmlands (which have among the highest yields in the world 
and a cropping intensity of more than 200%), the reduction in the Delta water usage in this period 
can be estimated to be about 5.5 BCM , even allowing for the increased water usage by urban 
consumers. 
 
The water available for all other uses and users decreases by about 0.7% in case 37,800 ha 
are fully developed. If this water is reallocated proportionally from all existing agricultural uses, the 
impacts will be various but minimal and difficult to quantify. It is even too small compared with the 
envisage water savings from the on-going irrigation improvement program and the other measures 
specified in the NWRP. The impacts, if any, will include reduced benefits from farms and fisheries, 
lower water quality and environmental degradation of the coastal zone. Some measures will mitigate 
if not avoid that such impacts may occur. 
 
The potential impacts of WDWCIRP have been assessed for the with and withoput project 
case as indicated in Table 5.1. The annual water supply is calculated by the ESIA study team, using 
design criteria from the technical study, information from the HEPS and a reference cropping 
pattern and evapo-transpiration based on field data

The potential impact on agricultural production value in the delta was estimated in 
Drainframe 2005. Table 5.2 gives updated figures for case O and A to indicate the order of 
magnitude of the impact on agricultural production in the Old Lands without mitigating measures.

Under the same set of assumptions The DRAINFRAME study showed also potentially 
adverse impacts on salinity of drainage water, domestic water quality and fish production 
(Drainframe 
2005)
.
The above estimates of loss of agricultural values and other adverse impacts could be 
regarded as over estimates as it is  not taking into consideration the water savings due to agricultural 
land loss due to urbanization and other water saving measures. 
 
The National Water Resources Plan 2017 
(NWRP 2004)
,
makes a comprehensive and 
integrated analysis of Egypt's present and future water resources. Based on this NWRP, the 
Government of Egypt has adopted the National Water Policy 2017: "Water for the Future" as its 
official water policy for the coming years (Annex II). The NWRP shows that a horizontal expansion 
program with Nile water can be realized through a set of water saving and water management 
interventions. Number of these interventions, such as irrigation improvement in old lands, is already 
in progress such as the IIIMP.
 
However, justification of new allocations of Nile water for horizontal expansion should be 
obtained from demonstrable structural surpluses in the water balance. This is expected to be the 
subject of the second phase of the NWRP which well set the details of a policy implementation 
action plan. The existing comprehensive monitoring program (Box 5.1) of the Nile water 
distribution (particularly over the main system components) can be used to evaluate the water 
balance of the past say 10 years, and the results can be used to justify the allocation of water for 
WDWCIRP.  
Box 5.1: Operation of the Nile system 
The main Nile system downstream of the HAD is operated by the Central Administration of Water 
Distribution (CAWD). The control system consists of the main barrages and main canal intakes. Annually, 
before the new hydraulic year begins on August 1, a water allocation plan is prepared, based on historical data 
(what has been delivered in foregoing years) and actual changes in the demand. This plan is discussed and 
negotiated with the institutional stakeholders of water (MHUNC, MARL, etc.). H.E. the Minister of MWRI 
approves the new plan.  
The day to day operation of the system is governed by actual demands. At the directorate level, Agriculture 
provides MWRI every 10 days with data on cropping patterns. After review, the Directorates send this 
information to CAWD, where the new demands are calculated in a comprehensive spreadsheet and 
instructions are given to gate operators to adjust the settings accordingly. Monitoring of the delivery of water 
amounts happens on a daily basis near the control structures, and if water levels deviate too much from the 
planned ones, intermediate adjustment can be made. The operation of HAD is given to a special sector, so 
CAWD sents a request every 10 days to HAD for a certain amount of water during the forthcoming period, 
which then will be honored within the limits of the total Nile water availability for Egypt. 
2
"Cropping pattern adapted" refers to a situation that farmers themselves will adapt their cropping patterns to less water 
consumptive crops when they experience a structural decrease of water supply.  
Page  32

Apart from the above described need to save water in function of new uses, there is an 
immediate management decision required in case a new pumping station of considerable size on the 
Nile system starts working. An operational plan has to be in place that regulates the water 
allocations in the Nile system for the new water uses. From oral communication with the CAWD, 
this will be done in the annual water use plans. Without further instructions, the water will be sliced 
from the amounts which used to be available for all other main parts of the system.  It is not foreseen 
that such slicing will cause major reductions in agricultural value due to: (i) the amount to be sliced 
is too small because of the project size in comparison to the current water allocations, (iii) progress 
in implementing water saving project such as IIIMP, and (iii) land loss due to urbanization continues 
with no clear indication of slow down. 
 
According the assumptions made and analyses carried out, taking water from the Nile for the 
project has three main effects: 
A: The 
water available
 for all other uses and users decreases by about 0.7% in the case of 
project developing 37,800 ha, while not taking into consideration water savings due to 
urbanization of agricultural lands. If this water is reallocated proportionally from all existing 
agricultural uses, the impacts will be various but too small and difficult to quantify, even in 
case the whole of the groundwater fed area is connected in full to the surface water system.  
 Measures 
 Implementation of the National Water Resources Plan under a new Water Policy: 
Water for 
the Future
 is underway
3
.
If the measures of the NWRP that have been started already are 
successfully completed, savings of water in the Nile system will be sufficient to make up for 
the water requirements of the project. Moreover, the Implementation Support Project for 
NWRP, which aims at sequencing and prioritizing  a range of other NWRP measures, has 
recently been approved by both MWRI and the Government of the Netherlands and will 
most likely become operational within a year. Under this project the water balance of the 
Nile system will be monitored closely to assure that "new plans for horizontal expansion of 
agricultural area will be made dependent on further water saving measures or the availability 
of additional water resources" (ARE, 2005). The WDWCIRP project management will, as an 
input in the NWRP process, identify specific water saving measures which relate to the 
project 
(M.1)
). These measures, which will seek to ensure adequate supply through the Nile, 
will include, among others, the following:  (a) the promotion of scaling-up within the old 
lands, as a priority, the successful results of the Bank-financed IIIMP project which has 
demonstrated the viability of achieving the dual benefits of water savings and improving 
productivity water 
(M.2A)
;
(b) get project area prioritized and targeted for water saving 
measures by GOE, by seeking a direct reference to the WDWCIRP area within the official 
documentation pertaining to the  Horizontal Expansion Program (e.g. for rapidly urbanizing 
areas) 
(M.2B)
.
To ensure adequate water supply through the Nile systems, and avoid constraints or shortfall, 
the DBO contractor and the attached service standards will specify that the operator has to 
provide the MWRI the monthly water requirements for the upcoming year (
M.3
). That will 
be followed with his daily requirements to be submitted 10 days before the beginning of each 
month. This will enable the MWRI to adjust its operational planning for water distribution in 
time to ensure adequate water supplies for the project and rest of the system. In any case, a 
fixed allocation of water will be made available by the government to the project area, based 
on the estimated average annual requirement of 12,376 m
3
per year per ha.  The preliminary

–
the West Delta Irrigation Improvement 
Project. The WDWCIRP is a first component of this program. 
Page  33

design of the system has been sized to meet most of the peak demand in the summer months. 
Over the entire year, total usage converges to the annual average. Based on this, it is 
anticipated that the surface water system would meet most of the water needs of the farms 
that will be connecting, allowing the aquifers to be conserved and to benefit farmers in 
adjacent areas. 
 
B: The 
hydrology of the Rosetta Branch
 will change. The water taken for the project is 
compensated by water from the Rosetta Branch diverted to the Rayah el Nasseri downstream from 
the project intake. This means that the upper stretch of the river, starting from Delta Barrage, will 
have to convey higher average and peak discharges and consequently get higher water levels. As a 
consequence also the erosion and sedimentation regime will change. Because encroachment of the 
river banks by agriculture and buildings took place since the regime of the river stabilized after the 
construction of High Aswan Dam, higher water levels may have adverse effects on these functions.
 
Measures 
 
An ex-ante assessment of the potential hydrological changes in the Rosetta Branch is underway, 
and the conclusions of this study would inform the ESMP of this project of the design and 
timing of required specific mitigation measures to guard against any potential river bank 
flooding, erosion and sedimentation of the Rosetta Branch 
(M.4
). This assessment has been 
assigned by MWRI to the NRI. The mitigation measures will be in line with the concomitant 
procedure for involuntary resettlement, if there is any expropriation involved (see Section 4.2 
(iv)). The situation will be monitored following the commencement of any hydrological changes 
in the Rosetta Branch. 
C:  The 
water quality
 in the water system of the West Delta region will change.  
 
Rayah el Beheiri and Rayah el Nasseri take water of good quality upstream of Delta Barrage. 
Urban and agricultural drainage water (especially the Rahawi drain and the Sabal drain) pollutes 
the relatively small flow of the Rosetta branch downstream of Delta Barrage (Figure 5.3). 
 
Figure 5.3
:
Situation sketch of West Delta Main Water System 
 
Page  34
34
The potential problems of water quality in relation to the West Delta Region are twofold: 
1. 
The water quality of Nile water may be low to be used for certain cultures in the new land. 
Some farmers may decide, as a mitigating measure, to continue using high quality 
groundwater for certain crops, albeit groundwater salinity will not be a limiting factor, thus 
contributing to more stress on the aquifers.  
2. 
If the good quality water of the Rayah el Nasseri is used for the WDWCIRP and this water 
is replaced by lower quality Rosetta Branch water further downstream, this will have an 
effect on the water quality in the Nubariya and Bustan water conveyance systems and of 
the Rosetta Branch, and potentially a negative impact on the water users there. Further 
downstream on the Nubariya canal there are several water treatment plants for drinking 
water (Alexandria and local). Diverting more water of lower quality instead of more clean 
water to the Nubariya Canal will add to the problems of the drinking water treatment. 
These companies may object to the decrease of water quality.  
 
Due to higher discharges of relatively clean water in the Rosetta Branch to meet the project 
water demands, its quality will improve because of the dilution of untreated sewage which is 
disposed in the Rosetta Branch by several drains. The downstream command area of 
Mahmoudia, and some smaller ones as well as another Alexandrian municipal water plant and 
the fish farming community will benefit from this effect.  
 
The situation is rather complex, and a quantitative analysis is required to show the magnitude of 
the problem. A study made by DRI for part of the conveyance system in the West Delta Region 
should be extended for a situation that includes the expected changes of water supply to the 
Nubariya Canal as a consequence of WDWCIRP. Preferably also of the whole WDIIP project 
should be considered. 
 Measures 
 
Sewage treatment in the catchments of the drains polluting the Rosetta would solve the problem 
all together. It is clear that such measures are beyond the reach of an environmental management 
plan of a single project. The NWRP proposes an extensive plan to that end, and GoE allocated 
about LE 20 billion in 2007 to improve sanitation in a national program. Planning mechanisms 
in the program include that the hot spots that are influencing water quality will get priority. This 
means that the WDWCIRP project management should, as a matter or urgency, identify and cost 
specific priority activities (e.g. improvement of the water quality of the Rahawi drain) within the 
project which could get priority in the national sewage treatment program under the NWRP. 
 
To get quantitative information on the future water quality in the West Delta Region, a water 
quality assessment study, aimed at identifying and costing specific priority programs for 
inclusion in the GOE, LE 20 billion sanitation plan should be undertaken urgently 
(M.5).  
This 
should be completed before WDWCIRP becomes operational. This study can be seen as a 
follow-up to the study that was recently completed for the Umum Project. This study should also 
provide the framework for an intensified water quality monitoring program in the main system. 
The study can be done by DRI under the supervision of MWRI. 
The outcomes of this assessment would provide the PMU with direct input into the NWRP, with 
an aim to identify and cost specific priority programs for inclusion in the GOE, LE 20 billion 
sanitation plan. (
M.6
).

5.4.1 Hydrogeology
The main aquifer systems are the Alluvium and the Moghra. Other secondary aquifer 
systems are the coastal and Wadi El Natrun aquifers. The main issues related to the project are: 
1) 
The general flow direction is basically from south-east to north-west; 
2) 
The main anomaly occurs along the Nubaryia canal due to seepage from the canal; 
3) 
Other anomalies prevail around the pumping centers; 
4) 
The changes in the depth to groundwater are a result of overexploitation  
5) 
The main source of recharge is seepage from surface water canals and excess irrigation 
in the surface-water fed areas; while discharge takes place either naturally through evaporation 
(wadi El Natrun depression), or artificially through pumping.  
6) 
The annual rate of pumping is about 1,080 cubic meters per year (2002). 
7) 
The groundwater salinity (TDS) ranges from 500 ppm (CaHCO
3
–
MgCO
3
types), in the 
east, to more than 4,000 ppm in the west (NaCl type). 
8) 
This indicates that the main source of salt in the east is the leaching with Nile water; 
while in the west, the source is from marine deposits. 
 
Figure 5.3 gives a general picture of the depth to groundwater in the project area. 
5.4.2 
Groundwater Vulnerability to Pollution
The groundwater vulnerability to pollution (a combination of the intrinsic vulnerability and 
total vulnerability) in the area is generally moderate (Figure 5.4). This is mainly because of the 
nature and characteristic of the aquifer and the depth to groundwater.

Simulation of water requirements for different cases and scenarios shows the following

Obviously, groundwater use will be reduced strongly if the project will be implemented. This 
positive impact should be counted for as a credit point. If the summer peak water requirement can be 
reduced, the groundwater use will decrease further. 
 
The scenarios tested in this section are mainly on the groundwater dynamics. Scenarios are 
defined in Table 5.6.

5.4.4 Test results 
Moghra and Nile aquifers 
 
The groundwater conditions under the different scenarios have been tested with TRIWACO, 
a
numerical program for quasi three-dimensional saturated and unsaturated groundwater flow, based 
on the finite element technique. The program can handle a variety of steady state and transient 
groundwater flow problems; taking into consideration the interaction between groundwater and 
surface water. The total area covered by the model amounts to 22,500 km2. Groundwater in most of 
the area is phreatic except the northern part of Nubariya Canal and the flood plain. 
 
The groundwater storage in the aquifers will respond to the gradual change in irrigation 
source from groundwater to surface water, which is also reflected by the stabilization of the depth to 
groundwater, and consequently the cost of pumping (table 5.7). The higher the percentage of the 
area connected to surface water, the more pronounced is the effect. 
Table 5.7. 
Cumulative change in storage and depth to groundwater as a response to different 
scenarios (year 2020)

The effect is quite pronounced in the Nile aquifer system due to the direct recharge from 
surface activities. The effect is less visible for the Moghra since it needs more time for the recharge 
to reach the aquifer.  
 
The groundwater quality depends on various factors, namely, the type and quality of the 
formations through which it moves and the original source and location of recharge. Additional 
changes may happen to the quality of groundwater due to any interruption that might affect the 
hydro chemical balance. 
 
In the case of the West Delta region, the original types of groundwater are Calcium 
Bicarbonate (in the eastern portion) becoming Sodium Chloride in the west. This indicates that in 
theeast, groundwater quality is directly affected by the recharge due to excess irrigation water 
diverted from the Nile; while in the western portion, the source of salts is rather due to the diffusion 
from the holding formation. 
 
Results of monitoring groundwater levels and salinity do not reflect general trends that relate 
(very closely) the change in depth to groundwater and the increase in salinity, except at few 
locations where either the thickness of the aquifer is small to the extent it does not allow for enough 
dilution (e.g Wadi El Natrun) or due to the enhancement of seepage from low quality (higher 
salinity) water bodies (e.g. Wadi El Natrun-El Alamein road).  
 
The impact of the project for the coming 14 years on the groundwater salinity is not reflected on 
groundwater in the Moghra aquifer (it will need more time), being of slight improve to the Nile aquifer 
system (a decrease of 10%). 
Results for Wadi el Natrun 
 
The lake of Wadi El Natrun is a natural depression north-west of the project area. The local 
lakes are maintained by upward seepage from the underlying aquifer due to geological structures. 
Due to the over-exploitation of groundwater in the last decades, the lake surface area has shrunk 
considerably. The simulation shows a recovery of the groundwater depth and hence a restoration of 
the lakes of Wadi el Natrun especially under scenario III.  The effect of the project on the recovery 
of the lake area is thus considered to be positive, although it will manifest itself slowly.  
 
Tables 5.7, 5.8 and 5.9 are summarizing the main impacts with possible remedial measures. 
Impacts and measures are discussed in the following section of this report.

5.4.5  Impacts and mitigation
Project area and around 
 
One of the objectives of the GoE for WDWCIRP is to diminish if not completely stop 
groundwater depletion. 
 
The project responds to the groundwater depletion and groundwater quality deterioration 
by supplying surface water for irrigation. Hence the project itself is a forceful mitigating measure 
for the presently unsustainable water supply system in the area. To which extent the project will 
succeed in this mitigation depends on several factors. 
 
It will be difficult to predict the balance between the use of groundwater and surface 
water. Moreover, the ratio between groundwater and surface water use may change seasonally, 
spatially as well as over time. The factors that potentially can influence the balance are many and 
very different in nature. They include: 
1.  Cost of surface water delivery compared to groundwater pumping 
2.  Surface Water duty assigned to the area (now set at 12,376 m3/ha). 
3.  Physical capacity of surface water delivery system (now set at 21.3 m3/sec). 
4.  Regulation of groundwater pumping (licensing and metering). 
5.  Existing groundwater wells, pumps and infrastructure. 
6. 
The suitability of surface water / groundwater for irrigating high value crops: 
-
bacteriological quality of surface water; 
-
salinity of groundwater; 
-
hazardous pollutants in either source. 
7. Cropping 
pattern: 
-
share of summer field crops; 
-
share of high water consuming crops (like bananas). 
8. Irrigation efficiency. 
9.  Recharge of aquifer. 
 
The combination of the water duty allocated for the project, the limitations posed on the 
design capacity of the pipeline system and the projections of the peak water requirement for the 
project when fully developed would make the surface water delivery fall short during about 4 
summer months. Since the groundwater pumping infrastructure will remain operational after the 
project sets on, it is likely that farmers will use the groundwater to make up for the shortages of 
surface water. This means that groundwater levels may continue to drop albeit in a much slower 
pace. The salinity of the groundwater has increased over the past decennia as a consequence of 
the overexploitation of the aquifers, whereas there are also signs of pollution from the upper 
surface. If this trend continues, deterioration of groundwater quality may not be fully stopped. 
Falling groundwater levels have also affected the groundwater situation in the deep depression of 
Wadi el Natrun, where people depend on spring water seeping in from the surrounding areas. 
Moreover, the wetland of Wadi el Natrun has shrunk.  
 
There are some positive factors that should be monitored closely. Firstly, many farmers 
produce with modern irrigation techniques and under the EurepGAP protocol. Drip irrigation 
strongly limits the percolation of water to the aquifers and hence the transfer of possible polluting 
substances from surface to ground water. The Integrated Pest Management requirements under 
the EurepGAP minimize the generation of agrochemical residuals. The integrated pest 
Page  40

management practices under the EurepGap protocol will be extended to those farmers which are 
not yet certified (which will address the Pest Management Policy of the World Bank). 
 
Secondly, the preliminary design of the system has been sized to meet most of the demand 
taking into account the possibility for conjunctive use of groundwater where required in the 
summer months. Over the entire year, total usage converges to the annual average. Based on this, 
it is anticipated that the surface water system would meet most of the water resource needs of the 
farms that will be connecting, allowing the aquifers to recharge and to benefit farmers in adjacent 
areas. The possibility to use the groundwater as an emergency source of water in case the surface 
water delivery fails thus can be maintained. 
 
In order to assure the GoE's objective to preserve the groundwater in the project area, 
additional mitigation measures are proposed to further promote improved future quality and 
quantity of ground water. 
Measures 
 
These measures will be dealt with as an Integrated and Sustainable Groundwater 
Management package (
M.7
). The first part of this package is the preparation of a plan which will 
explore a range of possible measures to mitigate adverse impacts on groundwater quantity and 
quality. This plan will also identify a site where these measures will be piloted. Implementation 
of the plan is made the responsibility of the Water User Council jointly with the Groundwater 
Sector of the MWRI. 
 
The range of possible measures which will be explored, in addition to the effect of the 
project itself, to keep the use of groundwater at a sustainable level include: i) restriction of 
cropping during summer, ii) modernization of irrigation technology for those farmers still not 
using such technologies, iii) storage of surface water in basins, iv) artificial recharge of the 
aquifer, and v) restrictive licensing of groundwater pumping. A combination of these measures 
will probably be the most attainable.  
 
To control the groundwater quality, the following possible measures are identified: vi) 
encouraging the adaptation of the integrated pest management practices under the EurepGap 
protocol by those farmers who are not yet certified (which will address the Pest Management 
Policy of the World Bank), vii) further development of modern fertilizer application techniques 
(also following EurepGap protocol), and viii) treatment of agro-industrial waste water, existing / 
new settlements sewerage water and solid waste.  
 
The Groundwater sector will (
M.8
)
intensify its already existing groundwater monitoring 
program in and around the project area. This monitoring program will include the adjacent area of 
Wadi el Natrun. In a later stage this may be instrumental in demonstrating the positive effect of 
the project on this particular area.

Main driver 3: Induced development 
 
A social impact study has been carried out to measure the expected social impact of the 
introduction of surface irrigation to the West Delta area on the establishment of new settlements 
and/or the expansion of already existing ones. A critical concern of the SIA is how benefits 
accrued or expected from the intervention project, usually defined in terms of income and social 
status are shared among groups of the population. By bringing forward the views, hopes, 
expectations and the knowledge of the available living conditions of these groups of people to 
policy-makers, the project can be fine-tuned to turn the project into an opportunity for sustainable 
social development of the West Delta area.

This chapter summarizes the findings of a rapid research undertaken in November 2006 to 
assess the social impacts of the WDWCIRP project (ANNEX VI). Qualitative research was used 
in this study to gain deeper understanding of the social wellbeing issues for the West Delta area. 
Semi structured qualitative questionnaires were used to facilitate discussion with 30 respondents, 
including farm managers, farm owners, investors, semi skilled laborers, skilled laborers (both 
residents and commuters). 
5.5.1 Impacts
There is no doubt that the project, once completed, will have a significant social impact. It 
will create employment and attract workers and their families (table 5.10). However, it is yet to 
be determined through which processes and which factors this impact will be felt. Different 
impacts can be expected in three different stages of the project: planning, construction and 
operation. 
Project planning stage 
 
Real, measurable and often significant effects on the human environment begin to take 
place from the time of the earliest announcement or even the rumor about a project. The West 
Delta project has been widely publicized and both hopes and speculations begin to mount. 
Speculators probably lock up potentially attractive pieces of land in anticipation of the accruing 
benefits. Land prices are already soaring high in the West Delta region especially those along the 
road.  
 
With the present information it is impossible to discern the effect of the proposed 
WDWCIRP project from other influences. For example, the construction of the Cairo-Alex desert 
road probably has had the most overwhelming impact on the development of the area and the 
land speculation, which is said to be widespread. The impact of the proposed upgrading of this 
road on land prices could be of the same magnitude as the prospect of a permanent supply of 
surface water. Along the desert road, estate development is a new and rapidly developing activity; 
the legal status of some of these activities is questionable and it is difficult to estimate the future 
direction of this development. It is certain that it involves large amount of investment money. The 
price of one feddan is said to be worth LE 35,000-50,000 now. 
 
Rental prices of flats in Sadat city have rocketed. Flats in Sadat city used to be rented for 
LE 100 per month. Now it is LE 250. It is very difficult to point to one reason for this. General 
trend of prices increase of real state in the country and future development prospects play a role, 
but certainly the increase in demand from the Menoufia university students (located in Sadat 
City) does so too. 
Construction stage  
 
The construction/implementation stage involves clearing land, building access roads, 
developing utilities camps etc. Possible environmental effects of these activities should be 
avoided or mitigated.  Displacement and relocation of farms would probably occur during this 
phase. These aspects are dealt with respectively under Sections 2.6 and 2.5 of the ESMP (Part II).  
Page  42

Operation/Maintenance 
Impact 1: Increased labor opportunities in agriculture: high.
When surface water is connected to farms, cultivated areas will increase due to the 
availability of irrigation water and due to the willingness of investors to invest more in the land 
and their feeling of security. This will definitely require more labor to join these farms.  
 
With spreadsheet WDQUAS the changes in job opportunities and value of agricultural 
production as a result of WDWCIRP have been reviewed. Table 5.10 summarizes the findings for 
Case O (without), and Case A (with project) for different scenarios of summer cropping.

Here the main conclusions are: 
·
Not implementing WDWCIRP results in a gradual decline of jobs and production value 
because of increasing salinity of groundwater and increasing energy costs. 
·
Implementation of WDWCIRP reverses these processes and allows for intensification of 
agriculture; hence jobs and agricultural value more than double. 
·
Restriction of summer cropping has a limited effect on the total value of agricultural 
production and permanent jobs, but a considerable effect (-15%) on temporary jobs.  
 
When working in the West Delta laborers have two options: 
·
Commuting
.
The most prevalent option is for workers to commute to their hometowns. 
There are two types of commuters. Those who commute daily to Menoufia, Beheira and 
nearby towns and those who stay on the farm for a week or two and commute back home on 
week ends. Farm management usually provides transportation on collection points for the 
first type.  
·
Migrating into the area. 
People may decide to migrate and settle in the area with their 
families. Increased labor opportunities may lead to increased immigration, causing social 
changes in the area which may be either beneficial for the development perspective of the 
area, or cause negative impacts and stress if social services and housing opportunities are 
insufficient. 
Impact 2: Migration & settlement: low
According to landowners there is no chance for the construction of new villages in the 
area, simply because there are no “empty lands left” for that purpose, as phrased by one farm 
Page  43
43
manager. Even the existing land between the different farms is very tight to allow any large 
settlements. 
 
The remaining option is to settle with their families in nearby cities and villages, such as 
El Sadat, Wadi Al Natrun, Khatatba or Adnan Madani. This means that these residential areas 
will grow in order to accommodate the incoming workers.  
 
While job and investment opportunities are important motivations to settle on a permanent 
basis, the communities in which workers and investors live greatly influence their decisions to 
settle. Availability of an acceptable level of basic services will contribute to viable communities 
and greater productivity. Such concerns are especially important in desert communities, which 
are relatively remot
e
from the country’s main service centers.  
 
Whereas economic incentives draw workers to the desert, it is their perception of the 
community social services and whether these are progressing, staying the same or deteriorating, 
that encourage them to bring along their families and remain there. Without adequate services and 
infrastructure, potential migrants may decide that movement as families to the desert is not worth 
the social costs despite the economic incentives, and instead they might decide, as is the case now 
with most workers in the West Delta area, to keep on commuting.  
 
The main reasons provided by respondents for migrating to their present community are: 
·
to find a job;  
·
to accompany family members; 
·
to gain new experience; 
·
calm area.  
 
It is observed however that most laborers prefer to commute to the farms in the area. 
Interviews show that a number of factors presently work as a disincentives for permanent 
migration: 
·
Living without family members
.
Social structure in traditional farming villages is 
strong and people are reluctant to leave these structures behind. 
·
Lack of social services / bakery. 
Table 2.1 provided in chapter 2.2.2 provides an 
overview of the present appreciation of social services in the villages surrounding the 
WDWCIRP area.  It is evident that much needs to be improved for people to be convinced 
that living conditions in these cities are inviting.  
·
Lack of security in house tenure
.
At present, this security is lacking in Sadat City 
where capacity is located. All residents interviewed complained that they do not hold an 
official house ownership contract. The residents are faced with progressive increases in the 
prices of houses, which is putting them more and more into debt, some of them stopped 
paying installments altogether. Apparently, the Sadat City administration body is not setting 
a
clear system for house tenure and this is causing a lot of confusion among residents and 
raises the houses speculation, making young married couples hesitant about moving. 
·
Benefit packages
.
Investors provide benefit packages in addition to salaries that include 
housing, transportation, sometimes meals or a combination of these. Housing or dormitories 
as the investors offer, makes workers decide against settling in the area as a family. In on- 
farm dormitories life is very cost effective. So whereas investors offer this benefit package 
to ensure that workers are available and arrive on time to work with no time loss, it 
encourages workers to commute on weekends instead of deciding to move with their 
families into the West Delta.  
·
Public transport
.
A
major constraint mentioned by workers and worth mentioning is the 
transportation. Workers hardly find transportation on weekends when they are going back to 
their hometowns. 
Page  44
44
·
Labor uncertainty
.
Another issue raised by laborers is the absence of permanent 
employment. A large proportion of the work is seasonal. Permanent jobs are not reliable as 
they depend on the relationship with the investors. Workers see themselves vulnerable to 
‘investors’ whims.  
Impact 3: Multiplier effect of new settlement: low 
Availability of surface water will act as the main driver for economic development in the 
region. Farms will need and utilize more laborers in the future since these farms will be fully 
planted (example Dina Farms are now planting 7000 out of 10,000 feddans). The total job 
creation will be significantly more than the labor force needed for the direct agricultural 
activities.  This will be realized as the interaction between agricultural and non-agricultural 
activities increases. Agribusinesses and farms (whether large or small) can be mutually 
supportive in the sense that farms will find immediate markets for their products and 
agribusinesses would find the quality produce for their high level of productivity. 
 
Figures provided by the DRAINFRAME study on the multiplier effect of agricultural 
development on population development are under the present conditions unrealistic. Since living 
conditions are not optimal most laborers prefer to commute. Settlement of people in the area 
would lead to an increase in construction activities, an increased demand for social and health 
services  (schools, clinics, sports, etc), and an increase in service-oriented activities (such as 
shops). As long as settlement conditions remain unfavorable this spin-off of the project cannot be 
fully benefited from.  
 
Unlike previous land reclamation programs, where land was assigned to small farmers and 
jobless graduates and most productive investment and social infrastructure were made by the 
state, the West Delta relies on large investors to develop the area and manage the project. It is 
worth noting here that this scenario has one of the following potential outcomes:  
·
Either, the result will be the creation of viable communities, visible only if the 
government takes concerted efforts to make the existing cities attractive enough to workers 
and employees to come and settle with their families,  
·
Or the result will be a series of dispersed, unplanned settlements and large numbers of 
commuters, if the government chooses not to invest in the area to sustain the expected 
economic boom. 
 
The present situation works at the detriment of the long term overall resettlement policy 
of Egypt. Therefore, a shared vision of the area by both government bodies and West Delta 
investors should be developed in order to maximally benefit of the opportunities offered in the 
area.  
5.5.2 Measures
Although it is easy to assert that the social impact of the West Delta project will be 
significant, yet it is difficult to forecast in what manner. The change will be led by the labor 
demand generated by the investors, and it will therefore be subject to the fluctuations of the 
market for agricultural products and to the strategic plans of the investors themselves more than 
the rationality of the government planning. This, however, should not mean that government 
planning for the area is irrelevant or not required. On the contrary, it means that government 
planning is indeed needed to go hand in hand with the economic investment in the West Delta. 
The present situation works at the detriment of the long term regional development policy of 
Egypt. Therefore, a shared vision of the area by both government bodies and West Delta investors 
should be developed in order to maximally benefit of the opportunities offered in the area. To 
Page  45
45
facilitate this process it is proposed to closely monitor the socio-economic development as the 
project becomes operational (
M.9
). 
 
It is extremely difficult to predict social changes resulting from a project of this nature. In 
view of this it is critical to establish a solid monitoring process. A first step would be the 
preparation of a baseline study which should focus on a limited set of key variables which could 
be monitored at regular intervals throughout the life of the project and beyond, such as the social 
changes in the project areas resulting from large-scale commute/migration. This process should 
also pay attention to the fact that the farmers in the project area vary from major agribusinesses to 
those growing less than 10 feddans. Although none of the farmers affected by the project are 
poor, their interests are likely to vary considerably, and it is important to ensure that all voices are 
heard. 
 
The social section of DRI has experience with such monitoring program, as they did 
already the baseline study during the DRAINFRAME study. The results of this program will be 
submitted to the Land Use Planning Authority, who is responsible for the integrated socio-
economic development of the rural areas.  
 
5.6 
Triggered safeguard policies 
5.6.1  Safeguards policy on involuntary resettlement
Bank experience indicates that involuntary resettlement under development projects, if 
unmitigated, often gives rise to severe economic, social, and environmental risks: production 
systems are dismantled; people face impoverishment when their productive assets or income 
sources are lost; people are relocated to environments where their productive skills may be less 
applicable and the competition for resources greater.  
 For 
these 
re
asons, the overall objectives of the World Bank’s policy on involuntary 
resettlement are the following: 
(a) 
Involuntary resettlement should be avoided where feasible, or minimized, exploring all 
viable alternative project designs. 
(b) 
Where it is not feasible to avoid resettlement, resettlement activities should be conceived 
and executed as sustainable development programs, providing sufficient investment 
resources to enable the persons displaced by the project to share in project benefits. 
Displaced persons should be meaningfully consulted and should have opportunities to 
participate in planning and implementing resettlement programs. 
(c) 
Displaced persons should be assisted in their efforts to improve their livelihoods and 
standards of living or at least to restore them, in real terms, to pre-displacement levels or to 
levels prevailing prior to the beginning of project implementation, whichever is higher. 
 
Some activities under the WDWCIRP may potentially trigger the safeguards policy as 
these may cause (a) the involuntary taking of land resulting in relocation or loss of shelter; (b) 
loss of assets or access to assets; or (c) loss of income sources or means of livelihood, whether or 
not the affected persons must move to another location.  
 
Because of the many technical and lay-out decisions that still have to be taken, it is in the 
present stage of project development difficult to assess the magnitude of involuntary resettlement 
issues to occur. Therefore, this section only provides an overview of  the impacts that can be 
expected, and the measures that can be taken. A separate Resettlement Policy Framework has 
been designed for WDWCIRP that provides guidance to the formulation of the final resettlement 
plans during the final design phase.  
Page  46
46
 
It is pertinent that the safeguards policy applies to other activities resulting in involuntary 
resettlement, that in the judgment of the Bank, are (a) directly and significantly related to the 
Bank-assisted project; (b) necessary to achieve its objectives as set forth in the project 
documents; and (c) carried out, or planned to be carried out, contemporaneously with the project.  
A) Alignment of pipe system and additional measures 
 
Based on earlier technical and environmental studies a choice has been made to convey all 
water within the project area by closed conduit. This avoids several of the earlier identified 
impacts. The DBO contractor will further optimize the design in order to avoid involuntary 
resettlement: 
·
Avoiding occupation of land by open canals and service roads. 
·
Avoiding spread of vector-borne diseases 
·
Minimizing the risk of illegal use of water. 
·
Reduced water pollution as open canals cannot be used as waste dump. 
·
Reduced seepage and evaporation losses. 
·
More flexibility to serve peaks in water demand. 
 
Yet, from the preliminary design in the technical study it becomes apparent that for the 
realization of the project some agricultural land will temporarily or permanently be needed.

·
Electricity supply
:
A
new transformer substation is needed to feed the intake 
pumping station and the intermediate boosters. 126 km of new power lines will be 
constructed. 
·
Mains
:
Fourteen mains serve the south zone with a total length of 154,5 km. Their 
diameters range between 2200 and 1200 mm. The number of parallel pipes for the carrier 
mains range from 6 (5 km) to 4 (16 km) to 2 (8 km). Some area is required for different 
valve chambers along the mains. These chambers are required for control valves at each 
main ends, air valves if required and drain valves.  
·
Sub-mains
:
250 km of PVC sub-mains further distribute water. Diameters rage from 
900mm at the start to 300mm at the end. 
·
Farm connections: 
about 920 km of 200 mm diameter PVC pipe bring water to the 
farm gates. 
·
Roads system
:
includes the improvement of the existing road system especially earth 
roads. This system is essential to reach all boosters and pump stations. A first degree road 
system 10.0 m width at least will connect the intakes, intermediate boosters and sub-main 
boosters. A second degree road system 6.0 m width at least will reach till the farm 
connections.  
 
Resettlement issues 
·
Expropriation.
 A
limited surface area needs to be expropriated for permanent 
use for main intake, pump house, 52 booster stations, and valve chambers.  
·
Compensation for temporary disturbance
.
During construction of pipelines 
lands will temporarily be put out of use for construction purposes. Obviously the 
construction of mains and sub-mains will have the biggest impact, simply because of the 
size of the pipes and the amount of earth works required to burry these. For example, the 
first 5 km of mains will include 6 parallel pipes of 2000mm diameter, buried at 1,5 m below 
the surface. This implies the removal of some 30 m3 of earth for each meter of pipeline.  
·
Rights-of-way:
 Land owners have to give rights-of-way for pipes to pass under 
their lands. All pressurized pipes within the project have a soil cover of 1.5 m at least to 
allow traffic load and even enough depth for agricultural activities. It is unclear what 
restrictions will apply to agricultural and other activities over the trajectory of the pipelines. 
·
Right of way also needs to be arranged for the crossing of power lines.  
·
Roads
.
As stated a network of roads is needed to service the pipeline 
infrastructure, from intake to farm connections. Very few public roads exist in the area (see 
map below, but many local private roads have been constructed. At the present stage of 
design it is impossible to provide any sensible comments on the adequacy of the existing 
road network and the demand posed by the project.. 
 
The involuntary character of the impacts created by the closed conduit system does to a 
certain extent not apply as many of the affected farmers in the West Delta area will also act as 
beneficiaries of the project. The major problem of course lies with those farmers not willing to 
connect to the surface water supply system, and consequently neither willing to accept any 
inconveniences caused by the project.  
 
Page  48
48
Figure 5.9 
Public roads in and around the project area
 
Measures: Avoidance, Mitigation, Compensation 
 
The first aim is to avoid involuntary resettlement issues through comparison of alternative 
technical design solutions 
(M.10). 
It has been suggested to situate the main pipelines as much as 
possible along existing public roads, to avoid
too much disturbance and expropriation of farm 
lands. From observations in the area it becomes clear that this may create new problems. For 
example along the Khatatba road many temporary and permanent structures have been raised 
which would hinder the construction of the pipelines. On the other hand, there are a great number 
of local dirt roads which could provide good opportunities for pipeline construction. It should 
however be observed that roads have not been constructed from a hydraulic point of view. An 
optimized, hydraulically efficient pipe system, partially based on gravity flow, does not 
necessarily coincide with the lay-out of roads. 
 
If avoidance is not entirely possible, the second aim should be mitigating (i.e. 
minimizing), in as far as possible, the effects of involuntary resettlement 
(M.11)
.
Mitigation 
should be attained, again through comparison of alternative designs, but also by cautious 
construction procedures and techniques. Farmers are allowed to cultivate their farms, even with 
embedded pipes. However, it can be imagined that some limitations apply to the cultivation of 
crops along the path of pipelines, for example for the cultivation of permanent crops (e.g. fruit 
trees) will be limited.  
 
If avoidance and mitigation fail, the final aim should be to compensate 
(M.12) 
the 
remaining damage. Specific implementation responsibilities have been outlined in the 
Environmental and Social Management Plan (Component V on Safeguard policies).  
 
B) Inundation of Rosetta Branch banks and islands. 
 
In Section 5.4.2, the changing hydrological characteristics of the Rosetta Branch under the 
WDWCIRP project, have been discussed. The maximum water level that will occur in the river as 
a
result of the projects, will be higher than today
’s normal flows. Since flooding disappeared the 
river banks and islands have been encroached, legally or illegally, by small holders for 
cultivation. One can also find buildings at places which erstwhile were not suitable for 
Page  49
49
construction. Depending on the rise of the water levels between Delta Barrage and the 
downstream supplementary pumping station, part of the land and buildings may get inundated 
and be lost. It will make significant difference whether one assesses the problem from the mere 
WDWCIRP point of view, or if one takes the entire West Delta Program into account. For the 
WDWCIRP, the Rosetta flow will increase maximally with 0.9 BCM/y, or about 25%. 
Potential resettlement issues 
·
Legally or illegally occupied land for agriculture along or in Rosetta Branch. 
·
Legal or illegal constructions like houses, ferry ramps and the like. 
Measures: Avoidance, Mitigation, Compensation 
 
The significance of the problem is unknown. An assessment study 
(M.4)
 on the changing 
river hydrology has been assigned to the Nile Research Institute to reveal the impacts. If the 
conclusions of this study dictate so, additional environmental/social management measures 
should be taken. 
5.6.2  Safeguards policy on Natural Habitats (OP 4.04)
The conservation of natural habitats, like other measures that protect and enhance the 
environment, is essential for long-term sustainable development. The Bank therefore supports the 
protection, maintenance, and rehabilitation of natural habitats and their functions in its economic 
and sector work, project financing, and policy dialogue. The Bank supports, and expects 
borrowers to apply, a precautionary approach to natural resource management to ensure 
opportunities for environmentally sustainable development. The Bank does not support projects 
that, in the Bank’s opinion, involve the significant conversion or degradation of critical natural 
habitats. 
 
The OP 4.04 defines natural habitats as land and water areas where (i) the ecosystems' 
biological communities are formed largely by native plant and animal species, and (ii) human 
activity has not essentially modified the area's primary ecological functions. Critical natural 
habitats are existing protected areas and areas officially proposed by governments as protected 
areas, areas initially recognized as protected by traditional local communities (e.g., sacred 
groves), and sites that maintain conditions vital for the viability of these protected areas (as 
determined by the environ-mental assessment process.  
 
Critical habitats potentially under influence of the project should be influenced by the 
three distinguished drivers of change: 
·
Hydrological changes in the Nile system caused by new water intake.  
·
Water supply to West Delta area and effects on groundwater aquifers. 
·
Induced development in the West Delta caused by economic incentives.  
 
Linked to the Nile system 
 
The following natural habitats are hydrologically linked to the Nile system: 
 
a) Internationally recognized: 
·
Lake Burullus - listed site under the Ramsar
4
Wetlands Convention. 
4
Convention on Wetlands of International Importance (RAMSAR), is an intergovernmental 
treaty adopted on 2 February 1971 in the Iranian city of Ramsar. Ramsar is the first of the modern 
global intergovernmental treaties on conservation and wise use of natural resources. Under the 
Convention there is a general obligation for the Contracting Parties to include wetland 
conservation considerations in their national land-use planning. They have undertaken to 
Page  50
50
 
b)
Recognized under Egyptian law: 
·
Lake Qarun 
–
protected area: artificial wetland created by drainage water from Fayoum 
valley 
·
Wadi el Rayan – conservation area: man-made drainage sink by-passing Lake Qarun. 
The situation is dynamic as drainage water inflow tends to decrease gradually, which 
eventually will lead to degradation of biodiversity values.  
 
To trigger the safeguards policy on natural habitats, the WDWCIR Project should lead to 
degradation of these areas, where degradation is defined as the modification of a critical or other 
natural habitat that substantially reduces the habitat's ability to maintain viable populations of its 
native species.  
 
As described in Section 5.4. a redistribution of water within the Nile system will be 
needed to allow the WDWCIRP project to operate within the available national water budget. The 
potential impact of reallocation without mitigation measure was estimated at 0.7% of the current 
allocations in the old lands. Consequently, the potential impact of the project on Lake Burullus 
and other coastal lakes is too small. The changes that the project will have on the redistribution of 
water may lead to minor changes in the drainage patterns in the Delta. However, there are many 
activities having a larger influence on the available amount and quality of drainage water. 
Irrigation improvement, water treatment facilities, groundwater pumping, and drainage water 
reuse all have marked effects on drainage flows. Consequently, it will be impossible to 
distinguish the effect of the WDWCIRP project within a situation where the autonomous 
development is so dynamic and heavily influenced by other activities, whose influence can not be 
established with certainty either. 
 
The protected wetland areas around Fayoum have been created by drainage outflows and 
are man-made. Their status fully depends on irrigation and drainage practices in Fayoum and 
hence will not be affected by the project.  
 
Conclusion: there are no reasons to assume the WDWCIRP project will significantly 
affect any critical natural habitats linked to the Nile system. 
 
Linked to aquifers in West Delta  
 
The area of influence is the aquifer used by conjunctive irrigation and receiving 
percolated water. Wadi El Natrun area is of particular interest, although it has no official status as 
Natural Habitat. The depression, lying in north-south direction has its own local aquifer which 
cuts through the Moghra aquifer and is hydraulically linked to it. Groundwater comes to the 
surface creating several lakes surrounded by salt resistant wetland vegetation on humid soils 
(solonchaks). Evaporation creates salt crusts on the soil. The open water body is endoreic 
(without outlet) and has rather big seasonal variations in water levels and levels of salinity 
depending on the balance between inflow and evaporation. The area has no formal protected 
status but it represents a unique landscape feature in the surrounding (partially reclaimed) desert 
area.  
 
In the North the depression is influenced by the groundwater mound under Nubariya and 
Bustan irrigation systems. In the South the groundwater levels reportedly are lowering due to 
extraction for irrigation in Wadi el Natrun and Wadi el Farigh areas. 
formulate and implement this planning so as to promote, as far as possible, "the wise use of 
wetlands in their territory".

Although the groundwater simulation model indicates a slow recovery of the groundwater 
situation in Wadi el Natrun caused by the WDWCIRP, it will be difficult to show a distinct 
impact of the project on Wadi el Natrun. Recent developments affecting the immediate 
surrounding of the lake include the growth of Wadi el Natrun City, creation of a formal industrial 
estate near Wadi el Natrun City, the establishment of aquaculture ponds around the lakes 
(particularly in the North), and further reclamation of lands for groundwater-based agriculture. 
Box 5.3: Wadi El Natrun
 
Wadi el Natrun is an elongate depression, about 50 km long, with an average width of 8 km, oriented from south-east to 
north-west and situated west of the Nile delta, c.90 km south of the Mediterranean. It contains a series of nine small lakes 
(total area over 200 km²), scattered along its general axis. The water in the lakes originates from two main sources: from 
seepage and from springs in the bottoms of some lakes. The Wadi el Natrun aquifer is a local aquifer consisting of Pliocene 
rocks. Its transmissivity is generally less than 500 m
2
/day. It is underlain by the Moghra formation (separated by a thin clay 
layer). The aquifer is in direct contact with the Nile aquifer system which is overlying it north of Wadi El Natrun. The 
aquifer is multi-layered, consisting of an alternation of sand and clay. As the depression cuts through the delta aquifer, 
lateral seepage is generally from the north-east, resulting in the creation of wet salt marshes on the north-eastern shores of 
the lakes while, in contrast, the southern and western shores are distinctly barren. Water in the lakes is hyper-saline, 
fluctuating seasonally according to the depth of the water-table. Typha swamps occur at localities along the shores of the 
lakes where there is a plentiful freshwater supply. Juncus and Cyperus dominate the wet salt marshes on the waterlogged 
eastern shores. The latter species carpets most of the marsh areas in a dense cover that does not exceed a few centimeters 
height because of severe grazing pressure. This, however, creates one of the most characteristic and attractive habitats for 
water birds in Wadi El Natrun. Mudflats and salt-encrusted sabkhas fringe parts of the lake’s shores. 
The area is designated as one of Egypt’s 34 important bird areas, although it has no formal protected status. Birdlife 
International provides detailed information on this5  
Wadi El Natrun is of modest importance for water birds. In winter 1989/90 a total of c.7,700 water birds was counted. Wadi 
El Natrun is known to hold some of the largest winter concentrations in Egypt of Tadorna tadorna (Shelduck), Gallinago 
gallinago (Common Snipe), Numenius arquata (Europan Curlew), Calidris minuta (Little Stint) and Charadrius alexandrinus 
(Kentish Plover). However, with the exception of the latter, none are known to occur in internationally significant numbers. 
The area is also of moderate importance for migrant water birds; in spring 1990 a total of c.7,800 waders was counted 
(including some resident species). The area might be more important for staging migrants during autumn. Grus grus 
(Common Crane) is known to pass through and rest in significant numbers during spring and autumn. Some 12 species of 
water birds are known or expected to breed in Wadi El Natrun, including the largest breeding population of Charadrius 
pecuarius (Ringed Plover) known in Egypt. Marmaronetta angustirostris (Marbled Teal – conservation status is vulnerable) 
previously bred in Wadi El Natrun, at least until 1912. There is no recent indication of breeding. The last observation of the 
species in Wadi El Natrun was in 1986 and it is unlikely that it will breed again unless disturbance and hunting pressure are 
curbed. 
Conservation issues: Land-claim and fish-farming are taking place in and around the lakes, transforming the wetlands. 
Rapidly expanding, groundwater-dependent agricultural projects, in and around Wadi El Natrun, are threatening to lower the 
water-table significantly. These will (if uncontrolled) eventually dry up the lakes of Wadi El Natrun. Increased grazing 
pressure and reed-cutting (for various domestic uses) are threatening the remaining reed-swamps with extermination. The 
growing population, along with an increase in tourism and industrial development, is leading to greater urbanization, 
pollution, disturbance and hunting pressure. 
Conclusion: effects of the project on Wadi el Natrun don't trigger the safeguards policy 
OP 4.04. 
 
Linked to induced development in the West Delta  
 
The project area is reclaimed desert area without any distinguished natural habitat.  
 Conclusion
:
Safeguards policy OP 4.04 on Natural Habitats is 
not
 triggered. 
5.6.3  Safeguards policy on Cultural Property
The project area of WDWCIRP is not known for antiquities. The empty area started to be 
reclaimed about 25 years ago. On the farms extensive digging took place to bury the on-farm

pipelines, without encountering archeological remnants. Because digging for the main pipelines 
of the project will go deeper, the chance to encounter anything archeologically valuable, although 
small, cannot be completely ruled out. 
 
The safeguard procedures of Egypt for protection of antiquities are clear, appropriate, and 
applicable for WDWCIRP. The general contract of the MWRI regulates this issue through its 
clause no. 25 which make contractors responsible for any antiquities during excavation both by 
calling for the High Council of Antiquities in the case they find any antiquity and by employing 
and paying for the technicians of the Council during the period of work 
(M.13)
.
Known antiquities in the surroundings of the project area are limited to the ancient Copt 
monasteries in Wadi el Natrun. The monk communities of these monasteries suffered from 
declining groundwater tables 
(Drainframe 2005)
.
It is expected that the groundwater levels in the 
course of time will reestablish themselves due to the project (see Section 5.5). Hence, it is not 
expected that the safeguard policy on Cultural Property will be triggered on this item. 
5.6.4  Safeguard policy on pest management (OP 4.09)
In assisting borrowers to manage pests that affect either agriculture or public health, the 
Bank supports a strategy that promotes the use of biological or environmental control methods 
and reduces reliance on synthetic chemical pesticides. In Bank-financed projects, the borrower 
addresses pest management issues in the context of the project’s environmental assessment.  
 
OP 4.09 applies to all Bank lending, whether or not the loan finances pesticides. Even if 
Bank lending for pesticides is not involved, an agricultural development project may lead to 
substantially increased pesticide use and subsequent environmental problems. 
 
In Bank-financed agriculture operations, pest populations are normally controlled through 
IPM approaches, such as biological control, cultural practices, and the development and use of 
crop varieties that are resistant or tolerant to pests. 
 
IPM refers to a mix of farmer-driven, ecologically based pest control practices that seeks 
to reduce reliance on synthetic chemical pesticides. It involves (a) managing pests (keeping them 
below economically damaging levels) rather than seeking to eradicate them; (b) relying, to the 
extent possible, on non-chemical measures to keep pest populations low; and (c) selecting and 
applying pesticides, when they have to be used, in a way that minimizes adverse effects on 
beneficial organisms, humans, and the environment. 
 
The following criteria apply to the selection and use of pesticides in Bank-financed 
projects:  
·
They must have negligible adverse human health effects. 
·
They must be shown to be effective against the target species. 
·
They must have minimal effect on non-target species and the natural 
environment. The methods, timing, and frequency of pesticide application are aimed to 
minimize damage to natural enemies.  
·
Their use must take into account the need to prevent the development of 
resistance in pests. 
 
With respect to the project it can be argued that the project is not an agricultural project 
since the project only aims to replace groundwater by surface water for existing agricultural 
activities. However, it is a stated intention of the project to expand agricultural practices on non-
cultivated land. This triggers the pest management policy. The specific risk associated to the use 
of pesticides is the vulnerability of the area and groundwater. In the West Delta area the sandy, 
highly permeable soils, provide a relatively open connection to the groundwater unless restricting 
soil layers exist above the water bearing strata.  
Page  53
53
 
An approach for assessing the risk of the use of pesticides on groundwater is pollution 
risk mapping.  Pollution risk maps are the product of combining two land surface zonation maps 
namely: pollution type and load or threat, and the intrinsic vulnerability map.  In this context, 
mapping the different categories of pollutants threats, i.e. industrial, agricultural and domestic is 
needed. 
 
The first map has been made for the Nile delta area, a relatively large scale exercise. 
Nevertheless, Figure 5.5 shows that the project area is almost completely located in a zone 
considered to have a moderate intrinsic risk; in other words, the soils themselves provide little 
protection mechanism to stop pollutants from reaching the groundwater.  
 
A pollution risk map has not yet been made for the West Delta region. This should be part 
of the environmental management plan for which the Groundwater Sector has special 
responsibility and the technical capacity (See Section 2.3 of the ESMP). 
 
The only available natural protection mechanism is the depth at which groundwater is 
found. Before reaching the water, pollutants have to travel through well aerated, thick layers of 
sandy soil of more than 50 meters. In the case of degradable pesticides, these will be degraded 
under the influence of oxygen before the substances reach the groundwater. A measure to reduce 
pollution risk by agriculture consequently is the use of modern, biodegradable pesticides, such as 
the ones prescribed under the EurepGAP certification protocol.  
 
Many growers in the project area producing for the European export market produce 
under this certification scheme. They could serve as training centers for other farmers to learn to 
use the appropriate plant protection measures. 
 
The EurepGAP standards for certification of growers, and the strict monitoring and 
application practices are in compliance with the World Bank standard for IPM. Moreover, the 
Good Agricultural Practice protocol also incorporates standards for fertilizer management and 
social standards for laborers.  
 
As a mitigating measure, it is proposed to incorporate integrated pest management in the 
sustainable groundwater management plan (Section 5.4.5). 
Page  54

E
UREPGAP, including retailers, suppliers/growers and associate members from the input and service side of 
agriculture was established in 1997 as an initiative of retailers belonging to the Euro-Retailer Produce 
Working Group (EUREP). It aims to agree on standards and procedures for development of good agricultural 
practice (GAP) and is based on Integrated Crop Management. Activities include a certification scheme and 
harmonization of standards for IPM and minimized pesticide use. The EUREPGAP certificate is a business-to-
business scheme, which is used in the production chain and not intended as a label for consumers. 
The EurepGap protocol applies the following definitions in pest management:  
·
Integrated pest control
:
The rational application of a combination of biological, biotechnical, chemical, 
cultural or plant-breeding measures whereby the use of chemical plant protection products is limited to 
the strict minimum necessary to maintain the pest population at levels below those causing 
economically unacceptable damage or loss.
 
·
Integrated Pest Management (IPM):
The careful consideration of all available pest control techniques 
and subsequent integration of appropriate measures that discourage the development of pest populations 
and keep plant protection products and other interventions to levels that are economically justified and 
reduce or minimize risks to human health and the environment. IPM emphasizes the growth of a 
healthy crop with the least possible disruption to agro-ecosystems and encourages natural and or non-
chemical pest control mechanisms.

Mar07_010307.pdf
IPM and fertilizer management as part of EurepGAP has been included in the package of 
measures that protect groundwater quality and forms part of the Sustainable Groundwater 
Management Plan (
M.7
). The objective is to introduce the good practices of the majority of the 
farmers to those who are lagging behind in this regard. 
 
5.7 
System Construction 
Discussion
The project area is predominantly used for agriculture. As it is virtually uninhabited the 
construction related impacts will not have any significant human health consequences, nor will 
these affect the living conditions of inhabitants. Nevertheless, a number of issues require 
attention. As repeatedly stated, a precise technical design and layout of the project are not known 
yet. Consequently, this section will only provide an overview of issues which need to be 
addressed in a detailed ESMP to be produced by the proponent. 
Crossings
The planned delivery and distribution system has several crossings with the SOMID crude 
oil pipeline, the Cairo 
–
Alexandria Railway (Supplementary Supply Canal) and the Cairo-
Alexandria Desert road.  
 
It includes the necessary main structures required where the proposed mains and sub-
mains cross existing roads, SOMID pipeline or any other obstacles. Other minor crossings are not 
included in this overview. The crossing structures are listed below: 
 
Culverts for main pipelines  
·
under Cairo Alexandria Desert Road at kilo 9 on Main 03 
·
under SOMID oil pipeline at kilo 15 on Main 03. 
·
under Cairo-Alexandria Desert Road at kilo 17 on Main 04. 
·
under SOMID pipeline at kilo 21 on Main 04. 
·
under SOMID pipe line at kilo 6 on Main 10. 
·
under SOMID pipe line at kilo 0 on Main 12. 
Page  55
55
·
under a main asphalted road at kilo 5.5 on Main 18. 
 
This is the information from the preliminary design of the technical study; the final design 
may have a different lay-out.  
 
If crossings can be made by hydraulic jacking, the disturbance will be kept to a minimum. 
However, the Desert Highway is a large obstacle for which it may not be possible to use this 
technology, especially when pipes of large diameters have to be jacked.  
 
The proponent will have to indicate how this crossing will be made, causing as little 
obstruction as possible to this strategic corridor.  
 
(N.B: the Desert Highway will in the near future be upgraded to a four-laned motorway; 
opportunities to combine construction activities may be explored). 
Construction Impacts
During construction activities various activities may cause local environmental impacts. 
These include:  
·
Site preparation and or leveling: dust and particulate emissions. 
·
Excavation of materials and production of spoil. 
·
Performing construction activities such concrete works, metal works, masonry works, 
and or electro-mechanical activities.  
·
Mobilization and use of heavy construction equipment: heavy duty transport. 
·
Transport of construction materials and supplies: generation of solid waste. 
 
There are mainly four common outcomes of the construction process that would 
potentially impact the environment.   
·
Dust and Particulate Emissions
:
especially during the process of excavations and fill 
using heavy construction machinery, but also from the storage of piles of free flowing 
materials in open spaces such as sand and excavated material piles.  Although such 
phenomena are temporary in nature, they may affect nearby agricultural lands. This process 
of air borne dust and particulate emissions may have environmental health dimensions 
(particularly to those individuals with respiratory problems), but since he area is virtually 
uninhabited this is not an issue of great importance. 
·
Creation of Spoil
.
Excavation will result in the creation of certain amounts of spoil 
which have to be dealt with in such a manner that it doe
sn’t harm agricultural activities in 
the area. 
·
Construction Waste
:
is a typical by-product of the construction process and may include 
concrete waste, masonry waste, plastics, paper, metals, wood …etc.  Depending on the 
scope and location of the site specific project in question the generated construction waste 
contributes to the solid waste.   
·
Material Transport
:
during the construction process various types of material will be 
transported to the construction sites. This transport will be performed by heavy duty 
vehicles that need to pass through small rural roads, potentially leading to damage.  
Page  56
56
Measures 
 
Appropriate construction management practices are required to avoid these impacts to 
occur. Good construction practices would mitigate most of these temporary impacts to acceptable 
levels. Dangerous activities in public areas will be controlled to reduce risk to the public, traffic 
and warning signs will be placed at construction sites, trenches will be provided by fences, or 
railings. The construction contract document will incorporate all requirements to minimize 
disturbance from construction activities. It will be monitored by the Environmental Specialist at 
the PMU to ensure compliance and implementation of the required provisions by the Contractor. 
Such measures (
M.14
)
will be indicated in a Clean and Safe Construction Plan as part of the 
ESMP made by the proponent. The MWRI's approval of this plan is a prerequisite.

6. Synthesis 
 
This chapter in table 6.1 summarizes for the three main drivers of change the main 
physical effects of the project, the immediate measures, the effects of the immediate measures 
(second order effects) their impacts and the response to it by taking second order remedial 
measures. 
 
For the triggered Safeguard Policies and the Construction of the system, a more straight 
forwarded summary of the avoiding, mitigating and compensating measures is given.

PART II: Environmental and Social Management Plan: a 
framework 
1. Introduction 
 
In Part I of this report the (potential) environmental and social impacts have been assessed 
and possible avoiding, mitigating and compensating measures have been analyzed and listed.  
 
The ESMP is in part a framework at this juncture, for the following reasons 
(i) 
Some of the specific elements relating to the DBO contractor will be defined through 
a
detailed ESMP once the final design and alignment of the pipeline has been 
determined. 
(ii) 
Some specific impacts and their mitigation measures (e.g. water quality/sanitation; 
hydrology of Rosetta Branch) will be determined through detailed follow-on studies 
and assessments or through ongoing assessments. 
(iii) 
Some proposed mitigation measures are beyond the sole decision of the project, 
especially those relating to the NWRP (e.g. relating to prioritization of areas for water 
savings, sanitation programs).  
 
This Environmental and Social Management Plan provides a road map for further project 
preparation and implementation. A number of potential impacts can still be avoided if the final 
project design is adapted and if some institutional measures are taken before the start of the 
project's operational phase. Parts of the ESMP are already being executed pro-actively.  
 
It is the role of the PMU and Regulatory Office to ensure that these aspects are followed 
through effectively and with continued rigor.
 
Overall, the measures of the ESMP (summarized in Table 2) are grouped in seven 
components which refer to the six main impact themes as discussed above and a general 
component. 
I) 
Safe main Nile system management plan; 
II) 
Safe water quality for Nubariya Canal; 
III) 
Sustainable groundwater management plan; 
IV) 
Social development plan; 
V) 
Safeguards implementation plan; 
VI) 
Clean and safe construction plan; 
VII) 
General support to PMU and Regulatory Office. 
 
Chapter 2 describes for each ESMP component the single remedial measures and actions 
to be taken, the executive bodies and the supervising agency, the capacity building and 
monitoring components if relevant, and the financial requirements. Table 1 gives an overview of 
the measures. This information is consolidated in separate chapters on Monitoring (Chapter 3), 
Capacity Building (Chapter 4), an Institutional Chapter 5 and a Financial Chapter 6. 
Page  61

2. 
Description of the ESMP components 
 
All measures described below will be taken or already have been taken by MWRI and as a 
specific task assigned to the relevant departments and sectors. An indicative time schedule is 
included in Table 2. 
 
2.1 
Component I: Safe main Nile system management plan# 
 
These measures, which will seek to ensure adequate supply through the Nile, will include, 
among others, the following: (a) under the NWRP project the water balance of the Nile system 
will be monitored closely to assess availability of water and implementation of water saving 
measures for the horizontal expansion plans including the project areat. The WDWCIRP project 
management will, as an input in the NWRP process, identify specific water saving measures 
which relate to the project 
(M.1)
); (b) the promotion of scaling-up within the old lands, as a 
priority, the successful results of the Bank-financed IIIMP project which has demonstrated the 
viability of achieving the dual benefits of water savings and improving productivity water 
(M.2A)
;
(c) get project area prioritized and targeted for water saving measures by GOE, by 
seeking a direct reference to the WDWCIRP area within the official documentation pertaining of 
the  Horizontal Expansion Program 
(M.2B)
;
and to ensure adequate water supply through the 
Nile systems, and avoid constraints or shortfall, the DBO contractor and the attached service 
standards will specify that the operator has to provide the MWRI the monthly water requirements 
for the upcoming year (
M.3
). That will be followed with his daily requirements to be submitted 
10 days before the beginning of each month. This will enable the MWRI to adjust its operational 
planning for water distribution in time to ensure adequate water supplies for the project and rest 
of the system.  
Measure 1 
Identify specific water saving measures and provide concrete input to the 
NWRP process.  
Discussion:
 Implementation of the National Water Resources Plan under a new Water Policy: 
Water for the Future
 is being finalized
6
.
The strategic National Water Resources 
Plan aims to prioritize a large number of water saving and quality improving 
measures for implementation. The NWRP is therefore the most important planning 
mechanism for a "Safe main Nile system management". If the measures of the 
NWRP that have been started already are successfully implemented in addition to 
available water due to agricultural land loss to urbanization, savings of water in the 
Nile system will be sufficient to make up for the water requirements of the project. 
Moreover, the Implementation Support Project for NWRP, has recently been 
approved by both MWRI and the Government of the Netherlands and will most 
likely become operational within a year.  
 
The measures (such as restriction of rice and banana cultivation; treatment of 
Rahawi drain; IIIMP extensions; Rural sanitation projects; etc.) are beyond the reach 
of an ESMP of a single project. However, projects like WDWCIRP will help to set 
priorities in the implementation of the NWRP. The PMU of the WDWCIRP will be 
6

–
including the West Delta Irrigation 
Improvement Project.  
Page  62
62
the responsible party to work with other MWRI entities to provide the input to the 
NWRP. 
Actions:
 
1) In addition to other savings due to agricultural land use conversion, identify and 
assess potential water saving projects with direct bearing on WDWCIRP and 
introduce theme to NWRP process. 
 
2) Monitoring of the water balance of the Nile system; 
Monitoring program:
 action 2) is a regular task of the Central Administration for Water 
Distribution. 
Capacity Building:
 The Implementation Support Project to NWRP includes relevant capacity 
building components. 
Executive responsibility:
 The Central Administration for Water Distribution and the PMU in a 
coordinating and implementation role. 
Supervision:
 The supervision role is assigned to HEPS 
Timing:
 
As soon as NWRP ISP becomes effective.  
Financing:
  The total cost (during all WDWCIRP phases) is an estimated US$ 150,000. 
 
Measure 2 
Assure adequate water throughout the Nile system 
Measure 2A
 Scaling-up water saving measures within the old lands based on the results of 
IIIMP. 
Discussion:
 The Government has committed itself to a concession of Nile water for the 
WDWCIRP. Mitigation of negative impacts of the withdrawal of water from the 
Nile for this project is therefore the responsibility of the Government and not of the 
DBO contractor. The MWRI is the competent authority. The proposed measures are 
based on the stand-still and precautionary principles as defined in the National 
Water Policy 2017. As a precautionary principle the Policy also states: 
"New plans 
for horizontal expansion of agricultural area will be made dependent on further 
water saving measures or the availability of additional water resources".
 
Actions:
 
The promotion of scaling-up within the old lands, as a priority in the NWRP 
implementation, the successful results of the Bank-financed IIIMP project which has 
demonstrated the viability of achieving the dual benefits of water savings and 
improving productivity water. 
Monitoring:
 An extensive monitoring program including water saving performance is conducted 
under the IIP and IIIMP projects. 
Capacity Building:
 not
applicable. 
Executive responsibility:
 Irrigation Improvement Sector. 
Supervision:
 
MWRI 
Timing:
 Ongoing 
Financing:
 
not applicable 
 
Measure 2B
 Seeking direct reference to the WDWCIRP area within the official 
documentation on the Horizontal Expansion Program. 
Discussion:
 The Horizontal Expansion Program aims to develop 1.42 million hectares outside 
the Nile Valley and Delta as new agricultural land. Projects that are recognized for 
this program can be assigned water in line with official agreed policies. During the 
study no reference could be made on this to an official document. 
Page  63
63
Actions:
 
MWRI will confirm in writing that the WDWCIRP project is part of the Horizontal 
Expansion Program. 
Monitoring:
 not
applicable 
Capacity Building:
 not
applicable. 
Executive responsibility:
 Horizontal Expansion Projects Sector of MWRI. 
Supervision:
 
MWRI/PMU 
Timing:
 
Before loan negotiations. 
Financing:
 
not applicable 
 
Measure 3 
Guard against constraints and shortfall in water supply. 
Discussion:
 When for the WDWCIRP project pumping starts from the Rayah el Nasseri, the 
downstream command areas of this canal would suffer from serious water shortages 
without complementary measures. It is planned to refill the Rayah el Nasseri with 
water from the Rosetta Branch. To prevent concentrated water shortages in the 
service areas of the Rosetta Branch, the next step is to direct additional water from 
Delta Barrage to the Rosetta Branch. To avoid any chance on mistakes in the water 
management system timely planning for the new situation should be made. 
Actions:
 
1) A revised Annual Hydraulic Plan which takes the new project water needs into 
account. 
 
2) An ex-ante operational plan showing in some detail that the main control 
structures of the Nile system will be reset timely. 
Monitoring
:
No specific monitoring program needed. Water distribution will be monitored under 
the regular monitoring program of the CAWD 
Capacity Building:
 not applicable 
Executive responsibility:
 
action 1) The CAWD is responsible to prepare the Annual Hydraulic 
Plan for approval by HE the Minister. The DBO contractor should prepare annually

water allocation request and submit it to the MWRI. 
 
action 2) The DBO contractor will notify every 10 days the water needs he has 
(within his concessional right) for the next period to the General Directorate of 
Water Distribution of MWRI. The CAWD adjusts its 10-day operational plan

Measure 4 
Mitigation of impacts of hydrological changes of Rosetta Branch 
Discussion:
 Assuming the discharge of the Rosetta Branch will increase substantially, it may be 
expected that water levels will rise and erosion/sedimentation patterns will change. 
This may affect people who in one way or another make use of the banks of the 
river. Because such assessment is beyond the possibilities of this ESIA, a special 
study is proposed. 
Actions:
 
1) An additional assessment of hydrological changes of Rosetta Branch and their 
impacts. This study has been launched already by HEPS to be carried out by the Nile 
Research Institute of the NWRC. Results will be available by the end of March 
2007. 
Page  64

2) An addendum to the EMP should be produced by NRI if potential impacts dictate 
so. This relates among others to compensation for those who are negatively affected 
by the rise of water level in Rosetta Branch, according Egyptian Law. The 
Resettlement Policy Framework for WDWCIRP provides the necessary procedures. 
 
3) Ex post monitoring of hydrological and morphological changes along Rosetta 
Branch. This monitoring component can be part of the existing monitoring efforts of 
MWRI. Extra attention is required during the first couple of years after the increased 
discharges appear.

Component II: Safe water quality for Nubariya Canal 
Measure 5 
Water quality assessment study
 
Discussion:
 Relatively clean water of the Rayah el Nasseri will be used for WDWCIRP. This 
water will be replaced downstream of the off-take with water of lower quality, 
which is pumped from the Rosetta Branch. The hydrological and water quality 
situation is too complex to allow for a quick assessment during the present ESIA. 
Hence a water quality assessment study is required. The study should be regarded a 
more rigorous follow-up activity to an earlier prioritization assessment and will 
comprise both data collection and modeling of impacts of different scenarios with 
the aim of inclusion of measures in the NWRP. 
Actions:
 
1)
 
A
water quality assessment should be conducted further to the study already 
finalized by DRI 
(2006)
 for the Umum Re-use Project and taking its results into 
account. This study should predict selected water quality parameters in the main 
water conveyance system of the West Delta Region. It seems logic to assign this 
study to DRI. Annex VII includes the study proposal. 
 
2) A water quality monitoring program in the region is already part of the regular 
water monitoring program of the WQMU of MWRI. The monitoring program 
should be reviewed (based on the findings of the water quality assessment study) 
and may be intensified (more measuring points and a broader spectrum of 
pollutants) during the first years of the new hydrological situation. 
Monitoring program:
 see action 2.  
Capacity Building:
 
There is a need with DRI for more advanced software to simulate the 
hydrology of the region, including the behavior of pollutants. Consultancy services 
will be required to make staff of DRI acquainted with this software, and its practical 
applications in the setting at hand.

Component III: Sustainable groundwater management plan 
Measure 7 
An integrated and sustainable groundwater management system  
Discussion:
 It may be attractive for farmers in the WDWCIRP area to continue, to some extent, 
the use of groundwater. The wells and infrastructure are in place, the water is (in 
most cases) still there, the bacteriological quality of the groundwater is better than of 
the surface water, the farm economic cost of surface water may be higher than of 
groundwater. A variety of management instruments can be thought of to control the 
pumping of groundwater and therefore the depletion of the aquifer and of 
deterioration of the water quality.  
 
Cropping pattern restrictions 
 
The peak water requirement in the area occurs in the 4 months May, June July and 
August. The surface water supply system will not have enough capacity to deliver 
all required water. Farmers who want to go for a year round 100% cultivation will 
use their existing and still functioning wells to make up for the difference. Model 
calculations show that leaving a portion of 15-20% of the total cultivable area 
uncultivated in summer will be enough to make groundwater use superfluous. The 
same area still can be used for other crops during the remaining 8 months of the 
year. 
 
Regulation of irrigation technology
 
Irrigation efficiency depends highly on the type of irrigation technology that is 
applied. Most farmers already use modern drip lines in their orchards and certain 
vegetable cropping, whereas sprinkler systems are used in broadly sown field crops. 
The measure aims to convert all farmers in the project area to these modern 
irrigation techniques. 
 
Legal restrictions of groundwater extraction 
 
Law 12 ensures application of licensing of new wells by water users. Licensing of 
new wells depends on the state of the groundwater. 
Page  66
66
 
Open storage of Nile Water. 
 
Another possibility is to construct surface storage reservoirs to store surplus water 
during the winter months, to make it available during the summer months, provided 
that water allocation is not exceeded. The capacity needed would be 600m3/feddan 
at the maximum, depending on other measures taken to decrease peak water 
requirements. The DRAINFRAME analysis makes a preliminary calculation of the 
breakeven cost of the construction of an earth bank reservoir. The local topography 
is an important factor in the cost calculations. Detailed calculations per individual 
farm are needed to prove the feasibility of this option. Of course the area of the 
reservoir will be lost for agriculture. 
 
The option would become more interesting if the reservoirs could be made 
productive, e.g. for aquaculture. The Keram integrated farm in Bustan is a successful 
example in this regard. 
 
Artificial recharge of aquifers 
 
Alternative ideas to use the aquifer to store surface water during the lean period for 
use during the peak season may be considered, provoking extra aquifer recharge 
during the winter months, provided that recharge is technically feasible and the 
yearly water allocation is not exceeded. In that case the aquifer is used as an over-
season underground storage facility. The disadvantage is the cost resulting from 
keeping two water supply systems operational. This also triggers discussion about 
who will pay for the aquifer recharge and who will benefit. 
 
The water quality of the groundwater in the project area is already deteriorating. To 
prevent further degeneration the following three measures are proposed. 
 
Integrated pest management 
 
Integrated pest management is a package of practices in itself which results in lower 
agrochemical residues on the produce and also in less dangerous contamination of 
the soil and finally the groundwater. Substantial number of  farmers are certified to 
produce under the EurepGAP protocol. This means that they already follow 
Integrated Pest Management methods and wise use of fertilizers. The aim is to bring 
all farmers to these practices 
 Fertilizer 
management 
 
Overdoses of fertilizers generally result in eutrophication of the groundwater. 
Nitrates and phosphates are notorious. The fertilizer filler may contribute to 
alkalinization of the soil and groundwater. The EurepGAP protocol also includes 
wise use of fertilizers. The aim is to bring all farmers to this wise use. 
 
Treatment of domestic and industrial sewage water 
 
Except for Sadat City, no waste water treatment plants are installed. Now that the 
economic and social activities in the area will intensify because of the spin-off of the 
project, pollution of the groundwater by the scattered domestic and agro-industrial 
sources of pollution may increase. 
Actions:
 
1) It is proposed that the above instruments, which may control the groundwater 
quantity and quality to sustainable levels, will be developed in an integrated 
package, while taking the following guidelines into account:   
·
There will be no total prohibition of groundwater extraction; 
Page  67
67
·
Groundwater extraction that takes place will be monitored; 
·
Enforcement of licensing of new wells; 
·
The right and amount to pump water is subject to license; 
·
The amount of groundwater a farmer is entitled to, should be made dependent on 
measures he has taken to save groundwater, like artificial recharge, irrigation 
technology in use, reduction of peak water requirement; 
·
Groundwater can always be used in case of emergency, i.e. if no surface water is 
available (groundwater as a back-up asset); 
·
Free riders (farmers not willing to connect) will get a license for groundwater as 
well but only to the amount they are used to; hence no new wells. Strict 
monitoring/policing should be applied here. 
 
2) The responsibility for groundwater management should be shared between the 
Groundwater Sector of the MWRI and the Water Users Council, an association of 
farmers-investors, with well specified complementary roles and responsibilities. The 
WUC has been established already, but it needs to be strengthened in all its duties 
(Box 1). The responsibility for WUC development lies with the Central Directorate 
Irrigation Advisory Services (CD-IAS) of MWRI. 
 
Box 1 Formal duties of WUO in WDWCIRP (Annex X) 
1) 
Approval of layout and designs for the whole project. However, DWBs and WUAs will be 
responsible for the lower levels.  
2) 
Participate in formulation of systems related to financing and water management 
(including regulations on the water resources management, e.g. conjunctive use); 
3) 
Development of internal regulations and procedures; 
4) 
Ensuring equity in water availability and risks sharing; 
5) 
Settling of conflicts and disputes between users, on one hand, and between the users, the 
ministries and the operators; 
6) 
Participate in setting and monitoring service standards; 
7) 
Participate in setting tariffs for late entrants;  
8) 
Participate in setting regulations for ownership of assets; and  
The duties of the WUC should be extended with the (shared) responsibility for the 
groundwater management plan. 
 
Monitoring program:
 The WUC will monitor the groundwater use and report to the GWS (self 
monitoring of wells). 
Capacity Building:
 CD-IAS will need strengthening to implement action 2, as the nature of this 
WUC is largely different from the classic WUOs in the Old Land. 
Executive responsibility:
 ad action 1) The WUC albeit with a temporary status has been 
established recently by Ministerial Decree. The membership of the WUC should be 
made obligatory for those farmers who connect to the surface water system 
 
Of course the sustainable groundwater management plan can not be introduced 
overnight. It is a model to which neither the Groundwater Sector nor the WUC are 
used to, and probably lack the capacity at this moment in time. 
 
Hence it is proposed to follow a process approach in developing this management 
system (read Box 2). 
Page  68
68
Box 2 The Process Approach 
Given the complex nature of the project area, including the variability of activities, the nature 
of the water resources (presently only groundwater becoming either totally surface water 
and/or a combination of both), the variability in land ownerships, the multitude of actors and 
interests involved and the stage of development, a “
Process Ap
proach”
 
will be adopted to 
achieve the objectives and outputs, as follows: 
·
Division of the project area into (more or less) homogeneous sub-regions, based on both the 
present distribution of well fields and the preliminary layout and design of branch canals and 
intakes/outlets. About 3-4 sub-regions (one for each branch/main intake) are foreseen at this 
stage; but could be modified after consultation with the farming community in the project area.
·
Nomination of an initiative group, about 8 to 15. These will represent the various types of 
present development (activities) as well as the various categories of ownership.  This means 
that the process will be a top-down rather than bottom-up. The main reason is to facilitate the 
agreement upon the initial design of the new water management system and to ensure an early 
start of the project. 
·
This so-called initiative group can be considered the initial Water Union (WU) and will be 
responsible for (under the monitoring/facilitation of the MWRI officials): 
1. 
Attending the first meeting at the MWRI to ensure a proper planning of the next steps; 
2. 
Informing the other users in their respective commands about the project and the 
approach followed and seek their support for the next steps; 
3. 
Giving their first opinions about the primary layout and arrangements of the project; and
4. 
Forming the final WU, Water Boards (WBs) on the sub-basins levels and Water Users 
Associations (WUAs) on turn outs/intakes (lower level representation).  
·
At a later stage, this group will vanish, giving place to bottom-up elections. 
How the groundwater management plan will exactly look like (given the guidelines 
outlined above, should be left to the participatory process that should take place 
between WUC, GS and CD-IAS as facilitating partner.

the WUC.

Measure 8 
Intensify groundwater monitoring 
Discussion
:
Groundwater monitoring is part of the groundwater management responsibility. 
Monitoring is carried out regularly by both the Research Institute for Groundwater 
and the Groundwater Sector of the MWRI. The periodic monitoring program covers: 
a. groundwater levels (piezometric heads); 
b.groundwater quality; and 
c. extractions. 
 
Results of all these activities are used to update the data base and potential maps of 
groundwater; which are the bases for licensing new wells and/or assessing pollution 
sources. A pollution risk map for the project concession area will be derived from 
the data.

cost of sampling program (sample taking and analyses to cover a package of 
constituents, including pesticide residues, nitrates and bacteriological components) 
will cost US$330,000. Total: US$ 360,000. 
2.4 
Component IV: Social development plan 
Discussion:
 Socio-economic changes in the area will be led by the labor demand generated by 
the investors; government planning is needed to go hand in hand with the economic 
investment in the West Delta. Additional economic spin-off can be expected in the 
supply of goods and services for agriculture as well as processing industries for raw 
products.  Such spin-offs can only be exploited to its full potential when sufficient 
labor is available, with sufficient level of education.  
 
Based on information obtained from the field, it is strongly recommended that an 
integrated socio-economic development plan for the project region (and beyond) 
will be put on the national development agenda. Development of an integrated plan 
for the West Delta region, comparable to a National Water Resources Plan, would 
be an opportunity (rather than an environmental risk) for sustainable socio-economic 
development of the region. This is beyond the reach and responsibility of the 
project. However, it is considered important to monitor on a yearly basis the social 
and economic development after the project has become operational and submit the 
findings to the Land Use Planning Authority. 
Measure 9 
Social monitoring program 
Actions:
 
A baseline study should be conducted as soon as practically possible, followed by 
regular (annual) monitoring program of the main indicators of change. It is critical to 
avoid an overly complex exercise. The baseline study, on which subsequent 
monitoring will build, should focus on a few monitorable variables. As highlighted 
in the SIA the interests of the farmers in the project area vary, and the monitoring 
process should focus on how the project affects both big and small farmers. The 
social impacts of the project both on the workforce and the local communities 
should be monitored. (see Section 3 for a tentative list of socio-economic 
parameters). This baseline study and monitoring program will be done by the 
Drainage Research Institute, which has experience in the area and with the subject. 
The results preferably are submitted to the Land Use Planning Authority which can 
take the initiative to start integrated planning for the region. 
 
The socio-economic section of DRI has conducted a study on these subjects during 
the DRAINFRAME assessment and this institute can be assigned the task for a 
number of years, starting with a baseline assessment. Annex VIII presents a proposal 
for a follow-up study and monitoring program. 
Supervision:
 The PMU will review the ToR for the monitoring program, and follow
–up
during 
the various stages of implementation. 
Timing: 
The baseline study should be conducted one year before the project becomes 
operational; regular monitoring thereafter on an annual basis. 
Financing:
 
Cost of baseline study and annual monitoring program: US$ 55,000

Component V: Safeguard policies 
2.5.1 Involuntary 
resettlement
Measure 10 
Avoidance of involuntary resettlement 
Discussion:
 In this section, a policy framework and operational procedures for an ESMP are 
provided, based on the detailed Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) prepared in a 
separate volume. Annex IX presents more detail, o.a  gaps between Egyptian laws 
and the World Bank safeguards policy; extensive legal and institutional background; 
various laws and legislation managing the issue of expropriation for public interest; 
operational procedures stated within Egyptian law that should be followed during 
the expropriation process and methods of estimating compensation. The policy may 
be triggered in two occasions: 1) the construction of the pipeline networks in the 
WDWCIRP area; and 2) land and buildings along the Rosetta Branch, depending on 
the extent of hydrological changes.  
Actions:
 
1) The DBO contractor will optimize his design of the pipeline alignments for the 
least expropriation impact. 
 
2) The NRI will produce an addendum to the ESMP in case the study on the Rosetta 
Branch reveals involuntary resettlement policy is triggered (see Measure 3)

Measure 11 
Mitigation of involuntary resettlement 
Discussion:
 Mitigating measures for involuntary resettlement is mainly covered by downgrading 
from permanent to temporary expropriation or to mere right-of-way situations. One 
measure has already been implemented when it was decided to change from open 
canal water conveyance to buried closed conduits. Smart construction techniques 
and procedures may also mitigate the disadvantages of temporary expropriation or 
loss of production. Loss of property or livelihood along Rosetta, if occuring, is 
expected to be permanent. 
Actions:
 
DBO contractor optimizes the alignments of the pipelines, roads and other works.

Measure 12 
Compensation of involuntary resettlement. 
Page  71
71
Discussion:
 Whatever remains on involuntary resettlement after avoiding and mitigating 
measures have been taken, should be compensated. More detailed information is 
given in Annex IX which contains the Executive Summary of the RPF and in the 
RPF itself. 
Actions:
 
Responsibilities for implementation of the RPF and subsequent RPs are as follows: 
1) MWRI will attach to the bidding document,  (i) a copy of the RPF; and (ii)copy of the 
rules, regulation and procedures enforced by the government of Egypt for compensation 
for involuntary resettlement;  The later specify that standard market rates are determined 
by  independent assessors which should be acceptable to the Bank,  for  market prices of 
new reclaimed lands, old lands in the Delta and along the Rosetta canal. The bidding 
document will also require that the bidders should pay the agreed market price in case full 
expropriation of land is required and /or temporary or partial land acquisition 
2) The bidding documents and DBO contract will require the successful bidder to prepare 
RP’s, in parallel to the detailed design, to mitigate involuntary resettlement issues related 
to the project.    
3) The Bank will provide its no objection to the successful bidder provided it fully 
complies with the RPF and the draft resettlement plans prepared by the successful bidder. 
The contract should stipulate that no civil works can start until the project affected persons 
(PAPs) are fully compensated. at market  rate 
4) After contract signature, the DBO contractor will officially submit to MWRI the 
necessary documentation, including detailed RP’s, for their review and approval 
5)  MWRI will be responsible to  complete the expropriation process in accordance with 
the RPF and RPs 
6) Once the expropriation/ land acquisition process is officially completed, MWRI will 
require that the DBO contractor provide them the full amount of compensation to the 
PAPs before issuing the working orders for construction  
7) MWRI will submit to the Bank in its semi annual progress report, the status of  
expropriation/land acquisition and compensations 
 
Monitoring program:
 Implementation of the Resettlement Plans will be regularly supervised and 
monitored by the PMU in coordination with the Governorate. The findings will be 
recorded in reports to be furnished to the World Bank as indicated above. 
 
Internal monitoring by PMU will follow-up on the actions needed for the Plan 
implementation; the quality of the actions undertaken;  the timely funding for 
implementing the Resettlement Plans; the administration of all grievances and their 
resolution; organize periodically external monitoring and evaluation; the outputs that 
have been delivered. 
Capacity Building:
 not
applicable.   
Executive responsibility:
 The measures to be taken to avoid or mitigate involuntary resettlement 
(it mainly relates to expropriation of land) are the responsibility of the DBO 
contractor along with HEPS, under the supervision of the PMU, because these 
precautions form part of the design process of the entire project.  
 
According to Law 10/1990 the Egyptian Authority for Land Surveying (ESA) is 
mandated to deal with overall coordination of expropriation and resettlement in 
collaboration with other ministries or local governmental bodies. In this case the 
MWRI at the national and governorate level would be the appropriate contact point 
for the DBO contractor. As indicated above, the preparation of Resettlement 
Page  72
72
Plans/Land Acquisition plans will be done by the contractor but the review of these 
plans, the signing of any documents relating to the expropriation of land should be 
the sole responsibility of MWRI. 
 
Preparation of RPs concerning any expropriation/compensation along the Rosetta 
Branch is the responsibility of the GoE/MWRI.  
 
Funds for implementing Resettlement Plans will be provided for by the project 
based on the cost estimated and presented in the Resettlement Plans. In case of 
overruns of costs due to unforeseen delays or other circumstances, the Regulatory 
Office will decide the party that will be responsible for providing necessary 
additional funds as required to cover all resettlement costs.
 
Supervision:
 PMU.  
Timing:
 
The resettlement plan has to be approved and all compensation payments completed 
prior to the start of construction  
Financing:
 
Preparing the Resettlement Plans is part of the ToR of the tender and incurred costs 
will be financed from the contract sum. Financial compensation of expropriation is 
covered by the total contract sum. Funding of the capacity building for property 
valuators will be part of component 3 of the project.
 
2.5.2 
Framework for loss of Cultural Physical Property
Measure 13 
Avoiding loss of Cultural Physical Property 
Discussion:
 
The project area is not known for archeological discoveries, nor are there any 
antique buildings. The Copt monasteries of Wadi el Natrun are outside the project 
area. Because digging for the main pipelines of the project will go deeper, the 
chance to encounter anything archeologically valuable, although small, cannot be 
completely ruled out. The safeguard procedures of Egypt for protection of 
antiquities are clear, appropriate, and applicable for WDWCIRP. The general 
contract of the MWRI regulates this issue through its clause no. 25 which make 
contractors responsible for any antiquities during excavation both by calling for the 
Supreme Council of Antiquities in the case they find any antiquity and by 
employing and pay for the technicians of the Council during the period of work. 
 
As regards potential damage to modern cultural and religious objects, the DBO has 
to follow the Egyptian Law. 
Actions: 
1)
 
Reconnaissance survey with Supreme Council of Antiquities. 
2) Design optimization to avoid any damage to cultural physical property.
 
3) Acquire clearance from the Supreme Council for Antiquities of the final design.
 
4) Apply Egyptian Law and procedures in case of unexpected encounters of 
archeological artifacts. 
Monitoring: 
The
 
DBO contractor is responsible for daily monitoring (self monitoring). Basically 
the progress of digging the alignments for the buried pipes should be followed on a 
daily basis. This will trigger immediate action if some antiquity is encountered. 
Capacity Building: 
not
applicable. 
Executive responsibility: 
actions 1, 2, 3, 4) DBO contractor along with HEPS;
 
Supervision: 
PMU along with the Supreme Council of Antiquities supervise the DBO contractor. 
Financial: 
The budget required to avoid loss of cultural physical property should be part of the 
total contract sum. Hence, the item should form part of the ToR for tendering. 
Page  73

2.5.3 
Framework for Pest Management
Pest management in the WDWCIRP project is relevant in view of the protection of groundwater 
quality. The farmers are organized in the new Water Users Council (see Annex X) and therefore 
they will have a clear role in the groundwater management plan. (See measure 7). The issue is 
covered in Section 2.3 where Integrated Pest Management is presented in the wider context of the 
Sustainable Groundwater Management Plan. 
 
2.6 
Component VI: Construction activities 
Measure 14 
Clean and Safe Construction Plan (CSCP) 
Discussion:
 The project area is predominantly used for agriculture. As it is virtually uninhabited 
the construction related impacts will not have any significant human health 
consequences, nor will these affect the living conditions of inhabitants. 
Nevertheless, a number of issues require attention. As repeatedly stated, a precise 
technical design and layout of the project are not known yet. Consequently, this 
section will only provide an overview of issues which need to be addressed in a 
detailed ESMP to be produced by the DBO contractor. 
Actions:
 
The DBO contractor will indicate in his final design how he will construct the 
project with minimal damage to the environment and with maximum safety for the 
laborers and people passing by. This Clean and Safe Construction Plan should be 
approved by the Regulatory Office before construction can start. The following 
items should get particular attention in this plan. 
 Crossings
The planned delivery and distribution system has several crossings with the SOMID 
crude oil pipeline, the Cairo 
–
Alexandria Railway (Supplementary Supply Canal) 
and the Cairo-Alexandria Desert road.  
 
It includes the necessary main structures required where the proposed mains and 
sub-mains cross existing roads, SOMID pipeline or any other obstacles. Other minor 
crossings are not included in this overview. The crossing structures are listed below: 
 
Culverts for main pipelines  
·
under Cairo Alexandria Desert Road at kilo 9 on Main 03 
·
under SOMID oil pipeline at kilo 15 on Main 03. 
·
under Cairo-Alexandria Desert Road at kilo 17 on Main 04. 
·
under SOMID pipeline at kilo 21 on Main 04. 
·
under SOMID pipe line at kilo 6 on Main 10. 
·
under SOMID pipe line at kilo 0 on Main 12. 
·
under a main asphalt road at kilo 5.5 on Main 18. 
 
This is the information from the preliminary design of the technical study; the final 
design may have a different lay-out.  
 
If crossings can be made by hydraulic jacking the disturbance will be kept to a 
minimum. However, the Desert Highway is a large obstacle for which it may not be 
possible to use this technology, especially when pipes of large diameters have to be 
jacked.  
 
The proponent will have to indicate how this crossing will be made, causing as little 
obstruction as possible to this strategic corridor. (N.B: the Desert Highway will in

the near future be upgraded to a four-laned motorway; opportunities to combine 
construction activities may be explored). 
 Construction 
Impacts
During construction activities various activities may cause local environmental 
impacts. These include:  
·
Site preparation and or leveling  
·
Excavation of materials  
·
Performing construction activities such concrete works, metal works, masonry 
works, and or electro-mechanical activities  
·
Mobilization and use of heavy construction equipment  
·
Transport of construction materials and supplies. 
 
There are mainly three common outcomes of the construction process that would 
potentially impact the environment.   
·
Dust and Particulate Emissions
:
especially during the process of excavations 
and fill using heavy construction machinery, but also from the storage of piles 
of free flowing materials in open spaces such as sand and excavated material 
piles.  Although such phenomena are temporary in nature, they may affect 
nearby agricultural lands. This process of air borne dust and particulate 
emissions may have environmental health dimensions (particularly to those 
individuals with respiratory problems), but since he area is virtually 
uninhabited this is not an issue of great importance. 
·
Creation of Spoil
.
Excavation will result in the creation of certain amounts of 
spoil which have to be dealt with in such a manner that it doe
sn’t harm 
agricultural activities in the area. 
·
Construction Waste
:
is a typical by-product of the construction process and 
may include concrete waste, masonry waste, plastics, paper, metals, wood, etc.  
Depending on the scope and location of the site specific project in question the 
generated construction waste contributes to the solid waste.   
·
Material Transport
:
during the construction process various types of material 
will be transported to the construction sites. This transport will be performed 
by heavy duty vehicles that need to pass through  small rural roads, potentially 
leading to damage.  
 
Appropriate construction management practices are required to avoid these impacts 
to occur. Such measures should be further detailed in the EMP made by the 
proponent.  
 
Monitoring program:
 The DBO contractor has the first responsibility to see that the CSCP is 
followed during construction. PMU will do regular inspections. EEAA can decide to 
exert occasionally external inspection. 
Capacity Building:
 not
applicable. 
Executive responsibility:
 The responsibility for the CSCP lies with the DBO contractor. 
Supervision:
 The PMU and EEAA 
Timing:
 
The CSCP will be ready with the final design. The monitoring takes place during the 
whole construction phase. 
Financing: 
CSCP is part of the contract and incurred costs will be covered by the contract.

75
Apart from the measure-specific components of the ESMP, a general component is included 
which provides for the required support and capacity within the PMU. The PMU has to monitor 
the implementation of the ESMP components which are assigned to Governmental Agencies, and 
follow-up the DBO contractor's obligations for the ESMP. This component comprises unspecified 
consultant services and capacity building if and when required, and a relatively large fund for 
unforeseen expenses which may appear in the other components of the ESMP. This is to allow 
flexibility of operations during the preparation and implementation of the ESMP. 
Financing: 
For PMU support a lump sum of US$ 400,000 will be set aside.

3. Monitoring 
plan 
 
The following elaborates on the monitoring activities in the ESMP that are foreseeable at 
this stage of project preparation. This chapter aims to offer a framework and guidelines for a 
monitoring plan which can only be finalized once the project design is ready and studies, which 
are proposed, have been conducted. Three levels of monitoring and evaluation are distincted. (i) 
impact monitoring, (ii) progress monitoring, and (iii) external monitoring and evaluation. 
 
3.1 
Impact monitoring 
 
This includes ex-ante effects and impact assessment and ex-post impact monitoring and 
evaluation of the WDWCIRP interventions. These activities have been described as parts of 
measures of the ESMP. 
M.3 
Monitoring the hydrological behavior of the Rosetta Branch during operational stage; 
M.5 
Monitoring the water quality of Rayah el Nasseri, Rayah el Beheiri, Nubariya and Nasser 
Canals, Rosetta Branch.  
M.8 
Monitoring the groundwater quality and quantity during operation of the project. 
M.9 
Monitoring the social development of the region. 
 
In the DRAINFRAME conceptual framework 
(World Bank-ARD 2004) 
the following 
statement is
 
made:
 “
any intervention
in the natural resources system results in changes
of the 
characteristics of the resources. These changes have an effect
on the functions of these resources, 
and finally the affected functions lead to impacts
on the users of these functions.” A good 
monitoring system will attempt to map the three connections in this cause-effect chain: 
interventions-changes-effects-impacts. The selection of the parameters to be monitored should 
reflect the causality between the distinct links. 
M.3 
The assessment study, ex-ante will assess the hydrological changes that occur in the 
Rosetta Branch when the discharge through Delta Barrage will be increased 
(intervention). The next step is to make an inventory of the functions of the river and river 
banks of Rosetta Branch along the stretch that will experience higher water levels and 
more scouring or sedimentation of the river. The connection is the effect that the changing 
hydrology has on these functions: e.g. small scale vegetable cultivation; ferry services; 
place for all kinds of buildings; natural protection against erosion; etc. The third step is to 
identify the users of these functions and quantify the economic, social or ecological 
impacts on them. 
 
The ex-post monitoring (i.e. when the hydrology has changed due to project operation) 
will follow the same steps by monitoring the right parameters: 
 
Intervention: Discharge in Rosetta Branch throughout the year. 
 
Changes: 
- Water levels in the Rosetta Branch at selected points along its course. 
 
-
Flow velocity. 
 
-
Sediment load. 
 
Effects: 
- Submerged agricultural land (permanently or seasonally). 
 
-
Affected buildings, ferry ramps, etc. 
 
-
Events of river scouring and occurrence of hazardous sediment banks. 
 
Impacts: 
- Economic damage. 
 
-
Social damage (e.g. to housing, health conditions, etc.). 
 
-
Ecological damage.
 
Page  79
79
 
To avoid the chance that certain impacts will be missed, the monitoring activity should 
also open a complaints office, where affected people can have listed their perceived 
detriments or their concern about certain developments. This activity is in line with 
Measure 12. 
M.5 
A study will assess ex-ante how the water quality of the main water conveyance system in 
the West Delta Region will change when the WDWCIRP projects become operational. An 
ex-post monitoring program will measure the following parameters:  
 
Intervention: Change in discharges in the main conveyance system at selected points. 
 
Changes: 
- a number of water quality parameters: pH, EC, Cl-, BOD, PCB, PCA, 
 Coli, etc. 
 
Effects: 
- Suitability as raw water for water treatment plants. 
 
Impacts: 
- Cost of extra treatment. 
 
-
Cost of alternative supply of raw water to treatment plants. 
M.8 
It is assumed that farmers in the project area will conjunctively use groundwater and 
surface water. However, it is difficult to predict how farmers will adapt their irrigation 
practices to the new conditions. At present the Groundwater Sector of MWRI already runs 
a
monitoring program on groundwater in the West Delta Region. This monitoring 
program will be intensified when the project becomes operational. 
 
Intervention: Supply of surface water to the project area (in m3/day). 
 
Changes: 
- Amount of groundwater pumping by farmers. 
 
-
Groundwater levels 
 
-
Groundwater quality parameters (including salinity, agro-chemical   
 
residuals, domestic and industrial pollutants). 
Effects: 
- Intensification of cultivated area. 
 
- Rate of fallow during the summer season. 
 
- Occurrence of inefficient irrigation technologies. 
 
- Use of agro-chemicals. 
 
- Suitability and availability of groundwater for domestic and industrial 
 water supply. 
 
- Occurrence of artificial recharge and open storage. 
Impacts: 
- Socio-economic impacts will be monitored under measure M.9 
M.9 
Apart from influence on the groundwater, the project also will influence the social and 
economic environment in which it is implemented. Since this is perceived an opportunity 
for regional development, a monitoring program will be carried out which follows some 
important socio-economic parameters. The results will ultimately be an input for regional 
development planners to deploy a strategy for development. 
 
Intervention: Supply of surface water to the project area (see M.8) 
 
Effects: 
- Intensification of cultivated area. 
 
Impacts: 
- Increase in agri-business. 
 
-
Number of jobs created, both permanent and temporary.. 
 
-
Change in commuting pattern. 
 
-
Cost of housing. 
 
-
Cost of land (for agriculture and in building areas) 
 
- Availability of social services in the area or near by (health care,  
 
 education, communication). 
 
-
Availability of good quality domestic water. 
 
-
Development of sewage and solid waste disposal

3.2 
Progress Monitoring and Supervision 
 
As discussed in more detail in chapter 5 of this ESMP, the responsibility for the 
implementation of the ESMP will be with the PMU. These project management units will 
supervise the various measures of the ESMP and develop an internal monitoring system on the 
progress of the actions that are undertaken. 
 
3.3 
External monitoring and evaluation 
 
External monitoring usually is the responsibility of a project steering committee. Since the 
institutional set-up has not yet been decided upon, it is not sure whether the highest project 
authority will be represented by a steering committee. 
 
It is recommended to have an external review of the ESMP performance every two years. 
The external reviewers will report directly to the EEAA and World Bank. 
 
Ongoing external monitoring of the ESMP is conducted on basis of the reports submitted 
by the project management to the Government of Egypt a.o. including EEAA and the World 
Bank.

4. 
Capacity building and training plan 
 
In this chapter the following capacity building activities in relation to the ESMP will be 
briefly discussed. Again the final program depends on the final project design. 
 
M.5: 
External support and software for water quality assessment study West Delta Region. 
 
Consultancy services will be required to make staff of DRI acquainted with new 
software, and its practical applications in the setting at hand. (see Annex VII). 
M.7: 
External support to CD-IAS for WUO strengthening. Training of Water Users 
Organization and capacity building for Groundwater Sector. 
General:
Support to PMU and RO. 
 
The structure of the WDWCIRP project management is not yet established. This ESMP 
will be supervised by the PMU but assumes a distinction between elements that deals 
with the DBO contractor, and those that will be implemented by other parties (see table 
II.1). Further it is assumed that both units have dedicated staff people who have the task 
to do the direct follow-up of the activities of the ESMP. For these staff persons the 
project should make available yet unallocated specialist consultancy services at a lump 
sum budget.  
NB! 
M.3/M.6:  The measures M34 and M.6 will feed into the Implementation Support Project for 
NWRP (NWRP-ISP); component 3: Enhanced planning capacity and capability, and 
component 4: Enhanced planning procedures. See also Table 4.1.

5. Institutional 
plan 
5.1 
Organizational setting 
The project organizational structure is outlined in Figure 1.  Overall direction will be provided by 
the Minister of MWRI and managed on a day-to-day basis by a Project Management Unit (PMU) 
which has already been established. The line department of MWRI that is trusted to overview the 
project and assists in its preparation and facilitates its implementation is the Horizontal Expansion 
Projects Sector (HEPS). Since the project will be implemented using a DBO contract with the 
private sector, the establishment of a Regulatory Office will also be necessary.  In addition, an 
Independent Panel of Experts will be set up as needed to serve as an intermediate mechanism for 
handling disputes and conflict resolution.    
 
Both the PMU and the Regulatory Office will be under the jurisdiction of MWRI. The PMU will 
include the financial management and disbursement functions and will supervise the contractual 
arrangements for the initial construction and expansion of the irrigation system.  In addition, it 
will oversee the implementation of the technical assistance components of the Project.  
Representatives of the PMU have already been designated by MWRI and have been involved 
throughout the preparation discussions.   
A
Water User Council has also been establishe
d
as an independent farmers’ organization to take 
active part in the project preparation and ultimately during implementation, to monitor the 
relationships and potential conflicts between farmers on such matters as water entitlements, 
usage, alternating hours of irrigation, etc. The Council will also monitor groundwater pumping in 
the area along with the more formal program that will be implemented by PMU within MWRI.   
The Regulatory Office will provide traditional economic regulatory functions for rate 
adjustments, tariff rebasing and will oversee the contractual commitments of the operator with 
regard to the prescribed service standards. As indicated, specialists would be recruited when 
warranted to serve in the Independent Panel of Experts to resolve specific disputed prior to formal 
arbitration in case conflicts arise between the private operator and farmers or between the private 
operator and the government.  
 
Overall management of the project components will be the responsibility the Project 
Management Unit (PMU).  The PMU will administer the DBO contract for the implementation of 
component 1 (design, build). The Unit will also administer activities for components 2 (support to 
small farmers) and component 3 (support to capacity build PMU, Regulatory Office, and Water 
User Council), as described in Annex 4. The PMU will be responsible for: (i) monitoring and 
making sure the project activities are being implemented as designed; (ii) ensuring compliance 
with contract clauses vis-à-vis the Government by the private operator (these tasks will be done 
by the Contract Management Unit under the PMU); (iii) ensuring adequate implementation of the 
TA components for strengthening the Regulatory Office, and the Water User Council as well as 
the initiatives directed at assisting small farmers.; and (iv) co-ordination, oversight, and 
monitoring of the Environmental and Social  Management Plan Framework. 
 
The ESMP framework sets out remedial, monitoring and institutional measures, 
responsibilities for implementation and related costs. The elements of the ESMP framework for 
which the borrower will be responsible to implement, and other than those related to the DBO 
contract, will be funded through the TA of Component 3 of the Project at a level of US$ 1.248 
Page  83
83
million. To ensure effective compliance, implementation and supervision of the proposed 
mitigation measures as outlined in the framework ESMP, the following will be undertaken: 
 
(i) DBO contracts: The ESMP (Executive Summary and Main Report) and the RPF will be 
appended to the bid documents. The bidding documents and the DBO contract will include 
provisions that the successful bidder will undertake develop a supplementary ESMP, RP and 
CSCP based on the final design and alignment of the surface water system and connection,  
which will be submitted to the MWRI and EEAA, in accordance with  the national 
Environmental Protection Law # 4 of 1994.  
(ii) MWRI will coordinate and cause to implement those elements of the ESMP framework for 
which it has responsibility (e.g. safe main Nile system Management Plan) and these will be 
monitored for progress by the PMU. 
(iii) The PMU will have the dual role of implementation and supervision of specific elements of 
the ESMPs. A full-time Environmental Specialist will be part of the PMU, as reflected in the 
institutional measures of the framework ESMP. For those mitigation and monitoring measures 
that the PMU is charged with implementation (e.g. safe water quality) detailed plans will be 
developed within the first year of implementation. For those that PMU is charged with 
supervision (e.g. sustainable groundwater management plan, social development) they will 
develop detailed monitoring plans.

5.2 
Overall Responsibility of the PMU 
The PMU will have to follow-up a number of measures which lie outside the obligations of the 
DBO contractor (table 5). The executive agencies are all within the MWRI, which allows for 
short lines of communication and easy coordination with the PMU. 
The PMU ago. will: 
1)  Make sure that WDWCIRP is officially recognized as horizontal expansion project (M.1). 
2)  Review the ToR for study M.4 and review the study results. before DBO contract is signed. 
3)  During the design phase, approve the ToR for studies M.5 and M.9 and appraise the results of 
the study. 
4)  Discuss the monitoring programs under M.3, M.5, M.8 and M.9 during the design phase; 
follow up the results of the data processing and analyses; formulate required follow-up 
activities based on the findings of the monitoring programs and take the required actions. 
5)  Throughout the project, provide the Technical Committee for the NWRP with information 
and justification for priority setting in the NWRP measures.  (M.1 M.6). 
6)  PMU reports on the progress of the ESMP to EEAA, SCA, World Bank.

Responsibility of the PMU relating to the private operator 
The PMU a.o. will  
1)  Make sure that the ToR for tendering contains the information needed by the bidders about 
the obligatory ESMP measures for the DBO contractor (table II.1): 
·
make an overall EIA and ESMP based upon the final design; 
·
supervise the DBO contractor for timely and correct preparation of water allocation needs 
for the WDWCIRP (M.2). 
·
optimize the system design for least expropriation and avoidance of loss of Physical 
Cultural Property M.13); 
·
prepare a Resettlement Plan (RP) with the design (M.11, M.12); 
·
prepare a Clean and Safe Construction Plan with the design (M.14). 
2)  During the design phase: review measures related to the EIA and ESMP including the RP and 
the CSCP before giving clearance for construction. 
3)  During the construction phase: supervise the progress made by the DBO contractor in 
implementing the ESMP and carefully watch the compliance with Egyptian Laws and 
Regulations. PMU will have instruments to enforce compliance with the terms in the contract 
between DBO contractor and MWRI.. 
4)  PMU reports to the EEAA, SCA, World Bank and internally in MWRI. 
 
5.4 
Staffing Requirements 
Since PMU has no definite staffing plan, it is difficult to make an assessment of the staffing 
requirement. It is proposed to create in the PMU at least one full time staff position for the day-
to-day follow-up of the ESMP.  
 
5.5 
Consultants input 
A
lump sum reservation should be made for unforeseen consultancy services. It is expected that 
Egyptian Consultants can cover this need.

6. Financial 
plan 
 
This chapter can only partly cover the financial plan. It concerns the funding of the 
studies, the monitoring and capacity building activities in as far as they do not come under regular 
programs. The cost of involuntary resettlement will follow from the project design only.

PART III:  Consultation Workshop 
1. General 
The final consultation event was held on April 22, 2007 in the Nile Helton Hotel in Cairo.  The 
consultation was designed to present the findings of the ESIA and RPF as well as the proposed 
ESMP and receive feedback from concerned stakeholders.  The consultation agenda is included 
in Annex 1. 
2. Invitations 
The list of invited participants included 74 persons representing the media, NGO’s, water users 
organization in the project area, water users downstream the project area, MWRI departments 
responsible for the implementation of the ESMP, potential private operators, EEAA, other central 
level governmental agencies relevant to the project (sanitation, agriculture, antiquities, local 
development), and relevant local governments.    The full list of invitees is included in Annex -2.  
The meeting was announced to whom ever be interested from the public through the project 
website (www.mwri.gov.eg/wdip).  Draft documents are posted at the same website and project 
invitations indicated the full website address where the documents could be found and 
downloaded. Arabic translation of the ESIA, RPF, and ESIA were prepared for distribution at the 
registration desk. 
3. Participants 
Sixty nine participants attended the workshop; the vast majority of them have come through 
direct invitations.  The invitees have either come in person or delegated colleagues in their 
respective organizations.  Media presence has been more intense than expected and participation 
from all major invited categories has taken place. The full list of workshop participants is 
included in Annex 3. News about the meeting and its outcome were in the press during the two 
following days. 
4. 
Presentation
s
Project description, ESIA, RPF as well as the proposed ESMP have been presented during the 
first session of the consultation.  The presentations have been made by the project team both from 
MWRI and the consultancy team.  During the presentations, the project team stressed the 
importance of this event as the implementation of the ESMP will be the responsibility of the 
project and affiliated parties.   The power point presentations are listed in Annex 4. 
 
5. 
Discussion
s
The final session of the consultation was devoted to a general plenary discussion where all 
participants have had the opportunity to express their views.  The project team responded with 
explanations and answers to the questions and comments. The members of the water user 
organization in the project area actively participated in the discussion and showed good 
understanding and appreciation of the issues involved.   A summary of the relevant topics and 
discussion points is given below:

-
Induced developments due to the project: 
Comment:
 NOPWASD representative commented that there is a need for coordination and 
informing NOPWASD ahead of time so that provision of water and sanitation services could be 
provided within reasonable time frame, given the complicated nature of such projects.  Dr. Adel 
El-Ghandour (a member of the WUO in the project area) indicated that the area inhabitants dream 
that the project area and surroundings would grow to be one day a stand alone governorate.  
General El-Hagrassy (a small farm owner in the project area) commented regarding the need to 
get all relevant governmental entities; such as Ministries of Interior and Transportation involved 
in the planning process of the area. 
Response:  
While the project scope is limited to improvement of irrigation water supply and it 
does not support directly urban development or social services to area inhabitants, the project has 
studied these aspects during its preparatory phases particularly the Drainframe analyses.  
Communications with Urban Development Authority and GARPAD have been initiated by the 
project team and subsequent actions by relevant authorities are expected. The outcome prompted 
MOHNC to initiate a study on West Delta Regional Planning. In the mean time, the ESMP calls 
for monitoring developments in the project area.  
 
-
Water Quality Improvement in the Rosetta Branch: 
Comment:  
NOPWASD representative commented regarding the need for coordination with 
NOPWASD regarding water quality issues in the Rosetta branch.
 
Response: 
MWRI responded that in addition to the in-depth follow up study that will take place 
as part of the ESMP, contacts are taking place between MWRI and MoHUNC at the highest 
levels regarding the improvement of drainage water quality to the Rosetta Branch. Information is 
exchanged already about the main sources of domestic/municipal pollution in order to prioritize 
the waste water treatment projects that will be implemented during the next few years. These 
communications resulted in including the relevant polluting centers, in the MoHUNC, EGP 20 
billion plan for sanitation.  
 
-
Introduction of Land Drainage in areas that will be connected to the Surface Water 
Services and neighboring areas 
Comment: 
Number of participants has shared their experience regarding the fact that introduction 
of land drainage might be needed after the connection of the area to the surface water services. 
These comments were provided by the head of El-Rash El-Gharbiea Canal WUA, Dr. Fatma 
Attia (consultant) and Dr. Samia El-Guindy (Advisory Panel Project).  The commentators 
referred to the experience in the West Nubariya area.  
Response:
 The project team and water users in the project area responded that: 
-
preparatory investigations and drainage need assessment indicated that there is no need for 
such measure; 
-
the area has been under cultivation and irrigation for relatively long period with no indication 
of
development of poor drainage conditions related problems such as water logging and/or 
salinity build up; 
-
The surface water conveyance system is a pipeline and the DBO contract service standards 
require the operator to maintain conveyance efficiency of 98%, which will mean minimal water 
losses. 
-
the fact that water users are bearing the full cost of water pumping and irrigation is promoting 
efficient water use in the area.   
Page  90
90
-
salt build up in drip irrigated areas is mitigated through leaching fraction that is designed to 
allow for salt leaching to the bottom of the root zone and it is unlikely this will lead to water 
logging problems. 
-
All the above means that shallow water table build up and/or significant seepage to the 
neighboring areas are not expected to take place.  
 
-
Prevention use of non-efficient irrigation methods 
Comment:
 Dr. Khaled Abu Zeid (Egyptian Water Partnership) asked a question regarding 
whether there is a plan for banning gravity surface irrigation in the project area?  
Response: 
The project team replied that: 
-
surface irrigation by flooding is illegal in the new lands where only drip and sprinkler 
irrigation methods are allowed, 
-
the fact that users are bearing the full cost of irrigation leads to high efficiency of water 
use.  Accordingly, the use of inefficient irrigation methods is improbable, 
-
Water Users Organizations in the project area will be actively involved in monitoring 
compliance with the law in the project area.    
 
-
Groundwater Monitoring 
Comment:
 Dr. Khaled Abu Zeid (Egyptian Water Partnership) asked whether the effect of the 
project on the groundwater in the area will be monitored and whether there are enough 
observation wells in the area. 
Response: 
The project team responded that: 
-
the ESMP has a specific measure that calls for intensification of the groundwater monitoring 
program, 
-
the number of wells inside the project area is sufficient, however more wells will be made 
outside the project area as part of the regular groundwater monitoring program of MWRI.  
 
-
Effect of the project on water availability for areas downstream of the project area on 
Ryah Nassery and Nubarya Canal  
Comment:
 Mr. Abdul-Wahab Fayed (El-Bustan WUA) asked for whether water provided for the 
project would affect water availability for El-Bustan area, which is getting its water from Ryah 
El-Nassery downstream of the project area 
Response: 
The project team responded that water diverted for the project will be compensated by 
diverting water from the Rosetta Branch to Ryah Nassery downstream of the project water intake 
from Ryah El-Nassery 
 
-
What is the Source of the Water diverted from Rosetta Branch  to Ryah Nassery 
Comment:
 Dr. Khaled Abu Zeid (Egyptian Water Partnership) asked whether the water diverted 
from Rosetta Branch to Ryah El-Nassery will be compensated by water saving from other water 
uses elsewhere.   
Response:
 The response of the team was: 
-
The project is part of the national horizontal expansion plan for the country (3.4 million acres) 
for which water supply and allocation is confirmed by the national Water Resources Plan 2017, 
-
water savings, are partly due to conversion of agricultural land into urban uses in the Nile 
Deltawhich was assessed through satellite images of the Nile Delta during the past 30 years, , 
Page  91
91
-
water savings will be also due to improvement of efficiency of water use in the old lands 
irrigated agriculture through Irrigation Improvement Project and Integrated Irrigation 
Improvement and Management Project,  
-
Other measures for providing water for the WDWCIRP as part of the horizontal expansion 
program are listed in the National Water Resources Plan.  
 
-
Monitoring of  pollution resulting from industrial and population centers 
Comment:   
Dr. Khaled Abu Zeid (Egyptian Water Partnership) asked a question regarding 
monitoring of pollution from domestic and industrial centers that will be developed due to the 
project
 
Response:
 
The project team commented that water quality monitoring is included in the ESMP 
and that pollution control will be part of the plan dealing with induced development.  Chemist 
Ikhlas Gamal El-Din (EEAA) commented that EEAA would have the leading role regarding 
monitoring industrial pollution and enforcement of pollution control regulations. 
 
-
Effect of the project on small farmers  
Comment: 
Eng. Khalaf Nassef (Env. & Water Protection West Delta NGO) commented 
regarding the fact that willingness to connect is 78% of the total project area.  Dr. Nawal El-
Tatawy (President of the WUO in the project area) followed that all users in the area are willing 
to connect, however those who have not expressed that formally are mainly small and medium 
land owners who are concerned regarding the cost of connection.  
Response:
 
The project team responded that: 
-
Willingness to connect in the first stage concession area, which is under discussion,  is 90%, 
-
the project has a component for support of small farmers in order to increase their 
competitiveness in production and marketing and hence enable them to connect to the surface 
water services, 
-
the project preserves the existing investment, 
 
-
Possibility for uncontrolled price increases by the operator 
Comment: 
Mr. Essam El-Shiekh (Goumohria Newspaper) asked: 
-
what are the governing laws and regulations? 
-
what are the safeguards against uncontrolled price increases by the operator?
 
Response: 
The project team responded that: 
-
the governing documents are the contracts and the project agreements, 
-
a
draft presidential decree has been prepared regarding PPP in the irrigation and drainage 
sector. 
-
The governing documents are drafted to prevent uncontrolled price increases. 
-
A
regulatory office will be established to enforce the terms agreed regarding the tariff and 
the service standards,
