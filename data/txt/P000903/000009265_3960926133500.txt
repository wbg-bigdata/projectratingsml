MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF GHANA
FOR A PRIORITY WORKS PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed deve-
lopment credit to the Republic of Ghana for SDR 7.8 million
(US$10.6 million equivalent) is srbmitted for approval. The proposed
credit would be on standard IDA terms with 40 years maturity and help
finance a special two-year urban priority works project. Cofinancing
amounting to SDR 3.6 (US$5 million equtivalent) is being sought. However,
this would not be committed before Board presentation.
2.        Background.  In July 1987 the Bank participated in an inter-
Agency 11 workshop with the Government of Ghana's (GOG) Social Sector Task
Force convened to develop a program of actions to mitigate the social costs
of adjustment (PAMSCAD). During the workshop GOG proposed that urgent
measures be taken to address the needs of the urban and rural poor who have
suffered a protracted decline in real income and living standards during
the past decade and who now face increased competition in the labor market
as a result of GOG's measures to retrench some 45,000 persons from the
public service and 20,000 from the public enterprise sector in 1987-89.
The Task Force focussed on five main areas: (a) employment and redeploy-
ment; (b) food, nutrition and health; (c) education and adult literacy;
(d) small farmers and women in development; and (e) shelter. Some 17
short-term interventions were identified at an estimated total project cost
of $75 million. Among the measures identified was a special two-year labor
intensive urban works program which would build on activities presently
being uadertaken under the IDA-funded Accra District Rehabilitation Project
(ADRP). This project became effective in September 1985 .Ad is progressing
satisfactorily. Basic institutional and cost recovery issues are being
effectively addressed including the revaluation of Accra property; the
revamping and computerization of the property rating, valuation billing and
collection systems; the reorganization of the City Treasurer's Department
and the strengthening of financial management and planning systems; and the
reorganization and strengthening of the Infrastructure Maintenance and
Management Systems. This program of institutional and financial reforms
would be extended to the secondary cities under the proposed second urban
project which would assist in the development of a sustained capacity to
finance and implement essential works. In the long term, it is expected
that the macro-economic adjustments now under way will increase the
capacity of the public sector to finance essential works on a sustained
basis from domestic resources, and the capacity of the private sector to
absorb manpower.
3.        Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The Bank has been assisting GOG
to develop a special program to address the social costs of adjustment.
The Priority Works Project (PWP) is an important component of this program,
and provides an opportunity to make concrete the Bank's commitment to
address the social dimensions of adjustment in Ghana and in other
l/   Including IFAD, ILO, UKODA, UNICEF, WFP, and WHO.



-2-
countries. Also, other agencies and donors have indicated a willingness to
assist GOG, given Bank leadership. Bank involvement in the urban sector
under ADRP hAs resulted in significant physical, financial and institu-
tional improvements, providing an adequate framework for the proposed
project. Because of its experience with labor intensive urban works
projects under ADRP, the Bank is in the best position to assist GOG to
develop an effective urban works program.
4.        Project Obiectives.  The primary objective of the PWP is to
support a special program of priority public works which would generate
about 10,000 productive jobs over a two-year period beginning April 1988,
and thus help to alleviate urban poverty and cushion the effect of the
impending lay-offs in the public sector. This objective would be accom-
plished through the finarcing of labor-intensive priority urban subprojects
with high economic and social rates of retuLn. Other project objectives
include helping rehabilite and maintain essential urban infrastructure;
beginning the process of helping to relieve the acute shortage of housing;
beginning the process of completing and divesting existing Government-owned
housing units; and demonstrating more appropriate and cost effective
approaches to the provision of shelter for the urban poor. Because of its
focus on employment generation and quick implementation (2 years versus the
normal 5-7 years), PWP would not attempt major institutional or financial
reform. These objectives are being effectively pursued under ADRP and
would be furthered under the proposed second urban project.
5.        Project Description.  The project includes: (a) Infrastructure
Rehabilitation and Maintenance (in four cities--Accra, Tema, Kumasi and
Seknndi-Takoradi); (b) Urban Upgrading (Accra); (c) Housing consolidation
(completion of 200 uncompleted government units); (d) Sites and Services
(Tema 400 lots); and (e) Funding for the Technical Service Center (TSC) of
the Ministry of Works and Housing (MWH) and the Ghana Highway Authority
(GRA) for project preparation, management and studies to prepare future
projects. Components "a' and lb' would form the core of the
labor-intensive works related to PAMSCAD, while "c' and "d' are pilot
components designed to test certain approaches for addressing housing and
poverty alleviation issues, prior to the proposed second urban project.
6.        The total cost of the project is estimated at US$16.8 million
equivalent. and the foreign exchange component is estimated at US$7.4
million equivalent, approximately 44Z of the total project costs. The
breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts
and methods of procurement and disbursement are shown in Schedule B. The
timetable of key project processing details ad the status of Bank Group
operations in Ghana are given in Schedules C and D respectively. Maps
(IBRD 21016 and 21017) indicating the location of subprojects are inozluded,
and the Staff Appraisal Report (No. 7000-GH, dated December 3, 1987) is
attached. Cofinancing is being sought for the urban upgrading component,
but would not be committed before Board presentation. Also, the local
costs of part of the site and services component would be financed by the
Social Security and National Insurance Trust (SSNIT). Project preparation



-3
would be financed through a US$1 mi4lion Project Preparation Facility
(PPF).
7.        Actions Agreed.  The following were agreed at negotiations: the
action plan for project implementation; the procedures that GOG would adopt
to ensure that contract evaluation and approvals would be expedited; the
terms and conditions for SSNIT financing; the terms and conditions for BHC
participation in the project; the terms and conditions for acquisition of
uncompleted units; the terms and conditions for the transfer/sale of
completed units; the terms and conditions for the leasing and subleasing of
land for sites and services development; the program for strengthening
and/or establishment of implementing units in Accra, Tema, Kumasi and
Sekondi-Takoradi; the establishment of coordinating conmittees for the
project; and the program for strengthening TSC and GHA.
8.        Benefits.  This project will provide about 10,000 man-years of
employment spread over two years, particularly benefitting poor unemployed
workers within urban centers. In addition, this project will directly
benefit households and firms through: reduced vehicle operating costs,
travel time, traffic congestion and accidents, improved health, sanitation,
water supply, and other amenities; improved environment; increased property
values and increased supply of housing. Based on indicative calculations
and the experience of ADRP, the average economic rate of return (ERR) is
estimated at about 30Z. It is also estimated that about 70-802 of project
expenditures would directly or indirectly benefit the urban poor.
9.        Risks. The main risk is that the short-run implementation
capabilities of existing agencies may be overextended, leading to imple-
mentation delays and the breakdown of supervision and financial control.
This would be addressed under the project by strengthening the managerial
capacity of the implementing ministries and agencies through the recruit-
ment of qualified staff and the employment of local private consultants
where necessary.
10.       Recommendation.  I ar satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
