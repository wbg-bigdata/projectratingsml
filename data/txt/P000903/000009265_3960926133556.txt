MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT'
SUBJECT:    Project Completion Report on Republic of Ghana
Priority Works Prolect (Credit 1874-GH)
Attached is the "Project Completion Report on the Republic of Ghana -
Priority Works Project (Credit 1874-GH),"? prepared by the Infrastructure
Operations Division of the Western Africa Department.  Part IT contains the
Borrower's perspective.   It highlights the drawbacks of proceeding on an
emergency  footing without  adequate  billing,  accounting  and  disbursement
arrangements.
The project took more than twice as long as expected.   But it
achieved its main objectives viz the support of an emergency program of priority
public works and the generation of employment needed to mitigate the adverse
impacts of an adjustment program in Ghana. In particular, the project helped
create a number of short-term jobs at reasonable cost. Problems arose in setting
up a project management unit, administering labor intensive works and acquiring
land needed for the implementation of the housing sub-component.   Complex
cofinancing arrangements and overly elaborate contractual procedures contributed
to the delays.
Lessons learnt in designing and implementing emergency operations
highlight the importance of defining realistic objectives and opting for simple
administrative arrangements, including streamlined procurement and disbursement
procedures.   Multiple objectives are difficult to achieve in an emergency
situation.    Therefore,  it  is  not  surprising  that  project  attempts  at
demonstrating cost-effective construction techniques for housing and at divesting
existing Government-owned housing units were not successful.
On balance, the project outcome is rated as satisfactory,
institutional development impact as partial, and sustainability as uncertain.
The PCR is adequate. However, there is no economic analysis and no
comment by cofinanciers.   The project may be audi-ted along with the Accra
District Rehabilitation Project (Credit 1564-GH).

R=IORITY WORKS PROJECr (CREDrr 1874G-})
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (fPCR) for the Priority Works Proaej in Ghana for which
Credit 1874-OH, in the amount of SDR 7.8 million (US$10.6 million equivalent) was approved on
January 26, 1988. The credit was closed on December 31, 1992, two years and a half behind
schedule. Disbursements against commitments were made through April 30, 1993. An undisbursed
balance of US$9,835.52 remains in the Special Account. It is very likely that this amount will be
canceled once the Special Account is fully recovered.
The PCR (Preface, Evaluation Summary, Parts I and m) has been based on a review of the Staff
Appraisal Report, President's Report, the Development Credit and Project Agreements, supervision
reports, correspondence between the Bank and the Borrower, and internal Bank memoranda. Part H
was prepared by the Borrower.
The Task Manager for this PCR is Eleanor Warner. The Division Chief and Director for this
operation are Messrs. James Wright and Edwin Lim.

PRIOQR    WORKS PROJECT (CREDIT 1874-GM
EYALUhATIN SUMMARY
i.    Tne project objectives were to: (i) support a special program of priority public works which
would generate productive jobs over a two-year period; (ii) rehabilitate and maintain essential urban
infrastructure; (iii) relieve the acute shortage of housing; begin the process of completing and divesting
existing Government-owned housing units; and (iv) demonstrat.- more appropriate and cost-effective
approaches to the provision of shelter for the urban poor. rae v roject was successful in generating
employment, but it was less successful in demonstrating cost-effective house construction techniques.
Implementation Exnerince
ii.   Implementation of the project took over twice as long as anticipated, four and a half years
instead of two. One major reason for implementation delay was due to a change in leadership shortly
before credit effectiveness. The project was initially intended to be cleared as a package, but the
concept had to be changed. Instability at the top meant that authority to drive the project and
procedural arrangements for procurement was lacking (para 36).
iii.   Another major cause was the delay in signing the cofinancing agreemens, which took effect in
1990, about two years after the start of the project (para 8, a). Further delays occurred in the
procurement procedures due to lack of familiarity of the MMAs with Bank procurement guidelines (this
was mitigated to some extent by experienced staff of the PMU, para 8, c), and with the joint
cofinancing arrangements, which were cumbersome to administer.
Results
iv.    Most of the physical works were accomplished as anticipated, though with delays. By the close
of the project a total of 271 subprojects had been developed in the four project cities, Accra, Kumasi,
Sekondi-Takoradi and Tema. The IDA credit of SDR 7.8 miSlion (US$10.6 million equivalent) was
almost entirely drawn down, as were the loans of $5.9 million and $4.8 million from KfW and OPEC,
respectively.
v.    Employment generation, a major objective of the project, amounted to 8,472 person years at an
average cost of US$2,122 per job. This was a significant achievement given the volume of startup
administrative difficulties, and the limited technical and fmancial capacity of the local contractors. The
actual  mber of jobs created fell short of the SAR target by 21% while the average cost per job
increased by 32% (para 24).
vi.   The major focus of the project was fast employment generation during project implementation
(paras 24 to 26). The emergency aspect tended to override the longer term issue of sustainability.
This is evidenced by the absence of a housing policy or detailed preparatory work on which to base
components such as site development and housing consolidation. Without prior policy agreements the



- lit -
project fell short of the fbllowing objecdves which relae to sustinability: (a) beginning the process of
divesting Government-owned housing units; and (b) demonstrating the effectiveness and appropriateness
of the sites and services concept.
vii.   On the institutonal side, the project helped to strengthen capacity in Ghana's urban institutions,
namely Deparment of Urban Roads (DUR) of the Ministry of Roads and Highways (MRH) and
Technical Services Center (TSC) of MWH, which now continue their involvement in follow-on
projects. -ne infrastructure rehabilitation could be sustained with adequate budgetary allocation for
maintenance which the GO has committed itself to (see SAR for the Ghana Urban Transport, Report
No 11674-GH). Similarly, sustainability could be ensured for the urban upgrading component (Urban
n Project, SAR No. 8331-OH) with the possibility of increased municipal revenues from higher
property rates (para. 34).
Findings and Lessons
viii, Labor intensive works are complex to administer and should be avoided on
an emergency basis. This type of work should form part of a longer structured program with due
consideration to the practicality of the construction methods and economic efficiency (para 8, f).
ix.    Land required for the project should be acquired before project effxtiveness to help avoid
lengthy startup delays (para 10, I 1).
X.    Joint cofmancing should be avoided for emergency projects, particularly where there is a large
number of relatively small contracts; parallel cofinancing in which discrete procurement packages are
financed by separate donors would have worked more effectively. Future emergency projects should
opt for a simplified method of project delivery (para 18).
xi.   Timely payments to small contractors are critical for the development of the local contracting
industry (para 8, b).

PART I. PROJECT REVIEW FROM W)A'S PERSPECTIVE
A.  oej Idgll1ity
Name:        Priority Works Project
Credit No:    1874-GH
RVP Unit:   Afri_a Region
Country:     Republic of Ghana
Sector:     Infrastrucure
B. Background
1.    An economic recovery program embarked upon by the Government with Bank assistance
succeeded in placing the Ghanaian economy once again on a growth path after a period of protracted
decline. To redress some of the adverse social impacts resulting from the fiscal adjustment program,
the Government, with Bank assistance, developed a Program of Actions and Measures to Address the
Social Costs of Adjustment (PAMSCAD) which identified an action plan for quickly generating
employment and dealing with issues confronting the poor. The priority works project formed an
important component of the Bank-assisted initiatives under PAMSCAD. The project was conceived as
a supplementary credit to the Accra District Rehabilitation Project (ADRP), building on and extending
the works carried out by the institutions implementing the ADRP. The time frame for implementing all
co^mponents of the Priority Works Project (PWP) was expected to be two years, in response to the need
to generate new jobs in the short run.
C. Project Objectives and Description
2.    The primary objective of the PWP was to support a special program of priority public works
which would generate about 10,000 productive jobs over a two-year period beginning April 1988. This
objective was to be accomplished through the financing of labor-intensive priority urban subprojects
with high economic and social rates of return. Other objectives included helping to rehabilitate and
maintain essential urban infrastructure; helping to relieve the acute shortage of housing; beginning the
process of completing and divesting existing Government-owned housing units; and demonstrating more
appropriate and cost-effective approaches to the provision of shelter for the urban poor.
3.    The project as described in the Staff Appraisal Report included:
PAMSCAD Related Components
(a)   Infrastructure Rehabilitation and Maintenance in Accra, Tema, Kumasi and Sekondi-
Takoradi: Extension of works being undertaken under ADRP, includiig: (i)-Drainage-
desilting and excavation of earth channels, clearing of existing open-lined channels,
construction of key lengths of new open drains and culverts; (ii) Roadworks-road
cleansing, provision of curbs, key intersection improvements, bus bays, patching of
areas of road deterioration, and sidewalks; (iii) Traffic Management-intersection and



-2 -
lane marking, safety and road name signs, and pedestrian 'zebra' crossing; (iv)
Sewerage (Tema only)-replacement of failed sewer lines; (v) Streetlighting-rehabilitation
of columns and lanterns on important roads and intersections (Accra and Sekondi-
Takoradi only); and (vi) Maarket (Kumasi only)-rehabilitation of drains and walkways.
(b)    Urban Upgrading (Accra): Extension of works being undertaken in the most extensive
slum areas in Accra and Tema under ADRP including: (i) provision of roads, water
supply, secondary and tertiary drainage, streetlightiLng, and
public sanitary conveniences (KVIPS) in West Nima and Ashaiman; (ii) provision of
tertiary drainage in East Maamobi; and (iii) lining the Odaw stream in West Nima.
Pilot Components
(c)    Housing Consolidation (Accra and other cities): A pilot subproject to complete 200 of
5,000 uncompleted government units; 100 for rent to government employees, and 100
for sale through the Bank for Housing and Construction (BHC) to the private sector.
(d)    Sites and Services (Tlema): (i) site development-A pilot subproject, including the
development of 400 serviced plots for sale to companies, organizations and individuals
for low-income housing; (i) Credit for site consolidation-a line of credit to BHC to
assist companies, organizations and individuals, to finance the construction of low-
income housing units on the sites and services plots; and
Institutional Support
(e)    TSC and GHLA/DUR Support 1/, Funding for TSC and DUR to assist in preparing,
managing and monitoring the project, undertaking studies to improve employment
generation under the project and undertaking studies to prepare future projects.
D. Project Design and Organization
4.    PWP was designed to assist with short-run employment generation through the financing of
labor-intensive priority urban subprojects. Because of its focus on employment generation and quick
implementation (2 years versus the typical 5-7 years), PWP did not attempt major institutional or
financial reform. These objectives were being pursued under a parallel project Accra District
Rehabilitation Project (Credit 1564-GH).
5.    Main responsibility for project implementation resided with the Ministries of Roads and
Highways (MRH) and Works and Housing (MWH), both of which were responsible for executing the
ADRP. Responsibility for implementation of the infrastructure rehabilitation works in Accra, Tema,
Kumasi and Sekondi-Takoradi resided with the Department of Urban Roads (DUR) in coordination widt
the related metropolitan municipal authorities (MMAs). TSC was responsible for the implementation of
the urban upgrading, housing consolidation and sites and services components. BHC was required to

for urban roads from the Ghana Highway Authority (GHA).



-3 -
assist MWH and TSC to implemnent the two latter components. This arrangement was expected to
enable TSC to focus on technical issues within its competence, and draw upon BHC's considerable
financial and commercial experience in sales and financing of houses and sites.
6.    To coordinate the project while providing policy direction, an Interministerial Committee
comprising the PNDC Secretaries for Roads and Highways, Works and Housing, and Local
Government was established, which was expected to meet monthly. The committee was assisted by
senior officials of the respective ministries, the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning WEP),
TSC and DUR. Project advisory committees (PACS) were also established in each project city to
provide local policy guidance to the roads units, ensure coordination with work of the City or District
Council and monitor project performance. The institutional arrangements fir the project worked well
for the purposes intended.
E. Project Implementation
Credit Effectiveness and Project Start-up
7.    The credit became effective in June 1988, but got off to a slow start due to a 7-month delay in
setting up the project management unit within DUR and a further 3-month delay in hiring key
professional staff for the unit. The change in leadership at the MWHI shortly before credit effectiveness
contributed to this delay. Further start-up delays were caused by GOG's tardiness in finalizing
cofinancing agreements with OPEC and ICFW which did not become effective until mid-1990. 'Me
effects of these delays are reflected in significant lags in disbursement (See chart in Part M, Table 3).
Implementation
8.    The project was originally scheduled to be implemented between June 1988 and June 1990.
Most of the project components did not end until December 1992, however. The main reasons for the
delay were:
Cofinancing
(a)   lengthy delays by GOG in finalizing and signing the cofinancing agreements; the result
was that cofinancing funds came on board about two years later than MA funds;
(b)   complication with joint financing by 4 financiers where each cofinancier met a
proportion of the costs of a component. This method turned out to be impracticable
given the large number of relatively small contracts involved; the accounting became
very complex as each financier had its own method of disbursement and unique project
conditions. The resultant administrative bottleneck in processing contractors' payments
led to delays in payments which, in turn, slowed progress, and in some cases, caused
some of the small contractors to declare bankruptcy;
Procurement
(c)    unfamiliarity of the MMAs in Kumasi, Sekondi-Takoradi and Tema with Bank
procedures, especially the procurement guidelines. This was mitigated to some extent



-4-
by the PMU, whose staff were familiar with the Bank's procedures, but the actual
contracts had to be signed by the MMAs and they therefore dictated the pace of
implementation;
(d)   the protracted GOG procurement approval process which affected the larger subprojects
such as Nima Stream Channel and West Nima Upgrading;
Loalstigs
(e)    underestimation of the number of separate contracts that tabor intensive works involve
and the consequent administrative effort required to manage them; and
(f)   in some cases, the objective of creating employment was allowed to overrule issues of
construction practicality and economic efficiency. Engineering works which are most
appropriately carried out by equipment intensive construction were allowed to be done
by labor intensive techniques.
9.    What MA and the Borrower could have done to avoid project delays is discussed as lessons
learned in paras via through xi of the Preface.
Housing Consolidation
10.   After a lengthy and problematic identification process a total of 16 contracts were let for the
completion of 206 housing units. A total of 106 have been allocated as rental units for housing
Goverunent staff, and are now occupied. The remaining 100 units are saleable by BHC at market
rates. Of these latter units, 64 have already been sold while sale of the remaining 36 is delayed by
flooding of the area (Teshie-Nungua). TSC identified the need for construction of an interceptor drain
to the north side of the site to catch and divert surface run-off and commissioned the necessary designs;
additional funds have been requested by TSC from the GOG to fund the required civil works.
Site and Services
11.   Site development eventually was completed after a lengthy land acquisition process. After the
site located at Tema Community 3) was developed, a decision was taken by GOG not to proceed with
the sites and services concept on that location. The developed site was instead sold to SSNIT for a
total of ¢170 million for more intensive consolidation with medium income apartment blocks. A total
of $0.3 million which was originally allocated for site consolidation was shifted to the Housing
Consolidation component of the project for completion of 18 three-room middle-income housing units
at Madina, Accra.
Urban Upgrading
12.   Contracts for Nima Stream channelization were originally awarded to four relatively small labor
intensive contractors in April 1989. It transpired that these contractors had insufficient equipment and
financW resources to cope with the works, the execution of which was complicated by particularly
heavy rains. Ihe contracts had to be terminated and the work re-awarded to a single large contractor.
The West Nima and Ashaiman upgrading works went relatively smoothly, though final completion at
West Nima was affected by the delays to Nima Stream. The works carried out included chaimelization
of 1,400 meters of the Nima Stream, construction of some 20 km of drains, 6 foot bridges, installation



of 18.5 km of pipelines, electrification of the uipgraded area, construction of 4.9 km of access roads,
8.9 km of sidewalks, and installation of 85 KVIP units. Community participation was positive, helped
by Welfare and Planning Comrunities formed within the communities.
13.   Early valuation by the Land Valuation Board (LVB) enabled determination of compensation due
to residents of buildings affected by the upgraded area. A total of 164 properties were affected and
1,500 persons displaced with total compensationi of 0241 milliori due from dae GOG.
Inrrastructure Rehabilitation & Maintenance
14.   About 235 contracts were completed for this component in the four project cities: Accra 73,
Tema 60, Kumasi 57, Sekovdi-Takoradi 45. The contracts were varied in size arid averaged about
US$30,600. Many were smalt antd Involved minor works such as pot hole patching, clearing drains
and installing culverts, while others such as those at Suame in Kumasi and Tema Station Lorry Park in
Accra, involved investments of over US$1 million. Progress was much slower than anticipated because
protracted contract approval and award process and: (a) the authorities in Kumasi, Tema and Sekondi-
Takoradi were unfamiliar with Bank procedures, particularly the guidelines relating to procurement; (b)
the cofinancing arrangement required in many cases four separate payments to be made to contractors;
this led to delays in payment which in rum delayed execution of works; and (c) the sheer number of
contracts placed an enormous workload on the PMTJ.
Rehabilitation of Sewerage System
15.   Rehabilitation of three systems was concluded. The three are now functioning effectively.
There was no major issue on this component.
Equipment for Solid Waste Management
16.   In October 1992 delivery was made of 3 side loader and 4 skip loading trucks, which were
distributed to Kumasi, Tema and Sekondi/Takoradi, the four project cities. Procurement of spare parts
for the vehicles was also included in the project.
World Food Program
17.   The World Food Program (WFP) provided incentive for work in the form of food parcels
which helped to increase worker productivity. A total of 51,960 food packages were distributed. The
WFP assistance to the project ended during the third quarter of 1992.
Corinancinig Arrangrements
18.   Late effectiveness of the cofinancing arrangement led MA to advance project funding which
should have been provided by OPEC and KfW. Ibis led to a tedious process of reconciling financial
contributions between MA, KfW, OPEC and GOG once the respective agreements became effective.
The adoption of joint financing and the proportioning of project categories, rather than parallel
financing, placed an unnecessary accounting burden on the PMU which was a major cause of the delays
to the project (para 8 a & b). It is strongly recommended that parallel financing should be adopted for
such projects in the future.



-6-
19.   The estimated cost of the project at appraisal was US$16.8 million. The costs were revised in
1990 to reflect additional loan agreements by KfW and OPEC. Based on this revision total costs were
estimated at US$22.7 million. The actua cost was approximately $45,000 less than this estimate (Part
HI, Tables 4 and 5).
20.   The actual disbursements of the credit are given in Part M Table 3. Disbursement tags were
caused by the protracted project implementation period (para 8). The original closing date was June
1990; but the credit was closed on December 31, 1992, after two extensions of the closing date. The
credit was fully disbursed against works completed by December 31, 1992.
Cmlit Allocation
21.   The original and revised allocations and acual disbursements for the credit are shown in Part
M, Table 6. The allocations were revised in July 1989 and again in September 1990, pLimarily to
reflect changes in the financing of the Ifrastructure Rehabilitation and Maintenance and Urban
Upgrading components after the cofinancing agreements were signed.
F. frojet Reults
Project Obiectives
22.   The project was successful in meeting its main objectives, namely, supporting a special
program of priority public works which generated productive jobs over the project period;
rehabilitating and maintaining essental urban infrastructure, and helping to relieve the shortage of
housing. The project was less successful in demonstrating appropriate and cost-effective approaches to
the provision of shelter for the urban poor as the developed site was put to alternate housing use, and
in divesting existing Government-owned housing units. It appears, in retrospect, that this latter
objective might have been too ambitious within the context of an emergency project and in the absence
of a well-defined housing policy or a structured program for housing divestiture.
Physical Results
23.   The physical targets of the project were achieved substantially as planned. A total of 271
subprojects had been developed in the four project cities of Accra, Kumasi, Sekondi Takoradi and
Tema. Table 7 (Part D) shows details of project activities with cost and employment targets matched
against actual achievements. Improvements to the urban upgrading areas are readily apparent. It is
anticipated that these improvements will be reflected in higher property values which should lead to
increased property rating revenue for the Metropolitan Authorities. Finally, the positive aspects of the
project have had a demonstrative effect which could lead to replication.



-7-
Employment
24.   The project was instrumental in creating a significant number of short-ter- jobs which helped
cushion the effects of the civil service retrenchments which were occurring at the time. Employment
generation was intended to be a bridging response while fundamental longer-term programs were being
p . in place. Current estimates are that employment generated as a result of the project amounted to
8,472 person years, which includes a 15% estimate for employment generated indirectly. The number
of jobs created fell below expectations by about 21 % and the average cost per job increased by 32 %.
Table 7 provides further details of employment generation.
25.   In retrospect, it appears that the targets were too optimistic given the time constraints for
preparation of this component, the capacity of the local contracting industry (which was overstretched
by the project) and the administrative complexity of the project. Some decisions based on maximizing
employment were made in the absence of detailed analysis which tumed out to be very costly. The
channelling of Nima Stream, for example, was subdivided into four different contracts, to encourage
employment of relatively small labor intensive contractors. However, the contractors were not
sufficiently liquid to survive the delays in payment, which occurred due to the complex cofinancing
arrangements under the project, and all four contractors went bankrupt. The decision to split the job
into four contracts required a level of technical and financial resources, coordination and management
which the original small contractors did not have. The result was that the final cost of this component
was 87% higher than anticipated.
26.   On the other hand, the experience of PWP made the MMAS, the Project Units and the
contractors more aware of the benefits arising out of a disciplined contractual process. It also provided
the MMAs with replicable project implementation experience.
Financial Performance
27.   The project did not address financial viability and cost recovery issues explicitly. These issues
were addressed in projects under implementation at the same time, namely, ADRP and Urban 11. The
costs of housing construction were to be recovered from the purchasers; the urban upgrading and the
infrastructure rehabilitation from property taxes. Tlis has happened under ADRP and Urban I.
purchasers; the urban upgrading and the infrastructure rehabilitation from property taxes. This has
happened under ADRP and Urban 11.
Economic Performance
28.   At the time of appraisal, the economic rate of return (ERR) was estimated on the basis of the
ERR calculations done for the ADRP. Specific cost benefit analyses were not done for the main
project components, infrastructure rehabilitation and maintenance, urban upgrading, housing
consolidation, and sites and services development, but was based on similar work done for the ADRP
(SAR No. 5327-GH and PCR dated April 6, 1993).
Infrastructure Rehabilitation and Maintenane
29.   This component amounting to 39% of total project costs was spread over four cities (Accra,
Kumasi, Tema, Sekondi-Takoradi), about half of it in Accra. The work consisted of patching pot-
holes, drainage clearance and improvements, pavement repairs, and other minor works to improve the
badly deteriorated urban roads on a selective basis. The benefits consist mainly of reduced vehicle



operating costs, reduced travel time, and reduced traffic congestion and accidents. The ex post ERR
for similar works (rehabilitation of Motorway 11) under the ADRP has been estimated at 56%, which
compares favorably with the SAR estimate of 40% for components under the PWP.
Urban Upgrading
30.   This component totalled 30% of total project costs and provided basic amenities of water
supply, drainage, refuse collection, sanitation, street lighting and accessibility in two of the poorest
areas in Accra and Tema. The main benefit quantified is the estimated increase in property values as a
result of the project improvements. The market price (excluding taxes) for a room in a mudbrick
structure in a comparable area (East Maamobi) is estimated at C280,000 compared to C50,000
estimated at appraisal. This type of housing is estimated to comprise 80% of the structures while
another 20,% are single-family cement block structures (3-bedroom single family) and these sell for
about ¢4.7 million each, or about C780,000 per room. Ml real terms property values almost tripled.
Based on the analysis done for ADRP, this type of increase in property value as a result of upgrading
of an area with similar characteristics has been associated with an ERR of over 300%.
Housin! Consolidation
31.   This component comprised 11% of total project costs. A total of 206 unfinished housing units
were completed and most have already been put to use. Without the project investment these
incomplete cement/concrete structures had practically no market value since not much of its materials
could be salvaged for other uses. The major project benefit lay in making these units fully marketable.
This has been achieved and 170 units are now occupied (106 government rentals and 64 sold); the
remaining 36 will be sold after additional drainage work is completed (para. 10).
Sites and Services Component
32.   This component comprised 3% of total project costs. The project was expected to develop 5.7
ha of land in Tema for low income housing purposes; this did not materialize as planned. Instead, the
site once developed was sold for construction of medium income apartment blocks.
G. Project Sustainability
33.   The project focussed largely on temporary employment generation; it also provided major
infrastructural improvements in Ghana's four main cities. Sustainability depends on continued funding
allocation for maintenance of these improvements. Higher property rates as a result of the urban
upgrading should lead to increased revenue for the MMAs and consequently to increased funding for
maintenance. The roads component could be sustained by increased central Government funding which
the GOG is committed to (see SAR for the Ghana Urban Transport Project, Report No 11674-GH).
34.   The project provided continuity for the strengthening of key agencies (TSC and DUR) created
under ADRP and their effectiveness could be sustained provided the necessary budgetary allocation is
made. Good project management units have been created in DUR, and MWH which continue to
function under the Urban II project. Competent professional staff have been trained which is a benefit
for the relevant agencies.



H. IDA PeEforance
35.   Fast preparation was necessary to satisfy the immediate objectives of the project, but this led to
a number of problems and delays experienced during implementation. The cofinancing arrangement,
for example, which IDA and the GOG agreed to, created major delays and resulted in overly complex
accounting procedures as individual contracts were jointly financed by cofinanciers each with their own
guidelines and requirements. Future emergency projects should adopt parallel financing instead of joint
financing to avoid the types of bottlenecks encountered in this project.
36.   IDA maintained a flexible approach during implementation and helped bridge the financing gap
until cofinanciers' funds became available. MA also encouraged institutional development in. TSC and
DUR through training. Project supervision averaged 17.5 staffweeks per year which was adequate.
I. Borrower Performane
37.   Changes at the policy level slowed the pace of project execution at the start of the project.
Shortly before project effectiveness there was a discontinuity in leadership of the Ministry of Works
and Housing. This had an adverse effect on the sites and services component. Arrangements to utilize
a consortium of engineers broke down; all the programming was neglected and this negatively affected
the manner in which contracts were issued. As implementation proceeded stability was restored and
good cooperation with IDA led to the creation and strengthening of competent project units which
proved to be an asset in project execution. Staff have been employed for implementation of the Urban
H Project.
J. Consulting Services
38.   Most of the design and supervision work was carried out by local consultants, and they
performed well. Tbis provided for excellent capacity building which continues under Urban U. The
project provided for 560 manmonths of technical assistance. Project consultants provided valuable
assistance during implementation, particularly in setting up systems in financial management and
accounting which continue to be used under follow-on projects. A good relationship existed between
the consultants and project agencies.
K. Project Documentation and Data
39.   A total of 21 progress reports (10 quarterly, 6 monthly, 2 half-yearly and 3 annual) were
reviewed. Annual reports were initially prepared only for the infrastructure rehabilitation and
maintenance component which was managed by the DUR. TSC's implementation responsibility, on the
other hand, included urban upgrading, housing consolidation, and site and services, and initially
prepared only quarterly reports. Upon completion of the infrastructure rehabilitation component,
annual reports were prepared by TSC on the remaining components. The flow of the reports followed
the SAR stipulation that both TSC and MWH submit quarterly reports to the Bank on the physical and



- 10-
finncial components for which they had implementing responsibility. This arrangement was improved
upon in 1990 when the PMU of DUR was selected to coordinate the flow of reports. Reports issued
after July 1, 1990 followed this 'consolidated' approach.

PART II. PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORROWER'S PRSPECTIVE
Iception and Start uI of PWP
1. These commets relate to the infrascture rehabilitation and maintenance component implemented
by DUR. PWP contract implementation commenced in November 1988 well ahead of a structured
management procedure. This latter was initiated in January of 1989 when a Management Unit
Consultant insalled a full team of personnel assuming control of the day to day administration and
direction of the project.
2. Consequently, preliminary studies intended to facilitate the management procedures
could only be initiated after actual implementation was underway.
3. In view of this some initial contract batches were reviewed in a quick manner with the
result that contract documents were not sufficiently detailed or lacked approprate desigii detail and
specifications for the purpose intended. In other instances the depth of detail provided were
subsequently found to be an over elaboration both unnecessary and cumbersome to the supervision and
monitoring processes.
4. The net effect has been two-fold:
(a)    The delay in implementation of studies and consequently the absence of  clearly
defined procedures at that early stage did not make for an enhanced project
implementation and extended the planned project duration.
(b)    Then the form of conacs developed were in various instances not convenient
to the activities envisaged and the preferred small to medium scale contractor
groups best suited to the labor intensive objectives of PWP. The elaborate detail of such
contracts awarded resulted in an over extended performance. Simpler term order contracts
were found to be best suited for the purpose.
5. The planned implementation in four broad overlapping phases beginning with
subproject activities that are suited to a quick start up and at the same time likely to generate the
desired levels of employment was therefore not wholly realized. Over the period of the project, there
have been seeral contract batches offered to tender and subproject selection has had to be reviewed
even late in the project life.

Project Funding
Tne experience gained in this project has driven home the point that to be effective and efficient
with multiple fuiding sources, the methods implemented must be carefully considered. These can best
be understood by a breakdown and evaluation of the individual issues involved.
6. Tbe funding on this project comprised as follows:
(a) Each of the 4 funding sources, i.e. (IDA, OPEC, KfW, GOG) contributed a percentage of total
funds for each budgetary line item. These percentages also varied for each line item.
(b) Due to contractual delays, funds were not available in a timely manner and caused serious
problems in project implementation and progress.
(c) Due to the above, the project had absolutely no chance of success but for the immediate
intervention and involvement of the World Bank in allowing a large percentage comrnitment
which were subsequently adjusted.
(d) Full funding and efficient cash flow was fimally in place only after IS months of project
operation.
Problems Encountered
7. When multiple funding is a commendable endeavor, problems quickly surfaced in the
implementation. The breakdown of percentages at individual subproject levels rapidly created an
administrative and accounting issue. The end result being a fourfold increase in accounting, invoicing,
administrative and funds replenishment efforts. Simply put, no one had any idea of the work effort and
paper avalanche that this was to create. This concept may have been manageable for 6 or 8 or 20
contracts but to attempt this with 250 plus contracts with 40 or so open at any one time is neither
logical nor effective.
8. This project started and began awarding contracts that involved funds not yet in place. More
importantly, the agreements for funding weren't concluded. Even though the World Bank was
extremely cooperative and exhibited remarkable flexibility, this did not fully resolve the problems
raised. In effect project accounting was confronted with both rectifying the past and keeping up with
current work load. It was a near impossible situation and took months to correct without fully
recovering the balance and control of accounting.
Recommendations for Future Funding
9. Implementation must be simplified. If the funding is on a percentage basis, it may be best to pool
funds with a single administrative control and a unified accounting/reporting system. This will
inunediately reduce the administrative and accounting work load to one set of invoices for any one
payment, as it should logically be.
10. It cannot be overstated that all funding be in hand prior to actual project inception. It would be
much more prudent to postpone the project rather than commit in a prei._ture and cavalier fashion.



- 13 -
Contractor Invoicing and Paymnnts
11. The project implementation process suffered a number of problems that were never truly solved.
Problems surfaced at the very beginning of the initiation of an invoice. When an invoice is put
together by the contractor and the City Roads Engineer, it is often incomplete in documentation or
wasn't properly vetted causing the invoice to be rejected or set aside pending its review. This issue is
compounded by distance and the lack of proper communications. Once these issues were corrected, a
flow path of signatories for approval of payment is extremely cumbersome and in fact required 32
signatories from invoice inception through replenishment of funds. This took from 30 to 60 days to
process. The payment issue was further complicated by the fact that each financier had a percentage of
the project invoice and therefore multiple payments became an issue when the cost of time required for
this effort of mr,ltiple payments was imposed on an already overburdened accounting staff. Further
complaints were received when money was placed into the contractors bank account in split percentages
over a time span.
12. Given this situation, contractors often times were stalled as they awaited the release of payments to
enable work to continue. The above, combined with the reimbursement efforts of the percentage
system effectively quadrupled the accountant's work load.
Recommendations for Pannent Processing
13. The project implementation structure needs to be further reviewed with a deliberate effort to cut
drastically the time span in processing of payrnent certificates.
Employment Generation
14. Ihe project offered a great opportunity to small scale contractors and a large selection of casual
workers. Though as one person would have maintained a job placement over the entire duration of
PWP activities. The short term opportunities offered enabled welcome relief to otherwise unemployed
groups with the total effect no doubt contributing to depress the level of unemployment in the project
cities. The employment level achieved has been established as 79% of target intentions.
15. The apparent shortfall in the project intention can be explained by escalated design and construction
implementation not anticipated, (32% in excess of target). This occurred irrespective of foreign
exchange gains realized.
16. Further still, some key work items identified were essentially not labor oriented but had a
significant import on the overall project realization. Then a significant consideration for future projects
would be one aimed at achieving a true balance in capital and labor intensive works both answering to
the labor generation objectives and achieving the infrastructure improvement targets.
Comments from the Technical Service Center
17. This is the summay of a detailed project completion report prepared by TSC which is available in
the project documents file in Africa Information Services Centre. Ihese comments cover the urban
upgrading, housing consolidation and sites and services components.
18. The implementation of the project took over twice as long as anticipated, four and a half years
instead of two. One of the factors which delayed project implementation was the dismissal of the



14-
mnnisr of Works and Housig at the beginning of the project The leadership vacuum thus created
slowed down inidatives in project delivery.
19. The implemention of the infrastucural upgrading component particularly the Nima Stream lining
was adversely affected by the constra that labor intensive methods of construction should be
employed. The performance of the initial contrors were particularly constrained as this job was best
done by mechanical means. These contracts were eventually  rmined and rewarded for execution by
mechanical means after two years of implementation failures.
20. Another constraint was the long time it took for KfW Co-finmcing to become effective
disbursement. The KfW co-financing credit took over eighteen months before it became effective in
June 1990. This contributed to the delay in starting some of the sub projects.
21. Funds provided by GOG for infrastructure on housing consolidation sites arrived late and 50%
short of budgeted amount. The handing over of completed buildings was often delayed by lack of
complementary infrastructural services.
22. With the exception of site consolidation component of site and services most of the physical works
were accomplished as planned. The Nima-west and Ashaiman Upgrading Projects were successfully
accomplished. 200 serviced plots were developed in community 3 Tema and 206 (target 200) housing
units were completed for renting or sale and divestiture. Institutional support was provided to
Technical Services Centre in the areas of vehicles, office equipment, training and financing for project
preparatory studies.
23. Total project cost for Technical Services Center components was US$12.121 million which is
higher than the revised estimates for 1990 (USS$11.7 million) when KfW's participation in the project
took off. The cost overruns arose mainly out of the extended scope of Nima Upgrading project and
extension of project implementation period. Table Al and A2 show details of cost and employment
generation for TSC components. (See report in project file).
24. 2649 jobs were generated at the cost US$4576 per job. Jobs creation fell short SAR expectations
by 43% while cost per increased by 103 %. It appears that original labor targets were too optimistic.
Sustainability
25. The infrastuctural intervention initiated under ADRP have been greedy enbanced under PWP and
are continuing under Urban 1I and will receive furtier attention under the new Local Government
Development Project.
26. Even though the divestiture of 100 completed housing units met with limited success (36 still
unsold as at project completion) it is hoped that the Housing Consolidation Studies funded under the
project will provide a more scientific basis for a future divestiture pmgramme especially now that the
Home Finance Company has become operative.
27. The sites and services project has amply demonstrated that serviced land is an effective stimulus in
the building industry even if it fell short of stimulating low income participation. Success of future
projects will depend on careful site selection and optimization of services.

Findings and Lessons
28. 'he main lessons learned were:
- Co-financing needs of future projects will have to be addressed on a timely basis if
implementation delays are to be avoided.
- Infrasctural needs of future housing projects must be seen as an integral part of such
projects.
- Sites selected for future site and services project must be appropriate for the
target income group.
Future &roect
29. Six studies were commissioned during the life of the Priority Works Project. These
were:
(I)    Suame TJpgrading Project, Kumasi
(ii)    Tamale Urban Development and Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project;
(iii)   Housing Consolidation Studies (Northern Sector)
(iv)   Housing Consolidation Studies (Southern Sector)
(v)    Esereso Site and Services Scheme, Kumasi and
(vi)   Waste Management Studies for Sekondi, Tema and Tamale.
30.  All the studies have been compIeted and (i), (ii) and (vi) are being implemented under
Urban II Project. The rest will be covered under a future urban project.
