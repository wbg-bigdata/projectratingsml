 F. Results Framework Analysis

 Project Development Objectives ()
 According to the Development Credit Agreement (DCA), the project development
 objective (PDO) was to “improve the range of services and economic opportunities
 available to the poorer segments of the population through the carrying out of community
 development, micro-finance and capacity building programs?.

 Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving
 authority)
 There were inconsistencies in the definitions of the PDO in the PAD and in the DCA.
 The original PDO in the PAD which aimed to “further improve access of low income
 groups to basic social services, while providing an example of an effective, efficient, and
 transparent institutional mechanism for providing social services in Yemen by: (i)
 refining social service delivery approaches and (ii) empowering local communities and
 councils to take charge of their local development? was revised to align with the PDO in
 the DCA described above.

   Over the second and third phases of SFD operations, community awareness of SFD interventions grew
 steadily from 62% (IE 2006) to 80% (IE 2010). Cultural heritage (CH) interventions used various tools for
 sensitizing surrounding communities about the significance of historic sites, monuments, etc. Keeping
 mosques open for prayers during restoration increases awareness through works observation and direct
 dialogue. There is systematic dissemination of knowledge about CH interventions (i.e., newsletters, reports,
 publications, etc.). As most CH interventions take place in an urban context, there is a fair level of
 awareness among the population.

1.1 Context at Appraisal
Yemen remains one of the least developed countries in the world and is the poorest
country in the MNA region. In 1998, 42 percent of its 18.5 million people were living
below the poverty line. While Yemen has made some progress towards MDG goals and
in addressing related infrastructure lag in the last decade, basic services coverage is still
insufficient, particularly in rural and remote areas. Gross enrollment for basic education
was 62.5 percent (2004). The quality of education is widely acknowledged to be poor and
the gender gap is among the widest in the world, with only 55 percent of primary school-
aged girls in school. Adult illiteracy rate is 55 percent. While total fertility rate has
decreased to 5.9 births per woman, it continues to fuel a very high population growth rate
of 3.5 percent. Health services cover only 50 percent of the total population and 25
percent in rural areas. Only 69 percent have access to safe drinking water and sanitation.
Yemen’s mountainous geography precludes much of its rural population from accessing
markets and basic services. Efforts to improve livelihoods, especially in rural areas, are
constrained by the lack of access to credit and other financial services. There was limited
coverage and impact of safety net.

The performance of government agencies in charge of delivering basic services and
infrastructure is constrained by weak capacity at the technical, managerial and financial
levels. Local governments lack the capacity to identify problems and needs at local level
and to formulate responsive interventions is limited. There is no government or non-
governmental body that is consistently focusing on building the capacity of civil society
institutions to assess development needs and to identify and implement activities in
communities.

The lack of access to basic services is partly attributed to the weaknesses in state policies,
programs and administrative systems, not least the lack of accountability between
Yemeni citizens and the state and the population’s general exclusion from public policy
and decision-making. The interface between government and citizens is limited. While
there is a critical need to establish basic services in Yemen, it is recognized that short-
term interventions alone will not achieve social development outcomes nor contribute to
the goal of stable society without providing complementary interventions that focus on
improved governance and institutional strengthening.

In 1997, the Social Fund for Development (SFD) was established as an autonomous state
organization to support Government in its efforts to reduce poverty by improving the
access of the poor and low-income groups to basic social and economic services. In a
coordinated approach with several other major donors, the World Bank supported three
phases of SFD operations through SFD1, SFD2 and SFD3, reaching 4.5 million direct
beneficiaries in Phase 2 to over 13.7 million direct beneficiaries by mid-2010.

Phase 1 of SFD (1997-2000) aimed to improve the living conditions and provide income
generating opportunities to the poor by establishing a demand-driven mechanism for

                                              1
providing community development services to poor communities and income generation
activities through the development of small and micro enterprises. This phase focused on
targeting the poor, strengthening institutional capacity of government agencies
(especially outreach capability to poor communities and delivery of small-scale projects);
addressing weaknesses in NGO sector; and supporting the delivery of financial services
for small enterprises.

Phase 2 of SFD (2000-2004) continued to improve the range of services and options
available to the poor population through the implementation of community development,
capacity building and micro finance programs. Special attention was given to further
strengthening community participation; developing socially adapted and sustainable
mechanisms for providing financial services to the poor; improving poverty targeting
mechanisms; refining O&M approaches introduced in Phase 1 to enhance sustainability.

Phase 3 (2004-2010) further improved access of the poor and low income groups to basic
social services, with special focus on empowering local communities and local authorities
to take charge of their local development. Greater focus was given to the institutional
development and empowerment at local level, consolidating micro-finance programs, and
further strengthening the quality of basic services, special programs for social protection,
and coordination with line ministries.

The context at appraisal of SFD3 confirmed that the rationale for Bank involvement
remained strong. SFD is a key pillar of Government’s poverty reduction strategy and for
which Government commitment and support has been sustained throughout its three
phases of operation. The design of the SFD3 was aligned with Government’s Poverty
Reduction Strategy (2001-2005) aimed at promoting economic growth and enhancing the
capacities as well as reducing the suffering and vulnerability of the poor. SFD is a core
component of Government’s Socio-Economic Development Plan for Poverty Reduction
(2006-2010). SFD3 was designed in alignment with the three objectives of the World
Bank’s CAS (2002) focusing on improved governance, strengthening human capital by
expanding access to education and health care services and closing the gender gap, and
ensuring environmental sustainability.

1.2 Objectives Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators
According to the Development Credit Agreement (DCA), the PDO aimed to “improve the
range of services and economic opportunities available to the poorer segments of the
population through the carrying out of community development, micro-finance and
capacity building programs?.

Progress towards the achievement of objectives was to be measured by:
   • At least 40 percent of SFD resources go to the lowest three income deciles.
   • SFD operations cost not to exceed 10 percent of investment cost.
   • 300,000 children enrolled in SFD-built schools.
   • 70-80 percent of SFD supported health facilities and institutions are utilized by
       targeted communities.
   • 240,000 beneficiaries having access to water.

                                             2
    •   760,000 using feeder roads supported by the SFD.
    •   70-80 percent of targeted children are benefitting from SFD supported programs.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification
There were discrepancies in the definition of the PDO in the DCA (see Section 1.2) and
in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD). The PDO in the PAD stated “further improve
access of low income groups to basic social services, while providing an example of an
effective, efficient, and transparent institutional mechanism for providing social services
in Yemen by: (i) refining social service delivery approaches and (ii) empowering local
communities and councils to take charge of their local development?. The PDO in the
PAD was revised to align with the PDO in the DCA at the time when the Additional
Financing was presented to the Board. A Corrigendum to the PAD for SFD3 was
submitted to the Board on June 26, 2009 to revise the PDO accordingly.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
The main project beneficiaries included: students enrolled in basic and secondary
education with a special focus on girls; people with no access to clean drinking water;
communities with no or limited access to primary health care services; individuals with
special needs; rural inhabitants in isolated areas where the price of commodities is high
and access to social services is low; traditional workers and artisans; micro finance (MF)
intermediaries and clients; government institutions, policy makers, and local authorities;
NGO, Cooperatives, Community Based Organizations, and the private sector; and
households severely affected by the global food crisis.

1.5 Original Components 4
Component 1: Community Development (US$374 million, of which US$50 million
from IDA). This component was to support the identification and implementation of
projects for small-scale, demand-driven delivery of social and economic services and
infrastructure, focusing on the six sectors described below. Sub-grants were to be
provided for projects consisting of labor intensive works and the delivery of community
services, implemented by regional authorities, governmental institutions, non-
governmental organizations and local communities.

Education projects were to: (i) expand infrastructure of basic education, including quality
of school buildings; (ii) enhance the formation and functioning of parents’ committees;
and (iii) support the Ministry of Education (MoE) to pilot new approaches for teacher
training in a few urban schools and in pre-school education..

Health projects were to facilitate access to and improve the quality of basic health
services, by addressing, inter alia: shortages in service providers; partnership limitations
in managing services and slow implementation of the district health system; the poor

  Original Components are those described in the DCA which partially differ from those described in the
PAD. According to the PAD, Component 2 refers to “Microenterprise Development? and Component 3
refers to “Capacity Building and Institutional Support?.

                                                  3
quality of the health education system; and critical needs in reproductive health, neonatal
care services, in-service training for health staff, and application of health systems.

Water and Environment projects were to include water harvesting schemes, along with a
hygiene and environmental awareness component; wastewater management, and solid
waste management. Soil and water conservation projects would also be implemented.

Rural Feeder Roads projects were to be implemented, using community contracting
approaches and labor-intensive techniques to facilitate access to services and markets by
rural inhabitants in isolated areas where the price of basic commodities is high and access
to social services is low.

Special Needs Groups 5 projects were to (i) help integrate disadvantaged children into
mainstream education; (ii) train specialized educators for Special Education; (iii) pilot
private sector-NGO partnerships in managing welfare and rehabilitation centers for
children; (iv) explore possibilities for carrying out SFD interventions in the area of
mental disability; and (v) support improvements in the National Sign Language
Dictionary, projects for Early Detection of Disability and Early Intervention, and
development of national strategies (e.g., mother and child, disability).

 Cultural Heritage (CH) projects were to (i) enhance the capacity of organizations and
individuals in documenting, restoring, rehabilitating, and protecting CH assets; (ii)
benefit from international expertise interested in Yemeni CH at the policy and operations
levels; (iii) establish an inventory of Yemeni CH assets; (iv) restore/rehabilitate
threatened CH sites and monuments; and (v) support public awareness efforts regarding
CH.

Component 2: Micro-Finance Schemes (US$6.5 million, of which US$1 million from
IDA). This component was to provide: (i) sub-grants to eligible intermediaries to build
up their institutional capacity to deliver financial services to microenterprises; and (ii)
sub-loans to such intermediaries to carry out micro-finance Sub-projects. This component
was to support the consolidation of past achievements and the transformation of
successful MF programs into sustainable MF institutions, through capacity and institution
building.

Component 3: Capacity Building (US$19.5 million, of which US$9 million from IDA).
This Component was to finance: (i) training activities to support other interventions in
which SFD is involved; and (ii) organizational support, including capacity building,

 Disabled; children-at-risk (orphans, children in conflict with law, street children, children of imprisoned
women; labor children); women-at-risk (women in and coming out of prison); and the socially
marginalized Akhdam (social group in Yemen at the very bottom of the social ladder), institutionalized
psychiatric patients, institutionalized elderly, returnees living in shanty dwellings).




                                                     4
intended to benefit four target groups: NGOs and cooperatives, CBOs, private sector
(consultants), and Local Authorities (elected Local Councils and executive organs).

1.6 Revised Components
In July, 2008, two new components (4 and 5 below) were added to help alleviate the
effects of high food prices on the poor. These components were financed by a Grant of
US$10 million from the Bank’s GFCRP Trust Fund to implement a labor-intensive
workfare program and selected capacity building interventions.

Component 4 on Community-Based Labor Intensive Works (US$9.1 million) was to
support a public workfare program, transferring cash for temporary work to 8,000-10,000
households in the most severely affected communities. It was also to finance
infrastructure in affected communities based on their identified priority needs.

Component 5 on Capacity Building of the Social Welfare Fund (US$0.9 million) was
to finance a national survey to identify the poorest and most vulnerable in society and the
completion of a revised targeting system.

1.7 Other significant changes
European Commission (EC) Trust Fund (TF053450). In 2005, the EC provided a
grant of EUR 7.84 million (US$10.22 million equivalent) via a Bank-administered Trust
Fund to support local development programs, capacity building for local authorities; and
investments in water and roads sector.

Additional Financing. In June 2007, additional financing for an IDA Credit of SDR9.9
million (US$15 million equivalent) was approved to help reduce the financing gap of the
SFD program and allow for continued implementation and scaling up of activities.

Grant from World Bank’s Global Food Crisis Rapid Response (GFCRP) Trust
Fund. The GFCRP Grant was approved in 2008 to help mitigate the effects of global
food price increases on the poor (see Section 1.6).

Extension of Third Phase and the Original IDA Credit. In mid-2008, the original third
phase (2004-2008) was extended by two years (2009-2010). At this time, the original
closing date of the IDA Credit of December 31, 2008 was extended by one year 6 to
provide additional time and resources to implement project activities, while also enabling
SFD to align its efforts with GoY’s Third Five-Year Plan Development Plan/Second
Poverty Reduction Strategy (DPPR, 2006-2010).

Revisions to Key Performance Indicators. At mid-term, SFD and development partners
agreed to revise the Results Framework in order to better capture inputs and outcomes
related to gender and community participation/empowerment as well as to help GoY to
monitor progress of SFD interventions in support of the DPPR and national sector
strategies. The Bank’s Quality of Supervision Assessment (QSA) completed in August

6
  The extension of the closing date of the original project to December 3,1 2009 was aligned with the
closing date of the IDA Additional Financing.

                                                 5
2006 also recommended that suitable indicators be included to better capture the
institutional and empowerment dimensions of SFD3. As a result, the following new
outcome indicators were added.

   •   50-60 percent of participating households confirming that women/girls in their
       household directly benefitted from the project;
   •   60-70 percent of households confirming that the subproject implemented reflects
       a community priority;
   •   increased enrollment rate in basic education by 7 percent for boys and girls in the
       areas of SFD intervention; and
   •   40-50 percent of micro finance savers/borrowers confirming an improvement in
       their household living standards.

Empowerment for Local Development Program (ELDP). Drawing on its ten years
experience working at the decentralized level, SFD developed the pilot phase of ELDP,
supporting communities to lead their own development, strengthening links with district
authorities, and re-balancing the planning process from top-down to bottom-up. The
outcomes of this pilot have guided the scaling up of the ELD model under the fourth
phase of the Social Development Fund (SFD4) and for which an IDA Grant was
approved in March 2010.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
There was no Quality Enhancement Review (QER). In hindsight, the QER could have
provided upfront guidance in identifying suitable outcome and intermediate indicators to
assess performance related to the institutional development, empowerment, and gender
dimensions of SFD3, important areas which the Quality Supervision Assessment (QSA)
identified as requiring more attention. These limitations were subsequently addressed
during implementation.

Ownership and participation from Government. GoY’s strong commitment and
ownership were reflected in its involvement in all aspects of SFD3 design, integrating
lessons learned from the previous operations, while also striving to create a center of
excellence in the SFD agency. GoY almost doubled its planned contribution to SFD3
from the original commitment of US$40 million to US$65.5 million at the time of the
ICR mission. SFD continued to enjoy its autonomous status. Chaired by the Prime
Minister, SFD’s Board included high-level officials from Government and
representatives from NGOs and private sectors.

Preparation was highly participatory. SFD3 was prepared in consultation with
beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries, NGOs, cooperatives, government authorities at
central, sector, and local levels, and development partners. The outcomes of these
consultations were incorporated in project design, setting program priorities, refining
participatory approaches, and revising the Operations Manual and other technical


                                            6
manuals. Consultations helped validate the project development objectives, core
interventions, and the roles of stakeholders during implementation.

Experience and lessons learned from the previous phase were integrated in project
design, including, inter alia:: (i) the importance of continuing to refine participatory
approaches used by SFD, taking into account SFD’s evolving portfolio; (ii) the
importance of decentralizing SFD regional offices and building their operational
decision-making capacity to strengthen the efficiency by which program interventions are
implemented and delivered; (iii) the importance of enhancing the institutional capacities
of local communities and local governments not just to implement projects but to
empower them to lead their local development process; (iv) strengthening collaboration
and synergies between SFD and line ministries which have the mandate to deliver basic
services; (v) the importance of only supporting health infrastructure improvement in
functioning health facilities; (vi) the need to strengthen institutional development of
micro finance providers and wherever feasible, to help consolidate microfinance
programs to ensure sustainability; and (vii) focusing on rainwater harvesting schemes
rather than mechanized groundwater abstraction systems.

Project design supported national/sector strategies. SFD3 interventions were designed
in line with national/sector strategies and plans. SFD supported line ministries in
improving sector performance, promoting the cost-effective and participatory delivery of
basic services; strengthening capacity for implementation; and contributing to the
development of policies and strategies. Project design also incorporated capacity building
and organizational support for local government, which helped to promote good
governance and to activate local development with participation of local communities.

Effective Institutional/Implementation Mechanisms. The design of the third phase
incorporated cost-effective, transparent and participatory mechanisms, international and
local best practices, and robust capacity building - key factors that have enabled SFD to
efficiently expand outreach, scale up results, and widen partnerships in development.

2.2 Implementation
Shortfall in Funding of SFD’s Program. The total cost of SFD’s Program was
estimated at US$400 million, of which the IDA contribution was estimated at US$60
million. At the time of the Board approval of the IDA Credit, approximately
US$180million (which included the IDA Credit) had been secured, resulting in a shortfall
in financing for the Program of about US$220 million which was substantially reduced
during implementation. However, the extension of the third phase of the Program to
cover the period 2009-2010 required an additional US$564 million, bringing the total
resource requirement for the extended phase of the Program (2004-2010) to US$963
million against which donors, including GoY, committed to provide close to US$910
million. By August 2010, US$693.5 million had been made available; the remaining
US$216 million is yet to be released. Based on this, the projected shortfall in funding for
the Program is estimated at US$53.5 million (see Annex 1).




                                            7
Development of SFD Mid-Term Vision. In 2006, SFD developed its Mid-Term Vision
focusing on poverty alleviation and capacity building of partner institution, with focus
on: (i) empowerment of communities and promoting local development; (ii) expanding
economic activities; (iii) strengthening local and national institutions and partners; and
(iv) strengthening internal synergies and enhancing efficiency and capacity within SFD.
While these are not new, SFD aimed to further refine approaches and enhance
mechanisms to increase its efficiency, focusing on long-term community empowerment,
fostering community linkages with local authorities, intensifying its technical capacity
building of local authorities, and supporting eligible projects proposed in participatory
development plans at the district level. These refinements were introduced in the third
phase and also incorporated in the design of the fourth phase (SFD4).

Implementation Support to Special Programs. Although not part of the original project,
SFD implemented special programs 7 based on its experience with similar activities and
its comparative advantage. These programs focused on: (i) helping to promote
agricultural and livestock SMEs, by providing outreach services, including capacity
building, to marginalized communities to improve their living conditions; and (ii)
supporting a labor-intensive public workfare program that provides cash for temporary
work. This is now being scaled up under SFD4.

Re-alignment of SFD support for water projects with water sector policies. The
design of the water and environment sub-components envisaged the construction of water
harvesting schemes based on open public cisterns. In practice, the water quality from
many of these open cisterns was lower than anticipated, and did not meet national water
supply standards that were set midway through the third phase. As a result, the SFD
water harvesting policy was changed to promote protected water supplies wherever
possible, either through the provision of covered public water cisterns or through private
rooftop rainwater harvesting tanks.

SFD policy changes have ensured that its interventions are in accord with national
strategies and standards. The designs and outcomes of the water harvesting schemes are
now accepted and approved by both the Ministry of Water and Environment and the
General Authority for Rural Water Supply and Sanitation (GARWSS). Most of surface
water harvesting cisterns are now covered; increasing emphasis is being given to rooftop
rainwater harvesting schemes; and design criteria for water harvesting schemes have been
upgraded 8 in line with national standards for improved water supply.

Community contribution to water projects. Water supply remains a high priority for
rural communities in Yemen. However, the significant community contributions required

7
  These included: (i) GoY’s Labor Intensive Works (LIW) Program; (ii) European Commission Food
Facility Grant (ESSNEP) to support ongoing workfare program; (iii) World Bank GFCRP Grant for
workfare program; and (iv) a major component of the Rain-fed Agricultural and Livestock Project
supported by the World Bank and IFAD.

 Provides for minimum of 3 liters per person per day with maximum return trip collection not exceed 30
minutes.

                                                  8
for rainwater harvesting projects, and the lack of technology options 9 appropriate to
coastal areas, reduced demand for SFD water schemes. A recent reduction in the level of
community contribution for water schemes from 30 percent to 5 percent as found in other
SFD projects, and the acceptance of mechanized water schemes in coastal areas with
sustainable groundwater resources, are expected to redress these demand constraints.

Microenterprise Development. The Small and Medium Enterprise Promotion Services
(SMEP) was established in 2006. SMEP is the first national microenterprise agency in
Yemen that provides consultative services to small enterprises to enhance their profits,
maximize competitiveness, and achieve sustainable growth. During implementation, Law
No. 15 on Micro Finance Banks was enacted, allowing the establishment in rural areas of
Greenfield microfinance banks that can take savings, an important source of funds for on-
lending, and for commercial banks to engage in microfinance activities.

Community Contracting. Community contracting was used for water and roads projects,
enabling communities to directly contract local suppliers in a transparent manner, elect
committee members, post financial records in public spaces, and hold community
meetings – factors that can give credibility to the elected committees, encourage
households to make a contribution, and help mitigate risks associated with potential
opposition to the project. There were concerns regarding the requirement for higher
community contributions under community contracting. To address these concerns, SFD
has recently adopted a unified approach which limits community contribution to 5
percent; this requirement is waived for poor/low-income households which are not able to
contribute. This approach is expected to be fully implemented during the fourth phase
(SFD4).

Piloting innovations. SFD implemented innovative pilots 10 that have the potential for
scaling up, with consideration given to the following factors: (i) where feasible,
strengthening complementarity between pilot activities and ongoing support being
provided in the same or related sectors in which there was SFD involvement; (ii) ensuring
upfront coordination with relevant line ministries; (iii) ensuring satisfactory outcomes
from the pilot and demonstrating their potential for sustaining investments prior to
scaling up; (iv) systematic twinning of investments with capacity building; and (v)
incorporating lessons in the design for scaling up. (See Annex 2)

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E Design, Implementation and Utilization)
Design. M&E design focused on assisting SFD staff to consistently follow up on the
subprojects they implemented, further enhancing SFD’s management information system
(MIS) and conducting field surveys and studies for data collection and analysis, with the

9
 Gravity water systems require water sources above the community (e.g., from a spring, cistern or dam)
Recognizing that rainwater harvesting is not applicable and that springs are not available in coastal areas,
SFD has developed a policy for intervening in mechanized water systems.

10
 Pilots focused on: (i) Rural Girls’ Education; (ii) Education Quality Program; (iii) Empowerment for
Local Development; (iv) Community-Led Sanitation; and (v) Integrated Interventions Program.


                                                     9
goal of evaluating the outcomes, efficiency, and impact of subprojects on target groups.
Design included activities to build capacity of stakeholders to monitor and evaluate the
performance and results of their respective projects. The PAD foresaw the following
areas of intervention: (i) carrying out evaluation surveys and impact studies of all SFD
programs through its Programming Unit; (ii) systematizing M&E activities at the level of
program units and documenting lessons learned; (iii) capacity building for M&E; (iv)
carrying out external evaluations of SFD’s innovative programs; and (v) facilitating
communications and marketing of SFD’s accomplishment, following the completion of
impact evaluations. One shortcoming relates to the development of the Results
Framework in which some performance indicators were either not clearly defined or have
proven difficult to measure. The Results Framework was subsequently revised during
implementation. On balance, M&E design for SFD3 is deemed to be Satisfactory overall.

Implementation and Utilization. Requirements for M&E systems were addressed in
project design and M&E activities were implemented in an efficient manner. Although
the Results Framework in the PAD was limited in identifying suitable outcome indicators
on the institutional development, empowerment, and gender dimensions of the Project’s
objectives, these were subsequently corrected. While not reported in the PAD, the ICR
notes that SFD regularly undertook “expanded? monitoring and evaluation of its
activities using both quantitative and qualitative methods. The Project has earned a
Satisfactory rating in this category.

SFD’s M&E system provided for regular information flows between SFD and
stakeholders (i.e., communities, district, sector ministries, partners and policy makers).
This was supported by a decentralized and integrated MIS incorporating operational data
and tools for analysis. The MIS supported several functions including reporting and
analysis; targeting; monitoring, management and decision making; financial
management; and procurement management. Work is underway to fully integrate the
Geographical Information System 11 data base in the MIS. Within the framework of the
project cycle, the MIS provided data on inputs, outputs, outcomes and impact indicators,
with disaggregation of social indicators by gender. The implementation of a diverse set of
M&E activities has served to increase accountability to stakeholders.

Household surveys were implemented to monitor and assess the impact of access to,
availability, and utilization of services, including changes in living conditions resulting
from SFD interventions. Assessments on project performance and achievements were
carried out each year; an external evaluation was conducted at mid-term; and impact
evaluations took place every three years. Sector-specific or thematic studies/assessments
were conducted to draw lessons from pilots, refine approaches, and guide the process for
scaling up.

   The GIS facilitates the targeting of SFD interventions and monitoring and assessment of poverty indicators and
provides SFD with the means to prioritize applications to the poorest areas with the least access to services delivery.
The GIS hosts information from various consensus and social survey, with potential to also include information from
PRAs.



                                                         10
2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
Safeguard Policies. The QSA (2006) recommended that a policy framework be
established to address potential land acquisition issues. Although the safeguard policy on
resettlement was not triggered, SFD had a clear land acquisition policy and through its
project approval/screening processes ensured that project funds were not used for land
acquisition.

Financial Management (FM). SFD’s overall performance in the area of financial
management is deemed to be Satisfactory. SFD maintained its own (well-developed)
Financial Manual that is updated when necessary. The computerized accounting system
of SFD enabled the timely preparation of quarterly interim financial reports, while
ensuring the integrity of the data through its security features. SFD’s Finance
Management Unit and Internal Audit Unit were adequately staffed with qualified
individuals and there was no staff turnover during the life of the project. Like the
procurement module, the FM module was integrated in the MIS, facilitating effective
planning and decision making. Annual financial audits were carried out efficiently and
submitted to the Bank almost always in advance of the deadline. All the audits were
found to be unqualified.

Procurement. Given its experience in past operations and the very good procurement
systems and processes, SFD’s capacity for managing and implementing procurement
activities is overall high. Procurement activities were implemented efficiently and in a
transparent manner, ensuring compliance with the DCA and SFD’s Operational Manual.
Monitoring and contract management systems for works, good and services have been
incorporated in SFD’s integrated MIS. Ex-post annual procurement audits and an
independent technical audit were carried out to confirm that procurement activities
satisfied all criteria of transparency. SFD’s Management engaged key donors to jointly
approve a set of harmonized Standard Bidding Documents for use in all local open
bidding processes. During the third phase, community contracting has been widely used
for the Community Development Program and the Labor-Intensive Works Program. The
Manual for Community Contracting was further strengthened to reflect experience and
lessons from the pilot. The Regional Branch Offices have built sufficient capacity that
now enable them to fully manage community contracting. SFD is leading the process of
building capacity for procurement at community and decentralized levels following best
practices.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase.
Operations and Maintenance. SFD does not finance a project unless there is a strong
indication that the project will continue to function after its involvement. SFD ensures
that projects reflect community priorities, that communities participate in the project
cycle, and that line ministries agree upfront to provide the necessary inputs to make
constructed and/or rehabilitated projects operational. SFD undertakes regular visits to
completed projects for two years to ensure that O&M activities are being done and where
O&M issues have been identified, that actions are taken. Capacity building is provided to
local authorities to improve local planning and budgeting to facilitate regular O&M of
SFD projects.


                                           11
O&M performance of SFD-assisted subprojects has steadily improved since the first
phase. There is a high degree of ownership of projects in SFD-supported communities
where the maintenance of projects in education (99 percent); health (98 percent), water
(95 percent); and roads (89 percent) sectors are deemed to be adequate or excellent (IE,
2010). Notwithstanding, there is still a need for further improvement.

Capacity building is at the core of SFD interventions. Interventions at all levels and
across all sectors covered by SFD are systematically twinned with various forms of
capacity building to facilitate participation, transfer of skills and know-how, and promote
ownership and sustainability. SFD is the only organization in Yemen that is providing a
diverse program of capacity building at community and decentralized levels nationwide.
Participatory methodologies that underpin SFD’s community development approach are
contributing to laying the foundation for communities to become active partners
alongside districts and governorates. Training of district councils and governorates to
build their capacity for participatory planning and local development is enabling them to
more effectively assume their assigned responsibilities and mandates in the
decentralization process.

Follow-on Operation: The fourth phase, Social Development Fund Phase IV Project
(SFD4) which aims to further improve access to basic services, enhance economic
opportunities, and reduce vulnerability of the poor was approved by the Board of the
World Bank in March 30, 2010 and became effective on October 7, 2010.

3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
Rating: Satisfactory
The Project’s development objective remains highly relevant to Yemen’s development
priorities. In support of Yemen’s Third Five-Year Development Plan for Poverty
Reduction Strategy (DPPR, 2006-2010), SFD3 directly contributed to the national goals
of reducing poverty, achieving Yemen’s MDGs, and social protection for the poor and
vulnerable by supporting access to social services and economic opportunities, while
strengthening the capacity of stakeholders to participate in development efforts. Project
design reflected SFD’s evolution in supporting GoY’s poverty reduction initiatives and in
broadening the base of beneficiaries of social and economic change with the most cost-
efficient apparatus. Drawing on its comparative advantage in supporting institutional
development and capacity building at all levels of governance and government, including
within technical departments of line ministries, governorates, districts, and local
communities, SFD was able to affect positive changes, maximize benefits from
investments, and scale-up results that contribute to Yemen’s development process.

The Community Development Component was designed to support the identification and
implementation of demand-driven projects to improve the delivery of social and
economic services, using participatory methodologies and bottom-up approaches with
communities identifying their development priorities. Projects funded by SFD were

                                            12
grounded on principles that promoted transparency, cost-effectiveness, institutional
development and the empowerment of local communities and local authorities to take
charge of their local development.

The Microenterprise Development Component supported capacity building and
institutional development of micro finance (MF) programs, while working towards the
consolidation and gradual transformation of promising programs into MFIs. MF
programs provided financial services (loans, savings) to low-income clients, especially
women, to improve their living standards and increase their income/economic activity.

The Capacity Building and Institutional Support Component supported various capacity
building/training interventions and organizational support to facilitate the transfer of
skills and know-how to various groups of stakeholders, while also strengthening
institutional structures, systems, and processes for participatory development.
Interventions promoted participatory planning for local development, enabling
communities to become active partners alongside district and governorates; helped build
the organizational skills of NGOs for services delivery; and by providing technical
assistance to address sector requirements, strengthened the capacity of implementing
units/technical departments of line ministries to efficiently carry out their mandates.

The Community-Based Labor-Intensive Works Component was designed to provide cash
for work to help bridge consumption gaps of households affected by the global food crisis.
Lessons from this first round of implementation have guided the design for scaling up
coverage under SDF4. The Capacity Building of the Social Welfare Fund Component
implemented selected capacity building activities to improve targeting, program
expansion, and program effectiveness in reducing poverty.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
Rating: Satisfactory
As of August 31, 2010, SFD’s portfolio included 6,971 multi-sector projects which are
intended to benefit 20,354,000 individuals (85 percent of the population). Of these
planned projects, 4,461 have been completed, providing direct benefits to over
13,700,000 individuals; 2,510 are under implementation. SFD’s portfolio included
projects that were: (i) envisaged in the original design of SFD3 (4,193); (ii) scaled up in
the extended phase (2,436); and (iii) implemented under other special programs (342).
Projects in the original third phase have been substantially completed (98 percent).

Component 1: Community Development

Targeting resources to benefit the poor. A key objective of SFD phase III is that at least
40% of its resources go to the lowest three income deciles. The 2006 impact evaluation
used reported incomes. However, the 2010 impact evaluation used a Proxy Means Test
(PMT) model that predicted consumption deciles to measure the targeting accuracy of the
program, because a national Household Budget Survey data was not available in
2009/2010. As it would be inaccurate to use these consumption based findings against


                                            13
the stated income deciles based indicator, the 2010 IE recommended to conduct a study
that measures the actual performance of SFD targeting.

A recent study by Leite (2010) has shown that there are some measurement and
methodological issues on measuring targeting performance. First, the choice of indicator
itself is found to be inappropriate, given that the SFD targeting process for community
development programs (70-75% of its budget) is based on geographical targeting, while
the indicator measures household-level targeting. For the two to be aligned, certain
conditions need to prevail in terms of poverty distribution across communities and within
communities, making the indicator an imperfect measure of the actual targeting
performance of SFD interventions. Secondly, different methodology and data sources
were chosen to assess targeting of the Community Development Program. Leite (2010)
argues that for sound methodological reasons the household income deciles and the PMT
deciles are not directly comparable. If the latter are to be used to measure SFD's poverty
targeting performance at the household level, then it is more appropriate to rely on the
PMT within its intended thresholds rather than to apply simple deciles and report results
as if the two are equivalent. This ICR report thus also reports the Leite (2010) findings
using the same 2010 Impact Evaluation PMT findings, but placing them in the intended
poverty cutoffs. According to this analysis SFD targeting is still strongly pro-poor: 30%
of SFD resources go to the extreme poor, 54% to both extreme and moderate poor, and
79% to all poor households. (See Annex 3B for more detailed explanation on targeting
outcomes.)

Alignment between SFD projects and Community Priorities. Through the use of
participatory methodologies, SFD was able to align its interventions with the priority
needs of the community. Impact Evaluation (2010) shows that the majority of
respondents (90 percent) agree that SFD projects reflected community priorities and that
they would select the projects again. Direct community involvement in projects was
relatively high – male and female members participated in meetings where the project
was selected and after selection, many communities established their own organization
process to support project implementation. Respondents perceive most of beneficiary
committees to be effective (84 percent); and there has been relatively high maintenance
of projects ranging from 89 percent for roads projects to 95 percent and above for water,
education and health projects (IE, 2010). An analysis of SFD MIS data indicates that the
majority of beneficiary communities (over 95 percent) 12 have contributed in cash or in
kind to the total cost of subprojects.

Maintaining low operational costs. Through the systematic application of cost-effective
measures, SFD was able to maintain its operational cost at 4.7 percent.


12
  In the following cases, however, communities were exempted from contributing: (i) very poor and low-
income households which are not able to contribute; and (ii) subprojects (e.g., street pavements)
implemented in urban areas where communities are not homogeneous, and requesting in-kind
contributions is problematic due to the lack of stones and soil (which is usually the type of contribution
provided in rural areas). In urban areas, local authorities have contributed towards the cost of several
subprojects that were implemented in urban areas.

                                                   14
Increases in enrollment rates in basic education, especially for girls. SFD built,
rehabilitated and equipped 11,348 classrooms, providing close to 628,600 student places
of which 42 percent are for females. The Impact Evaluation (2010) shows that from 2006
to 2010, enrollment rates in SFD beneficiary communities increased by 14.4 percent on
average across boys and girls age 6-14 years (6 percent for boys and 27 percent for girls).
Moreover, in communities where SFD supported mixed schools and girls’ schools,
enrollment in 2010 for girls was 11.2 percent and 20.4 percent higher, respectively; the
net impact of SFD interventions on girls’ enrollment rates is estimated at 12.8 percent in
girls’ schools and 3.5 percent in mixed schools. These findings illustrate the high degree
of effectiveness and the strong pay-off from SFD investments in increasing access to
education overall, and increasing female participation, in particular. At the national level,
gross enrollment rate (GER) in basic education increased from 62.5 percent to 68.4
percent over the school year period of 2003/4 to 2009/10. GER increased from 70.9
percent to 73.9 percent for boys and from 53.4 percent to 62.4 percent for girls. Of the
total 39,887 classrooms built during the period 2004-2009, 30 percent were financed by
SFD, a significant contribution to the national stock of education infrastructure and to
achieving EFA goals and MDGs.

SFD’s contributions to expanding access have not been systematically matched with
adequate resources to cover operational/recurrent expenditures. Shortage of books, lack
of water/toilets and female teachers, and poor quality of teaching contribute to low
student satisfaction (42 percent); in SFD-supported schools, student satisfaction is
slightly higher (IE 2010). Although not directly the responsibility of the SFD, these
shortcomings undermine SFD’s significant investments in achieving development
impacts in education.

SFD infrastructure projects were implemented alongside investments in quality
enhancing inputs that promoted an enabling environment for learning. With SFD’s
support, the school mapping exercise was completed in all governorates, resulting in
better planning for school construction, the Measurement and Evaluation Center of the
Ministry of Education (MoE) was established, and technical assistance was provided to
assist the Ministry in addressing different aspects of the education process. SFD
implemented several pilots 13 , the outcomes of which are now guiding discussions to
identify options for mainstreaming approaches and/or scale-up interventions.

Increased access and utilization of health services. SFD3 implemented a total of 428
projects to improve coverage and quality of basic health services and enhance health
system performance and human resources management to help achieve health-related

13
  These include, inter alia: i) education equality program, a comprehensive approach to increasing girls’
enrollment and quality enhancing approaches to strengthen teacher effectiveness and enhance student
learning outcomes; ii) pre-school education program supported physical infrastructure and capacity
building on new curriculum for pre-school teachers; and iii) support for the gifted and talented.




                                                   15
MDGs. Close to 2700 trainees benefitted from pre-service training of which 75 percent
were female health workers. Training of female health workers, the majority of whom
were midwives was strengthened to increase support to women in remote and rural areas
in reproductive and primary health care. To improve the educational qualifications of
health staff, curricula for training courses, capacity of teaching cadre, laboratories and
libraries of health management institutions have been upgraded. In-service training was
provided to staff of psychiatric hospitals and care centers. Capacity of local councils to
manage the health district system has been strengthened. SFD3 supported infrastructure
improvements and equipment for existing primary health care facilities that were
functional. Maternal and child health centers, including emergency obstetric units, were
constructed and equipped. SFD supported the development of the national strategy for
mental health, including the operational plan (2011-2015) and provided training to
medical/assistant staff to enable them to provide mental health services within the
framework of primary health care.

The Impact Evaluation (2010) shows that in SFD communities: (i) utilization rates for
pre-natal care rose from 15 percent to 62 percent; (ii) the probability of women from the
poorest household consumption decile to seek health care when ill increased from 48
percent to 84 percent; (iii) women are twice as likely to be assisted by a community
midwife; and (iv) 64 percent of respondents believe that access to health care has
improved due to SFD interventions.

Increased access to water and improvements in hygiene and sanitation. The original
target of completing 750 water harvesting project was ambitious when compared to the
actual experience of completing only 58 water harvesting projects per year for the period
2002-2006. During the MTR, a joint decision was taken to reduce the targets to 60
projects per year. However, given that the average size of water projects had been larger
than originally planned, it was expected that more individuals would benefit. The
majority of water projects were implemented using community contracting; 465 projects
were completed, benefitting almost 1,394,500 individuals. About 74 percent of water
projects utilized rainwater harvesting, one of the few sustainable and low-cost rural water
supply options available in water-scarce Yemen. Fifty-two percent of households report
reduced time to collect water during the rainy season (with women benefitting the most);
average travel time is reduced within 30 minutes per round trip (IE, 2010).

Long debates between SFD, the Ministry of Water and Environment (MoWE), and the
General Authority for Rural Water Supply and Sanitation (GARWSS) on appropriateness
of SFD’s rainwater harvesting scheme (previously not endorsed by MoWE/GARWSS)
and use of mechanized borehole systems (resisted by SFD) have now been concluded.
Both sides now appreciate the value of rainwater harvesting schemes in some areas (e.g.,
where rainwater provides the only sustainable water source or where there is a demand
for a low-cost solution from rural communities). Also, there is appreciation of the
importance of having alternative supply options (e.g., mechanized borehole systems) in
other areas.




                                            16
Over 60 environmental sanitation projects 14 and 370 environmental and hygiene
awareness campaigns have been completed. SFD introduced hygiene and environmental
education campaigns for water harvesting projects to improve their cost-effectiveness
while also increasing health benefits.

SFD3 implemented innovative and sustainable technologies and approaches, including
re-using traditional rooftop rainwater harvesting tanks, and the introduction of
community-led total sanitation. Other agencies are now undertaking similar interventions
using the models developed by SFD.

Utilization of Feeder Roads. SFD financed the lowest category of roads 15 for which no
government jurisdiction assumed responsibility, focusing primarily on linking isolated
areas to markets and services. It assisted adjoining villages to explore cost and design
options and the types of labor and materials needed for works, SFD also trained
beneficiary communities, engineers, technicians and SFD Branch staff on community
contracting, and provided technical assistance to support the development of selection
criteria to guide policies for higher level roads program in order to link main roads
networks (and markets) to current feeder roads. A total of 2100 km of protected/improved
roads and 2,016,871m2 of paved streets in urban areas were completed, benefitting close
to 1,366,800 individuals and generating 6,351,400 work days.

SFD has made important contributions to increasing access to markets and basic services.
The Impact Evaluation (2010) shows that in SFD-supported communities, travel time to
markets was reduced on average by 43 minutes; 75 percent of respondents indicate that
roads have provided economic benefits (i.e., reduced time and cost of travel; better access
to commodities, and savings on better transport of commodities); the average cost of one
trip per beneficiary was reduced from YER 419 to YER 357. Most respondents (91
percent) agree that the selection of roads project was a priority for the community; 85%
found the works to be acceptable; and over 80 percent report that the projects have
contributed to improvements in their overall life situation.

Support for Special Needs Group (SNG). SFD had a strong focus on inclusive education
for children with disabilities - promoting participatory approaches, engaging families as
advocates for the rights of their children with disabilities, and improving the
sustainability of facilities and programs through training and capacity building of
individuals to qualify them to deliver inclusive education services. Social care and
educational facilities were built and equipped, community-based rehabilitation centers
were established to further expand outreach in rural areas, and teachers and physicians
serving these centers were trained. SFD interventions provided direct benefits to 19,324
disadvantaged students who have been integrated in 244 SFD-supported public schools.

SFD supported mainstream institutions to strategically address issues on SNGs. It helped
develop the National Strategy for Children and Youth, the National Strategy for the
Disabled, the Social Protection Strategy; a vision paper for caring and rehabilitation of

14
     These included wastewater management, solid waste management and soil and water conservation schemes.
15
     These include village access roads that often times are little more than dirt tracks.

                                                         17
the disabled; and the strategy for the Disability Welfare and Rehabilitation Fund, a key
instrument for implementing national strategies relating to disability and social protection.
SFD established a resource center at a national university for early childhood
development and supported key national workshops to build advocacy and raise
awareness on SNGs (Middle East Disability Surveillance Initiative, First National
Conference for Autism).

Preservation of Yemen’s cultural heritage (CH). SFD completed 105 projects which
included capacity building for close to 1660 master builders and 436 architects and the
restoration, conservation and documentation of Yemen’s cultural heritage assets. A data
base to help track inventory of cultural assets was established. SFD’s collaboration with
several ministries has been productive, leading to: (i) endorsement of SFD’s vision and
strategic interventions to preserve Yemen’s cultural heritage by the Ministry of Culture;
(ii) agreement of the Ministry of Higher Education to integrate special courses on
preserving cultural sites in the curriculum of national universities at undergraduate and
post-graduate levels; and (iii) establishment of a special department for Historic Mosques
in the Ministry of Endowments. Specialized courses and workshops were implemented to
enable professionals and decision makers to increase their awareness and knowledge of
conservation of cultural sites. Strengthening synergies with other SFD units, the CH Unit
collaborated with the SMED/SMEPS Unit and the Training and Organizational Support
Unit to prepare the “Development of Cultural Industries Project?, a pilot which aims to
improve the livelihoods of the poor by providing economic opportunities to market
traditional handicrafts. SFD also secured Yemen’s accession to the International Center
for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property.

Integrated Intervention Program (IIP). SFD implemented 154 multi-sectoral projects
with the overall aim of achieving higher development impact in some of the poorest sub-
districts in the country through the implementation of integrated activities, rather than
stand-alone individual projects. The IIP covers eight of the poorest and most
underdeveloped uslas (sub-districts) in eight governorates and continues to be
implemented through SFD’s regional branch offices.

The IIP model provides sustained inputs over a number of years to remote and
marginalized communities to lead and manage their own development. It has been
effective in motivating, training, and mobilizing communities to prioritize their needs,
plan their own development, and create representative structures and relationships within
and between communities. Overarching committees as well as sector specific
committees in areas such as health, education, and literacy have been established to plan,
manage and monitor community development. Communities are running schools, piped
water systems and literacy classes and there appears to be a correlation between provision
of water and enrolment of girls in schools and women in literacy classes.

The implementation of the IIP model helps to: (i) sustain community development
committees, including their transition to registered community based organizations; (ii)
deepen the engagement of women in the development process; (iii) build social cohesion
and trust among communities; (iv) build the capacity of communities to manage basic


                                             18
services; and (v) manage relationships with district authorities (Institutional Impact
Evaluation, 2009). The scaling up of IIP interventions in additional rural areas with
linkages established between communities and local councils/local authorities at the
district level is now being considered under the fourth phase.

Component 2: Micro-Enterprise Development. This component provided microfinance
through intermediaries, while also building and consolidating their capacity to provide
high quality services and achieve operational, financial and institutional sustainability.
SFD supported ten microfinance (MF) programs serving around 56,000 borrowers and
51,700 savers of which 75 percent are women. Of the ten programs, eight are
operationally sustainable and one is financially sustainable. For the majority of the micro-
finance institutions (MFIs), the average portfolio at risk (PAR) >30 days was under 2
percent compared to the target of under five percent. SFD also supported the quasi-
governmental small business lending agency – SEDF 16, with loan funds and technical
assistance benefitting 2,566 borrowers.

The Impact Evaluation (2010) reveals that loans provided by SFD MFIs allowed over 50
percent of recipients to increase their income and economic activity; the majority of
income-generating loan recipients have increased their economic activity (85 percent).
Beneficiaries were able to engage in new economic activities (65 percent); increase their
income (90 percent); use loans to send their children to school (19 percent); and make
improvements to their houses (82 percent). Women (the majority of MFI clients)
expressed a high level of satisfaction with MF programs, recognizing several benefits
from their participation, namely: greater independence and self-confidence, greater
respect and decision making in the household, improved economic situation, and the
opportunity to have a home-based job that allows them to contribute to the family well-
being (Micro Finance Gender Impact Study, 2008).

A major long-term achievement of SFD/SMED with regard to sustainable MF sector
development was the passage of Law No. 15 on MF Banks in April 2009, allowing for
deposit-taking MF institutions and enabling new private sector players to enter the market,
licensed and regulated by the Central Bank of Yemen.

SFD/SMED’s strategy of merger and consolidation of MFIs was successful overall.
Three programs in Aden were merged into one MFI which is now merging with its ‘sister’
in Abyan, creating one strong sustainable MFI in the South. The ‘ASA’ programs became
the National Microfinance Foundation (NMF), the largest MFI and a strong institution
which is expected to transform into a licensed micro-finance bank. The Hodeidah
program took over good clients of the two small programs (Beit Al Fakieh, Hais), which
were closed down because they were too small to survive. Due to persistent and recurrent
loan officer fraud, the Hodeidah program as a whole failed and SMED stopped
supporting this program, albeit after it had ensured that good clients would remain served.

                                            19
SFD established the Small and Micro-Enterprise Promotion Agency (SMEPS) to provide
specialized business development services for entrepreneurs. During its short existence,
the agency has carried out a number of successful projects 17 which have contributed
greatly to the development of the sector.

Capacity Building and Institutional Support. This component completed 1,152
projects to support the implementation of activities under the first two components of
SFD3, benefitting over 1,000,000 stakeholders. These projects focused on (i) building the
capacity of various stakeholders, and providing them with the tools to participate in
development activities for services delivery; (ii) promoting partnerships between
communities and local authorities for the prioritization and implementation of local
development plans (e.g., ELD program pilot which is now being scaled up under SFD4);
and (iii) strengthening the capacity of line ministries for policy development, effective
implementation of sector strategies, including reforms, and decentralized delivery of
quality basic services. SFD supported continuous capacity building of its staff, with high
pay-offs that enabled SFD as a whole to expand its portfolio and scale up results.

Component on Labor-Intensive Works Program. SFD implemented the Labor-
Intensive Works (LIW) Program financed by the World Bank Global Food Price Crisis
Response Program (GFPCRP) to help mitigate the effects of food price increases on the
poor (see Section 1.6). This program financed 98 LIW projects, primarily in the roads
and water sectors, providing temporary jobs to 36,000 people and benefitting 16,824
households. A total of US$6.6 million has been paid in wages corresponding to 899,361
days worked. The majority of beneficiary households (94 percent) used the funds to
bridge their consumption gap. The results of this program helped the country to mobilize
more funds from other donors such as EU and DFID, who are currently supporting the
program. The LIW Program is being scaled up under SFD4 and the lessons learned from
these earlier program interventions are continuously being incorporated for improvement
in sub-project design and the management of the program.

3.3 Efficiency
SFD’s Management Information System (MIS) indicates that SFD3 has been a least cost
vehicle for delivering basic services in Yemen due to its clear and transparent fiduciary
procedures and participatory methodologies. An analysis of MIS data indicates the
following efficiencies: (i) There is some evidence that projects financed by the SFD can
be more cost-effective than similar projects financed by GoY. For example, the
construction costs under SFD3 were even lower than the construction costs under similar
programs in Yemen. (ii) SFD interventions have had important impacts on human
development indicators (i.e., expansion/rehabilitation of classrooms contributed to

17
  Examples include highly informative value-chain analyses undertaken in a variety of agricultural sub-
sectors (honey, coffee, fish) outlining bottlenecks and opportunities for small producers in the whole
supply-to-demand chain in these sub-sectors. The honey value chain analysis resulted in a coffee growing
improvement project for women in Taiz, ensuring higher quality and international quality certification.




                                                  20
increased enrollment rates, especially for girls; improvements in access and quality of
health facilities had led to increased utilization of heath care services; water interventions
combined with hygiene and sanitation activities have promoted better health).

While the scope and coverage of SFD interventions have significantly increased during
the last decade, SFD has maintained its operational cost at 4.7 percent. With its robust
capacity building program, transparent policies, and proven systems and procedures, SFD
is able to withstand external pressure and its unpoliticized fund allocation as an
organization has been central to its ability to operate in nearly all communities.

While recent price increases have affected project costs, water harvesting schemes remain
relatively cost-effective. With an average expenditure range of between US$60 and
US$70 per capita, water harvesting schemes tend to be more sustainable and appropriate
for low-income rural communities than most alternative technologies.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory
This rating is based on the consideration that through SFD3’s interventions: (i) the
majority of outcomes and outputs were achieved and in some cases, targets were
surpassed; (ii) access to and quality of basic services and economic opportunities were
increased in a cost-effective and participatory manner, with completed projects
benefitting more than half of the Yemeni population; (iii) SFD3 delivered a robust
capacity building program to a wide range of stakeholders, maximizing benefits from
investments and scaling up interventions effectively; (iv) SFD effectively contributed to
the development of policies and sector strategies, while also supporting reforms (e.g.,
decentralization); and (v) maintained a satisfactory technical and fiduciary performance
throughout its execution.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development. SFD supported the
poor and marginalized, promoted equity in basic services delivery, and helped build the
capacity of stakeholders for participatory development. SFD contributed to: (i) improving
poor households’ access to basic public services, especially those in rural/remote areas
where access has been limited; (ii) strengthening institutional capacities of stakeholders
nationwide, including mainstream and sub-national institutions and local communities for
public services delivery; (iii) increasing people’s voice in decision-making; (iv)
increasing girls’ enrollment in basic education by supporting integrated and gender-
sensitive interventions; (v) affording individuals with special needs equal access to the
stream of benefits from development efforts and facilitating their integration in
mainstream society; (vi) improving the quality of health care services for women; (vii)
providing poor women with access to credit and savings services; and (vii) creation of
employment opportunities for poor and affected households to help bridge their
consumption gaps.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening. Capacity building and institutional
development are two essential elements that underpinned SFD’s interventions. SFD


                                             21
supported a robust capacity building program to help strengthen human, social, technical,
organizational and institutional capacities among a wide range of stakeholders within and
outside government.

At the local level, local authorities are progressively becoming better prepared to fulfill
their roles in the areas of local development, bottom-up planning, finance, management,
and communication with communities. Use of participatory methodologies is
empowering communities to become active partners alongside districts and governorates.
Similarly, use of community development approaches is helping to facilitate
collaboration with local communities which can in turn serve to reinforce the effective
implementation of line ministries’ policies, especially in rural and remote areas. These
interventions have generated a high level of awareness among different levels of
decision-making (governorate, district, community) on their roles and responsibilities,
leading to improvements in local planning with defined responsibilities and increased
accountability.

SFD ensured the effective transfer and dissemination of its knowledge and proven
systems at all levels. It brought together national institutions, local authorities, civil
society organizations, and the private sector which often had divergent orientations and
helped forge a positive dialogue among them on participatory methodologies, local
development planning, management, and implementation, while also providing technical
assistance to develop skills in specialized fields. As an autonomous institution, SFD was
flexible in adapting its organizational structure and operational procedures as necessary
to further strengthen the effectiveness of its development interventions.

SFD capacity building activities have contributed to positive impacts on mainstream
institutions. In education, SFD supported MoE in the decentralized delivery of
educational services, contributing significantly to improvements in access and quality of
education, while helping to reduce the gender gap. In health, support to higher health
management institutes facilitated the training and process for qualifying female health
workers in the delivery of primary health care and maternal and child care – investments
that have contributed to an increase in female health workers operating in rural/remote
areas and greater utilization of health services. In social protection, SFD was instrumental
in supporting the development of several sector strategies and related operational
mechanisms which help further the cause of SNGs (see Section 3.2). In Cultural Heritage,
SFD’s collaboration with several line ministries have led to positive developments that
provide greater attention to and strategic support for the preservation of Yemen’s cultural
heritage assets. In Water/Environment Sectors, SFD championed the use of rainwater
harvesting schemes which has now been recognized by MoWE/GARWSS as a viable
alternative water supply technology. In Micro Finance, SFD supported institutional
development of MF programs and facilitated the consolidation and gradual
transformation of promising MF programs into viable MF institutions. It played a critical
role in facilitating the passage of Law No. 15, the development of the Small and Micro
Enterprise National Strategy, and the establishment of the Small and Micro-Enterprise
Promotion Agency.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
Water and Environment Sectors. SFD open water cisterns may allow snails infected
with schistosomiasis to proliferate. Infection rates are already high among Yemeni
children, with a recent WHO survey finding that only three Governorates are disease free.
Since identifying this risk, SFD has introduced measures to improve the design of water
storage cisterns; incorporated information on how to limit disease transmission into its
hygiene awareness campaigns; and coordinated with the National Schistosomiasis
Program to eradicate snails and provide treatment to the affected population.

The introduction of Community-Led Total Sanitation (CLTS) has expanded the
environmental and hygiene awareness campaigns from promotional activities aimed at
improving awareness to targeted behavior change interventions that aim to achieve Open
Defecation Free communities. As a result, the SFD was able to confirm that while
sanitation is a serious problem in most rural communities in Yemen, it is possible to
galvanize rural households into building improved sanitation facilities and improving
environmental health using low-cost CLTS interventions.

Building Governance Structures. While not fully recognized, SFD is making important
contributions to nurturing governance structures at the decentralized and community level
for planning and implementing development initiatives. SFD’s well-developed and
proven systems have contributed to strengthening relationships between community and
decentralized levels, with increased respect, trust and accountability (IE 2006). SFD’s
demand led approach, pro-poor allocation of resources on a nation-wide basis,
participatory processes, and transparency at all levels help promote solid systems of
governance that underscore State building.

School Maintenance. The maintenance of SFD-supported schools is a problem that is
linked to the challenges of decentralization. According to the decentralization law, local
councils are responsible for schools and should receive all school fees. However, MoE
recently decreed that no fees will be charged for grades 1-6. This waiver of school fees
has made it extremely challenging for local councils to finance school fees.

Scaling up of Pilot Interventions. Pilot programs implemented under SFD3 are being
scaled up under SFD IV to expand outreach and scale up results. These include, inter
alia: (i) Empowerment for Local Development Program; (ii) Labor-Intensive Works
Program; (iii) Pilot on Rural Girls’ Education; (v) Integrated Interventions Program; and
(v) CLTS Program.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
Not applicable.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate
Several elements are embedded in SFD’s operations which serve to mitigate potential
risks to development outcomes. These include: (i) effective, efficient and transparent
mechanisms for implementation; (ii) participatory methodologies that are allowing

                                           23
communities to take an active role in their own development; (iii) alignment of SFD
investments with community priorities and with national/sector policies and plans; (iv)
incorporation of lessons and experiences from previous phases of SFD, ensuring that
technical, social, fiduciary, and institutional elements of SFD projects are sound; and (v)
delivery of a robust capacity building program that empowers stakeholders to actively
participate in their development process, thereby promoting greater ownership and
sustainability of investments. Achievements of the three phases of SFD operations
increasingly illustrate how these factors help to mitigate risks to development outcomes
and how they are gradually contributing to good governance.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
IDA’s team worked closely with the Borrower during the preparation phase, jointly
identifying sector issues and strategies to address them. Lessons from previous SFD
operations were incorporated in the project design. The team benefitted from a multi-
disciplinary group of professionals and the continuity of core members of previous SFD
operations. The IDA Team collaborated closely with GoY and SFD counterparts to
ensure alignment of project design with national and sector priorities. Consultations were
carried out with development partners during project preparation.

There were three and inter-related shortcomings: (i) the Team did not provide the
necessary oversight to ensure consistency of the PDO in the PAD and in the DCA; (ii)
outcome/intermediate indicators were not sufficiently defined upfront to measure
progress towards the institutional development and empowerment dimensions of SFD3; a
few performance indicators were not well-defined and were difficult to measure; and (iii)
although SFD3 was the third phase of the SFD program, there was no Quality
Enhancement Review which could have, among others, have provided guidance in
identifying suitable outcome and intermediate indicators to measure program
effectiveness, while also reflecting the evolution of SFD’s program portfolio.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory
Joint supervision missions were regularly carried out by a multi-disciplinary IDA Team,
including consultants in specialized fields and representatives from development partners.
The IDA Team was effective in providing implementation support and flexibility, as
needed, to effectively respond to the demands of SFD3. During implementation, team
leaders changed. The transition in task team leaders was generally smooth and did not
cause delays in project implementation. During supervision missions, the IDA team
provided technical assistance to help address implementation bottleneck and carried out
fiduciary reviews regularly. The IDA Team ensured good donor coordination. Aide
memoires provided for comprehensive reporting on the overall progress with
implementation, albeit with limited discussions on the effectiveness of the program in

                                            24
meeting its development objectives. During implementation, the team helped mobilize
additional resources to reduce the shortfall in program financing as well as to help
address the negative effects of the global food price increase in 2008. The IDA team
participated in the preparation of the follow-up operation, ensuring the integration of
lessons from previous SFD operations.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
Overall, the Bank team provided appropriate technical inputs, full implementation
support, and proactively helped to leverage funding to reduce the shortfall in financing
for the third phase of the SFD Program and to help address the negative impact of the
global food price increase. The Bank ensured staff continuity in supporting SFD
throughout the project cycle. The Bank Team included staff with the appropriate skills
mix both from Headquarters and in the Country Office and consultant technical experts in
specialized fields, many of whom also collaborated in the previous phases of SFD. The
skills-mix of the extended Bank Team (staff and technical experts) included, inter alia:
social protection, economist, expertise in all sectors covered by SFD and in cross-cutting
areas such as procurement, financial management, monitoring and evaluation. The ICR
rates overall Bank performance to be Satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
The Borrower’s performance during preparation and implementation is rated Satisfactory.
GoY showed commitment to the Project’s development objectives and planned
interventions. It almost doubled its planned contribution and maintained SFD’s autonomy.
GoY considered SFD as an important partner in supporting pro-poor interventions to help
alleviate poverty, achieve MDG goals, and promote national development. There was
strong support for SFD operations and the collaboration with several line ministries has
improved over the previous phases..

(b) Implementing Agency Performance
Rating: Highly Satisfactory
The Project was implemented by SFD, an autonomous and experienced agency, with a
proven track record of effectively supporting broad based and participatory development
interventions nation-wide, with focus on rural and remote areas. SFD demonstrated by
example that implementation does matter. The use of effective institutional mechanisms,
participatory methodologies, transparent administrative and fiduciary methods, cost-
effective approaches, the establishment of decentralized branch offices, piloting
innovations to refine strategies for scaling up impact of interventions, robust and
integrated M&E mechanisms, and the systematic incorporation of lessons learned in its
operations, are all in line with best practices for achieving participatory and sustainable
development. Of significant importance are SFD’s contributions to building institutional
capacity of stakeholders throughout the country. SFD’s capacity building interventions
are contributing to the empowerment of communities to take the lead in their own


                                            25
development process; strengthening relationships at decentralized levels; building
capacity for accountable and transparent project implementation; improving
organizational, planning, and implementation capacity in key sectors; nurturing
governance structures at decentralized levels, and supporting development of policies,
strategies and reforms that promote Yemen’s development process.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Highly Satisfactory
SFD has consistently demonstrated satisfactory technical, institutional, implementation,
and fiduciary performance ratings throughout implementation. The SFD enjoyed strong
GoY support, and its activities have been aligned with the priority needs of communities,
and national and sector strategies, including those of donor agencies. The SFD continued
to operate as an autonomous entity under the Prime Minister’s Office and its Board of
Directors played a critical role in providing strategic directions, reviewing policy issues,
and approving important decisions such as annual plans and budgets and amendments to
the Operational Manual. The Executive Body is chaired by a Managing Director (who
has been with SFD since the first phase) who has full authority in managing SFD
operations, including all personnel and operational matters. In addition to the Sana’a
office, SFD established nine regional branch offices country-wide which are now making
a large number of operational decisions.

SFD has a dynamic group of about 200 competent, professional and committed staff in
Sana’a as well as in the regional offices with expertise ranging from engineering, to cross
cutting areas such as financial management, procurement, monitoring, gender,
community development, social protection, to sector-specific technical expertise in core
sectors supported by SFD. Many of the core staff have been with SFD since the first
phase. SFD strategically engages technical experts in specialized field to help fill the gaps
in skills that are not available in the organization.

SFD has established a well functioning Procedural Policy Committee and Projects
Approval Committee for strengthening coordination amongst the different department
and units within the SFD. SFD’s organizational structure includes 7 technical units
Education, Water & Environment, Health and Social protection, Training and
Organizational Support, Small & Micro Enterprise Development, Agriculture and Rural
Development, and Cultural Heritage) and 7 support units (Programming, Monitoring and
Evaluation, Finance and Administration, Procurement, Information Technology, Internal
Audit Research and Development, and Human Resources).

Finally, SFD has developed its organizational structure and subproject cycle very
professionally during the first three phases. It has a state-of-the art MIS system that was
designed in-house and that captures all aspects of the subprojects. SFD systematically
invests in capacity building and continuous learning for its staff.

These aspects have enabled SFD to effectively scale up its multi-sectoral activities that
directly benefit more than half of Yemen’s population.

6. Lessons Learned

Commitment by Local Authorities to Civic Engagement. Building working
relationships based on trust and confidence of local authorities at governorate and district
levels is essential to the decentralization process and to SFD’s efforts to promote
effective civic participation in local development. Clear communication of the distinct
roles and functions of local government and civil society and the way in which they are
brought together in a participatory process is essential to bring about recognition and
legitimacy of the bottom-up approach of development process.

Community contributions are important to ensuring ownership. Contributions,
however, should not impose a heavy burden on communities, especially low-income
households. During the last year of implementation of the third phase, SDF adopted a
unified approach which limits community contribution to 5 percent and exempts poor
people who are not able to pay. This new approach is expected to be fully implemented
during the fourth phase.

Building governance structures. Building the capacity of government apparatus and of
communities to play a responsible role and demand accountability from government are
key elements to building governance structures at decentralized and community levels.
SFD’s capacity building interventions and proven instruments that provide for a demand-
driven approach, pro-poor allocation of resources, use of verified data for decision-
making, participatory approaches, and transparency at all levels, help promote solid
systems of governance that underscore State Building.

Implementation of innovative pilots can help refine methodologies, provide incentives
for stakeholders to become active partners in the pilot, and provide lessons for scaling up
activities. SFD pilots to promote rural girls’ education, inclusive education for groups
with special needs, and integrated intervention programs all contribute to broader
education sector goals and priorities for improving equitable access to education.
Similarly, SFD’s pilot of the public workfare program has helped to provide a safety net
to mitigate the effects of food price increases on poor households, while at the same time
enabling the creation of physical infrastructure investments that become community
assets.

Consolidating and Prioritizing SFD interventions. SFD expanded outreach in several
sectors, and piloted innovations with a view to scaling up impact. While all of SFD’s
interventions are making important contributions to Yemen’s development agenda, there
is a need to prioritize and consolidate key areas of SFD interventions where it clearly has
the comparative advantage to achieve wider impact, facilitating the adoption of its proven
systems in mainstream institutions while also ensuring the long-term sustainability of its
operations. The design of SFD4 addresses these issues.

Integration of behavioral-change interventions can add significant value to water
infrastructure projects. Behavior change-oriented sanitation and hygiene interventions
can add significant value to water projects, through focusing attention on faecal-oral

                                            27
contamination routes and encouraging rural communities and households to reduce major
contamination risks through improved sanitation, water storage and domestic hygiene.

Social Funds can be effective mechanisms for delivering social risk management
functions. As an autonomous and flexible institution, SFD was uniquely positioned to
deliver a range of social risk management functions for the poor and vulnerable within a
changing country context and evolving needs of government. SFD contributed to
strengthening local institutions (risk mitigation); increasing access to basic services (risk
reduction), and assisting groups affected by external shocks through a public works
program (risk coping).

The design of impact evaluations should reflect the evolution of social fund program
portfolio. The evolution of SFD's project portfolio and approaches should logically result
in an evolving impact evaluation design, with the addition of new survey components to
evaluate new or revised interventions as appropriate. For example sanitation and
environment projects and related behavior change campaigns are missing from the
evaluation. The impact evaluation should respond to the SFD results framework (and the
results framework should evolve to match the project portfolio).

The articulation of clear and measurable performance indicators and robust
monitoring and evaluation mechanisms are necessary for monitoring (and further
strengthening) program effectiveness in achieving development objectives.
Performance indicators that are sufficiently defined at the outset help to focus on the
“development effectiveness? of project interventions. Robust monitoring and evaluation
systems help to monitor and scale up program effectiveness, inform policy decisions that
may be required to ensure satisfactory achievement of development objectives.

Measurement and methodologies must be appropriately defined to assess targeting
performance of demand-driven community development programs. Use of different
measurements and methodologies during different phases of a program such as the SFD
lead to distorted results. For example, use of proxy for household consumption (IE, 2010)
and observed household income (IE 2006) weakens the direct comparability between
household income and proxy means result. Proxy focuses on household consumption and
does not predict household. In the case of Yemen, income and consumption are not
highly correlated.

Note:

   GoY/SFD's projected total resource requirement for SFD3 (2004-2010) was estimated at US$ 963M. Commitments totaled US$ 909.5 million:
 US$814 million from development partners; US$75.5 million from GoY; and US$ 20 million from community contributions. Of the total
  commitment of US$909.5 milion, US$ 693.5 million has been secured at the time of the ICR mission, with approximately US$216 million
 yet to be released/made available to SFD. Based on these calculations,there is a financing gap of US$ 53.5 million to complete activities
 under both SFD3 (2004-2010) and programs and special programs implemente by SFD.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component:
The Project achieved the following outputs under its components:

Component 1: Community Development (US$497 million; 137 percent of original
estimate). This component implemented projects for small-scale, demand-driven delivery
of social and economic services and infrastructure in the education, water and
environment, health, social protection, cultural heritage and road sectors. SFD3
operations were implemented following a bottom-up approach involving communities at
all stages of the project cycle, while also ensuring proper coordination with relevant line
ministries and other donor-financed projects operating in the same sectors. To ensure that
the poor and vulnerable benefit from investments, a three-pronged targeting policy,
together with a comprehensive Geographical Information System (GIS), was used to
prioritize the allocation of resources to poor communities and remote areas. Pilot
activities linked to the sector strategies and plans were undertaken, contributing to the
national debate in a number of sub-sectors (i.e. standard design for school construction,
support for children and women in difficult circumstances, rural water supply) and in
some cases, guiding the directions for policy reform. Outcomes of this Component are
considered to be “Satisfactory?.

Education Sector: SFD’s vision for its education sector was to help the MoE implement
its national basic and secondary education development strategies and the goals
represented by the Education for All by 2015 and the Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs). SFD3 interventions were designed to increase access to and improve the quality
of basic education, while also contributing to closing the gender gap and enhancing the
decentralization of education services. The education sector continued to benefit from the
largest share of SFD resource allocation. More than US$360 million or 55 percent, of
SFD resources was allocated to this sector to implement four key areas of interventions,
the outcomes of which are described below. Of the 2,258 projects in the pipeline, 1,557
have been completed with direct benefits to almost 1,350,000 individuals, of which 45
percent were female. The remaining 701 projects that are under implementation are
expected to benefit an additional 300,000 individuals.


                                                                               33
Expand infrastructure and enhance the quality of school buildings. This sub-component
financed the construction, rehabilitation, and equipping of grade 1-9 schools,
rehabilitation of educational institutions, and construction of new classrooms and other
facilities for existing buildings. For school construction, priority was given to rural areas
to promote enrollment of girls in these areas. Schools were constructed following
standardized designs, enabling a better harmonization of the cost of school construction
by different organizations. Based on SFD MIS data, the average unit cost of completed
education projects was US$131,300. Communities contributed US$10 million, or 3
percent of the total cost.

As part of the school mapping exercise, all governorates now have a data-base on
inventories of schools which facilitate more effective planning for school construction,
teacher deployment, and related resource allocations. Support was provided to establish
and equip MoE’s Measurement and Evaluation Center, along with technical assistance to
support different aspects of the education process related to curriculum development and
teachers capacity to develop a “bank? of exam questions. These interventions have served
to enhance the sector’s capacity to absorb school-age children, and help promote an
enabling environment for learning. By the mid-term of the project, responsibility for
school construction was transferred to governorates, with local councils assuming the
responsibility for school maintenance in collaboration with community maintenance
committees. Linked to the challenges of decentralization, there are problems with
maintenance of SFD-supported schools, however. Although the decentralization law
provides local councils with the responsibility for schools and for local councils to
receive all school fees, MoE’s policy to waive school fees for grades 1-6 may have
undermined the capacity of local councils to finance school maintenance.

Piloting of innovations in the education sector has been an important part of SFD
interventions. Within the framework of the Education Quality Program, quality
enhancing approaches were piloted in 18 schools in 9 governorates. Under the
supervision of MoE, SFD delivered various capacity building activities with the overall
objective of strengthening teacher qualifications and effectiveness in the classroom to
enhance student learning outcomes. Lessons learned from these pilots have been
documented by SFD and widely disseminated. Discussions with MoE are underway to
identify options for mainstreaming and scaling up.

Piloted in 5 governorates where gender enrollment gap between students exceeded 90
percent in basic education, the Rural Girls’ Education Program promoted a
comprehensive approach to increase enrollment of girls and to enhance community
participation in supporting and advocating for girls’ rights to education. This pilot
financed: (a) classroom construction and equipment; (b) water harvesting to free girls
from the burden of traveling long distances to fetch water; (c) the establishment and
training of parents’ councils and student groups to support and advocate for girls’
education; (d) teacher training; (e) awareness raising campaigns; and (f) women’s literacy
programs and skills development classes for rural girls aged 10-14 years. An assessment
of lessons learned has been completed and recommendations for scaling up are currently
under discussion with MoE and donors.

Supporting Pre-school Education. Targeted to governorates without pre-school education
facilities and within the (fragmented) framework of MoE’s early child development
strategy, SFD piloted the construction and rehabilitation of kindergartens and training of
preschool teachers on the new curriculum. Of the 38 planned kindergarten projects, 28
have been completed and are attended by close to 25,000 students of which 56 percent
are girls. Due to lack of MoE capacity to assure the functionality of all planned
kindergartens, SFD reduced the number of kindergartens it supported, including the
number of teachers trained. As a result, SFD in collaboration with UNICEF supported the
establishment of a department for early childhood development in the Faculty of
Education of Sana’a University in order to support MoE’s strategy in this sector by
providing graduates who are specialized in this field. SFD’s engagement in the pre-
school education has inspired a renewal of efforts to address the fragmentation of and
work towards better coordination of pre-school education programs. This has resulted in
the establishment of a committee comprising government representatives from MoE,
MoSA and Higher Council of Mother and Child to review issues/weaknesses in the
planning and delivery of early childhood development programs, and division of
responsibilities.

Enhance the formation and functioning of parents’ committees and support the Ministry
of Education (MoE) in developing guidelines for these committees. SFD supported the
establishment and capacity building of parents committees to enhance their involvement
in school maintenance and overall education process. It also collaborated with MoE in
developing the guidelines for these committees which are now in use.

Health Sector. The main focus of SFD3 in the health sector was to support the Ministry
MoPHP’s efforts to improve coverage of basic health services and enhance health system
performance and human resource management to help achieve the MDG goals. To
achieve this, activities were implemented in the following areas; (i) training of service
providers; (ii) improving coverage and capacity of Health Management Institutes (HMIs);
(iii) strengthening community and local authority partnerships to improve health services;


                                                 35
and (iv) addressing reproductive health and neonatal care. Of the planned 428 projects,
295 have been completed and 133 are under implementation.

For the third phase, stronger focus was given to enhancing the quality of health services.
Given the experience in previous operations, SFD continued to refrain from building
health care facilities unless upfront assurances from the MoH were secured to provide
health staff and operational budgets to enable these facilities to function effectively. It is
within this understanding that SFD supported infrastructure improvements of 295
functional health facilities in remote and under-served areas.

To strengthen delivery of Maternal and Child Health (MCH) services, reproductive health
and neonatal care centers were constructed and/or renovated and equipped. Pre-service
training was provided to almost 2700 health care workers, the majority of whom were
women. Female health workers, including community midwives, were trained to raise
their competency in delivering reproductive health and primary health care services and
their availability to women in remote and rural areas. To improve educational
qualification processes, the curriculum for five training courses (midwifery and nursing),
the capacity of the teaching cadre, laboratories, and libraries of health institutions have
been upgraded. In-service training has been provided to staff of psychiatric hospitals and
care centers and the capacity of local councils in three districts to apply district health
system was strengthened.

Social Protection Sector. This Sub-component targeted “Special Needs Groups? (SNGs)
which included: the disabled; children-at-risk; women-at-risk; and the socially
marginalized. Interventions were to focus on: (i) integrating disadvantaged children into
mainstream education; (ii) training specialized educators for Special Education; (iii)
piloting the private sector-NGO partnership in managing and operating Government
welfare and rehabilitation centers for children; (iv) exploring possibilities for SFD
intervention in the area of mental disability; and (v) supporting the improvement of the
National Sign Language Dictionary, projects for Early Detection of Disability and Early
Intervention, and supporting the development of national strategies (i.e. for mother and
child, disability). Of the 318 SNG projects approved, 201 have been completed
benefitting close to 72,000 individuals; 117 projects under implementation are expected
to benefit an additional 61,000 individuals.

SFD had a strong focus on inclusive education for disabled children, promoting
participatory approaches in project design and implementation, engaging families as
advocates for the rights and services of their disabled children, and improving the
sustainability of facilities and programs. Professional staff from MoPHP, universities,
and public schools were trained in various areas (i.e., speech remedy and correction,
physiotherapy, early detection) to qualify them in providing inclusive education. NGOs
were trained to help supervise services provided to disabled individuals. To create an
enabling environment, social care and educational facilities were built and equipped,
community-based rehabilitation centers were established, and teachers and physicians
serving these centers trained. Together, these SFD-supported interventions benefitted
19,324 disabled students (of whom 20 percent were working children) who have been
integrated in 244 public schools.




                                           37
To support policies and strategies for persons with special needs, SFD supported: (i) a
national workshop on the Middle East Disability Surveillance Initiative to help build
advocacy for gathering disability-related information and publishing them for the
community at large; (ii) the establishment of a resource center at a national university for
early childhood development; (iii) the development of a National Strategy for Children
and Youth, and a National Strategy for the Disabled; (iv) the implementation of the 2004
Census by providing questions related to disability and orphans; (v) improvements in
services offered to women in prisons through rehabilitation works and provision of
furniture and equipment (i.e., construction and equipment); (vi) the First National
Conference for Autism to raise awareness in Yemen; (vii) the development of a vision
paper for caring and rehabilitation of the disabled through a self-evaluation process; (viii)
workshops with SFD partners to formulate ideas on the relations between the Disability
Fund and its partners, determining key areas of strengths and weaknesses and
opportunities for improvement; and (ix) the development of the Social Protection
Strategy which promotes improvements in targeting, coverage and development
outcomes for the poor through increased coordination and collaboration among Social
Protection service providers in Yemen and through improved social insurance program.

Feeder Roads: Given its primary focus on linking isolated areas to markets and services,
SFD assisted adjoining villages to explore and evaluate the cost of upgrade options,
design drainage, retaining walls and other components, and advised them on types of
labor and materials needed for works. Community members, community consultants,
engineers, technicians and accounts of SFD branch offices were trained on the use of
community contracting. In addition, training for and qualifications of project officers in
the branch offices were upgraded in order to improve monitoring and supervisory
performance of civil works. Finally, technical assistance was mobilized to support the
development of selection criteria to guide policies for higher level roads program, which
aims to link main roads networks (and markets) to current feeder roads.

At the time of the ICR, of the 294 feeder roads project approved, 196 were completed,
providing direct benefits to almost 1,367,000 individuals. In addition, 83 street pavement
projects in urban areas were completed and 55 are under implementation. Completed
projects included 2100 km of protected/improved roads and 2,017871 m2 of paved streets
in urban areas. Feeder roads projects were implemented using community contracting and
for some labor-intensive techniques were used, generating a total of 6,352,401 days of
temporary employment.

Cultural Heritage: Recognizing the importance of cultural heritage to national identity, its
potential significance as an economic resource, and the benefits that its restoration and
protection can generate for traditional workers and craftsmen who usually are poor, the
SFD continued to implement cultural heritage projects in the third phase. SFD’s pipeline
of 173 CH projects included restoration, conservation and documentation of Yemen’s
cultural heritage assets. At the time of the ICR, 105 projects were completed, benefitting
over 83,000 individuals. In addition to saving threatened sites and buildings, SFD helped
build the capacity of close to 1660 master builders and laborers, including 436 architects
in documenting and restoring cultural sites, while also promoting public awareness of



                                                     39
cultural assets. A database to help track inventory of cultural assets was established,
benefiting Yemeni museums.

SFD has made important contributions in strengthening collaboration with several line
ministries to promote the preservation of Yemen’s cultural heritage. These included, inter
alia: (i) endorsement of SFD’s vision and strategic interventions to preserve Yemen’s
cultural heritage by the Ministry of Culture; (ii) agreement of Ministry of Higher
Education to integrate elective and mandatory courses on preserving cultural sites in the
curriculum of national universities at undergraduate and post-graduate levels; and (iii)
establishment of a special department for Historic Mosques in the Ministry of
Endowments. Specialized courses, seminars and workshops for professional and decision
makers in key organizations (i.e., General Organization for Preserving Historic Cities,
General Authority for Lands, Survey, and Urban Planning, General Organization for
Antiquities and Museums, Ministry of Endowments) to increase their awareness and
knowledge on conservation of cultural sites were delivered.

During the third phase, concerted efforts were made to strengthen synergies between the
activities of the CH Unit and those of other SFD units. Collaboration between SFD’s CH
Unit, SMED/SMEPS Unit, and the Training and Organizational Support Unit, has
enabled the development of the “Development of Cultural Industries Project?, a pilot
which aims to improve livelihoods of the poor by providing economic opportunities to
showcase and market traditional handicrafts. Noteworthy of mention is the assistance
provided SFD to facilitate Yemen’s accession to the International Center for the Study of
the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property (ICCROM).

Water and Environment Sectors: Since its inception, SFD has carried out extensive
research and development of alternative water and sanitation technologies, including
rainwater harvesting, fog harvesting, community sand filters, and low-cost composting
latrines. Rainwater harvesting is now the mainstay of SFD’s water program. Water
harvesting schemes were implemented in areas highly dependent on rain water for
consumption, reducing the risk of water shortage while providing essential water for both
households and animal consumption. These schemes are based on renewable water
source and provide low-cost water and often included watering troughs for livestock,
sedimentation basins and pipelines to facilitate access by communities. The SFD has
invested considerable time and effort in ensuring that its water projects are demand-
responsive, well-designed, and sustainable, but the constraints of community contracting
and the temporary ban on non-mechanized supply have resulted in a relatively slow
implementation process.

                                             40
The original target for completing 750 water harvesting project was ambitious when
compared to the actual experience of completing only 58 water harvesting projects per
year for the period 2002-2006. During the Mid-Term Review (MTR), a joint decision
was taken to reduce the target to 60 projects per year. In contrast, the original target of
240,000 beneficiaries having access to water was revised upward, as the average project
size had been larger than expected. SFD3 financed: (i) open water harvesting schemes;
(ii) the construction of small dams to supply large quantities of water for irrigation,
household use, and animal watering; and (iii) improvements in water sources,
renovation/construction of water networks, distribution tanks and basins to collect water
from springs – investments that provide for reliable sources of water with modest
operation and maintenance costs that beneficiaries can afford. By August 31, 2010, of the
966 approved water projects, 465 have been completed, providing direct benefits to
almost 1,400,000 people of which 50 percent are women. Completed projects included:
431 water harvesting projects; 80 piped water supply projects; and 47 dam projects.
Significant capacity building 18 of SFD staff and consultants were implemented.

The third phase of SFD started before the approval of the National Water Sector Strategy
and Investment Program 2005-2009 (NWSSIP) which promoted the development of a
broad range of low-cost water supply technologies, with specific reference to the need for
sustainable alternatives to mechanized borehole systems. Given its key objective in the
sector of helping to reduce severe water shortages by financing water harvesting schemes
in areas dependent on rainwater, SFD3 included explicit guidelines for the water and
environment component 19.

The different basis and objectives of SFD and NWSSIP have led to conflicts, with key
sector stakeholders and some donors expressing concern that SFD was not progressing on
the commitments described in NWSSIP. In response, SFD flagged the sustainability
problems with mechanized borehole systems and the fact that SFD guidelines were
developed before the NWSSIP was published. Since the inception of SFD3, considerable
progress has been made on this matter. Both sides now appreciate the value of rainwater
harvesting schemes in some areas, e.g., where rainwater provides the only sustainable
water source or where there is a demand for low-cost solutions from rural communities,
and also that there is a need for alternative supply options, e.g., mechanized borehole
systems, in other areas. A national baseline survey for rural water supply and sanitation
facilities is under implementation to guide the development of appropriate, realistic and
coordinated plans for the achievement of sector (and program) goals.

Innovative pilot projects in water supply and sanitation were implemented to respond to
the quality problems associated with open surface water harvesting cisterns. These
included use of: (i) community slow sand filters; (ii) household water filters; (ii) covered

18
   These included, inter alia: exchange visits to water harvesting projects in Amran Governorate; pilot projects to
establish household rooftop rainwater harvesting systems; meeting to discuss establishment of network for participatory
management of irrigation projects; dissemination of booklet on “Awareness on Qat harms for school students?; and
evaluation of the environmental impact of SFD projects.
19
   These guidelines provided: (i) no drilling of boreholes; (ii) priority given to systems that operate by gravity; and (iii)
no mechanized systems accepted.

                                                            41
rainwater tanks; and (iv) private seqayat (household rooftop rainwater harvesting
cisterns). The latter approach leveraged large contributions from beneficiary households,
and provided significantly more appropriate and sustainable facilities than surface water
harvesting systems, but remains relatively expensive. The SFD continues to explore the
technologies, approaches and economics of household rainwater cisterns, and only
provided subsidies to households in target communities that were willing to invest and
construct private household cisterns, and also committed to support the poor families in
having their cisterns together with the better-off families.
For the third phase, SFD required that communities fund the provision of local materials
and unskilled labor, with estimated community contributions to capital costs averaging
about 30 percent. The requirement for higher community contribution has posed
difficulties for many poor households who found it difficult (or are unwilling) to
contribute at this level. In addition, the requirement has affected demand, with some
communities withdrawing applications after discovering their share of costs, and others
asking for smaller schemes in order to reduce their contributions. Responding to this
concern, community contribution has been reduced to 5 percent.

Several factors have contributed to initial delays in the implementation of water projects:
(i) introduction of the more time-consuming process of community contracting where the
community directly contracts local suppliers and transports materials, a novel experience
for communities but one that can lead to greater sustainability in the future; (ii) lower
demand for water harvesting subproject due to higher community contributions
associated with community contracting; (iii) backlog of uncompleted water projects from
previous phases; (iv) larger and more complex projects than anticipated during project
appraisal; and (v) overstretched staff.

Environment and Sanitation. Of the 93 approved projects, 61 have been completed which
included more than 35 large environmental sanitation projects (i.e., waste water
management, solid waste management and soil, and water conservation schemes).
Wastewater management projects included investments in treatment plants, renovating
sewer lines and building public toilets. Given the technical and institutional complexity
of wastewater projects, the SFD limited its investments to extension or rehabilitation of
urban schemes where there was community demand and where the service provider was
financially solvent. Solid waste management projects included building and equipping
slaughterhouses, introducing collection of solid waste, and management of hazardous
medical waste. Under SFD3, building the skills of staff (and consultants) in appraising
and supervising environmental projects and in some cases opening up trainings to
technicians from water and sanitation authorities (courses on low-cost wastewater
treatment method, O&M of wastewater treatment plants) were emphasized.

SFD introduced hygiene and environmental education (HEA) campaigns, alongside the
implementation of water harvesting projects to improve their cost-effectiveness, while
also increasing health benefits. HEA campaigns were suspended in 2005 due to high
initial costs, but were resumed in 2007 using a lower cost and more effective approach.
Over 60 environmental sanitation projects and 370 environmental and hygiene campaigns
have been completed, following an increased focus and accelerated implementation


                                            42
during the last two years of implementation. Public awareness activities also included an
event highlighting the negative environmental impacts of plastic bag disposal and a book
for students on the adverse effects of qat.

The Integrated Intervention Program (IIP). SFD implemented 83 integrated community
development projects and 71 capacity building interventions with the aim of maximizing
development impact in some of the poorest districts in the country. Overall these projects
contributed to improvements in access to basic education, adult literacy, water,
agriculture and health, benefitting 185,000 individuals.

Component 2: Microfinance Schemes (US$9.8 million equivalent of the final total
Project cost; 151percent of original estimate). By August 30, 2010, 10 Microfinance
Intermediaries (MFIs) supported by SFD served over 56,000 borrowers and over 51,700
savers of which 75 percent are women. Of the ten MFIs, eight are operationally
sustainable and one is financially sustainable. For the majority of MFIs, the average
portfolio at risk >30 days was under two percent. Although not financed by IDA, SFD
also supported the quasi-governmental small business lending agency – SEDF, with loan
funds and technical assistance benefitting 2,566 borrowers.

To provide MFIs a legally enabling environment in which to operate, SFD/SMED
supported the process of raising awareness and understanding of policy makers, including
related sector dialogue. SFD facilitated the development of Law #15 on Micro Finance
Banks by the Central Bank of Yemen (CBY), with technical assistance funded by KfW.
The Law has been enacted. The anticipation of this Law has facilitated the establishment
and prudent growth of Al Amal Bank, while Al Kuraimi Exchange Company (the largest
money transfer company in Yemen) was the first to receive a license under the Law # 15
for the establishment of Kuraimi Islamic Microfinance Bank.

With funding from GTZ, prudential regulations are being developed and CBY staff is
being trained in micro-bank licensing and supervision. In addition, two major initiatives
on enabling environment were successfully undertaken: (i) development and adoption by
the Cabinet of a National Micro Finance Strategy and Action Plan; and (ii) establishment
of the MF Network, a membership organization open to all players in the MF sector. The
latter is expected to operate as an information exchange and training and capacity
building facility for MFIs and banks. Among others, the network will develop regional or
international accredited training curriculum to be offered by local universities in
cooperation with international partners. To ensure adherence to best practices, SFD
became the caretaker of the GoY’s share (45 percent) in the newly established Al-Amal
Bank, initiated by the Saudi Agfund.

SFD/SMED built the capacity of its partners through a mix of national training
workshops, further development of MFI software Ma’een, and intensive hands-on
technical assistance for individual MFIs in areas such as internal audit, financial
management, accounting and governance. Ma’een, the in-house developed software
which is made available to all MFIs has been improved allowing for a savings component,
portfolio at risk and generation of CGAP and Small Education Enterprise Program
(SEEP) ratios such as OSS and FSS. Ma’een II was launched in 2009, which not only
includes an accounting module but also for analysis at the level of branches and a variety
of reporting formats. To support the operations of the SMED Unit, the MIS has been
developed for the Unit and the website (www.sfd-yemen.org/smed/english/index.php) is
 under continuous development.

SFD/SMED’s strategy of merger and consolidation of MFIs was overall successful. A
merger of the three programs in Aden into one MFI was a success and this MFI is now
merging with its ‘sister’ in Abyan, creating one strong sustainable MFI in the South. The
MF programs formerly known as the ‘ASA’ programs became the National Microfinance
Foundation (NMF), the largest MFI and a strong institution which is expected to
transform into a licensed micro-finance bank. The Hodeidah program took over good
clients of the two small programs in Beit Al Fakieh and Hais, which were closed-down as
they were too small to survive. Due to persistent and recurrent loan officer fraud, and
despite multiple SMED interventions, the Hodeidah program as a whole failed and
SMED stopped supporting this program, albeit after it had ensured that good clients
would remain served.

Component 4: Labor-Intensive Works Program (US$9.8 million equivalent of the
final total GFCRP Grant cost). SFD began to implement workfare programs in 2006 to
support national efforts to reduce unemployment. Building on its experience with public
workfare programs and social mobilization that support CDD modalities, in 2008, SFD
developed the Labor-Intensive Works (LIW) Program to help mitigate the effects of food
price increases on the poor through the implementation of labor-intensive cash-for-works
program that provided temporary job opportunities for severely affected and poor
households and individuals. Funded by the Bank’s Food Crisis Response Program Trust
Fund, 98 LIW projects were implemented in 8 governorates, providing temporary jobs to
36,000 individuals benefitting 16,800 households. A total of US$6.6 million in wages
was paid, corresponding to 899,361 days worked (6,200,000 hours). Labor-intensive
techniques were used to implement projects in the water/environment and roads sectors,
including support for Integrated Intervention Programs for which more than 50 percent of
funds were allocated.

Component 5: Capacity Building of the Social Welfare Fund (US$0.4 million
equivalent of the total GFCRP Grant). As part of the capacity building support for the
GoY’s Social Welfare Fund, this component financed (i) goods to support the national
survey, including IT support to various branches of the SWF; and (ii) consultancy
services to develop the monitoring and evaluation system and carry out the assessment of
the field work phase of the Social Field Survey, including related monitoring of the
processing and documentation of the 2008 survey data and results.

Annex 3A. Economic and Financial Analysis
The economic benefits of SFD can be represented by (i) improvements in household
wellbeing as a result of consumption smoothing, asset protection and the avoidance of
negative coping behaviors; (ii) enhanced livelihoods through asset accumulation and
increased productivity; and (iii) increased use of social services and better human
development outcomes as a result of the infrastructure created through the community
public works. Therefore, SFD provides both protective and productive benefits at the
household and the community levels.
This Annex draws upon results from a qualitative and quantitative impact evaluation of
SFD carried about by a consortium of Maxwell Stamp and COWI A/S. Impact Evaluation
(2010) used a ‘difference in difference’ approach to estimating impact comparing
communities aggregated into two groups: a treatment and a comparison group. The
treatment group comprises communities where SFD projects were completed prior to
November 30, 2009. Since a true control group based on random selection of SFD
communities was not possible, the comparison group was defined as communities where
SFD projects are under implementation and where only up to 30 percent of total funds
had been disbursed by November 30, 2009. The double difference approach represents a
significant methodological improvement over the 2006 impact evaluation, which only
compared the results in the SFD project communities before and after the situation.
In addition, the evaluation carried out in 2010 used a geographical stratification (urban
vs. rural areas) of sample projects and increased the number of projects and households
surveyed. The actual sample comprised 319 projects selected randomly but
systematically across Governorates ensuring an adequate proportion of projects in the
sample to the number of SFD projects within each governorate. From each project,
twenty households were randomly selected in the community to be interviewed, totaling
6,233 households.
Given that the community development program consists of multi-sectoral, demand-
driven interventions identified and prioritized by communities, SFD is prevented from
determining the portfolio of investments ex-ante. Therefore, an internal rate of return of
the proposed project cannot be calculated. However, other studies show that the rate of
return of projects typically financed through Social Funds can be high. International
experiences have shown that social fund programs can constitute a cost-effective
mechanism to channel public resources towards the provision of social services
(Rawlings and Van Domelen, 2001). Although an a priori cost-benefit analysis would
require knowing the exact composition of investments under the third, guidance from the
international experiences and from previous phases of SFD can help illustrate the costs
and benefits of SFD3.

This economic analysis assesses three issues: (i) the appropriateness of the current
portfolio of projects given beneficiaries demands; (ii) the economic viability and cost
effectiveness of the projects; and (iii) the effectiveness of targeting mechanisms and the



                                           51
projects’ incidence. The analysis is based on data from the previous phases on the Social
Fund 22.

Appropriateness of the Current Portfolio of Projects.
SFD investments reflect the needs of poor communities. The targeting system used by
SFD has a demand-driven approach, which is supported by a poverty index that allows it
to verify the poverty characteristics of potential communities of beneficiaries. To
complement the “demand driven? approach, the SFD seeks to identify specific service
coverage gaps based on a sophisticated Geographical Information System (GIS). The GIS
is used to identify particular needs that the SFD can address and also to ensure that the
SFD’s investments correspond to the local pattern of needs. Qualitative studies have been
used to review the extent and nature of community involvements and the perceptions of
those communities with regards to the works undertaken.

Awareness of SFD projects was very high. Of 6,233 households interviewed, 80 percent
were aware of an SFD project in their area, while 7 percent were not aware and 13
percent did not know. Seventy-nine percent of those who were aware of SFD projects
stated that the selection of the project was based on broad consensus, while only 10
percent responded that this was not the case. Ninety percent of the households agreed that
the selection of the project was a priority for the community and they would select the
same project again.

SFD has achieved a relatively high degree of direct involvement of beneficiaries: 75
percent of households reported that male members took part in meetings where the
projects were selected, and 34 percent of households reported female participation in
these meetings. After the projects had been selected, 64 percent of the households report
that there was some kind of community organization process linked to the project (19
percent did not know). 63 percent of households reported male participation in the
meetings of the beneficiary committees, and 26 percent of households reported female
participation in these meetings.

Adherence to transparency and accountability systems are central to SFD being able to
operate, even in difficult circumstances. Every district in Yemen receives an allocation
from SFD based on poverty indicators and population size. As a result, SFD has reach
into every district; it makes efforts to penetrate those districts that are remote and where
other government bodies cannot reach because of geographical remoteness or political or
tribal disputes. Moreover, SFD is seen to respond in times of crisis; for example it has
increased its investment in Hadramout following the floods and loss of life in 2008.
Similarly, it introduced a labor-intensive program to create employment as a response to
rising food prices. This system of resource allocation is deemed to help reduce conflict.

Education is the largest sector of the SFD portfolio. Table 1 shows the distribution of
completed projects through August 2010 and the average costs by sector in the third
phase of SFD. Education projects accounted for close to 63 percent of SFD’s investments

under the Community Development Component. Supporting the education sector has
been a major priority for SFD. From 1997 to 2009, it has funded over 3,900 education
projects valued at US$474 million. The SFD’s other major commitments were to water
projects, health projects, rural feeder roads projects, and cultural heritage preservation
projects. Due to data constraints, the cost analysis will be limited to the education
component of the SFD.

The SFD aligns its education investments with the Ministry of Education’s Basic
Education Development Strategy. The focus is on improving the quality of education
services and closing the gender gap in basic education enrolment and especially
promoting the education of girls in rural areas. The main target group under this
component are children between 6 and 14 years old. SFD’s activities in this sector seek to
contribute to improving the infrastructure of primary and secondary education through (a)
addition and/or expansion of classrooms and facilities for basic education to increase
access while also alleviating overcrowding, (b) restoration of some educational
establishments, and (c) furnishing and equipping of school buildings.
Ensuring community participation in all stages of the project cycle is central to SFD’s
operations. SFD is acknowledged by informants for the qualitative impact evaluation to
focus on the following: highly impoverished areas, education quality, and other niche
areas such as children with special needs, gifted and talented children, girls’ education,
school mapping, and pre-school education. Expansion of infrastructure for basic
education, which, as previously noted, is the largest form of SFD support to education, is
based on a demand-driven approach; the other activities are primarily implemented
through pilot programs in various locations throughout the country.

In the 2010 Impact Evaluation, 57 percent of all 6,233 households responded that they
contributed towards the implementation of the SFD project, 38 percent of households


                                              53
reported no contributions, and 5 percent were exempted from contributing. Those who
contributed did so primarily in the form of cash and in-kind contributions including labor.

Economic Viability and Cost-Effectiveness of Projects
Studies show that when conducted properly the benefits derived from community-based
contracting usually exceeded those under private contracting. Particularly, studies have
shown that in many countries, community managed resources have lower unit costs.
Lower costs per unit resulted from lower contractor profit margins, greater transparency
and accountability, better control of price increase and less expenditure on materials.

SFD’s average cost per project and per beneficiary varies greatly with subproject.
Based on the data provided by the SFD’s MIS for completed sub-projects, the average
cost per project has been calculated. Cultural heritage, education, roads, organizational
support and special need group projects are the most expensive. The results are presented
in Table 2.

The costs per beneficiary provide more useful information and are likely to have a
different pattern, as agriculture, environment, health, roads and water projects with larger
number of beneficiaries obviously tend to be less expensive on a per capita basis than the
other activities. Education projects usually have many more projects and fewer
beneficiaries than health project; only students currently enrolled in the schools that are
being constructed are considered, whereas in health projects the number of beneficiaries
is much higher and extends to the entire community. The costs per beneficiary have been
calculated using data from the SFD-MIS for completed sub-projects. As Table 2 shows,
the cost per beneficiary has increased in five sectors (cultural heritage, education,
integrated interventions, organizational support, and roads) in nominal terms since the
2006 Impact Evaluation. For some of these projects, this is a result of costs per project
increasing at a higher rate than the increase in beneficiaries. In the case of education,
increase in the project cost has also translated in an increase in the number of

                                                 54
beneficiaries from 550 in 2006 to 693. Taking into account inflation over the period (the
consumer price index rose 82.3 percent over 2003-2009), education, roads and water
have actually slightly reduced cost per beneficiary in real terms. In the case of health, the
average number of beneficiaries has risen significantly, while the cost per project has
fallen from almost US$13 to under US$4. A similar trend can be seen for environment
projects.

Crowding- in and Crowding-Out
The SFD projects have a substantial and increasing sector impact, particularly in
education and health. In 2001, the SFD’s share of the country’s total investment
expenditures in education was 19.5 percent and in health 8.4 percent. However, the risk
of crowding out private financing in the case of Yemen is very low. There is not enough
private infrastructure to reach communities being served by the SFD. Furthermore, the
SFD targets mostly activities which complement, instead of substitute government
activities.

As for crowding in, the SFD has been instrumental in attracting foreign funding for its
projects. The evolution of other donors’ support money has been very positive: it
increased from US$80 million for SFD1 to about US$420 million for SFD3, and it’s
expected to be higher in SFD IV.

Effectiveness of Poverty Targeting Mechanisms
The Community Development program is a demand driven program that uses a
systematic geographic targeting and allocations approach that: (i) identifies the poorest
and most deprived communities (using numerous poverty indicators); (ii) prioritizes the
needs of local communities; and (iii) ensures community participation in the
implementation.

The SFD targeting strategy can be summarized into three successive steps:
   • First, a geographic targeting identifies the poorest governorates and then districts
      to the areas with higher incidence of poverty 23.
   • Second, qualitative assessment tools identify the communities within the broad
      geographic allocation framework
   • Third, a programmatic targeting allocates additional resources to design and
      implement specific projects prioritizing the community needs and community
      participation.

As a consequence of the program’s targeting strategy, areas with higher poverty
incidence receive higher allocations although multi-sectoral activities of the program are
community demand-driven. Therefore, the program reaches areas with higher
concentrations of poverty but interventions are for both poor and non-poor inhabitants.


23
   For the community development program, geographic targeting uses poverty-related indicators from the
2004 Census of Population and Houses, the 2005/06 Household Survey and qualitative tools to further
refine broad geographic allocation of resources.


                                                  55
Of about 4,860 projects developed during 2004–2008, 2,389 projects totaling more than
US$300 million were geographic-targeting-based. These projects and investments were
distributed among four groups based on village poverty indices (Figure 1). 65 percent of
geographically targeted investments went to areas with a poverty index above 50 percent,
comprising a population of 9.2 million (73 percent of them poor). Only 35 percent
benefited better-off areas with a poverty index of 0–50 percent.

Qualitative targeting utilizes assessment tools and community participation approaches to
refine broad geographic and demographic indicators to ensure that the neediest areas
receive support. The SFD has been continuously improving its tools and deepening its
engagement with communities. This approach allows more strategic investments within
areas, as there are often diverse circumstances within districts as a result of social and
economic factors.

Programmatic targeting includes the Integrated Interventions Program (addressing needs
in the poorest areas), girls’ education program (allocating additional resources to areas
with low enrollments of girls), quality education program (aimed at developing models to
address low-quality education) and various training programs (targeting shortage of rural
health workers).

Figure 1. Distribution of SFD investments 2004-08, by poverty level of community




The 2010 Impact Evaluation’s (IE) assessment of targeting used a Proxy Means Test
(PMT) model that predicted consumption deciles to measure the targeting accuracy of the
program, because a national Household Budget Survey data was not available in
2009/2010. As it would be inaccurate to use these consumption based findings against
the stated income deciles based indicator, the 2010 IE recommended to conduct a study
that measures the actual performance of SFD targeting.



                                           56
Findings of a review undertaken by Leite (2010) on the IE 2010 Household Data base
shows that the aspects of great concern about the targeting findings presented in the 2010
IE report, which compares targeting of SFD Community Based Program interventions in
2009 and in 2006, are related to: (i) comparability concerns – the measurement of the
targeting indicators is affected by the different methodologies used in 2006 and in 2009;
and (ii) standardization concerns – the comparison of targeting indicators is affected by
SFD program design, missing observations in the 2006 data, and sample bias in the 2009
data. In addition, Leite (2010) argues that since the proxy of consumption was designed
with the purpose of classifying the households into poverty groups, all related proxy-
based studies should use the specific SWF poverty cut-off points. Based on this approach,
Leite (2010) shows that 30 percent of SFD resources go to the extreme poor, 54 percent
to both extreme and moderate poor and 79 percent to all poor households (see annex 3B).


Impact of education projects
The results show that SFD is a major national contributor to expanding access to school
and also school enrollment rates.

For education, the increase in enrolment rates from 2006 to 2010 was 14.4 percent in
average across boys and girls age 6 to 14 (IE, 2010). The SFD has had a significant
impact on increasing enrolment rates, and particular success was found when girls’
schools were built. Positive impacts of SFD interventions were also found for satisfaction
rates and returns on investments appear to go beyond just the building and maintenance
of the school building, as SFD schools had more books, better quality teaching, and
presence of toilets and water. When controlling for the changes in enrolment in the
communities where SFD had not yet implemented such projects (the comparison group),
it is possible to determine the impact (expressing the double difference) of the SFD
interventions. For girls in mixed schools the impact was 2.9 percent higher enrolment; in
girls' schools it was 6 percent higher. For boys in mixed schools the impact was 9.3
percent higher enrolment; when girls' schools are built the net impact on boys enrolment
is 8.4 percent higher (IE, 2010).

While increased student enrollment is clearly one of SFD’s development priorities (and
related directly to Yemen’s Millennium Development Goals), it has not been matched
with a commensurate increase in qualified teachers. Moreover, financial sustainability
continues to be a concern for school administrators who are responsible for covering
operation and maintenance costs of new/rehab classrooms but have quite limited
authority to raise revenue. Although not directly the responsibility of the SFD, these
wider education quality and financing policy issues are critical for SFD investments to
produce desired development impacts.

The most common reason for school dissatisfaction among respondents in the 2010
Impact Evaluation is a shortage of books and other educational materials. In this regard, a
drop in dissatisfaction rate is noticeable after SFD school projects are completed
compared to the pipeline (dissatisfaction rate dropping from 25 percent, where no
projects have been completed, to 19 percent after SFD has invested). The problem with
shortage of books resurges slightly to 21 percent among the older projects, indicating that

                                            57
the SFD projects have a degree of sustainable impact in terms of reducing this problem.
Inadequate toilet facilities and access to water is also a strong factor causing student
dissatisfaction with their schools: it is the second most commonly cited problem for girls
in pipeline communities. Poor teaching is the third most important problem where SFD
has not completed projects, the lack of female teachers is the second most important
reason for school dissatisfaction where SFD has recently completed projects (2006-
2010). This indicates that SFD projects have the effect of improving the standard of
teaching, but not in solving the problem of lack of female teachers.
The SFD has also addressed the low school attendance of girls by constructing new
schools and classrooms specifically for girls and therefore allowing for a higher female
enrollment rate in the beneficiary communities. Enrollment rates of girls, where the SFD
investments were made, have been improving. This is a very positive finding,
reconfirming that the SFD is making an important difference to one of the most critical
development indicators in Yemen.

Other impacts of SFD projects

Health - given previous negative experience with building health care units that were not
sufficiently staffed and maintained, in the third phase SFD focused on raising the
competency and availability of female health cadre to women in remote rural areas,
especially surrounding reproductive and primary health care services. The Impact
Evaluation found improvements in equipping, staffing, and availability of most services
in SFD facilities since 2003, but the delivery of daily integrated and preventive services
is far from being regular. The SFD is found to have positive results on children’s
vaccination and the beneficiary assessment suggests that SFD-supported program for
midwives is valued by men and women for making female health professionals available
in home for pregnancy and childbirth in remote villages.

The 2010 Impact Evaluation found that SFD has a strong positive impact on the
propensity of impoverished females to seek healthcare when ill and incapacitated. No
significant effect on male utilization rates was observed from the data set. The impact
evaluation did not find a significant overall impact of SFD interventions on pre-natal care
utilization. However, when focusing the analysis on the Health Centers and Mother and
Child Health (MCH) clinics positive results were found.

There remain areas where further progress can be made. Although SFD is having an
impact on the utilization of pre and post natal care by households the cost of care is still a
deterrent for 20 percent of households. Another outcome that has been analyzed is the
impact of community mid-wives on beneficiary health status, particularly ante- and post-
natal care. The statistical analysis showed that women in communities receiving SFD
support had a higher propensity to be assisted by community mid-wives during delivery.
Regarding vaccination rates, it appears that the SFD has a significant impact on mothers
in higher consumption deciles receiving vaccinations, but that the same is not true for
poorer mothers – for whom the impact is negligible.



                                             58
SFD has had a strong positive impact on access and utilization of health care, particularly
for poor females who are ill and incapacitated (IE 2010). The survey results show that 64
percent of respondents’ believe that access to health care has improved due to SFD
interventions. Seventy-six percent of beneficiaries had used health facilities in SFD areas
within the last month if they were ill. Eighty-four percent answered that they now always
or usually seek treatment when they are ill. Both these rates are improvements to
previous years and areas where no SFD support is available.

Water projects were found to improve the availability of water, and significantly reduce
the time households spent fetching water. However, the average time spent fetching water
in the dry season remains above 30 minutes in most SFD water project communities,
which has implications for reduced water consumption and use of lower quality water
sources. The 2010 Impact Evaluation findings also confirmed that recently implemented
rooftop rainwater harvesting projects have higher impacts and greater satisfaction ratings
than other water projects, thus support the current SFD policy to promote these schemes
where possible. No data were available on hygiene practices or health outcomes, thus the
impact of SFD sanitation and hygiene interventions could not be ascertained.

Rural roads projects were found to have direct impacts on access to education, health
and other services by decreasing travel times and increasing frequency of trips.
Decreased transportation expenses directly led to cheaper prices for tanker water, fuel
and other basic commodities. The SFD reduced a beneficiary’s travel time to market by
43 minutes per trip. The qualitative analysis clearly showed that people (75 percent)
perceived the SFD road interventions to have brought many economic benefits (i.e.
reduced time and cost of travel; better access to commodities, and savings on better
transport of commodities) but in terms of reducing the costs of commodities the statistical
analysis showed no impact.

Community empowerment – the surveys also indicate a high-level of ownership and
support for SFD-financed projects with the majority of interviewees indicating that they
would have chosen the same project as a priority for their community. Households
contribute money, working days and materials for infrastructure projects and elect their
neighbours to serve on procurement, project and maintenance committees. The majority
of projects have project maintenance committees. The direct involvement of women in
project selection and maintenance is low, though the beneficiary assessment found that
SFD processes encourage opportunities to discuss female participation.

Annex 3B. SFD Community Development Program -
          Effectiveness of Targeting Mechanisms

A key objective of SFD phase III is that at least 40% of its resources go to the lowest
three income deciles. However, a Proxy Means Test (PMT) model that predicted the
household consumption - and therefore predicted consumption deciles - was used to
measure the poverty targeting of the SFD programs. As it would be inaccurate to use
consumption based findings to assess SFD poverty targeting performance against the
stated income deciles based indicator in the results framework, the 2010 impact
evaluation (IE) recommended conducting a study that measures the actual performance of
SFD in reaching the poor.

In addition a recent study by Leite (2010) has shown that there are significant
measurement and methodological issues. Firstly, while SFD’s targeting process for
community development programs (70-75 percent of its budget) is based on geographical
targeting, the outcome indicator measures household-level targeting. Secondly, different
methodology and data sources were chosen to assess the targeting of the Community
Development Program. While the 2006 IE used observed household income as the basis
for analysis, in line with the SFD3 indicator of observed household income, the 2010 IE
used a proxy for household consumption developed by the Social Welfare Fund (SWF)
for its cash transfer program. Leite (2010) argues that there are key underlying
methodological differences which weaken the direct comparability between household
income and the proxy means result. If the proxy means results are to be used to measure
SFD's poverty targeting performance at the household level, that is, to identify whether a
household is extremely poor, moderately poor, or not poor, then it is more appropriate to
rely on the poverty cut-offs related specifically to the proxy means testing approach
rather than on simple decile cut-offs which are more prone to error when applied to the
proxy means methodology.

This Annex discusses in more detail the recent findings on the targeting outcomes of
SFD’s Community Development Program that provides both protective and productive
benefits at the household level in selected communities. It draws on the results of the two
qualitative and quantitative impact evaluations carried out in 2006 and 2010 and on
Leite’s recent study (2010). Findings of the 2010 IE though not yet conclusive suggest
that SFD Community Development Program interventions in sectors such as education,
health, water, roads and microfinance have generated satisfactory results, but the poverty
targeting performance did not meet expectations. Some factors that help to explain such
differences are discussed below.

SFD targeting approach
SFD’s Community Development Program is a demand-driven program that uses a
systematic geographic targeting and allocations approach to identify the poorest and most
deprived communities (using numerous poverty indicators), prioritize the needs of local
communities, and ensure community participation in the implementation of subprojects.
SFD utilizes three key targeting strategies:

                                            60
   1. Geographic targeting to identify the poorest governorates and districts with the
      highest incidence of poverty;
   2. Community targeting using qualitative assessment tools and participative
      approaches to identify the communities within the broad geographic allocation
      framework; and
   3. Programmatic targeting to allocate additional resources to design and implement
      programs and projects affecting specific communities and groups.

Under this strategy, areas with higher poverty incidence receive higher allocations,
although multi-sectoral activities of the program are community demand-driven.
Therefore, the program reaches areas with higher concentrations of poverty but
interventions are for both poor and non-poor inhabitants.

2006 and 2010 Targeting assessment
The impact evaluations carried out in 2006 and 2010 used different approaches to
measure performance in achieving the target indicator described in the Results
Framework: at least 40 percent of SFD resources go to the lowest three income deciles of
the country. Although the consultant firms recruited to carry out the 2006 and 2010
impact evaluations both collected a household survey of actual and potential beneficiary
households for a sample of subprojects randomly selected from SFD’s subproject
portfolio, it was only the consultant firm for the 2006 IE that collected all the information
needed to correctly estimate the targeting indicator.

To measure performance in achieving the target indicator, the consultant firm for the
2006 IE collected self-reported household income for each sampled household. This self-
reported household income was then directly compared to the income deciles estimated
from the 2005/06 national Household Budget Survey. In contrast, the consultant firm for
the 2010 IE collected a set of 22 variables to estimate a Proxy for household well-being.
This proxy provided the consultant firm with a good estimate of household consumption,
but not household income, for the evaluation.

As a result of this change in methodology, it is not appropriate to assess SFD poverty
targeting performance in 2010 without conducting a study that measures the actual
performance of SFD targeting based on the PMT methodology.


Concerns on SFD targeting performance in 2010
The change in the methodology of the 2010 IE did not provide an appropriate means
through which to assess the results framework targeting indicator directly as stated in
Leite (2010) and the IE report.

Leite (2010) has presented evidences that there are key underlying methodological
differences which weaken the direct comparability of a PMT approach and the required
targeting indicator. For example:



                                             61
   •   Any proxy developed for estimating the household wellbeing should not be used
       as actual wellbeing. A proxy has embedded errors, because it is derived from
       statistical models.

   •   The proxy does not predict household income, but household consumption.
          a. Mistakenly, researchers assume that income and consumption are highly
              correlated in Low Income Countries such as Yemen. This assumption does
              not hold true because a large share of the population relies on their own
              production and livestock to increase food consumption, or to trade goods.
              In addition, significant in-kind payments and in-kind assistance helps
              households to sustain their consumption levels. In the case of Yemen, the
              actual income-consumption correlation is significant, but relatively small,
              0.34. Leite (2010) shows that as a result of such low correlation a massive
              re-ranking of households across deciles is observed when comparing
              household income and household consumption levels in the country.
   •   In order to compare 2006 and 2010 IE targeting outcomes, additional data is
       required.
          a. Key variables comprising the proxy such as ownership of a television,
              telephone and washing machine were not collected in the 2006 IE.
              Moreover, 2010 household survey data collection was compromised in a
              few conflict areas likely to be poorer than other communities in the
              household sample.

Alternative method for measuring SFD poverty targeting
The proxy used for the 2010 IE was designed to identify poor households that would
participate in the Social Welfare Fund (SWF) cash transfer program. As a standard for
program participation, the SWF has generated consumption poverty related cut-off points
based on the regional poverty lines developed by the World Bank for its most recent
Poverty Assessment (World Bank Poverty Assessment, 2008). The cut-off points allow
the SWF to classify households in six poverty-related groups (A through F) for receiving
cash assistance programs (see Table 1). The A-F categories are defined as follows:

   •   A and B - Extreme Poor
   •   C - moderate poor
   •   D - poor
   •   E - vulnerable to poverty
   •   F - not poor.

Categories A-D represent populations living under the poverty line (34.8% according to
the 2007 Yemen Poverty Assessment).




                                           62
Table 1: Social Welfare Fund categories of poverty for its cash assistance program
Categories of poverty                              Main groups
A: Immediate assistance                            Extreme Poor
B: Assistance conditional on budget availability
                                                   Extreme Poor
- no surveillance
C: Assistance conditional on budget availability
                                                   Moderate Poor
- light surveillance
D: Assistance conditional on budget availability
                                                   Poor
- moderate surveillance
E: Assistance conditional on budget availability
                                                   Vulnerable to Poverty
- high surveillance
F: Not deserve                                     Not poor

Leite (2010) argues that since the proxy of consumption was designed with the purpose
of classifying the households into poverty groups, all related proxy-based studies should
use the specific SWF poverty cut-off points. Based on this approach, Leite (2010) shows
that 30 percent of SFD resources go to the extreme poor, 54 percent to both extreme and
moderate poor and 79 percent to all poor households.

What’s next for SFD targeting?
The evolution of SFD's project portfolio and approaches should logically result in an
evolving impact evaluation design, with the addition of new survey components to
evaluate new or revised interventions as appropriate (i.e., sanitation and environment
subprojects and related behavioral change campaigns are missing from the evaluation).

It is therefore critical that a more robust methodology for evaluating targeting
performance be developed for the fourth phase. It may be necessary to revisit the
targeting indicator in the Results Framework for the fourth phase to ensure that it
appropriately captures the evolution of SFD’s portfolio and approaches which, in turn,
should guide the design of future impact evaluations.

Implementation Completion Report - Social Fund for Development Phase III
(2004-August 2010)

1.       ABOUT SOCIAL FUND FOR DEVELOPMENT. The Social Fund for
Development (SFD) was established as an autonomous state organization under the
Council of Ministers in 1997 by Law 10 of that year. The Prime Minister is the Chairman
of its Board of Directors. SFD has since its establishment, with extensive and expanding
support from the Government t and the donor community, become a large and active
institution of State, with operations all over the country but with priority given to the
poorer communities and districts in each governorate, in several sectors including
education, health, water and environment, village access roads (rural feeder roads: RFR),
cultural heritage, small and micro enterprise (SME) development, social protection,
training, and capacity-building of partner-institutions.

The SFD’s main development goal is to improve access to basic social and economic
services among Yemen’s low-income population, while providing an example of an
effective, efficient, transparent institution by refining approaches to service delivery,
supporting local authorities and empowering communities.

The SFD achieves its goals through four main programs:
• Community development initiatives facilitate access to basic social and economic
   services—mainly in rural areas deprived of such services, as well as some urban
   areas.
• Capacity building of local partners, along with efforts to support capacities and
   organize communities and some government agencies and nongovernmental
   organizations (NGOs).
• Small and Microenterprise Development projects enhance small and microfinance
   services by supporting intermediaries such as NGOs and financing institutions, and
   develop business sector to provide nonfinancial services for small entrepreneurs.
• Labor-intensive works focus on creating job opportunities to temporarily absorb
   unskilled workers.

The SFD has completed the first phase of its operations (1997–2000), which involved
US$90 million in investments, and the second (2001–03), with US$198 million invested.
Both phases achieved significant outcomes. The third phase, originally planned to run
from 2004–08, was extended to 2010 to synchronize with the government’s third Five-
Year Plan for Economic and Social Development and Poverty Reduction (2006–10).

SFD funding has come from many internal and external sources. These include the
Yemeni government, World Bank, U.K. Department for International Development,
Saudi Fund for Development, Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development,
European Community, German Development Bank (KfW), International Fund for
Agricultural Development, Islamic Development Bank, Netherlands, OPEC Fund for

                                           67
International Development, United States, United Nations Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organization, Italy and Oman. In addition, communities that benefit from SFD
interventions contribute to project costs by providing labor, construction materials and/or
other in-kind contributions, and cash.

2.      ACHIEVEMENT OF PROJECT OBJECTIVE AND OUTPUTS. Initially, a
total amount of US$400 million was planned for the third phase (2004-2008). In order to
align its plan with the National Plans, SFD III extended two more years and mid-term
vision was prepared in 2006 for the period 2006-2010. The World Bank’s original
contribution to this phase was evaluated at US$60 million. An additional amount of
US$15 million was approved in 2008, and a US$10 million grant was approved at the end
of 2008 under the food crisis response program.

By August 31st, 2010, the SFD has approved 6,971 projects with a total cost of US$846
million. Number of completed projects is 4,461 of which 4,193 are completed projects
under the main three components of SFD original phase and 268 projects under the newly
added program including rural and urban versions of LIWP and Rain fed Agriculture
Development program. About 2,510 are still under implementation of which 2,203 are
from the main three components of SFD II and 307 from the newly added programs.
Most of under implementation projects are from SFD extended phase III that is still under
implementation. Furthermore most of SFD III (both original and extended phases) output
and outcome indicators were achieved by the end of 2009.

2.1    COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT: IMPROVING ACCESS TO BASIC
SOCIAL SERVICES. Initially, a total amount of US$364 million was planned for this
component for the entire third phase to benefit people with improved access to basic
services such as basic education, health, water supply and sanitation, improved road
access etc. For the entire third phase until August 31st, 2010, SFD reached an estimated
10.8 million people by implementing 4,630 projects at a total cost of US$659 million, of
which 2,930 completed projects with an overall cost of US$325.5 million and average
cost of US$111,111. The number of projects being implemented under this program is
1,700 projects with a total cost of US$333.8 million.

2.1.1 Education. The SFD’s vision for education during its third phase seeks to support
the National Basic Education Development Strategy and strengthen the overall education
system.

A.        Achievements:
- Providing Equal Access to Education: 10,051 new classrooms were built and 1,297
classrooms rehabilitated, which will together accommodate around 628,588 students (an
average of 50 students per classroom), of whom 265,336 are female. This exceeds the
initial target of 403,000 students.
- Narrowing the gap in education between males & females in rural areas: 1,451
infrastructure projects were completed; 145 workshops were implemented, in addition to
7 projects for awareness.



                                            68
- Contributing to improving the quality of education: The SFD has contributed to
refining the educational process by supporting three main programs: Education Quality
(51 projects), Pre-school Education (26 infrastructure projects) and Gifted and Talented
Program (17 projects).
- Supporting Non-Formal Education: During the third phase, the SFD gave more
attention to informal education programs and adult education through providing support
to several activities in the area of infrastructure to expand scope of inclusion, capacity
building, development and update training programs, curricula and manuals.
- Supporting education decentralization and Institutional organization of MoE:
Activities in the third phase included a project to develop an MIS for MoE's General
Department of School Mapping, and train staff in its operation (10 employees).
Additionally 58 projects were implemented to build and furnish education offices in
many governorates.

B. Lessons learned
-    Scaling up the quality of education and rural girls' education program. SFD needs to
coordinate with MoE and the local authority in terms of administration and management,
teacher knowledge and skills, student participation in the educational process results, and
in bridging the gap between education and the necessities of contemporary life skills
(Impact Evaluation Report 2009).
-    Planning for the fourth phase should be in both directions: bottom–up and top-
bottom.
-
2.1.2 Health. SFD has contributed to supporting the health sector and the efforts of the
Ministry of Public Health and Population (MoPHP) to achieve the national health goals.

A. Achievements. 428 projects were developed at an estimated cost of US$30 million,
with the number of direct beneficiaries estimated at three million persons, of which 1.9
million are females (62.8 percent).

- Institutional Building: In partnership with MoPHP, four projects have been developed
to strengthen the health systems.
- Improving access to health care facilities:
        • Increasing access to primary health care: 192 projects were implemented to
        increase coverage of PHC services.
        • Reducing maternal and neonatal mortality: 69 projects were implemented to
        expand and improve reproductive health services by building and equipping basic
        and comprehensive emergency obstetric (EmOC) departments, and maternal and
        child health centers.
        • Enhancing the skills of health care providers: 101 projects have been
        implemented to qualify and train about 2990 health staff.

- Improving the quality and capacity of Health Training Institutes: 36 projects were
implemented targeting all the public health institutes. SFD has evaluated its interventions
in the health institutes in order to identify strategic priorities for the support to be



                                            69
provided to these institutes in the fourth phase––in addition to defining the role of the
MoPHP and donors within the framework of this support.
-    Supporting psychiatric and mental health care: Ten projects were implemented.
SFD has supported developing the national mental health strategy and its operational plan
for the five coming years (2011–15). Moreover, the training provided in this regard
focused on health staff as an integral part of PHC services.

B.      Lessons learned:
- The implementation of any pilot projects or programs must be in the context of
strengthening the health system and the ownership of the MoPHP and its governorate
health offices (GHOs) –in addition to analyzing the health system capacity to ensure
sustainability of interventions.
- It is important to focus on "health determinants" as health improvement cannot be
achieved by improving the health services only or apart from the other services such as
water, environment, etc. Such an integrative concept will enhance the link between health
and development.

2.1.3 Water. The results of SFD's implemented sub-projects demonstrate that rainwater
harvesting is still dominating SFD's interventions in the water sector as it comprises 74
percent of all implemented sub-projects, while the other sub-sectors (for the piped water,
and small dams and irrigation) ranked 16 percent, and 10 percent respectively.

A.      Achievements:
-    Communal Rainwater Harvesting: SFD implemented 252 rainwater-harvesting sub-
projects, which include building new/rehabilitating existing cisterns benefiting 273,933
people. In total 587 cisterns and karifs were constructed/rehabilitated providing an
additional capacity of 797,090 m3.
-    Rooftop Rainwater Harvesting (RRH): SFD has approved a special program for
rooftop rainwater harvesting with a budget of US$20 million during 2009-2010. SFD
implemented 179 rooftop rainwater-harvesting sub-projects, including building
new/rehabilitating 15,330 cisterns, benefiting 216,765 people, and providing an
additional capacity of 765,913 m3.
-    Piped Water Systems: SFD has implemented 80 piped water sub-projects benefiting
257,143 people.
-    Small dams and Irrigation: SFD has implemented 47 dam and irrigation sub-projects
providing an additional capacity of 3,696,055 m3, benefiting 113,623 people.
-    Training and Hygiene Awareness: In total 42 training sub-projects have been
implemented benefiting 972 consultants and project officers.

B.      Lessons learned:
- As the level of the project goes down to the household level (RRH for example),
contributions and ownership go up, and consequently SFD’s investment per capita goes
down. Therefore, communities shall be given the choice of the level of project they prefer.
- The issue of water borne diseases has to be reflected in the development of sub-
projects.



                                            70
2.1.4 Environmental Protection. SFD works in four sub-sectors, namely wastewater
management, solid waste management, soil and water conservation, and training and
awareness. In total, SFD implemented 101 sub-projects. These sub-projects benefited
609,856 people. During this phase, SFD has adopted the approach of Community-Led
Total Sanitation (CLTS) to strengthen the impacts of hygiene awareness, and better
achieve behavior change.

A.      Achievements:
- Wastewater Management: SFD implemented 28 sub-projects benefiting 173,478
people.
- Solid Waste Management: 18 sub-projects were implemented serving 367,777 people.
- Soil and Water Conservation: 15 sub-projects were implemented serving 51,830
people.
- Training and Awareness: A manual for designing sanitation systems was developed.
In total 43 training sub-projects have been implemented benefiting 264 consultants and
POs.
- In June 2007, SFD introduced the " CLTS approach to the country. Seven branches
have already assigned a PO dedicated for the hygiene awareness and the others are on the
way. 350 Consultants (male and female) and all POs have been trained on the approach.
In total 370 campaigns have been conducted covering 118,486 people in 475 villages,
and 54 villages have achieved a 100 percent open defecation free state.

B. Lessons learned:
As a result of conducting CLTS in communities, the sanitation coverage rose from 25
percent to 75 percent according to the average results of the implemented campaigns.
This impact is encouraging and is calling for expansion in CLTS particularly when
comparing the impacts with the low cost per campaign which is US$650, and US$400 in
case of hiring consultants and NLs respectively.

2.1.5 Road Sector. SFD's intervention in the projects of paving streets aims to provide
temporary job opportunities for local communities, and improve the environment of the
targeted areas.

A. Achievements:
By the end of 2009, SFD completed 196 rural road sub-projects, costing US$30.7 million.
In addition, SFD approved 182 street paving projects, and conducted 49 projects for
training and building capacity (including those supporting community contracting).

B.    Lessons learned:
- Reducing the work of machineries, and focusing more on work done by laborers as
much as possible. Extra widening should be provided only on very critical portions of the
road.
- Maintenance committee should be selected and organized as early as possible.

2.1.6 Social Protection. The vision of the SFD concerning the third phase in the Special
Needs Group has focused on the contribution to improve the life of the children living in


                                           71
difficult conditions through the provision and improvement of the health, educational and
social services provided to them; supporting the efforts of the government and NGOs to
provide such services.

A. Achievements:
By the end of August 2010, 242 projects were completed with a total cost of US$9.7
million, benefitting 67,788 persons.
- Inclusive and Special Education: 90 projects have been carried out at a total cost of
US$3.7 million, targeting 16,235 beneficiaries (47 percent female).
- Educational Outreach to include the Rural Areas: Ten (10) projects have been carried
out at a total cost of US$682,643, aimed at training and rehabilitating 155 people of the
associations and schools' staff and at integrating 157 children (male and female).
- Early Childhood Development: 17 projects have been completed at a total cost of
US$518,885, targeting 643 beneficiaries; 50 percent of them were children (boys and
girls).
- Community-Based Rehabilitation: 7 projects were completed at a total cost of
US$160,154, targeting 193 disabled persons
- Protection: This program focuses on improving the services provided by the prisons
and social welfare centers. 66 projects were completed.
- Institutional Support and Capacity Building: 56 projects have been carried out at a
total cost of US$1.4 million.
- Policies & Strategies Support: SFD in cooperation with the World Bank continued its
support to the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labor and the Ministry of Planning and
International Cooperation, in the preparation of the National Disability Strategy. SFD
also supported the preparation of the Social Protection Strategy, the development of the
National Disability Strategy, and the Strategy of the Disability of Welfare and
Rehabilitation Fund. Moreover, SFD supported the Child Labor Survey 2008.
- Technical & Vocational Education and Training: 6 projects have been carried out at a
total cost of US$251,356, aiming to build the capacity of the staff working in the
governmental and non-governmental institutions that provide vocational rehabilitation
programs for those with special needs.

B.      Lessons learned:
-    The significance of focusing on early detection and intervention services.
-    The expansion of the services of the rural outreach and community-based
rehabilitation.
-    Focusing on the interventions in the preventive aspect, whether for disabled people,
orphans, juveniles, street children, working children, victimized children or for smuggled
children.

2.1.7 Cultural Heritage (CH)

A. Achievements:
- While saving, documenting and restoring/rehabilitating more than 50 endangered
historic sites and monuments, SFD has implemented 105 projects. More than 1500 master



                                           72
builders, 430 architects and archaeologists gained skills and increased their knowledge
against a target of 1000 and 350 for each category of professionals respectively.
- Contributed to the national efforts for protecting Yemeni cultural heritage especially
in the three historic cities inscribed in the World Heritage (i.e. Sana’a, Shibam and Zabid)
whereby endangered major elements of their urban fabric were protected.
- There is a significant increase in the demand on some of the traditional handicrafts as
a result of the promotion and technical advice extended to the crafts people by SMEPS in
collaboration with C.H. and SMED units.
- Both Ministry of Culture and Ministry of Higher Education positively responded and
formally agreed to consider integrating standard conservation curricula into professional
education at the university under and post graduate level.
- Ministry of Endowment also established a department for Historic Mosques to give
them special attention (in response to SFD’s formal request after targeted sensitization)

B.      Lesson learned: Diversity of C.H. operations and careful implementation
approach produced a number of lessons, most importantly:
- In light of the lack of experience and qualification of typical civil works contractors
to handle the delicate works of restoration and archeology, detailed sound
implementation mechanisms were needed and helped allow a smooth, acceptable and
quality execution of projects.
- The importance of direct linking of cultural heritage activities to poverty alleviation
through focusing on income generation and employment for securing steady financial
and political support from various stakeholders.

2.1.8 Integrated Intervention Program (IIP). In the light of the 2004 evaluation of the
first pilot phase results, which proved the success of the experiment, the SFD moved to
the second phase of the program, which covers 8 areas targeting 63,000 people. The IIP
has carried out about 154 projects distributed over various sectors at a total cost of
US$8,237,090.

A. Achievements:
- Implementing the program in a broader geographical framework to serve a larger
number of beneficiaries and improve the follow-up efforts (expansion in two areas -
targeting six new areas).
- Creating a database related to inputs of the IIP.
- Enhancing the building of social capital, strengthening community action and
broadening the base of community participation through the formation of community-
based sustainable entities (development committees, community entities, fathers and
mothers’ councils, health committees, agricultural and economic groups, etc.) and
bringing a real change in the target community trends.
- Preparing SFD branches to implement the program.

B.     Lesson learned:
 - Taking advantage of the social and economic change in the poorest areas through
expansion into new areas as the IIP has had significant positive impact on these areas.



                                            73
 - Focusing on specific projects that contribute directly to social change more than
economic infrastructure projects.
 - IIP must be harmonized with other SFD programs as this helps enhance the
achievement of the objectives of the program.

2.2     SMALL AND MICRO ENTERPRISES DEVELOPMENT (SMED). Small
and micro enterprise (SME) development continues to be the core business of the SMED
unit. The basic principle forming SMED's outlook towards the microfinance sector is the
creation of the necessary conditions for microfinance institutions to become strong,
competitive, and sustainable entities, both financially and institutionally.

A.     Achievements

2.2.1 Macro level:
- SFD encouraged and facilitated the development of Law #15 on Microfinance Banks,
which was prepared by the Central Bank of Yemen.
- The successful development of the SME strategy in 2004, which was approved by the
Council of Ministries in January 2005. The Strategy, in turn, resulted in the development
of the National Microfinance Strategy and Action-Plan in December 2008, which revised
in July 2010.
- There were several contributions aimed at raising awareness through the following
activities: The Annual Enterprise Days, the 4th Sanabel Annual Microfinance Conference,
and a number of workshops, seminars and conferences.

2.2.2 Meso Level:
- SFD became the caretaker of the government of Yemen’s share (45 percent) in the
newly established Al-Amal Microfinance Bank, which was initiated by the Saudi
sponsored AGFUND. The bank is already making a dent in the market and became the
2nd largest MFI in Yemen in terms of active borrowers.
- During the 3rd phase SMED’s intervention constituted providing to or helping MFIs
obtain direct technical assistance, such as consultancies and creation and development of
systems (e.g. Maeen loan tracking system).
- SFD established the Small and Micro Enterprises Promotion Services (SMEPS) in
2005. Some of SMEPS interventions include: new business lines; sub-sector studies
(value chain analysis); Technical Advisory Stations (TAS); specialized training courses;
Know About Business (KAB); upgrading consultancy services and links to SMEs; local
and international exhibitions; and exposure visits.
- SMED established the Yemen Microfinance Network (YMN) in August 2009. The
effort was co-financed by the UNDP, and YMN started its operations in 2010.
- SMED has also entered into partnerships with some private banks, such as Al-Amal
Microfinance Bank, Al-Kureimi Islamic Microfinance Bank, Al-Tadhamon Islamic Bank,
which has a small and microfinance program of its own, and the Cooperative Agricultural
and Credit (CAC) Bank.
- Finally, a partnership has been established internally in SFD with the Cultural
Heritage unit, as well as the Training and Organizational Support Unit and SMEPS to
promote traditional handicrafts.


                                           74
2.2.3 Micro Level:
2.2.3.1 Small Enterprises: Financing Small Enterprises: An evaluation of the Small
Enterprises Development Fund (SEDF) carried out in April 2003 with the help of a
banking consultant resulted in the decision of SMED to extend a helping hand to this
very important institution in Yemen. Several agreements for technical assistance, grants
and loans have been signed ever since between SFD and SEDF, and have resulted in a
dramatic improvement in SEDF operations and targeting.

2.2.3.2 Microfinance: Development of several microfinance institutions and programs in
Yemen.
    1. The National Microfinance Foundation (NMF), established in October 2003
    2. Aden and Abyan Programs, established in June 2005 and October 2003
        respectively
    3. Sana’a MF program, established in October 2001
    4. Wadi Hadramaut /Seyoun program, established in May 2000
    5. MicroStart II Programs

2.2.4 National Small and Microenterprise Development Strategy. During 2004, the SFD
prepared the National Small and Microenterprise Development Strategy, as well as a
five-year action plan for its implementation.

2.3    CAPACITY BUILDING. This program activities targeted governmental
organizations, local authorities, local communities, non-governmental organizations
(NGOs), and private sector/individuals.

2.3.1 Governmental Organizations
-    Institutional development assessments: Several of these targeted central and local
governmental organizations including ministries' main offices of governorates and
districts.
-    Executive By-Law for the Law of State Tenders & Auctions: The By-Law drafting
committee had requested the SFD to review, comment on, and make necessary
amendments to the articles concerning the implementation of small works through the
community and NGOs, included in the By-Law draft.

2.3.2 Local Authority
- A national training program was established targeting the members of all local
councils in all districts including members of local councils' administrative committees at
the district level, and the plans and budgets' committees. The over-all number of
participants reached 8,000.
- The SFD participated with other donors including the UNDP in financing the
Decentralization & Local Development Support Program. The SFD took over the full
responsibility of supporting 10 districts from the total number of 26 districts.
- The SFD participated in preparing the National Strategy for Local Development &
the Executive Program of the Strategy.



                                            75
- The SFD participated in the designing of and implementing the Empowerment for
Local Development (ELD) Program. All SFD branches contributed to the Program,
covering about 21 districts and 1230 villages in various governorates.

2.3.3 Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs). An assessment of SFD investment in
Yemeni NGOs was conducted in early 2009. The assessment found that SFD has
significantly contributed to strengthening the capacity of 351 NGOs, playing a
particularly critical role in supporting organizations that operate outside of main urban
areas. It also reiterated that such support is one of the few sources of funding for many
organizations, particularly those operating outside of the main urban areas. 24

2.3.4 Private Sector – Individuals. A number of bee-keepers (6,275) were trained in the
3rd phase, and about 874 contractors have also received training.

2.3.5 National Program for Qualifying Newly Graduated Rural University Students in
Voluntary Work. The overall number of volunteers trained during the Third Phase
reached 3,810. They were involved in various projects such as formation and training of
committees, identification and assessment of needs, P.R.A., and the implementation of
the Empowerment for Local Development Program.

2.4    LABOR INTENSIVE WORKS. This SFD program was created in response to a
government mandate to implement labor intensive projects that also provide temporary
job opportunities to unskilled and semiskilled workers. In recent years SFD has
developed two workfare 25 programs.

The LIWP Program is financed by the government of Yemen, and seeks to create 8-10
million days of employment from 2006–2010. As of the end of 2009, the program created
about 4.6 million temporary job opportunities in urban and semi-urban areas. In 2009, 40
projects were approved at an estimated cost of US$13.4 million. Some 718,000 job
opportunities are expected to be created by these projects.

Global Food Crisis Response Program. In 2008, the Republic of Yemen and the World
Bank signed a US$10 million grant agreement, to be used by SFD to create job
opportunities by implementing labor-intensive public works projects through a cash-for-
work approach. Accordingly, SFD developed 98 projects to provide income to
communities most affected by rising food prices, with US$9.1 million of the grant
allocated for this purpose. Projects included: constructing rainwater harvesting (cisterns,
natural tanks and stone tanks); improving and protecting existing rural roads; protecting
drinking water sources (shallow wells and springs); paving public rural markets;
protecting irrigation channels; improving and reclaiming agricultural land; and

  Workfare is an alternative model to conventional social welfare systems. There are two main types of
workfare: those that encourage direct employment to get individuals off the welfare roll directly into the
workforce, and those that are intended to increase human capital by providing training and education to
those currently in the welfare system.

                                                   76
rehabilitating and restoring agricultural terraces. In addition US$900,000 of the
mentioned grant was utilized in building the capacity of the Social Welfare Fund.

A. Achievements:
- Developed a focus in the Global Food Crisis Response Project designed to raise
awareness about the adverse health, nutrition and environmental impact of qat. Two
training courses were held to raise awareness of malnutrition and qat in Sana'a and Aden
with 58 trainees. Trainees then conducted field visits to 98 projects in the target areas to
launch the awareness campaigns. Field follow-up visits sought to assess awareness
campaign performance and effectiveness of the methods used to identify weaknesses and
strengths.
- Conducted a qualitative study 26 in August/September 2009, which was designed to
assess results of LIWP interventions, seeking to measure efficiency, sustainability and
beneficiary impact. Additionally, the study was developed to contribute to the design and
implementation of the upcoming quantitative assessment that will be conducted on the
program. Twelve projects were visited in eight governorates (Sana’a, Hajjah, Ibb, Al-
Hudaidah, Taiz, Lahej, Al-Mahweet and Raimah). The results of this study subsequently
contributed to shaping of SFD Phase IV planning for investments in this sector.
-

3.     IMPLEMENTING AGENCY (SFD) PERFORMANCE. SFD is recognized by
donors as innovative, effective and efficient in delivering well-targeted basic services. It
has a pro-poor distribution of resources and is deemed a model of good practice in terms
of transparency, efficiency and effort to be poverty focused. Without exception, all
government – both central and governorate – and NGOs consider that SFD is an action-
oriented organization, working on a national basis providing support to all districts
throughout the country widely targeting remote areas. SFD’s capacity building initiatives
support governorates and districts implementing the decentralization policy. In addition,
it supports the development of the NGO sector to improve service delivery. SFD is an
example of good governance, in particular, through its appropriate and transparent
administrative, management, financial and procedures systems, that have influenced other
government agencies to adjust their procedures.

3.1       Internal Capacity Building

Fostering staff development. SFD staff participated in many courses, workshops and
conferences during the third phase. In May 2010, SFD board of directors approved its
updated operational manual that included the official creation of Research and
Development Unit and Human Resources Unit. Research and Development unit activities
have started by recruiting an RD unit head in September 2010. SFD is in the process of
establishing the Human Resources Development unit and a call for interest was
announced early in 2010, and then the contract was signed with an International
Consultancy firm in order to support SFD with the establishment of the SFD HR unit.

     Labor-Intensive Works Program Beneficiary Impact Study (Phase I)


                                               77
Hajjah Branch Office Opening. In 2009, SFD management made the decision to add a
branch office for the Governorate of Hajjah thereby increasing the number of SFD branch
offices to nine. This strategic decision was made primarily on the basis of need, as Hajjah
is one of the most rural governorates in the country, has high levels of poverty and very
limited basic services.

Gender Mainstreaming Strategy. During 2007 the SFD developed the Gender
Mainstreaming Strategy and Framework, which aims to increase the quality and
effectiveness of SFD contributions to sustainable poverty reduction (for both sexes)—
with a focus on increasing gender sensitization in SFD policies and procedures as well as
interventions and sector programs. The strategy includes a three-year action plan and
tools for its implementation as well as program and sector indicators to measure its
impact.

SFD Communications Strategy: “Communication for Change?. In 2009 SFD carried out
an extensive consultative process to develop a communications strategy for the
organization. The goal of the process was to more clearly communicate knowledge,
experience and lessons learned to a wider audience, with a view to influence positive
changes in attitudes and practices of various development actors in Yemen.

The following are some other major activities of SFD:
   - Conducting Impact Evaluation and institutional evaluation studies (2006 and
        2009) by independent international firms
   - Improving SFD management information system and integrating SFD III output
        indicators
   - Developing a system for funding management
   - Improving SFD Geographical Information System (GIS) and integrating national
        data from the Census 2004 and Household’s Budget (2005-2006) survey to it

3.2     Mobilization and Use of Funds. Due to its credibility amongst development
partners, SFD mobilized for the 3rd Phase US$909 million until August 31st, 2010
against the planned US$963 million. Its accounting, financial and procurement
procedures are recognized by all donors including the World Bank to be transparent and
cost-effective. Quality of sub-projects is high while unit costs remain low despite cost
increases due to price escalation of construction materials and increased labor costs.
SFD’s operation costs (4.7 percent) are considered as one of the lowest of all SIFs.

4.     THE WORLD BANK AND OTHER CO-FINANCIERS’ PERFORMANCE.
Since the creation of SFD in 1997, the World Bank has been the lead donor in providing
financial and technical assistance, supporting the management team to make SFD a
successful program in Yemen. During the 1st ,2nd and 3rd phase, SFD has been working
with funding provided by a variety of multilateral and bilateral sources: World Bank,
Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development, Saudi Fund for Development, Sultana
Oman (through Arab Fund), Kuwaiti Fund for Development, DFID, European Union,
Dutch Government, OPEC Fund for International Development, American Government,


                                            78
Islamic Development Bank, Italian Government, German Government, International
Fund for Agricultural Development, United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization, Yemen Liquid Natural Gas Company and Government of Yemen.

In general, SFD’s relationship with donors is excellent and to assess the performance of
the different financiers, several factors should be considered such as flow of funds,
support, technical assistance, responsiveness and flexibility. These factors are essential
for a SIF as its main function is to respond quickly to different types of sub-project
requests forwarded from the grassroots and to adjust swiftly according to institutional
reforms.

4.1    Technical Support and Supervision. The World Bank and DFID were the lead
financiers contributing to the development of SFD providing continuous support. The
World Bank has supported SFD in auditing and improving its procurement guidelines.
DFID has also financed the development of the HR section, Impact and Institutional
Evaluations, developing SFD communication strategy, and improving SFD GIS. In
addition, KfW provides SFD with a technical assistant to implement its Gender
mainstreaming strategy. From the SFD point of view the Bank performance is rated
highly satisfactory at playing a proactive role in conducting an appraisal for the 3rd
Phase that forms the foundation, which has encouraged other donors to participate in
supporting SFD.

The project has been well supervised by the Bank, along with the U.K. Department for
International Development (DFID), German Development Bank, and Royal Netherlands
Embassy in Sana’a who conducted a semi-annual joint review missions to assess progress
on projects from the SFD’s activities, impact Evaluation as well as the mid-term vision
and overall progress on its third phase.

4.2     Donors’ Contribution. While the 3rd Phase has started in 2004, most of the
sources of fund were effective: the World Bank, Organization for Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC), European Commission, International Fund for Agricultural
Development (IFAD), Saudi Fund for Development, and DFID, Germany and the
Netherlands. By the end of 2005, a US$219 million had been secured which was two-
thirds of the external funding required for the third phase. Later in 2008, new grants were
received from the Dutch Government to support the International Finance Corporation,
and the U.K. Government added £43.3 million to the £19.8 million agreement that was
signed previously to support the third phase operations. Additional grant agreements were
signed with Oman, the Saudi Fund for Development, World Bank (for the Global Food
Crisis Response Program) and a small grant was received from UNESCO, Italian
Government, French Government, and Yemen Liquid Natural Gas Company.

4.3     Flow of Funds and Flexibility in Resource Allocation. The flow of funds has
improved during the 3rd Phase although SFD had to advance funds on some occasions as
replenishment of funds by some donors was delayed. Regarding the Bank’s lending,
replenishment was smooth and on time. OPEC and Kuwait Fund had difficulties with
some internal procedures that caused a major delay in fund utilization.


                                            79
SFD is applying different financial and contractual procedures for certain donors while
others such as the Dutch Government, OPEC, and DFID have accepted WB procedures.
The DFID has provided un-earmarked contribution and the WB has been very flexible in
reallocating resources from one category of expenditures to another according to the
