                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The overall purpose of the program is to improve the provision of infrastructure services in the Province within a framework offiscal responsibility. Through improved
                         services the Project aims to support the return to a sustainable path of economic growth, to alleviate poverty and to increase social equity. To this end, the Province
                         prioritized a set of interventions through the sector wide Infrastructure Program for the period 2005-2012 specifically aimed to:
                         i. Develop a multi-year public expenditure program, in line with the priorities of the Province, to implement the InfrastructureProgram following sound fiscal policies to
                         ensure convergencetowards a long-term sustainable fiscal framework.
                         ii. Improve and maintain high priority segments of the non-concessioned paved road network to support the reactivation of the provincial economy and strengthen
                         regional competitiveness.
                         iii. Enhance access to water, sewerage, sanitation and urban drainage services, especially for the low-income segments of the population living in highly vulnerable
                         areas of the Conurbano Bonaerense.
                         The specific Project Development Objective is to improve the social and environmental welfare of approximately 5,000,000 people through the improved provision of
                         transport, water and sanitation and drainage services.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         1. This ISR covers the period of June to December 2012. It includes the main findings of the supervision mission carried out in December 2012.

                         2. As a reminder, in October 2012 a restructuring was approved to transfer one road work and four Water Service and Sanitation (WSS) works ongoing under the second Adaptable
                         Program Loan (APL2) to the APL1, due to lack of funding for completion of these activities under the current Loan. The corresponding adjustments were made to the Project’s
                         indicators and amounts were reassigned between the Loan’s disbursement categories, in an amendment to the Loan Agreement effective October 17, 2012.

                         3. The project remains on track to achieve its development objectives of enhancing the welfare of people in the Province of Buenos Aires through improving the provision of
                         infrastructure services. The implementation of works has advanced since the last ISR sequence, and all infrastructure works are either completed or under execution. Of the works
                         remaining under the Project as of the October 2012 restructuring, 14 of the 15 road works and all WSS works (12) were completed. The execution of the only drainage work financed
                         under this project was 84.79 percent completed.

                         4. The less advanced components are the technical assistance ones. Of the 27 studies and technical feasibility activities planned for a total of US$9.4M, 13 are finished, 7 are
                         underway, and 5 have entered the bidding stage (for a total of US$7.7M). An additional 2 technical assistance activities are at the planning stage.

                         5. USD 258.31 million (96 percent) of the revised loan amount has been disbursed.

                         6. Regarding social and environmental safeguards, the Province continues to provide adequate attention to these aspects under the Project and no safeguards issues have occurred
                         since the last ISR. Additionally, a socio-environmental workshop was held prior to the December 2012 supervision mission and attended by 27 people from various parts of the
                         different coordinating units and implementing agencies. This event resulted in a rich exchange of ideas, identified areas in need of improvement, and generally highlighted that social
                         and environmental considerations are being effectively integrated into implementation of subprojects.
