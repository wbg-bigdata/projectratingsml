                         The overall purpose of the program is to improve the provision of infrastructure services in the Province within a framework offiscal responsibility. Through improved
                         services the Project aims to support the return to a sustainable path of economic growth, to alleviate poverty and to increase social equity. To this end, the Province
                         prioritized a set of interventions through the sector wide Infrastructure Program for the period 2005-2012 specifically aimed to:
                         i. Develop a multi-year public expenditure program, in line with the priorities of the Province, to implement the InfrastructureProgram following sound fiscal policies to
                         ensure convergencetowards a long-term sustainable fiscal framework.
                         ii. Improve and maintain high priority segments of the non-concessioned paved road network to support the reactivation of the provincial economy and strengthen
                         regional competitiveness.
                         iii. Enhance access to water, sewerage, sanitation and urban drainage services, especially for the low-income segments of the population living in highly vulnerable
                         areas of the Conurbano Bonaerense.
                         The specific Project Development Objective is to improve the social and environmental welfare of approximately 5,000,000 people through the improved provision of
                         transport, water and sanitation and drainage services.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The purpose of this ISR is to reflect the level two restructuring approved by the Country Director on October 10, 2012. The proposed changes included the following: (i) reducing the
                         scope of the civil work components to reflect cost increases; (ii) revising the target values of project indicators to account for the revised project scope; and (iii) reallocating project
                         costs among components and loan proceeds among categories accordingly. The information on project implementation and the progress toward achieving the Project Development
                         Objective (PDO) in this ISR reflects the status of the project in June 2012. The information will be updated after the next supervision mission planned for December 2012.
