                                     RESTRUCTURING PAPER

A. SUMMARY
1.     This is a proposal to restructure the Buenos Aires Infrastructure Sustainable
Investment Development Adaptable Program Loan, specifically the APL2 (P105288),
The APL1 (P088032) of the Program, which includes an Additional Financing, is also
being restructured in parallel, through a separate Project Paper.

2.       The proposed restructuring, jointly with the restructuring proposed in parallel for
the APL 1 (and additional financing – AF), will update the Program funding structure and
its activities to the current context, thus providing the grounds for an adequate and timely
Program implementation, aiming at full achievement of the Project Development
Objectives of both APLs (I and II). The changes are necessary because of considerable
increases in construction costs in Argentina, which is affecting the availability of funds to
finance the works initially foreseen in the Program (both APLs), thus justifying the
present restructuring.

3.      The proposed changes described in this Project Paper include the following: (i)
reducing the scope of the civil work components to reflect cost increases; (ii) revising the
target values of project indicators to account for the revised project scope; and (iii)
reallocating project costs among components and loan proceeds among categories
accordingly.

B. PROJECT STATUS
4.      The US$514 million Buenos Aires Infrastructure Sustainable Investment
Development Adaptable Program Loan (APL) to improve infrastructure services in the
Province of Buenos Aires within a framework of fiscal responsibility consists of APL1
(P088032) in the amount of US$200 million, which includes Additional Financing (AF)
in the amount of US$50 million, and this operation (APL2 - P105288) in the amount of
US$264 million.

5.      The Project Development Objective (PDO) of APL2 is to improve the social and
environmental welfare of approximately five million people living in the Borrower’s
territory through the improved provision of transport, water supply and sanitation (WSS),
and drainage services.

6.      Project implementation and progress towards achieving the PDO have
consistently been rated satisfactory. To date, 12 out of 16 road works and 11 out of 16
WSS interventions have been finalized satisfactorily. The remaining road works and the
WSS interventions are respectively 77% and 79% completed1. The road network is in
good condition, providing better mobility in more than 10 roads of the province of
Buenos Aires. The WSS interventions benefitted so far over 200,000 people, who have
access to sewerage lines and new water services. The drainage work is 72% completed

and 942 ha of land has already proper drainage. Under the institutional components, 10 of
the 22 activities and studies are completed, four are ongoing, four are in the bidding
phase, and three are in the planning phase. The loan is 94% disbursed and its closing date
is August 15, 2012.

C. PROPOSED CHANGES
7.      The proposed changes include the following: (i) reducing the scope of the civil
work components to reflect increased costs; (ii) revising the target values of project
indicators to account for the revised project scope; and (iii) reallocating project costs
among components and loan proceeds among categories accordingly. The proposed
changes are described below in detail.

Reduction in the Scope of Civil Work Components and Adjustment of Project
Indicator Targets
8.      Due to significant construction cost increases and hard budget constraints, the
Borrower will not be able to finance the completion of all ongoing civil works under this
project. The table below shows the works that cannot be completed under APL2, their
degree of completion in physical and financial terms on June 30, 2012, and the activities
and amounts still to be executed.

9.      Technically, it does not make sense to leave ongoing sanitation and road works
unfinished when the AF loan under APL 1 still has an uncommitted balance to complete
these civil works. Consequently, the outstanding works described in the table above for a
                                                                                                5
total amount of US$16,252,432 will be canceled from the scope of Components 1 and 2
of APL2 and will be financed with funds of APL1/AF (a restructuring of APL1/AF is
being processed in parallel). The project’s Operational Manual will be updated to reflect
the cut-off of works to be financed under APL2 and APL1/AF.

10.     This reduction in the scope will reduce the project end target values of five
custom project indicators and three core indicators as shown in Annex 1 Results
Framework and Monitoring. As examples, the target of the outcome indicator HT IRI2
will increase from > 3.3 to >3.73; and the target of the outcome indicator related to
number of beneficiaries from WSS access will reduce from 196,130 to 167,706.
Additionally, taking the opportunity of the current restructuring process, a sixth core
indicator that has already been monitored in the ISRs will be formalized through its
inclusion in Annex 1.

11.    Since the restructuring under APL2 basically consists of a reduction in scope of
civil works, it has no implications in terms of procurement, safeguards and
implementation arrangements.

12.     The fact that the APL 2 finishes before the APL 1/AF does not represent
additional risks to the implementation schedule, since the unfinished APL 2 works that
are being transferred to the APL 1/AF have a cut-off date of June 30, 2012; and other
remaining works financed with APL 2 funds are well advanced and should be concluded
by the current APL 2 closing date (August 15, 2013).

*The baseline and target values for these two indicators have a one-year lag due to their calculation mode. The Borrower’s current severe financial constraints together with
the rapidly increasing construction costs in Argentina have reduced the total amount of road rehabilitation and maintenance works on the road network. This has worsened
the road conditions and justifies an increase of the project end target values of the outcome indicator related to the preservation of high traffic (HT) road assets.
