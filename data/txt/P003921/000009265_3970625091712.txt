INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN OF IUS$270 MILLION
TO THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA
FOR AN URBAN SECTOR LOAN
1. The following report on a proposed loan to the Republic of Indonesia for
US$270 million equivalent is submitted for approval.  The loan would have a
term of 20 years, including 5 years' grace, at the standard variable interest
rate, and would assist in financing the Covernment's efforts in urban infra-
structure and institutional development.
2.  Background.  Over the coming decade it is expected that two thirds of
Indonesia's population growth will occur in urban areas. From its 1980 level
of 33 million or 22% of total, the urban population is expected to reach some
76 million or 36% of total by the year 2000. Recent studies indicate the
urban infrastructure funding required to support urban growth during the
current Repelita IV (1984-89) to be some Rp900 billion/year.  Since a modest
start in Repelita I (1969-74) with the very successful 'Kampung Improvement
Program (KIP)' of basic infrastructure in a few cities costing less than
Rp 100 billion/year, the Government has, through subsequent Repelitas, devel-
oped increasingly broader urban development strategies. To date, some basic
needs programs in water supply, sanitation, and urban roads, as well as KIP,
have been implemented in a total of 700 cities and towns. These programs were
designed during a period of abundant resources to be mainly centrally funded
and implemented but, not only are current urban infrastructure expenditures of
some Rp 500 billion/year inadequate to meet the needs of the sector, there are
now insufficient Central Government resources since the recent sharp oil price
decline to sustain even the present sector expenditure program. The Government
of Indonesia (GOI) recognizes that future financing of the expanding urban
sector's infrastructure needs must rely more on local government resources and
has initiated reforms placing greater emphasis on local resource mobilization
and municipal borrowing. Resource utilization efficiency is also being add-
ressed through better planning and programming, and the roles of sector
agencies are being redefined to better address local government institutional
development. An interagency coordination team has been formed under the
chairmanship of the National Development Planning Agency, BAPPENAS, to guide
the future sector policy and coordinate development.
3.  Project Objectives.  The project would help sustain the momentum of the
GOI's urban sector investment and operations and maintenance (O&M) program for
the next two years, and help guide the sector program preparation for the
medium term.    It would also support the strengthening of sector institutions
to handle rapidly growing service needs; improve local resource mobilization;
and incree.e the responsibilities of local governments for urban infrastruc-
ture planning, financing and implementation.
4.   Project Description.  The project would include (a) a sector expenditure
program for infrastructure investments and O&M in water supply, flood protec-
tion, sanitation, roads, and Kampung improvement in urbanized areas of about
300 local governments during GOI FY87/88 and FY88/89; and (b) an Action Plar.
of measures initiating the longer-term reforms and improvements required to



- 2 -
support the GOI's urban development policy objectives as defined by an agreed
Statement of Policies for Urban Development. It would support significant
sector reforms reflecting COI's declared sector policy of developing local
government capabilities, reducing Central Government's share of urban infra-
structure financing by increasing local resource mobilization, and increasing
efficicncy by improving resource utilization. Specific measures would be taken
under a GOI Action Plan to (a) improve property tax and local revenue genera-
tion, (b) introduce an improved source of loan funds for local governments
which would rationalize lending terms and appraisal processing, (c) strengthen
urban expenditure planning, programming and coordination, and (d) prepare an
urban sector manpower development plan. Technical assistance and training
would be provided under the project to support the Action Plan and assist in
project management.
5.   The total project cost is estimated to be about US$1.0 billion equivalent,
including estimated taxes of US$43 million equivalent and estimated direct and
indirect foreign exchange costs equivalent to US$400 million (40% of the total
project cost). The proposed Bank lohn of US$270 million equivalent would cover
25% of the agreed two-year expenditure program (US$963 million) and 100% of
property valuations, technical assistance and training costs (US$43 million)
in support of the Action Plan, net of taxes (details are given in Schedule A).
The proposed loan, together with existing donor commitments including ongoing
Bank loans, would finance about 58% of total project costs. About 60% of the
loan would be disbursed through a Special Account to be established in Bank
lndonesia. Disbursements would be made against Statements of Expenditure. In
order to simplify disbursement, US$70 million (about 25% of the loan proceeds)
would be disbursed to GOI against Statements of Expenditures for a positive
list of imports.  Retroactive financing up to US$27 million would be provided
for eligible expenditures commencing April 1, 1987. Eligible expenditures are
mainly small civil works spread over 300 local authorities and would conform to
local procurement procedures satisfactory to the Bank except contracts exceed-
ing US$5 million, which would be subject to International Competetive Bidding
procedures. Procurement and disbursement arrangements are summarized in Sche-
dule B. The project would be executed jointly by the Ministries of Public
Works, Finance and Home Affairs under the guidance of the interagency Coordina-
ting Team chaired by the National Development Planning Agency, and assisted by
suitable project management and implementation arrangements. Staff Appraisal
Report No. 6598-IND is being distributed separately.
6.   Rationale for Bank Involvement.  Experience of the sector gained since
1974 through eleven urban and water supply projects (five of which are com-
plete), and an Urban Services Sector Report (No.4800-IND) prepared in 1984, has
established a comprehensive dialogue on sectoral reform in the key areas to be
addressed.  The operation would build upon this well-established dialogue and
extend policies and procedures developed under previous Bank-assisted projects,
as well as apply important lessons learned on programming and institutional
development. The Bank's experience and advice on the reform program would help
GOI address key issues adequately and assist the agencies involved. A timetable
of key preparation events is given in Schedule C and the status of Bank Group
operations in Indonesia in Schedule D.
7.   Actions Agreed.   COI has adopted a Statement of Policies for Urban



Development acceptable to the Bank, and established an interagency Coordinating
Team with an executive secretariate to oversee and guide sector development.
Assurances were obtained during negotiations that: (a) GOI would provide the
necessary funds for the agreed two-year expenditure program (which would not be
materially amended without tha agreement of the Bank), specifically, the agreed
budget for FY87/88 would be allocated as a condition of effectiveness, and an
agreed FY88/89 budget allocation would be confirmed by GOI as a condition of
second-year's disbursement; and (b) the agreed two-year Action Plan of monitor-
able policy and institutional reforms, to be reviewed annually with the Bank,
would be implemented by the Ministries of Finance, Public Works and Home Af-
fairs under the direction of the interagency Coordinating Team, with the assis-
tance of consultants and according to agreed timetables for: (i) measures to
lay the foundation for an increase in revenues from property tax, municipal
taxes and specific user charges in urban areas; (ii) establishment of an im-
proved mechanism for municipal borrowings; (iii) development of planning, pro-
gramming and appraisal criteria and guidelines for Ministry of Public Works and
local governments to be used in formulation of major urban infrastructure pro-
grams, and preparation of a 5-year sector expenditure program; and (iv) related
institutional development measures, including preparation of a local government
manpower development plan.
8. Justification. Central government financial transfers currently account
for some 75% of sector expenditures.  Incentives for local participation are
weak and local resources underutilized. Coping with service backlogs and urban
growth of over 2.2 million persons per year in over 300 local governments
would benefit from the decentralization of responsibility and strengthening of
local government capabilities supported by the project, as well as the
sustained momentum of the infrastructure expenditure program. Sustained urban
development would contribute to national development priorities.
9. Risks. The principal risks are: (a) the expenditure program may be
implemented more slowly than expected; and (b) the short-term measures in-
cluded in the Action Plan may be prolonged by the difficulties of policy and
institutional change. The expenditure program has been reviewed with partic-
ular reference to the absorptive capacity of the various implementing agen-
cies in order to minimize delay risks. Project progress would be reviewed
thoroughly at mid-term to assess first year performance and confirm the second
year expendicure program. Progress in the Action Plan would be facilitated by
consultant assistance and monitored closely. GOI has established adequate
monitoring arrangements to help ensure that satisfactory progress is achieved.
10. Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and I recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
