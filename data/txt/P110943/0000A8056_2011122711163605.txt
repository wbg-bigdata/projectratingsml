                         approved by the Bank’s Board in March, 2012). The CDP includes the original project (financed under a US$ 17.2 million - IDA grant (H409-TG) that supports community-based
                         infrastructure and income making activities (IGA); and two additional financing grants, the first supports labor intensive public works (LIPW) projects and cereal production (financed
                         under a US$7 million GFRP grant (TF093124)) and the second supports school feeding and LIPW operations (financed under a US$ 8,7 million CRW additional financing grant
                         (H6020)).

                         By November 2011, the CDP’s achievements comprise:
                         (i)        Under the original project (H409): 150 out of a total of 276 approved community-based infrastructure projects (schools, health centers, rural roads etc) have been
                         completed, 65 have had a provisional commissioning, and 61 are currently being implemented. 174 out of the 294 income making activities (IGA) have been completed (the
                         beneficiary groups are managing the IGA without more project support) and 121 IGA are currently being implemented (the project supports the set up of the activity and/or the training
                         of the beneficiary groups).
                         (ii)      Under the two additional financing grants: a total of 38,654 school children in 182 schools currently benefit from school feeding sub-component. IA study that will look at how
                         to scale-up and sustain the school feeding activities beyond the project (“etude sur la stratégie de pérennisation des repas scolaires?) is expected to be launched in January 2012.
                         Under the first campaign of the labor intensive public works (LIPW), almost 9000 workers (37% women) have been recruited and 917 ha have been reforested. This is below the
                         target of recruiting 13,000 temporary workers and reforesting 1,110 ha planned for the first year. The PIU had some delays in the start up phase of the new project due in particular to
                         a weak understanding of the new project procedures, in particular those related to registration and payment of beneficiaries. The payment system (by the Post offices) was both
                         inappropriate and inefficient as payments were made with long delays causing dissatisfaction and drop out among workers. A consultant is currently identifying an alternative
                         payment system for this sub-component. The project is currently trying to catch up with the initial important delays and to achieve the target of reforesting 1,110 ha. The next LIPW
                         campaign is expected to start by end December 2011/January 2012.

                         Overall disbursement rate of the original IDA grant is at 89% and of the first and second additional financing grants 88% and 36%, respectively. It is expected that all the community
                         based infrastructure projects and the income making activity projects will be completed and the funds of the original grant will be fully disbursed by June 30, 2012. The school feeding
                         operation is expected to run until June 2013 and the public works to be completed by September 2012. Under the LIPW-sub-component, the set-up of the project’s monitoring and
                         evaluation (M/E) system was launched in November, and it is expected to be finalized by mid-January 2012.
