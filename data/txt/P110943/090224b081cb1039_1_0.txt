                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The CDP consists of the original grant and two additional financing grants. The original grant of US$ 17.2 million (H409-TG) supports community-based infrastructure and income


                                                                                                                                                                                                         Page 1 of 8
                              The World Bank                                                                                                                                          Report No: ISR10442



                         generating activities (IGA). The first additional financing grant of US$7 million supports school feeding and cereal production (GFRP grant TF093124), and the second additional
                         financing grant of US$ 8.7 million under the Crisis Response Window (CRW) supports school feeding and Labor Intensive Public Works (LIPW) operations (H602-TG). School
                         feeding and LIPW are currently still under implementation.

                         Two of the grants (H409-TG and TF93124) closed on June 30, 2012. The third grant (H602-TG) is scheduled to close on June 30, 2013, but Government has requested an extension
                         of this grant until September 30, 2013 to allow completion of two studies. This grant is 99% disbursed.

                         This is the second-to-last ISR for the project. At present the project’s performance on reaching its development objectives (DO) and implementation progress (IP) is rated
                         satisfactory. In terms of relevance, achievement of project development objectives, and efficiency—the three criteria by which the project will be assessed in the Implementation
                         Completion Report (ICR)—the current assessment is as follows:

                         1.       Relevance

                         The relevance of the project is rated as High.

                         (i) Relevance of objectives. The project’s development objectives, both in the original and revised versions, are highly relevant to Togo’s development priorities and directly
                         contributed to the national goal of achieving effective and sustainable improvement of people’s living conditions by addressing the principal causes of poverty. Furthermore, the
                         project provided a timely instrument to assist the Government of Togo address its emergency needs arising from the global food, fuel and financial crisis.
                         (ii) Relevance of design. Program design was relevant given that it built on extensive experience in community-driven development in Benin. By leverage existing structures, the
                         design of the activities supported by the Additional Financing allowed for a rapid and efficient response to the crisis.
                         (iii) Relevance of Implementation. As the project was implemented, it remained relevant to the country and was flexible enough to accommodate new priorities (such as school
                         feeding and labor-intensive public works) as they emerged.

                         2.       Achievement of Project Development Objectives

                         The achievement of the Project Development Objectives is rated as Substantial.

                         As of March 2013, the CDP’s achievements include:
                         (i)         Reaching 208,486 total beneficiaries across all project activities (against a target of 199,500);
                         (ii) Completing 290 community infrastructure projects (against a target of 200). This includes 705 classrooms (benefiting 61,466 students), 81 water points (benefiting 67,652 people),
                         and 15 health posts;
                         (iii) Completing 294 income generating revenue sub-projects, benefiting 5,500 people (against targets of 150 and 1,500, respectively);
                         (iv) Providing 17,013,000 school meals to 61,466 students (against targets of 12,100,000 and 57,000, respectively);
                         (v) Providing 783,391 person days of temporary employment in labor intensive public works projects to 23,898 beneficiaries (against targets of 1,000,000 and 25,000, respectively);
                         (vi) Distributing 4,275 tons of fertilizer and 858 tons of seed to poor farmers (against targets of 4,275 and 370 tons, respectively).

                         The main remaining activities under grant H602 include (i) finalization of school feeding and LIPW activities, and (ii) completion of key studies needed to help understand and
                         evaluate the performance of the project, including a technical audit, areview of the income generating activities, an environmental and social audit, and a consultancy to review the
                         accuracy of M&E data.

                         3.       Efficiency

                         The efficiency of the project is still under examination pending completion of ongoing studies, i.e.:

                         (i) The technical audit is expected to compare the cost of social infrastructure built under the PDC with the cost of alternate methods for building similar infrastructure
                         (ii) The cost of school feeding will be compared to other similar interventions in Togo and comparable countries

                         (iii) The ratio of wages to overall sub-project costs for labor intensive public works projects will be assessed.
                         (iv) An assessment of the rates of return of income generating activities is also underway.

                         The administrative cost for implementing the PDC was 15.1 percent of total program costs, which is in line with the target of 15 percent. This appears to be in line with norms from

                         other CDD projects. For example, an IFAD study comparing administrative costs of CDD projects found costs ranging from 10 to 24 percent, with average administrative costs of 16
                         percent. Araral and Holmemo (2007) noted administrative costs of 19 percent (admin support, TA, and M&E costs) in the Bank-supported KALAHI-CIDSS Project in the Philippines.
