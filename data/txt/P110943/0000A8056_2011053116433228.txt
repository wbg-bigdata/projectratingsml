                         by two Rapid Social Response Bank-administered TFs. The original CDP is financed by an IDA Grant of US$17.2 m (H409TG); the first additional financing to H409TG is a GFRP
                         grant of US$7 million (TF093124), while the second one is a CRW additional financing to H409TG for US$8.7m (H6020). All of these Grants are disbursing and have a closing date

                         of June 30, 2013.
                         The Mid Term Review of H409TG and of the additional financing operations took place from January 22 to February 1st 2011, after intense preparation, which included five high level
                         meetings in Video conference, a final two days conference, and preparation of independent assessments.

                         The Mid Term Review rated the CDP as satisfactory both in terms of progress in achieving the PDO and of project implementation. This rating is based on the results of a series of
                         evaluations completed by the Bank and the Technical secretariat during the months preceding the MTR, including an independent technical audit, a report on compliance with
                         environmental and social safeguards and financial management and procurement assessments. Some of the key results of these assessments are summarized as follow:
                         1 - Under the original H409TG (17.2mUS$) more than 400 community sub projects have been financed, including 180 community infrastructures and 233 income generating
                         activities. Of the community infrastructures 136 have been completed and 32 are under completion. (Target at appraisal was total of 350 projects to be completed of which 200
                         infrastructures). The technical quality of projects is rated satisfactory based on the results of a technical audit conducted in all five regions. Procurement and financial management
                         are in compliance with Bank procedures, no major problem has been identified during the audits completed by the WB procurement and FM specialists in the regions. Compliance
                         with Environmental and Social safeguard procedures is still weak, but efforts have been made by the regional implementing agencies to comply with required norms and progresses
                         have been made in this area during the past months. Overall disbursement rate is satisfactory, at 66% (MTR) and 72% at time of this ISR.
                         2 - GFRP additional financing (TF093124 - 7 m US$)-The school feeding sub-component has successfully served more than 20,000 children during school year 2008/09. An
                         evaluation report is being finalized showing significant impact of the project on school indicators, both on enrollment and attendance, and on local economy. The GFRP allocation has
                         also financed an agricultural sub-component which has purchased fertilizers and seed and supported capacity building. This sub-component has achieved its objectives and made
                         significant savings which are being reallocated to the school feeding sub-component. Overall disbursement rate is satisfactory, at 77% at MTR and at 88% at the time of this ISR.
                         3 -CRW additional financing H6020 (8.7 mUS$) - The School feeding Component of the GFRP (see above) has been refinanced for two additional years with the objective of
                         servicing about 36,000 children in 180 schools of Togo, through an IDA Crisis Response Window Allocation. Under the same CRW intervention a new public works labor-intensive
                         sub-component to the CDP has been added to provide 25,000 people with temporary employment opportunities to rehabilitate small infrastructures, roads, and to support
                         reforestation. This last activity is experiencing some delays because of slow implementation of the contractual arrangements between the AGAIB # the National agency for forestry
                         (ODEF) and the postal office system which is in charge of making payments to workers. The team is closely monitoring the situation.
                         Among the assessments prepared for MTR there has been an institutional assessment which has reviewed the existing institutional arrangements of the CDP. The assessment
                         proposes specific measures to improve efficiency and project accountability. These measures include: i) revise de legal texts establishing the Steering committee, the Technical
                         secretariat and the statutes of the AGAIB to make them aligned with new or de facto role of each agency; ii) strengthen the staff of CDP, especially at the level of the Technical
                         secretariat; iii) revise the operation manuals. Especially on i) and ii) work is on-going and specific proposals will be discussed in the context of the preparation of a new CDP project.
