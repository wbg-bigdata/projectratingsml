                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The CDP includes the original project (financed under a US$ 17.2 million - IDA grant (H409-TG) that supports community-based infrastructure and income generating activities (IGA);

                         and two additional financing grants, the first supports school feeding and cereal production (financed under a US$7 million GFRP grant (TF093124)) and the second supports school
                         feeding and Labor Intensive Public Works (LIPW) operations (financed under a US$ 8,7 million CRW additional financing grant (H6020)).
                         Two of the grants IDA H409 and TF93124 will close on June 30, 2012. The third grant H6020 will close on June 30, 2013. The overall performance of the two grants closing in June
                         2102 is satisfactory, development objectives were achieved and the disbursement rate is higher than 99% for both grants. The activities financed under the third grant H6020 are

                         progressing well for the school feeding component. However, there are some delays for the Labor Intensive Public Works component due to the problems related to the payment
                         system, including significant delays in opening bank accounts for the beneficiaries and the workers are often being payed late.

                         By May 2012, the CDP's achievements comprise:
                         (i)        Under the original project (H409): 268 out of a total of 288 approved community-based infrastructure projects (schools, health centers, rural roads etc) have been completed
                         and 20 are currently being implemented. The 20 ongoing subprojects were launched over the last term and will be achieved by June 2012. Moreover, 293 income generating
                         activities (IGA) have been financed and completed.
                         (ii) Under the two additional financing grants: a total of 40,458 school children in 178 schools currently benefit from school feeding sub-component, financed by the TF93124 and
                         H6020  four schools were excluded from the project due to non-respect of procedures (182 schools were benefiting from the project during last supervision mission). A study that will
                         look at how to scale-up and sustain the school feeding activities beyond the project ("etude sur la stratgie de prennisation des repas scolaires") is expected to be launched in June
                         2012. The launching of the study had some delays due to the important delays in selecting an international consultant. Since the beginning of the LIPW project about 19,000 workers
                         have been recruited and enrollment is still ongoing for some of the reforestation activities that will take place during the rainy season (May to October 2012). However figures on the
                         number of enrolled beneficiaries, days of work and salaries paid are not very precise and may be overestimated due to the lack of an appropriate M&E system and a centralized
                         database of beneficiaries. Disbursement under the wage category is at 38%, not reflecting the number of days of work and the number of project beneficiaries provided by the project.
                         It is important for the project to develop a strong operational system that monitors the beneficiaries of safety nets. Moreover, delays with the payment of beneficiaries persist. In April
                         2012 the World Bank authorized the project to finance one to two persons working full time with the Post office to improve the situation. An alternative payment system is being
                         developed and will be adopted under the new CDSNP (Community Development and Safety Nets Project).

                         M&E remain a weakness and the data provided in the results indicator framework are still imprecise. In the previous ISR, the M/E rating was upgraded to moderately satisfactory
                         because of improvements that were made: set up of the M&E design preparation of data collection instruments and preparation of the manual. Currently the system is being
                         computerized and it is expected to be operational by end June 2012. Since the system is not operational yet, in this ISR, the rating has been downgraded to moderately
                         unsatisfactory. The rating will be upgraded as soon as the computerized system is effective and the data provided by the project are precise and verifiable.
