                         M&E has been the main weakness of the project. Progress has been made in that a monitoring and evaluation manual has been prepared and a computerized M&E system has been
                         installed in all 5 regional AGAIB offices and the Technical Secretariat. The same M/E system will also be used for the new Community Development and Safety Nets project. The
                         Bank and project Technical Secretariat have agreed on an action plan to ensure availability and accuracy of data for all indicators before project closing.
