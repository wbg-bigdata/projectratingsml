PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PAPUA NEW GUINEA: SECOND PORT PROJECT
(LOAN 1551-PNG)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) of the Second Port
Project in Papua New Guinea for which Loan 1551-PNG for US$3.5 million was
approved in April 1978. Final disbursement of the loan was made on
January 19, 1982. The report was prepared by the East Asia and Pacific
Regional Office. A PCR mission to discuss the factual basis of the report
was undertaken in May 1982 in connection with other work in the country.
The PCR is based on data supplied by the Papua New Guinea
Harbours Board (PNGHB) and on discussions with their staff during the PCR
mission. The comments of PNGHB were incorporated into the PCR prior to
its being sent to the Operations Evaluation Department (OED). The PCR was
read by OED but the project was not audited by OED staff. The draft audit
report has been sent to the borrower in the usual manner for comments; how-
ever, no further comments were received.
The assistance of officials of PNGHB is gratefully acknowledged.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PAPUA NEW GUINEA: SECOND PORT PROJECT
(Loan 1551-PNC)
RIGHLIGHTS
The purpose of the project was to expand port facilities at Port
Moresby, the country's main port, so as to provide for more efficient opera-
tions for containers and general cargo imports and exports.  In addition a
new, small, coastal port wharf was built. The work also involved reclama-
tion of land adjacent to that reclaimed under the First Port Project
(Cr. 326-PNG), and construction of three pilot lau1aches (para. 3.01).
The work was carried out with the Harhours Board as executing
agent, assisted by Consultants (Australia and PNG). Tenders for the works
at Port Moresby were awarded to an Australian firm and to a firm in Papua
New Guinea for the construction of the small coastal wharf (paras. 3.02 and 3.03).
Implementation of the project was smooth, on-time, and under
budget. The final cost of the project was US$9.0 million or 16% less than
the appraisal estimate of US$10.5 million. Of the Bank's loan of US$3.5
million, US$464,000 was cancelled, reflecting the lower than anticipated
rate of inflation which underlay the appraisal estimates.  The project was
cofinanced by the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development to the same
extent as the Bank's loan and on the same terms and conditions (para. 1.05).
The project's purpose was achieved. This is seen in improved
handling of containers up 24.5% from 1978 to 1980), reduction by half of
working time for overseas ships between 1979 and 1980 and a further reduction
in 1981, and improvement in container ship and break-bulk ship turn-around
time of 56% and 21% respectively. These improvements are reflected in the
improved financial position of the port in 1981 and in the calculated first
year economic returin of 23% - satisfactorily higher than the anticipated
overall return of 14% (paras. 6.01 and 6.02).
The Harbours Board, through the inability of a consultant not
financed under the loan to complete the study, continues to be in default
of a covenant requiring completion of a cost study to determine the cost of
services and facilities operated by the Board in each of its 16 ports.
This matter is still under review by the Bank and by the Asian Development
Bank which is pursuing the question of a costing study under the terms of
its recent loan for finance of the Lae Tidal Basin Project (para. 5.04).



PAPUA NEW GUINEA
SECOND PORTS PROJECT
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I.   INTRODUCTION
1.01      Ports and shipping play an important role in the transport sector
of Papua New Guinea (PNG). There are no railways and the exising road net-
work is not well developed. Most of the 600 or so islands constituting PNG
are mountainous and coastal plains are either narrow, terminating abruptly
in formidable mountain ranges or low lying, swampy, and intersected by major
rivers.
1.02      Port Moresby is the second largest of PNGs ports, serves the
National Capital area, and handles a large percentage of the Australian
trade, which is containerized. Prior to the project, the facilities
existing for handling containers consisted of a "T" head jetty (The Main
Wharf) with a design load too low for efficient container handling and
limited remaining life. An open storage area provided under the Bank's
First Ports Project (Cr. 326-PNG) did provide some container parking space,
but required transfer of the containers from the main wharf, an expensive
and time consuring operation. No land was available for expansion in the
area of the main wharf.
1.03      Up to January 1982, Barnk Group assistance to PNG, in addition to
the project under review, has consisted of six loans (US$67.5 million) and
seven development credits (US$48.2 million). 80% of total Bank Group assis-
tance has been for infrastructure development: power, telecommunications,
highways and por_s. Agriculture (mainaly oil palm and livestock development)
and one education project have absorbed the remaining 20%.
1.04      This is the completion report for the Bank's Second Ports Project
(Loan 1551-PNG). It is based upon Bank staff supervision mission reports,
the Bank appraisal report No. 1710a - PNG and information provided by the
Papua New Guinea Harbours Board (PNGHB).
1.05      The Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development (KFAED) agreed to
cofinance with the Bank on a 50-50 basis the foreign exchange requirements
of the project on the same terms and conditions as the Bank Loan.
Consequently, disbursement by each lene.ng agency was for 50% of every
approved claim submitted by PNGHB.

II. PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
2.01      In D)ecember 1974, consultants (Australia) completed on behalf of
the Government a feasibility study for the expansion of port facilities at
Port Moresby. The study recommended that a new location (the one developed
by this project) be selected for container handling. Other consultants (UK)
carried out the necessary operational studies for the project.
2.02      A Bank appraisal mission visited Port Moresby in March 1977 and
recommended development of a new 125 m container wharf and reclaimed back up
area. The latter would be adjacent to the area reclaimed under the First
Ports Project (Cr. 326-PNG), with an extension of the existing container
freight station (CFS). A new coastal wharf at Samarai was also included in
the Second Ports Project as well as provision for the procurement of three
pilot launches.
2.03      Local opposition on environmental grounds, related to the intrusion
of the wharf expansion on waterfront yachting amenities,emerged after the
appraisal and reservations were expressed concerning the proposed container
wharf location. The matter was looked into by a post appraisal mission in
January 1978. Subsequent studies and investigations revealed that the
distance from the port inherent in any other alternative location for
container operations was uneconomic, and the site initially proposed was
eventually approved with the agreement of all concerned.
2.04      The total estimated project cost was K 7.6 million (US$10.5 mil-
lion equivalent) of which K 5.07 million (US$7 million equivalent) would be
in foreign exchange to be jointly supplied by the Bank and KFAED. The Bank
loan of US$3.5 million was approved on April 18, 1978 and signed on May 18,
1978. Effectiveness was delayed until January 10, 1979 due to difficulties
over the legal opinion.
2.05      The loan was closed on January 19, 1982 nearly seven months later
than had been expected and US$464,560 was cancelled.
2.06      Apart from improvements of physical infrastructure, the project
entailed the implementation of numerous measures to improve operational,
organizational and managerial efficiency. Major covenants (Annex 1) covered:
(a)  the requirement to engage only one stevedoring firm for
container operations at Port Moresby;
(b) a study of the cost of services and facilities provided
within each of the country's major ports;
(c) a program of staff training; and
(d) a review of dues and rates.



III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND COST
A.   Project Scope and Content
3.01      The project consisted of:
(a)  additional land reclamation adjacent to that reclaimed under the
First Ports Project (Cr. 326-PNG) to increase area available for
container operations by 1.6 ha to 4.2 ha; a new 125 m berth
serving the reclaimed area with 10 m depth of water alongside; and
and extension of the existing Container Freight Station (CFS) by
3,300 sq m;
(b)  a new 30 m coastal wharf at Samarai with 5 m depth of water
alongside;
(c)  provision of three pilot launches;
(d)  improvements to about 400 m of the access road adjacent to the
port; and
(e)  consulting services for design and construction supervision, tech-
nical assistance, and training.
PINGHB was executing agent for the project assisted by consultants for Port
Moresby and Samarai. The project was expected to be completed by December 31,
1980 and the loan to be closed June 30, 1981.
B.  Implementation
Port Moresby
3.02      In August 1977 consultants completed the design and tender
documents for the container terminal at Port MAoresby.  Tenders were called
for in February 1978 and the lowest evaluated bid was received from an
Australian firm in the sum of K( 4,176,316. The tender was awarded to this
firtn in June 1978 and work commenced in August 1978. It was satisfactorily
completed in June 1980 with no major problems during construction.
Samarai
3.03      Design and tender documents for this work were completed in
October 1978 by the consultants. Te3nders were called for in February 1979
and the lowest evaluated bid was received from a Papua New Guinea firm in



- 4 -
the sum of K 294.728. The tender was awarded May 1979 and the work
satisfactorily completed in September 1980.
Pilot Launches
3.04      The procurement of pilot launches was not satisfactory.  A large
number of tenders was received showing a wide range of prices.   A firm in
Papua New Guinea submitted the lowest evaluated bid (K 72,500 per launich)
and, although the bid was regarded as too low, it did meet the specifica-
tions. The tender was accepted with Bank approval. Many difficulties were
experienced. The launches were plagued by design problems. Incorrect
propellers and excessive weight resulted in the specified speed of 14 knots
not being achieved. The Company finally went into receivership. The cost
of the three launches was K 225,000; but, taking into account rental costs
and other charges resulting from their delayed delivery, their true cost was
K 370,676.
Improvement to the Access Road
3.05       It was originally intended to improve the road from the port to a
nearby traffic roundabout in order to serve the industrial area more
efficiently, but this was cancelled when it was decided not to construct a
connecting road from the roundabout to the city's industrial area. It was
then proposed to improve the road junction immediately in front of the port
entrance in order to reduce congestion, but no work has been undertaken to
date. The Department of Works and Supply (DWS) of the PNG Government was
responsible for design and execution of this work.
Works Supervision
3.06      Relationships among the client, the consultants and the contractor
were good throughout the contract. The work was satisfactorily completed
and the services of the consulting engineers were good. Payments to the
contractors were made promptly.
Consulting Services
3.07      In addition to the works supervision, the project included
consulting services for:
(a)  a services costing study (see below, Section 5.05);
(b)  a training study carried out by consultants (UK), following which
a staff manager trainer was engaged from the consultants for a two
year period terminating May 1982. A staff manager designate is
currently (January 1982) on a six months course and will take up
his duties on return to Port Moresby.

3.09      The costs were close to the appraisal estimate, inflation over the
period of the contract being very low.  Detailed costs of the works at the
Port Moresby container berth are shown at Annex 2.
3.10      The initial allocation of disbursements compared to the revised
actual costs is as follows:

Half the foreign exchange cost was provided by the Bank and half by the
Kuwait Fund. Annual disbursements of the Bank Loan compared to appraisal
estimates were:

3.11      Additional works undertaken under the project, but not financed
by the Bank were:
Extension to Hq. Bldg. Port Moresby              K 495,510
Computer Installation for Hq. Bldg               K 176,228
Standby generator sets (i)  Container Berth   K  40,528
(ii) Hq. Bldg.          K  34,311
The need for standby generators developed after the project had been planned
and was due to the introduction of load shedding by the PNG Electricity
Commission. The Bank would have been willing to consider financing both the
generators and the computer installation, however, difficulties in the pro-
curement procedures adopted and the timing of the works did not permit this.
IV.  TRAFFIC AND OPERATIONS
4.01      The appraisal report estimated a zero growth rate in overseas
traffic for both Port Moresby and for all other ports under PNGHB. Coastal
traffic was forecast at a 5% annual growth for all ports under PNGHB. The
forecast for Port Moresby was 3.5% annual increase for outbound and zero
growth for inbound traffic. Actual traffic statistics for 1978-80 are shown
below in thousands of tons:

Total                   414              418               418
overseas traffic in 1980 for all ports increased 18.9% over 1978 and coastal
declined 7%. Net increase in total traffic was 14.6%. The figures for Port
Moresby show that overseas traffic increased by 14.9% and that coastal
traffic declined 33.6% as a result of increased direct shipment to other
ports from overseas. Total traffic at Port Moresby increased by 0.9X.
Container Traffic
4.02       1980 container traffic compared to 1978 in TEUs (20 ft equivalent
units).

4.03      The appraisal estimate for containers (loaded and unloaded, over-
seas and coastal) at all ports for 1980 was 29,850 against the 45,951
actually handled. For Port Moresby the appraisal estimate was 10,550
against 13,635 actual.



4.04      The container terminal was commissioned in June 1980 and its
effects on the efficiency operations can be seen by examining two
indicators: (i) reduction in ship waiting time and (ii) improvement of ship
turnaround time. With regard to the former, the results have been!
1979    total waiting time overseas ships        39 days
1980      "       """                            18 days
1981    (40 weeks)       t      it"              10 days.
The waiting time for coastal ships has been negligible throughout the
period.
4.05      With regard to improvements in ship turnaround time, the results
using cargo handling productivity data, have been:
Container ships              Overseas break bulk ships
1979           4.50 TEUs hr alongside       tons/net gang hour       15.4
1981 (to Oct) 7.04 TEUs hr alongside        tons/net gang hour       18.6
Improvement   56%                           21%
It should be noted that TEUs/hr figures are for gross hours alongside;
actual figures are 20-25 TEUs per hour of operation.
4.06      The following reductiohs in operating expenses have been achieved:
Average total operating expenses for Sheds 1, 2 and 3 Main Wharf: K 3.09
per ton. Operating expenses for Shed 4 container terminal: K 2.23 per ton.
It should also be noted that the need to transfer containers from the main
wharf to the reclaimed area has been practically eliminated.
4.07      PNGHB have the following commeL±ts on the project design:
(a)  The berth could have been longer, given the depth alongside, nnd
it could have been centralized between the storm bollards.
(b)  While the facility is basically a container terminal, it also
handles overseas break bulk shipments and the open storage area
might have been extended North to facilitate the mixed operations.
(c)  The storage area surfacing Initially laid has not proved to be
satisfactory and the area has been resurfaced. Notwithstanding
the higher capital cost, the "Uniblock" type of concrete block
surfacing would have been a preferable initial choice.



(d) Samarai Wharf. While the wharf itself is adequate and
satisfactory, the sheet piled wall behind the wharf on thie
shoreline might also have been replaced or renovated at the same
time.
These comments are reasonable.
4.08      As agreed with the Bank, a sole operating company was appointed at
Port Moresby under a six-year agreement with the PNGHB to handle cargo opera-
tions. The company also undertakes all stevedoring operations. It employs 32
staff on the container terminal and 42 on the main wharf. Cooperation between
the company and PNGHB staff is very good and is reflected in the results
obtained. PNGHB have appointed a container terminal superintendent.
4.09      PNGHB report that the Samarai wharf is operating satisfactorily,
but that it was only commissioned in September 1980 and the short time
interval since then has not permitted the compilation of reliable operating
statistics.
V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF THE BORROWER
A. Rates and Charges
5.01      Tariffs have been uniform for all ports administered by PNGHB.
Prior to appraisal, the most recent tariff increase took effect on September
30, 1976 and enabled PNGHB to return to profitability after experiencing
an operating deficit in FY7b. Subsequently, during the project period,
PtIGHB made a number of tariff proposals to Government to allow compliance
with the agreed rate of return covenant (Section 4.03 of the Project
Agreement). These proposals were rejected and, consequently, PNGHB's
tariffs remained unchanged until February 1981 when Government approved
tariffs adjustments resulting in overall revenue increases of about 72%.
Details of the February 1981 tariff increases are set forth in Annex 5.1.
The Bank, through an October 1980 supervision mission, played a constructive
role in encouraging the PNGHB/Government dialogue leading to the FY81
revision of tariffs.
B. Earnings and Financial Position
5.02      The profit and loss statements for FY78-80 and estimates for FY81
(forecast at time of appraisal and actual) are set forth in Annex 5.2. Rates
of return for the period are summarized below:



- 10 -
ANNUAL RATE OF RETURN
1979        1980          1981
… ____________    %    …-------------
Covenanted         4.0           7.0         7.0
Actual             1.4          (0.3)        9.3
Strict comparison between forecast and actual profit and loss statements is
made difficult by two factors:  (i) the tariff structure recommended in the
appraisal report with emphasis on a charge per container was not implemented
during the project period and (ii) the forecast depreciation does not
reflect the substantially enhanced asset base resulting from the revaluation
of PNGHB's assets in 1978. Nevertheless, the essential features are clear.
From the inception of the project, earnings deteriorated rapidly and cul-
minated in a small operating deficit in FY80. Thereafter, with implementa-
tion of the recent tariff increases (para. 5.01 above), PNGHB's operating
finances have improved with an estimated rate of return for FY81 above
the 7% return agreed under the loan. Since the traffic exceeded appraisal
expectations (para. 4.1 above) and actual working expenses through FY81 are
close to appraisal estimates,/l the explanation for the earnings and rate of
return profiles resides fully with Government's noncompliance with Section
4.03 of the Loan Agreement requiring appropriate tariff action to enable
PNGHB to maintain agreed rates of return. The lesson to be derived from
this is that the Bank should be more willing to use its leverage prior to
Board approval to obtain tariff adjustments which it anticipates will be
needed during the project period.
5.03      In spite of the earnings deterioration in the early years of the
project, PNGHB has remained financially sound. The strong cash and working
capital position have been more than adequate to finance current operations
Annex 5.3.  The debt to equity ratio has remained consistently modest.
PNGHB's recent balance sheets reflect the successful physical valuation of
the Board's assets in 1978 (Section 4.06 of the Project Agreement).
Re-" valuation of the Board's assets is routinely carried out every year.
This revaluation is included in the accounts for 1979 and 1980 and was
carried out by the use of cost indexes rather than by explicit surveys.
/1 Estimated working expenses for FY81 are within 2% of appraisal forecasts.



- 11 -
C. Costing Study
5.04      PNGHB is not in compliance with Section 3.08 of the Project Agree-
ment requiring completion of a study to determine the cost of services and
facilities provided within each major port operated by PNGHB. Although
PNGHB engaged a consultant to undertake the study, the consultant did not
carry out his task in accordance with thte agreed terms of reference. This
information was known to PNGh-B in the first quarter of 1980 and in the
ensuing 18 months arrangements have not been made to satisfactorily complete
the study. It should be further noted that PNGHB was in violation of a
similar covenant (Section 4.04(c) - Project Agreement) under Credit 326-PNG.
The Asian Development Bank is pursuing the question of a costing study under
the terms of their recent loan to PNGHB to finance the Lae Tidal Basin
Project.
VI. ECONOMIC RE-EVALUATION
6.01      Economic benefits of the project were based on forecast reductions
in ship waiting time, particularly for container ships; reduced congestion in
the ports; increased cargo handling productivity which would be reflected in
lower cargo handling costs and internal transportation costs; and on
miscellaneous benefits. Given the sharp increase in traffic, including a 54%
increase in container traffic (30% at P.T. Moresby), decreased ship waiting
time and reduced port handling costs it is clear that most of the anticipated
benefits were realized.
6.02      It is unfortunate, however, that the working papers which contained
calculations of economic costs and benefits cannot be located. The estimated
14% economic rate of return on the project over the years which was made at
appraisal is quite likely to have been achieved in view of the material
presented in Chapter IV above. A calculation of the first year return slhows a
rate of about 23%.
VII. INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT
6.01      Papua New Guinea Harbours Board (PNGHB) existed prior to the
commencement of the project and the main institutional development aspect of
the project has been the training of nationals to take over the functions of
expatriates responsible for the Board's operations.
6.02      Training undertaken under the loan has been focussed on five main
areas: security, management, finance and administration, pilotage and
engineering. The numbers trained were;



- 12 -
Security:           12, of whom 8 remain with the Board.  Four failed
the course.
Management.         8, two of whom will take over top management posts
(see para. 6.03).
Finance and         7, all trained as accountants except for one trained
Administration:    as staff manager.
Pilotage:           4 trainee pilots attended Singapore Polytechnic, but
all failed.
Engineering:        4 graduate engineers of whom three remain witlh the
Board.
6.03      The proposed new organization for PNGHB is given at Annex 6.1.  The
Managers for Administration and Operations are posts to be filled by nationals
from the train4ng program. The present chairman is holding the post on a
part-time basis. The previous General Manager's contract was terminated in
February 1982. General Manager duties are shared among two nationals filling
the posts of the Administration and Operations Ilanagers respectively. The
Board has decided that the present administrative structure will remain in
effect until at least the end of 1982. The Financial Advisor has been invited
to remain with the Board until December 1982 and the Secretary's post was
taken over by a national at end of 1981, with the current Secretary remaining
as advisor until July 1982.  Thus, the only rema'ning expatriates are the
Chief Engineer, two Assistant Chief Engineers, Superintendent of Pilotage and
five pilots, and the Regional Port Managers at Rabaul and Port Moresby.
Additional expatriate staff include an operations inspector, an internal
auditor, a computer controller, a senior works officer and a regional works
officer.
6.04      The leases of PNGHB's properties and port areas have now been
finalized except as noted in Annex 6.2. It is expected that time will elapse
before all lease-associated problems are satisfactorily resolved. This is
due to imperfections of land registration procedures in Papua New Guinea.
VIII. THE ROLE OF THE BANK
7.01      The Bank's involvement in this project was motivated by the need to
improve the infrastructural requirements for handling container traffic and
the training requirements to enable nationals to take over management roles.
7.02      Project supervision was generally appropriate in its intensity and
scope, although the presence of a financial analyst with the earlier missions
would have been helpful in resolving tariff problems more expeditiously. The



- 13 -
Bank played a significant role in assisting to resolve the question of the
port site location and consistently pointed out to Government the problems
PNGHB would experience in future years if appropriate tariff increases were
not forthcoming.
IX. CONCLUSION
8.01      The project achieved its objectives which were to reduce the costs
of imports and exports through greater ef7iciency and reduced cargo handling
costs.  The estimated first year economic return of 23% is satisfactorily
higher than the estimated project return of 14%. It did not, however, produce
the basic data on the country's port costs necessary for the Government to
better assess maritime investments and their social and economic impact
because of shortcomings of a consultant. It is to be regretted that
arrangements have not yet been made for the proper completion of this work.
8.02      The project has been successful in improving operations at Port
Moresby. It was completed on time and within the budget including physical
contingencies. The coastal wharf at Samarai was also completed to schedule.
The provision of the pilot launches was unsatisfactory and while the bid
accepted might have been rejected on the grounds of lack of experience of the
firm concerned, this would have been difficult for political reasons. Pre-
qualification of builders would have lessened the risks. PNGHB have suggested
that arrangements for the routine provision of such equipment through a
competent external agency might have been preferable. For reasons beyond the
Bank's and PNGHB control, the mlnor road improvements included in the project
description have not been carried out.
