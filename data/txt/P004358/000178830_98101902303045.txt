Description:     The proposed project would provide container handling
facilities at Port Moresby, with the objective of avoid-
ing ship waiting time, reducing ship turnaround time and
significanitly reducing cargo handling costs, thereby
enabling ]?ort Moresby to realize fully the greater effic-
iency of container shipping. Major components include
land reclamation of 1.6 ha, a 125 m berth, an extension
of the present container freight station, and improvements
to the port access road. Also included in the project
are a 30 in coastal berth at Samarai, located on a small
island off the coast of Southern Papua, and consulting
services fEor project design and implementation, and for
training ]?apua New Guinea Harbours Board staff. There
are no special risks associated with the project. A
25% increase in capital costs would reduce the rate of
return from 14% to 10%.

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAkL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO PAPUA NEW GUINEA
FOR A SECOND PORT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to Papua New Guinea for the equivalent of US$3.5 million to help finance
a second port project. The loan would have a term of 20 years, including
5 years grace with interest at 7.50% per annum. The Kuwait Fund would
provide US$3.5 million equivalent in joint financing. Both loans would be
onlent to the Papua New Guinea Harbours Board at 7.50% interest for 20 years
with four years grace.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An economic mission visited Papua New Guinea (PNG) in early 1976,
and its report, "Papua New Guinea: Economic Situation and Development
Prospects," (Report No. 1150-PNG) was distributed to the Executive Directors
in July 1976. A smaller mission in late 1976 led to a Country Economic
Memorandum (Report No. 1428-PNG) which was distributed to the Executive
Directors in October 1977. The following discussion of the economy of PNG is
based on these two reports. Details of recent economic data can be found in
Annex I.
3.        Papua New Guinea achieved internal self-government on December 1,
1973, and independence from Australia on September 16, 1975. It is a land of
mountainous terrain, endowed with good soils, abundant rainfall, considerable
mineral resources, and forestry and fishery resources of good commercial
potential. The capital city, Port Moresby, is the largest urban settlement
in what remains an overwhelmingly rural society. Only seven towns have more
than 10,000 inhabitants. Of the arable land, 90% is still under subsistence
agriculture, and 60% to 70% of the population are subsistence farmers, many of
whom have only recently emerged from a neolithic culture.
4.        The most striking feature of the economy is the contrast between
the relatively suall modern monetary sector and the subsistence sector.
Papua New Guinea is a clear example of a dual economy. This dualism is well
recognized by the Government, and the economic policies which have been
developed since independence are directed towards reducing the contrasts
between the modern and the subsistence sectors and directing development
efforts towards the latter. The modern sector consists of a large copper
mine, contributing about 207. to 25% of the GDP, the government sector, and
a variety of small manufacturing, wholesale and retail trade, tourism,
banking and insurance, contributing another 50% of the GDP. Agriculture,
forestry and fisheries provide the remaining 25% - 30% of the GDP mainly
within a subsistence form of production. Within this structure, the relatively
abundant subsistence agriculture is slowly being converted into a subsistence-
plus-cash-crop agriculture; cash-crop farming is predominantly export oriented,
and the 500 to 600 plantations are completely export oriented. The main
agricultural exports are coffee, cocoa, and copra.



- 2 -
5.        The modern sector of the economy is dominated by the Bougainville
copper mine which came into production in 1972. However, the dualistic
nature of the economy existed before the mine was constructed because
of the role of the Government, staffed, before independence, entirely by
expatriates and serviced by an expatriate commercial sector oriented to
their needs and those of the owners and managers of expatriate-owned plan-
tations. The level of public services provided could not be financed by
local revenues and was supported by subventions from Australia. The modern
sector was heavily dependent upon imports which were also financed by the
support from Australia. This situation continued after independence, with
the Australian grant now formalized under an agreement which covers a five-
year period.
6.        Real GDP in Papua New Guinea grew at at an average of more than 8%
per annum during the period 1967/68 to 1973/74. This growth was led by the
monetary sector, growing at over 10% per annum, while the subsistence sector
grew at less than 1% per annum. As a result, the share in GDP of the subsis-
tence sector fell from about two thirds to its present one third. Real GDP
fell in both 1974/75 and 1975/76, but improvements in the world economy,
particularly rising prices for PNG's major exports, contributed to a more
favorable economic performance in 1976/77. The growth rate of the indigenous
population is at present about 2.8% per annum, an increase over the 2.5% per
annum rate of ten years ago, due mainly to a halving of the infant/child
mortality rate. Per capita GNP in 1976 was US$490, but this average includes
the high-income expatriate sector. The per capita GNP of the local population
in the subsistence sector is probably no more than US$200 per capita.
7.        The dependence of the economy upon the outside world is reflected
in a structural balance of payments deficit. The need to import most of
the capital and consumer goods required, including food, has meant that there
is normally a current account deficit. Exports consisted, until 1972, of
a few agricultural commodities whose total value covered about half the
total import bill. The other half was covered by the Australian budget
grant. After the Bougainville copper mine came into production in April
1972, the 1972/73 level of agricultural exports of about US$90 million was
suddenly dwarfed by copper exports of more than US$200 million, and PNG's
traditionally negative trade balance became positive. However, in 1974,
copper prices fell sharply, and copper's contribution to the country's
exports dropped from 70% to about 50%.
8.        The Bougainville copper mine has played an important role in the
country's economy through its impact upon exports and the public finances.
As an enclave operation its contribution to employment has been small.
Mining's share in GDP rose from 2% in 1968/69 to 32% in 1973/74. The impact
of Bougainville on national investment was also large; during the construction
phase, it accounted for nearly 60% of all fixed capital formation in the
country. As indicated above, the impact on exports has been enormous; between
1972 and 1975, the copper mine doubled PNG's export earnings. Furthermore,
the growth of exports from the mine has accounted for the bulk of incremental
GDP in the last few years. Papua New Guinea receives a fair share of the



earnings from the Bougainville mine as a result of the renegotiation of Lhe
agreement with the operating company in 1974. Furthermore, the impact of
fluctuating copper earnings on the Government's budget has been stabilized
through the operation of the Mineral Resources Stabilization Flnd established
in 1974. Payments into the fund include the revenues from company income and
excess profits taxes, government dividends, and the proceeds of the withhold-
ing tax on dividends paid overseas. These funds are then transferred in
predetermined amounts into ithe budget, where they are used according to
Government priorities. Another large copper mine is expected to be con-
structed within the next few years, and its operation will be governed by an
agreement similar to that reached in Bougainville.
9.        Government activities are the second most important influence in
the economy. Real expenditures by the Government increased at a rate of
close to 5% per annum during the past five years. This rise was mainly the
result of a substantial increase in current outlays, dominated by wages and
salaries (45-50% of total current expenditures), and the purchase of goods
and services (35-40%). Government employment of staff grew at close to 6%
per annum from 1971 to 1975 and, simultaneously, there were substantial
increases in wage and salary levels, influenced by strong trade union tradi-
tions which had been introduced before independence. However, internal reve-
nues have grown at a faster rate than have expenditures, but not sufficiently
to eliminate the current account deficit, which is met by grants from Australia.
10.       PNG benefits greatly from Australian assistance, both financial and
technical, although the relative importance of such assistance is declining.
Australian grants provided 42% of the 1976/77 budget, down from the 70%
provided in 1963. The commencement of copper production in 1972 contributed
to the decreased dependence on Australia by expanding domestic revenues by
about one third. Under the terms of a recent agreement, Australia's aid
program for PNG for the period 1976-81 will amount to approximately A$1 bil-
lion (US$1.1 billion). Subsequent to the agreement, a series of revaluations
of the kina relative to the Australian dollar have reduced the kina value of
Australian aid, but this loss should be partially compensated by lower prices
on goods imported from Australia, PNG's major trading partner.
11.       Papua New Guinea"s dependence on outsiders for its technical
expertise is gradually decLining. Expatriates, largely Australians, accounted
for 11% of the Government staff as of April 1977, compared to 20% in 1971.
In the private sector, many senior administrative, professional, and higher
technical posts are also now filled by expatriates. The Government attaches
great importance to restraining both employment and salary increases, and has
recently taken steps to ensure such restraint. It has also placed a high
priority on technical education to train Papua New Guineans to replace the
higher paid expatriates.
12.       A recent government policy statement calls for the concentration of
a higher proportion of the nation's resources in rural areas. The Government
proposes to improve the coordination of extension services, diversify and
raise agricultural production, introduce appropriate technology, promote



- 4 -
small-scale industry, develop means to mobilize local savings, redistribute
health services towards rural areas, introduce and improve marketing and
storage facilities, and extend rural electrification. In addition, recog-
nizing that in many areas the high cost and slow speed of transport are major
obstacles to rural improvement, the Government will accord high priority to
improving and extending the existing transport system in order to increase
accessibility to markets, both through development of feeder road systems and
improvement of coastal shipping. A few large-scale natural resource based
projects, such as the expected new copper mine and a possible power scheme,
will be encouraged as the main sources of revenue to reduce reliance on
foreign aid. These policies reflect a substantial shift of emphasis in
comparison with the First Five-Year Development Plan (1969-73), which concen-
trated on the build-up of infrastructure and the development of the modern
sector of the economy.
13.       Papua New Guinea faces special problems of nationhood arising from
its geographical situation, an archipelago of islands without developed
transport links. Its people also come from diverse cultural and ethnic
backgrounds. In order to respond to these characteristics and to tap local
initiatives, Papua New Guinea is introducing a system of provincial govern-
ments. The aim is to devise a workable system which does not give rise
to a costly government structure, but which gives the responsibility for imple-
menting development projects to local people. These developments should
reinforce the central government policies to give priority to development
outside the modern sector.
14.       Total external public debt outstanding as of December 31, 1976,
amounted to US$336 million, of which US$96.6 million was owed to the Bank
Group. Public debt service payments in 1975/76 were about 5.8% of the gross
value of exports of goods and nonfactor services. Debt payments to the Bank
Group were only about 16% of total debt service payments. Debt service is
expected to fall to about 4% of exports by the early 1980s. About one-fifth
of total debt service obligations would be due to the Bank Group. In addition,
there are considerable interest and dividend payments abroad, mainly as a
result of the Bougainville copper project. PNG is considered creditworthy
for a limited amount of Bank lending. In addition to Australia, other
bilateral sources (e.g. Japan and New Zealand) are also expected to make aid
funds available. The Asian Development Bank has lent to PNG from its Special
Fund and is expected to continue lending to PNG in the future, and several
commercial loans have recently been arranged.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
15.       Bank Group assistance to Papua New Guinea has consisted of six
loans (US$67.5 million) and seven development credits (US$48.2 million), which
together have helped to finance twelve projects. This assistance has focused
largely on infrastructure development - 80% of total Bank Group assistance
has been for power, telecommunications, highways, and ports. Agricultural
projects - mainly oil palm and livestock - and one education project have
absorbed the remaining 20% of Bank Group assistance. IFC is considering
investment in a tuna fishing/canning project; this would be IFC's first
operation in PNG.



- 5 -
16.       Project implementation has been satisfactory although, in some
cases, it was slowed down -by transition to self-government and independence.
Disbursements have sometimes been slow because of administrative procedures
requiring multiple clearances for preparing withdrawal applications. Annex II
contains a summary statement of Bank loans and IDA credits as of February 28,
1978, and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
17.       In view of PNG's very scant infrastructure base, the past emphasis
of Bank Group assistance was appropriate in helping to open up remote areas
and establish a basic foundation for future economic development. However,
in the coming years, a somewhat different strategy appears more appropriate
with greater emphasis on agriculture and rural development projects, which
would have a direct impact on the subsistence sector. About two thirds of
PNG's population rely on subsistence production for the bulk of its livelihood,
and living conditions for these people are among the most primitive found any-
where in the world. For these people, the most appropriate form of assistance
would be an integrated package of components, aimed at increasing and diversi-
fying agricultural production and incomes through improved indigenous cash
and food cropping methods, and at raising rural living standards through the
provision of social and economic infrastructure. However, because of the
primitive condition of these areas and the Government's very limited prepara-
tion capability, designing such projects requires considerable lead-in time.
Consequently, the number of such projects which the Bank can realistically
expect to assist in the coming years and the level of such lending the Bank
can hope to achieve will be constrained.
18.       Infrastructure development still has a vital role to play in
PNG's economic development and it is proposed that the Bank Group continue
assisting such projects, but on an increasingly selective basis. The
further development of the transport sector will be of critical importance
in realizing the potential of many presently backward areas. However,
reflecting a constraint prevalent throughout the public service, manpower,
capable of planning sectoral investment strategy and of identifying and
preparing projects, is extremely scarce. A transport sector mission is
scheduled for mid-1978 which will review the Government's investment
strategy, focusing particularly on the needs of primitive rural areas, and
an appropriate balance and coordination between various transport modes.
Based on the findings of the transport sector mission, Bank staff would
expect to identify further transport projects such as rural access roads
and coastal shipping, which could directly assist PNG's subsistence popu-
lation. Finally, Bank staff are working with the Government to determine
rural water supply and electrification requirements, and would expect that
these should materialize in FY80 and FY81 projects.
19.       While the manpower constraint which confronts PNG has been
relieved to some extent by aggressive recruitment of expatriates, skilled
technical and administrative personnel remain very scarce relative to the
need. The Government's ability to identify and prepare projects is ex-
tremely weak. With the Government's concurrence, Bank staff have made very
preliminary overtures to LINDP for assistance in setting up a project



- 6 -
preparation facility which could help to ameliorate the situation. However,
even if this proposal is ultimately accepted, it would be some time before
its benefits would begin to be realized. In the meantime, the Bank's
technical advice and support in project preparation and implementation will
be especially important. Moreover, a particular effort will be made to
identify and include technical assistance components as appropriate in
forthcoming projects.
20.       A major developmental decision confronting Papua New Guinea is how
to balance the allocation of national resources between revenue generating
projects, geared toward exploitation of its very considerable mineral wealth,
and projects which aim directly at increased incomes and improved welfare for
the subsistence population. On occasion, PNG has, in the past, sought the
Bank's advice on such strategy questions. Moreover, in response to the
Government's request, the Bank has offered advice to the Government on
particular resource-based projects (such as a possible scheme to harness the
hydropower potential of the Purai River in Central Papua) in their early
stages of conceptualization.
PART III - THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
Background
21.       For many years, the geography of Papua New Guinea confined economic
activity to a few urban centers: Port Moresby in Papua; Lae and Madang in
New Guinea; and Rabaul in New Britain. Initially, these centers were supplied
by sea and, later, by air. For decades, they remained economic enclaves, as
the country's rugged topography inhibited economic development of the interior.
In recent years and particularly since independence, the interest in pro-
viding access to the interior regions in order to realize the country's
considerable economic potential has focused attention on the transport
sector. The large number of islands and the abundance of good natural
harbors make sea transport important both for inter-island, and overseas
communication and shipping. Interior land transportation is not well-
developed - the coastal plain is either narrow, terminating abruptly in
formidable mountain ranges; or low-lying, swampy, and intersected by major
rivers. Consequently, for interior travel, airplanes have frequently been
the most important and, sometimes, the only form of transport.
Civil Aviation
22.       Air, the major mode of long distance domestic passenger travel,
increased by about 10% each year between 1964 and 1974. In addition, some
freight is still moved by air, particularly to and from the more isolated
areas, but this has declined substantially in recent years, with the
expansion of the road network. Scheduled internal services are mainly
provided by Air Niugini (84% Government-owned), which has a low aircraft
utilization rate due to the restriction of most flights to daylight hours.
Four other companies operate scheduled and charter services, and a further



- 7 -
12 operators are licensed for charter operations only. PNG is adequately
served by international flights from Australia, Hong Kong, the Philippines,
and Japan. Port Moresby has the only international airport. However, a
new airport was opened in 1977 near Lae, constructed with Aus'ralian
assistance, which may become a second international airport.
Ports and Shipping
23.       Most of PNG's overseas trade is handled by nine main ports:  Port
Moresby, Lae, Madang, and hWewak on the mainland; and Rabaul, Samarai,
Kavieng, Kieta, and Kimbe on other islands. In addition, Oro Bay, on the
mainland, handles a significant volume of coastal traffic. These ten ports,
together with six smaller piorts, are administered by the Papua New Guinea
Harbours Board (PNGHB) and handled a total of 1.3 million tons in 1975-76.
Development of the ports of Port Moresby, Lae, Kieta, and Alotau (one of the
six smaller ports), has been under way since 1972, partly financed by Credit
326-PNG. Most of this was completed in 1976. Additional works at Kieta and
Port Moresby were completed in July 1977, and a barge ramp at Alotau is still
under construction.
24.       Overseas shipping; services are provided by ten foreign shipping
lines. Coastal and inter-island services are provided by about 240 Govern-
ment-licensed and locally-owned small vessels greater than 10 m in length.
The Government is studying, with Norwegian assistance, the feasibility of
regularly scheduled services between the main ports, and is contemplating a
substantial investment, through the newly established PNG Shipping Corpora-
tion, in specially designed coastal ships for main port services. At present,
a Government-owned fleet of 87 small vessels provides passenger services to
remote communities and carries a small amount of cargo. A five-year program
for replacement of old vessels in this fleet is expected to commence in FY78.
The Bank is discussing with the Government a possible project for improving
coastal shipping operations.
25.       The volume of containers through PNG ports has been growing rapidly
and all shipments from Australia, which account for about 50% of overseas
traffic, have now been containerized. Most of the containers will be handled
through Lae, which has adequate facilities (provided under Credit 326), or
through Port Moresby, whose present inadequate facilities are preventing the
full realization of increased efficiencies of container shipping. In
addition, ocean freight rates to and from Port Moresby will ultimately rise
without better container facilities in the port.
26.       The main port facilities in Port Moresby are located in a well-
protected deep-water bay, adjacent to the city center. The existing wharf's
design load is too low for efficient handling of containers and the facility's
present heavy maintenance requirements will increase even further as container
traffic increases. Coasta:L shipping is presently handled at a berth located
about 250 m east of the main wharf which is in a seriously dilapidated
state. Upon completion of the proposed project, coastal shipping would be
diverted to the present main wharf, and overseas cargo would be largely
handled at the newly constructed facilities.

The Papua New Guinea Harbours Board (PNGHB)
27.       PNGHB, established in 1963, is a corporate entity with comprehen-
sive supervisory functions including control, regulation, and management of
16 ports. The Bank's experience with PNGHB under the First Port Project
has been generally satisfactory. There has been a considerable improvement
in PNGHB's system of accounting over the past two years. However, under
the First Port Project, it was agreed that individual port services would
be costed to enable dues and rates to be cost-based. This has not yet been
accomplished. As a necessary first step towards compliance with this
requirement, PNGHB has agreed to undertake a study to determine the cost of
individual services at each major port and to review these costs annually
in relation to the revenues derived from each of the services. PNGHB has
also agreed to employ consulting engineers to revalue its assets no later
than December 31, 1978, and every three years thereafter (see draft Project
Agreement, Sections 3.08 and 4.06).
28.       In line with Government policy, PNGHB is endeavoring to increase
the number of its indigenous officers, and some of the more senior positions
will, for the first time, be filled by indigenous staff within the next few
years. Since the experience of these new staff will inevitably be limited,
funds are included in the project for the training of indigenous staff in the
fields of engineering and accounting, and for consultants' services. While
newly recruited staff are gaining experience, it may be necessary to maintain
an appropriate expatriate presence at senior management levels. The positions
of chief financial officer and chief engineer are especially important, and
the Bank would review the qualifications and experience of any candidates
proposed to succeed the present incumbents (see draft Project Agreement,
Sections 3.02 and 3.06).
29.       PNGHB does not yet hold all necessary leases for the present port
area or for improvements at other ports, as required under the First Port
Project. The absence of land records and the high staff turnover in the
responsible department are the chief causes of delay. While the absence of
the necessary leases has not delayed construction of the First Project, it,
quite obviously, is a situation which must be corrected. Recently enacted
legislation should facilitate the granting of the necessary leases to PNGHB
covering the area of the proposed project by January 1, 1979 (draft Loan
Agreement, Section 3.02(a)). In order to ensure the continued efficient use
of port facilities, the next stage of port development, planned to begin in
about 1987, should be contiguous to the present facilities. After consider-
able investigation, the Government and the Bank agree that the expansion
should be located to the north of the proposed project (see draft Loan
Agreement, Section 4.02(ii)).
30.       Cargo handling at Port Moresby is now performed by four private
stevedoring companies, licensed by PNGHB, and selected by the shipping
companies. While this arrangement is satisfactory for general cargo handled
at the existing facilities, in order to ensure that containers can be located
and retrieved in a timely and efficient manner, it will be necessary to estab-
lish a single stevedoring organization to be responsible for all container

operations. PNGHB has agreed to make appropriate arrangements for one
stevedoring firm or consortium to be responsible for container handling at
Port Moresby by January 1, 1979, and to appoint a PNGHB officer to supervise
the container terminal operations (see draft Loan Agreement, Section 4.02(i)
and draft Project Agreement, Section 3.04 (ii)).
31.       PNGHB's capital investment program for 1978 through 1982 totals
US$18.4 million, including the proposed project. Besides expenditures to
complete the First Port Project and the proposed Second Project, the program
includes: coastal shipping facilities at Rabaul; a cargo shed at Kavieng; a
new wharf at Madang; construction of breasting dolphins, an extension of the
coastal facilities and the first stage of a tidal basin at Lae; and minor
works at other ports. Based on conservative traffic forecasts, PNGHB would
be able to finance about half of its capital investment program, in addition
to its current operations, from internal cash resources.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Description
32.       The project would provide, at Port Moresby, adequate and efficient
facilities for handling containers, including an extension of the available
land area and the existing container freight station and facilities for
refrigerated container cargoes. It would provide an adequate capacity to
handle the forecast traffiLc until the next port development is required in
about 1987. In addition, the proposed project would provide a new coastal
facility at Samarai, located on a small island off the coast of Southern
Papua, to replace the existing wharf which is in an extremely dilapidated
and unsafe condition. The project, which was prepared by PNGHB with the
help of consultants, was appraised in February 1977.  At that time, it
included a substantial road component which, after a lengthy deliberation,
the Government eventually wished to delete from the project. In addition,
the Government wished to have additional time to review the location of the
next stage of port development. Since, by the time these decisions were
taken, considerable time had elapsed, a follow-up appraisal was required in
January 1978. Negotiations took place in Washington in March 1978, with
Ms. Patricia Curley leading the PNG delegation. Representatives of the Kuwait
Fund, which would provide joint financing for the project, attended negotia-
tions as observers. A Supplementary Project Data Sheet is included as
Annex III. The project would consist of the following components:
(a) additional reclaimed land of about 1.6 ha adjacent to the 2.6 ha
provided under the First Port Project;
(b) a new 125 m berth to handle containers;
(c) an extension to the existing container freight station;
(d) improvements to about 400 m of the road adjacent to the port;



- 10 -
(e) a 30 m long coastal berth at Samarai;
(f) pilotage launches for other ports; and
(g) consulting services for design and construction supervision, and
technical assistance and training.
The road improvements to be done under the project would be sufficient to
meet the port's immediate access requirements. However, improvements to
the road between the industrial area and the port (about 15 km), which had
originally been included in the proposed project, will soon be required.
The Government concurs with this assessment and has undertaken to complete
the appropriate improvements by January 1982 (see draft Loan Agreement,
Section 3.03).
Project Cost and Financing
33.       The total cost of the proposed project is estimated at US$10.5
million, with a foreign exchange component of US$7.0 million. The estimate
is based upon final design and unit costs for similar ongoing or recently
completed works in PNG and is considered adequate. It includes 10% for
physical contingencies, and an allowance for price increases of 9% in 1978-79
and 8% in 1980. The proposed Bank loan of US$3.5 million would cover 50% of
the estimated foreign exchange costs of US$7.0 million; joint-financing of
the balance would be provided by the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development
(the Kuwait Fund). The full amount of US$7.0 million would be relent to
PNGHB at 7.50% interest for 20 years including four years grace, with PNGHB
assuming the foreign exchange risk. At the request of the Kuwait Fund,
the Bank has incorporated a cross-default and cross-effectiveness clause into
its Loan Agreement (see draft Loan Agreement, Sections 5.01 (f) and 6.01
(a)). Local currency costs would be financed by PNGHB.
PNGHB's Financial Position
34.       PNGHB's revenues in recent years have not kept pace with operating
costs. The traffic volume and, consequently, the financial performance in
1975-1977, were substantially below that forecasted when the First Port
Project was appraised, with the result that the 8% return on net fixed assets
required under the First Project was not realized. The principal reason
for this poor performance is the failure to increase tariffs sufficiently to
compensate for static traffic and the unexpected increase in operating
expenses (mainly a trebling of depreciation and a doubling of working
expenses). An operating deficit was incurred in 1976. Later that year, a
long overdue increase in tariffs and rates was instituted. However,
further increases are required if PNGHB is to meet its obligations and
preserve a sound financial position, particularly during the construction
period of the project. The appraisal mission has estimated what would be
adequate tariffs to ensure a reasonable return on fixed assets and a
healthy cash position. These rates are as follows: for container traffic,
US$134 per container, replacing the present berthage and wharfage charges



- 11 -
on containerized cargo; for non-container overseas traffic, a 70% increase
in berthage and a 30% increase in wharfage rates; and for coastal traffic,
a 10% increase each in wharfage and berthage rates. In addition, a steve-
doring charge should be imposed at Port Moresby.
35.       Based on the projected traffic (which in the case of containers
assumes zero growth), these cr similar tariffs would result in a 4% rate of
return in 1979 and a 7% return thereafter which would be adequate. To
continue to require an 8% return would necessitate tariff increases so large
as to be unacceptable to both the Government and the shipping industry.
Therefore, we have agreed to modify the rate of return requirement under the
First Ports Project; the Government and PNGHB have agreed to adjust tariffs
by January 1, 1979 and, subsequently as necessary, to ensure that the revised
rates of return (4% in 1979, and 7% thereafter) are met (see draft Loan
Agreement, Section 4.03 and diraft Project Agreement, Section 4.03). The
projections of PNGHB's cash J-low was done in the context of its currently
planned investment program which was reviewed during negotiations. A signi-
ficant increase in investmentL over this plan could render PNGHB's cash
position inadequate. Therefore, it was agreed that PNGHB would seek the
Bank's concurrence before undertaking any investments (except the proposed
project) which would require annual expenditures exceeding US$830,000 in 1978
and 1979 and US$1.4 million in 1980-82 (see draft Loan Agreement Section 4.04
and draft Project Agreement, Section 4.04). (These levels reflect PNGHB's
planned program of investment plus some margin of flexibility).
Procurement and Disbursement
36.       Contracts for construction and supply for all items in the proposed
project would be awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding,
in accordance with Bank guidelines, which is acceptable to the Kuwait Fund.
The contract for pilotage launches has already been let to a local firm
following international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank guidelines,
and retroactive financing of US$100,000 for this component is recommended.
Because of the urgency to provide the container facilities, PNGHB proposes
to prepare all documentation and to call for tenders in accordance with
Bank guidelines prior to loan signature. However, the tender would be
let only after loan signature.
37.       Disbursement for civil works would be at the rate of 32% of the
total cost. For technical assistance, training, and consulting services,
disbursement would be on the basis of 50% of total costs. Disbursement for
the pilotage launches would be at 45% of total costs. Joint financing to be
provided under the Kuwait Ftnd loan would be disbursed in equivalent percent-
ages for the respective categories.
Implementation
38.       Construction:  PNGHB, with the assistance of consultants, would be
responsible for the execution of the project. It is expected that construc-
tion would commence in June 1978 and would be completed in June 1980.



- 12 -
39.       Engineering Services and Technical Assistance:  Final engineering
has been completed by the firm of Maunsell and Partners (Australia), who has
also been appointed for construction supervision and is acceptable to the
Bank.
40.       While PNGHB has a vigorous training program for new recruits and
existing staff, aimed at localizing technical and managerial staff, sub-
stantial losses of trained local staff to other organizations have occurred
over the past few years due to the general shortage of trained PNG staff.
The proposed project would provide consultancy services to review the existing
program and establish additional training requirements, and would provide
on-the-job training for new recruits in the fields of management, accounting,
and data collection, together with financing of overseas training. This
technical assistance would also include the costing study referred to above
(para. 27), and would set up a data collection system to provide a commodity
breakdown of traffic statistics, with the objective of improving port planning
capabilities. A total of 36 man-months of consultancy services has been
included at an average cost of $6,000 per man-month, excluding air travel and
local subsistence costs, plus $24,000 for overseas training.
Ecology and Impact
41.       The proposed reclamation of land for the port works at Port Moresby
is similar in all respects to that undertaken for Credit 326-PNG, which had
no adverse effects on the harbor ecology. The proposed dredging would not
be excessive and the spoil would be dumped beyond the existing coral reef.
No other environmental effects are expected from the proposed project.
Benefits and Justification
42.       Port Moresby handles almost all external trade for the southern
mainland together with a substantial volume of coastal traffic. About half
of Port Moresby's external trade is with Australia. The proposed project has
two objectives: (i) to provide Port Moresby with facilities to cope with the
container traffic, brought about by Australian shippers' decision to contain-
erize all its PNG shipments; and (ii) to permit coastal shipping to use the
existing main wharf instead of the present coastal facility, which is in a
seriously dilapidated condition.
43.       A major benefit of the proposed project would be to avoid ship
waiting time and to reduce ship turnaround time for both coastal and overseas
ships; this saving has been valued at some US$1.1 million annually. Port
tariffs would be increased to ensure that those benefits which would otherwise
accrue to foreign shipping firms (about US$480,000 annually) would be retained
in PNG.   Another benefit of the proposed project would be to avoid the present
transport of containers between the existing wharf and the existing shed.
Expanded shed space and reduced congestion at the new berth would reduce cargo
handling costs by some US$474,000 annually. To ensure the full realization
of the benefits to coastal shipping, the existing coastal wharf should be
closed to all cargo ships more than 10 m long. The wharf itself need not be



- 13 -
demolished as it is still useful for small Government passenger launches (see
draft Project Agreement, Section 3.03). Taken together, these benefits would
yield an economic rate of return of 14%.
44.       There are no special risks associated with the project.  A 25%
increase in capital costs would reduce the rate of return to 10%. No increase
in the volume of container traffic has been assumed in the calculation of
project benefits, and reduction in the projections of other traffic to a zero
growth rate would have a negligible impact on the project's rate of return.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
45.       The draft Loan Agreement between Papua New Guinea and the Bank; the
draft Project Agreement between the Papua New Guinea Harbours Board and the
Bank; and the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii),
of the Articles of Agreement are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately.
46.       Features of special interest in the draft Loan and Project agree-
ments are referred to in Annex III, Section III, of this Report.
47.       There are three additional conditions of effectiveness:  that the
Kuwait Fund Loan Agreement, the Project Agreement and the subsidiary Loan
Agreement have been executed on behalf of the relevant parties thereto.
48.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
49.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

B. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION /2
Credit No. 326   First Ports Project; US$9.2 Million Credit of July 21,
1972; Effective Date: February 8, 1973; Closing Date:
April 30, 1978
The original project consisted of extending port facilities at Lae
and Kieta, land reclamation for new storage facilities at Port Moresby, a
/1  Prior to exchange rate adjustments.
/2  These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution and, in particular, to report
any problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken
to remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the
understanding that they do not purport to present a balanced
evaluation of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

new port development at Alotau, provisions of mechanical handling equipment,
and consultant services. Work on all the original port improvements included
in the project has been completed; the contract for improvements to the Ocean
Wharf at Kieta, subsequently included in the project, has been let. There
will not be any expenditures for mechanical equipment as originally foreseen.
Papua New Guinea Harbours Board's revenues have not kept pace with increasing
operating costs and, in 1976, an operating deficit occurred.  Further tariff
increases are required to preserve PNGHB's sound financial position; the
appraisal mission for the Second Ports Project estimated that tariff
increases would permit PNGHB to earn an acceptable return on net fixed
assets.   Total cost of the civil engineering projects is practically
the same as previously reported. In order to fully utilize the credit, it
was agreed to expand the area of reclaimed land in the port area in prepar-
ation for the proposed second project. The closing date was extended
from September 30, 1977, to April 30, 1978.
Credit No. 348   Smallholder Livestock Credit Project; US$5.0 Million
Credit of January 4, 1973; Effective Date: May 11, 1973;
Closing Date: June 30, 1978
The project supports the Government's program for development of
livestock production by smallholders. Subloans are made through the Papua
New Guinea Development Bank (PNGDB) to smallholders for beef, pig, and
poultry production. Technical assistance to smallholder livestock producers
is provided by the Department of Primary Industry (DPI). The project also
provides for farmer training, in-service training of DPI extension staff, and
for upgrading livestock research. Physical progress of the project has been
good in that the total number of subloans has been in excess of the appraisal
estimate. However, the total number of subloans has been much smaller than
anticipated at appraisal and only about 58% of the credit was disbursed at
June 30, 1977. The closing date was extended to June 30, 1978. Despite
major changes within PNG following independence, the project has proceeded
quite well. The major recommendation of the last supervision mission is that
DPI and PNGDB establish a system to monitor and evaluate the projects in
order to improve overall project management.
Loan No. 999   Second Power Project; US$10.8 Million Loan of
June 12, 1974; Effective Date: December 27, 1974;
Closing Date: December 31, 1979
This project consists of three distinct items:
(i) training of local staff to permit an early and
rapid reduction of expatriates;
(ii) modest distribution expansion covering needs
through 1979; and
(iii)  a shortfall in foreign exchange for Loan 737-PNG
because of the devaluation of the US dollar.
Procurement of distribution materials is under way. As for staff
recruitment, ELCOM did experience some difficulty at the time of independence



ANNEX II
Page 3
in reaching the target figure due to movement of overseas staff back to
Australia and suitable replacements. Expatriates originally selected as
trainers have not always been suitable. To overcome these problems partially,
ELCOM employed management consultants to conduct training courses or to
provide guidance. The results have been very encouraging and the project now
seems to be proceeding satisfactorily. Local staff have been gradually
taking over daily operations.
Loan No. 1333   Popondetta Smallholder Oil Palm Development Project;
US$12.0 Million Loan of November 19, 1976; Effective
Date: January 6, 1977; Closing Date: December 31, 1984
The project is designed to establish 9,600 ha of oil palm plantings
and processing facilities around Popondetta. The 4,000 ha nucleus estate and
factory, which are to serve both estate and smallholder production, are being
developed as a joint venture between the Government and the Commonwealth
Development Corporation. The Bank-financed portion of the project includes:
5,600 ha of oil palm plantings, subdivided into 1,400 smallholder plots;
long-term credit facilities for smallholders to be provided through the
PNGDB; extension and visiting inspection services; and technical assistance
for project management, social infrastructure, and improvement of the road
network. The nucleus estate company started oil palm plantings in Feb-
ruary 1977, about eight months ahead of appraisal estimates. Oil palm and
cover-crop establishment, and maintenance standards are satisfactory.
Residing settlers are being selected for the smallholder planting program
starting in October 1977. Smallholder plant material is raised in the
estate nursery where seedlings develop satisfactorily. The oil palm research
program is being reviewed by CDC and DPI. The first nursery fertilizer
trial has been laid out.
Credit No. 661   Education Project:  US$4.0 Million Credit of November 19,
1976; EIfective Date: January 3, 1977; Closing Date:
December 31, 1981
The project is helping to finance the expansion of five educational
institutions (in agricultural, health, primary and secondary teacher training,
and technical fields) and, in addition, supports planning and studies essen-
tial to long-term development of the education and training sector, including
an experimental program at five rural vocational centers. Generally, project
implementation is on schedule. Progress on civil works is satisfactory.
About two thirds of all civil works contracts have been awarded and construc-
tion has started at four out of five institutions. Equipment procurement and
recruitment of technical assistance experts are slightly behind schedule.
Both the Project Management Committee and the Office of Project Coordination
have been established. Disbursements are expected to be made on schedule.

Credit No. 677 Second Highlands Road Improvement Project;
US$19.0 Million Credit of January 28, 1977,
Effective Date: March 29, 1977;
Closing Date: June 30, 1981.
The project would improve and pave 68 km of the Highlands Highway.
It would, further, provide detailed engineering and feasibility studies of
the same highway, in preparation for further improvements in rural develop-
ment studies of the Enge and Chimbu Provinces, and technical assistance to
local civil engineering contractors. Civil works are proceeding generally
on schedule. The rural development studies will be delayed by about nine
months, pending completion of the appraisal of a rural development project
in the Southern Highlands, which should provide some useful lessons for the
Enge and Chimbu studies. Appointment of consultants for the technical-
assistance component is expected by June 1978.
