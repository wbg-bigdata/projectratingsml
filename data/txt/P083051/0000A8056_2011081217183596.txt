                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Implementation is progressing satisfactorily and the Project has already committed 89% of funds allocated to Alliances. Before the end of 2011, it is expected that the Project will
                         have surpassed its target number of alliances by 20%, though due to increases in unitary costs and new alliances having a smaller number of associated producers there is a risk that
                         the expected number of direct beneficiaries may not be reached.
