MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT:    Project Completion Report on Papua New Guinea
Yonki Hydroelectric Proiect (Loan 2722-PNG)
Attached is the "Project Completion Report on Papua New Guinea: Yonki Hydroelectric
Project (Loan 2722-PNG)" prepared by the East Asia and Pacific Region. The Borrower contributed
Part II of the PCR.
The objectives of the project were to: (i) reduce Papua New Guinea's dependence on
imported oil; (ii) provide for training and institutional support to the Electricity Commission, ELCOM;
and (iii) provide an institutional and policy framework for rural electrification. The completion of the
Yonki dam and the installation of 30 MW of generation at the existing RAMU-1 hydroelectric plant
met the first objective. The training, institutional development, and rural electrification components fell
significantly short of the planned level because of the lack of support given to them by ELCOM. The
project cost of US$141 million exceeded the original cost estimate by 25% because of additional civil
works made to ensure safety of the Yonki dam vis-a-vis a site land slide discovered during project
construction, and higher than estimated bids for the electro-mechanical equipment of RAMU-l
hydroelectric plant. The project was substantially completed by December 1991 and the Bank loan
closed in May 1993 to allow completion of minor works, one year later than the original closing day,
at which time US$1.86 million was canceled.
The project outcome is rated as satisfactory and its sustainability as likely -- ELCOM
enjoys a healthy financial position and possesses the necessary skills to operate and maintain its assets.
However, the institutional development impact is rated as negligible.
The PCR is satisfactory and provides a brief account of the project implementation and
results. No audit is planned.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PAPUA NEW GUINEA
YONKI HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT
(LOAN 2722-PNG)
Preface
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Yonki Hydroelectric Project in
Papua New Guinea, for which Loan 2722-PNG in the amount of US $28.5 million was
approved on July 19, 1986. The loan was closed on December 31, 1992, one year behind
schedule; an undisbursed balance of US $1,865,894.35 million was cancelled on May 18,
1993, the loan compleltion date.
Parts I and III of this PCR were prepared by the Industry and Energy Operations
Division, Country Department III of the East Asia and Pacific Region. A preliminary draft
of Part II, attached, was prepared by ELCOM, prior to the availability of these versions of
Parts I and III which have been sent to ELCOM with a request to provide final Part II which
will be incorporated in the PCR when received.
Preparation of this PCR was based on the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR); the Loan and
Project Agreements, Bank supervision reports, internal Bank memoranda, correspondence
between the Bank, the Borrower and ELCOM; ELCOM project progress reports, completion
reports prepared by ELCOM consultants on the civil works and generating equipment, and a
mission to Papua New Guinea in November 1993.

EVALUATION SUMMARY
Objectives
1.    The principal objectives of the Yonki Hydroelectric Project were to reduce PNG's
dependence on imported oil; provide for adequate training and institutional support to assist
ELCOM's development of its local staff; and provide institutional and policy framework for
rural electrification activities (Part I, para. 4).
Implementation Experience
2.    All the civil works for the Yonki dam and related works were completed and the
generating equipment was properly installed and is operating satisfactorily. However, the
project experienced a completion delay of nine months and a cost overrun of about US$ 24.7
million equivalent, or 24.8% compared to estimates at appraisal. The delays and cost
overrun were due principally to design modifications required to neutralize the effects of a
slide in the left abutment of the dam
(Part I, paras. 8 and 10).
3.    The project components relating to training and rural electrification were only
partially completed because ELCOM did not provide the necessary support to them in light
of the more pressing efforts and financing required for the Yonki works after the major
difficulties caused by the slide described above (Part I, paras. 12 and 13). Nevertheless,
ELCOM carried out expansion of its training facilities, and rural electrification activities with
its own resources, but outside the framework of the project (Part I, para. 26).
Results
4.    The project was generally successful, with its principal objective of reducing PNG's
dependence on costly imported oil fully achieved through the construction of the Yonki dam
and installation of two additional generating units at the Ramu I station, and successful
operation of the hydroelectric scheme. The institutional support to assist ELCOM's
development of its local staff, and the rural electrification study were completed, but certain
training activities and rural electrification were not executed because ELCOM gave priority
to expeditious completion of the Yonki dam and installation of the additional generating
equipment at the Ramu power station (Part I, paras. 10 to 13).
5.    In reexamining the least-cost analysis, the project would be the least-cost solution with
equalizing discount rates below 6 percent compared to 13.9 percent estimated at appraisal,
suggesting that the project cannot now be considered least-cost. The low equalizing discount
rate is due mainly to the current fuel price for comparable thermal schemes being about 50
percent lower and the investment cost of the Yonki hydroelectric project being about 25



- iii -
percent higher than those estimated at appraisal in September 1985. The ex-post internal
economic rate of return (IERR), calculated in a manner similar to that used in the SAR, is 9
percent, compared to the appraisal estimate of 16.5 percent, making the project economically
justified at the margin (Part I, paras. 16 and 18).
Sustainability
6.    The Yonki hydroelectric dam and the related additional two 15 MW generating units
at the Ramu power station are operating satisfactorily and should reliably maintain an
adequate level of benefits throughout their useful life, and there are no factors within normal
occurrence which should adversely affect this outcome (Part I, para. 22).
Lessons Learned
7.    The economic analysis of this hydroelectric project should have been carried out more
rigorously, especially when its net economic benefits were vulnerable to significant and
unexpected fluctuations in fuel prices for comparable thermal schemes; electricity demand
forecasts should have been tested closely against past trends, and significant loads expected in
the future should have been examined in depth with respect to their likelihood of
materializing (Part I, paras. 15 to 19, and 24).
8.    Implementation of training and rural electrification components could have been
carried out more effectively if the scope of these components and implications of the related
Bank procurement procedures had been made clear to ELCOM at the outset (Part I, paras.
20 and 24).

Background
1.   Papua New Guinea's (PNG) most abundant energy source is hydroelectric due to its
mountainous topography and heavy rainfall. The total hydropotential is one of the highest in
the world at nearly 6 kW per capita. However, because of the scattered concentrations of
electricity demand, large development of this resource has not been economically attractive.
Moderate gas discoveries had been made onshore and offshore but past explorations had only
yielded modest results and hydrocarbon resources appeared to be quite limited at the time of
appraisal. Since then, however, major petroleum findings are being exploited, giving PNG
reserves estimated at 600 million barrels with a proven volume of 215 million barrels, and
making it an exporter of crude. Natural gas reserves are estimated at 20 trillion cubic feet
(TCF) with a proved volume of 3 TCF since 1992.
2.   At the time of project appraisal in September 1985, PNG imported annually some
700,000 tons of petroleum products, representing about 90% of commercial energy
consumption in the country when electricity use was about 1,800 GWh, of which some 60%
was by the Bougainville Copper Ltd. and about 30% by the Papua New Guinea Electricity
Commission (ELCOM). The remainder was used by other mines and private entities. At the
end of 1992, ELCOM's total installed generating capacity was about 250 MW (161 MW of
hydro), compared to about 195 MW (117 MW of hydro) at the end of 1984; corresponding
energy productions were 624 GWh and 433 GWh. ELCOM is the national power company
that is responsible for public electricity supply throughout the country. It reports directly to
the Minister of Energy Development (MED). Government supervision is exercised primarily
through the ELCOM Board, rather than by MED.



3.   With heavy reliance on expatriates, ELCOM had managed its operations rather
effectively. However, prior to appraisal of the Yonki Hydroelectric Project, it had not been
successful in adequately preparing nationals to properly execute the expected future
expansion of the utility's operations. As a consequence, extensive training and institutional
support components aimed at furthering ELCOM's manpower development objectives were
included in the project.
Project Objectives
4.    The objectives of the Yonki Hydroelectric Project were to:
a) support a major hydroelectric development to reduce PNG's dependence on costly
imported oil;
b) provide for adequate training and institutional support to assist ELCOM's
development of its local staff resources; and
c) provide an institutional and policy framework for rural electrification activities.
Project Description
5.    The Yonki Hydroelectric Project comprised:
a) Construction of a 60 meters high earthfill dam on the Ramu River in the Eastern
Highlands, a spillway system and outlet structure, and associated works;
b) installation of two additional 15 MW generating units and step-up transformers at the
Ramu I power station;
c) relocation of about six kilometers of the Highlands Highway, and construction of
about 16 kilometers of local access roads above flood level near the reservoir area;
d) engineering and consulting services (for design of civil works, preparation of tender
documents, and construction supervision);
e) a training component, to include training specialists and upgrading of existing training
facilities, and overseas fellowships;
f) technical assistance for manpower development and institutional support, including
standardization of jobs and technical functions, and a technical audit; and
g) a rural electrification component, comprising extension of electricity supply in the
vicinity of the Yonki project (Arona Valley), a study to amplify on rural
electrification policy and standards, and execution of rural electrification pilot
projects.



- 3-
Project Design and Organization
6.    About three years before project appraisal, the Energy Planning Unit of the Policy
and Planning Division of the Ministry of Minerals and Energy began comprehensive energy
studies and planning with the objective of organizing and accelerating the oil and gas
exploration effort, and preparing appropriate development plans for other indigenous energy
rosources. This work was concurrent with that to define a sound expansion of power
generating and transmission facilities. The latter was mainly executed by ELCOM with the
assistance of consultants, who examined several power system expansion schemes involving
hydro and thermal plants for the Port Moresby and Ramu systems, as well as the
interconnection of the two major systems. As part of the power development program for
the two systems, the Yonki hydro electric project resulted as the least-cost scheme for the
Ramu system, and PNG requested Bank financing for it. The rural electrification, training,
and technical assistance components for specific manpower development and institutional
support were designed as required complementary investments.
7.    The concept for the investment component of the project was normal in content and
approach for a conventional power generation scheme. Training, manpower development
and institutional support components were designed to enhance the ability of ELCOM to meet
its future responsibilities. Overall, the project scope was commensurate with the utility's
financial capabilities. Nevertheless, it was the largest public sector undertaking in the
country's history. The investment component relating to the Yonki dam and generating
units, which comprised the project's main component (about 76 percent of base cost) was
well prepared. The project included a number of technical assistance components that, taken
together, were intended to increase the effectiveness of ELCOM's existing manpower and
institutional development efforts. The rural electrification pilot projects component was to be
developed in accordance with policy criteria that were to be established under the rural
electrification study included in the project.
Project Implementation
8.    The most significant changes between planned and actual project execution occurred
in the construction of the Yonki dam. The potential instability of the left abutment (looking
downstream) of the dam was not detected during the sound and comprehensive subsurface
exploration because latent slide surfaces are not visibly apparent even through a particularly
focussed ocular examination of core samples of alluvial conglomerates. However, the slide
became evident in June 1987 upon excavations on that side for the outlet works. Immediate
and appropriate measures were taken by ELCOM's engineering staff and consultants to
determine the extent of the slide before allowing further excavations there. After some two
months of field and laboratory investigations, measures were applied to stabilize the affected
zone of the abutment by lowering the water table through drilling of sand drains. Then the
downstream face of the dam was redesigned with a flatter slope and two berms were added
in order to maintain the required slide safety factors. These changes resulted in lengthening
the toe of the dam and the outlet works by 84 meters. As a consequence, the spillway also



- 4 -
had to be lengthened and realigned. Extensive additional hydraulic model testing was carried
out to determine the appropriate new shape of the flip bucket and plunge pool. The left
abutment failure increased the cost of the dam by about US $ 19.3 million equivalent, or
44.5 percent, and delayed construction completion by nine months.
9.    The probabilities of having detected the potential failure surface at the time of
subsurface investigations was remote because it was concentrated in a localized small area
(120 m by 80 m) not geologically distinct from the rest of the dam site, and as stated above,
latent slide surfaces cannot readily be detected by visual examination of core samples of
conglomerate alluvial deposits. Aside from this failure, all project risks were correctly
identified and appropriately gauged. With respect to the training component (12 percent of
project cost), and rural electrification (3.6 percent of project cost), the expenditures under the
project were significantly lower than the appraisal estimate, due mainly to ELCOM's desire
to follow its own procurement procedures that were inconsistent with the Bank's procurement
procedures stipulated in the Loan Agreement. Therefore, at the request of ELCOM and the
Borrower, the allocation of loan funds for the rural electrification pilot projects and
electrification in Arona Valley was reduced to zero. The actions taken that most affected the
project favorably were the effective and professionally sound performance of ELCOM's
project management team, and of the Yonki Project's Engineering Review Board (ERB).
Project Results
10.   The project achieved its principal objective of reducing PNG's dependence on costly
imported oil through the successful construction of the Yonki dam, installation of 2 new
15 MW generating unit at the Ramu I hydro station, putting them into commercial operation,
(albeit with a delay of nine months due to the slip failure in the left embankment), which has
reduced the consumption of imported fuel by an equivalent of about US $ 6.0 million per
year at 1992 prices. The required redesigns produced an increase in embankment volume of
about 800,000 cubic meters, 110,000 cubic meters of concrete, 1.6 million cubic meters of
excavation, and the lengthening of the spillway and outlet works by 84 meters which
produced an increase in total project cost of US$ 24.7 million. Most of this cost overrun
was for civil works, and financed by reallocation of the proceeds of the Bank loan and of the
funding from the cofinanciers of the project.
11.    A total of about eight days of work stoppage occurred during the five years of
construction. These stoppages resulted largely from several incidents of clashes between
national workers and the contractor's expatriate staff, and work stoppages caused by
disgruntled ex-landowners seeking additional compensation.
12.   The implementation of the training and rural electrification components fell
significantly short of the planned levels, largely due to apparent lack of support given to
them by ELCOM during project execution, as well as ELCOM's preference to follow its
own procurement procedures which were inconsistent with those stipulated by the Bank. The
following table summarizes the appraisal cost estimates and actual expenditures for the
various activities included in the training, manpower development and institutional support

13.   Of the US $3.6 million estimated at appraisal, for the rural electrification component,
only US $105,000 was spent for the rural electrification study that was successfully
completed. In comparison to the US $3.6 million estimated at appraisal for investments in
these works during a period of 2.5 years, ELCOM has currently programmed US$ 7.1
million for rural distribution throughout PNG for the next 9 years, or about half the yearly
average estimated in the SAR.
14.   The project had a significant effect on sectoral growth by the increase of 30 MW of
new hydro generating capacity. Its high services reliability and economic operation has
sharpened the planning focus of ELCOM on well-designed small hydro schemes as well as
more detailed examination on the merits of indigenous natural gas-fired turbine generating
equipment. However, the project did not adequately meet the objective of development of



- 6 -
ELCOM's human resources, except that ELCOM's staff, who directly participated in the
construction of the Yonki dam and installation of the two new generating units at the Ramu I
hydro station, gained valuable experience. In terms of the effects on the physical
environment, the dam blends harmoniously with the surrounding topography and the
enormous lake formed by the reservoir appears awesome in the highland terrain where such
bodies of water did not exist, and now has become a source of recreation in boating and
fishing, which in some way, tourism perhaps, could help alleviate poverty in its environs.
Least Cost Analysis
15.   The SAR presented statistics of growth in sales in the Ramu system averaging 4.7
percent per annum from 1975 to 1984, yet forecasted an annual growth rate almost double
that amount (8.7 percent) for the period 1985-1995, justifying the rapid growth by stating
that the forecast "included projections of new large consumers developed in the context of an
on-going power market survey of ELCOM's load centers," but these potential loads were
only broadly identified, although they appear to have constituted the main basis for the
forecast growth rate. The SAR also forecasted that the Ramu system would be the "fastest
growing supply system in PNG and surpass the Port Moresby system's total load in 1991",
and that the peak demand and energy generation for the Ramu system would be increased
from 32 MW and 179 GWh, respectively, in 1985 to 59 MW and 324 GWh in 1992. Actual
growth fell far short of the forecast levels, since from 1985 to 1992 the average annual
growth rate was 3.2 percent compared to the forecast 8.7 percent; generation was 194 GWh,
compared to the forecast of 324 GWh; and the peak demand was 41 MW, compared to the
forecast of 59 MW. In 1991, the Port Moresby system load of 57.5 MW surpassed Ramu's
41.1 MW, instead of the other way around.
16.   At appraisal, the Yonki hydroelectric project was selected as the least-cost expansion
scheme with equalizing discount rates ranging from 13.9 percent to 18.1 percent, when
compared with three different all-thermal schemes.  Due to a project cost overrun of US
$24.7 million (24.8 percent) and a 50 percent drop in fuel price for equivalent thermal
generation, the Yonki project would be a least-cost scheme only with discount rates below 6
percent (Annex 1). This suggests that the project cannot now be considered as the least-cost
scheme since the opportunity cost of capital in PNG is substantially higher than 6 percent.
However, such a low equalizing discount rate can be attributed largely to the higher than
estimated project investment cost, since a sensitivity test carried out at appraisal, for
variations in real oil prices between US$12 and US$20 per barrel, the equalizing discount
rate between the Yonki hydroelectric project and the closest alternative all-thermal scheme
varied between 12 percent and 14 percent, which according to the SAR met the Bank's
economic criteria.
Internal Economic Rate of Return
17.   The methodology used in the SAR to calculate the internal economic rate of return
(IERR) was to equalize the net present value of the economic costs and benefits attributable



to the project. The costs included (a) capital investment for the project, including associated
transmission; operation and maintenance costs; and recurrent costs associated with
distribution. Revenues from incremental sales derived from the project, and priced at the
average tariff level in 1985 of 13.7 t/kWh (US$ 0.137/kWh), were used as a measure of
economic benefits. The result of the calculation was an IERR of 16.5 percent.
18.   Using the same methodology as used at appraisal, but with actual investment costs,
and actual operation and maintenance, and other system operating costs and the average tariff
level in 1992 of 17.3 t/kWh (US$ 0.178/kWh), the ex-post IERR for the Yonki project is
estimated at 9 percent (see Annex 2), making the project economically justified at the
margin.
19.   A calculation of the IERR, using revenue from incremental sales as the sole measure
of benefits is an acceptable criterion in Bank appraisals of power projects to test the
adequacy of electricity tariffs to meet the revenue requirements of the utility. But such a
calculation is not a test of the adequate relationship of tariffs and the willingness, or
affordability by consumers to pay for the electricity service. As a result of the Yonki
project, ELCOM's electricity tariffs had to be substantially increased and are now among the
highest in the world, principally to cover the capital expenditures for Yonki. At appraisal,
the IERR for the investment was not tested for sensitivity against any changes in costs, or
lower electricity sales. The IERR exercise should have considered a wide range of variations
of costs and benefits, particularly since net economic benefits were highly sensitive to growth
in energy sales and investment costs.
Procurement
20.   With respect to ELCOM's request that the Bank loan finance training facilities
(building expansion), the Bank's position for disallowing it because of its interpretation that
only goods (but not civil works) were eligible under the training category was unhelpful.
ELCOM's request could have been accommodated through an appropriate amendment of the
Description of the Project (Schedule 2 to the Loan Agreement). A similar observation
applies to the Bank's insistence on international shopping for goods required for
implementing rural electrification schemes, since local shopping could have ensured
competitive prices and the procedure could have been more readily accommodated to
ELCOM's ongoing procurement practices in this field. The Bank's position did not
encourage ELCOM to use the Bank loan funds for this component.
Financial Performance
21.   The financial statements containing both appraisal estimates and actual results are
shown in Annex 3. ELCOM's financial performance compares favorably with appraisal
estimates for the period 1986-1992. However, due to a drop in net income from higher than
expected debt service, ELCOM has not paid dividends since 1990. Nonetheless, ELCOM
was able to comply with all financial targets agreed with the Bank, maintaining a satisfactory
self-financing ratio of not less than 30 percent. Its accounts receivable have held steady at
no more than 60 days in spite of high tariff level, but its accounts payable increased from an
adequate 2 months to 3.4 months, principally due to its greater debt burden.

Project Sustainability
22.   The Yonki hydroelectric project will certainly maintain an adequate level of benefits
at current electricity rates throughout its life by the substitution of petroleum products, and
reliable electricity generation. There are no factors within normal occurrence that could
adversely affect this outcome. But the most serious danger to the stability of the type of dam
at Yonki is that of an earthquake of very high intensity in its proximity. Nevertheless, on
October 13, 1993, it withstood without any noticeable or measured effects an earthquake with
an intensity of 7.2 with an epicenter some 40.0 kms from the dam, with estimated ground
acceleration of 0. 174g, compared to the maximum credible earthquake (MCE) design
magnitude for the Yonki dam of 7.3 at 14 km with a maximum ground acceleration of
0.57 g.
Bank Performance
23.   The Bank contributed to the preparation, execution, and financing of the project
through guidance, particularly through review commentaries on ELCOM's evaluation of
prequalification of bidders for the civil works. But after contract award for these works and
the subsequent resolution of dam foundation problems, Bank's field supervisions dropped
considerably to only six missions in the course of six years of project execution. However,
the nature of the project was such that more frequent Bank supervision missions would not
have significantly affected the project outcome.
24.   Lessons Learned
(a)   The economic analysis of the Yonki hydroelectric project should have been carried
out more rigorously. Sensitivity analysis for the IERR should have been carried out
using a wide band of variations in costs and benefits; and
(b)   Implementation of the training and rural electrification components of the project
could have been carried more effectively if ELCOM was, at the outset, clear about
the scope of these components and the implications of the stipulated Bank
procurement procedures.
Borrower Performance
25.   ELCOM performed well throughout project execution, and particularly during the
construction problems caused by the slide in the left abutment. The effective leadership
provided by ELCOM's staff was the salient and principal factor which contributed to the
overall success in the construction of the Yonki dam and installation of the two generating
units at Ramu.
26.   The institutional assistance provided under the project for training and rural
electrification was only partially successful, due primarily to lack of effective support for
these components by ELCOM, who was applying priority efforts to keeping the civil works
contract on track. Nevertheless, ELCOM has continued with the expansion of its training



facilities, and rural electrification activities with its own resources, but outside the framework
of the project.
Project Relationships
27.   The Bank relationship with the Government of Papua New Guinea, the cofinancing
entities, and ELCOM was satisfactory, particularly during project preparation.
Consulting Services
28.   The consultants for engineering and construction supervision performed well and
responsibly. They struck a good working relationship with the ERB when revised designs
were required due to the slide in the left abutment and throughout construction supervision.
The ERB's performance was very good and their participation contributed considerably to
diligent application of remedial measures to stabilize the slide and conclude quickly all
redesigns of the civil works. The other consultants contracted by ELCOM for training and
the rural electrification study completed their work on time and satisfactorily.
Project Documentation and Data
29.   The legal documents and Staff Appraisal Report for the project were adequate. While
the legal documents did not contain a specific provision for reporting on project progress,
ELCOM, nevertheless, prepared and submitted timely to the Bank periodic progress reports.
Bank staff provided ELCOM with a good outline for the progress reports, but the latter did
not follow them closely. As a result, the progress reports did not provide a clear overall
picture of the status of project implementation as time went by. Most of the reports of Bank
supervision missions were limited in content, and did not provide a complete picture.
30.   The Bank's regional files on this project were incomplete. For example, of
ELCOM's 19 quarterly reports only 7 were found. On the other hand, ELCOM's files were
complete and were the source of principal statistical data for the preparation of this PCR.

PART II - PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORROWERS PERSPECTIVE
1.    These notes on the Yonki Dam Hydroelectric Project have been prepared by the
Papua New Guinea Electricity Commission (ELCOM) who was the Implementing Agency for
the Borrower, the Papua New Guinea Government. The Department of Finance & Planning
of the PNG Government has delegated this project review to be undertaken by ELCOM on
their behalf.
2.    The main project components, both financially and technically, were the construction
of the sixty meter high earthfill dam and the manufacture and installation of two fifteen
megawatt hydroturbines. These components were fully and successfully completed. The
project has secured the power supply of the Ramu transmission grid well into the next
century and can be expected to contribute significantly to PNG's economic and social
development as both industrial and general consumers take advantage of a reliable and
economic power source.
3.    Implementation was not without its difficulties. As recorded elsewhere in this Project
Completion Report the major civil component had significant cost increases and suffered
some delay in completion. The predominant reasons for this were technical, with the
foundation conditions being significantly weaker than estimated in the tender design. Site
investigations had been extensive however and the re-evaluation of foundation conditions that
was required reflects the difficulty of assessing strength parameters from localized samples,
rather than any lack of input at the investigation stage.
4.    Great assistance was given to ELCOM throughout the project by the Engineering
Review Board who had been appointed on the advice of the World Bank. These three
experienced personnel were able to provide a technical overview of the dam design as sit
developed during construction and reassure ELCOM on the recommendations of the
Consultant. At times they appeared to evolve into more of a Design Board than a Review
Board and the Consultant was being constantly reminded not to use them in this role. Their
contribution was considered significant and similar Boards should be appointed for future
large power development projects.
5.    ELCOM's relationship with the World Bank can best be evaluated in two distinct
phases. The Pre Civil Tender Award Phase was marked by a close involvement by the Bank
in the design and tender details and an insistence on many matters being undertaken or
worded exactly in accordance with their instructions. This attention to detail was not
continued once construction commenced. The regular progress reports were acknowledged



- 11 -
but no commentary provided. The intermittent site visits recorded a general overview,
usually favorable, but little advice to reflect the Bank's experience in numerous international
construction projects.
6.    The initial dogmatic approach of the World Bank was accepted by ELCOM. The
occasion when it had a negative effect on the project was the Bank's insistence at the time of
the Civil Tender Evaluation, that the award price be identical to the bid price received. This
was despite their already being a significant change in some quantities, and, when tender
rates were applied to all tenders, the lowest tenderer retaining that position. The significance
of this was that the first variation order required an increase in the award price by some
twelve percent leaving very little contingency available before the Contractor could claim for
a revision of all the tender rates. The Bank's reluctance to agree to a logical award process
was never satisfactorily explained and the matter was eventually included in the arbitration
referrals at the end of the Contract.
7.    The inclusion of a significant training element for institutional strengthening was an
important aspect of the Project. However, it is noted that this element was never well
defined and cost estimates were general and vague. Accordingly, this portion of the funds
was not fully utilized. Some of the proposed elements involved small scale construction
work which pragmatically would only be undertaken by local construction firms.
Reimbursement for these works was not possible as they did not meet the Bank's
procurement guidelines which appear applicable for larger international projects only.
8.    The Rural Electrification portion of the project had similar difficulties of the scope
not being adequately defined at the time of loan procurement. The consultancy which
identified and ranked various Rural Electrification projects for implementation was
successfully completed. Funding for actual construction was limited however as ELCOM did
not obtain the physical components used under international tender procedures acceptable to
the Bank. ELCOM's standard procedures for similar work throughout the country were
used.
9.    It is therefore concluded that while the core components of the project were
successfully defined and constructed, the peripheral elements not directly related to the dam
project itself, were added without the same attention to the implementation methodology.
The need for extra elements in a loan package not directly related to the main project should
be reviewed. If included, realistic funding targets should be set based on an implementation
plan rather than an arbitrary allocation. It would also be helpful if the Bank established
separate procurement guidelines for the small local construction elements of a project where
the application of International Competitive Bidding Procedures is obviously impractical.
10.   ELCOM's own performance during the evolution of the project was mainly
responsive or driven by the various requirements of the three funding agencies and advice of
the Engineering Review Board and the Consultant. The momentum was maintained by
ELCOM's persistent liaison with the funding agencies especially the World Bank. ELCOM



- 12 -
should share some responsibility with the Bank however for not clearly establishing the
funding and local procurement components of the Training and Rural Electrification
elements.
11.   ELCOM's performance during the implementation phase was complicated by the
project being located at an existing operational site. The various tasks required of an
implementing agency, especially in areas of local socio-economic management,
environmental work, personnel management, general administration and stores procurement;
therefore became scattered within the operational organization, with the project group losing
some ability to action matters expeditiously. Future major projects would benefit from the
project team being given higher level of internal autonomy.
12.   The Co-Financiers were the Overseas Economic Co-operation Fund of Japan (OECF)
and the European Investment Bank (EIB). Once these banks accepted the lead role proffered
by the World Bank, despite the major donor being the OECF, their input to the project was
advisory. The EIB did however at time review the project status with rigor and advised
ELCOM, both formally and informally, on areas of management they thought could be
improved. Such input was appreciated by ELCOM as an outside overview and was always
pertinent as the one project engineer was retained by the EIB throughout and hence he had a
full appreciation of the project history. This continuity of staff was not evident from the
World Bank and should be encouraged for future projects for any problems which develop to
be properly understood and handled within the context of the project history and previous
interaction between parties.
13.   Once the procedures for disbursements were established, these proceeded with only
occasional minor administrative difficulties and the co-operation of all parties is appreciated.
ELCOM considers its own administration of the different funding agencies requirements for
the various contracts and financial elements to have been particularly effective.
14.   In conclusion it is considered the project has been successfully completed. The
funding arrangements were utilized to construct a facility that will provide multiple benefits
for future generations and a power supply stability that will promote economic growth. The
peripheral aspects of the loan package not directly related to the main project proved difficult
to implement due to their high local components not easily proceeding under the Bank's
procurement guidelines involving International Competitive Bidding. Those aspects aside,
the main project proceeded in a professional manner despite some major technical and
contractual difficulties being encountered. The contribution by the three funding agencies
and the World Bank in particular for their lead role is acknowledged and appreciated.
