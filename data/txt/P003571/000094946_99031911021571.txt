Supplementary Description of A REPORT ON ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF WUCHANG-GUANGZHOU RAILWAY CAPACITY EXTENDING PROJECT
USING WORLD BANK LOAN (TIIE VERSION OF 1998)
On 1998/12n7, the environmental expert Mr.Somani proposed some recommendations on the modification of this report at the Beijing Office of World Bank. On the basis of
these, the report maker, the 4"' Survey and Design Institute of MOR, made the modifications and supplements. Now the specific contents are attached as follows (Details are
shown in Appendix I - 4) and will be used as part of the report and submitted together to World Bank.
The modifications and supplements are mainly in 4 aspects as follows:
1.  On Table A-2
It is required that the cost of land acquisition, house removal and resident settlement shall be separated from the environmental investment of ecological part in Table A-2.
Therefore, all the data in the table are rechecked. The modified Table A-2 is shown in Appendix 1.
2.  On the issue of ventilation
In Clause IV of Item 111, the description of installing air-conditioners and ventilators is lost in the English translation. The corrected translation of the original report is
shown in Appendix 2.
3.  On the noise control measures and effects
It is required that a column of effects produced by the noise control measures shall be added in Table E-4. As a result, the modified Table E-4 is shown in Appendix 3.
4.  On the supplements of the schools and hospitals along the line
The schools listed in the original report are based on the noise level of 6OdBA. These schools, which are seriously disturbed by the railway noise, are to be provided with
specific protection measures. The schools and hospitals slightly disturbed by the railway noise and with the noise level less than 6OdBA, which may not be provided with
protection measures, have not been listed in the report. It is required that all the schools about 100m far from the line should be supplemented and whether protection
measures should be provided or not according to a criteria of 55dBA. Therefore, Appendix 4 summarizes the schools and hospitals about JOOm far from the line and the
impacts on them and puts forward corresponding measures.It is necessary to point out that the measures proposed in Appendix 4 are the measures based on the criteria of
55dBA.If it is considered with 6OdBA approved by the State Bureau of Environmental Protection, all the measures may be canceled.

Appendix 2
The III paragraph:
[1. The above analysis shows that the noise impact is a major disturbance to the Hengyang No.7 Railway School, Shaoguan No.2 Railway School, Guangzhou No.4 Railway
School and Guangzhou No.2 Railway High School. It is required that protection measures should be adopted for the above-mentioned schools. In consideration of the schools'
locations in densely-populated area, for convenience of railway staff's children's going to schools and difficulties of the school's relocation, it is required to enclose corridor
windows on all floors of the school's teaching buildings and install air-conditioner and ventilation facilities in classrooms. All these mitigation measures will reduce railway
noise by 15 - 2OdBA. The cost is estimated in Table E-7.

A. Summary
A. I Brief Desription
1 . Wuchang - Guangzhou Railway Line is a part of Beijing - Cuangzhou Railway, which goes from south to north
and is a main artery of transportation in China. It starts frorn the north of Wuchang, ends at the south of
Guangzhou, crossing three provinces - Hubei, Huiian and Guiangdong, and connecting cities - Wuhan,
Changsha, Zhuzhou, Hengyang and Guangzhou . The line is an important trunk line in central south arca of China
linking up central, north, northeast, northwest, east China and southwest areas. The single track railway line
from Wuhan to Hengyang was built at the beginning of this century and it was double - tracked in the 1970s.
The single track railway line from Hengyang to Guangzhou was built in the middle of the 1930s and it was double
- tracked in 1988. Since 1978, China has speeded up its pace of reforTn and opening to the outside world and
the national economy in Guangdong, Hubei and Hunan have been developing rapidly, thus causing passenger
and freight traffic volumes in the three provinces increasing sharply. Growth rates of railway passenger and freight
tumover were 8.3% and 20.7% respectiyely in these three provinces in the year 1991, being about 2.5 times
as much as those of China's average growth rates of passenger and freight turnover. The design capacity of the
line is lower than the actually transported volume.. Railway stations and line capacity are far from satisfying the
increasing demands of transportation. Thus it is badly in need of expansion.
2. According to the reply of the State Planning Comnmission document No JJ ( 1983 ) 14 on Electrification Design of
Zhenzhou - Wuchang Section and Hengyang - Guangzhou Section of Beijing - Guangzhou Railway line and the
notice of the Planning Department MOR - JC 1N ( 1992 ) 102 on Feasibilitv Study of Electuification
Reconstruction Project of the Wuchang - Hengyang Section of the Beijing - Guangzhou Railt.sav Line, the 4th
Survey and Design Institute of MOR drafted the Feasibility Study of the Wuhan - Hengyang Section and Concise
Prelirninary Design of Hengyang - Guangzhou Section for the Electrification Reconstruction Project of the
Wuchang - Guangzhou Section in 1992. On the basis of it, the Feasibility Study Report of the Expansion Prject
of Wuhan - Guangzhou Section Using the 7th World Bank Loan was reported. With on the related technical
parameters of the report of 1994 version, the EIA of Wuchang- Guangzhou Railway Capacity Expansion Project
using World Bank Loan was completed and submitted to the World Bank in May 1994.
3. According to the notice of IOR - NQ JC (1998) 23 on Revised Technical Design of Eicetrification
Reconstruction of the Wuchang - Guangzhou Section of the Beijing - Guangzhou Railway Line, which has
adjusted the contents and design principle of this project. It has made clear that the design of electrification
should make use of the existing equipment and facilities so as to minimize the technical reconstruction project. It
I



has adjusted the passenger and freight traffic volume on the principle of Beijing - Guangzhou Railway Line taking
passenger traffic as its main service and Beijing - Jiulong Railway Line taking the freight traffic as its main
service. The 4th Survey and Design Institute of MOR has revised the ELA of 1994 version, newly predicted and
assessed the environmental impact caused by the change of the project and has adjusted and supplemented the
related chapters.
4. The main technical conditions of the line before and after capacity expansion are shown in Table A - 1.
The main construction projects are as follows:
* Electrification of the whole section (Details are shown in Tab c - 5 - c - 10)
* Local construction and expansion for stations and yards and siding expansion for intennediate stations (Details
are shown in Tab c - 5 - c - 10)
* Local reconstruction for track and bridge (Details are shown in Tab c - 5 - c - 10)
* New Construction and reconstruction for locomotives, communication and signalling, power supply and others
(Details are shown in Tab c - 5 - c - 10) .
The total investment of the project is RMB 6871.90 million yuan. It is estimated to acquire 154 hectares of
land, relocate 171955 m2 of houses and resettle 8668 persons.

A.2 Conclusions
A.2.1  Environment status                                                                                     f
5. By summarizing the investigation and monitoring results of various environrmental elemeni% on the basis of the
current status, Wuhan - Guangzhou Railway passes through the following mrajor cities as Wuchang, Yueyang,
Changsha, Zhuzhou, Hengyang, Shaoguang and Guangzhou. In passing thomugh these cities, usually there are
dense residential quarters, schools, kindergardens and other sensitive facilities on both sides of the line. Train
operation, narshalling and whistle of locomotive servicing operations in the city areas make the Leq value of a
distance 30m away from main stations and lines approach or exceed the required railway boundary noise limit
value of 70 dBA. At the sane time,ssmoke dust produced by operation in narshalling yards and district stations
causes unfavorable effect on atmospheric environment nearby. In short, railway operation impact on environmnent
is mainly concentrated in city areas and station areas where marshalling yard and district station are located.
6. Except the Shaoguan Locornotive Depot, all depots have their oil - contained waste water treated to meet the
discharging standard of contaninants produced from locomotive and car inspection and repair and locomnotive
servicing operation before discharging. Therefore, the function of the receiving water will not be changed.
7. In Wuchang, Changsha, Guangzhou, Zhuzhou and other major cities, the field strengih of TV signal is quite
strong, reaching or approaching the normal requirement of receiving and watching in most cases. In Hengyang,
Leiyang, Chenzhou, Shaoguan and Xinjie stations, the field strength of TV signal of several channels is rather
low and does not reach the national standard. Moreover, electromagnetic waves emitted from welding machines
and hgih pressure switches cause a rather high radio interference background noise and the signal noise ratio
lower than 35dB in most cases. These conditions have already affected the residents to watch TV nonnally.
8. At present, passenger trains running on Wuchang - Guangzhou Line discharge 28010. 8 tons of refuse and
528.6 x 104 fast food boxes every year. Because the railway transportation administrations have enhanced
administering the passenger train refuse, especiallv collecting the boxes, the White - Contamination - Belt along
the railway line has been basically controlled.
9.The Leq value of a distance 30m away from the outside rail on several sections of Wuchang - Cuangzhou
Railway Line is 0.8 - 9.8dB(A) more than the noise value stipulated by the standard due to the noise released
by locomoiive whistle and train operation. The impacted area mainly concentrates in city areas where the line
passes through and the residents closer to the line are disturbed by the noise for some historical reasons. Most of
the line are in the countryside field wlhere there are few sensitive facilities, so, basically, there are no
disturbance.
10. The environmental vibration value at 30m away from the both outside rails will be lower than the value of 80
4



dB stipulated in the "Urban Area Environmental Vibration Standards".
A.2.2 Environmental forecast
11. Prediction and calculation show that the opening of the electrified railway will bring about a large increase of
field strenth of instantaneous electomagnetic interference when an electric locomotive passes through the
residential area and cause a drop of signal noise ratio of TV at a different extent. In Xinjie, Chenzhou, Leiyang
and other cities, several TV channels will be affected when an electric locornotive passes by. Since thc passing
time of a locomotive is only 6 - 12 seconds and if it is 71 - 94 pairs locomotives per day in near the year 2000
and 84 - 104 pairs locomotives per day the year 2005, the time- interference ratio will be about 1.9 - 2.7% .
That means residents' watching TV have 97 % of the time free from the interference of the electric locomotives.
The main reason for several TV channels affected is the weak field strength of the TV signals. Since most stations
along the line are now setting up or have set up closed - circuit TV networks, the project will not give much
affect to TV watching. Based on GB8702 - 88 "Regulation on Electromagnetic Radiation Protection" and related
foreign infornation, it is predicted that high frequency electromagnetic radiation and powerful electric field of
industrial frequency coming from power supplying network of the contact system, traction substation and traction
power switching on - off station will not cause significant influence on human health.
12. After the completion of the project, the total number of train pairs will be basically unchanged. The rnning
speed will be a little bit raised. Therefore, the wheel - rail noise will still be the main noise pollutioni source of
the railway sections. The wagon running noise is larger than that of the coach. As the proportion of the number
of wagon pairs to the total numnber of train pairs decreases, even if the train running speed has a bit increase, the
overall noise level will be basically the same as the corrent status, for the latter is offset by the formner.
13. The production sewage of Wuchang - Guangzhou Railway Line is rnainly from the locomotive depot and
tumaround depot. Before and after the expansion of most stations and points such as Changsha, Zhuzhou, ete,
the value of change for the water quality and quantity does not exceed ± 10% . It will continue to use the
existing sewage treatment facility or add some treatment plants. For some of the stations and points without
sewage treatment plants, such as Yueyang Locomnotive Depot and Shaoguan Locomotive Depot, etc, the
corresponding treatment facilities will be added in this project so as to make the sewage discharge meat the
standard. The sewage after treatment discharged to the local receiving water will not change the original function
of use. Detailed measures are shown in A. 3 and E. 2.4.
14. After.the project completion, coal and fuel oil consumption will have a drop of 42. 8% and 92.0%
respectively and the amount of main atmospheric pollutants - dust, S02, NOR, CO discharging will have a drop
of 93.6% ,67.2% ,85 .8%  and 56.9%  respectively. The quality of atnospheric environment along the line will
be improved significantly, especially the quality of atmospheric environment around main station areas and
locomotive servicing operation sites. According to the investigation, the power for the electrified railway comnes
5



from the power network of Central and South China. The power plants are distributed totally in the districts of
Central and South China. The power is mainly generated by heat power. The power consumption added for this
electrification all falls within the design capacity of the original power plants. Dust rernoval measures are all
taken for the smoke discharge of the boilers of the power plants and the discharge is up to the national standard
and falls within the scope of the local total control amount. The waste residue of the boilers as the materials of
brick making and road paving is widely used in building trade. Therefore, the addition of the power consumption
of this project will not cause new impact to the local environment.
15. As the pairs of passenger trains increase, it is predicted that fast food boxes discarded will reach 601.1 x
I() and 656. 6 x I04 in the year 2000 and 2005 respectively, with an increase of 13. 6% and 24. 2% in
comparison with the corrent status, The passenger truain refuse will also have a large increase. The railway
transportation administration has fomnulatcd strict system for collccting and recycling the passenger train refuse
and the fast food boxes, thus the "White - Contanination - Belt" can be completely controlled.
16. Since the electrification of the Wuhan - Guangzhou Line is on the basis of double - track line, the line will
occupy 154 hectare of land, relocate 171955m2 of houses and resettle 8668 persons. The number is not so large
and they are distributed on a wide area of 1081km long, MOR will entrust the State Bureau of Land
Administration of local provinces to conduct land acquisition, relocation and resettlement and give compensation
to them in line with the requirement of the state and local governrment to ensure that the fanners and involved
residents to get a reasonable compensation and lead a better life. Details are shown in the report of land
acquisition and house removel for reference.
17. The project will enable the line to obtain not only direct economic returns of RMB 0.51 billion yuan and
RMB 1.3 billion yuan in years 2000 and 2005 respectively, acunulating sum of profit and loss of RMB 0. 17
billion and RMB 1. 29 billion yuan in years 2000 and 2005 respectively, but also significant indirect social
benefits. The completion of the project will promote the development of industrial enterprises and related service
sectors, thus causing a booming economy.
18. There are many famous cultural and historic sites and scenic spots along the line. Besides Yellow Crane
Tower, which is very close to the line, all other sites and spots are more than 500m awav from the line. The
project will have no harmfil effect to these sites and spots. Precautions against earthquake have been considered
in the construction of the Yellow Crane Tower. Train operation will cause no harmful effect on the Tower.
19. To sum up, the project will drive the economy development of the provinces along the line and the railway
system itself will also have a significant benefit. After the project completion, quality of atmospheric environment
along the line will be improved for the adoption of electrical traction. Waste water discharging from different
pollution sources will be treated to meet environmental requirements. Both the increasing of passenger train pairs
and the decreasing of freight train pairs hardly make the noise level change except the slight increasing of the
6



noise level in some section and make the amount of passenger train refuse increase a little. The above
environmental problems can be controlled effectively after the implementation of recommendations and measures
mentioned in this report. In weighing up the gains and losscs of differcnt environmental elements, the project is
feasible.
A. 3 Measures and Recommendations
20. In order to effectively control the environmnental impact of the project, the following major measures and
recommendations against environmental impacts will be taken as follows:
Construction period
I . When soil borrow operation, the construction unit should move and lay aside humus topsoil of the borrow -
pit and put it back after the completion of borrowing for vegetation recovering or protective structures. Dry rubble
masonry should be adopted for tunnel spoil site not to cause mudflow. In the dry season, water spraying to
reduce dust should be taken for construction sites and transportation access roads to reduce the influence to the
plants nearby. After the construction cornpletion, all wastes should be cleared away firom construction camp so
that the site becomes farmland again.

C.2 Construction Analysis
33 Table C-5 and Table C-10 shows that the Wuchang-Guangrhou capacity expansion project covers extensive
areas and needs large amount of investrent. It is very complicated and arduous for construction. The construction
block diagram Fig. C-2 of the project is worked out on the basis of the major construction contents and the
schedule of the construction listed in Table C-12.
34 When the capacity expansion project is completed, the traffic capacity and volume of the line will increase
by a big margin. It will be such a railway system in which a smooth north - south trafic truck line is provided
with perfect coordinate operation of stations, locomotive service, rolling stock. communications, signals and
36



electrification facilities and various departments interworking very closely. It is very difficult to illustrate the
specific operation of the complicated system. Fig C - 3 - Fig. C-7 briefly generalize the nmain famework of its
operation procedures.
C .3 Identification and Screening of the Environental Impacts of the Project
35. The project will cause a series of environmental impacts, either during its construction period or operation
period. According to the a,alysis on the prmject' s nature and locations, the main environmental impacts are
shown in Table C-13 and Table C-14.
36 Table C-13 summarizes its main environmnental impacts and their degrees. Here is the additional explanations.
I . he land acquisition, building removals and residents resettlement caused by the project will permanently
destroy the fann crops and vegetations w ithin the land acquired. Residents relocation will inevitably affect their
living quality. If the urban land is acquired, the building removals wil temporarily cause urban traffic congestions
and damage the urban landscape.
!I.Construction sites and accessroad will bring about unfavourable influence to farm crops, vegetations, soil
urban traffic congestions urban landscape, etc, mneanwhile, produce certain amnount of spoil, muck and noise
pollution.
.4
m . The strikingly hamful irmpacts caused by infriastructure construction and earthwork and stonework shall be
those to soil, vegetation, farm crops and urban landscape and construction noise and vibration interference.
IV . 'he main environmnental impacts caused by the tiansportation of equipment and building materials and earth
- and - stone - works are noise interfercnce and dust rising in the air. Furthennore, it will bring about trafic
pressures on the related roads.
V .The main environrnental impacts during tunnel construction are the large amount of spoil, blast vibration
interference and snall amount of waste water be construction and the rising dust in the air.
1I . Bridges and culverts are relatively few for this project. The main environrnental impacts are the disturbance
to the soil during pile foundation constnrction and the turbidity increase of water of rivers and ponds caused by
the pit spoil and drainage.
Ml.Track and houses constructions make noise and vibration, interferences to the surroundings and much
constructi&n refuses wiU offend the eye.
VI . The afforestation and restoration constructions after the completion of the major parts of the project will bring
back a good conpensation to the environment along the line.
Table C-13 and Table C-14(attached)
37.Generally speaking,except a few activities like land acquisition, building removal and residents resettlement,
37



which will bring permanent impacts due to the construction of the project, all others will only temporarily affect
the environment and can be restored by taking preventive and remedial measures.
38.Tabel C-14 generally gives the main harmfil impacts and degrees to environment by the construction of the
project. Here is some specific analysis.
I . Whether the capacity expansion project is conducted or not, the Wuchang-Guangzhou section of the Beijing-
Guangzhou Railway, as busy tund line. has its own strikingly harmful impcts, that is the noise pullution on the
environment. The main noise resources include train running, shunting and loading-unloading operation at
stations; the locomotive servicing and broadcastings both at stations and yards and other high noise equipment,
etc.
II . Generally speaking, the above-mentioned noise interference resources are also the vibration interference
resources, which produce somewhat vibrating interference. Nevertheless, their impact range has been proved to
be limited.
Ul . The electrification railways inevitably produce electromagnetic radiation. As far as the intensity of the
interferenec resources is concemed, the locomotive under operation and servicing is the most stricking one and
the second is the power supplying equipment like the tractive substations.
LV.The water environment impacts during the operation period include the waste.,water discharged from the
washing of passenger car servicing, and from the inspection and repair of rolUing stocks.
V .The electrification construction will greatly reduce atmospheric pollution along the railway line caused by
railway. However, the diesel locomnotives for shunting will still produce small amount of exhaust gas. In addition,
the boilers for production and living in each working unit will also discharge sorne atmospheric pollutants.

VI . After the completion of the capacity expansion project, the passenger traffie volume will havc agreat increase,
thus bringing about large amount of passengers refuse along the line and at main stations. The boiler slags and
scrap metals at stations, depots and sections are solid wastes to be properly disposed.
M Tlbe project will not only relieve the tension on railway trafic among cities and the cities'outkirts but also
pmmote the social, economic and cultural development along the line and obtain good social environmnent
benefits.
39 The environmental impact duing the railway operations period will be perment. Viewing the environmental
impact range and its extent, the rajor factors are social and cultural environrmental impact, noise and vibration
pollution, electromagnetic radiation and the polluted water pollution while other environmental impacts are rather
small.
C.4   Ener  and Water Consunption and Total Pollutant Discharge Volume
40  The environmental impacts caused by railway construction are closely related with energy and water
consumption. When the project is completed, the types of locomotives running between Wuchang and Guangzhou
will be changed from the diesel ones into the electnc ones. And all the shunting work along the line will use
diesel locomotives. As a result, the consumption of oil and coal will tremendously reduce, but the consumption of
water will increase, Table C - 15 lists the total consumption volume of energy and water of the whole Wuchange
- Guangzhou line and the main working units along the line before and after the project completion.

41. All the factors,such as noise and vibration interferences along the Wuchang - Guangzhou line, the production
and domestic sewage, the exhaust gas from locomotives and boilers, the solid refuse, the electromagnetic radiation
and other railway pollution resources and their pollutant discharge volume will change after the project
completion. Table C - 16 - Table C - 20 sunmmarizes the intensities of the railway noise, vibration,
electromagnetic radiation and the whole emission volume of major pollutants and the changes before and after the
project completion. Here are some additional explanations.
I There are not much changes for the railway noise resources, vibration resources and their intensities (Details
are shown in Table C - 16) . But the interference levels of the railway noise along the line depend on different
areas. For the noise impacts, some areas get worse while as others get better.
II  The electromagnetic interferences of electrification railway mainly include the radio noise created by the
sliding friction between locomotive pantograph and catenary and the discharge noise generated by loose contact
between catenary insulators and the electromagnetic radiation from the strong electric field of comierical
freguency under the catenary. When the project is completed, the electromagnetic radiation at the areas along the
line will somewhat increase, but the interference field intensity at Chenzhou - Shaoguan section - the existing
electrified district will decrease. (Details are shown in Table C - 17).
Im  The water consumption and the waste water discharge volume of each working unit along the line will
increase after the project completion; but with the change of the locomotive types, the contaminated water rnight
be expected to be cleaned. (Details are shown in Table(C - 18).
IV  With the implementation of the electrification, the discharge volume atmospheric air pollutant will be notably
lessened. (Details are shown in Table C - 19).
V The change of locomotive type with eliminate boiler slags frorn steam locomotives, and the slags' emission
volume will be reduced. considerable increase of the passenger traffic volume and the railway establishment will
bring ab'out enormous increase of passengers' domestic refuse and stuff refuse (Details are shoron in Table C -
20).

D. Description of Environment
D. I Natural Ecological Environent
D. 1. I Topography and landform
42. The area where Wuhan - Guangzhou Railway goes on features complicated topography and landforn. The line
passes the edge of Jianghan Plain and hilly land less than 700 metres above sea level, with parallel valleys and
ridges distributed along river valley is the agricultural area. The Yueyang - Changsha section crosses mainly
Dongtinghu Plain and part of hilly land. The section between the south of Changsha and Lechang of Guangdong
Province passes through the hilly land and Nanling mnountain area. The Nanling mountainous area is the
watershed between Yangtze valley and Zhujiang valley. Its northem foot and mountain top are widely erosive low
- mountain area, with gentle slopes, and wide valleys; the southem foot of mountain slopes are steeper and the
high mountains and deep valleys rise and fall continuously. Lechang - Shaoguan Railway lies on second - class
river valley terrace, and in low and gentle hills in Wushui and Zhengshui, with gentle mound. Shaoguan -
Guangzhou section is low in south and high in north. The northemn part is low rountain or hilly land and the
southem part belongs to Guanghua Plain with flat terrain.
43. Vegetation develops in low nountains, hilly land and mountain ridges along the line and valley and terraces
on both banks of the river have been changed as cultivated land.
D. 1.2 Geological characteristics
44 The area between Wuchang and Yueyang subsiding belongs to Yangtze Subsiding region, and the rock is
mainly sand - shale, quartz sandstone, limestone, marl and grit stone The area between Yueyang and Changsha
is mainly formed by laterite and mud in modem lakes. The part between Changsha and Chenzhou lies in
constitutional unit like Zhuheng Basin, and lithologic charactors are mainly clay, laterite, sand cobble and red
rock system. The part between Chenzhou and Pingshi belongs to Xinhuaxia system construction in Nanling area,
and lithological characters are red sandrock, mud rock, shale and grit stone and part of the area outcrops
limestone. The region from Pingshi to Lechang belongs to yaoshan anticlinorium constitutional area, and is
mainly constituted by metamorphic rock system. The part between Lechang and Shaoguan lies in the joint point
of the eastem wing of Yaoshan' s anticlinoriumn and Shaoguan' s syndinoriuni, and rocks are mainly limestone,
sand - shale and red rock system. The area from Shaoguan to Guangzhou is geologically complicated, with large
lithological variance and mainly have marsh sedimentarg deposit formed by silty clay and distributed in valleys
and on part of river terraces along the line. Bed rock are mnainly metamorphic rock system, such as quartz
schist, mica schist, shale, slate, etc.

Yueyang Tower, which lies on the bank of Dongting Lake and is one of the three most famous towels in ancient
times, Yuelu Mlountain scenic area and Mawangdui Han Dynasty Tombs in Changsha, It also has Suxianling
which gained its fame after Beisong Dynasty in Chenzhou. Guangzhou is the famous cultural and historical city
with a lot of places of historic interests and scenic spots, attracting many Chinese and foreign tourists.
Guangdong Province also has Jinjiling in Pingshi whose peculiar natural scenery has now become a farnous
sightseeing place.
D. 3 Analysis of Environmental stats along the Line
58. At present, the pollution caused by the operation of the Wuhan - Guangzhou Railway is mainly. 1 noise and
vibration caused by passenger - freight traims rnning and marshalling operation, exhaust gas generated by
locomtives and trains, slags from steam  locomotives and electromagnetic radiation generated by electric
locomotives in Chenzhou - Shaoguan section. The pollution has attracted much attention because they cover a
large area. 2) waste water, exhaust gas, noise and solid waste produced by locomotives, vehicle maintenance,
service operation and other railway facilities. Since these facilities are limited in one area, their pollution
intensity depends on discharge density and total amount of pollutants and local requirement for environment
quality. The assessment gives a necessary monitoring and investigation on the present status of noise, vibration,
electromagnetic and water environment as well as statistics of discharge amount of CO, NOx, SO2, TSP and solid
garbage from railway facilities. Monitoring methods adopted are in line with the "Environmental Monitoring and
Analysis Method"and "Unified Methods on Monitoring and Analysis of Pollution Sources". Analysis of present
environment elements is described as follows:
D.3.1 Noise
59. According to the recent spot inspection to the representative sections and the flow of trains, the noise of trains
along the Wuhan - Guanghou line has somewhat changed. T'he environmental noise monitored 30m away from
the outer rail is shown in TABLE D - 1.

are beyond standards (the excess is within 0. 3 - 9. 8 dBA) This is mainly caused by locomotive whistles and
train noise. In some sections locomotive whistles last several ten seconds continuously each hour, affecting the
sensitive point nearby to some extent. Office and teaching buildings of kindergarten in Yueyang Railway area are
only 7m away from siding and 30m away from the Beijing - Guangzhou tnunk line, so their Leq value reaches
67.7 dBA during daytime and 72.7 dBA at night. Due to some residential areas adjacent to the main line in
Changsha, Zhuzhou, Hengyang, Chenzhou, Shaoguan and Guangzhou, their Leq value reaches 63.3 - 78.2
dBA during daytime and 63.0 - 79.4 dBA at night. However, quite a part of the line lies on the the outskirts of
cities or countryside where there are comparatively less residents and rarely - located sensitive points, the railway
noise has a minor environental impact.On the basis of the principle of "putting the noise sensitive points in the
first place and making consideration by combining the points with the railway line", this report has made key -
point investigation and monitoring to the important noise sensitive point such as schools and hospitals within the
scope of 120 - 150m on both sides of the railway line. The seriously affected units by the noise are only Yueyang
Railway Kindergarten , Hengyang Railway No. 7 Prinary School, Shaoguam Railway No. 2 Primary School,
Guangzhou Railway No.4 Primary School and Guanzh   Railway No.2 High School . Key - point assessment is
made in this report.
D.3.2  Vibration
61.Table D - 2 shows monitoring conclusion of part of vibration sensitive points on the Wuhan - Guangzo
Railway. The vibration - sensitive Yellow Crane Tower's vibration level is below 70 dB, during daytime and 67
dB at night as a criterium in downtown area required by the GB10070- 88 "Urban Area Environment Vibration
Standard" . The vibration value measured outside liamming New Building in Zhuzhou is 65. 1 dB, below the
standard of 75 dB for daytime and 72 at night for residential , cultural and educational areas. The Yueyang
Railway kindergarten seven metres away from special line and 30m away from main line has its vibration
measurement value on cemnent ground outside its buildiog being 78.3 dB, which is lower than 80 dB the State
standard, value. Its largest vibration level is 98. 1 dB( when train passes on the siding), surpassing the singular
vibration level standard value which has maximun margin of 10 dB during daytime and 3 dB at night.

62. Measuring results shows that railway vibration does not have hamiful impacts to vibration sensitive points
except the Yueyang Railway Kindergarten which is closer to railway for historical reason.
D .3.3 Electromagnetic Environment
63. The Wuchang - Guanghou double - track line is not electrified except the Chenzhou - Shaoguan section.
According to a lot of site investigation and electronagnetical field intensity monitoring, main electrmagnetical
pollution resources of non - electrified railway are usually highway autos and large power electric switch
equipment in the area near the line. While electromagnetical pollution of electrified line comes from discharge
spark produced by transient separation of pantograph of electric locomotives from contact systern and also from the
discharge spark caused by unsatisfactory insulation of contact components. Both of the discharge phenomnena can
produce wide - frequency radio noise, nmaking radio - frequency pollution along the line, but the fonner pollution
is inevitable under normal operation of locomotives and can not be eliminated, It is the main electromagnetic
pollution resource of electrification railway. Besides, research and measurement demonstrate that since tractive
substation has not large power cornmutators, high frequency electromagnetical radiation will not be produced if
satisfactory insulation is guaranteed. Its electroagnetical environment impact is identical with common contact
system.
64. Generally speaking, electmpnetical environment impact of electrified railway appears :n following three
aspects:
I   The impact on TV receiving of nearby residents - this is the main and most practical electromagnetical
environment impact of electrification railway, and the impact is limited within 40m away from the outer rail.
II  The impact of intense electromagnetical field on people' s health - the impact is limited in the area below
contact system and the adjacent areas of high - tension power network of the traction substation. However,
electromagnetical field intensity of electrified railway radiation is much lower than the limit value of national
standard GB8702 - 88 " Electromagnetical Radiation Protection Stipulation", i. e. , the electmiagnetical field
intensity within each frequency scope is much lower than 12v/m(it is the lowest one of the limit value of field
intensity in each frequency range).
mI  The impact on nearby TV transposre stations - According to a lare amount of actual measumnents for the
existing electrified railway, the TV transposer stations over 80m far from the railway are basically free from the
impact, so the protection distance of impact on TV yoke station is 80 meters on VHF frequency range, whereas
the protection standard for the TV stations is higher, it will not at all be impacted.
65. It should be made clear that according to the regulations of the Ministry of Broadcasting and Television, TV
signal field intensity of VHF fiequency part should be more than 64dB(liv/m) in urban area and more than 57dB
(yv/m) in suburban area. According to lots of domestic and foreign research work, only when TV signal field
intensity reaches stipulated value and the signal - to - noise ratio is more than 35dB can residents watch TV
51



normally.
66. According to site investigation, TV transposer stations between Wuchang and Guangzhou are all more than
Ikm away from railway, TV station are more than 210rn away from railway, except Guangzhou TV Tower is
comparatively near, horizontally less than lOOm away from railway.
67. In order to know the present status of electromagnetical environment of Wuchang - Guangzhou existing
double - track lines, electromagnetical field intensity monitoring was carried out on northem ring line of
Wuchang, the main lines at the north and south of Changsha station, and in densely residential areas near
Zhuzhou, Hengyang, Leiyang, North Chenzhou, Chenzhou, Shaoguan, Xinjie, North Guangzhou and
Guanghou stations, the mnnitoring focuse on the signal field intensity of main TV channels, environmental radio
noise field intensity and the signal- to- noise ratio based on this. Table D - 3 - Table D - 5 sumuarize the
mnonitoring results.

68. According to Table D - 3 - Table D - 5, present status of electromagnetical environment along the line can be
concluded as follows:
I Among main station areas along the line, TV signal field intensities in Wuchang, Changsha, North
Guangzhou and Guangzhou station ar,eas basically meet the stipuluted level; in Zhuzhou, Hengyang, Leiyang and
Shaoguan station areas, channel signal field intensities transmitted fmm local TV stations can reach the standard;
while channel signal field intensities transmitted from TV stations in other places are a little lower. But in North
Chenzhou, Chenzhou and Xinjie station areas, all channel TV signals are lower, and cannot satisfy the
standard's requirement.
II In view of environiental radio noise field intensity, electronagnetical disturbance field intensities of non -
electrification sections of the Wuchang - Chenzhou -and Shaoguan - Guangzhou are usually lower than that of the
Chenzhou - Shaoguan electrification section, and the electromagnetical disturbance is even more intense in the
area near North Chenzhou electric locomotive turnaround depot. In Wuchang, Hengyang and Guangzhou station
areas, disturbance field intensities of some measured places are higher because these places are near main line
with heavy traffic and disturbed by motor vehicles. In Changsha area, some measured places have a little higher
disturbance because of nearby factories with electric welder and high - voltage switches.
ml  By judging TV signal - to - noise ratio in differect station areas, TV receiving conditions in areas in
Wuchang, Changsha, Zhuzhou, north Guangzhou and Guangzhou stations are beter; in Hengyang, Leiyang,
Shaoguan and Xinjie railway areas, some TV channel receiving conditions are good, while the ohters are not; in
North Chenzhou and Chenzhou stationa areas, TV signal field intensity is low, plus more intense disturbance, so
receiving conditions are bad.
D .3.4 Water environment
69. This evaluation gives mnonitoring and investigating results of present water quality and water amount of waste
water discharged from railway facilities, such as locomotive depots and locomotive turnaround depots, and of
receiving water involved in that project. Table D - (i shows water amount of waste water discharged, waste water
quality, waste water treatment procedure and practical discharge standard in each d'epot . The water source for the
water consumption of each production unit of the railway comes from the urban running water.

70. Data in Table D - 6 shows Railway waste water could be categorized as oil - contaminated water. Waste water
fiom Whchang South, Changha, Zhuzhou North, hengyangand Guangro lomcotive Depots ar.d from Wuchang
East, Hengyang North and Guangho North Locomotive Turnaround Depots is discharged after treated by existing
waste water treaument equipment, and if the equipment works normally, proessed water can meet the standard for
waste water discharing respectively. and Shaoguan Locomotive Depots does not have waste water treatnemt
equipment at present, and the oil cotent, COD and BOD5 in waste water are near to or in excess of the standard
(oil contemt < lmgIIl, bod5 < 60mg/I, cod < 130mg/i; roaste water from Yeuyang Locomotive Depot is teated
only by oil seperation tank, the content of oil, COD, BOD5 and SS in processed water are near to or in excess of
the standard(oil comtemt < lOmg/lBOD5 < 30mg/i, cod < 100mg/i); and it pollutes receiving water after
discharged. After the slndge from each station or depot' s senage treatment plant being trtated by the sludge
drying bed, the sludge shall be transported externally to the refuse transfer station or maek into bncds or burnt in
the sludge incinerator.
71. Table D -7 shows the current monitoring values,water system function, practical environmental standard of
the receiving water and railway pollution sources' impact and present condition of the water body.
72. Table D - 7 shows: in Wuchang East locomotive Turnaround Depot and in Guangzhou Locomotive Depot, the
monitoring value of COD, BOD5 and Oil in receiving water is near to or in excess of GB3838 - 88 DI water
quality standardcoil < 0. 05mg/, BOD5 < 4mg/I, cod < l5mg/l; in Zhuzhou North and Shaoguan Locomotive
Depots,and Hengyang North and Guangzhou North Locomotive Turnaround Depots, the monitoring value of COD,
BOD5 and Oil in receiving water is in excess of GB3838 - 88 V  water quality standard. Actually, the receiving
water is urban sewer in these areas. Water from the urban sewer can only be used for field irrigation . Waste water
from above rmentioned depots will not affect the function of receiving water, except treated waste water from
Shaoguan Locomotive Depots,which will increase pollution to receiving water. Waste water from Wuchang South
and Changsha Depots is discharged into urban sewer or drainage canal respectively.The waste water in different
depots meets required discharging standard after being treated without pollution to the receiving water. The
fanrnand will be polluted by the waste water spilling over the ditch fitm the Hengyang Loco, Depot when it is
rainning heavily. In Yueyang Lcomotive Depot, the content of COD, BOD5 and Oil in the receiving water is in
exess of GB3838 - 88 m water quality standard (oil < 0.05/BOD5 < 4mg/l, cod < 15rng/1), the receiving water
can not be used for agriculture, and the discharged waste water from Yueyang Icomotive Depot is one of the
rnajor reasons of its receiving water being in excess of the standard.
73. The current values of pollutant sources and receiving water quality were nmonitored at monitoring points within
the Wuhan Railway branch Administration, Changsha Railway branch Adminstration and Guangzhou Railway
Groupcompany. Monitoring analysis mnethods and monitoring results are shown in Table D - 8.

74. Heating system is unnecessary in winter along the Wuchang - Guangzhou, so there are few and less boilers
and boiler tonnage. Except the electrified Chenzhou - Shaoguan section, the whole line adopts diesel locomotives
with, only a few steam shunting locomotives in some stations.
75. Coal is the main goods transported on the Wuchang - Guangzhou Railway with the amount accounting for 20
- 40% of total freight transported on the line. According to the field monitoring on Daqin Railway, the amount of
coal dust arose during coal transportation is small when the distance is over 200 Iam, and since the coal train
always rans over 200km  away from original places on the line, dust produced dunng transportation is
comparatively snall on the line and its impact on atmospheric environment along the line is minor, but it is
known according to the actually measured result of Guangzhou - Zhuzhon Railway Line that the coal dust
produced by coal stores and special coal unloading lines causes certain impact on the surrounding environmnent.
Tht impact scope is 150m in the leeway direction in the case of no coal unloading operation;400m in the leenay
direction in the case of coal unloading operation.
Note: During the crude coal tanspot, the amount fo escape of coal dust produced at the first 200kmfom the
starting point is comaratively large The main reason is that neither cover is provided at the top of the coal nor
measure against the escape of the coal dust is taken. Therefore , the departments concerned are studying how to
control the scattering of the surface coal by the wind influence. = 76. Table D - 9 is a statistic result of fuel
consumption amount of moving sources (diesel and steam locomotives) and their emitting amount of main
atmospheric environmental pollutant in each sections on the Wuchang - Guangzhou line.

of CO befor the capacity epansion project. Since the atmospheric pollution soures are distributed along the
1081km long railway,their discharge densities are 13 .3Vkm-a of smoke,3. It/km-a of S02,7.7tVkma of No,
and 6.9 Vktn-a of CO respectively, causing slight impact on the environment. However, in Yueyang,Zhurhou,
Shaogun, Chenzhou and Hengyang district stations, atmospheric polltants such as smoke emitted by the
locomotives in service operation and some steam shunting locomotires with a comparively heavy impact on the
local atnospheric environment, become the main atmospheric pollution sources in the station area. The smoke
discharged by both heating boilers and industry boilers can meet the related standard of discharge, but the
emitting density of S02 exceeds the standard and has a certain impact on the local atmospheric envirnment.
||3D.3.6 Solid waste
80.The solid wastes produced by the existing Wuchang - Guangzhou Railway operation departents can be
categorized as follows:
T . Slags fiom steam locomotives, boilers in stations and depots, metal scrap fiom rolling stock maintenance and
11       ~~~repair.
II    estac refuse from statons and depots along the line .
5            m11. Reuse,exement and discarded fast food boxes fiom passenger uns.
8 1X.Table D- 12 Shows the statistics of the solid wastes volumes along the line.The total annual volume of solid
_            wastes discharged friom the Whchang - Guangzo Railway amounts to 28010.8 tons, including 47.8 % of slags,
34.0%  of domestic refuse and 17.8%  of the refuse from passenger trains,plus528.6 x 104 fast food boxes.
82. At prseent, more than 90%  slags fromn steam locomotives and boilers are collected and snpplied to local
cement plants and brickworks as raw materials and paving materials. lhrough investigation, there is almost no slag
|            accumulation in each discharge places along the line. Discharge anount of metal scrap generated from rolling
!            stock maintenance and repair is small and all of it is recycled by the recycle depatment.

83. Stations and depots along the line discharge a large amount of domestic refuse and the refuse has a complex
composition. As stations and depots are usually located in the vicinity of cities and towns, their refuse has already  l
been put into cities and towns reuse recycle and disposal systems. The block diagram of refuse disposal system at
main passenger stations along the line is as follow:                                                          j

84. According to the in - situ joint investigation along the whole line from Beijing to Guangzhou implemnented by
State BEP and MOR in April, 1998, stations and passenger trains have been properly furnished with refuse
collecting, cleaning and transferring equipment. Each car in every passenger train has its own bins or bags. In
addition, aU passenger trains downloads their refuse at designated stations along the line where specialized staffs
make the refuse colecting, cleaning and transferring standardizedly and regularly. As everything goes in order, the
phenomena of littering everywhere have been effectively controlled. MOR has promulgated some regulations to
eliminate diiposable undegradable plastic fast food box by using the degradable wrapping material as substitute.
Therefore, the"white pollution belt"along the line caused by the discarded fast food boxes has been effectively
contmoled. Other still - in - use plastic wrapping material for food is also effectively collected and the collected
plastic wrapping material will be retreated and used as the raw material for making wrapping material not for
food.

E. EIA Forecast
'1          86. The environmental impacts of the Wuchang - Guangzhou Railway Capacity Expansion Project cover two
stages - the construction impact and the operation impact. Dinang construction period, except the permanent
{ 1          changes caused to regional landform, vegetation and agiicultural ecology etc by land acquisition, relocation, soil
borrow and spoil as well as tunnel spoi storage, other environmental impacts will disappear as the construction is
i1           over.The environmental impacts during operation period will gradually become intense as the passenger and
freight traffic volume increase. Therefore, the ELA forecast will describe the impacts of the railway operation to the
.J|          sunnunding envirnent after its capacity expansion on the basis of the design terms 2000 and 2005. The issues
about land acquisition, relocation and resettlement as well as the induced econoric development along the line
I           due to the increase of passenger and freight traffic volume will also be described in the section of social and
cultural environmenl imracts.
E.1 IEhviroiental impcts duwng Consucion Period
87.1he construction period of the capacity expansion project is scheduled in three years(including construction
preparation), in which the key construction projects include the new building and rebuilding electrification
facilities such as traction substations,switching stations and sectioning stations etc. along the line; locomotive
and car facilities; extra - long bridges on Changsha passenger train untwining line and crossing Liuyang River and
rebuilding and expanding major stations and yards like South Wuchang, North Yueyang, East Changsha, Norht
Hengyang,Shaoguan and North Guangzhou etc. In view of construction volume, the construction work for the
Wuchang - Hengyang section is relatively arduous as compared with the Hengyang - Guangzhou section.
88. As meqtioned above, the construction work of the project will generate a series of environmental impacts along
the line.Analysis is detailed as follows:
E. 1.1 Construction impacts on the agricultural ecology environnent
E. 1.1.1 Land acquisition
89. In construction preparation activities such as opening up a construction site and constuction of its access,a
63



I
relatively large amount of land will be temporarily occupied along the line. Meanwhile, due to constuction work,
transportation machine rolling and people stepping etc, an extra amount of land will be easily occupied and
danaged AIl these factors will be liable to produce unfavorable impacts to the land resources along the line.
However, since this project will not involve new line construction, its construction quantities are relatively sall.
As the transportation and the tertiany industry along the line are well developed,the requirement to construction
access, workers' living camps and materials storage yard can mostly be satisfied through the existing facilities at
the local areas. On the whole, the unfavorable inpacts due to land occupation by the project are only limited to
local areas.
E 1. 1.2  Soil erosion due to soil borrow and spoil                                                           l
90. This capacity expansion project involves a cut - fill work totalling 657. 28 x 10'm3, which is not a big
amount compared with the line length and land coverage between Wuchang and Guangzhou. However, the whole      j
line has 20 soil borrow and spoil pits which are a relatively large. The soil borrow and spoil will bring about
different degrees of erosion and damages to local soil.The locations of major soil borrow and spoil pits along the  I
line and corresponding cut- fill works are listed in Table E- I.
91.In Table E- I,the soil borrow amount for the project is much bigger than the spoil amount. Along the line
there are 7 soil borrow pits with a soil borrow amount over 10 x 104m3 in which the one at Wangjiabao, located at
K1329 + 600, is the biggest. For the whole line, there are only two large - scale spoil pits and the largest one is
located at K1329. In Table E - I, most of the big soil borrow and spoil pits along the line are located at hilly and
gentle lands. Meanwhile, most of the lands occupied are forestry areas. Only eight soil borow pits, namely    I
Shengli Village(Kl234)Dongyangdu( K1762 + 750 and K1763 + 900), Leiyang( K1814 + 200), Maba( K2063 +
900),Shakou(K2097 + 100),Lianjiangkou(K2153 + 600) and Yuantang(K2199 + 700)occupy arable lands and
they all can be restored.

92  The soil erosion and damages generated by soil borrow and spoil are mainly the following two aspects.
.j]          I . A large scale soil borrow wllesult in heavy damages and distiance to the earth surface of the borow pits
and their smnundings, leading to damages and extinction of the vegetation, soil exposition, declining of mountain
body stability and soil anti- erosion capacity,and along the line,under the scouring of rich rainfall,the surface
65



rocks are liable to be broken and weathering, forming soil and water erosion.-
II Laxge amount of broken rocks and various impurities are ointained in the construction spoil, which is low both
in stability and anti - erosion capacity. f piled improperly, under suong scuriing of rainfaU in rain season, it is  f
easily denuded and collapsed, forming mud - rock flow and dirty muddy water, damaging nearby soil and farm
lands, and also bringing about pollution and damages to irrigation canals and ditches, rivers and ponds.       l
E .1. 1.3 Realignment impct on water and soil conservation
93. In the capacity expansion project, there will be 31 sections of tracks with total length of 75.991an in the
whole line whose alignments and longitudinal sections are designed to be changed.
Among these sections, there are six sections of 34. lkm tracks to be newly built, seven detouring sections of 20.
39km and eighteen sections of 21.5km tracks to be rebuilt. if no proper protection measures were taken in time,
the slopes' construction of either embankments or cuts in these sections should be liable to result in water and
soil erosion.
E.1.1.4  Construction impacts on agricultural crops and vegetation
94. Whether it is opening of construction site and access, the soil borrow and spoil, bridge and culvert
construction or tunnel construction, aU wiU bring about damages of different degrees to the crops and vegetation at
the construction sites and its nearby areas. Besides, a lot of dust caused by construction and transportation
activities covers the stems and leaves of the roadside crops and vegetation,which will affect their photosynthesis
arnd result in production decrease of the agricultural products and vegetation withering.
E1. 1.2  Construction impacts on urban ecological environment                                                  |
E. 1. 2. 1 Construction impacts on urban transportation
95. The construction impacts on part of urban transportation wiU last the whole construction period. They mainly
appear in the foUowing:
I  The land acquisition and relocation in the initial construction period will result in changes or blockade of  [
part routes at the relocation areas, thus affecting the transportation there.
II  In opening up construction sites and access as well as the construction of bridges and culverts, part of the  [
existing roads may be closed, resulting in trafflc problems at local areas.
HI  The transferring of construction equipment, materials and earth and stone works for cut - fill will last the
whole construction period, therefore, the roads near the construction sties in large and medium - sized cities will
become more congested due to many construction vehicles and construction machineries, which, within certain    L
period,will affect the road clearance.
E. 1.2.2  Construction impacts on urban landscape                                                              L
96. Construction work will bring about a series of unfavorable influences on uban landscapes, in which, the
following two points are the most prominent:                                                                   |
66

damage the exising urban landscapes in those areas, affecting its harmoizao and producing visual 
D Dust and waste water generated firm  onstruction wods will pollute urban roads and building, dam
affecting urban landscapes and sightseeing.
E. 1.3 Environmental impacts generated by construcfion noise and vibration
97. Construction machines and transport vehicles are the main noise and vibraon sources during the
construction period of this prject. It is uualy located at the central district of the construction site. Talbe E-
2 shows the intensity of the noise soumes of commonly used cstuction machines; the pile drivers and
j1           excavators listed in the table are also the prominent vibration sour, with the vertical Z vibration level at 30m
away fim the themselves being more dtan 80dB.

98. A large amount of analog investigations and monitoring show that the noise sensitive receivers as residential
areas, schools around the construction site are rarely distributed. By properly adjusting the locations of the high
o- nise producing construction machines, these noise sensitive receivers can be basically free from the noise
disturbance. Within the foreseeable scope, this project will not cause much impact to the existing noise sensitive
receivers during the construction period.
E. 1.4 Construction impacts on water environment
99 .The pollution to water environment from construction works appears in the following three aspects:
(1 )The sewage generated fruni workers' camps will pollute nearby water body; it is more prominent at rural areas
67



I
because of lack of perfect drainage-systems.  -
(2)The waste water produced by construction nachines, fuel leakage and waste oil discharge etc. may bring
about pollution to the water body near the construcitin sites.
(3) Because of soil borrow and spoil in bridge and culvert construction, water drainage of foundation pits and pile
foundation work etc may cause the increase of the silt content in irrigation canals and ditches, rivers and ponds
and the decrease of water quality. Such impact is of short duration and of limited extent and degree . At present,
there is no other better way to minimize the impact but only some protection measures may be adopted during
construction. The newly-built Liuyang River Large Bridge in the Wuchang - Hengyang section is a possible site
producing impact. The Liuyang River Iarge Bridge crosses Liuyang River about 280m - wide.
E . 1.5  Construction impacts on atmospheric environment
100.The construction impact on air environent mainly appear in dust pollution. From opening up construction    |
sites and access, soil borrow and spoil, material transportation to building construction, construction completion
and site clearing up etc. all will produce thick dust, resulting in pollution to local atmospheric environment
along the line.
E . 1.6  inpacts of construction solid waste on environmental
101.The solid waste from the construction activities and its environmental impacts can be summarized into two
categories:                                                                                                    J
I . living refuse by construction workers. This kind of refuse can be collected and disposed by environmental
sanitation departments in urban areas, while in mral areas, it may cause harms to soil, vegetation and water
environment.
Ll.Tunnel spoil and various kinds of construction refuses will be generated by construction works; the impacts of
tunnel spoil have been mentioned before; and various kinds of construction refuses will damage soil and vegetation
in rural areas and seriously affect environmental sanitation and landscapes in urban areas.
102. By analysis of the nature and contents of the project, the scopes and degrees of environmental influences
possibly generated from various construction activities are all minor compared with a new line construction.
Through cornprehensive comparisons along the environmental impacts listed above, it can be decided that the
most prominent environmental impact during construction period of the project" is the damages to soil and       l
vegetation due to land occupation and soil borrow/spoil activites, and the next is the influence of construction
noises and dust pollution. Other impacts from construction are relatively small.

103 . lhe environmental noise forecast is made on the basis of current monitoring data, passenger and freight train
pairs at each section in the design years, i.e.2000 and 2005 tonnage rating, train speed, operation natures and
variations of operation volume at each station and depot, incorporating monitoring data gained from similar lines,
stations and depots with the calculation ways of proportional forecasting method and model calculation method.
The values of environmental noise forecasting for main lines of each section and the main station areas 30 m away
from the outer rail of the line are listed in Table E- 3
104 After the electrification, the distabance of rail noise will increase and will be the major noise sourne
because the speed of the passenger and freight trains have been increased. But the impacts of locwMove
whistling are more prominent in the throat section of the stations. Within the design years, the pairs of passenger
trains will increase about 79% - 100%, the pairs of freight trains will decrease about 22% - 60%. It can be
seen fimm Table E-3 that the changes of Leq values of environmental noise on main lines of each sections and at
intennediate stations are -1.9 -1.4dBA in 2000 and- 1.5 -1.7dBA in 2005. The environmental noise along
the line will maintain the current status quo. Some sections will be somewhat better.

Note: 0  See also values of current environment noise shown in Table D- 1.
(t) The data reflect the max and mm values after a comprehensive statistics to the correspending indices of each
assessing point in a secdon.
105. Under the electrification project, building and expanding some departure yards and locomotive depots nake
the railway more adjacent to some sensitive points, bringing about an increase of railway noise impact. The
incrernents of Leq level in 2000 are between 0. 2 - 0. 5dBA and 0. 7 - 1. OdBA in 2005. At some sensitive
4 ~~points, such as dle Heng,yang no. 7 Raiway School, Shaoguan No. 2 ERailway School, Guangzhou No. 4
Railway School and Guangzhou No.2 Railway Middle school etc, the sound environment quality will be sonenhat
I            worse after the electrification.
*            The relationship between schools and the railway can be seen in Fig. E-1,Table E-2 and Table E-3.The change
of noise can be seen in Table E-4,Table E-5.
E.2.1.2  mitigation measures of noise prevention
106. Cities and towns along the railway line should scientificaly divide their functioning areas incorporating with
the cities'overall planning. Therefore, no more noise sensitive buildings as residential areas and schools etc.
should be built within lOOm on both sides of the railway line.
107. The train's engineer and crew should be strengthened in their environment consciousness, strictly abide by
technical nrles of homing and try their best to minimize the impacts of locomotive horning noise on sencitive
*            points.
1|8.Protective barriers to close the lines  should be installed to prevent the pedestrians from going thnngh the
level crossings at the sections where there are residential areas and schools near both sides of the Beijing-
Guangzhou trunk line in urban areas of Yueyang, Changsha and Zhuzhou so as to reduce locomotive whistling
and railway noise disturbance. Specific locations are shown in Table E - 6.
* The protective barriers are not intend for noise reduction directly. They are just for preventing to pedestrians
from going through the level crossing when the train is coming. In this manner, the locomotive whistlings can be
reduced, thus the noise disturbance is directly reduced. The protective barriers themselves are not noise
absorbersor noise screens.

109. Afforestation may be made along the line in a planned way if possible, especially at the newly constructed
railway living quarters and around the locomotive depots, afforestation zones may be set up with evergreen
arbors, shnibs and lawns combining together.
1 10 . Long welded steel rails can be adopted to reduce rail joints, thus decreasing noise by 2 - 10 dBA. Long
heavy welded steel rails are even more better than conventional rails to reduce noise, nearly by 8 - 10 dBA
lower,. lt is required that for the main double - track line section of lOkm long at Hengang Station, the main line
section between K1893 + 000 - K1906 + 000 at the North Chenzbou Station in 26 km long, the main line section
between K2130 + 000 - K2132 + 000 at the Yingde Station in 4 km long and the main line section on the south
of the Tangxi Station in 20 km long, totalling 60 km line should use long welded steel rails as part of the rail
replacement plan of the project. The 60 km long rails needs an investment of RMB900, 000 yuan counted on
74



adding RMIB 15,000 yunkm for the welded rail.
111 . The noise levd i the Hengyong No.7 Raihvay School, Shaoguan No.2 Railway School, Guangdo  No.4
Rai    School and Guangzhou No. 2 Middle School exceeds the standard 6.7 - 15. 6dBA during daytime,
comparing with the criteria of the category II area in CB3096 - 93 that is 6OdB(A). The schools'teaching will
be serously affected by railway noise. Ihe detailed analysis is as follows:
The Hengyang No.7 Railway School, lcated at the nofth end of the station, adjacewnt to the train crew district
Icootive depot and only a wall separating it from the lead track of the fill wagon yard, is mainly disLurbed by
the locomotive whisding noise, averagely more than 40 times of whistling observed in an hour with its level
exceeding 80 dBA. Additionally, there are operational noise of passenger and freight trains, idling Dois of the
moter of locmotives awaiting for service at the north thrat of the station and the minor noise fomn the wagon yard
to the north of the school.
II. The Shaoguan No.2 Railway School located on the west side of electric locomotive depot in the south end of
the station is disturbed by both the locomotive service and awaiting for service noise fiom the locomotive depot
and the train operation noise. The school classrooms are 50m away from the main up - line and perpendicular to
the railway. The noise of the school's sports - gmund 30m away fiom the outer rail is in excess of the standard
by 1.1 dBA and 0.9 dBA during daytime and night, correspondingly, there are excess noise by 7.9 dBA and
18.9 dBA exceedances for its teaching building causing serious distubance to teaching. Such a heavy impact
will be alleviated after the project, due to locomotive whistling noise reduction by a big nargin through the
change of locomotive routing. And the schools' teaching environment will be improved. It is periods. predicted
Leq value will decrease by 0.1 - 1.9 dBA.
i m. The Guagzhou No. 2 Railway Middle School and No. 4 Railway School are on the east side of main up -
line, with a wall separating them from the line. Monitoring points before the former's teaching building are 30 m
*           away from the railway and the noise observed is in excess of the standard by 4.1 dBA during daytime.
Monitoring points before the latter's teaching building are 60m away from the railway and the noise observed is
in excess of the standard by 13.8 dBA and 12.3 dBA during daytime and night. Loomotive whistling is the
main noise source for the No. 2 Middle School. Ihe No. 4 School is mainly distrbed by non- railway noise.
Even so, the railway whistling is the main noise impact, especially the noise impact frxn passenger and freight
trains on up - line which nm throtgh the Guangyuan Highway to the curve section with a small radius There are
low and aist - rule residential houses on both sides of the line and the curve seciton with the access of the
locomotive depots, causing frequent whistling. The whistling noise level at the No. 2 Railway Middle School's
monitoring point crosses levelly which is 30m far fmon the railway reaches 90 - lQ4dBA. After the
electrification, the noise in school will maintain the current stawus as the flow of the passenger and fieight tains
will be changed . The noise variations are - 0.7 - 0.2dBA in the year 2000 and - 0. 2 - O. 6OdBA in the
75



year2005. IV. The above analysis shows that the noise impact is .i major disturbance to the Hegang No. 7
Railway School, Shaoguan No. 2 Railway School, Guangzho No. 4 Railway School and Guang4ou No. 2
Railway Middle School. It is required that protection measures should be adopted for the above - mentioned
schools. In consideration of the schools'locations in densely - populated area, for convenience of railway staff's
children's going to schools and difficulties of the school's relocation, it is required to close corridor windows on
all floom of the school's teaching buildings and install ventilation facilties in classrooms. All these mitigation
measures will reduce railway noise by 15 - 20 dBA. The cost is estimated in Table E - 7.

112. Forecast results of vibration from the Wuhan - Guangzhou Railway are listed in Talbe E- 8. After the
capacity expansion project, the environmnental vibration value at a distance of 30m away from the outer rail of the
nmin line is less than the required value of 80 dB which is stipulated in GB - 100070"Environnental Vibration
Standard in Urban Areas". lhe Yellow Crane Tower, a reinforced concrete architecture, is an important
sightseeing point in Wuhan with its vibration values forecasted below 75dB in daytime and 72dB at night, which
are stipulat'd for the mixed areas and downtown areas in GB - 10070. Therefore, there will not be any harnful
effect on the sensitive areas mentioned above after the railway electrified. After the electrification prject, the
vibration value in fiont of the teaching building of the Yueyang Railway Kindergarten is forecasted to be 79.3dB,
conformig the standard of 80dB in GB - 10070" Envimnmental Vibration Standard in Urban Areas", but its once
vibration value will exceed the standard that defines the value not going beyond the limit of lOdB in daytime and
'3dB at night. So the railway vibration affects the teaching activities of the kindergarten to a certain extent.

According to the laterinvestigafions, the kierteii has been built in another place.
113- In the majo cities ilong the line, there are nmary seinsitive points including residential areas and other
sensitive buildings within 30m fiom the outer rail on each side of the line. The envizanmental vration value will
be in excess of the standard. The approaches to solve the problems are to use shock absopi  pads beneath
tracks in relevant sections or lay long welded rails of 60kg/m in order to alleviate the interference of the train
operation to the urban residents.
E.2.3   E:e        cenvironment
114. After the project, the environmental radio background noise at the major station areas along the line will
have to change much. The man sensitive points of electromagnetics are still residential areas with their
distibution and distances fimm the railway similar to those for the exisng line. The emphasis of the forecast of
electrnagnetic envirment impact is put on the interference to television receiving along the line and the affect
of stong electumagnetic fields on human health.
E.2.3.1  Impact on television receiving
115. Based on the monitoring results of the current electrmagnetic envirnment along the existing double tracks
and referring to the field intensity of electmmagnetic interference from the Chenzhou - Shaon electrified
section, and the electronagnetic interference merements and research achievements obtained from the
electrification projects of the Zhengzhou - Baoji, Zhzhou - Guiyang Xiangqian Line and the Beijing West
Station, the field intensity of radio noise and the signal - to - noise ratio of TV signal at each major station area
along the Wuchang - Guangzhou line have been worked out with related calculation method. The data is shown
in Table E - 9 and Table E - 10.
116. The forecast results in Tables E - 9 and E - 10 indicate that:

I. After the electrification project, the transient electmagnetic interference wilU increase while the electric
78



locomotives pass thiriugh residential areas alng the Wuchang - Guawu line. Especially the noise field
intensity in the station areas of Leiyang and Xinjie increases a lot. The intensity of el etic interferece
|:           in Chenzhou Nordt and C zhu statimon arns and Guangiou station area is even stonger.
II. The increase of ci a c interference leads to the transient singal - to - noise ratio of TV signal
decreasing in different degrees while electic locmotives pass dtrgih each station area along the line, averagely
7 - 9dB lower for each channel but not exceeding 14dB. The ratio decrease in Zhuzhou, Leiyang, Xinjie station
areas is prominent,but particularly in Zhuzhou station area is even more pruinent. According to the criteria,
only when the signal - to - noise mtio is larger than 35dB can a satisfactory TV receiving effect be achieved, so
the normal receiving of TV progmg   will not be influenced in Wuchang, Changha, Guangzhou North and
C!uanzo station areas when the electric locumotive pss  by. In Zhuzliou, Hengyang, Leiyang, Shaoguan
station areas, TV channels tLanitted by local TV stations can meet the receiving requirement, but receiving
*            situations in North Chenzhou and Chenzhou, Xinjie station area are relatively poor.
m . On the passenger and freght train flows being 71 - 94 pairs per day in 2000 and 84 - 104 in 2005 and
assumption of the average speed of the passenger and freight trains being 100 km/h and 70km/h respectively,
the interference time rate will be 1.9% - 2.4%  in 2000 and 2.2% - 2.7%  in 2005 when electric locomotives
pass thdugh a sensitive receiver. That means more than 97% of TV receiving time for residents along the line
will not be interfered by electric locomotives. The main reason of poor TV receiving condition in Chenzhou and
Xinjie should be attibuted to the lower field intensity of TV signal. As the public sharing antennas or cable TV
networks have been established or on - going in main station areas, after the electrification completion of the
whole line, the TV receiving along the line will have become CCTV receiving, therefore, no unfavourable
inflnence will be caused by the train operation.
E .2.3.2 Analysis of strong electromagnetic field impacts on human health
1 17. The impacts on human health generated by stronger electromagnetic field of electrified railway can be
concluded in two aspects: high - fiequency electunagnetic radiation and stronger electric field of industry
fiequency. A large amount of measurements and researches indicate that the high frequency electromagnetic
radiation generated by the electrified railway is equivalent to a broad bandwidth pulse electromagnetic wave with
its frequency between 0.1- IOO0MH, and the maximum radiation field intensity of each band not exceeding 0.
I V/m  (at 10m  frtom  the outer rail). According to GB8702 - 88 a Regulations of Protection against
Electrnragetic Radiation", the peak value of field intensity for each band of such kind of electrmagnetic wave
should be less than 1000 times of the radiation limit value for this band. The minimum limit value of field
intensity with frequency between 0. 1 - 1000MH is 12 V/m. That means as long as the sum of field field of
every frequency band for high - frequency electromagnetic radiation on the electrified railway is not nore than
12000 v/m, it will have no not obvious affect on human health. As a matter of fact, the sum of maximum field
79



inteDsities of every frequency band for high - fiequency electrmagnetic radiation is less than 91 v/m, far below
the limit of 12000 v/m, so its ifunce on human health is of negligible.
118. There has not been any definite criteria related to the impact fiom industry frequency (5OH)on human
health at present. According to rlated studies abroad, 5KV/m can be used as reference limit for human body to
be long time exposed. The high electnc field radiation of industry firequency produced by electrified railway
mainly arises fiom the catenary and tractive substations. By calculation with the catenary voltage at 27.5kv and
the height of the catenary net, the maximum field intensity endured by human body under the catenary and areas
adjacent to high voltage line of tractive substations is 1 .24kv/m, which is far less than 5kv/m. As a result, the
electrmagnetic field of industry frequency from electrified railway has no obvious impact on human body.
119. To sum up, when the electrified railway comes into operation, neither the high - frequency electromagnetic
radiation nor the stronger electric field of industry frequency will have distinct impact on human health. Transient
electomagnetic interference would be strengthened as electric locomotives pass through. As the interference time
rate is less than 3 % and the cable TV networks will have been set up in major station areas along the line within
the comning 2 years, the capacity expansion project will bring about no significant influence on TV receiving along
the railway line.
120. The traction power supply facilities in this project will all be equipped with perfect isolaing, lightning
guard and automatic cut - out apparatus to guarntee their located areas from dangers. The safety considerations
include:
I . A grid grounding conductor will be laid down beneath the surface under the highvoltage equipment to ensure
a good grounding.
I . An automatic cut - out system will low down the voltage instantaneously to the criteria acceptable for human
body while any trouble occurs in the system.
m . A lightning guard system consisting of steel lightning rods, zinc dioxide lightning shield and anti - lightning
ring could prevent or release any lightning shock and provide the operator and equipment with absolute safety.
IV. All security considerations are based on the protection of operators with larger safety margin. Since the
sensitive objects such as residential quarters along the line will all be out of the protection radius, the traction
power supply system in this project will certainly have no negative impact on the safety of their ambience.
E.2.4  Water envirorment
121. After the capacity expansion project, the locomotive depots and locomotive turn - around depots and wagon
washing points along the line will still be the rnajor pollution source of production waste water. Table E - 11
shows the discharge volume, the estimated water quality of the discharged waste water and the treatnt prcess
to be adopted. The standard of discharged water followed by different areas is the same as that listed in Table D
- 6. The newly built Duoluokou Wagon Train Washing Point will follow the Standard of GB8978 - 1996, Class 1
80



(oil < 10mg/l,BOD  < 30mg/l,COD < 100mg/1).
Table E- lI(attached)
122  From the data of the Table E - 7, it is easy to get the follown analysis conceming the discharged water
I .After the project is completed, the vonume of the waste water dischard fiom Wuchang South, Changha
Locomotive Depots and frm Wuhng East, Hengang North ILcomobive Tum - armmd Depots will have little
changee. However the quality of the dischaged water may be better since the change of locomotive type.
II .Yueyang, Zhuzhou and Hengyang Lcomotive Depots will discharge waste water of less volume and better
quality as a result of eliminating steam locomotive repair and using electric locomotives instead of using any
diesel locomotive. The Yueyang ILcomotive Depot will have a new waste water treatent plant, which makes the
discharged water satisfy the related standards.
M m. The former Guangrbou North Locomotive Turn - around Depot will be changed into electric locomotive depot,
and Guanrso Loomotive Depot will increase working load, with part of electric locomotives used instead of
diesel locomotives, from where more waste water will be dischrged, and the quality of the mixed waste water will
be kept almost unchanged. The existn facilities can make the waste water reach the related discharge standards.
IV .The vohane of the waste water discharged fiom Shaoguan lcomotive Depot will maintain the current state,
and the sewage water is not treated, so its quality is in unconformity with the related standard. After the project
completion, the oontent of COD, BOD5,oil and SS in the discharged water will be in unconfonnity with the related
standard. (The standard is oil < lOmg/l,BOD5 < 60mng/, COD < 130mg/1)
V . After the project, there will be a new Duoluokou Wagon Washing Point. According to the forct,the waste
water from the Wagon Washing Point may be able to meet the related discharge standard after treated by the
designed waste water treatment equipment. (The standrad is: oil < lOmg/, BOD5 < 30ng/l, COD < 100mg/1)
Table E - 12( attached)
I|            VI, After the sludge fium each sewage treatment plant being treated by the sludge drying bed,the sludge shall be
transported externally to the refuse transfer station or made into bricks or burnt in the sludge incinerator.
1¶            123  Table E - 12 shows the water quality estimated by using river - mixing model to forecast concentration
change of various pollutants in receiving water and water quality forecast analysis. The function of all receiving
water and their practical environmental standards are the same as that in Table D - 7. The newly Duoluokou
Wagon Washing Point will discharge its waste water into nearby irrigation ditch which follows m Type Water
Quality Standard of GB3838 - 88. (oil < 0.05mg/l, BOD5 < 4mg/1, COD < 15mg/1)
124 From the Tables of E - 1I and E - 12. the analysis oenceming the discharged water quality after the

I .The treated waste water discharged from Wuchang South, Hengyang and Changsha Lcomrotive Depots will not
worsen the pollution degree of the receiving sewage of the sewage ditch or municipal sewers and meet urban
sewage discharge requirements.
II Waste water from Duoluokou Wagon Washing Point, Zhuzhou North, Guangzhou and Guangzhou North
Locomotive Depots as well as Wuchang East and Hengyang North Locomotive Tum - around Depots will be
discharged into the nearby irigation ditches. The quality of waste water from Zhuzhou North, Guangzhou,
Guangzhou North Locomotive Depots and Wuchang East, Hengyang North Locomotive Tum - around Depots will
be better than the present one, which reduce pollution to the receiving water. The waste water from Yueyang
Locomotive Depot will reduce pollution degree to Maojia Weir to meet the practiced standard. The waste water
from Duoluokou Wagon Washing point will not increase the pollution degree to receiving water because its quality
meets the related standard and its quantity is little.
m .Waste water from Shaoguan Locmotive Depot will be out of its related standard for its discharging without
treatment. The evaluation proposes to build a waste water treatment plant, such as oil isolation tank and gas
floating tank, to make it satisfy the function of receiving water.

E.2.5 Atmospheric Environment
125. When the Wuhan - Guangzhou capacity expansion project is completed, the coal and diesel oil
consumption and the discharge amount of air pollutants will be decreased considerably because of the substitution
of electric locomotives and diesel shunters for diesel locomotives and steam shunters.
126. Tables of E - 13 and E - 14 are statistics of fuel consumption and emission amount of pollutants from
moving pollution source (diesel shunter) and the fixed pollution sources (Production and domestic boilers).

127. Table E - 15 is the statistics of new boilers and emission volume of atmospheric pollutants. From the table,
it is known that seven new boilers are added after the project with 7.3 t/h of total evaporation capacity, 3348.
8 tons of annual coal consumption. The main pollutant emissionis 7.8 t/a of emission volume is smoke and dust.
Other main atmspheric poUutants include S02 of 39.0 t/a, NOX of 34.6 t/a and CO of175. 5 t/a. The cleaning
rate of dust and S02 shown in the table is the lowest rate required by the standard.

129. It is known from the Table E - 16 that the fuel consumption will be reduced significantly. The coal
consumed annually will be reduced by 42. 4%  andthe diesel oil by 92. 0%. As a result, there will be a
remarkable reduction of major pollutants discharged into atmosphere, with smoke & dust decreasing by 93.6%,
S°2 by 67.2%, NO, by 85.8%  and CO by 56.9%  respectively, which will greatly improve the atmospheric
environment along the line. In this project, there is only the new boiler with an evaporation capacity of 4t/hr. to
be installed in Jiangan West Loco. Depot and all the boilers in Wuhan Terminal will be fed with coal of low
sulphur content (0. 7%) . Even if no surphur removal device is attached to the boilers, the emitting
concentration of SO2 should be lower than the related standard. Althongh the newly installed boilers in
Changsha, Zhuzhou, Hengyang have their individual evaporation capacity lower than 4t/hr, if no sulphur
removal device is to be provided because of the poor coal, the concentration of SO2 will exceed the criteria,
causing certain pollution to the atmospheric environment. So these new boilers will be attached with a smoke
purifier whose effectiveness of desulfurization should be equal to or higher than 29% - 47%  in order to ensure
the emitting concentration of atmospheric pollutants from the boilers satisfying the standard of type II in
GB 13271 -91, i. e. concentration of smoke and dust being 250mg/Nm3 and that of SO2 being 1200mg/Nm3.
130. In order to guarantee that SO discharge meets the standard, a desulfilrization device is to be provided next
to the dust remover according to the local requirement. The cost will be included in the total cost of the boiler
room.

133. It is shown in Table E - 17 that the estimated output of the solid wastes after the project will be 29213.2
tons annually, a 4.3% increase as compared with that of the existing shown in the Table E - 17. The total
discharge of the solid wastes after the Capacity Expansion Project in 2005 has a 4.3% increaes comparad with
that before the project. The train refuise will be 6202.3 tons, the number of disposable fast food box will be 6.
56 mnillion pieces per year, all increased by 24.2%. The domestic refuse from the stations and depots will be
13497.4 tons, increased by 41.6%. All these indicate that the discharge of the solid wastes will increase with
the increase of passenger and goods traffic volume. All these will definitely cause more severe pollution to rajor
stations and the surroundings of Wuchang, Yueyang, Changsha, Zhuzhou, Hengyang, Chenzhou, Shaoguan and
90



Guangzhou. So management shau be strenghened for these station areas to further improve the cleaness and
storage of the solid wastes, unloading the train garbage at the assigned spot.
134. The utilization rate of slags from boilers and metal scraps is 90% and 100% respectively. 'The domestic
refuse discharged from all the stations and depots are collected by the city enviromnmental sanitary deparmennts,
causing no impacts to the surioundings.
135. After the project conpletion, excrement discharged fmm passenger trains will increase as the passenger flow
increase, generating unfavourable impact to the railway and train sanitary condition. while imprving travelling
condition and raising train speed, MoR is planning to gradually eliminate the old straigh - thugh - to - track
toilets on trains by new close toilets.
136.According to MOR TYH No.106(1996) Document, Notice on Announcing the Refuse Unload Refuse
Station of the Through Passenger Trains, the refuse discharge stations of Wuchang, Yueyang, Changsha,
Zhuzhou, Hengyang, Chenzhou, Shaoguan and Guangzhou and other larger passenger stations have already been
allocated with the devices for cleaning, collecting and storing passenger refuse. It is predicted that above devices
will meet the further need of refuse discharged. It will be unnessary to increase refuse transport facilities.
137. Refuse handling of all stations is shown in the block diagram Fig E - 1. 'The stations mainly handle the
trains refuse and domestic refuse from railway stations. All the refuse are required to have a classified treatment
in four categories(including paper, bamboo and wood; fruit shell and foodstuffs; Plastics and glass and metal)
with refuse box(bag)provided respectively for the train and stations. The refuse will be collected by special staff
fron the train refuse stations. ITrough simple dispose, it will be transported by the urban environmental sanitary
department.

138.Among the eight main cities along the line where the designated refuse unload stations for the passenger
train have been established, Wuchang and Guangzhou both have a larger population and also a larger volume of
refuse (up .to 210 x 104 - 250 x 104t/a); whereas Chenzhou and Shaouan hawe smaller population, and the
volume of refuse is corresonding by smaller(only about 26 x 104v'a); other cities like Yueyang, Changsha,
Zhuzhou and Hengyang are of medium scale and their refuse volume varies between 31 x 104 -72 x 104't/a.
Investigations to the cities'related departments show that most refuse is collected and buried. Some cities have
91



seperated and classified the refuse, recycling the useful part and mnaking nmanure from the organic substance.
However, generally speaking, hannless disposal of the refuse is low . According to the estimate above, the total
volwme of the refuse from the whole line in the year(2005) would be only 1.97 x l04t/a, being a smaller volume
compared with that of the eight cities. So the discharge of the railway refuse will not exert distinct pressure on
the urban departnent in charge of the refrse treatrent.
E.3 Socio- Cultural Environmental Impact
E. 3. 1.1  Scope, volume and awangement principles of land acquisition, relocation and resettlement
139.The land acquisition for the project will mainly take place in the realignment of some sections as well as
expansion or rebuilding of certain stations, substations and power supply depots. The whole project needs to
acquire 154.4 hectare of land, remove houses of 171955m2 and resettle 8668 residents. Table E - 18 shows the
quantity of the land acquisition, relocation and resettlement.

140. The scope of the land acquisition, relocation and resettlement related to the project is classified into 2
types. The one involves some individual large cities, medium and small towns (counties); the other involves
rural areas. The forier includes buildings for production and operation of railways or non - railways, dom-itories
for staff and dwelling house for urban residents,etc. It cocupies about 5 % of the total. The later includes farm
land, farmer's houses, somne mountain forest and uncultivated lands. It is about 95% of the total. A large
amount of land acquisition and relocation are involved in these areas.
E.3.1.2 Policies, laws and regulations about land acquisition relocation and resettlement
141. land-acquisition, relocation and resettlement related to the national construction are very complicated
system engineering of the sociaty. In order to avoid negative effects during the implementation of the project, all
mattezs related to land acquisition, relocation and resettlement shall be settled based on related national and
regional policies, laws, and regulations.
142. "PRC Land Admninistration Law", "Urban Houses Relocation Regulation" issued by the State Council,
92



b"mplementation Method of Land Administration of Hubei Province"," Detailed Rules and Regulations of Land
Administrion of Hunan Province", "Detailed Rules and Regulations of Land Administration of Guangdong
Province" and stipulations of land compensation worked out by different regions, cities and counties based on
above mentioned laws and regulatons will consttute basis of policy and law of land acquisition, relocation and
resettlement on the Wuhan - Guangahou Line.
E.3.1.3 General principles and target of land acquisition, relocation and resettlement
143. Te general principles to be followed are as follows:
I . Under the prerequisite of no influencing the construction quality, the scale of land acquisition relocation and
residents resettlement will be minimized, and the railway reserved land will be used to the maximum extent.
n . Efforts shall be made in land acquisition to avoid occupation of cultivated land and urban.
m. If reloation and resettlement is unavoidable, it is necessary to make sure that the unit to be moved
unwillingly will have a production and operation condition not lower than the before moving, the unwillingly
moved and resettled residents will have a livelihood not lower than that before the moving.
1V. The implementation of compensation to unwillingly - moved untis and residents should strictly abide by
related regulations and policies and pay compensation in tirme.
V. Viewing that the Wuhan - Guangzhou Line rnms through Hubei, Hunan and Guangdong Provinces where
there are differences in economic development, the work of land acquisition, relocation and resettlement should
be carried out under the prerequisite of giving a full consideration to local condition and socio - economic
development level.
VI. The problems arising from land acquisition, relocation and resettlement should be solved appropriately and
timely in the light of related regulations and policies. No future trouble shall be left.
144. The target- of the resettlernent of the project: For city and town areas, the resettlement will be combined
with the developrnrtt plan of the city and town, and the general planning of old city reconstruction, so as not
only to guarantee the resettlement condition of the production and operation units and residents not inferior to the
original level, but also to make the overall city construction layout rnore reasonable, favouring local economic
development and urban area construction. For fanning residents, resetdtement will favour local economic
development and ensure the affected farm residents' incmne and housing condition not inferior to oiginal level.
The way to realize the targets is to open up wasteland under the support of local governments, establish rural
enterprise-and make part of farming residents transferred to non - fanning residents engaging in construction of
local industry and the third industry (including railway).

acquisition, providing subsidies to the disables.
II .Young crops compensation and profitable land (other than fanning land)compensation should be paid to the
affected party. And the compensation should be paid directly to the affected party right at the time of land
acquisition.
m . Damages of private wells, tombs, walls, overland routes and other unmovable properties due to land
acquisition and relocation should be compensated according to the value determined by the local government. The
compensation should be paid directly to the individuals.
IV . Private house demolished should be compensated according to the local compensation standard. The unit
occupied the land should provide a piece of land for house building in accordance with the compensation
standard, and pay compensation for relocation.
147.The total cost of land acquistion,relocation and resettlemtn is RMB194.36 million yuan. The cost is shown
in Table E - 20

E.3. 1.5  Institutional franework of land acquisition, relocation and resettlement
148. Relocation and resettlement of railway unit and railway staff and workers involved in the project should be
adjusted and solved by the railway department itself. Construction units, land administration deparument of local
government and the units and individuals to be relocated will jointly settle the affairs of compensation to the
affected units and individuals in accordance with regulations of land acquisition and compensation set by the state
and local govemments.
149. The above mentioned two cases only account for about 5% of total volume of land acqusition and relocation.
The large amount is the farm land acquisition and relocation of farmers' houses. The later case accounts for about
95%  of total volume of land acquisition and relocation. The railway departnent consulted with local govemments
for many times and decided to adopt the following ways to handle the problems.
I.The railway construction unit (Railway Construciton Headquarter) defines the area of land acquisition
according to construction drawing, then entrusts the local state land administration departnent with the land
acquisition, and pays the entrusted party for land acquisition compensation( including cost of land compensation,
relocation, labour resettlement, young crps and cost of registration of changing from farming residents to non -
fanning resident. etc).
II .Entrusted by the railway, the local state land department signs a land acquisition contract with the village
management committee, according to related regulations issued by the State and the local govemment and pays for
the land acquisition.
m . Township and village management commnittee will implement the resettlement including resettling of unwilling
residenr in the light of related rules. Local state land department will be responsible for instructing and
supervising the use of compensation to ensuring that the compensation is really used in developing rural economy
and imprnving livelihood of those unwilling residents so that their living condition is at least not lower than the
origial.

E. 3. 1.6 Resettlement of labor force on the land acquired
151. Measures of resettlement:
I According to related national and local regulations and laws of land, some the farming population have to be
transferred to non - fauming population, with their jobs changed.
II- Railways employ soae contracted workers among farmers on the acquired land to meet the needs of railway
operaiion.
m .Township enterprises will be established to employ farrers on the acquired land and make farmers leave the
land but not leave their hometown. Since in China, land resures are national, therefore, the compensation to
land acquisition is not paid to the fanners, but paid to township and village govemrment and the grass - roots
governmet for developing township enterprises , providing more job opportunities to the people.
IV . Readjusting of land allocation
152. Ater resettlement, the farmers no longer engage in fanning simply. Ihe point is that whether the income of
resettled farmers is less than that before or not. According to the statistic yearblLks of Hubei, Hunan and
Guangdong Provinces, 1996 statistic data of the countryside economic benefit in three provinces are obtained.
And it is shown in Table E - 21. From Table E - 21, it can be seen that the countryside labour force can create
more output value when it is engaged in industry, building, transportation, business or catering trade than in
agriculture only. This shows that all properly resettled famrs will have more income and better livelihood in
varied degrees.
Table E - 21
Countryside Economic Benefit in ffte provinces along the line (1996) (Yuan/person)
Items                              Hubei Province    Hunan Province  Guangdong province
Total output value of countryside society     22246             20908              26131
Agricultural total output value                6363              5869              6191

value
Note: data listed are average output value per person in all sectors.
97



153. AU mentioned above is favourable factors of the resettlement.1There are also some unfavorable ones in the
resetdtement. buch as people' s qualification. The youngers are easier to be resettled than the elders; the
educated easier than the illiterate or the half - illiterate, and so on. Therefore the mnatter of resettlement is an
arduous and painstaking work. It should be handled very cautiously and carefully. Proper resettlemen shall be
done according to the person's condtion. After the completion of the resettlement, necessary job training should
be given to the resettled people so that they can soon adapt to new jobs.
154. The matter of land acquisition, relocation and resettlement related to the construciton of tractive substations,
sectioning stations and switching stations has been brought into the project as a whole. In most cases, these
substations are located far away from cities, and they are very flexible in location selection to avoid residential
area to mnmimize relocation and resettlement. Also, these substations only only occupy small pieces of land .
Therefore, the matter of land acquisition, relocation and resettlementrelated will not cause major environmental  l
impact.
155. In short, the Wuhan - Guangzhou Line Capacity Expansion Project is different fiora constructing a new
line. It does not need much land acquisition, relocationand resetdtement. Only part of communities are affected.
The project will promote economic development and improve livelihood of the people in the affected areas along
the line.
E.3.2  Construction impact to local business and employment
156. Sand and stone material, limne stone arnd brick needed for the construction will be locally supplied. The
construction workers will buy food and daily necessities in local areas.Therefore,there will be more business and
emnployment opportunities. But these kinds of opportunities has only has a short duration. It will disappear when
the construction is over.
E.3.3  Induced development
157. According to the statistic data of Hubei, Hunan and Guangdong provinces alongthe line, the average annual  i
growth rates of total product value of society were 13.0%, 11.0%and 17.7%respectively from 1990 to 1996;
average annual growth rates of total product value of industry were23. 1% ,20. 2%  and 30. 0% respectively,
while the average annual growth rates of passenger and freight turnover were 3.2% ,5.4% ,5.5% respectively at
the same period. It shows that provinces along the line had a rapid development in economy, while the freight
turnover increased slowly. Analysis of all the restraining conditions of economy development in recent years im
three provinces and the estimation on related information have shown that, if it is to guarantee the rapid
development of economy, the growth rates of transportation must be higher than that of economy. Because the
rpid economic development enlarges the requirement of transportation of people and goods, the neck of
transportation more and more restrains further economic development . According to the construction design, the
Wuchang - Guangzhou line will coordinate with the Beijing - kowloon line, with passenger traffic as the main
98



business and the freight traffic considered. The implementation of the project will give great impetus to promoting
the economic development and offering more employment opportunties; meanwhile, it indicates provinces along the
line after thelproject will expand or build a large number of industrial enterprses and related service facilities,
which Will inerease the impact to local environmental quality.
158. According to the data of design, the passenger traffic volume will increase about1O,000 people every day in
the year 2000,and about 21200 people every day in the year 2005, by a comparison of this project executed or
not executed-.t will promote interfQow of people, development of travel service, and a prosperous business and
market. Meamphile, major stations and its nearby areas will develop into prospeus metropolises and cities.
Especially, tle medium and small stations such as Puqi, Yueyang, Miluo, Pingshi, Xingjie (now called Huadu)
will develop-nre rapidly. The development of the scale of the station areas and the nearby business services and
traffic facilities of various types will both make these areas prosperous and aggravate the environmental burden,
especially the acoustic environment quality will drop, the atmospheric pollution will become aggravated due to the
tail - gas enission of the motor vehicles. It is expected that the ambient noise of most large and medium station
areas and the nearby business districts will exceed the limit values for Type II Area stipulated in GB3096 - 96
(60dBA for the day and 50 dBA for the night) . The degree of atmospheric pollution is obviously higher than the
average level of the city it is located at.
159.To sum up, the Wuhan - Guangzhou Railway Project is a great drive to economy development in the
provinces along the line and brings a large increase of job opportunity,but it also makes more serious impacts to
the environment. Provinces concerned should strictly implement environmental protection regulations issued by the
State, make a good regional planning of cities and towns through the way combining prevention and rectification
and contrl the environmental impact induced by economic development.
E .3.4   Gltural properties

E.3.5 Environmental economic gain and loss analysis
176. After the implementation of the Pioject, the transportation capacity of the existing line will be increased
greatly. It will ease the tension of the passenger and feight tansportation in the area along the line and
Cuangdong Province, therefore, it will have significant social and economic benefits. Meanwhile, the project will
also bring a positive and unfavorable influences to the environment of areas along the line. Here is the brief
analysis of environmental economic gains and losses after the completion of the Project, lhe analysis is based on.
the income and cost designed the year 2000 and the year 2005 on the line

hniect benefit
180.Social benefit of national economy growth: social benefit to the national economy provided by the railway
freight traffic is main benefit of the Railway. According to the statistics, unit tumover social benefit of the railway
is RMB750 Yuan/ten thousand ton - kn. It can be calaculated that the project wiU provide a national economic
growth of RMB24127.4 ten thousand/year in the year 2000 and RMB53116.3 ten thousond/year in the year
2005.
181. Benefit resulted from the saving of trave by I hours. After the Project, the traveling speed of passenger train
will increase, and the travelling hours will be decreased accordingly. It is estimated that, if the average travelling
time of a passenger shortened by 1 hour, every worker creates an average national income of RMB3/hour in the
year 2000,4/hour in the year 2005. and suppose the traveUing hbors for business accounts for 20% of total
travelling time, then the social benefit resulted frim the saving of traveUing hours will be RMB59.85 million/year
in 2000 and RMB94.85 milion/year in 2005.
182. The benefit gained from decreasing the time of freight traffic. After completion of the project, the
transportation speed of goods will be increased and the on - rail transit tire and turnover time of cunrent funds
103



for goods will also be shortened.lt is estimated that,if on- rail transit time shortened by I hour,the price of on
- rail transit goods is R11B1500 yuan/ton and interest rate of current funds for goods is 10% ,the social benefit
resulted from time - saving transportation is RMB3. 056 minlion yuan/year in 2000 future and RMB3. 385
million/year in 2005.
11. Lose
183.Agricultural Loss: The Project's land acquisition is 154.4 hectare of lands including 70% of cultivated land
and fann land, totalling 108. 1 hectare. According to 1996 statistic year book of Hubei, Hunan and Guangdong
Prvince, the average output value of cultivated and fann land is RMB39270 yuan/ha, the average annual growth
rate of agricultural output value is 64% ,then the agricultural loss is estimated at RMB4.244 million yuan/year
in 2000 and RMB5.772 million/year in 2005.
184. Investment of construction infrastructure, At present, the evaluation of economic loss of railway infrastrtureul
construction takes yearly incremnent of infastructure construction as an economic loss. With a calaculation period
of 30 years, it is inferred that the total sum of principal and interest of the investment of the Project is
RMB18974.46 million yuan;the construction investment every year is RMB632.482 million.
185. Operation cost of environmental protection facilities. Investment of environmental protection facilities is
shown in Table E - 25. Operation cost of environmental protection facilities is about R1MB950. 000 yuan/year,
including R1MB300, 000400, 000 yuan for manaemnt, RMB80, 000 - 100, 000 yuan/year for training
professional perosn, RMBI00,000 for monitoring and RMB350,000400,000 for training environmental protection
personnel for 5 yeans as a conversion period, with an average of RMB70,000 - 80,000 for each year.

E.3.5.2 Analysis of environmental benefit
187  After the project, adoption of electric locmotives instead of diesel locomotives will greatly reduce gas
discharge from locomotives. Locomotive fuel consmmption and pollutant discharge are shown in Table E - 27
Table E- 27              Fuel Consumption and Pollutant Diharging

Year 2005        28209           428.7            90.2          536.70           200.3
reduction(%) I     92.0            92.0            92.0            92.0            92.0
188. From Table E - 21, locomotive fuel consumption and pollutant discharge will decrease by 92%. The
pollution to atmospheric environment will have a signification drop after the project. After completion of the
project, quality and volumne of waste water will have not much change. Treated waste water will not cause
significant effect on receiving water.
189. After the completion of the project ,due to the increase of train operation speed and the tonnage rating, the
pollution of train operation noise and vibration will increase; and electromagnetic radiation will also increase due
105



to operation of electric locomotives, lifting - lowering operation of pantograph at loco servicing depot, operation of -
traction transfonner station and traction power sectioning station, affecting residents nearby in TV Watching. Land
acquisition and relocation will also have affects on ecological envimrnment and living circumstance of the
residents. The increase of passenger traffic, passenger train refuse fium stations and along the line will also
increase sinficantly. But, proper disposal can minimize the above mentioned unfavorable influence to the
environment along the line.
190.Based on the analysis of the economic, social and environmental benefit, it is evident that the project will
have a significant environmental economic benefit. The project will not only bring about enormous national
economic and social benefit, but also play a positive role in improving atnospheric environment quality along the
line.
F. Review of Alternative Scheme
191. The Beijing - Guangzhou Railway Line is an important north - south corridor of Chinese Railway network.
The Wuhan - Guangzhou Railway is the south section of the Beijing - Guangzhou Line. The Wuhan - Hengyang   I
section was double tracked in 1970s. The double - track railway proiect of the Hengyang - Guangzhou section
was open to the traffic in 1988. Since the Wuhan - Guanghou track doubling, its transportation capacity
gradually saturated and it is incapable to meet the growing needs. For expanding railway transportation capacity of
the section, it is recommended to build a third line or electifying the existing line. As the Wuhan - Guangzhou  i
line mns through a large area with flourishing economy and a dense population, buliding the third line will
occupy a lot of land and result in a large amount of relocation and resettlement. Its construction volumne and cost
will greatly exceed that of the electrification scheme. From the view point of environmental protection,
electrification scheme is superior to adding the third line. Especially the unfavourable impact of the former to
ecological, atmospheric and water environment is much less than the later. It can be concluded that the
electrification project not only meets the needs of capacity expansion, but also favourate environment protection
along the line.
192. There are not many design alternatives for the electrification project. Only local optimization is mnade. The
optimization related to environmental proteciton includes the following items:
F. I  Altemtive Schaem for Subgrade
193. Due to various reasons, in the Wuhan - Guangzhou line' s double - track reconstruction, the roadbed
reconstruction for the flooded sections was not implemented. The electrification project will rebuild the roadbed
106



lower than the design water level in combination with raising the bridge. Trees will be planted at the edge of the
roadbed, and turf will be planted at the slopes or protective works shall be added to prevent flood erosion. In
consideration of minimizing land acquisition and reducing construction volume and investment, the design adopts
the schemne of raising the existing line instead of building a new one.
F.2 Optimization of Station Facilities
194. As the cities along the line develops, the locations of some stations can not meet the demands of the
developrnent. For example, The Miluo Station is located at the east side of the line, but Miluo develops its
downtown in the west side of the line. Therefore, the Location of the station at present has arised unfavorable
impact to local communication, public facilities and econoomic grwth. This project gives a full consideration to
this reasonable requirement and move the station from the east side of the line to the west side. ht will play a
positive role in promoting cormunication and economy of the city.
F .3  Optimzatin of Tral ve Power Supply and Substation Facilites
F. 3. 1  Expansion optimzation of power supply depots
195. The project will expand the Hengyang and Guangzhou power supply depots which can be carried out at
original sites or new Sites. In consideration of difficult land acquisition and relocation for the original Guangzhou
Power Supply Depot and a series of unfavourable socio - ecological impacts for expansion the original site, the
scheme comparision results in building a branch of the depot at the north hub of the Tangxi Station. The scheme
will build catenary section, foreman's section and power supply depot together in one place which has a smooth
and spacious terrain, less relocation,convenient highway and sidings leading - in and less investnnt,Therefore
the scheme will have a good socio - economic environmental benefit. Here is another different example, the
Hengyang Power Supply depot has an ample space and reserves the expansion condition during the Hengyang -
Guanghou double track construction. So the expansion is carried on the former Hengyang Power Supply
Administration, avoiding land acquisition and relocation and minimizing investment and unfavorable social
envirnmemental impact.
F.3.2 Location optimization of tractive substations and other tractive power supply facilities.
196. Location selection of tractive substations, sectioning stations, switching stations and catenary section along
the Wuhan - Guanghou Line gives a full consideration not only to guarranteeing tractive power supply,
convenient maintainence and management and staff' s livelihood, but also to occupying less land especially
farmland and being far away from the residential quarters and chemical works as far as possible, Ihe design
modifies locations of these tractive power supply facilities many times. Such efforts will miniize the unfavourable
107



ecological impacts and electromagnetic environ ental impacts that possibly generated after the line goes into
operation.
G. Mtigation Measure Plan
197. In order to minimnize environmental impact of the project, the following environmental protection measures
are worked out on the basis of the line' s envirornental background and analysis results of construction
environmental impacts.
G. I  Measures of Environmental Protcton during Contrwcton Period
198. The construct should make use of the existing access and living facilities to minimize temporary construction
land occupation , especially the agricultural land. Some temporary construction sites should be free from waste
and become farmland in time after construction.
199. Earth and stone work excavation construction should be conducted by section for sectioning protection in
time.E-xcavating, transporting, filling and leveling as weU as ramming should be carried out one after another
without loose soil left to prevent soil and water erosion. For the paddy field and other farmland to be occupied for
borrow- pit of subgrade and station, the surface humus soil in the fields should be moved before borrowing to
other place for soil protection.
200. Measures should be taken for borrow pit along the line to protect soil and vegetation. Surface humus soil on
the pits should -be moved away for other use. After ocnstruction, the pit must be sodded, or laid with dry rubble
for protection.The borrow pits in hilly and mountainous areas can be levelled for farmland and paddy fields can
be levelled for water - storage and fish ponds after constrction. Table G - I summarizes the suggested protection
measures and corresponding cost for all borrow pits along the line. All these protection restoration measures for
the whole line's borrow pits need an investment of RMBI. 105 milion yuan. If all these measures shown in Table
G - I are implemented, the unfavourable impacts from these borrow pits will be effectively controlled. It is
predicted that no visible change will be brought to the ecological environment along the line.
201. In order to alleviate the burden produced by the construction to local traffic, construct should try to avoid
changing and closing the road and avoid traffic peak hours for construction and transportation.
202. lt is to adopt a closed management to construction sites and other temporary construction sites. Constructor
should conduct civilized construction to avoid a large destroy of landscape.
203. In the bridge and culvert construction, it should be properly aranged for disposing spoil and residue in their
transshipment and piling so as to prevent water and soil pollution. It is to set up a steel or earth weir in the
108



vicinity of bridge piling foundation during the construction of the extra - long large bridge to prevent silt and
other pollutants generated by construction from polluting ambient water body. Besides these, during the
construction of pedestrian culvert and agricultural irrigation ditches,consideration for interim messures including
temporary access and temporary water pipes shall be considered to ensue the communication and agricatural
Yingatimu of the costucdt  site free frmm large interference.
204. Selection of construction site should abide by the stipulations of GB1253 - 90"The Noise limit of
Construction Site" and set the high noise equipment, far from noise sensitive points including schools and
residential quarters.Night construction should be avoided to reduce noise at night.
205. The constructor should try to reduce dust. If possible, some construction sites shall spray water to reduce
dust.
206. Constructor and construction supervisor should appoint full - time or part - time persons to conduct
environmental protecton or take charge of envirnmental management and supervision in the course of
construction. Meanwhile the constructor should improve stuff's envrionmental consciousness and make related
regulations so as to properly dispose construction waste water, refise and living garbage. Waste water from
different sources should be discharged centralizedly and the refuse should be cleared away at any time.

overall planning. New noise sensitive buildings such as schools and residential quarters should no longer be built
within 100 meters on both sides of railway.
208. It is to strengthen the environmental protection consciousness of the locorotive drivers and crews. Whistling
shall be strictly in line with the technical regulations to reduce noise impact on noise sensitive buildings as less
as possible. Low noise and high orientation air whistle should be equipped when it is available to reduce whistle
noise.
209.It is to set up barriers to close the lines in the areas where there there are schools and residential quarters
including Yueyang Village, Yueyang Railway Dormitory in Yueyang city. The railway dormitories along the two
sides of the line, Shizi Village in Changsha,Shangyuetong Residcntial Quarter, Shifu Road Residential Quarter,
Jianning New Village and Dachongkou Residential Quarter in Zhuzhou, totalling 6.7km long section to ruduce
the locomotive whistde noise.The measure is effective to reduce railway noise.
210.It is to afforest areas along the railway especially the newly - built residential quarters and locomotive
depots. These areas may use mixed evergreen arbor, bush and lawn.
211 . Iong welded heavy - type steel rails can reduce noise 8 - lOdBa. It is required to lay the 60km long rails on
the up and down lines at Hengyang, Chenzhou, Yinde and Tangxi railway stations.
212.The Henyang 7th Railway School, Shaoguan 2nd RIailway Primary School, Guangzhou 4th Railway Primary
School and Guangzhou 2nd Railway Middle School are affected by the railway noise seriously . In consideration of
these schools located in densely - populated areas, the need of the railway staff' s children for the school in
nearby areas and the difficult relocation for school, it is required that the corridors of the teaching buildings
should be closed with aluminium alloy windows and installed with air - conditioning ventilation facilities in
classrooms.
213.The railway section of the main cities on the Wuhan - Guangzhou line should be taken with measures to
reduce vibration including adding shock absorbing pads and using 60kg/m long welded rails.
G.2.2 Electromagnetics protection measures
214. The newly - built tractive substations, switching stations, sectioning stations and service plants of
locamotive depots along the line should be as far from the residents in areas as possible. As to the existing
residential quatrers near to the electrification railway facilities, cable TV network should be set up to avoid
electrmagnetic interference.
G.2. 3  The Measures of Waste Water Treatment
215. According to the design, DG style sets should be taken at the battery rooms in Zhuzhou North and
Guangzhou Locomotive Depots. The waste water from Hengyang Locomotive Depot should be treated with oil
112



isolation and coke filtration methods instead of the less effective foam oil absorbing tank. Ihe waste water fim
the newly built Duoluockou Wagon Washing Point should be treated with sand precipitation,; idjusting
precipitation, air floating, coke filtration and active carbon absorbing methods. The treamnt capacities of the
air floating tank in Zhuzhou North Locomotive Depot will be increased because the treatment capacities'of the
existing equipment are not nough.
216. Acconling to the design, the waste water fiom Yueyang Lowmotive Depot should be hteated with adjusting
precipitation, air floating, filtration and active absorbing methods based on the featues of the waste water and
local govement requirement. The waste water fom Shaoguan Locomotive Depot will not be treated, so cannot
meet the rlated standard. It is to build a waste water treatnent station in this depot and the waste water should
be treated with oil isolation and air floating mediods.
G.2.4  Mitignofa    pic pollution
217. The new boilr will be equipped with smoke and dust purification equipment with the d    rate
ai t-2947%  to ensure dte boilers' air pollutant emissiocn      to reach the value of GB13Z71- 91
"Emission Standard of Boilers' Air Pollutant", i. e. smDke and dust concentration being 250mg/Nm3, SO2
being  2m /Nm3.
G.2.5 Disposal of soild waste
218. Boiler's slag and mtl scraps generated by the depots along the railway should be piled at special sites for
recycling.
219. It is to strenglthen administration over refuse collection system of passenger trains, forbidding littering along
the line. It is to guarnt that the fixed disposal of shall be done to turn the refuses harmless and become
resources.
220. As to the fixed refuse colection stations along the line, it is to set up a garbage classifying systern to recycle
useful materials and treat plastic wrapping materials not easily degradable in a centralized way to make them
unhariu .
G.2.6 Ecological protection measures
221. It is to plant trees on the edge of the subgrade and grass on the slope for protection of subgmade and slope
from rain erosion.
1.           G.3 Masures of Land Acquisiou, Rdocation and Restement
222. According to national and local land laws, some fanming population on the acquired land will becme non -
fanming populaton engaging in other occupations. The railway departments can empoly some peasants as
contracted workers for railway operation.
113



I
223. It is to rearn   land distributior and set up township enterpnses to employ peasants with the land
acquired as workers so that they leave the Lknd without leaving teir hometown.

G.4 Capital Ames_et of 1n 1omneta Pn)tcdon Mamr
224. According to the capital estimate of mitigation measur  to the envirnmnental iact, the investment in the  l
environmental pmtection of the capacity expansion project is primarily defined in Table G - 2. Environmental
measues and investment are msuied up in Table G- 3 and G- 4 based on construction and operation periods     l
and environmental elements.
225. In the process of the constnuction, the departmeb  assciated with design, constmution, construction
superision and odtes should pay much attention to the envinmental pmtection and make perfect and detailed
plans to put mitigatiby measures by the report into practice. The environmental protection facility construction  l
must be canried outi similtaneously with the capacity expansion project, as well as their design and operation.
Fig. G'- 1 shows the proceas of design, assessnent, cmstuction and operation of envionmental protection     l
facilities.      -       -

pollution . According to their opinions, railway noise is the focal point of pollution. The invesfigation records can
be smuaized as follows:
I Resdt along the line mainly camplained about raiway noise. As the Henang - Gwuang   Section is an
exsting one, aboti 85 peent of resients did not feel wmconfortable even though there was noise distuba . A
few people wre  accutomed to the noise envirunent. They felt uncfortable without the noise. Nearly 15% of
srsidents complained a lot about ailway noise, but they said that they could get used to it.
I .Schools and hiospitals were sensitive to the raiway noise. 100 percent of them felt the railwa noise
disturbance at differt degees. According to the investion, locomotive whisding was the largest diurbance
which caused the nmot comlaits.
;m . Accding to the investi n to the Leyang Station, dtae had not been heavy pollution generated by statin
|aoal yard and residents' lawsuit aimst sucih kind of impact in the past two decades.
IV. Aori  to th in          to the Maoshan Vilage adjaent to the Guangh  Noth Marshaling Yard, the
Cuanou North Ioootive Depot' s waste water discharge sometimes poluted the nearby farmland. As the
depot paid nmuch- aetion  o the waste iwatr treeant and gave   a        in time to frmers, the local
faimers did not have nuch cotplaint.
V . By soliciting opinions fmD all circles in any times, the assesment's methods and criterions were conirmned
by EPAs along the line and related experts.
248. n general, the assessment has done a Iot in public involvement. On the other hand, the Wuchang -
Guanzo line is a long line throu areas, so many units and people are affected. Viewing on this point, the
public involvement and itB scope are inideficiency. According to the conclusion of the investigation, most people
along the line were in favor of the project and thought it comprehensible. Most of them expressed that they would
do their best to support the project construction.
249. Since the project is still at the stage of feasibility study and preliminary design, problems arised from land
acquisition, relocation and rsetlement will be handled at the nest stage. Therefore, soliciting opinions forn
affected people will be done next.
