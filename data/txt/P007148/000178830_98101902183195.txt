INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO ADMINISTRACION NACIONAL DE TELECOMUNICACIONES
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF EL SALVADOR
FOR A SECOND TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to Administracion Nacional de Telecomunicaciones (ANTEL) with the
guarantee of the Republic of El Salvador for the equivalent of $9.5 million
for a telecommunications project. The loan would have a term of 20 years,
including a grace period of 5 years, with interest at 7-1/4 percent per
annum.
PART I - INTRODUCTION
2.        El Salvador has to date received nine Bank loans and two IDA
credits, totalling $71.5 million net of cancellations. Four loans and a
credit, totalling $30.2 million, have been made for power; three loans
and a credit, totalling $26.9 million, for transportation; one loan, amount-
ing to $9.5 million, for telecommunications; and one loan, amounting to
$4,.9 million, for education. The last operation, a credit for power, was
signed in January 1971. No other operations are scheduled for FY1972. The
Bank expects to make a loan of about $2.0 million for highways and a loan
of about $15.0 million for power in FY1973.
3.        As of February 29, 1972, a total of $10.6 million remained to be
disbursed on two loans and a credit. The final stages of construction on
a highway project for which a supplementary loan was made in December 1967
(Loan 521-ES) have been delayed by changes in the project, adverse weather
conditions and the war with Honduras. The project is now progressing
satisfactorily, with about 90 percent of the work completed; the Closing
Date has been postponed from June 30, 1971 to December 31, 1972. An
education loan made in June 1969 (Loan 609-ES) has been slow in starting
because of institutional difficulties within the education sector, in-
experience in international bidding procedures, and budgetary pressures
in the immediate post-war period. Meanwhile, the Government restructured
the country's education system, and this required some changes in the project.
The project is now progressing well, and is expected to be conpleted on
schedule. A credit for power, made in January 1971 (Credit 227-ES), only
became effective in October 1971 due to delr2s in obtairing congressional
ratification. The project is progressing on schedule.



4e.       IFC has made two investments in El Salvador.   The first, a
$VLO,000 loan in 1959 to Industrias Textiles, S.A., has been campletely
repaid. The second, a $233,000 equity investment and $600,000 loan to
Hoteles de Centro Am6rica, S.A., in 1969, is not yet fully disbursed.
The hotel project is expected to be completed in September 1972. No
other investments are under consideration at present.
5.        A summary of Bank loans, IDA credits, and IFC investments is
in Annex I.
6.        A $250,000 claim of British bondholders in respect to debts
owed by the Salvador Railway Company arose when the Company's assets were
transferred to the Republic of El Salvador in 1962. About a year ago a
mutually acceptable settlement of the claim was agreed upon, under which
payments were to be made in public bonds to the British bondholders. Slow
administrative procedures and elections in early 1972 have subsequently
delayed completion of the transaction, but the last formalities are now
expected to be campleted shortly.
7.        Presidential elections in February 1972 gave the Government's
candidate, Colonel Arturo Arimando Molina, only a plurality of votes. Thus,
in accordance with the Salvadoran constitation, the final choice rested
with the Parliament, which nominated Mr. Molina. The President-elect
is scheduled to take office on July 1, 1972. Mr. Molina was private
secretary to President Fidel Sanchez Hernandez during the current presi-
dential term, and no significant changes in the Government's policies are
expected, following his nomination.   Parliamentary elections in M4arch 1972
gave the Government party 38 of the 52 seats (compared with 34 during the
present legislature).
PART II - THE ECONOMY
R.        A report entitled "Current Economic Position and Prospects of
El Salvador" (CA-12a) was distributed to the Executive Directors on
October 20, 1971. The Bank's views on the main economic issues have
not changed materially since then.
9.        A serious imbalance between a rapidly growing population and
scant natural resources makes the solution of development problems in El
Salvador both urgent and difficult. At the growth rate of 3-lv percent annually
as in the sixties, the 1971 population of about 3.7 million is projected to
double by 1990 and to reach almost 10 million by the end of this century.
'The present low per capita availability of cultivable land for the rural
population (about 0.3 hectare) will decrease further, even assuming sub-
stantial migration fran rural to urban areas. Known-mineral resources are
scant, and fishing on the Pacific is limited by the narrow continental
shelf. The principal assets for El Salvador's development are its dynamic



-3-
entrepreneurial class and a labor force with demonstr ted ability to
acquire skills rapidly.
10.       The economy expanded rapidly in the sixties until 1966-67, at
about 6.5 percent annually, as a result of a surge in production of
manufactures for the Central American Common Market and of cotton. En-
trepreneurial drive, labor force adaptability, and infrastructure in
transport and electric power gave El Salvadorts industry a head-start
within the Central American Common Market (CACM). The contribution of
manufacturing to the gross domestic product increased from 15 percent to
almost 20 percent during the sixties.
11.       Nevertheless, the economy continued to depend heavily on coffee
and cotton as the major sources of domestic production and export earnings.
When in 1967 cotton production fell to half its 1965 peak level, as a result
of disease and expansion into marginal lands, economic growth slowed down
markedly, to about i percent.  The cotton crisis and weakness of the inter-
national coffee market held back the growth of export earnings to only about
1-2 percent annually from 1966 to 1969. The conflict with Honduras in 1969
represented another setback for the economy. Exports to the Common Market
declined as the border with Honduras was shut off and expensive arrange-
ments had to be undertaken for shipmentsto 'Nicaragua and Costa Rica. Export
earnings recovered sharply in 1970, as a result of higher coffee prices and
cotton recovery, but remained stationary in 1971, as declining coffee prices
and stagnating regional exports offset the effects of accelerated cotton
exports.
12.       The end of the export booa of the early sixties and the Common
l.4arket's problems led to a sharp decline of domestic savings and private
investment in 1967-70. The rate of growth of GDP fell sharply to 3.6 per-
cent in 1968, with some recovery to about !4.5 percent per year in 1969-71.
The return in 1969-70 of about 70,000 Salvadoran migrants from Honduras
contributed further to the pressure of population upon slowly expanding
domestic income, so that per capita income actually fell in 1968 and 1969,
and increased by only about one percent over the period 1970-71.
13.       Over the next few years earnings from traditional exports are
unlikely to expand rapidly, in view of the limited growth of the world demand
for coffee and the limited land available for increasing cotton production.
Full resumption of Common Market trade, which would permit the renewed growth
of manufactured exports to the region and spur private investment, is not yet
in sight, although some progress has been achieved in recent negotiations.
Ili.      In the longer term there is scope for considerable strengthening
of the economy by developing industry and non-traditional agriculture aimed
at the world markets. This will require land reclamation, irrigation, and
improvement of manpower skill. The long-term viability of the economy,
however, will also depend on well designed population policies and on a
more equitable distribution of the benefits of economic growth. Income
distribution has been hlghly concentrated in the past, leaving health, nu-
tritional and living standards of most of the population at a low level.



15.       The Governmentts cautious policies through the sixties were
geared principally to maintaining price stability and avo-iding foreign
exchange difficulties, without sufficient emphasis on the objective of
economic diversification. Fiscal and financial stability permitted the
private sector to exploit the opportunities offered by the creation of
the Common Market and the cotton boom. But a low level of tax revenues,
at about 10 percent of GDP, and weakc project preparation limited severely
the use of long-term foreign financing, and public investment remained
low. Yearly disbursements of foreign development loans fell sharply,
from about $28 million in 1965-66 to an average of about .$12 million in
1963-70. The share of public investment financed with domestic resources
rose from about two-thirds to more than four-fifths in the same period,
but public direct investment fell as a proportion of GDP from 3.6 percent
in 1965-66 to 2.5 percent in 1967-70. While progress was made in power
and transport, the postponement of development expenditures in other
sectors,particularly irrigation, rural development, public health and
telecommunications, resulted in growing social strains and serious bottle-
necks for economic growth.
16.       During the last two years the Government has been increasingly
aware of the gravity of development problems, and. has introduced a number
of reforms, including an increase in the tax on commercial transactions
(the first step in a long-studied plan of tax reforms), incentives for
exports outside Central America, an irrigation law, a banking law and a
new commercial code.  In addition, the Government established in the
Central Bank a guarantee fund for credit to small industrial entrepreneurs,
and liberalized the regulations for remittances abroad of profits from
foreign capital. A pilot irrigation project was satisfactorily completed.
Remarkable progress was made in setting up a technical and vocational
education system, and an intelligent use of televised education provided
a quick and effective way of improving teaching in high schools. The
Government also encouraged family planning and provided advisory services
in its clinics. Progress was achieved in the preparation of projects
which could form the basis for public investment expansion with long-term
foreign financing. The fiscal outlook improved and direct public invest-
ment in 1971 was about one-third higher than in 1970, reaching just under
3.5 percent of GDP.
17.       The Government has now prepared a short-term public investment
program for 1972-73 and is formulating a medium-term development plan
for the succeeding five years. On the basis of information available
from public agencies, the Bank prepared a tentative public invest-
ment program for 1972-76 as a contribution to the Governmentts
planning effort. This tentative program implies ap increase in the
share of public investment expenditures in GDP from 2.5 percent
in 1967-70 to about 4.5 percent in the late seventies, a target con-
sistent with a GDP growth of about 5 percent yearly. The public savings



-5-
effort required to finance such an undertaking is a substantial one as
compared with the past performance, but would be well within the capacity
of the economy. To avoid financing problems, Central Govermient current
revenues would have to increase to a level of 12 percent of GDP, compared
to about 10 percent in recent years. A variety of new fiscal measures
have already been studied and offer a wide choice of means to achieve the
necessary increase.
1)3.      The proposed investment program would facilitate progress towards
expanding and diversifying the economy and, at the same time, providing a
more even distribution of the benefits of economic growth. Irrigation
schemes, credit programs, and better extension services aimed at small and
medium farmers would improve El Salvador's prospects to export high-value
fruits and vegetables and substitute economically some of its food imports.
Industrial credit and education are also emphasized, along with low cost
public housing and water and sewerage facilities. Transport, power and
telecommunications would absorb about one-third of the investment program.
19.       Net international reserves increased by $15 million to $52 million
in 1970, and remained at $52 million in 1971, equivalent to nine weeks current
payments. The Government is likely to avoid balance of payments difficulties
by following, as in the past, cautious monetary and fiscal policies. A
stand-by arrangement with the IMF for $14 million expired at the end of
1971, and the Government plans to request a new stand-by arrangement in
July 1972, after the new Administration takes office. El Salvador has a
low public external debt. As of the end of 1971 the external debt in
foreign currency totalled $134 million including undisbursed amounts.
Most of the debt is due to international organizations and to USAID at
long terms. The resulting level of debt service -- about 5 percent of
export earnings in the next six or seven years -- is low. If better project
preparation is achieved, El Salvador could draw on multilateral aid much
more than in recent years and thus ease, to some extent, the problems of
balance of payments adjustment which will result from the expected low
rate of export growth.
20.       Apart from the Bank, external financing is principally provided
by USAID, the Interamerican Development Bank (IDB) and the Central American
Bank for Economic Integration (CABEI). The IDB has made loans for housing,
water and sewerage, ports, highways, agricultural credit, industry, higher
education and municipal markets. USAID has financed health centers, primary
education, housing, and industry. CABEI has financed industry and also
highway and telecommunications projects of importance for the Central
American network. The past lending of these agencies is summarized below.
Though these agencies are likely to continua supporting projects in the
same sectors, their programs are still tentative.  The IDB is interested
in financing tourism, irrigation, road maintenance and project preparation,
but none of these operations is at an advanced stage. We are endeavoring
to coordinate our possible financing in these sectors with the IDB.

1/ Includes some local currency loans.
21.         The terms of loans from other development agencies are usually
softer than those of Bank loans. AID loans have a term of )oif years with
interest of 2 to 3 percent, and most IDB loans are extended from the Fund
for Special Operations, carrying 3-1! percent interest rates and terms
ranging from 15 to 30 years. The terms of CABEI loans -- which often
provide 100 percent financing of local expenditures -- vary in accordance
with CABEI's sources of financing, but generally contain a substantial
concessionary element. USAID and the Bank Group, which each held roughly
one-third of the debt repayable in foreign currency at the end of 1971,
are El Salvador's largest external creditors.
22.       In the past, Bank Group lending has been directed mainly towards
the strengthening of economic infrastructure such as power, roads, and
telecommunications, and to a lesser extent toward education. The Bank
joined the IDB and CABEI in assisting the development of El Salvador's
arterial highway system. The Bank also developed a close relationship
with El Salvador's public power agency (CEL) and helped it to develop
into one of the most efficient power companies in Central America.
23.        The Bank plans to continue lending for power, transportation
and telecommunications, given the growing needs in these sectors. In the
recent past, however, inadequate project preparation and the delays of
Congress in approving foreign loans have been major obstacles to expand and
diversify the Bank's and other agencies' operations. During recent dis-
cussions with the Government, the Bank reiterated the importance of devising
a practical development strategy, including a substantially expanded public



-7-
investment program. The Bank is closely following the preparation of the
development plan, but no firm understanding on policies is likely until
the new Administration is installed in July 1972. Should, however, the
incoming administration adopt the approach to development planning dis-
cussed in paragraphsl6-18 above, the range of Bank lending in the future
should be extended to agriculture and family planning, with further
support to education.
2),.      With respect to agriculture the Bank has for some time con-
sidered the possibility of loans for irrigation and livestock. The Bank
*appraised an irrigation project in 1968 and an FAO mission identified in
1970 a livestock project, but the Government has not yet defined its
policies and priorities with respect to these sectors. With respect to
industry,.the Bank is actively exploring the possibilities for channelling
its lending to El Salvador and the other Central American countries
through the Central American Bank for Economic Integration. The Govern-
ment has shown interest in Bank assistance in the field of population
policies and in further loans for education; a UiESCO mission has
recently visited El Salvador to identify a project for Bank financing.
For the immediate future, the Bank is proposing to make a small loan in
FY1973 for improvements of the secondary and farm roads network in the
northern region, and a loan to the power agency (CEL) for a hydroelectric
powier project.
PART III - THE FROJECT
Sector Background
;'5.      Development of telecommunications in El Salvador has lagged
behind the rapidly growing needs of industry and commerce, sectors which
played an important role in the country's economic growth and are expected
to become even more important in the future. At present, insufficient
capacity and spread of the local telephone exchanges and the long-distance
network have become a serious bottleneck, and have prompted the Government
to rank telecommunications high among immediate development priorities.
'6.       The telephone density in El Salvador, 1.1 telephones per 100
persons, is considerably lower than that of Panama (4.2), Costa Rica (3.0)
and Nicaragua (1.3). El Salvador has 35 local automatic exchanges with a
total capacity of about bo,000 lines and 28,000 working connections.   An
additional 1,00n connections operate off small capacity manual exchanges
in rural areas. The growth of telephone lines since 1967 (8 percent per
year) has been considerably slower than in Central America as a whole
(13 percent per year).



- 8 -
27.       About 74 percent of all connections are in the metropolitan
area of San Salvador, the capital of the country. Even though the
number of'connected subscribers in the city has trebled, the central
and most important automatic exchange in this city has not been expanded
since 1958, and no new connections have been made to this exchange since
1966, when saturation was reached. This has resulted in a large un-
satisfied demand in the business area, and congestion and poor service
in the whole city. Furthermore, insufficient investment in the dis-
tribution network has brought about a high fault incidence. In areas
outside the capital, demand for local telephone service is largely being
met, but the long-distance service, which was established essentially
within the past five years', is also congested.
28.       The five Central American countries are now linked by a high
quality microwave system which was recently completed at a cost of about
$11.8 million, of which El Salvador provided $2.'7 million. Though not
yet fully automatic, a large part of the network was in operation in
January 1972. International telephone service is routed through high
frequency radio telephone circuits to the United States. International
telex service, which was introduced in El Salvador in 1968, has grown
rapidly and is operating satisfactorily.
29.       In 1963 the Government, on the advice of the Bank and with the
support of a $9.5 million Bank loan (Loan 358-ES), reorganized the tele-
communications sector and placed it under a new autonomous agency, the
Administraci6n Nacional de Telecomunicaciones (ANTEL). The project
financed by the Bank was satisfactorily completed by ANTEL in 1968. Sub-
sequent expansion of telecommunications, however, was hamliered by adminis-,
trative, financial and 6iigineering problems in ANTEL. Largely as a
result of Bank missions'and advice, most of the difficulties of ANTEL
have now been solved, and a medium-term investment program has been
prepared to narrow substantially the gap between demand and supply (see
below, paragraph 36). In addition to the present project, the Bank
expects to consider financing a third project within the next five
years, since commercial and residential demand for telephone services
continues to grow fast.
Project Enti&
30.       ANTEL is an autonomous Government-owned public corporation.
It has the right to plan, acquire, construct and operate telecommunication
facilities. It also has the authority to fix tariffs and other charges
for its services, subject to approval of the Ministry of Economy. It is
administered by a five-member Board of Directors, each with a term of
four years. The President of the Board is appointed by the President of
the Republic. The remaini'ng four directors are appointed respectively
by the Minister of Econcmy, the Minister of the Interior, the banking
sector, and the agricultural, industrial and coinmerciial associations.
ANTEL's day-to-day business is administered by the President of the Board
and by a General Manager.  Of ANTEL's total telecommunications staff of



-9-
2,300, about 1,300 are telephone employees. During negotiations for the
proposed loan, ANTEL assured the Bank that it would limit the strength
of its non-technical staff during the period of construction of the Project
to about the present level,to encourage labor productivity.
Project Description and Financing Plan
31.       A report entitled "Appraisal of the Second Telecommunications
Project of the Administraci6n Nacional de Telecomunicaciones (ANTEL), El
Salvador" (PU-78a, dated March 9, 1972) is being distributed separately.
The main features of the project are summarized in Annex III.
32.       A Bank mission appraised ANTEL's expansion program for 1971-73
in llovember 1970 and prepared an appraisal report in March 1971. At that
time, however, ANTEL entered into a turnkey conitract for an exchange
which had been part of the proposed Bank project. This required the
preparation of a revised project for construction in 1972-75 excluding the
part of ANTEff's program which was carried out without international
competitive bidding. This revised project was appraised in August/
September 1971.
33.       Negotiations for the proposed loan were held in Washington in
November 1971. ANTEL was represented by Messrs. Vicente Sanchez Hernandez,
President of the Board of Directors- Roberto Morales, Financial Manager-
Juan Antonio Carillo, Chief Engineer; and Oscar Edgardo Lara, General
Counsel. The Government of El Salvador was represented by Messrs. Joaquin
Morazan Bonilla, Sub-secretary of Economy; and Jos6 Guillermo Pantoja
Espinal, of the National Economic Planning Council (C6NAPLAN).
34.       The project consists of:
(a) installation of 18,000 additional lines of local automatic
telephone exchange equipment;
(b) expansion of local cable network and subscriber facilities
to provide about 14,500 additional telephone exchange con-
nections;
(c) installation of long-distance equipment on various routes
to provide about 750 additional circuits; and
(d) services of technical consultants to assist ANTEL's staff
in procurement and in forecasting, planning and project
preparation for ANTEL's 1976-80 program.
The project would be carried out during 1972-75 with the purpose of:
(i) increasing local automatic telephone exchange line capacity by about
37 percent, thus removing the congestion in the local networks; (ii) pro-
viding a 150 percent increase in long-distance circuits to improve service



- 10 -
and meet the growth of the demand; (iii) satisfying the backlog of
applications for telephone service in metropolitan San Salvador and
meeting part of the new demand for telephones.   As a result of the
project, telephone density in El Salvador would increase from the
present 1.1 telephones per 100 persons to 1.3.
35.       The project is estimated to cost $12.7 million equivalent.
The proposed loan of $9.5 million would cover the foreign exchange cost
of the project, and possibly a small amount of local costs which would
be part of the total costs of procurement, if any, in San Salvador (see
paragraph ho). The   project forms the main part of ANTEL's t$21.5 million
(1971-75) investment programi, for which a satisfactory financing plan has
been prepared. About 40 percent of the funds required for this program
are expected to be generated within AITEL, about i15 percent from the
proposed Bank loan, 12 percent from a CABEI loan, and the remaining 3 per-
cent from a Government loan.
36.       ANTEL's 1971-75 expansion program includes, in addition to the
project proposed for Bank financing: (i) completion of the El Salvador
section of the Central American microwave network commissioned in
November 1971; (ii) ongoing works for the extension of local distribution
cables in San Salvador; (iii) installation of an additional 8,000-line
automatib exchange in central San Salvador together with associated
subscriber and inter-office cables, (iv) extension of the long-distance
automatic exchanges by 960 lines   and (v) construction of ANTEL's head-
quarters building. Execution of this program will go some way toward
eliminating service deficiencies, by removing congestion in the local and
long-distance network.  Nevertheless, the current backlog of unsatisfied
demand and the projected demand growth of 10 to 13 percent per year in
different areas of the capital city indicate that ANTEL will be unable
to satisfy fully the demand for telephone services by 1975. The gap is
expected to be closed only in the next expansion phase, as the present
program is the largest which ANTEL can reasonably be expected to implement
at this time, in view of its present technical and administrative
capability.
Financial Aspects
37.       ANTEL's financial position, which has improved substantially
since 1967 when steps were taken to strengthen financial management and
to remove liquidity problems, is now sound and expected to remain so.
During the period 1967-1970 ANTEL's net operating income increased by
115 percent and the rate of return on its net fixed assets in operation
averaged about 12 percent. During the project period 1972-75 A4TEL is
expected to earn an annual rate of return of about 13 percent. ANTEL has
agreed to maintain a rate of return of no less than 10 percent during the
term of the loan. In addition, ANTEL has agreed to revise its tariff
structure, in consultation with the Bank, taking into account. recom-
mendations of an expert retained by ANTEL for a tariff study in 1969.



38.       ANTEL's debt/equity ratio would be 50/50 at the end of 1976,
thus leaving a fair margin for further borrowing. The current position
throughout the project period would be satisfactory. The debt service
coverage by internal cash generation is expected to be satisfactory,
ranging from 1.5 in 1971 to 2.8 in 1976. ANTEL has agreed not to incur
any medium- or long-term debt without the Bank's prior approval, unless
its net revenues would cover debt service at least 1.5 times.
30.       Under a special agreement, ANTEL has been offsetting the charges
to the Government for use of telecammunication services against payments
due from ANTEL to the Government for the value of assets transferred when
AFR'EL was formed in 1963. The Government has not yet entered these re-
payments in its books but has agreed to issue an executive order to
record properly these transactions and to assure Government payment for
telecommunication services after the cost of the transferred assets is
fully payed in 1972.
Procurement
110.      Goods financed by the Bank would be procured through international
competitive bidding, except for certain additions (about $0.6 million) to
existing equipment where compatibility is essential and for which prices
would be negotiated with the supplier of the existing equipment, which was
procured after international competitive bidding under Loan ES-358.
In the light of the arrangements contained in the Central American Agree-
ment on Fiscal Incentives for Industrial Development, which have been
called to the attention of the Executive Directors on previous occasions,
suppliers within the Central American Common Market would receive a
preference of 15 percent of the c.i.f. price or 50 percent of existing
custom duties, whichever is the lower. The value of orders placed in
Central America under the proposed arrangement is expected to be less than
$1.7 million, including possible procurement in El Salvador of about
$l.n million, of which about $0.3 million would represent local costs.
Disbursement
i,L.      Disbursements of the loan would be for the foreign exchange cost
of imported equipment and consulting services, and 95 percent of the ex-
factory cost of any item procured within El Salvador, representing the
estimated cost net of taxes.
Economic Justification
l2.       The project is technically sound and economically justified.   The
internal financial rate of return is estimated at 18.6 percent. This rate
understates the economic rate of return, because benefits accruing from
reduced congestion and improved telecommunications services for economic
activity, functioning of government and social services are not fully
reflected in the net revenues accruing from the project.

PART IV - LEGAL INSrUIMENTS AND AUTHORITY
L3.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and AIXTEL, the draft
Guarantee Agreement between the Republic of El Salvador and the Bank, the
Report of the Committee p,rovided for in Article III, Section ht (iii) of
the Articles of Agreement and the text of the Resolution approving the
proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
The draft agreements conform to the normal pattern of loans for tele-
communications projects. Of special interest are the provisions concerning
technical assistance and expansion planning (Section 3.02, Loan Agreement),
and procurement of extensions  to existing equipment (Sched4'tii)i, paragraph
2, Loan Agreement).                                          -
4ht.      I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART V - RECOMMENDATION
h5.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.
