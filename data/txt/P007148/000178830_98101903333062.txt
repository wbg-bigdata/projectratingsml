ADMINISTRACION NACITONAL DE TELECOMUNICACIONES (ANTEL)
APPRAISAL OF THE SECOND TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLJSIONS
i.        This report covers the appraisal of a four-year (1972-75) project
forming part of the five-year (1971-75) development program of the Adminis-
tracion Nacional de Telecomunicaciones (ANTEL). A Bank loan of US$9.5
million is proposed to cover all the foreign exchange costs of the project,
whose total cost is estimated to be 031.7 million (US$12.7 million).
ii.       The project would alleviate the present congestion and meet part
of the estimated demand during 1971-75 by providing for an additional
18,000 local exchange lines, mostly in San Salvador, and for the expansion
of the long distance network. The internal financial rate of return of the
project is estimated to be 18.6%.
iiie      All project items to be financed by the Bank, except some exten-
sion equipment, would be procured through international competitive bidding.
For reasons of economy and standardization, extensions to equipment estimated
to cost about US$0.6 million would be procured from existing suppliers at
prices to be approved by the Bank.
iv.       The proposed loan would be the Bank's second telecommunications
lending operation in El Salvador; the first one, Loan 358-ES, was made in
1963 for a project to provide local and long distance equipment. That
project was completed satisfactorily in December 1968.
v.        The Borrower would be ANTEL, a Government-owned corporation which
is responsible for domestic and international telecommunications in El Sal-
vador. WhLile ANTEL's financial management is satisfactory, the technical
organization does not have the expertise needed to prepare the project
engineering details and plans. ANTEL has therefore agreed to retain techni-
cal consultants to assist the engineers on the project.
7i.       ANTEL's financial position is satisfactory.  In the past few years
the Corporation has managed to convert an unfavorable financial situation
to one of reasonable soundness, and during the project period 1972-75 would
provide about 40% of its investmient requirements from internal cash genera-
tion. During that period, liquidity would be sufficient to meet current
obligations and the annual rate of return on net fixed assets in operation
would average 13%.
vii.      During negotiations agreement was reached on the points set out
in paragraph 7.01. The project would be suitable for a Bank loan of
USS9.5 million for a term of 20 years, including a grace period of five years.

ADMINISTRACION NACIONAL DE TELECOMUNICACIONES (ANTEL)
APPRAISAL OF THE SECOND TELECOMMWNICATIONS PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of the Republic of El Salvador has requested
Bank assistance in the financing of a telecommunications project to
extend and improve the existing facilities. This would be the Bank's
second lending coperation for telecommunications in that country.
1.02      The proposed Borrower is the Administracion Nacional de Tele-
comnnicaciones (ANTEL), a Government-owned corporation responsible for
the country's domestic and international telecommunications services.
1.03      In 1963, the Bank approved a US$9.5 million loan to ANTEL to
help finance the foreign exchange costs of a project designed to increase
the local telephone exchange capacity and to improve the long distance
service. The project was completed satisfactorily in December 1968.
l.oh      In the preparation of a further program of expansion, ANTEL ran
into difficulties due to the lack of a chief engineer and supporting plan-
ning staff and the settlement of overdue accounts with suppliers. Three
Bank missions visited El Salvador in January and June 1969 and in June
1970 to review these problems. Following discussions during these visits,
ANTEL strengthened the financial organization, negotiated settlements with
the suppliers for rescheduling payments to them, and prepared a program of
expansion. In November 1970 a mission composed of Messrs. M. DeLima,
H. Hillebrenner and B. Holmgren appraised the project. In Febrdary 1971
ANTEL, in order to give a number of telephones to waiting applicants before
the presidential and congressional elections in February-March 1972,
awarded a turnkey contract for the Centro exchange which was a part of the
original project. This necessitated preparation of a revised project
excluding the equipment procured under the turnkey project. Messrs. DeLima
and Hillebrenner visited El Salvador during August/September 1971 to appraise
the revised project.

2. THE ECONOMY AND THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SECTOR
The Economy
2.01      El Salvador, with an area of 21,000 km2 and situated on the
Pacific Ocean between Guatemala and Honduras, is the smallest of the main-
land Latin American countries. Its population totals some 3.5 million, of
whom about 0.6 million live in San Salvador, the capital and commercial and
administrative center of the country. San Miguel in the east and Santa
Ana and Sonsonate in the west are the other major urban centers.
2.02      The 1970 gross domestic product was estimated to be US$935 million
and the annual per capita income US$260.  The economy is based mainly on
coffee, cotton, fish, sugar and textiles. The major exports are coffee
(US$114 million), cotton (US$23 million), shrimp (US$5 million) and
sugar (US$7 million).
2.03      Most of the industrial production is concentrated in the area
around San Salvador, while coffee, cotton and sugar are produced in the
areas around San Miguel, Santa Ana, San Vincente and Sonsonate (see Map).
La Union, La Libertad and Acajutla, the main ports, handle the bulk of the
foreign trade.
2.04      For the development of national resources and to provide a rapid,
reliable means of exchanging information between the producers, ports and
San Salvador as the country's administrative and business center, adequate
telecommunication services are essential. The project aims at extending
and improving such services.
Telecommunications Sector
2.05      ANTEL is responsible for all public services in the telecomuni-
cations sector. When not able to provide suitable long distance service,
ANTEL allows private users to obtain licenses from the Government on an
annual basis to operate point-to-point HF radio systems. The military,
civil aviation and maritime authorities have established some telecommuni-
cation facilities for their special operational needs.
Existing Telecommunication Facilities
2.06      The telephone density in El Salvador as of January 1, 1971, was
1.11 telephones per 100 persons. Annex 1 sets out statistical information
on telephones in various countries of the world. The existing exchanges and
the long distance network in El Salvador are shown on the map. These
facilities are inadequate in quality, capacity and spread to meet the country's
needs. Annex 2 sets out basic data on the existing facilities and the 1971-
75 expansion program.
Local Telephone Service
2.07      As of December 31, 1970, there were 35 local automatic exchanges
with a capacity of 40,320 lines and 28,h34 connected lines, along with a



- 3 -
number of small magneto exchanges with 1,074 connected lines.  A list of
the automatic exchanges together with their capacity and the number of
connected lines iS in Annex 3. The growth of connected lines from 1967
to 1970 (see Annex 4) has -anged from L% to 17%, with an average of 8%
per year.
Long Distance Service
2.08      Long distance service (see map) is provided between the principal
urban centers by a microwave system. Less important towns are connected to
the network on open-wire lines with carrier systems. Facilities for sub-
scriber dialing of long distance calls are available to nearly all subscribers
on the automatic exchange network; for the others, long distance service is
provided on a semi-automatic basis.
Telegraph Service
2.09      San _alvador is connected by telex and fixed point-to-point
teleprinter circuits to 15 traffic centers using voice frequency telegraphs
over microwave and carrie- systems. Another 200 telegraph offices in the
country are connected by open-wire lines to these traffic centers.
2.10      A telex system of 200 lines with 130 subscribers is working at
San Salvador. There are presently 15 applicants awaiting telex facilities,
which cannot be provided for lack of cable capacity.
International Facilities
2.11      For places outside Central America,  international telephone traffic
is handled by high frequency (HF) radio telephone circuits connecting San
Salvador to Jacksonville, Florida, whence the traffic is routed to all places
in the United States and elsewhere in the world. Except traffic to Panama
which uses HF radio facilities, the traffic to the Central American countries
is handled by circuits provided on very high frequency (VHF) radio, microwave
and open-wire carrier systems. The international manual exchange is in San
Salvador.
2.12      Using HF radio facilities, ANTEL connects with the International
Telegraph and Telephone Company (ITT) and Radio Corporation of America (RCA)
in New York and from thence to transmit all international traffic to places
in the United States and to the rest of the world with the exception of
traffic to Panama and Guatemala. Traffic to Panama is transmitted on a
direct HF radio circuit via ITT, while Guatemala traffic is routed via a
direct connection to that country.
2.13      International telex service, introduced in El calvador in 1968,
has grown rapidly. The traffic, which totalled 31,000 paid minutes that
first year, has increased to 130,000 paid minutes in 1970.
2.14      With the commissioning of the Central American microwave network
in November 1971, El Salvador has been connected to Costa Rica, Guatemala,
Honduras and Nicaragua by 196 long distance circuits, with extensions to
Mexico from Guatemala and to Panama from Costa Rica.  Dbtails of the scheme
are shown in Annex 5.



-14 -
Quality of Service
2.15      Lack of investment and proper planning in the past has caused
the telephone network to have a number of deficiencies, which in turn
have led to poor service   There is a long waiting list of applications,
congestion on local and long distance routes, and a high fault incidence
in the local distribution network.
2.16      In the San Salvador exchange system the main difficulties have
arisen because of the lack of expansion since 1958 of the Centro automatic
exchange, the most important one in the city, even though the number of
connected subscribers in the city has increased threefold. This has resulted
in acute congestion on all calls flowing into and out of this exchange.
Inadequate investment in the cable distribution network has made it necessary
to extend the network by long lengths of drop wire, which has brought about
a high incidence of faults. Congestion on the long distance routes has been
caused by an insufficient number of circuits. ANTEL's 1971-75 expansion
program (see paragraph 3.01 and Annex 7) is designed to eliminate these
difficulties and improve the service.



3.  THE PROGRAM AND PROJECT
The Program
3.01      ANTEL has drawn up and the Government has approved a development
program to be carried cut during 1971-75, comprising the following main items:
(a) Completion of the Central American microwave network--El Salvador
section (see Annex 5 for details);
(b) ongoing works for extension of local distribution cables in
San Salvador;
(c) installation of an 8,000-line automatic exchange at Centro
with associated subscriber and inter-office cables;
(d) extension of the long distance automatic exchanges by 960 lines;
(e) construction of ANTEL's headquarters building; and
(f) the project for Bank financing described in paragraph 3.02 below.
The cost of the program (see Annex 6 for details) is estimated to be M5l.2
million (USs20.5 million), including a foreign exchange component of US$15.3
million equivalent (038.3 million). The proposed installations are listed
in Annex 7.
The Project
3.02      The project would be carried out during the four-year period 1972-
75 as part of the 1971-75 development program, and consists principally of
the following (details are in Annex 8):
(a) Installation of 18,000 additional lines of local automatic
exchange equipment;
(b) local exchange cable network and telephone equipment at subscribers'
premises to provide 1h,500 exchange connections;
(c)  installation of long distance equipment on various routes to
provide about 750 more circuits; and
(d) technical consultants to advise ANTEL on preparation of speci-
fications and bid documents and on bid evaluation (Draft terms of
reference are showm in Annex 9).

-6-
3.0k      The cost estimatee for equipment and cables are based on recent
experience of costs in Sar Salvador and adjacent countries and reflect ade-
quately the effecJs of changes in the values of foreign currencies; in
addition the cost estimates include a contingency provision of 10%. This
provision is expected to be adequate since the trend of equipment prices
has been downward due to improvements in design and manufacture; in respect
of cables also the copper prices currently are less than those used in
preparing the cost estimates.  No separate price contingency has therefore
been provided ir, equipment and cable items.  A price contingency of about
10% of the cos4 of building materials has been separately provided.  In
addition, to cover quantitative increase of equipment and cables due to
design changes, a contingency allowance of 5% has been provided in foreign
and local costs of these items, and a further 5% in local costs to cover
increases in salaries and wages.
Execution of the Project
3.05      The schedule for execution of the project is given in Annex 10.
This schedule is realistic. AREL staff would draw up the specifications,
do the planning, and lay and commission the iiocal cables. The civil eng-
ineering work of laying ducts and constructing manholes would be done by
local contractors under supervision of ANTEI, staff.
3.06      The technical consultants (see paragraph 5.06) would help ANTEL
with the engineering and procurement of the automatic exchanges, coaxial
cable and long distance equipment. ANTEL would provide the installation
staff to work under supervision of the supplier's engineers, who would be
responsible for laying the coaxial cable and for the installation and
performance of all equipment obtained under the project.
Procurement
3.07      The equipment for the project would be procured through interna-
tional competitive bidding, except for certain additions to existing equip-
inent. These exceptions, consisting of extension to local exchanges, are
estimated to have a total cost of about Us$0.6 million or about 7% of the
procurement to be financed by the Bank. The installations to which this
equipment would be added were procured after international bidding under
Toan 358-ES, and ANTEL proposes to procure the additions from the original
suppliers. The prices to be paid would be based on the original prices and
would be subject to the Bank's approval prior to placement of orders.
3008      ANTEL's proposals are in line with the plans for these extensions
of switching equipment in existing exchanges drawn up at the time of the
initial installation for a least cost system development. To allow for
future extensions to the planned capacity, equipment common to the total
installation was provided in the first phase of the expansion program; hence
the required additional equipment must be of the same type. The only practical
way of filling the exchanges to the planned capacity is to add equipment of
the same type as already installed. To go in for completely new installations
would result in foregoing planned economies.

3.09      El 3alvador is a member of the Central American Common Market.
Tn accordance with the Central American Agreement on Fiscal Incentives
for Industrial Development, ANTEL is obliged to give suppliers from
member countries a preference of 50% of the import duties applying to
suppliers from non-member countries. Suppliers from Central American
countries would be allowed, in accordance with current Bank policies, a
preference in bid evaluation of 15% of the "'F price or 50% of the import
duties, whichever is lower. It is expected that the value of orders
placed in Central America under this arrangement would not exceed US$1.7
million, including procurement -n El Salvador of about U3tl.0 million.
Disbursements
3.10      The estimated disbursements of the loan during the 1972-75
project period are shown in Annex 11. Disbursement would be for the
CIF costs of imported equipment, the foreign costs of superviLiory personnel
and consultants, and for 95 of the total expenditures on locally procured
cables (the balance of 5% represents local taxes) up to a maximum of 1'S`1.0
million equivalent. As ANTEL cannot meet the anticipated demand for tele-
communications facilities during the oroject neriod, any unused balance
of the loan would be used to finance additional equipment, similar to
that already procured under the loan, after consultation with the Bank.

4. JUSTIFICATION
4.01      El Salvador is under-sUrDlied with telecommunication services in
that the network is congested and there is unsatisfied demand for telephones
in metropolitan San Salvador.  The project is designed to reduce these de-
ficiencies by (a) removing the congestion in the local and long distance
network, and (b) meeting part of the new demand for telephones.  On completion
of the project, the telephone density wil1 increase from the present 1.11
telephones per 100 persons to 1.3. it is not possible to plan for a higher
rate of growth at this time because of nersonnel as well as financial
constraints.
Demand for Subscriber Lines in Metropolitan San Salvador
4.o2      In metropolitan San Salvador, with 74% of all telephone subscribers
in the country, demand cannot be met because the Centro exchange serving the
area has been saturated since 1966 and no new connections have been given in
Centro since then. ANTEL's demand forecast conservatively estimates the
unsatisfied demand in the Centro exchange area by assuming that demand at
the time of saturation (1966) was equal to supply, that it increased since
then by the national average growth of telephones (8% annually) up to 1970,
and that the demand growth rate thereafter will be between 10% and 13%,
depending on commercial activity in the areas concerned. Unsatisfied demand
is most likely under-estimated because the national average growth of tele-
phones reflects supply which was itself constrained and because telephone
growth in the urban areas is higher than in the country as a whole.
4.03      ANTEL projects demand in 1975 to be about 50,000 (based on the
above-mentioned future growth rates of 10-13%). The actual nunber of
connections planned upon completion of the project is about 42,000 and thus
would meet only part of the demand. This gap between supply and demand is
due to ANTEL's presently limited capability to take on a bigger program of
expansion, and is expected to be closed in the next phase.
Demand for Subscriber Lines Outside Metropolitan San Salvador
4.04      In the exchange areas outside San Salvador, which serve the
remaining 26% of the telephone subscribers, all the demand is being met.
Demand based on historical growth figures is expected to increase from
6,200 at the end of 1970 to about 8,000 at the end of 1975. The exchanges
that are close to capacity are being extended as required, resulting in the
addition of 1,000 lines. Another 1,000 lines of equipment are being installed
to replace ten local battery exchanges. In 1975 the total capacity of the
lines will be 15,720.
Demand for Long Distance Facilities
4.05      Precise traffic forecasts are difficult to make under conditions
like those in El Salvador, which has practically no network history. The
network, including long distance facilities, was established essentially
within the past five years and is congested. The demand forecast, which



- 9 -
has been worked out for each route, takes into account the expected increase
in new subscribers and the calls being lost because of the congestion. The
project is designed to meet this demand and provides for a 150% increase in
the number of circuits, to a total of 1,250.
Least-Cost Solution
4.o6      The project does not include any major item for which an evaluation
of alternatives is feasiDle; it provides for a large number of small additions
over the whole network.  All exchange, multiplex and carrier equipment provided
under the project would be located in existing buildings and is, in fact, an
expansion of existing facilities; thus there are no realistic alternatives in
locations. All fundamental decisions determining the system were made in the
early 1960's. These are still sound and provide the framework for the least-
cost system development.
Internal Financial Rate of Return
4,.07     The internal financial rate of return on the project at present
tariffs is 18.6% (see Annex 12). A sensitivity analysis (paragraph 7 of
Annex 12) has been carried out, showing that the rate of return is between
12% and 24% for variations of the main parameters of 10%. This internal
rate of return, which is above the opportunity cost of capital, is a minimum
estimate of the internal economic rate of return.

5. THE BORROWER
5.01      ANTEL, the proposed borrower, is responsible for all domestic
and international telecommunication services in El Salvador. Created by
Act of August 27, 1963,as an autonomous Government-owned public corpora-
tion, ANTEL has the right to plan, acquire, construct and operate tele-
communication facilities.  It also has authority to fix tariffs and other
charges for its services (see paragraph 6.13), subject to approval of the
Minister of Economics.
QgEanization
: .02     8NTEL is administered by a five-member Board of Directors, each
ui<th a tenure of four years, designated as follows:
(a)  one full-time director, appointed by the President of the
Republic to hold the office of President of the Board;
(b)  two directors and two alternates, one each appointed by the
Minister of Economy and Minister of the Interior;
(c)  one director and one alternate, elected by banks operating
in El Salvador; and
(d)  one director and one alternate, elected by agricultural,
industrial and commercial associations.
ANTEL's day-to-day business is administered by the President of the Board
and by the General Manager, who also functions as the Secretary of the Board.
5.03      An organization chart is shown in Annex 13.  Under the President
and General Manager are separate departments for telecommunications planning
and for commercial, financial and telecommunications operations. This
organizational setup is similar to that of maTy other telecommunication
entities and is satisfactory. Until about two years ago, however, the
financial and technical sections were weak due largely to staff shortages.
A11TEL has taken action to improve the situation.
5.0o      Appointment of a Financial Manager and a Chief Accountant has
strengthened ANTEL's financial management. Accounting procedures are in
line with accepted commercial practices and allow for meaningful financial
analysis. Billing and the payroll are computerized and efficient. Balance
sheets and income statements are prepared on a monthly basis, within one
month.  A cost accounting system is used to analyze, on a monthly basis,
the revenue and costs of ANTEL's main services.
5.05      The technical maintenance organization has likewise been strengthened
by the appointment of a Chief Engineer, the recruitment of qualified engineers
and training abroad. Maintenance of equipment obtain.Ld under the previous
Bank loan was taken over by ANTEL two years ago from the suppliers, who earlier
had a contract for this work. ANTEL is maintaining the equipnent satisfactorily.



- 11 -
5.06      Recently, ANTEL set up the nucleus of a planning and traffic
unit. While the unit is competent to handle cable planning and engineering,
4t- does not have the exDerience needed to draw up specifications and do the
engineering of the exchange and long distance equipment to be provided under
the project.  ANTEL has agreed during negotiations to engage technical
consultants acceptable to the Bank to assist ANTEL in procurement of equip-
*  ent provided in the project and in the preparation of a 1976-80 telecommu-
nications development r'rogram. AMZTEL proposes to have some of its engineers
work with these consultants to gain experience.  I; is expected that the
consultants' services will be needed for about a year, but the period should
be extended if continued assistance is necessary.
Staff
5.07      ANTEL's staff totals about 2,300, of whom 1,300 are telephone
employees. ExcluWing the 1,000 telegraph employees and with 37,800
working telephones in M Salvador, the employee ratio works out to 34 per
1,000 telephones.  The telephone staff includes 400 operators and adminis-
trative personnel. Since that number is adequate to handle increased
workload during construction of the project, ANTEL has given assurances
during negotiations thnat it will maintain the strength of non-technical
staff during the project period at a level no higher than the present ore.
This is expected to increase productivity and reduce the employee ratio
to about 23 per 1,000 telephones by 1975, which is a reasonable ratio
considering there is a large open-wire trunk network.
5.08      Annex 14 gives details of number of employees in each department,
pay scales and service conditions. The pay scales are commensurate with
duities and the salaries are comparable with those paid by similar entities
for similar duties and qualifications. Turnover of staff is negligible.
Training
5.09      Operating, clerical and lower-grade technical staff are trained
within ANTEL. Engineers are trained in Europe, and technicians in 1Mfexico.
For the special needs of the Central American microwave network, the
contractor is training engineers and technicians in Costa ilica. ANTEL's
present training program will enable it to have adequately trained personnel
for the construction, operation and maintenance of the present and projected
additions to its facilities.
5.10      The Government has agreed to a proposal from the International
Telecommunications Union (ITU) to locate a regional training center in
San Salvador to meet the needs of telecommunications entities in Costa Xica,
Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador for training intermediate
and high-level telecommunications staff. After some delays this scheme is
now getting under way.  Since ANTEL's annual requirement for such techirial
staff is relatively small and since there are alternative trairnng schemes3
the delayed start of the regional training scheme will not have any significant
effect on the operation and maintenance of AN'TEL's facilities.

6. FINANCES
Sunmmary of ANTEL' s Finances
6.01      Since ANTEL's creation in 1963, its financial performance has
been satisfactory in terms of return on the rate base, but certain outside
factors combined with poor financial management led to liquidity problems
and inability to pay suppliers in 1967.  Since then, financial management
has improved substantially, as has the cash position. As of the end of
1970, ANTEL had a solid financial foundation for its expansion program.
Future earnings should continue to be satisfactory and cash generation
through the projecu period should be adequate.
Past Financial Performance
6.02      In 1967 there were two main reasons for ANTELts difficulties:
(a) price escalations in contracts for cables, caused mainly by unexpected
price increases for copper; and (b) a deterioration of accounts receivable
due to a change in billing procedures.
6.03      However, with increasing revenues after completion of the first
expansion project and improved financial management, the situation has been
corrected. In the past two years, ANTEL's financial position and liquidity
have been satisfactory. At the end of 1970, accounts receivable were down
to 48 days of annual revenues and all suppliers have now been paid.
6.04      Income statements for 1968-70 are shown in Annex 15; related notes
are in Annex 16, part A. Some salient features of ANTELts financial per-
formance in the past are given below.
1965    1966    1967    1968    1969    1970
Net Operating Income (million %) 2.0        1.9     2.7     5.1      5.0     5.8
Operating Ratio (%)                76       79      78      66       68      65
Rate of Return (%)                17.6      9.6     8.3    12.6    12.0    14.6
During the period 1965-1970 net operating income increased by 190% due to
system expansion, and the operating ratio improved from 76 to 65.  The rate
of return has been well above the required 9% except in 1967, when it declin-
ed to 8.3% due to an increase of assets of more than 40% in that year.
Present Financial Position
6.05      Balance sheets for 1968 through 1970 are shown in Annex 17.
Related notes are listed in Annex 16, part B. A summary of the audited
balance sheet as of December 31, 1970 is given below.

TOTAL LIABILITIES               50.8                20.3
6.06      Gross plant is stated at original cost and accounted for in
detailed plant registers.  Most of the assets were installed within the
past decade; since prices were reasonably stable during this period,
book values are realistic. Depreciation is computed for each class of
plant on a straight-line basis and reflects the lifetime of the equip-
ment. Current assets amounted to 08.6 million and current liabilities to
02.9 million--a ratio of 3 to 1, which gives AWTEL ample liquidity.  The
debt/equity ratio of 57/4.3 is satisfactory.
Auditing
6.07      ANTEL's accounts are subject to both internal and external audit.
Internal audit is exercised by the Court of Accounts, a governmental
institution, by continuously checking ANTEL's payments and receipts. Exter-
nal audit is done annually by independent commercial auditors.
6.08      The first accounts audited by independent auditors were those of
1967, but the audit was too limited to be acceptable to the Bank. However,
in November 1970 the Central Bank appointed the auditing firm of R. A.
Fernandez M. to undertake an extensive audit of ANTEL's 1969 and 1970
accounts. This audit was carried out during February - July 1971 and a copy
of the resulting auditors' report dated July 31, 1971, was sent to the Bank.
The report is acceptable.
6.09      Due to the absence of any extensive and proper audit since ANTEL's
creation in 1963, the auditors commented on various deficiencies in ANITEL's
accounting procedures and on various inaccuracies in its accounts, caused
mostly by insufficient internal control. They further commented on inadequate
control of assets and stores and suggested the regular taking of physical
inventories of ANTEL's assets and stores.



6.10      ANTEL should comply with the auditors' comments and suggestions,
and its accounts should continue to be audited annually by independent
auditors satisfactory to the Bank. The auditors' report together with
the audited statements should be sent to the Bank no later than four months
after the close of each fiscal year. Assurances on these matters were
obtained during negotiations.
CGovernment Bills
6.11      Under a special agreement ANTEL has been offsetting the charges
to Government for use of telecommunication services against the amortization
payments due from ANTEL to Government for the value of assets transferred
when ANTEL was formed in 1963. Government has not yet entered these repay-
ments in its books and should issue an executive order to properly record
these transactions. In addition Government should agree to pay for its
bills for use of telecommunication services after the value of transferred
assets is fully amortized sometime in 1972. During negotiations assurances
were obtained from Government that
(a) ANTEL's charges to Government for services rendered through
December 31, 1970 will be registered in Government's accounts
by corresponding set-offs against ANTELfs debt not later than
April 30, 1972;
(b) ANTEL's charges for services rendered during 1971 and up to
Mlarch 31, 1972 will be reviewed and registered in Government's
accounts by corresponding set-offs against the balance of
ANTEL's debt, if any, not later than June 30, 1972; and
(c) Charges for services rendered to Government after March 31, 1972
will be promptly set off by Government against any outstanding
balance of ANTEL's debt or paid in cash if ANTEL's debt has
been entirely set off.
Hospital
6.12      ANTEL is operating a hospital for its own and some other Government
staff. Revenues consist of contributions from ANTEL's staff and from
Government. In the past two years, while the revenues have remained at
the same level, hospital expenses have increased and this has caused deficits.
ANTEL has therefore proposed that the medical care of its staff be taken
over by the Government's social security system and that the hospital be
transferred to the Government.  Under the social security system ANTEL would
have to pay 8.25% of its payroll, which in 1972 would amount to about
06h3,000. Although ANTEL's continued administration of the hospital would
have no adverse effect on the project, it is an administrative burden that
does not justify the slightly lower expense for ANTEL. During negotiations
Government informed the Bank that it had decided to take over the hospital
and ANTEL had been asked to work out appropriate steps for the transfer.
Tariffs
6.13      ANTEL sets tariffs and other charges for its services, which are
introduced after approval of the Minister of Economics. The ANTEL Law provides



_ 15 -
for tariffs sufficient to cover, with a margin of safety, expenditures for
the operation, maintenance, development and expansion of its installations
and also its debt service. ANTEL's present tariffs, essentially unchanged
during the past ten years, are shown in Annex 18.
6.14     Wlhile the level of tariffs is adequate, the tariff structure has
several deficiencies. One is the manual long-distance rate, which is lower
than the automatic rate even for subscribers with access to automatic service,
although the operating cost of manual service is higher. A second is the
high fixed monthly charge, which is not conducive to development of the
network and even has caused stagnation in areas outside San Salvador. A
third deficiency is the excessive number of free calls, which contributes
to the present congestion in San Salvador.
6.15      The national telegraph operation runs with a large deficit.  In
1969, with revenues of only 0635,000, the deficit was about 02 million.
The main reason for this situation is the extremely low telegraph tariff
(a national telegram of eight words costs only US$0.08 and each additional
word only US$0.02).
6.16      In 1969 an ITU expert retained by ANTEL suggested a new tariff
schedule (see Annex 19) which would remove the structural defects of the
present tariffs. ANTEL has not yet taken any action on his recommendations.
During negotiations assurances were obtained that in consultation with the
Bank, ANTEL will henceforth review its tariffs on the basis of the suggested
new schedule with a view to introducing new tariffs no later than January 1,
1973.
Financing Plan
6.17      ANTEL's capital investment andadditionalworking capital require-
ments for the 1971-75 program period and the sources fram which they would
be met are summarized below. Forecasts of sources and applications of funds
are given in Annex 20.

- 16 -
Internal cash generation is projected at about 052 million and
takes into account the effect of the proposed new tariffs (paragraph 6.16).
Thus internal cash generation (net of debt service and contributions to
Government) is expected to contribute 40% of total requirements, which is
reasonable.
6.19      Contributions to Government would be made in accordance with the
ATTEL Law, which provides for surplus funds from ANTEL's operations --
after allowance for debt service, cash requirements and future expansion
of facilities -- to be transferred to Government.  Until recently ANTEL's
financial situation did not allow for such transfers. But since the
forecast of ANTEL's finances shows they will improve considerably with
accumulation of surplus cash, transfer to Government has been assumed in
1975.
6.20      Borrowings would contribute 60% of total requirements. The
proposed Bank loan of 023.8 million (US$9.5 million) would be for a period
of 20 years including a five-year grace period. For the financial project-
ions an interest rate of 7-1/4% has been assumed.
6.21      Apart from the CABEI loan, the terms of which are given in Annex
16, ANTEL contracted a short-term Central Bank loan of 06.2 million (US$2.5
million) at 6% for the purchase of urgent exchange equipment. However,
the loan's terms providing for repayment in 1973 and 1974 would impair
ANTEL's cash position and debt service coverage during the project period.
During negotiations assurances were obtained that Government will make
available to ANTEL the necessary funds required to maintain a reasonable
cash position and a sufficient debt coverage when repaying the above loans.
Accordingly, a Government loan of 02 million (US$0.8 million) at 6% has
been included in the financing plan.
Future Finances
6.22      Forecast income statements and balance sheets for 1971-76 are
given in Annexes 15 and 17; related notes are in Annex 16. A summary of
ANTELTs forecast financial results is given below.

- 17 -
6.23      The forecast financial results as summarized above are satisfactory.
The rate of return on net fixed assets would average 13% which is well above
the 9% required under Loan 358-ES. However, considering that ANTEL has now
completed the initial stages of development, ANTEL should be expected to
provide adequate earnings to ensure stable and continuous development in
future. Accordingly ANTEL should maintain revenues to achieve at least a
rate of return of 10% from 1972. In addition ANTEL should, when making
the structural adjustments of its tariffs (see paragraph 6.16), ensure
that during the construction period revenues are not substantially reduced
below the present level for each class of subscribers. Assurances to this
effect were obtained during negotiations.
6.24      Forecast balance sheets as of December 31, 1971, through December
31, 1976 (Annex 17) indicate that ANTEL's financial positinn will remain
sound. At the end of 1976 the debt/equity ratio would be 50/50, thus
leaving a fair margin for further borrowing. The current position through-
out the six-year period would be satisfactory.
6.25      Debt service coverage by internal cash generation would range
between 1.5 times in 1971 and 2.8 times in 1976. As under Loan 358-ES,
ANTEL should not incur long-term debt without the Bank's prior approval,
unless the preceding 12 months' internal cash generation would cover
maximum future debt service at least 1.5 times. Assurances to this effect
were again obtained during negotiations.

7. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
7.01      During loan negotiations, agreement was reached on the
following principal points:
(a)  ANTEL will employ engineering consultants acceptable to
the Bank (para 5.06);
(b)  Tariffs will be naintained to achieve a rate of return of
at least 10% (para 6.23); and
(c) No debt will be incurred unless debt service is covered
1.5 times by internal cash generation (para 6.25).
7.02      The proposed project constitutes a suitable basis for a
Bank loan of US$9.5 million, for a term of 20 years including a five
year grace period.

AJINISTRACION NACIONAL DE TELECCMUNIGACIONES (ANTEL)
Central American Microwave Network
ANTEL is participating in a project by the five Central American
countries to improve telecommunication services within the region. The
project comprises the installation of a high-capacity microwave system to
provide stable high-quality circuits between Guatemala, San Salvador
Tegucigalpa (Honduras), Managua (Nicaragua) and San Jose (Costa RicaS
with extension links to the Mexican border from Guatemala and the Panamanian
border from San Jose. The project also provides for the extension of the
national network in some countries.
A regional technical telecommunications commission (CCITELCA)
has been created and is responsible for the planning, installation, super-
vision and completion of this inter-Central American telecommunications
network. The President of ANTEL is one of the five directors of the
project.  San Jose, Costa Rica, is the headquarters of CMTELCA's
secretariat.
The project aims at providing a total of l,04O circuits to link
the five countries in Central America with each other and with Panama.,
Mexico and the United States.  The cost of the project is estimated to be
US$11.8 million, of which ANTEL's share is about US$2.7 million. San
Salvador will be provided with 196 circuits.  Initially,the circuits will
be operated manually, then semiautomatically. Automatic operation is
scheduled to be in effect by June 1973.
Tenders were called for the microwave equipment on an inter-
national basis and the contract was awarded to NJippon Electric Company
(NEC) of Japan at a cost of US$8.24 million. This cost includes not only
supply and installation of equipment but also civil works and training.
One engineer and five technicians are being trained in Costa Rica and
another group of trainees will be sent later. The courses are of six
months' duration. Two engineers will be trained in Japan.
The miorowave equipment has been commissioned on November 1, 1971.
It is expected that full-scale operations will commence by early April, 1972.
The international automatic exchange order has been placed with
Ericssons of Sweden and is scheduled to be completed by June 1973.

ADMINISTRACION NACIONAL DE TELECOMJNICACIONES (ANTEL)
Technical Consultants
Draft Terms of Reference
Administracion Nacional de Telecomunicaciones (ANTEL) is responsible
for the operation and management of all telecommunication services -- domestic
and international -- in the Republic of El Salvador.
The number of telephones now working in El Salvador totals about
38,000. The population is 3.4 million and the telephone density 1.1 telephones
per 100 persons. ANTEL has drawn up a telecommnications development program
(1971-75) to provide for about 26,000 telephones, the bulk of them in San
Salvador, the country's capital and business and administrative center, and
to improve and extend the long distance network. ANTEL has asked for a loan
from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development to finance a
project forming part of the program.
ANTEL has recently recruited several telecommunication engineers
(some have been sent abroad for training) to operate and maintain its exist-
ing facilities and those to be added under the 1971-75 program. These
engineers are not yet sufficiently experienced to plan, engineer, draw up
specifications, etc. Therefore, ANTEL has decided to retain technical
consultants and expects its engineers, by working with them, to gain enough
experience to handle future projects on their own.
The technical consultants will recommend suitable action to be
taken by ANTEL to complete the Bank project satisfactorily and will train
and assist ANTEL's engineers in planning, forecasting and project preparation.
Special attention will be given the following items, in the order of priority
listed:
(1) Preparation of specifications and of bid documents for equipment
to be obtained under the loan, and evaluation of bids.
(2) Preparation of installation and acceptance test schedules for
exchange and long distance equipment.
(3) Forecast of telephone demand in central office areas in San
Salvador and exchange areas in the rest of the country.
(4)  Forecast of intra/inter-central office, inter-urban and
international traffic.
(5) Cable planning and programming for all exchange areas.
(6) Central office equipment planning and programming to meet
anticipated growth.
(7) Long distance equipment planning and programming to meet growth,
and determining the types of equipment to be installed on various
routes.



ANNEX 9

(8) Preparation of a next stage development program of about five
years (1976-80) based on above items 3-7, working out the fund
requirements year-by-year, and drawing up specifications for
equipment to be obtained during that period.

Internal Financial Rate of Return
Project Period
1.        The internal financial return analysis is based on an assumed
project lifetime of 20 years.
2.        The residual value of the equipment has been calculated on the
basis of a lifetime of 20 years for exchange equipment, 30 years for cables
and 50 years for buildings. Thus the residual value for cables would be
1/3 of their original cost; the residual value for buildings would be 2/5
their cost.
Revenues
3.        Revenue estimates for 1971 and 1972 are based on existing tariffs.
As of 1973, revenue forecasts are related to the proposed tariffs (see Annex
19). For rental revenues the present distribution between business and
private subscribers has been used. Whereas rentals and installation charges
will be in direct proportion to the connections added, all the other telephone
revenues are projected to be lower for subscribers who are connected in later
years. No provision has been made for telegraph and telex revenues since no
related equipment would be financed under the project.
Costs
4.        Construction expenditure is project disbursement including provisions
for contingencies but excluding the cost of consultant services. Since ANTEL
is exempt from import duties, no corrections have been necessary.
5.        Because ANTEL is already over-staffed, salaries and wages have been
projected at about 1/2 the annual growth rate of connections, thus allowing
for a gradual reduction of the present staffing level after implementation
of the project. Other operating costs have been estimated in proporation
to the number of main subscriber lines. Depreciation has been excluded in
the cost stream.

'late of Return
6.        The internal financial return is 18.6%.
Sensitivity Analysis
7.        A sensitivity analysis gave the following results:
Rate of Return
10% increase in construction costs                 16.4%
10% increase in operating costs                    16.3%
10% increase in revenues                           23.5%
10% decrease in revenues                           13.9%
10% increase in operating costs and
10% decrease in revenues                           11.6%
With a conservative forecast of telephone revenues, the annual average
revenue per connection of 0451 in 1971 would decrease to about 0408 in
1976. A further decrease in average revenue per connection, as assumed in
the above analysis but considered unlikely, would still result in a rate
of return well above the opportunity cost of capital in El Salvador, which
is believed to be between 10% and 11%.

ADMINISTRACION NACION&L DE TELECOMUNICACIONES (ANTEL)
Notes and Assumptions on Financial Statements
A. Income Statements (Annex 15)
1. Installation charges: Revenues from 1971 are projected in
accordance with the annual number of new connections and the
tariff provisions assumed to prevail up to December 31, 1972.
From January 1, 1973, revenues are projected on the basis of
the tariff proposals shown in Annex 19.
2. Rentals in 1971 and 1972 include free urban call allowances
as well as revenues from public call offices, and are projected
on the basis of historical levels and annual connections. There-
after it is assumed that the new tariffs will exclude free call
allowances and rentals will accrue on the basis of an annual
average of %108 per connection.
3. Urban Telephone Revenues during 1971-1972 are included under
rentals (see para. 2). Thereafter these revenues are projected
separately and consequent to new tariffs as from January 1, 1973,
it is assumed that such revenues would increase by about 7% per
annum during 1973-1976.
4. Interurban Telephone Revenues are assumed to increase by 5% in
1971 and 10% in 1972 due to system expansion and unsatisfied
demand in 1972. Thereafter the same growth as for urban
revenues is assumed for interurban revenues (see para. 3).
5. International Telephone Revenues are assumed to increase by 5%
per year in 1971 and 1972. Due to expansion of the long distance
network and increase in new connections, revenues would increase
by 10% in 1973 and h0% in 1974. In 1975 there would be a return
to the historical growth rate of 5%.
6.  Telegraph Revenues from the national telegraph service are assumed
to remain constant at past levels.
7.  International Telegraph Revenues are assumed to grow at 4% per year.
8. MisceUlaneous Revenues During 1968-1970 these revenues consist
of charges for shifting connections and for repairing subscriber
apparatus, rent for leased lines, etc. It is assumed that the
fairly high revenues from such services (except the rent for leased
lines) will gradually decline following the improvement of service
conditions.



ANNEX 16
Page 2 of 2 pages
9. Salaries and Wages. An annual growth rate of 6% is assumed
except in 1971, when ANTEL raised its overall salary level
by 12%.
10. Materials and Services. Costs are assumed to follow the growth
rate of connections.
11.  COMTELCA Operational Costs.  These have been taken from the
feasibility study of the OC((TELCA scheme.
12. Depreciation. A composite annual rate of 5.5% is assumed as of
1971.
13. Net Other Income. A constant annual level of 0500 is assumed as
of 1971.
14. Net Hospital Operation. Net cost in 1971 is based on budget figures.
As of 1972, net cost is assumed to be 8.25% of the annual payroll,
which is the percentage applicable under the social security system
of El Salvador.
B. Balance Sheets (Annex 17)
1.  Fixed Assets during 1968-1970 have been taken from ANTEL's accounts.
Thereafter they are based on ANTEL's construction program.
2. Plant Under Construction as of 1971 is assumed to equal 50% of the
annual capital construction and the balance of works in progress
brought forward from the prior year.
3. Accounts Receivables during 1971-1975 are assumed to equal about 45
days' billings.
4. Inventories are projected to remain at the 1970 level of about J&0
per subscriber.
5. Current Liabilities are assumed to follow the growth rate of connections.
6. Equity consists entirely of retained earnings.
7. Long-term Debt as of December 31, 1971, is as follows:
a) Loan 358-ES (t19.587 million=US$7.8 million) outstanding;
b) Government loan of al.211 million, assumed to be fully repaid
by 1972;
c)  Local Bands in the amount of e2.061 million, assumed to be
fully redeemed in 1973;
d) An amount of 93.950 million, which represents disbursements
under a loan from the Central American Bank for Economic Inte-
gration (CABEI) for financing the El Salvador portion of the
CONTELCA network. The term of the loan is 14 years, including
three years grace, at 71A interest plus a conumiment charge of
3A of 1%.
