CREDIT 
SUMMARY 
Borrower: 
Serbia and 
Montenegro 
Amount: 
SDR 
58.7 
million 
(US$80 
million 
equivalent) 
Terms: 
Modified 
IDA 
terms 
with 
a 20-year 
maturity, 
including 
a  10-year 
grace 
period 
and 
no 
acceleration 
clause. 
Onlending 
to 
Serbia 
with 
the 
same 
terms. 
Objectives and 
Description: 
The 
proposed 
Second 
Private 
and 
Financial 
Sector 
Adjustment 
Credit 
(PFSAC 
11) 
will 
support 
the 
governments 
Serbia 
and 
Montenegro, 
and 
its 
largest 
constituent 
member 
state, 
Serbia, 
in 
the 
implementation 
of 
regulatory, 
institutional, 
and 
structural 
reforms 
seeking 
to 
significantly 
accelerate 
private 
sector-led 
growth 
through: 
(i) 
improving 
the 
business 
environment 
by 
means 
of 
comprehensive 
reform 
of 
enterprise 
entry, 
operation 
and 
exit; 
(ii) 
strengthening 
the 
financial 
system 
by 
privatizing 
andor 
liquidating 
majority 
state- 
owned 
banks 
and 
improving 
the 
environment 
under 
which 
banks 
and 
other 
financial 
intermediaries 
operate; 
and 
(iii) 
privatizing 
and 
restructuring 
socially-owned 
enterprises that 
crowd 
out 
private 
sector 
growth, 
hamper 
banking 
sector 
recovery, 
and 
incur 
significant fiscal 
and quasi-fiscal 
costs. 
Benefits: 
Risks: 
Implementation 
of 
continued 
reforms 
in 
the 
enterprise 
and 
financial 
sectors 
under 
this 
operation 
will 
enhance 
Serbia's  prospects 
for 
growth, 
and 
will 
reinforce 
the 
sustainability 
of 
its 
macroeconomic 
stabilization. 
The 
main 
benefit 
of 
the 
proposed 
credit 
would 
be 
the 
facilitation 
of 
faster 
private 
sector 
growth 
and 
job 
creation, supported 
by 
a 
healthier 
and 
more 
developed 
financial 
system. 
Overall 
enterprise 
and 
financial 
sector 
performance 
is 
expected 
to 
improve. 
This 
improvement 
may 
come 
partly 
through the 
sale 
of 
enterprises 
and  banks 
to 
local 
and 
foreign 
investors 
with 
strong 
management 
capacity, and 
partly 
through 
improved financial 
discipline 
as 
a 
result 
of 
more  proactive 
restructuring. 
Additionally, 
formation 
of 
new 
private 
sector 
firms 
is 
expected 
to 
accelerate 
in 
response 
to 
an 
improved 
business 
enabling 
environment 
and 
an 
increased 
supply 
of 
productive 
assets 
expected 
to 
be 
released 
from 
loss 
making 
firms 
as 
part 
of 
enterprise 
restructuring  efforts. 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
a 
well- 
functioning, 
properly 
regulated 
and  transparent 
financial 
system 
would 
allow 
an 
adequate 
mobilization 
of 
resources and 
their 
better 
allocation 
into 
productive 
investments needed 
by 
the 
private 
sector 
to 
modernize and 
expand 
their 
businesses. 
The 
operation 
faces 
three 
sets 
of 
risks. 
First, 
general 
political 
uncertainty 
related 
to 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
new 
constitutional 
arrangements 
in 
the 
union 
of 
Serbia 
and 
Montenegro 
and 
its 
constituent 
member 
states. 
This 
is 
compounded 
by 
the 
recent 
assassination 
of 
the 
Serbian 
Prime 
Minister, 
and 
the 
failure 
of 
two 
... 
111 
Page  4
rounds 
of 
the  Serbian 
presidential 
elections 
in 
late 
2002 
owing 
to 
insufficient 
voter  turnout. 
Second, 
consequently, 
the 
operation 
also 
faces 
a 
potential 
risk 
of 
weakening 
of 
political 
commitment 
to 
restructure, 
privatize 
and/or 
liquidate 
large  loss 
making 
enterprises 
and 
majority 
state-owned 
banks, 
many 
of 
which 
are 
politically/socially 
sensitive 
because 
of 
their 
importance 
to 
the 
economy 
as 
a 
whole 
and 
the 
potential 
social and 
fiscal 
costs. 
Finally, 
the 
worsening 
of 
global 
economic 
climate 
would 
pose 
a 
significant 
risk 
that 
could 
deter 
the 
potential private capital 
inflows 
to 
Serbia, 
affecting 
the 
success 
of 
enterprise 
and bank 
privatization. 
Schedule 
of 
Disbursements: 
The 
full 
credit 
is 
expected 
to 
be 
disbursed 
in 
two 
tranches 
of 
US$40 
million 
equivalent 
each.

1. 
This 
report 
constitutes 
the 
Program Document 
on 
a proposed Second 
Private 
and 
Financial 
Sector 
Adjustment 
Credit 
(PFSAC 
11) 
for 
Serbia and 
Montenegro 
(SAM)’ 
in 
the 
amount 
of 
SDR 
58.7 
million 
(US$SO 
million 
equivalent) 
to 
support 
Serbia’s 
sectoral 
reform 
program2. 
The 
Credit 
would 
be 
on 
modified 
International 
Development 
Association 
(IDA) 
terms, 
with 
a 
final 
maturity 
of 
20 years 
and 
a 
grace 
period 
of 
10 
years3, 
with 
no 
acceleration 
clause, 
and 
would 
be 
disbursed 
in 
two 
tranches. 
This 
report should 
also 
be 
read 
in 
conjunction 
with 
the 
Transitional 
Support Strategy 
Update 
(TSSU) 
of

World 
Bank 
Group 
(the 
Bank) 
for 
the 
Federal Republic 
of 
Yugoslavia 
(FRY)4. 
I. 
RECENT 
ECONOMIC 
DEVELOPMENTS 
2. 
SAM 
and 
Serbia began 
the 
delayed 
transition 
to 
democracy and a 
market economy 
under 
very 
difficult 
economic and social conditions. 
These 
conditions 
result 
from 
nearly 
four 
decades 
of 
inefficient 
economic 
management and a 
decade 
of 
regional conflicts 
and 
international isolation 
that 
followed 
the 
break-up 
of 
socialist Yugoslavia 
in 
1991. 
By 
2000, 
recorded 
per 
capita 
GDP 
had 
fallen 
to 
about one 
half 
of 
its 
1989 level, 
total 
public 
debt 
exceeded 130 
percent 
of 
GDP 
and 440 percent 
of 
exports, and 
inflation 
had 
surpassed 
1 
13 
percent. 
3. 
Despite 
these 
formidable 
odds, 
in 
less 
than 
two 
years, 
SAM 
and 
Serbia have taken 
impressive 
steps 
to 
address 
the 
daunting 
legacy 
of 
the past. 
The 
SAM 
and Serbian governments have 
followed 
a 
two- 
pronged 
approach 
combining 
stabilization 
measures 
with 
decisive 
steps 
in 
an 
agenda 
of 
structural 
reforms 
aimed  at 
initiating 
the  delayed transition. 
The 
authorities 
began 
their 
efforts 
toward 
stabilizing 
and 
reforming 
the 
economy 
in 
late-2000 
by 
tightening 
macroeconomic 
policies, 
first 
through 
their 
own 
efforts 
and later 
with 
the 
strong 
support 
of 
the 
international 
community. 
These 
policies 
were 
initially 
supported 
by 
an 
IMF 
program 
approved 
in 
December 
2000, 
and 
then 
by 
a Stand 
By 
Agreement 
of 
US$249 
million 
equivalent  approved 
in 
June 
2001. 
Subsequently, 
a three-year 
Extended 
Arrangement 
(EA) 
of 
US$829 
million 
equivalent 
was 
approved 
in 
May 
2002, 
spanning 
the 
period 
through end-March 
2005. 
4. 
Strong implementation 
of 
these 
reforms 
despite 
the 
remaining 
political 
uncertainties 
has 
brought 
initial 
macroeconomic stability, 
while laying 
the foundations 
for 
a sustained 
recovery 
and 
improved 
living 
standards 
(see 
Table 
1). 
The 
twelve-month 
inflation 
rate 
declined 
from 
113.5 
percent 
at 
end-2000 
to 
39 
percent 
at 
end 
2001, 
and 
further 
to 
14.2 
percent 
at  end-2002. 
The 
nominal 
Dinar 
exchange 
rate 
to 
Formerly 
known 
as 
“the 
Federal Republic 
of 
Yugoslavia” 
(FRY). 
The 
Constitutional 
Charter 
of 
Serbia 
and 
Montenegro 
was  enacted 
by 
the Parliament 
of 
Serbia, 
the 
Parliament 
of 
Montenegro and 
the 
Parliament 
of 
the 
Federal Republic 
of 
Yugoslavia effective 
February 
4, 
2003 
and, 
as 
of 
that 
date, 
the 
Federal Republic 
of 
Yugoslavia 
has 
changed 
its 
name 
to 
“Serbia 
and 
Montenegro.” 
In 
this 
document, 
all 
references 
to 
SAM 
which 
predate 
the 
change 
of 
name 
should 
be 
understood 
to 
refer 
to 
FRY. 
Due 
to 
the 
highly 
devolved 
nature 
of 
the 
SAM 
union 
(most 
areas 
of 
economic 
policy 
are 
in 
the 
competence 
of 
the 
member 
states) 
and 
the 
different 
starting 
points, 
needs 
and 
pace 
of 
reforms 
in 
the 
two 
member 
states, 
the 
Bank’s 
assistance 
program for 
SAM 
is 
being 
designed 
around 
member 
state-specific  operations. 
Therefore, 
for 
the 
purposes 
of 
this 
document, 
the 
term 
“Government” 
would 
designate 
the 
Government 
of 
Serbia, 
unless 
otherwise specified. 
Modified 
IDA 
terms 
for 
SAM 
were agreed 
by 
the 
Board 
in 
the 
context 
of 
the 
discussion 
of 
SAM’s 
membership 
and 
the 
Bank’s Transitional 
Support 
Strategy 
(TSS).

Real 
GDP 
growth 
rebounded 
from 
the 
highly 
negative 
rates 
of 
1999 
(impact 
of 
the 
Kosovo 
conflict) 
to 
positive 
rates 
of 
about 5-6 percent 
in 
2000 and 
2001. 
Preliminary 
results 
for 
2002 show that a 
growth 
rate 
of 
4 
percent 
has 
been 
reached. 
This 
growth 
rate 
had 
been 
supported 
by 
higher 
public 
investment  and 
greater 
levels 
of 
external 
budget 
support. 
Industrial 
production 
has 
been stagnant 
in 
200 
1, 
reflecting 
capacity 
constraints 
after 
years 
of 
isolation 
and 
the 
ongoing 
economic  restructuring. 
Recorded 
growth 
of 
industrial output 
for 
2002 
is 
1.7 
percent, 
with 
the 
total 
industrial 
output 
at 
the 
end 
of 
2002 
at 
only 
half 
of 
1991 output. 
Unemployment 
still 
remains 
very 
high, 
with 
the 
official 
recorded 
rate 
reaching 30 
percent 
in 
the 
first 
half 
of 
2002? 
6. 
With 
regard 
to 
foreign  trade, 
following 
a 
18.6 
percent increase 
(in 
US 
dollar 
terms) 
in 
2000, 
exports 
rose 
by 
7.7 
percent 
in 
2001 
and 
a 
further 
18.2 
percent 
in 
2002. 
Import growth 
has 
also 
remained 
high 
compared 
to 
2001, 
when 
the 
combination 
of 
rising 
donor 
support and restored trade contacts 
led 
to 
a 
growth 
of 
28.9 
percent. 
Total 
imports 
in 
2002 
were 
32.9 percent 
higher 
than 
in 
2001, 
reaching 
US$6.3 
billion. 
Since exports 
are 
so 
much 
smaller than imports, 
the 
trade balance 
deficit 
is 
also increasing, 
and 
As 
shown 
by 
the 
labor 
force 
surveys, 
the 
actual 
unemployment 
rate 
is 
probably 
much 
lower 
(around 
10-12 
percent) 
due 
to 
the 
presence 
of 
a 
large 
“shadow 
economy” 
in 
Serbia.

Page  9
reached 
US$4 
billion 
at 
the 
end 
of 
2002.6 
The 
current 
account 
deficit 
is 
projected 
for 
2002 
at 
around 
8.9 
percent 
of 
GDP. 
7. 
Thefiscal 
deficit 
(before 
official 
grants) 
increased 
from 
1 
percent 
of 
GDP 
in 
2000 
to 
an 
estimated 
5 
percent 
in 
2002, 
equivalent 
to 
US$782 
million. 
This 
is 
due 
to 
the 
more  realistic  budgeting 
of 
commitments 
(Le., 
lower 
accumulation 
of 
arrears), 
and 
some 
transition 
related 
expenditures, 
as 
well 
as 
recent 
increase 
in 
debt 
service payments. 
The 
deficit 
increase 
has 
been 
managed 
in 
a manner consistent 
with 
ongoing stabilization efforts 
due 
to 
the 
strong 
inflow 
of 
donor 
funding 
since 2000. 
8. 
In 
parallel 
to 
stabilization 
efforts, 
the 
SAM 
and Serbian governments 
took 
the 
first 
steps 
in 
an 
agenda 
of 
structural 
and 
institutional 
reforms 
aimed 
at 
initiating 
the 
delayed 
transition. 
In 
addition 
to 
resolute enterprise 
and 
banking 
sector 
measures 
supported 
under 
the 
first 
PFSAC 
(see 
Sections 
I11 
and 
IV 
of 
this 
report),  substantial progress was recorded 
in 
reform 
areas 
supported 
by 
the 
Bank 
through 
the 
first 
Structural Adjustment 
Credit 
(SAC), 
disbursed 
in 
early 
2002, 
and 
the 
Social 
Sector 
Adjustment Credit 
(SOSAC), 
currently 
under 
implementation, 
and 
related technical 
assistance 
projects: improvements 
in 
the 
transparency 
of 
public 
expenditure 
management; 
taxation 
reform; 
major 
increases 
in 
electricity 
prices7; 
reforms 
to 
improve 
the 
flexibility 
of 
labor 
markets; pension 
reform; 
and 
initial 
legal 
and 
judicial 
reforms 
backed 
by 
an anti-corruption 
strategy 
for 
improving 
governance and 
institutions. 
Medium-Term 
Prospects 
and 
External 
Financing 
Requirements 
9. 
Growth 
prospects. 
Robust 
growth 
in 
2000 
to 
2002 
was 
primarily 
driven 
by 
one-off 
rebounds 
from 
earlier 
shocks. 
Under 
the 
assumption 
of 
continued 
decisive 
stabilization 
and 
reforms 
and 
substantial 
support 
from 
donors and creditors, 
real 
output 
is 
expected 
to 
grow 
at a 
slightly 
lower 
but 
more 
sustainable 
annual rate 
of 
around 
4 
percent 
beginning 
in 
2003. 
Near-term 
growth 
is 
expected 
to 
be 
driven 
by 
exports, 
a 
more 
vibrant 
SME 
sector, 
improved 
balance 
in 
the 
energy 
sector, 
and  greater 
donor 
financing 
of 
investments. 
These 
factors are expected 
to 
outweigh 
the 
contractionary near-term 
impact 
of 
further 
fiscal 
adjustment 
and 
the 
remaining transitional 
recession. 
Medium-term 
growth 
will 
also 
be 
driven 
by 
greater 
productivity 
and 
enhanced 
financial 
intermediation, 
the 
entry 
of 
new 
firms, 
infrastructure 
rehabilitation 
and 
investments 
in 
new 
productive 
capacity. 
10. 
Fiscal 
prospects. 
The 
limited 
domestic 
sources 
of 
budget 
financing 
and 
the 
reduction 
in 
external 
financing 
to 
more 
sustainable 
levels 
will 
require 
a 
phased 
reduction 
in 
fiscal deficits. 
Counterpart 
funding 
from 
the 
Bank 
and other 
donors 
will 
work 
to 
ensure 
that 
the 
overall 
fiscal 
adjustment 
is 
not 
excessively 
abrupt. 
Despite 
a 
large 
increase 
in 
public 
debt 
service payments and the 
continued 
bringing 
on 
budget 
of 
quasi-fiscal activities, 
the 
consolidated 
fiscal 
deficit 
(excluding 
official 
grants) 
will 
decrease 
slightly 
from 
5.0 
percent 
of 
GDP 
in 
2002 
to 
3.9 
percent 
in 
2005.' 
Deficit 
reductions 
in 
the outer 
years 
will 
be 
supported 
by 
a 
leveling 
off 
of 
debt 
service payments, 
deeper 
savings 
resulting 
from 
reforms, 
and 
improvements 
in 
tax 
administration. 
While 
cash 
outlays 
will 
decline 
by 
around 
3.0 
percentage 
points 
of 
GDP 
from 
2002 
to 
' 
Foreign 
trade 
and 
current 
account 
data 
are 
presented 
for 
SAM. 
The 
price 
of 
electricity 
was 
increased 
from 
US 
cents 
0.9lkWh 
in 
late 
2000 
to 
an 
average 
of 
US 
cents 
1 
.GIkWh 
in 
late 2001 
and 
US 
cents 
3.2 
in 
July 
2002. Further 
upward 
adjustments 
are 
envisioned, 
reaching 
around 
US 
cents 
4.0 
cents 
in 
2003. 
'As 
shown 
in 
Table 
1, 
the 
2003 
consolidated 
budget 
envisages 
a 
significant 
reduction 
in 
budgetary expenditures 
as 
a 
share 
of 
GDP. 
This 
is 
being 
driven 
by 
reductions 
in 
three categories 
of 
Serbian 
budgetary 
expenditures 
which 
the 
recent 
Public 
Expenditure 
and 
Institutional 
Review 
(PEIR) 
identified 
as 
relatively 
high 
by 
regional 
standards 
- 
(i) 
subsidies, 
(ii) 
transfers 
to 
households, 
and 
(iii) 
wages 
and 
salaries. 
As 
noted 
in 
the 
PEIR, 
these 
reductions 
are 
needed 
to 
align overall 
expenditure commitments 
with 
available 
non-inflationary 
sources 
of 
financing. 
As 
debt 
service 
is 
being 
regularized 
following 
the 
non-servicing 
of 
debt 
during 
most 
of 
the 
1990s, 
these 
shifts 
in 
the 
composition 
of 
expenditures 
are 
also needed 
to 
facilitate 
the 
resulting 
increase 
in 
interest 
payments 
on 
public 
debt. 
4 
Page  10
2005, 
the 
program 
also 
achieves 
additional 
cuts 
in 
expenditure commitments  and 
hidden 
quasi-fiscal 
deficits, 
with 
the 
biggest 
direct 
impacts 
coming 
from 
pension, 
energy 
and 
banking 
reforms. 
11. 
Exports 
of 
goods 
and 
services 
(in 
US 
dollars) 
are 
expected 
to 
grow 
by 
23 
percent 
in 
2003, 
before 
falling 
to 
a 
more 
sustainable 
but 
still 
high 
10 
percent 
in 
2005. 
In 
later 
years, 
export 
recovery 
could 
be 
supported 
by 
a 
rebound 
in 
the economies 
of 
key 
partners, 
deepened 
trade 
integration (including through 
the 
EU 
Stabilization 
and 
Association 
and 
World 
Trade 
Organization 
accession 
processes), 
rehabilitation 
of 
infrastructure, 
productivity 
improvements, and 
higher 
foreign direct 
investment. 
12. 
SAM’s 
current 
account deficit 
(including 
grants) 
is 
expected 
to 
decline 
from 
8.9 
percent 
of 
GDP 
in 
2002 
to 
around 
6.6 
percent 
in 
2005. 
These 
high 
levels 
reflect 
a structural imbalance 
between 
a 
low 
savings 
rate, 
and 
increased 
investment 
needs 
following 
a 
decade 
of 
underinvestment. 
Gross domestic 
investment 
as 
a 
share 
of 
GDP 
is 
expected 
to 
rise 
from 
16.1 
percent 
in 
2002 
to 
17.8 
percent 
in 
2005. 
In 
parallel, 
and 
supported 
by 
public 
sector  saving, 
a 
strengthened 
banking 
system,. 
and 
an increase 
in 
enterprise 
profitability, 
gross 
domestic savings 
will 
increase 
from 
-7.0 
percent 
of 
GDP 
in 
2002 
to 
0.6 
percent 
in 
2005. 
In 
the 
early 
years, 
donor 
grant 
funding 
will 
play 
a 
significant 
role 
in 
closing 
the 
gap 
between 
national 
savings 
and 
investment 
needs. 
13. 
Financing 
needs. 
To 
achieve 
this 
macroeconomic 
scenario 
and 
finance 
the 
transition 
to 
a 
market 
economy, 
the 
union 
and 
Serbia 
will 
require 
substantial 
capital 
inflows. 
Even 
following 
the 
restructuring 
of 
Paris 
Club 
debt 
and  a 
sharp  increase 
in 
dollar 
GDP 
in 
2001 
and 
2002 
(largely 
driven 
by 
real 
appreciation 
from 
the 
highly 
depreciated 
level 
of 
late-2000), 
SAM’s 
external 
debt 
remained a 
very 
high 
75 
percent 
of 
GDP 
at  end-2002. 
Between 
2003 
and 
2005, 
gross 
external 
financing 
requirements 
(excluding 
for 
debt 
rescheduling)  are estimated at about 
US$7.9 
billion. 
These 
resources 
are 
needed 
to 
finance 
US$4.4 
billion 
of 
current 
account 
deficits (excluding 
interest 
and 
official 
transfers), 
US$1.2 
billion 
in 
increased 
international 
reserves, 
and 
the 
remainder 
of 
US$2.3 
billion 
to 
fulfill 
net 
debt service 
obligations. 
During 
this 
period, 
as 
the 
fiscal 
deficit 
is 
increasingly 
brought 
under 
control, 
these 
needs 
will 
shift 
from 
the 
budgetary 
sector 
to 
the 
private 
sector. 
14. 
Financing 
sources. 
These 
needs are 
projected 
to 
be 
met 
from 
several 
sources. 
With 
good 
progress 
on 
reforms, 
foreign 
direct 
investment 
and 
other 
private 
sector 
finance 
will 
grow 
to 
total 
around US$4.3 
billion 
during 
this 
three 
year 
period. 
The 
remaining US$3.6 
billion 
of 
financing 
during 
this 
period 
will 
come 
from official 
bilateral 
and 
multilateral 
sources. 
The 
Bank 
program 
generally, 
and 
the 
proposed 
adjustment operations 
more 
specifically, 
would 
represent 
a 
significant 
share 
of 
this 
financing,  and 
can 
thus 
play 
a 
crucial 
role 
in 
helping 
to 
ensure 
adequate 
financing 
for 
the 
reform 
programs 
in 
Serbia. 
15. 
Assuming 
debt 
relief 
on 
appropriate 
terms, 
debt  service 
indicators 
are 
expected 
to 
decline 
significantly 
to 
still 
high 
levels. 
SAM’s 
total 
external debt 
is 
expected 
to fall 
further 
to 
50 
percent 
of 
GDP 
in 
2005, 
driven 
by 
further debt 
relief 
and 
some 
additional 
real 
appreciation. 
SAM’s 
ability to 
maintain 
a 
relatively 
stable 
ratio 
of 
debt 
to GDP 
despite 
relatively 
large 
current 
account 
deficits, 
will 
initially 
be 
facilitated 
by 
the 
high 
degree 
of 
average concessionality 
of 
official 
external  financing, 
and 
later 
by 
increasing 
inflows 
of 
private 
capital. 
The 
ratio 
of 
total 
debt 
service 
to 
exports 
would 
fluctuate 
in 
the 
range 
of 
12-17 percent 
in 
the 
period 
2003-2005, 
and 
reach 
a 
level 
of 
around 
20 
percent 
in 
the 
medium-term.

performance, 
confirmed 
the 
overall 
approach, 
and 
laid 
out 
the 
Bank's

for 
FY03. 
The 
World

assist 
the 
Government 
in 
achieving 
its 
overall 
goals 
of: 
(i) 
restoring 
macroeconomic 
stability 
and 
external 
balance; 
(ii) 
stimulating 
near-term 
growth 
and creating the 
basis 
for 
a sustained 
supply 
response; 
(iii) 
improving 
the 
social 
well-being 
of 
the 
most 
vulnerable and 
building 
human 
capacity; 
and 
(iv) 
improving 
governance 
and 
building 
effective 
institutions. 
As 
of 
May 
8, 
2003, 
nine 
IDA 
credits 
totaling 
US$297.01

interim 
PRSP9 
for 
SAM 
clearly 
recognizes that 
an 
effective 
strategy 
for 
fighting poverty 
requires 
a 
multi-sectoral 
approach that  fosters 
policies 
consistent 
with 
an 
agreed 
macroeconomic 
framework. 
Within 
these 
parameters, 
the 
Bank 
and 
other 
donors have 
noted 
the 
central 
role 
that 
the 
SAM 
authorities 
have 
given to growth 
and 
economic  development 
in 
their  poverty  reduction 
strategy. 
In 
turn, 
both 
private 
and 
financial 
sector 
development 
reforms 
are 
regarded 
as 
hndamental pillars 
to 
the 
promotion 
of 
growth, employment creation, 
and 
more 
broadly 
to 
the 
establishment 
of 
an 
adequate 
business 
enabling 
environment 
that 
would 
make 
early 
reform 
efforts 
more sustainable. 
The 
well 
defined 
reform 
agenda 
of 
the 
Serbian 
authorities 
in 
the 
private 
and 
financial 
sector, 
which 
is 
supported 
by 
the 
PFSAC 
program, 
reinforces 
the 
fact that 
poverty reduction involves 
the 
synergies 
of 
savings, 
investments, and 
technology combined 
to 
produce 
jobs. 
The 
combination 
of 
these 
factors 
happens 
while firms 
enter 
the 
market 
and 
grow 
without 
barriers, 
or 
exit 
efficiently 
so 
that 
their 
salvageable 
assets 
can 
be 
used 
again 
for 
productive 
purposes and 
so 
that 
they 
no 
longer 
crowd 
out more 
productive 
new 
firms. 
It 
is 
this 
context, 
and 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
initial 
TSS 
for 
SAM, 
that 
the 
authorities' early 
reform 
program 
in 
the 
private 
and 
financial 
sectors sought 
to 
address 
the 
immediate 
challenges 
of 
Serbia's 
long-delayed structural 
reform 
agenda 
in 
banks and enterprises. 
These 
included 
the 
resolution 
of 
large 
insolvent 
state 
banks, 
start 
of 
a 
multi- 
track 
privatization 
program, 
and 
early 
efforts to  improve 
the 
regulatory framework 
for 
banking 
and 
enterprise 
sectors. 
Based 
on 
the 
Government's strong performance 
in 
these 
areas 
during 
2001 
and 
the 
first 
half 
of 
2002, 
a first 
PFSAC 
was 
approved 
by 
the 
Board 
in 
May 
2002, and 
hlly 
disbursed 
in 
a 
single 
tranche 
shortly 
thereafter. 
In 
the 
context 
of 
the 
Letter 
of 
Development 
Policy 
(LDP) 
for 
the 
first 
PFSAC, 
the 
Government 
of 
Serbia 
and 
the 
Bank 
agreed 
upon 
an 
envisioned 
framework 
of 
medium-term reforms 
that 
would 
constitute 
the 
basis 
of 
a 
follow 
up PFSAC 
11. 
The 
proposed operation 
thus 
builds 
on 
the 
impressive 
progress 
made 
under 
the 
first 
PFSAC 
by 
supporting 
the 
continuation 
of 
a 
wide-ranging 
privatization 
and 
restructuring program 
for 
majority 
state- 
and 
socially-owned 
enterprises 
and banks. 
Furthermore, 
the 
proposed 
credit 
supports the 
Government's 
longer-term 
reform 
agenda 
aimed 
at 
creation 
of 
a 
modem 
regulatory 
and 
institutional 
framework 
for 
sustainable 
private 
and 
financial 
sector 
development. 
17. 
The 
proposed 
PFSAC 
I1 
is 
part 
of 
the 
ongoing 
Bank 
program 
with 
the 
authorities 
of 
Serbia 
to 
support 
enterprise 
sector 
reforms 
that  foster 
private 
sector 
growth 
and 
job 
creation, 
facilitated 
by 
a 
healthier and 
more 
developed 
financial 
system. 
Initial 
reforms 
in 
the 
financial 
and 
enterprise 
sectors 
had 
been 
supported under 
the 
first 
PFSAC 
I 
(US$85 
million 
equivalent)" 
(see 
Box 
1). 
As 
noted 
above, 
Serbia 
has 
moved 
swiftly 
on 
the 
fiscal 
and 
poverty 
reform 
agendas, 
supported 
under 
the 
first 
SAC 
and, 
more 
recently, 
the 
SOSAC. 
Complementary 
to 
this 
agenda, 
it 
is 
critical 
to 
the 
sustainability 
of 
the 
overall 
reform 
program 
that 
the Government 
continues 
to 
devote 
equal attention 
to 
reform 
of 
real 
and 
financial 
sectors.

Links 
to 
objectives 
and medium-term 
agenda 
of 
PFSAC 
I. 
As 
noted 
in 
Box 
1, 
the successful 
implementation 
of 
policy 
objectives 
presented 
in 
PFSAC 
I 
provided 
an 
adequate 
platform for 
the 
design 
of 
PFSAC 
11. 
While 
the 
detailed 
descriptions 
of 
recent progress made 
by 
the 
Government 
in 
financial 
and 
enterprise  sector 
reforms 
are 
presented 
later 
in 
this 
report 
under 
specific 
components, 
it 
should 
be 
emphasized 
from 
the 
onset 
that 
there 
is 
a large 
degree 
of 
consistency 
in 
the 
way PFSAC 
I1 
conditionality 
and 
objectives have 
followed 
the 
medium-term 
agenda 
that 
was 
laid 
out 
in 
PFSAC 
I. 
In 
particular, 
the 
following 
linkages 
deserve 
a special 
mention: 
0 
Banking 
sector 
reform. 
The 
authorities 
have 
largely 
fulfilled 
their 
objective 
to 
carry 
on 
with 
the 
resolution program 
of 
troubled 
majority 
state-owned banks 
that 
was 
initiated 
under 
PFSAC 
I. 
All 
of 
the 
banks 
which 
were 
under 
the 
control 
of 
the 
Bank 
Rehabilitation 
Agency 
have 
been 
dealt 
with 
diligently 
and 
most 
of 
them 
are 
candidates 
for 
the 
newly 
prepared 
bank 
privatization 
program 
supported 
by 
PFSAC 
11; 
independent 
governance arrangements have 
been 
established 
for 
all 
state 
banks; 
and, 
the 
overall 
objective 
of 
privatizing 
all 
state-run  banks 
remains 
an 
ultimate 
goal 
that 
is 
now 
supported 
by 
core 
conditions 
under 
PFSAC 
11. 
However, 
with 
hindsight, 
some 
of 
the 
timeframes that 
were 
presented 
as 
medium 
term 
targets 
in 
PFSAC 
I 
have 
proven 
to 
be 
unrealistic. 
This 
is 
particularly 
true 
if 
one 
takes 
into 
account 
recent 
developments 
that 
have considerably 
increased 
the 
number 
of 
majority 
state-owned banks 
that 
are 
expected 
to 
be 
put 
for 
sale 
over 
the 
coming 
months 
by 
the 
Serbian 
authorities 
(see 
section 
V.A 
for 
more 
details). 
As 
far 
as 
the 
objectives 
to 
redefine 
the 
mechanisms 
of 
bank 
resolution 
and 
establish 
a 
functioning 
deposit  insurance 
scheme 
are concerned, 
these 
remain part 
of 
the 
program, 
yet 
revamping them 
while 
the 
agenda 
of 
bank 
privatization 
is 
only 
starting 
to 
get 
underway 
has 
proven 
to 
be 
impractical. 
0 
Financial 
sector 
regulatory 
and 
supervisory 
framework. 
Further strengthening 
of 
banking 
prudential 
and 
supervisory 
framework 
have been 
actively 
pursued 
by 
the 
Serbian 
authorities 
and 
remain 
a 
central 
part 
of 
the 
program. 
In 
this 
regard, 
the 
envisioned  central 
objective 
of 
PFSAC 
I 
which 
called 
for 
the preparation 
a Supervisory 
Development 
Plan 
was 
successfully 
met, 
and 
the 
implementation 
of 
this 
plan 
is 
a 
clearly defined 
road 
map 
to 
the 
conditions 
and 
objectives 
in 
PFSAC 
11. 
0 
Reform 
of 
socially-owned  enterprises. 
The 
Government 
has 
maintained 
its 
efforts 
to 
implement 
the 
tender 
privatization 
component 
of 
the 
program. However, 
the 
estimate 
that 
200 
large 
enterprises 
could 
be 
sold through 
this 
method 
has 
proven unrealistic 
because 
quality 
of 
the 
companies 
has 
been 
lower 
than 
expected. 
As 
envisaged 
under 
PFSAC 
I, 
amendments 
were 
passed 
to 
the 
Privatization 
Law 
and  the  Decree 
on 
Auctions 
to 
further 
strengthen 
the 
Government’s 
authority over 
the 
privatization 
process 
and 
to 
prevent 
the 
managing bodies 
in 
socially-owned 
companies 
from 
obstructing 
it. 
These 
amendments have 
incorporated 
lessons 
from 
the 
initial 
implementation 
period 
of 
auctions, 
tenders 
and 
restructuring. 
Furthermore, 
as 
part 
of 
the 
package 
to 
amend 
the 
Privatization Law, 
the 
government 
addressed 
the 
issue 
of 
assumption 
of 
liabilities 
for 
past 
environmental 
damages. 
Parallel 
to 
tender 
privatizations, 
progress 
in 
the 
auctions 
program 
exceeded expectations. 
By 
end-2002, 
some 
500 
companies 
were 
sold 
in 
contrast 
to 
only 
100 
enterprises 
originally 
envisaged. 
Finally, 
the 
authorities 
have 
made 
significant 
progress 
in 
building 
the 
institutional 
capacity 
for 
implementation 
of 
pre- 
7 
Page  13
privatization 
restructuring 
of 
large, 
heavily 
indebted 
industrial 
conglomerates. 
Finaiicial 
advisors 
for 
approximately 
30 
conglomerates have been 
engaged, 
and 
the 
Government’s 
Social 
Program 
has 
been 
utilized 
to 
finance 
severance 
payments 
to 
redundant 
workers. 
0 
Reform 
of 
business 
environment. 
The 
authorities have also made substantial progress 
toward 
creating 
a 
modern 
business 
environment 
in 
Serbia, 
and 
PFSAC 
I1 
conditions 
present 
a 
consistent 
continuation 
of 
actions  and 
objectives 
which 
were 
presented 
in 
PFSAC 
I. 
Specifically, 
the 
authorities 
developed 
the 
drafts 
of 
several 
key 
laws 
and 
regulations 
aimed 
at 
creating 
an 
efficient 
entry, 
operation 
and 
exit 
framework 
for 
enterprises. 
The 
Government 
has 
been 
very 
keen 
on 
establishing  a 
functioning 
consultation 
mechanism 
to 
ensure 
the 
participation 
of 
entrepreneurs  and  other 
relevant 
stakeholders 
in 
the 
design 
of 
business 
environment 
reforms. 
Finally, 
work 
has 
progressed 
on 
SME 
development 
and 
FDI 
promotion 
strategies, 
with 
specially 
designated 
agencies 
established 
by 
the 
Government 
to 
implement 
these 
strategies.

Objectives 
and 
structure 
of 
PFSAC 
II. 
The 
overall 
objective 
of 
the 
PFSAC 
I1 
is 
to 
support 
the 
Government’s 
program 
of 
regulatory,  institutional, 
and 
structural  reforms 
seeking 
to 
significantly 
accelerate 
private 
sector-led 
growth 
through: 
(i) 
improving 
the 
business 
environment 
by 
means 
of 
comprehensive 
reform 
of 
enterprise 
entry, 
operation 
and 
exit; 
(ii) 
strengthening 
the 
financial 
system 
by 
improving 
the 
environment 
under 
which 
banks and other 
financial 
intermediaries 
operate; 
(iii) 
privatizing 
and/or 
liquidating 
outdated 
majority 
state-owned  banks 
that 
fail 
to 
fulfill 
their 
role 
of 
financial 
intermediaries; 
and 
(iv) 
privatizing 
and 
restructuring 
socially-owned 
enterprises 
that 
crowd 
out 
private 
sector 
growth,  hamper 
banking 
sector  recovery,  and 
incur  significant  fiscal 
and 
quasi-fiscal 
costs. 
Accordingly, 
the 
proposed 
credit 
will 
be 
conditioned 
on 
specific 
reform 
measures 
in 
the 
following 
four 
areas, 
which 
are 
also consistent 
with 
the 
priority 
objectives 
of 
the 
Bank’s 
TSSU:

would  aim 
to 
improve 
the 
regulatory

framework 
for

through 
improving 
the

system; 
to 
facilitate 
efficient 
operations 
of 
business 
through 
reforming 
the 
Enterprise 
Law, 
building 
institutional 
capacity 
for 
regulatory 
reform,  and 
improving 
enterprises’ 
access 
to 
finance;  and 
reducing 
barriers 
to 
the 
efficient 
exit 
and 
redeployment 
of 
non-productive 
assets.

sectors, 
laying 
out 
the 
foundation 
for 
the 
future

and 
local 
investors 
using 
internationally 
accepted

It 
is 
proposed 
that 
the 
funds 
be released 
in 
two 
tranches 
separated 
by 
a 
period 
of 
nine 
to 
12 
months. 
A 
two-tranche 
design 
would 
allow 
the 
Bank 
to 
provide 
the 
much-needed 
support 
in 
a 
timely

manner, 
while

program 
in 
the

Current 
Status. 
Notwithstanding 
the 
Yugoslav 
legacy 
of 
social 
ownership,  Serbia’s 
private 
entrepreneurial 
energy 
is 
among 
its 
greatest 
assets 
for 
economic 
recovery 
and 
has 
already 
contributed 
significantly 
to 
growth. 
The 
private 
sector, 
including 
the 
informal 
sector accounted 
for 
two 
thirds 
of 
GDP 
by 
2001, 
although 
it 
employed 
less 
than 
10 
percent 
of 
capital. 
Registered 
small 
and 
medium 
enterprises 
(SMEs) 
employed 
about 
590,000 
workers 
in 
Serbia 
by 
end-2001, 
or 
about 
43 
percent 
of 
all 
formal 
employment.” 
A 
very 
large 
informal 
economy 
has 
emerged, 
accounting 
for 
perhaps 
one-third 
of 
GDP, 
and 
employing 
as 
many 
as 
one 
million 
workers, 
equal 
to 
30 
percent 
of 
the 
labor force. 
By 
all 
measures, 
the 
private 
sector 
is 
far 
more 
efficient 
and 
profitable 
than 
firms 
under 
state, 
mixed 
or 
social ownership. 
23. 
Over 
the 
past 
two 
years, 
the 
SAM 
and  Serbian governments, 
assisted 
by 
the 
Bank 
and other 
donors, have made progress 
toward 
business 
enabling 
reforms, 
including 
liberalization 
and deregulation 
of 
foreign 
trade  and  investment, 
simplification 
of 
the 
tax 
regime, 
and 
modernization 
of 
the 
labor 
legislation. However, 
recent 
surveys 
indicate that 
Serbia’s 
administrative 
and 
regulatory environment 
continues 
to 
be 
hostile 
to 
private 
business 
start-up 
and 
expansion, 
as 
witnessed 
by 
the 
lingering 
presence 
of 
a large 
informal 
sector. 
The 
recent 
Joint 
WB-IMF 
Staff 
Assessment 
of 
the 
FRY-I-PRSP 
underscores 
that “reforms

Government’s 
agenda 
is 
focused 
on 
further 
upgrading 
the 
legal 
foundations 
and 
institutional 
capacity 
for 
a 
sound 
business 
environment. 
Through 
its 
implementation 
the 
Government 
hopes 
to 
achieve 
the 
following 
objectives: 
(i) 
promote 
sustainable 
economic 
growth 
and enabling 
private 
sector 
employment 
opportunities 
with 
a special focus 
on 
SMEs; 
(ii) 
create 
a 
level playing 
field 
between 
the 
existing 
state- 
and 
socially-owned 
enterprise sector 
and 
the 
new private 
sector; 
and 
(iii) 
develop 
an 
environment 
where 
the 
rule 
of 
law 
is 
respected, 
property 
rights 
and 
claims 
are 
recognized, 
economic 
agents 
can 
have 
access 
to 
capital, 
and 
lenders 
feel 
secure. 
To 
this 
end, 
the 
PFSAC 
I1 
will 
support  Government’s 
priority 
reforms 
to: 
(i) 
remove 
administrative 
and 
legislative 
barriers 
to 
entry; 
(ii) 
facilitate 
efficient 
operations 
of 
business 
through 
reforming 
the 
Enterprise 
Law, 
building 
institutional 
capacity 
for 
regulatory 
reform 
and 
improving 
enterprises’ 
access 
to 
finance; 
and 
(iii) 
reduce 
barriers 
to 
the 
efficient 
exit 
and 
redeployment 
of 
non-productive 
assets.

This 
is 
partly 
due 
to 
the 
lack 
of 
clear 
constitutional framework 
before 
the 
recent 
changes 
in 
the 
powers 
of 
the 
SAM 
and 
Serbian governments 
has 
been 
introduced. 
Slow 
progress 
is 
also 
partly 
due 
to 
lack 
of 
institutional 
capacity 
in 
the 
Government, 
with 
an 
over-worked 
cadre 
of 
reformers 
dealing 
with 
a 
wide 
array 
of 
other 
reforms 
such 
as 
SOE 
privatization 
and 
restructuring.

Business 
entry. 
Serbia 
needs 
a 
better 
business 
registration 
system 
to 
promote 
development 
of 
the 
private 
sector. 
This 
puts 
Serbia at 
a 
clear 
disadvantage. 
The 
Government  launched 
a 
comprehensive 
reform 
of 
business 
registration 
at 
the end 
of 
2002 
and plans 
to 
complete the 
reform 
by 
the end 
of 
2003. 
The 
Government’s  objective 
is 
to 
reduce 
the number 
of 
days 
and 
costs 
needed 
to 
register 
an 
enterprise. 
The 
structure 
for 
a 
proposed 
new 
registration 
system, 
developed 
with 
the support 
of 
the 
Bank, converges 
with 
good 
European 
practices 
and aims 
to: 
(i) 
create a 
unified 
Serbian 
business 
register that includes 
all 
business 
activities 
covered under the  current Enterprise 
Law 
and 
Law 
on 
Private 
Entrepreneurs; 
(ii) 
administer 
the 
new 
unified 
registry through 
an independent 
administrative 
agency; 
(iii) 
allow 
businesses 
to 
start 
activities  immediately 
after 
registration; 
(iv) 
streamline 
data 
requirements 
for 
each  class 
of 
business 
according 
to 
European 
Union 
(EU) 
benchmarks; 
(v) 
expand electronic 
registration 
and updating, 
and 
ensure  easy 
electronic  accessibility 
to 
the 
database;  and, 
(vi) 
create  a 
single 
unique 
identifying 
number 
for 
each enterprise 
that 
would 
serve 
all 
government 
needs. 
The 
system 
will 
be 
administered 
by 
an 
independent 
expert 
agency 
that 
is 
committed 
to 
supporting the 
needs 
of 
businesses 
and 
is 
accountable 
to 
the 
Government 
for 
delivering 
information 
of 
a 
timeliness 
and 
quality 
to 
serve 
public 
needs 
such 
as 
inspections. 
The 
Business Services 
Agency 
would 
administer the 
business 
registry 
and 
other 
registries 
as 
appropriate. 
Once 
it 
is 
fully 
operational,  the 
new 
business 
registration 
system 
should 
be 
self-financing, 
and 
preliminary 
cost 
and 
revenue 
estimates 
suggest 
this 
is 
feasible. 
Box 
2: 
Public 
Consultation 
Process 
in 
Serbia 
To 
facilitate a 
more active 
role 
of 
the 
private 
sector 
in 
institutional 
and 
regulatory 
reforms, 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Economy 
and 
Privatization 
established 
an 
SME Advisory Board 
with 
14 
business 
members. 
Another 
important 
step 
in 
the 
direction 
of 
a 
more 
open 
consultative 
process 
was 
the 
establishment 
of 
the 
Inter-Ministerial Working 
Group 
on 
Regulatory 
Reform 
in 
2001, 
which 
has 
been 
recently transformed 
into 
a 
Council on 
Regulatory 
Reform. 
The 
Council 
reviews 
draft 
laws 
and other 
major 
regulations 
for 
their 
impact 
on 
the 
private 
sector. The 
Council 
has 
invited 
the 
chair 
of 
the 
SME 
Advisory 
Board to 
sit 
as 
a 
permanent member 
to 
bring 
business 
interests 
into 
its 
deliberations. 
Supported 
by 
PFSAC 
11, 
the 
Council 
has 
initiated 
reform 
of 
the 
Rules 
of 
Operations 
of 
the 
Government 
in 
order 
to 
establish 
the 
public 
discussion 
of 
laws 
and 
decrees 
as 
a 
rule 
and 
not 
as 
an 
exception. 
This 
will 
significantly 
improve 
the 
transparency 
of 
policy 
making 
by 
bringing 
in 
a wider 
range 
of 
affected 
interests. 
The Government 
has 
already launched 
several 
successful 
public 
consultation 
processes, 
such 
as 
public-private 
sector 
dialogue 
on 
the 
draft 
Leasing 
Law, 
the 
Company Law, 
and, 
more 
recently, 
the 
Business 
Registration 
Law 
and the 
Bankruptcy 
Law. 
26. 
Business 
operations. 
As 
previously 
stated, 
one 
of 
the 
key 
areas 
of 
reform 
relates 
to 
facilitating 
the efficient 
operation 
of 
businesses. 
To 
this 
end, 
the 
Government 
program 
focuses 
adopting 
the 
new 
Enterprise 
Law, 
one 
of 
whose 
main 
objectives 
is 
modernizing 
corporate 
governance, 
adopting 
a 
Law 
011 
Concessions 
to 
facilitate 
public-private 
participation, 
building 
institutional 
capacity 
for 
regulatory 
reform, 
and 
improving 
enterprises’ 
access 
to 
finance 
27. 
Modernizing 
the 
Enterprise 
Law. 
The 
Government 
is 
committed 
to 
changing the Enterprise 
Law 
which 
occupies 
a 
central 
position 
in 
the 
system 
of 
commercial 
law. 
It 
interacts 
with 
the 
new 
laws 
on 
bankruptcy,  privatization, 
business 
registration, 
accounting, 
capital 
markets, 
investment 
funds 
and 
secured 
transactions 
that have either been 
passed 
recently 
or 
will 
be 
passed 
in 
the 
near 
future. 
The 
new 
law 
will 
be 
drafted 
so 
that 
it 
is 
consistent 
with 
EU 
practices. 
The rapid 
progress 
in 
privatization 
and 
new 
private 
business 
development 
is 
exposing  significant  legal 
weaknesses, 
particularly 
in 
the 
area 
of 
corporate 
governance, 
including 
the 
duties 
and responsibilities 
of 
directors 
and 
managers, 
guidelines 
for 
shareholders’ 
meetings 
and 
voting, 
etc. 
The 
experience 
of 
other 
transition 
countries shows that 
all 
of 
these 
issues 
can 
be 
exploited effectively 
by 
unscrupulous 
shareholders, 
directors 
and 
managers. 
With 
the 
10 
Page  16
privatization 
process 
rapidly 
accelerating  and 
foreign 
investment 
returning 
to 
Serbia, 
good corporate 
governance becomes 
absolutely 
essential 
for 
successful 
transition. 
28. 
The 
new 
Enterprise 
Law 
will 
also 
provide 
for 
more 
flexible 
and 
effective  legal forms 
for 
enterprises. 
At 
this 
time, 
most 
entrepreneurs 
choose 
not 
to 
incorporate, 
partly 
because 
of 
administrative 
barriers, 
and 
partly 
because 
the 
Enterprise 
Law 
does 
not 
encourage sole 
entrepreneurs 
and 
very small 
businesses 
to 
use 
the 
legal forms provided 
by 
this 
law. 
Entrepreneurs 
are 
governed 
by 
a 
separate 
law, 
which 
treats 
them 
differently 
in 
almost 
every 
regard. 
The 
revised 
law 
will 
make 
it 
easier 
for 
entrepreneurs 
to 
incorporate; 
it 
will 
also 
provide 
small 
corporations 
(the 
“Limited 
Liability 
Corporation” 
form) 
with 
more 
of 
the 
protections 
accorded 
to 
large 
firms. 
The 
objective 
will 
be 
to 
create 
a 
single 
law 
governing 
all 
enterprises 
using 
a 
corporate 
form. 
29. 
New 
Law 
on 
Concessions. 
The 
Foreign 
Investors 
Council 
of 
Belgrade 
has 
pointed out that 
the 
current 
concessions 
system 
suffers 
from 
legal 
inconsistencies 
between 
different 
levels 
of 
government. 
A 
new 
Law 
on 
Concessions 
has 
been 
drafted 
with 
the 
support 
of 
the 
donor community, 
with 
the 
German 
GTZ 
leading 
the 
process. 
The 
purpose 
of 
this 
law 
is 
to 
promote 
and  regulate 
investment 
in 
public 
infrastructure. 
The 
draft 
law 
replaces 
auctioning 
with 
a 
more 
transparent tendering, 
as 
the 
mechanism 
for 
awarding 
concessions. 
It 
will 
ensure 
equal 
and 
fair 
treatment 
of 
investors and 
competitive 
and transparent 
concession 
granting. 
The 
law 
is 
based 
on 
the 
idea of  a “framework” 
law 
consisting 
mostly 
of 
general 
principles, 
to 
be 
specified 
in 
a 
forthcoming 
subsidiary 
“tender 
and contracting 
regulation” 
and 
“uniform 
contract terms” 
which 
are 
broken 
down 
to 
a 
toolkit 
of 
a 
basic Concession Contract, 
a 
Catalogue 
of 
typical 
provisions 
and a summary 
of 
typical 
annexes. 
30. 
Building 
institutional 
capacity. 
In 
recent months, 
significant 
attention 
has 
been 
given 
to 
building 
the 
institutional 
capacity 
within 
the 
Government 
which would allow to 
manage 
reforms 
across 
various 
ministries. 
In 
200 
1 
the 
Government 
established  an 
Inter-Ministerial 
Working 
Group 
on 
Regulatory 
Reform 
(IMWG) 
to 
promote regulatory 
reform, 
ensure 
coordination 
across 
government 
agencies, 
and 
facilitate 
business-government dialogue. 
Although 
the 
IMWG 
began 
its 
activities 
at 
the 
end 
of 
200 
1, 
its 
progress 
has 
been 
limited. 
In 
September 
2002 
the 
Government 
took 
significant 
steps 
to 
revitalize 
the 
IMWG. 
3 
1. 
Specifically, 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Economy 
and 
Privatization (MOEP) 
proposed 
to 
the 
Government 
that 
the 
Group 
is 
transformed 
into 
a 
Council 
on 
Regulatory Reform, 
which would 
become 
a permanent 
advisory 
body 
to 
the Government 
on 
laws 
and 
policies affecting 
businesses 
by 
receiving 
the 
authority 
to 
review 
all 
draft 
laws 
and government 
decrees 
prior to 
adoption. 
This 
very 
important 
change 
aims 
to 
prevent 
the 
proliferation 
of 
laws 
and  regulations  that 
keep 
imposing 
barriers 
to 
business 
entry 
and 
operations. 
In 
order 
to 
strengthen 
capacity 
of 
the 
Council 
to 
review 
systemically 
and 
in 
a 
timely 
fashion 
PSD-related 
draft  laws 
and 
regulations, 
the 
Bank provided 
significant 
amount 
of 
technical 
assistance. 
This 
will 
allow 
the 
Council to 
develop  a 
concrete 
action 
program, 
establish 
procedures,  and 
begin 
systematically 
reviewing 
draft legislation 
that 
impact 
business 
activities. 
32. 
Improving 
access 
to 
finance. 
Limited 
access 
to 
finance 
continues 
to 
be 
one 
of 
the 
most 
severe 
constraints 
to 
private 
sector development. 
The 
financial 
difficulties 
and 
still 
low 
level 
of 
confidence 
in 
the 
state-owned banks and 
the 
relatively 
low 
capitalization 
of 
the 
existing 
private 
banks have 
precluded 
the 
financial 
sector 
to 
respond 
adequately 
to 
the 
growing 
demands 
of 
the 
private 
sector. 
In 
addition 
to 
reforming 
the 
financial 
sector, 
the 
legal 
and 
regulatory framework 
needs 
to 
provide 
the 
right 
incentives 
for 
banks 
and non-bank 
financial 
institutions 
to 
finance 
the 
private 
sector. 
The 
Government’s 
reform 
program 
centers 
on 
two 
areas 
to 
promote 
enterprise 
access 
to 
finance: 
(i) 
introduction 
of 
a 
system 
of 
secured 
financing; 
and 
(ii) 
support 
for 
the 
establishment 
of 
regulatory framework conducive 
for 
leasing 
operations. 
11

The 
objective 
of 
the 
securedfznancing 
system 
reform 
is 
to 
create 
a modern,  enabling, 
legal 
framework 
and 
appropriate 
implementing 
institutions 
that 
will 
support 
credit 
transactions 
which 
involve 
movable property 
as 
collateral. 
It 
will 
provide 
the 
legal 
structure 
within which 
modern 
secured 
financing 
of 
inventory, equipment, accounts and consumer goods can develop, 
and 
will 
improve 
the 
cost 
of 
credit 
and 
the 
efficiency 
of 
the 
market 
for 
secured transactions. 
The 
Government 
reform 
program 
includes: 
(i) 
adopting 
the 
Law 
on 
Secured 
Transactions, 
and 
the 
regulations 
of 
the 
Collateral 
Registry, 
and 
ensuring 
consistency 
with 
other relevant 
commercial 
laws  and 
regulations; 
(ii) 
establishing  centralized 
collateral 
registry 
operating 
as 
public 
information 
provider; 
and 
(iii) 
improving 
understanding 
of 
the 
new 
legal provisions 
and 
their 
practical 
use. 
The 
introduction 
of 
the 
secured 
financing 
system 
will 
be 
followed 
by 
broad 
dissemination 
activities 
aimed 
at: 
(i) 
training 
of 
judges,  bankers and 
entrepreneurs 
to 
improve 
understanding 
of 
the 
new  legal  provisions 
and 
their 
means 
of 
enforceinent; 
and 
(ii) 
dissemination 
of 
information 
on 
the 
new 
system 
of 
secured 
financing 
to 
potential credit 
users, 
lenders, lawyers, 
accountants, 
and others 
likely 
to 
use 
or 
benefit 
from 
the 
new 
system.

The 
lack 
of 
an appropriate 
legal framework 
limits 
leasing 
operations. 
A 
review 
of 
existing 
laws 
and regulations 
affecting 
the 
development 
of 
leasing 
operations 
has 
been 
carried 
out 
by 
a 
Working 
Group 
established 
by 
the 
Ministry 
of 
International Economic 
Relations 
(MIER) 
and 
supported 
by 
the 
Southeast 
Europe Enterprise Development 
(SEED). 
Based 
on 
the 
results 
of 
the 
review, 
a 
draft 
Leasing 
Law 
has 
been 
discussed 
with 
major 
stakeholders 
in 
the 
business 
community. 
In 
parallel, 
the 
work 
is 
underway 
to 
introduce 
required 
amendments 
to 
other 
relevant 
laws, 
in 
particular 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
taxation, 
accounting and 
customs. 
33. 
Business 
exit. 
A 
functioning 
bankruptcy 
law 
is 
required 
in 
Serbia 
to 
provide 
an 
efficient 
alternative 
to 
the 
methods 
of 
privatization 
of 
social 
and 
state 
capital 
set 
out 
in 
the 
Privatization 
Law. 
The 
MOEP 
has 
led 
the 
preparation 
of 
a 
draft 
new 
insolvency 
law, 
with 
the 
assistance 
of 
foreign 
and 
local 
experts 
with 
considerable 
input 
from 
the 
Bank. 
The 
provisions 
of 
the 
new 
law 
are 
consistent 
with 
EU 
practices 
and 
have 
been 
designed 
to 
minimize 
the 
impact 
of 
existing 
institutional 
deficiencies 
in 
the 
judiciary 
and 
the 
trustee 
community. 
First, 
a 
Supervisory 
Body 
will 
be 
established 
to 
license, 
supervise, 
and  regulate 
bankruptcy 
administrators 
(trustees). 
Second, 
in 
view 
of 
the 
experience 
of 
other 
post- 
socialist 
economies 
where 
bankruptcy 
cases 
were 
fraught 
with 
collusion 
among 
bankruptcy 
administrators, 
judges 
and 
creditors,  a 
creation 
of 
a specialized 
Bankruptcy 
Administration Agency 
has 
been envisaged. 
This 
Agency,  associated 
with 
the 
MOEP, 
would 
be 
the 
only  party 
which 
could 
be 
appointed 
as 
the 
trustee 
of 
a 
socially- 
or 
state-owned enterprise. 
The 
draft 
new 
law 
also contains a 
specific 
provision 
designed 
to 
expedite 
the 
opening 
of 
bankruptcy 
proceedings, 
as 
well 
as 
a 
comprehensive 
section 
on 
reorganization 
of 
viable 
debtors. 
The  bankruptcy 
process 
for 
socially- 
and 
state- 
owned 
enterprises 
will 
continue 
to 
be 
carried out 
under 
the 
authority 
and supervision 
of 
the 
courts, 
as 
will 
all 
other 
bankruptcy 
proceedings. 
The 
MOEP, 
with 
United 
States 
Agency 
for 
International Development 
(USAID) 
and 
Bank 
support, 
has 
begun 
to 
develop 
a general trustee 
training 
course 
and 
a 
program 
to 
educate 
the 
judges 
on 
the 
concepts 
contained 
in 
the 
new

Medium-term reform 
objectives. 
As 
noted 
above, 
Serbia 
needs 
a 
more 
efficient 
and 
market- 
friendly 
business 
environment 
if 
privatization, market 
reforms, and trade and 
investment 
liberalization 
are 
to 
support 
sustainable 
growth 
of 
a 
competitive 
market 
economy. 
Therefore, 
sustainability 
and 
continuation 
of 
the 
current 
reform 
program 
must 
be 
ensured. 
The 
four 
key 
objectives 
of 
the 
program 
include: 
i. 
ensuring proper 
implementation 
and operation 
of 
the 
modern bankruptcy 
regime, 
which 
is 
needed 
not 
only 
to 
create 
financial  discipline 
and 
allow 
exit 
of 
unviable 
enterprises 
but 
to 
allow 
the 
privatization 
and 
restructuring 
of 
the 
potentially 
viable 
ones;

11. 
developing proper 
corporate governance 
institutions that 
would 
support 
the 
future 
development 
and better 
management 
of 
capital 
markets; 
111. 
developing anti-monopoly legislation 
and 
institutional 
capacity 
for 
enforcing 
it, 
which 
is 
crucial 
if 
Serbia 
is 
to 
build 
the 
foundations 
for 
its 
plans 
to 
join 
the 
EU; 
and, 
iv. 
laying 
the 
foundations 
for 
the 
development 
of 
a 
knowledge-based economy, 
to 
ensure 
that 
Serbia 
can 
be  competitive 
in 
the  global 
economy, 
by 
strengthening 
the 
intellectual property 
rights, 
increasing 
competition 
in 
the 
telecommunication 
sector, 
and  improvements 
in 
the 
R&D 
infrastructure. 
... 
These 
four 
pillars 
will 
be 
pursued 
in 
conjunction 
with 
a 
serious 
commitment 
to 
scale 
up 
the 
ongoing program 
of 
restructuring 
of 
state- 
and 
socially-owned 
enterprises 
(see 
section 
1V.B 
below). 
B. 
Financial 
Sector 
Regulatory and 
Supervisory 
Framework 
Current 
Status 
35. 
Banking 
supervision. 
The 
onset 
of 
the 
reform 
period 
in 
early 
2001 
required 
the 
National 
Bank 
of 
Yugoslavia 
(NBY) 
--today  the 
National Bank 
of 
Serbia 
-- 
bank 
supervision 
department 
to 
devote 
its 
energies 
to 
bank 
diagnostic 
reviews 
and 
subsequent 
corrective 
action 
or 
resolution. 
These 
activities called 
for 
selected  changes 
to 
banking 
legislation 
and 
placed 
escalated demands 
on 
supervisory 
staff. 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
supervisory 
management 
initiated 
a 
strengthening 
program  aimed 
at 
rebuilding 
the 
department’s 
oversight  capacity  and  procedural  methodology. 
The 
Bank’s 
support 
provided 
under 
PFSAC 
I 
helped 
to 
guide the 
necessary, 
initial 
legislative 
changes 
and 
the 
first 
steps 
in 
the 
strengthening 
process. 
Since 
then,  a 
Supervisory 
Development 
Plan 
(SDP)  has 
been designed 
by 
management 
(with 
assistance 
from 
USAID) 
and 
was 
adopted 
as 
an 
official 
statement 
for 
the future 
direction 
of 
supervision. 
This 
document maps 
out 
the 
building 
process, 
particularly 
the organizational 
and 
process 
changes 
needed 
to 
establish 
and implement 
a 
new 
supervisory 
approach 
based 
both 
on 
risk 
analysis 
and 
compliance 
verification. 
36. 
While 
the SDP 
was 
formally 
adopted 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
year, 
work 
to 
meet the development 
steps 
began 
in 
earnest 
during 
the 
fourth 
quarter 
of 
2002. 
Several 
key 
benchmarks have already 
been 
achieved. 
A 
Supervisory 
Review 
Committee 
(SRC)  was 
established, 
composed 
of 
the 
senior managers 
of 
the 
department 
and 
the 
NBS 
Vice-Governor, 
to 
oversee 
and 
monitor 
both 
supervisory 
activities and 
progress against 
the plan. 
A 
mission 
statement 
which 
formally 
presents 
the 
NBS’s 
supervisory objectives 
and 
direction 
was 
approved 
by 
the Committee 
and the 
NBS 
Governor and 
presented 
to 
the 
public. 
While 
further 
steps 
and 
progress 
have been 
made, 
key 
to 
the 
future 
of 
the program 
have 
been 
the 
department’s 
initial 
steps 
to 
prepare 
supervisory 
strategies 
for 
individual 
banks 
and 
its 
improved dialog 
with 
the 
banking 
community. 
The 
banks’ 
supervisory 
strategies 
(and 
execution 
thereof) 
will 
ultimately 
represent, 
in 
large 
part, 
the 
culmination 
of 
the 
new 
risk 
based 
supervisory approach 
and the redirected supervisory 
methodology. 
In 
concert 
with 
the 
steps 
taken 
in 
the 
supervisory process 
arena, 
a 
number 
of 
enhanced 
and 
new 
prudential 
 regulation^'^ 
have 
been prepared 
and 
formally 
approved 
by 
the 
NBS. 
Banks 
are also 
now 
required 
to 
adhere 
to 
and 
report according 
to 
International 
Accounting 
Standards (IAS), 
consistent 
with 
the 
recently 
passed 
new 
Accounting 
Law. 
Annual 
reports 
for 
the 
financial 
year 
2003 
will 
be 
prepared and 
reported 
using 
IAS. 
37. 
While 
many 
important 
steps 
have been 
made, 
much 
remains 
to 
be 
accomplished. 
The 
SDP 
outlines 
further 
development 
steps; 
however, 
the 
key 
to 
real 
change 
and 
more 
effective oversight 
of 
the 
l4 
The 
now formally 
approved 
prudential 
regulations 
include 
areas 
of 
capital 
adequacy, 
investment 
limitations, 
liquidity, 
internal 
controls, 
internal 
audit functions, 
credit 
classification, 
and 
credit 
policy.

banking 
industry 
will 
be 
the 
rigorous 
implementation 
of 
the 
new 
supervisory 
approach. 
This 
will 
require 
the 
increased 
involvement 
of 
senior and executive management 
and 
the 
active 
participation 
and 
support 
of 
all 
levels 
of 
supervisory staff. Also, 
governance 
of 
the 
NBS 
remains a 
concern 
as 
it 
has 
been 
operating 
without 
a 
formal 
supervisory 
board. 
While 
this 
may 
have 
provided 
the 
ability to 
act 
swiftly 
and 
decisively 
in 
the 
past, 
in 
going forward 
the 
NBS 
should 
adhere 
to 
proper 
internal 
governance 
principles. 
3 
8. 
Deposit insurance. 
More 
than a 
decade 
ago 
SAM 
established the 
Bank 
Rehabilitation 
Agency 
(BRA) 
to 
carry 
out 
its 
mandate 
of 
deposit 
insurer. 
In 
September 
2001, 
in 
order 
to quickly 
implement 
a 
significant bank resolution 
program, 
the 
mandate and 
powers 
of 
the 
BRA 
were 
expanded 
to 
include 
bank 
liquidation 
functions. 
However, 
the 
BRA 
Law, 
as 
well 
as 
its 
statute, 
do 
not 
provide 
the 
interim 
corporate 
governance 
and 
financial 
management 
arrangements 
that 
are 
required 
to 
ensure 
the 
separation 
of 
responsibilities,  accountability, 
and 
resources 
for 
it 
to 
carry 
out effectively 
its 
current dual 
mandate. 
In 
addition, 
the 
levels 
of 
premiums 
and 
coverage 
of 
deposit insurance have 
not 
been adjusted 
over 
time 
to 
reflect 
the 
changing 
state 
and 
structure 
of 
the 
banking 
system 
and macroeconomic conditions. Thus 
the 
funds 
available 
are 
not 
sufficient 
to 
provide 
the 
agency 
with 
the 
financial 
resources 
to 
reimburse 
insured 
depositors 
in 
case 
of 
a 
significant 
bank failure, 
and 
insured 
depositors have been 
de 
facto 
benefiting 
from 
a 
blanket 
government 
guarantee 
with 
its 
moral 
hazard 
implications. 
39. 
Money laundering. 
Although 
it 
is 
difficult to 
estimate 
the 
level 
of 
money 
laundering 
(funds 
from 
illegal 
activities 
flowing 
through 
the 
legitimate 
financial 
system), 
many 
observers consider Serbia 
to 
be 
a 
transit 
country 
for 
smuggling 
between 
Asia 
and the 
Balkans. 
A 
lack 
of 
funds  and modern equipment 
hinders 
monitoring 
of 
goods 
transiting 
the 
country. 
These 
factors  together 
with 
the 
still-developing 
supervisory capacity 
in 
the 
banking 
system 
make 
SAM 
a 
prime 
target 
for 
money 
laundering. 
Decisive 
efforts 
from 
the 
SAM 
and Serbian Governments have 
brought 
a 
new 
anti-money 
laundering 
law 
(AML) 
which took 
effect 
on 
July 
1, 
2002. 
The 
new 
AML 
law 
authorized 
the 
creation 
of 
a 
Serbian 
financial 
intelligence 
unit 
(FIU) 
with 
the 
following 
functions: 
(i) 
receive reports 
of 
suspicious transactions 
froin 
financial institutions 
and develop a 
database; 
(ii) 
analyze 
the 
reports 
to 
identify 
possible 
criminal 
activity; 
(iii) 
forward 
reports 
of 
suspect 
transactions 
to 
appropriate 
law 
enforcement 
officials for 
investigation 
and 
possible  prosecution; 
and, 
(iv) 
establish 
effective  cooperation 
with 
foreign 
counterpart 
FIUs 
to 
share 
information, 
when 
appropriate, 
to 
support  the  cross-border 
investigation 
and  prosecution 
of 
money 
laundering 
cases. 
40. 
Insurance 
sector 
reform. 
Insurance 
regulation 
and 
supervision 
in 
SAM 
was 
traditionally 
carried 
out 
by 
the 
Insurance  Supervisory 
Authority 
(HA) 
department 
within 
the 
SAM 
Ministry 
of 
Finance. 
Activities 
of 
insurance  companies 
and 
their 
supervision 
are 
regulated 
by 
the 
Law 
on 
Property 
and 
Personal Insurance, 
as 
well 
as 
six 
additional 
regulations that 
have been enacted 
by 
the 
ISA. 
However, 
the 
current 
insurance 
legislative 
and 
regulatory framework 
does 
not 
comply 
with 
internationally 
accepted 
insurance 
regulatory 
and 
supervisory 
principles 
and 
needs 
modernizing. 
No 
effective 
supervision 
takes 
place 
because 
the 
ISA 
is 
understaffed 
and 
does 
not 
have 
sufficient 
resources 
to 
retain qualified 
staff. 
In 
addition 
to 
these 
shortcomings, 
the 
functions 
of 
the 
ISA 
are 
currently 
being 
transferred 
to 
the 
Serbian 
Ministry 
of 
Finance and 
Economy (MOFE) 
thus 
further 
straining 
its 
already 
limited 
capacity. 
Government’s 
Reform Program 
4 
1. 
Banking 
supervision. 
The 
NBS 
is 
committed 
to 
continuing 
to 
implement 
the 
roadmap 
provided 
by 
the 
SDP 
and 
all 
its 
attendant requirements. 
Good 
initial 
progress 
has 
been 
made 
in 
establishing a 
new 
framework 
for 
supervision. However, the 
challenge 
now 
facing 
supervisory 
management (and 
which 
will 
continue 
into 
the 
future) 
is 
the 
need 
to 
implement 
the 
developing framework 
at 
all 
levels 
of 
supervisory 
staff, 
management,  and  the 
banking 
industry. 
This 
will 
require 
increased 
executive 
and 
senior 
management 
involvement 
and 
interaction 
with 
staff 
and 
the 
banking 
industry. 
Furthermore,  the 
new 
14 
Page  20
methodology, 
by 
definition,  calls for  a 
more 
anticipatory 
approach 
to  supervision 
through 
which 
risk 
trends 
are 
detected, 
monitored 
and 
addressed 
within 
individual 
banks 
and 
the 
system 
as 
a whole. 
42. 
The next 
steps 
to 
which 
the 
authorities 
are 
committed 
and 
which 
will 
assist 
in 
the 
implementation 
phase 
of 
the 
SDP, 
include 
the 
development 
of 
a 
supervisory operating 
procedure 
which 
details, 
internal 
to 
the 
NBS, 
the 
specific 
methodology 
for 
implementation 
of 
the 
new supervisory 
approach. 
This 
is, 
in 
part, 
addressed 
through 
the 
overall 
supervisory 
strategy 
that 
has 
been 
prepared 
in 
conjunction 
with 
the 
mission 
statement. 
Implementation 
of 
the 
new 
methodology 
also 
will 
be 
promoted 
through 
the 
further preparation 
and 
refinement 
of 
supervisory 
strategies 
for 
each 
bank 
in 
the 
system. 
Other 
steps 
that 
are 
planned 
and 
that 
will 
support 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
methodology 
include: 
(i) 
establishing 
lines 
of 
delegated 
decision 
making 
within 
the 
supervisory 
department; 
(ii) 
establishing 
a 
system 
of 
internal 
MIS 
for 
senior 
and 
executive 
management 
and 
SRC 
reporting; 
(iii) 
elevation 
of 
the 
role 
and 
responsibility 
of 
bank 
boards 
and 
management 
through 
increased 
supervisory interaction; 
and 
(iv) 
enhancing 
the 
schedule 
of 
risk 
stratified 
bank examinations 
to 
be 
completed 
during 
the 
upcoming 
year. 
The examination 
procedure 
manual 
and 
the 
bank 
risk 
rating 
system 
will 
also 
continue 
to 
be 
refined during 
the 
upcoming period. 
43. 
Several 
legislative 
changes 
need 
to 
occur 
in 
the 
near 
future. 
With 
the 
advent 
of 
the 
new 
constitutional 
arrangement between Serbia 
and 
Montenegro, 
the 
legal 
basis 
for 
the 
former 
NBY 
has 
been 
adjusted 
to 
establish 
the 
new 
NBS. 
The 
former 
“Law 
on 
the 
National 
Bank 
of 
Yugoslavia” 
will 
be 
revised 
to 
reflect 
the 
new framework. 
The new 
law 
will 
ensure 
the 
continued 
independence 
of 
the 
NBS 
and, 
thus, 
the 
ability 
of 
the 
supervisory 
function 
to 
make and 
administer 
decisions 
free 
from political 
and other 
outside interference. 
Likewise, 
the 
governance 
of 
the 
NBS 
will 
be 
further 
strengthened 
with 
the 
new 
law, 
by 
requiring 
the 
appointment 
of 
a 
supervisory board 
that 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
the 
oversight 
of 
the 
NBS 
and 
its 
key 
functions. 
Changes 
to 
prudential banking regulation 
are 
expected 
to 
support 
the 
evolving 
supervisory 
process. 
Particularly, new supporting regulation 
for 
the 
licensing 
process 
is 
planned. 
This 
will 
be 
particularly 
important 
in 
light 
of 
the 
ownership 
and 
structural 
changes 
the 
banking industry 
is 
currently 
undergoing. 
44. 
Deposit  insurance 
reform 
With 
donor 
support 
(UK 
DFID), 
the 
BRA’S 
deposit 
insurance 
division 
has 
made 
progress 
in 
setting 
up 
basic procedures 
to 
ensure 
accurate 
and 
prompt 
payment 
of 
premiums, reimbursement 
of 
depositors’ claims, 
and 
collection 
of 
premiums 
from 
the 
insured 
institutions. 
It 
is 
envisioned 
that 
once 
the 
bank 
resolution program 
is 
completed, 
the 
BRA 
would 
function 
only 
as 
the 
deposit 
insurer. 
The authorities 
have 
decided 
to 
migrate 
towards 
a 
new 
deposit insurance 
scheme 
that 
will 
be 
consistent 
with 
EU 
directives, 
internationally 
recognized 
best 
practices, and 
in 
line 
with 
the 
expected 
structure 
and 
risk 
profile 
of 
the 
banking 
system 
and  macroeconomic 
conditions. 
To 
that 
end, 
the 
Government’s 
program 
includes 
the 
following 
actions: 
(i) 
amendment 
of 
the 
law 
and 
statute 
of 
the 
BRA 
to introduce 
institutional 
and 
corporate 
governance arrangements 
enabling 
an 
effective cohabitation 
of 
the 
deposit 
insurer 
and bank 
liquidator 
for 
the 
time 
necessary 
to 
complete 
the 
bank 
resolution 
program; 
and, 
(ii) 
an 
increase 
- 
in 
the 
medium 
term 
-- 
in 
the 
premiums 
collected 
from 
insured 
banks 
up to levels 
closer 
to 
that 
foreseen 
or 
foreseeable 
under 
the 
new deposit 
insurance 
law; 
(iii) 
preparation 
of 
a 
new 
deposit 
insurance 
law. 
The 
authorities 
have made 
it 
clear 
that 
the 
envisioned 
revamping 
of 
the 
existing 
deposit 
insurance 
system 
will 
not 
be 
launched 
until 
2004, 
when pending 
resolution action 
in 
the 
banking 
system 
are 
expected 
to 
be 
substantially completed. 
45. 
Anti-money laundering. 
Government’s 
efforts to 
foster 
AML 
reform 
aim 
at 
developing 
the 
FIU 
that 
was 
created 
under 
the 
AML 
law. 
The 
newly 
established 
FIU 
has 
been 
staffed 
and 
is 
working 
toward 
becoming 
fully 
operational to 
standards 
set 
forth 
by 
the 
Egmont Group 
of 
FIUs, 
which 
may 
soon 
accept 
the 
Serbian 
FIU 
as 
a 
new 
member. 
The 
FIU 
has 
hired 
five 
commissioners, 
established 
a 
website, 
and 
is 
now performing 
basic 
operational 
tasks, 
including 
receiving 
reports 
of 
suspicious 
transactions 
from 
banks 
-- 
some 
of 
which 
have been 
forwarded to 
law 
enforcement authorities 
for 
investigation. The 
FIU 
is 
currently 
in 
the 
process 
of 
establishing 
an 
electronic 
database 
to  maintain 
reports 
of 
suspicious 
15 
Page  21
transactions, 
and 
formalizing 
procedures 
for 
cooperating 
with 
foreign 
FIUs 
and 
relevant 
domestic 
agencies. 
The 
FIU 
has 
thus 
laid 
the 
foundation 
to 
become 
an 
effective intelligence 
unit 
and 
can 
become 
fully 
effective 
in 
2003 
provided 
that: 
(i) 
adequate 
budget 
allocation 
is 
made 
for 
its 
operations 
in 
2003; 
(ii) 
technical 
assistance 
from 
donors  and  counterpart 
FIUs 
continues; 
(iii) 
the 
FIU 
meets

Insurance 
sector. 
The 
Government’s 
reform 
program 
focuses 
on 
the 
following 
measures 
aimed 
to 
modernize the 
regulatory 
and supervisory 
framework 
for 
the 
insurance sector: 
(i) 
development 
and 
implementation 
of 
a 
new 
insurance 
law 
compliant 
with 
IAIS 
core supervisory 
principles 
in 
areas 
such 
as 
licensing, 
changes 
in 
control, 
investment 
regulation, and 
internal audit 
function; 
(ii) 
the establishment 
of 
a 
new 
insurance 
supervisory 
unit 
within 
MOFE; 
and, 
(iii) 
the 
development and 
implementation 
of 
an action 
plan to 
strengthen 
insurance 
supervision. Technical 
assistance 
in 
these 
areas 
is 
being 
provided 
by 
the 
Bank 
and 
other 
donors. 
47. 
Medium-term reform 
objectives. 
Reform 
objectives 
for 
banking 
supervision 
in 
the 
medium 
term 
will 
play directly 
off 
NBS’s 
mission 
statement 
and 
the 
SDP 
and 
reflect 
the changing 
banking 
and 
enterprise 
environment. 
The 
thrust 
of 
the 
strengthening 
program 
is 
to 
introduce 
a 
proactive, 
risk 
based 
method 
of 
oversight 
which 
will 
be 
critical 
during 
the 
current 
period 
of 
structural 
change and 
privatizatioii 
of 
banks 
and 
enterprises. Furthermore, 
the 
independent 
oversight 
role 
of 
the 
supervisor 
must 
be clearly 
exercised 
with 
banks  made  aware  that  the 
NBS 
will 
continue 
to 
require 
strict, 
safe 
and 
sound 
underwriting 
standards. 
Growth 
trends, 
new 
products, and 
new 
and changing 
risk 
profiles 
in 
banks and 
in 
the 
system 
as 
a 
whole 
must 
be 
detected and 
monitored 
in 
a 
timely 
manner. Therefore, 
the 
supervisory 
function 
must 
continue 
to 
focus 
on 
more effective communication 
within 
the 
department 
itself, 
within 
the 
NBS 
as 
a 
whole 
and 
within 
the 
banking 
industry, 
boards and management. 
In 
this 
regard: 
i. 
offsite 
monitoring 
processes 
and 
early 
warning 
systems 
must 
be 
further 
developed and become 
firmly 
entrenched 
in 
the 
supervisory 
process; 
ii. 
the 
examination 
process 
must 
be 
risk 
focused and 
must 
not 
falter 
as 
this 
is 
one 
of 
the 
more 
important tools 
for 
detecting and 
monitoring 
trends 
in 
the 
system; 
iii. 
the 
examination 
schedule 
will 
continue 
to 
be 
carefully 
prepared 
and 
monitored 
by 
the 
SRC and 
executive 
management 
on 
an 
ongoing 
basis; 
and, 
iv. 
the 
processes 
and 
mechanisms 
within 
the 
NBS, 
such 
as 
the 
SRC, 
early 
warning 
systems, 
and 
overall 
supervisory 
procedures 
will 
continue 
to 
be 
established 
and 
refined 
in 
order 
to 
more 
effectively 
anticipate 
the 
future 
systemic 
risks. 
48. 
Beyond 
the  development 
of 
banking 
supervision,  and 
as 
the 
overall  financial 
sector 
further 
expands 
its 
activities, 
the 
supervisory and 
regulatory 
process 
must 
keep 
pace. 
The 
insurance 
and 
capital 
markets 
sectors 
are 
expected 
to 
expand at an 
increasing 
pace and 
assume 
growing 
significaiice 
in 
the 
country’s 
financial 
system. 
As 
a result, the 
authorities 
need 
to 
also focus 
on 
building 
supervision 
in 
these 
additional 
two 
areas. 
Thus 
they 
will 
have 
to 
begin 
formulating 
their 
medium- and 
long-term 
view 
on 
how 
the 
structure 
of 
financial 
sector 
supervision 
should 
evolve. 
While 
no 
decisions have 
been 
made, 
further 
research 
and evaluation 
of 
the 
current 
and 
alternative 
structures 
will 
continue.

insurance sector. 
IV. 
Privatization 
and Restructuring 
of 
Banks 
and 
Enterprises 
Banking 
Sector 
Reform 
Current 
Status. 
Supported 
by 
PFSAC 
I 
and 
related 
technical 
assistance 
provided 
by 
the 
Bank 
and 
other 
donors, 
the 
authorities 
made 
significant 
progress 
in 
the 
restructuring 
of 
the 
banking 
sector 
during 
2001, 
culminating 
in 
the closure 
of 
the 
four 
largest banks 
in 
January 2002. 
During 
this 
period, 
under 
remarkable 
leadership 
of 
the 
NBS, 
23 
insolvent 
banks 
representing 
nearly 
two 
thirds 
of 
the 
assets 
of 
the 
system 
were 
either 
liquidated 
or 
put 
under 
bankr~ptcy'~. 
To 
support 
these 
efforts, 
and 
following 
key 
legislative 
amendments 
passed 
in 
mid-200 
1, 
the 
BRA 
became 
the 
designated 
administrator 
for 
banks 
in 
bankruptcy. 
With 
substantial 
Bank 
and 
donor 
support, 
the 
BRA 
has 
successfully 
executed 
its 
expanded 
duties, 
including 
the 
closure and commencement 
of 
bankruptcy 
proceedings 
for 
the 
four 
largest banks. 
The 
implementation 
of 
remedial 
plans 
for 
the 
five 
banks 
that were 
in 
rehabilitation 
at 
the 
end 
of 
2001 
continued 
during 
2002 
and, 
as 
a 
result, 
four 
of 
these 
banks 
were 
merged 
to 
form 
a 
viable 
larger bank 
- 
Niska 
Banka 
- 
in 
late 
2002, 
which 
was 
recapitalized 
by 
the 
BRA 
and 
now 
meets 
prudential 
requirements. 
The 
BRA 
has 
successfully 
turned 
around 
Niska 
Banka, 
which 
now 
has 
positive 
income 
and 
operating 
cash 
flows, 
and 
is 
expected 
to 
be 
a 
candidate 
for 
early 
privatization 
in 
2003. 
The 
remaining 
bank 
in 
rehabilitation 
is 
considered 
to 
be 
non-viable 
by 
the 
BRA 
and 
is 
pending 
a 
NBS 
and 
Government 
decision 
that 
is 
likely 
to 
call for 
its 
liquidation 
or 
gradual 
closing. 
5 
1. 
As 
a 
result 
of 
the 
restructuring 
process 
and 
the 
entry 
six 
new 
foreign 
banks, 
confidence 
has 
begun 
to 
return 
to 
the  Serbian 
banking 
system. 
This 
is 
evidenced 
by 
the 
rapid 
growth 
of 
foreign 
exchange 
deposits, 
which 
rose 
from 
Euro 
538 
million 
at 
end-June 
2001 
to 
over 
Euro 
1 
billion 
at end-2002. Progress 
has 
also been made 
during 
2002 
in 
reducing 
the 
state 
majority 
stake 
in 
the 
recently 
created 
National 
Savings 
Bank 
(NSB) 
and 
in 
separating 
its 
governance 
from 
the 
NBS. 
During 
2002 
while 
the 
authorities 
worked 
on 
developing 
a 
viable 
strategy 
for 
resolution 
of 
the 
still 
large 
number 
of 
banks 
with 
asset 
quality 
problems 
(largely 
but not 
exclusively derived 
from 
credits financed 
using 
Paris 
and 
London Club 
(PLC) 
liabilities 
prior 
to 
1990). 
One 
response 
to 
this 
challenge 
was 
the 
Serbian 
Government 
decision 
to 
pass 
the 
PLC 
Law 
in 
July 
2002, 
which 
provided 
for 
the 
mandatory  debt-to-equity 
conversion 
of 
banks' 
PLC 
liabilities  into 
equity 
to 
be 
owned 
by 
Serbia. 
The 
consequence 
of 
this 
law 
has 
been 
a 
de 
facto 
nationalizatioii 
of 
a  large 
proportion 
of 
the 
banking 
system 
(15 
banksI6), 
including 
a 
majority 
state 
position 
in 
two 
of 
the 
three largest banks 
in 
the 
system, 
and 
a 
significant 
stake 
in 
the 
largest 
private 
bank 
in 
the 
country. 
The 
PLC 
Law 
also 
stipulated 
the 
state's 
obligation 
to 
initiate 
the 
privatization 
process 
of 
the 
nationalized 
banks 
within 
six 
months 
of 
the 
actual 
execution 
of 
the 
debt-to-equity conversion. 
l5 
This 
included 
the 
four 
largest Serbian 
banks, 
representing 
61 
percent 
of 
the 
assets 
of 
the 
banking 
system. 
l6 
A 
total 
of 
17 
banks 
were 
affected 
by 
the 
Serbian 
Government decision 
to 
pass 
the 
PLC 
Law. 
Of 
these 
banks, 
five 
were 
already 
in 
rehabilitation 
and 
under 
fill 
state 
control 
at 
the 
time 
of 
passage 
of 
the 
law, 
three 
of 
which 
were 
subsequently 
merged. 
As 
of 
December 
2002 
there were 
thus: 
12 
PLC 
Law-affected 
banks 
not 
in 
rehabilitation 
and 
three 
in 
rehabilitation. 
These 
15 
banks account 
for 
more than 
half 
of 
the 
banking 
system 
of 
Serbia. 
With 
one 
significant 
exception, 
all 
of 
the 
15 
banks 
were 
either under 
state 
control 
or 
under 
ownership 
of 
socially-owned 
enterprises 
prior 
to 
the 
debt-to-equity 
conversion 
mandated 
by 
the 
PLC 
law. 
17 
Page  23
52. 
The 
central 
issue 
facing 
the 
authorities 
in 
the 
next 
two 
years 
is 
thus 
the 
resolution 
of 
the 
PLC 
Law-affected 
banks: 
whether 
by 
privatization or 
by 
closure and 
liquidation. 
The 
latter outcome 
is 
likely 
in 
a 
number 
of 
cases 
where 
the 
debt-to-equity conversion 
may 
be 
insufficient 
to 
restore 
solvency. 
In 
early 
2003, 
the 
authorities 
began 
to 
address 
this 
issue 
by: 
(i) 
approving 
a 
banking resolution 
strategy 
for 
implementing 
the 
resolution 
process 
which 
centers 
on 
attempts 
to 
privatize 
the 
PLC 
Law-affected 
banks 
without 
the 
use 
of 
fiscal 
resources; 
(ii) 
implementing 
enhanced 
controls 
and governance 
over 
the 
affected 
banks 
to 
preserve 
their 
value; 
and, 
(iii) 
launching diagnostic 
audits 
of 
state 
majority 
ownership 
banks 
(and 
one 
additional private 
bank 
with 
a 
significant 
state 
participation) 
to 
ascertain 
their 
true 
condition 
after 
application 
of 
the 
provisions 
of 
the 
PLC 
Law. 
Simultaneously, 
tenders 
for 
a 
strategic 
adviser 
to 
the 
Government 
for 
the 
privatization 
process 
and 
for 
privatization 
advisers 
for 
three  banks 
have 
been 
launched. 
This 
is 
expected 
to 
result 
in 
the 
launch 
of 
privatization 
tenders 
for 
the 
first 
three 
PLC 
Law- 
affected 
banks 
in 
the 
second 
half 
of 
2003. 
53. 
Linkages 
with 
Enterprise Restructuring and 
Privatization. 
The 
approach 
to 
resolution 
of 
the 
banking 
system’s 
claims 
on 
the 
enterprise 
sector has 
a 
major 
impact 
on 
the 
ability 
of 
the authorities 
to 
restructure and 
privatize 
the 
enterprise sector 
itself. 
This 
point 
first 
became 
an 
important 
issue 
when 
the 
authorities 
sought 
to 
address 
the 
conflict 
between 
the 
BRA’S 
responsibilities 
as 
the 
liquidator 
of 
banks 
(i.e. 
as 
the 
enforcer 
of 
the 
banks’ 
claims 
on 
enterprise borrowers)  and 
the 
objective 
of 
the 
Privatization 
Agency  (PA) 
of 
moving 
forward 
as 
rapidly 
as 
possible 
with 
the 
enterprise 
restructuring 
and 
the 
privatization 
program. 
Subsequently, 
the issue 
has 
become 
more complex 
as 
the 
implications 
of 
the 
PLC 
Law 
have 
become apparent. 
Additional 
background 
on 
the 
linkages 
between 
the 
banking 
and 
enterprise 
sector 
restructuring 
and 
the 
Government’s 
program 
to 
facilitate workouts 
are 
described 
in 
the section 
on 
enterprise sector 
reform 
(paragraphs 
60-6 
1). 
54. 
Government’s 
Reform 
Program. 
The 
Government’s 
program 
for 
reform 
of 
the 
banking 
system 
builds 
on 
the 
progress made 
under 
PFSAC 
I, 
and 
targets 
resolving 
the 
interconnected 
problems 
of 
the 
PLC 
debts 
of 
banks and enterprises. 
The 
first 
phase 
of 
the 
bank 
restructuring 
program 
(launched under 
PFSAC 
I) 
will 
move toward 
issuing 
a 
tender 
for 
privatization 
of 
Niska 
Baiika 
in 
late 
2003 
and, 
during 
the 
course 
of 
2003, 
the 
resolution 
of 
a 
bank 
remaining 
under 
BRA 
control 
for which 
recapitalization 
and 
privatization 
is 
not 
considered 
a 
viable 
option. 
Further 
progress 
will 
be 
made 
in 
the 
liquidation 
of 
the 
non- 
financial 
assets 
of 
bankrupt 
banks 
being liquidated 
by 
the 
BRA, 
with 
the 
target 
of 
completing 
the 
sale 
or 
leasing 
out 
40 
percent 
of 
these 
assets 
by 
end-2003. 
55. 
The 
second 
phase 
of 
bank restructuring 
- 
triggered 
by 
the 
enactment 
of 
the 
PLC 
law 
- 
will 
accelerate 
as 
a 
result 
of 
the 
Government’s 
adoption 
of 
a 
comprehensive strategy 
to 
privatize 
or 
liquidate 
all 
banks 
that 
have been 
affected 
by 
the 
PLC 
law. 
The 
strategy 
includes 
the 
following 
main 
features: 
(i) 
emphasizes 
the 
importance 
of 
attracting 
strategic  investors 
to 
take 
over 
the 
banks; 
(ii) 
calls 
for 
implementation 
of 
controls 
over 
the 
operations 
of 
the 
banks 
during 
the 
pre-privatization period; 
(iii) 
requires 
diagnostic audits 
and 
the 
application 
of 
reinforced 
supervisory 
measures 
(including 
closure) 
for 
banks 
found 
to 
be 
insolvent; 
(iv) 
excludes 
the 
possibility 
of 
utilizing 
fiscal 
resources 
to 
recapitalize 
banks; 
and, 
(v) 
provides workable institutional 
arrangements 
to 
manage and execute 
the 
implementation 
process. 
Additional 
work 
is 
now 
underway 
to 
develop a 
parallel 
strategy 
for 
integrating 
the 
resolution 
of 
PLC 
assets 
now 
held 
by 
the 
banks 
with 
the 
privatization 
and 
restructuring program 
for 
state 
and 
socially 
owned 
enterprises, 
The 
Bank 
and 
donors 
are 
providing 
substantial 
technical 
assistance 
support 
for 
implementation 
of 
the 
PLC 
bank resolution 
and 
privatization 
strategy. 
Finally, 
the 
Government 
will 
signal 
its 
intention 
to 
withdraw 
from 
an 
ownership 
role 
in 
the 
banking 
sector 
by 
reducing 
the 
state-owned 
or 
controlled 
stake 
of 
the 
NSB 
to 
less 
than 
25 
percent 
by 
end-2003. 
56. 
Medium-term reform 
objectives. 
The 
authorities  recognize 
that 
completing 
the 
restructuring 
and 
privatization 
of 
the 
banking 
sector 
is 
a pre-requisite 
for 
the 
full 
development 
of 
the 
financial 
sector’s 
ability 
to 
support economic 
growth. Accordingly, the 
authorities 
have adopted 
an 
ambitious 
medium 
term 
18 
Page  24
agenda 
to 
be 
completed 
by 
end-2004 
which 
includes: 
(i) 
completion 
of 
the 
resolution 
of 
all 
remaining 
state 
stakes 
in 
banks 
(including 
all 
of 
the 
PLC 
Law-affected 
banks); 
(ii) 
closure 
of 
all 
remaining 
insolvent 
banks; 
(iii) 
the 
aggressive 
disposition 
of 
the 
non-financial 
assets 
of 
bank receiverships; 
(iv) 
completion 
of 
the 
liquidation or 
leasing out 
of 
the 
assets 
of 
banks closed 
in 
2001-2002; 
and, 
(v) 
rapid 
progress 
in 
the 
resolution 
of 
non-performing bankrupt 
and 
PLC 
law-affected 
banks’ 
claims 
on 
the 
enterprise sector.

Current 
Status. 
As 
stated 
in 
the 
TSSU, 
the 
real 
sector 
in 
Serbia 
is 
in 
very poor condition. 
The 
past 
decade 
brought 
macroeconomic  instability, 
loss 
of 
markets,  and 
isolation 
from 
technological 
advances. 
The 
mass 
of 
productive 
assets 
tied 
up 
in 
socially- 
or 
state-owned 
firms 
requires 
change 
of 
ownership 
and, 
in 
many 
cases, 
restructuring 
if 
these 
firms 
are 
to 
survive 
and 
compete 
in 
open, 
global 
markets 
(see 
Box 
3). 
The 
MOEP 
and 
the 
PA 
have 
the 
mandate 
to 
offer for 
sale 
the 
capital 
or 
property 
of 
about 
4,000 
SOEs 
over 
the 
next 
three 
years. 
Among 
these 
SOEs, 
some 
100 
companies can 
be 
privatized 
through 
tenders 
to 
strategic investors. 
Another 
1,500 
to 
2,000 
companies can 
be 
sold through 
auctions 
and 
a 
limited 
number 
(probably 
less 
that 
100) 
can 
be 
restructured 
and 
privatized, 
all 
or 
in 
part. 
The 
remaining 
companies 
will 
have 
to 
be  subject 
to 
bankruptcy 
under 
the 
new 
insolvency  legal 
and 
institutional 
framework 
described 
in 
Section 
1II.A 
above. 
The 
initial 
progress made 
by 
the 
PA 
in 
implementing 
the 
Government’s 
ambitious 
privatization 
program 
has 
been 
considerable, 
although 
in 
some 
areas 
(see 
below),  serious 
problems 
remain 
and 
if 
not 
resolved, 
will 
undermine 
the 
process. 
58. 
Government’s 
Reform 
Program. 
The 
Serbian 
privatization 
strategy 
is 
based 
on 
the 
new 
Privatization 
Law 
adopted, 
with 
the 
Bank 
support, 
in 
June 
200 
1, 
and 
incorporating 
the 
international 
best 
practice and 
lessons 
learned 
from 
other 
transition 
economies. 
The 
law 
requires 
offering 
to 
a strategic 
investor 
at  least 
70 
percent 
of 
the 
shares. 
An 
amendment 
to 
the 
Privatization 
Law, 
adopted 
by 
the 
Parliament 
in 
March 
2003, 
provides 
full 
and 
exclusive 
authority 
to 
the 
PA 
to 
negotiate 
and 
sign 
sale 
and 
purchase 
agreements. 
This 
is 
a 
major 
achievement 
because, 
due 
to 
the 
legacy 
of 
social 
ownership, before 
the 
amendment, employees’  representatives 
could 
refuse 
to 
sign 
the 
agreements 
if 
they 
did 
not 
like 
the 
investor 
who 
won 
the 
tender. 
The 
law 
stipulates three methods 
of 
privatization: 
(i) 
privatization 
tenders 
of 
large 
enterprises; 
(ii) 
auctions 
of 
medium 
enterprises; 
and 
(iii) 
restructuring 
and 
subsequent 
tenders and/or 
auctions 
of 
large 
loss-making 
enterprises and/or 
part 
thereof. 
Tender 
privatization 
is 
used 
for 
SOEs 
that 
are 
sufficiently 
large, 
important 
and 
attractive 
to 
require 
the 
case-by-case 
approach 
for 
their 
privatization. 
The 
auctions 
program 
has 
been 
designed 
to 
address 
the 
structural 
difficulty which 
has 
been 
faced 
in 
many 
transition 
economies 
of 
privatizing 
in 
a 
relatively 
short 
period 
of 
time 
a large 
number 
of 
companies, 
while 
the 
domestic 
purchasing 
power 
is 
very 
limited, 
by 
insisting 
on 
cash 
payments 
but 
allowing 
extended 
payments 
and 
the 
use 
of 
government 
bonds 
(issued 
in 
exchange 
of 
the 
frozen 
foreign 
exchange deposits). 
Finally, 
large 
loss-making 
SOEs 
that 
cannot be 
sold 
through auction 
or 
tender 
in 
their current 
condition 
(due 
to 
excessive employment, 
heavy 
debt 
burden, 
etc.) 
are 
required 
under 
the 
Privatization 
Law 
to 
undergo 
“privatization through 
restructuring.”  The 
legal framework 
for 
restructuring 
is 
elaborated 
in 
the 
Restructuring 
Decree 
that 
stipulates 
the 
procedures 
for 
reorganization, 
dealing 
with 
creditors 
and 
debt, 
management 
of 
the 
company 
during 
restructuring 
and 
deadlines 
for 
third 
parties 
to 
meet 
the 
requirements 
of 
the 
decree. 
59. 
Auction 
Privatization. 
Following 
a 
revision 
of 
the 
Auctions 
Decree 
in 
July 
2002, 
which 
simplified 
the 
process 
and 
reduced 
the 
unreasonable 
starting 
prices,  the 
program 
has 
been 
moving 
forward 
with 
new 
momentum. 
Auctions 
now 
start 
with 
cash 
and 
move 
to 
the 
bonds 
for 
frozen 
foreign 
exchange deposits, 
if 
no 
cash 
bids 
are made. 
This 
flexible 
approach 
has 
greatly 
increased 
the 
participation 
in 
auctions 
and 
has 
led 
to 
a 
success 
rate 
of 
about 
70 
percent, 
with 
the 
PA 
now 
running 
two 
auctions 
a 
week. 
In 
the 
first 
half 
of 
2003, 
500 
companies 
will 
be 
sold, 
with 
another 560 expected 
to 
be 
sold 
by 
end 
of 
2003. 
The 
average 
selling 
price 
of 
the 
companies 
offered 
in 
auction 
averages 
about 
Euro 
300,000. 
The 
19 
Page  25
Government 
is 
already setting 
up 
new 
capacity 
to 
help 
manage 
the 
program 
for 
the 
next 
1,000 
companies 
when 
the 
first 
1,000 
auctions 
are 
finished. 
Box 
3: 
Privatization 
of 
Socially-Owned 
Enterwises 
in 
Serbia 
The 
bulk 
of 
the 
real 
sector 
in 
Serbia 
has 
been 
organized 
as 
socially 
owned 
enterprises 
(SOEs). 
In 
the 
SOEs, 
workers 
collectively 
hold 
major 
rights to 
management and 
disposal 
of 
enterprise 
assets 
or 
residual income. This 
unique 
form 
of 
industrial 
organization contributed to Yugoslavia’s earlier economic 
successes, 
but 
is 
inappropriate and 
ineffective 
in 
a market economy. 
Dismantling 
this 
system and 
replacing 
it 
with 
more 
efficient 
and 
competitive forms 
of 
ownership 
and 
operation 
represents 
a 
key 
challenge 
for 
the 
Government. 
The 
first 
attempt 
to 
change 
social 
ownership 
had 
been 
made 
in 
1989 
when 
the 
first 
Yugoslav 
law 
was 
passed 
allowing 
firms 
to 
be 
privatized 
by 
employees. 
In 
1994, an 
amendment 
of 
the 
privatization 
law 
revalued capital, reversing 
much 
of 
the 
privatization 
that had 
taken 
place, 
resulting 
in 
popular 
discontent, extensive 
litigation, 
and 
a completely 
failed 
attempt 
at 
privatization. 
In 
July 
1997, 
the 
Serbian 
Govemment 
adopted 
the 
Act 
on Ownership Transformation. 
Once again, 
the 
employees were 
given 
a 
right 
to 
decide 
whether 
or 
not to initiate privatization. 
As 
a 
result, 
firms 
distributed for 
free, 
or 
sold 
at 
a large 
discount, 
90 
percent 
of 
the 
shares 
to 
employees and 
pensioners. 
By 
the 
time 
1997 
Law 
had 
been 
replaced 
the 
new 
Privatization 
Law 
in 
2001, 
approximately 
one 
thousand 
enterprises 
completed 
the 
sale 
process. 
Currently 
the 
PA 
is 
trying 
to 
complete 
the 
privatization 
of 
residual 
stakes 
in 
these 
1000 
companies 
in 
parallel 
to 
its 
main 
program. 
In 
2002, 
it 
sold 
minority 
shares 
in 
48 
companies 
privatized 
under 
the 
1997 
Law 
for total worth 
of 
Euro 
82 
million. 
Experience 
in 
other 
post-socialist 
economies 
has 
shown 
the 
difficulty 
in 
selling 
residual 
minority 
shares 
in 
enterprises 
dominated 
by 
insiders, 
with 
little 
protection 
for 
shareholders 
rights 
and 
limited 
possibility 
of 
exit17. 
Moreover, 
the 
removal 
of 
these 
higher-quality 
1000 
enterprises 
made 
the 
current 
privatization 
program 
more 
difficult 
because 
many 
good 
firms 
have already 
been 
removed fi-om 
the 
market. 
In 
designing 
the 
new program 
in 
2001, the 
authorities’ 
primary 
criterion 
for 
selecting 
the 
method 
of 
privatization 
of 
the 
enterprise 
(or 
its 
restructuring 
via 
the 
sale 
of 
its 
parts 
or 
assets) 
was 
its 
capability 
to  place 
core, 
competent, 
concentrated owners 
in 
charge 
of 
the 
assets. 
An 
important 
secondary 
consideration 
was 
the 
capacity 
of 
the 
method 
to 
impose 
hard 
budget constraints 
by 
breaking 
apart 
or 
selling 
assets 
of 
indebted 
companies 
(lest 
policies 
to 
support 
them 
impact negatively 
private 
sector 
growth 
and 
production). 
The 
current 
Privatization 
Program, 
promulgated 
in 
the 
200 
1 
Law 
and 
its 
2003 
Amendment, 
is 
designed 
to 
achieve 
these 
goals 
through 
its 
multi-track 
approach: 
(i) 
tenders 
to 
attract 
foreign 
strategic 
investors 
to 
large 
companies; 
(ii) 
auctions 
to 
offer 
SMEs 
to 
other 
investors; and 
(iii) 
restructuring 
to 
break 
up 
hard- 
to-sell, 
failing 
firms 
with 
the 
help 
of 
international 
or 
local 
financial 
advisors 
and 
put 
their 
assets 
to productive 
use; 
and 
(iv) 
bankruptcy 
of 
the 
SOEs 
that 
could 
not 
be 
dealt 
with 
under any 
of 
the 
other 
three 
methods. 
In 
many 
cases, 
methods 
(iii) 
and 
(iv) 
encourage 
the 
entry 
and 
expansion 
of 
de 
novo 
private 
firms, 
which 
purchase the 
assets 
of 
the 
restructured 
or 
bankrupt 
enterprises. 
Two 
major 
problems 
stem 
from 
this 
legacy 
of 
the 
Yugoslav  “social  ownership” 
and 
the 
failed 
privatization 
programs 
of 
the 
1990s: 
(i) 
the 
power 
of 
the trade 
unions 
and 
the 
management and 
employees 
of 
the 
enterprise 
which could 
(until 
the 
2003 
amendment) 
block 
the 
sale 
and 
who 
insist 
on 
generous 
social 
post-privatization 
commitments 
to 
be 
made 
by 
the 
buyer 
at 
the 
time 
of 
the 
transaction; and 
(ii) 
an 
overhang 
of 
debts 
to 
banks, 
utilities, 
tax authorities, social 
funds and 
trade 
creditors. 
60. 
Tender 
Privatization. 
The 
tender 
program 
was designed 
to 
sell the larger 
companies 
that 
are 
still 
majority 
socially-owned 
after 
about 
1,000 
best companies 
had 
been 
sold 
to 
insiders 
during 
the 
Milosevic 
period. 
Therefore, 
attracting 
foreign 
investors 
for 
the 
remaining 
companies, 
although 
critical 
for 
development, 
remains 
a 
challenge. 
Under 
the 
tender 
program 
managed 
by 
the 
PA 
with 
the 
help 
of 
TA 
provided 
by 
the 
Bank 
and 
other 
donors, 
twelve 
groups 
(pools), 
comprising 
55 
companies, 
have 
now 
been 
contracted 
to 
investment 
banks. 
The 
PA 
is 
looking for 
better 
strategy 
to deal 
with 
these 
residual 
minority 
shares, 
including for 
example,  an 
investment vehicle that 
would 
buy 
out 
employee 
shareholders 
to 
offer 
their 
shares 
for 
sale 
alongside 
the 
remaining 
socially owned 
shares, 
thereby creating 
an 
attractive investment 
package.

Page  26
61. 
The 
Government 
identified 
two 
main 
obstacles 
that  slowed 
the 
initial 
progress 
of 
the 
tender 
program: 
(i) 
excessive company 
staffing 
levels;  and 
(ii) 
overly 
ambitious 
social program 
requirements 
imposed 
on 
the 
potential 
investors. 
The 
excessive 
staffing 
levels 
and 
mandatory social programs 
reflect 
the 
legacy 
of 
the Yugoslav social ownership 
philosophy 
under 
which 
employees 
and 
managers 
share 
the 
fortunes 
of 
the 
company 
and dominate 
the 
decision 
making 
process. 
However, 
the 
experience 
of 
the 
initial 
failed 
tenders 
has 
demonstrated that 
the 
social 
programs deterred buyers, 
as 
they 
were 
required 
to 
guarantee 
employment 
for 
three 
to 
five 
years 
to 
redundant employees. Consequently, 
the 
Government 
decided 
to 
reduce 
the 
requirement 
that 
the 
buyers 
retain 
all 
employees 
for 
five 
years 
(three 
years 
for 
some 
companies) 
to 
one year and 
to 
commit 
to 
pay 
an 
agreed 
level 
of 
severance 
to 
redundant employees 
as 
part 
of 
the 
sale 
agreement. 
These 
revised 
terms 
would 
be 
made 
known 
to 
buyers 
as 
part 
of 
the 
tender 
documentation 
and 
the 
Government’s 
commitments 
regarding 
severance 
payments 
would 
be 
made 
effective 
at the 
time 
of 
the 
sale. 
The 
estimated annual cost 
of 
redundancies 
for 
companies expected 
to 
be 
sold 
in 
the 
year 2003 
is 
about 
US$17.2 
million 
or 
1.1 
billion 
dinars18. 
In 
addition, 
the 
Government 
revised 
its 
scoring 
system 
for 
the 
tender 
results 
to 
exclude 
a 
weighting for 
the 
social 
program 
offered 
by 
buyers. 
The  revised  scoring 
is 
now 
100 
percent 
credit 
for 
cash  and  a  20  percent 
credit 
for 
investment 
commitments. 
The 
companies 
in 
the 
tender 
program 
that have 
not 
yet 
been 
tendered 
will 
be 
offered 
with 
the 
new 
social 
terms 
and 
conditions 
as 
will 
those that 
did 
not 
sell 
in 
previous 
tenders. 
Depending 
on 
their 
size 
and 
financial 
condition, 
enterprises 
that 
attract 
no 
satisfactory bids 
in 
the 
tender process 
will 
be 
either 
auctioned, 
or 
put 
into 
restructuring, 
or 
put 
into 
bankruptcy. 
62. 
The 
Government 
is 
also 
undertaking 
some 
privatizations 
using 
its 
own 
financing. 
For 
example, a 
number 
of 
sugar 
companies 
are 
being 
privatized 
as 
well 
as 
Beopetrol, 
an 
oil 
distribution 
company. 
The 
Government 
has 
also opened tenders 
for 
two 
tobacco companies, and 
is 
considering 
selling 
its 
interest 
in 
Mobtel, 
a 
mobile 
telephone company. Sartid, a large and 
heavily 
indebted 
steel producer, was 
placed 
in 
bankruptcy 
under 
the 
old 
Bankruptcy 
Law 
and 
the 
bankruptcy 
administrator 
has 
entered 
into 
an 
agreement 
with 
US 
Steel 
to 
purchase and/or manage 
certain 
components. 
The 
Government 
has 
committed 
itself 
to 
keep 
the 
Bank 
informed 
on 
progress 
for 
these 
privatizations 
and 
to 
use open, 
transparent  and 
competitive 
methods 
in 
their 
sale. 
63. 
Enterprise Restructuring. 
As 
of 
March 
2003, 
50 
large 
problematic 
SOEs 
have been 
tentatively 
selected 
by 
the 
Government 
to 
undergo 
privatization 
through  restructuring  according 
to 
relevant 
provisions 
contained 
in 
the 
Privatization 
Law 
and 
the 
Restructuring 
Decree. 
Using 
the 
technical 
assistance 
funding 
provided 
by 
the 
Bank 
and other 
donors 
(USAID, 
European 
Agency 
for 
Reconstruction, 
UK 
Department 
for 
International 
Development), 
the 
PA 
is 
currently 
in 
the 
process 
of 
engaging 
internationally 
reputed 
teams 
of 
financial 
advisors 
to 
lead  the  preparation 
and 
iinplementation 
of 
privatization 
through restructuring 
programs 
for 
most 
of 
the 
companies 
on 
the 
list 
of 
50. 
In 
particular, 
under 
the 
recently 
approved Bank’s 
TA 
Credit, 
the 
PA 
has engaged 
financial  advisors 
to 
work 
on 
four 
large 
SOEs 
in 
its 
portfolio, 
with 
advisors 
for 
three 
more 
conglomerates 
to 
be 
hired 
by 
mid-2003. 
64. 
Government’s 
restructuring 
strategy 
calls 
for 
the 
segmentation 
(in 
a 
typical 
case) 
of 
the 
company, 
incorporation 
of 
new 
companies created 
from 
parts 
of 
the 
old 
one, 
and 
sale 
of 
these 
new 
companies 
and 
assets 
remaining 
after 
the 
break 
up. 
This 
process 
will 
consist 
of 
three 
stages: 
(i) 
a 
feasibility 
study 
and a 
due 
diligence 
report, 
serving 
as 
the 
basis 
for 
preparation 
of 
the 
restructuring program 
by 
financial 
advisors; 
(ii) 
implementation 
of 
financial, 
organizational,  legal, and 
workforce 
restructuring, 
including 
(if 
necessary) 
the 
incorporation 
of 
the 
new 
companies created 
from 
parts 
of 
the 
old 
one and 
negotiations 
with 
creditors; 
and 
(iii) 
privatization 
of 
the 
saleable 
business 
units 
by 
tender 
or 
auction,  and 
disposing 
of 
all 
other 
assets 
remaining 
after 
the 
reorganization through bankruptcy 
procedures. 
This 
model 
will 
be based

The 
assumptions

on 
a transaction-oriented 
approach, 
where 
the 
ultimate 
sale 
of 
the 
enterprise 
or 
its 
various 
viable 
parts 
drives 
the 
restructuring effort. The 
underlying 
premise 
of 
this 
exercise 
is 
that 
various 
subsidiaries and/or 
assets 
of 
loss-making 
SOEs 
can 
be 
viable 
and attractive 
to 
potential 
investors even 
if 
as 
a 
whole 
these 
conglomerates 
are 
presently 
non-viable 
and non-saleable. 
The Government 
expects 
to 
have 
the 
first 
sales 
resulting 
from 
restructuring program 
in 
the 
second 
half 
of 
2003.

Enterprise 
debts 
work-out. 
Central 
to 
the 
successful 
implementation 
of 
enterprise 
and 
banking 
sectors 
reform 
program 
lies 
the need 
to 
deal 
with 
the 
excessive 
debt 
burden 
present 
in 
the 
economy, 
which 
affects both: 
(i) 
bank 
privatization, 
where 
prospective 
buyers 
-- 
traditionally 
strategic 
investors 
-- 
normally would 
prefer 
banks 
to 
be 
cleansed 
of 
their 
non-performing loan 
portfolios 
before 
the 
sale;  and, 
(ii) 
enterprise 
privatization 
because 
the 
ability 
of 
the 
PA 
to 
restructure 
and/or 
privatize 
larger 
enterprises 
is 
heavily 
affected 
by 
its 
ability 
to 
secure 
the 
agreement 
of 
creditors 
of 
the 
enterprises. 
The 
creditors’ 
agreement 
to 
compromise 
their 
claims 
is 
based 
on 
the 
principle 
that the 
enterprise 
to 
be 
privatized 
is 
worth 
more 
to 
creditors 
when 
sold 
as 
a 
going 
concern rather 
than when 
liquidated. 
In 
many 
cases, 
tender 
privatization 
and 
privatization 
through 
restructuring 
of 
companies 
on 
going 
concern 
basis 
will 
require 
pre-privatization 
financial 
restructuring, 
which 
will 
make companies 
more attractive 
to 
potential 
buyers. 
The 
Government 
realizes 
that 
if 
the 
problem 
of 
excessive 
indebtedness 
of 
firms 
in 
the 
privatization 
program 
is 
not 
dealt 
with, 
the 
privatization 
and 
restructuring  objectives 
will 
not 
be 
achieved 
and 
economic 
growth 
will 
be negatively 
affected. 
Accordingly, important 
progress 
in 
developing 
mechanisms 
to 
facilitate 
creditor 
compromise 
has 
been 
made:

The 
2001 
Privatization 
Law 
contains 
provisions 
for 
an 
out 
of 
court 
mechanism 
to 
restructure 
the 
indebtedness 
of 
qualifying 
enterprises 
as 
an 
integral part 
of 
their 
privatization. 
If 
the 
enterprise 
is 
restructured,  under 
the 
restructuring 
provisions 
of 
the 
Privatization 
Law 
it 
is 
intended that a 
majority 
of 
the 
creditors 
voting 
on 
a 
plan 
can 
bind 
the 
dissenting 
minority. 
In 
2001, 
the 
Government 
issued 
a 
series 
of 
decrees 
which 
allowed 
the 
MOFE 
to 
write 
off 
most 
historical tax 
debts 
of 
enterprises at 
the 
time 
of 
their 
privatization. 
The 
PA 
and 
the 
BRA 
(in 
its 
capacity 
as 
bankruptcy 
trustee 
of 
several 
large 
banks) 
in 
December 
2002 
entered 
into 
a 
Memorandum 
of 
Understanding 
(MOU) which 
addresses 
the 
manner 
in 
which 
the 
BRA 
will 
fulfill 
its 
obligations 
to 
the 
courts 
and 
the 
creditors 
of 
the 
bankrupt 
banks 
in 
a 
manner 
that 
does 
not 
impede 
the 
privatization 
of 
socially owned 
enterprises. Expressed 
very 
simply, 
the 
MOU 
stipulates 
that 
the 
BRA 
will 
allow 
an enterprise 
to 
be 
sold 
free 
and clear 
of 
amounts 
owing 
to 
the 
bankrupt 
banks, 
in 
exchange 
for 
a  negotiated 
percentage 
of 
the 
proceeds 
from 
the 
sale.

The 
Serbian 
authorities 
recognize 
that 
for 
the 
enterprise 
restructuring 
and 
privatization 
program 
to 
function 
effectively, 
and 
to 
allow 
the 
privatization 
of 
the 
PLC 
Law-affected 
banks 
to 
proceed 
smoothly, 
a mechanism 
similar 
to 
the 
MOU 
will 
have 
to 
be 
put 
in 
place 
to 
bring 
these 
claims 
within 
the 
“umbrella” 
of 
the 
MOU 
program. 
The 
authorities 
are 
now 
working 
to 
develop a 
strategy 
and 
legal 
and 
institutional 
mechanisms 
to 
integrate 
the 
resolution 
of 
claims 
on 
enterprises 
held 
by 
the 
PLC 
Law- 
affected 
banks, 
the 
public 
utilities, 
and 
various 
public 
funds 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
the 
enterprise 
restructuring 
and 
privatization 
program. Based 
on 
this 
strategy and 
the 
lessons 
from 
the 
first 
cases 
of 
restructuring, the Government plans 
to 
introduce additional 
amendments 
to 
the 
Privatization 
Law, 
PLC 
Law, 
and various  supporting 
decrees 
to 
provide 
the 
legal 
basis 
for 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
above- 
mentioned 
strategy, 
apply 
similar 
arrangements 
to 
other creditors,  and 
thus 
enhance 
the 
privatization 
of 
indebted 
enterprises. 
67. 
Dealing 
with  Social 
Costs. 
An 
integral part 
of 
the 
Government’s 
reform 
program 
will 
be 
to 
address 
the 
social 
impact 
of 
restructuring 
and 
privatization. 
As 
mentioned 
above, 
the 
reform 
of 
SOE 
sector 
is 
likely 
to 
be 
accompanied 
by 
major 
labor 
displacement 
(for 
additional 
discussion 
of 
this 
impact, 
22 
Page  28
see 
Section 
V.F 
below). 
The 
privatization 
or restructuring 
program for 
each enterprise prepared 
with 
the 
help 
of 
financial 
advisors 
will 
include 
a 
labor redeployment plan, 
which 
will 
outline 
severance 
or 
other 
packages 
for 
redundant 
workers 
and receive 
financing 
from 
the 
Serbian 
budget. 
68. 
Enterprise-specific 
programs 
would 
be 
guided 
by 
the 
policy 
framework 
outlined 
in 
the 
Government’s 
Social 
Program 
for 
employees 
dismissed 
during 
restructuring 
and 
privatization,  approved 
by 
the 
Government 
in 
March 
2002. 
The 
Program 
is 
intended 
to 
provide 
a 
menu 
of 
compensation 
and 
redeployment options 
for 
dismissed 
workers 
in 
the 
large 
SOEs. 
The 
Program provides 
a 
unified 
approach 
for 
dealing 
with 
social 
costs 
of 
transition 
and 
minimizes 
the 
prospects 
of 
ad 
hoc 
settlements 
for 
dismissed 
workers 
across 
different 
sectors. 
Retrenched 
workers 
may 
choose between: 
(i) 
a 
lump-sum  payment 
of 
60,000 
dinars (around 
US$lOOO) 
or 
6000 dinars (around 
US$ 
100) 
per 
year 
of 
service 
(whichever 
is 
higher); 
and 
(ii) 
payment 
for 
up 
to 
two 
years, 
depending 
on 
length 
of 
service, at 40-80  percent 
of 
the 
average 
wage 
in 
Serbia. 
This 
package 
is 
generous 
relative 
to 
the 
packages 
given 
to 
workers 
in 
companies 
outside the 
Social 
Program: 
under 
the 
first 
option, 
workers 
get about 
14 average 
monthly 
wages, 
or 
on 
average 
about 
three 
times 
more 
than 
the 
minimum 
specified 
in 
the 
Labor 
Law. 
However, 
it 
is 
less 
generous 
than 
packages 
offered 
to 
facilitate 
large-scale 
restructuring 
in 
other 
transition 
economies. 
The 
2003 
budget includes 
an 
allocation 
of 
7.5 
billion 
dinars 
(equivalent 
to 
US$l25 
million, 
or 
0.8 percent 
of 
projected GDP) 
to 
provide 
the 
payments 
to 
employees 
of 
companies 
covered 
by 
the 
Social Program. 
An 
analogous 
allocation 
is 
expected 
to 
be 
provided 
in 
the 
next 
year’s budget. 
In 
parallel 
to 
these 
efforts, 
and 
supported 
by 
the 
Bank 
under 
SOSAC, 
the 
Government 
has 
proposed 
reforms 
to 
the 
social protection 
system 
to 
improve 
its 
immediate 
and 
medium-term 
effectiveness. 
In 
addition, 
the 
technical 
assistance 
provided 
to 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Labor 
and 
Employment 
under 
the 
Bank’s 
Employment Promotion 
Project 
is 
expected 
to 
facilitate 
monitoring 
the 
effect 
of 
the 
privatization 
and 
restructuring 
programs. 
69. 
Following 
the 
announcement 
of 
the 
Social 
Program, 
the 
Bank 
held 
extensive 
discussions 
with 
the 
Government 
pertaining 
both 
to 
overall 
costs 
of 
the 
program 
and 
microeconomic  incentive 
issues. 
Specifically, 
the 
questions 
of 
adverse 
selection, over-payment, 
and 
moral 
hazard 
were 
discussed. 
Adverse 
selection 
is 
contained 
in 
privatizeable 
enterprises 
in 
which 
wage 
increases are 
expected 
while 
moral 
hazard 
is 
mitigated 
by 
contractual 
arrangements 
to 
limit 
rehiring 
of 
laid 
off 
employees 
who 
received 
severance 
pay. 
The 
Government 
agreed 
to 
the 
need 
to 
keep 
the 
overall 
cost 
of 
the 
program 
in 
check. 
In 
order 
to 
minimize 
the 
microeconomic 
distortions 
it 
agreed 
to 
prioritize 
the 
payment 
of 
retrenchment 
benefits 
to 
workers 
from 
those companies 
that 
are 
undergoing credible 
restructuring through 
privatization 
or 
bankruptcy.  Specifically, 
under 
the 
SOSAC 
LDP, 
the 
Government 
committed 
as 
follows: 
“With 
respect 
to 
the 
Social 
Program, 
we 
intend 
to 
ensure 
that 
fiscal 
costs 
are 
kept 
under 
control 
in 
the 
short 
run 
and 
reduced 
and 
eventually  discontinued 
in 
the 
medium 
term. 
In 
the 
short 
run, 
we 
plan 
to 
make 
the 
payments  under 
the 
Social 
Program  more 
explicitly  linked 
to 
specific 
benchmarks 
in 
enterprise 
restructuring 
and 
tender 
privatization 
process, 
such 
as 
the 
adoption 
by 
the 
PA 
of 
the 
enterprise 
restructuring 
and 
privatization 
programs, 
in 
order 
to 
ensure 
that 
public 
resources are  spent 
only 
on 
enterprises 
which 
are 
fully 
committed 
to 
fundamental 
restructuring 
and change 
of 
ownership.”

Nationalizedproperty. 
In 
the 
case 
of 
assets 
that 
are 
subject 
to 
privatization, 
the 
Privatization 
Law 
adopted 
in 
June 
200 
1 established 
the 
principle 
of 
compensation 
for 
nationalized 
property 
in 
money 
rather 
than 
in 
kind 
(Article 
15) 
and allocated 
5 
percent 
from 
privatization 
proceeds 
for 
compensation. 
The 
Government 
has 
recently 
established a 
working 
group 
under 
the 
MOFE 
that 
will 
draft 
a 
new 
Law 
on 
Denationalization. 
Following 
a 
participatory 
process 
of 
extensive 
consultation 
and 
taking 
into 
account 
public 
commentary, the Government 
intends 
to 
submit 
a 
draft 
law 
on 
restitution 
for 
consideration 
to 
the 
Parliament 
by 
December 
2003. 
While 
the 
details 
of 
the 
law 
are 
still 
to 
be 
worked 
out, 
the 
law 
would 
be 
based 
on 
the 
following 
general 
principles: 
(i) 
compensation 
will 
be 
done, 
as 
a 
matter 
of 
general 
policy, 
through 
bonds, 
and 
will 
be 
substantially 
in 
accordance 
with 
principles 
of 
2001 
Privatization Law; 
(ii) 
compensation 
will 
be 
done 
in 
a 
fiscally 
prudent 
manner; and 
(iii) 
to 
avoid 
the 
creation 
of 
new 
injustices, 
23 
Page  29
the 
legally owned 
non-state 
property shall 
not 
be 
restituted 
(in 
kind) 
to 
original 
owners; 
other 
forms 
of 
compensation 
will 
be 
used.

1. 
Medium-term  reform 
objectives. 
The 
Government  strongly 
believes  that 
completion 
of 
restructuring 
and 
privatization 
of 
the 
socially- 
and state-owned enterprise  sector 
is 
a 
pre-requisite 
for 
achieving 
sustainable economic 
growth 
in 
Serbia. 
Accordingly, 
the 
following 
medium 
term 
agenda 
is 
envisioned 
for 
2004-2005: 
0 
0 
Tender  and 
auction 
privatization 
programs 
will 
be 
continued 
in 
a 
transparent, 
competitive 
manner, 
as 
provided 
for 
in 
the 
Privatization 
Law 
and 
related 
regulations. 
Restructuring 
and 
subsequent 
privatization 
of 
large 
industrial 
conglomerates 
will 
be 
continued 
and 
accelerated once 
the 
effective legislative 
and 
regulatory framework 
for 
debt 
workout 
is 
fully 
put 
into 
place. Unsaleable conglomerates 
and/or 
parts 
thereof 
will 
be 
put 
into 
bankruptcy 
under 
the 
new 
insolvency 
regime. 
In 
parallel 
to 
continuing 
the 
privatization 
and 
restructuring 
of 
socially-owned 
enterprises,  the 
Government 
plans 
to 
accelerate 
the 
reform 
of 
the 
troubled 
state 
sector 
of 
the 
economy. 
A 
number 
of 
the 
state-owned 
enterprises 
will 
be 
privatization 
candidates 
over 
the 
medium 
term 
once 
their 
restructuring 
is 
further 
advanced and  satisfactory 
regulatory 
regimes 
have 
been 
put 
in 
place. 
Enterprises 
that 
would 
be 
considered 
for 
privatization 
are: 
(i) 
electricity 
generation, 
once 
unbundled 
and satisfactory 
regulation 
is 
in 
place; 
(ii) 
telecommunications; 
(iii) 
oil 
refining 
and 
distribution; 
and 
(iv) 
gas 
distribution. Privatization 
of 
railways 
and ports, 
including 
airports, 
are 
further 
in 
the 
future.

THE 
PROPOSED 
CREDIT 
72. 
This 
section provides a 
summary 
of 
the 
proposed 
credit including: 
(i) 
details 
on 
the 
credit 
and 
its 
implementation 
arrangements; 
(ii) 
proposed 
Board 
conditions 
and  tranche 
triggers; 
(iii) 
borrower’s 
commitment 
and 
ownership; 
(iv)  coordination 
with 
the 
IMF 
and other 
donors; 
(v) 
lessons 
learned 
from 
previous 
Bank 
operations; 
(vi) 
benefits and 
risks; 
(vii) 
poverty  implications; 
and 
(viii) 
environmental 
impact. 
The 
broad 
rationale 
and 
objectives 
of 
the 
credit,  and 
its 
links 
to 
the 
Bank’s 
TSSU, 
are already 
given 
in

Credit Amount, Borrower,  Terms, 
Tranching. 
The 
proposed 
PFSAC 
11 
Credit 
amount 
is 
SDR 
58.7 
million 
(US$80 
million 
equivalent). 
The 
credit 
would 
be made 
to 
SAM, 
represented 
by 
the 
SAM 
Ministry 
for 
External 
Economic 
Relations 
(MEER). 
The 
ultimate beneficiary 
will 
be 
Serbia, 
represented 
by 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Finance and 
Economy. The credit 
will 
be 
on 
modified 
IDA 
terms, 
with 
a 
maturity 
of 
20 
years 
including 
a 
grace 
period 
of 
10 
years 
with 
no 
acceleration 
clause. 
It 
is 
proposed 
to 
disburse 
the 
Credit 
in 
two 
equal 
tranches.

Disbursements. 
The 
first 
tranche 
would 
be 
released 
upon 
approval 
of 
the 
Credit 
and 
notification 
by 
the 
Bank 
of 
Credit 
Agreement  Effectiveness. 
The 
SAM 
MEER 
will 
open and 
maintain 
a 
special 
Deposit Account 
in 
the 
NBS 
on 
terms 
and 
conditions 
satisfactory 
to 
the 
Bank. 
Upon 
notification 
by 
the 
Bank 
of 
Credit 
Effectiveness and submission 
to 
the 
Bank 
of 
a 
withdrawal 
application, 
the proceeds 
of 
the 
first 
tranche 
of 
the 
Credit 
will 
be 
deposited 
by 
the 
Bank into 
the 
Deposit 
Account 
of 
the 
SAM 
MEER. 
The 
Borrower 
will 
make available 
to 
Serbia 
in 
Dinar to 
its 
general 
budgetary account 
the 
equivalent 
of 
the 
proceeds 
of 
the 
Credit 
under 
terms 
and 
conditions 
satisfactory 
to 
the 
Bank. 
Following 
the 
approval 
of 
these 
terms 
and 
conditions 
by 
Serbia, 
the 
Borrower 
will 
then 
enact 
a 
law 
related 
to 
the 
above 
arrangements 
which 
is 
satisfactory 
to 
the 
Bank 
(a 
condition 
of 
effectiveness). 
If, 
after  deposit 
in 
the 
24 
Page  30
Deposit 
Account, 
the 
proceeds 
of 
the credit 
are 
used 
for 
ineligible 
purposes 
(i.e. 
to 
finance 
items 
imported 
from 
non-member 
countries, 
or 
goods and services 
from 
the 
Bank’s 
standard 
negative 
list), 
the 
Bank 
will 
require 
the 
Borrower to 
either: 
(i) 
return 
the 
amount 
to 
the 
account 
for 
use 
for 
eligible

75. 
Implementation and 
Monitoring. 
During 
credit 
preparation, 
the 
Bank 
has assisted 
the 
SAM 
and 
Serbian 
governments 
to 
ensure 
timely 
implementation 
of 
the 
agreed 
reforms. 
To 
assess 
the 
impact 
of 
the 
proposed  operation, 
and 
in 
conjunction 
with 
parallel 
policy-based 
operations, 
the 
Bank 
will 
monitor 
progress 
in 
meeting 
the 
outcome 
benchmarks 
(see 
Policy 
Matrix 
in 
Annex 
5) 
and 
implementing 
the 
medium-term 
reform 
strategy described 
in 
the 
LDP 
(Annex 
4). 
The 
NBS, 
with 
the 
assistance 
from 
the 
BRA, 
will 
bear 
the 
primary 
responsibility 
for 
providing 
the 
Bank 
with 
evidence 
concerning 
the 
progress 
in 
financial 
sector reforms,  and 
the 
MOEP, 
assisted 
by 
the 
PA, 
will 
be 
the 
Bank’s 
main 
counterpart 
on 
the 
enterprise sector 
reform 
agenda. 
The 
SAM 
and Serbian governments are aware 
that 
such progress 
will 
be 
evaluated 
beyond 
the 
implementation period 
of 
the 
proposed operation,  and 
will 
constitute 
the 
basis 
for 
preparation 
of 
potential 
follow-up 
Bank 
operations 
or 
components 
of 
future 
operations 
in 
these 
areas, 
This 
impact 
assessment 
will 
be 
conducted 
jointly 
between 
staff 
of 
the 
Bank 
Office 
in 
Belgrade 
and 
headquarters-based 
staff. 
76. 
Reporting, Accounting and Auditing. 
The 
NBS 
would 
maintain 
records 
of 
all 
transactions 
under 
the 
credit 
in 
accordance 
with 
sound 
accounting 
practices. 
Upon 
the 
request 
of 
the 
Bank, 
the 
NBS 
will 
prepare a 
report showing 
all 
payments 
into 
and 
from 
the 
Deposit Account 
and 
will 
have 
the 
report 
audited 
by 
independent 
auditors 
acceptable 
to 
the 
Bank, 
in 
accordance 
with 
terms 
of 
reference acceptable 
to 
the 
Bank. 
The 
Borrower 
should 
furnish 
the 
audited 
report 
not 
later than 
four months 
after the 
date 
of 
Bank’s 
request 
for 
such an 
audit. 
77. 
Fiduciary 
and 
accountability 
environment. 
The 
recent 
Country  Financial  Accountability 
Assessment 
(CFAA) 
undertook 
an  analysis 
of 
both  public 
financial  accountability 
and 
fiduciary 
considerations 
related 
to 
use 
of 
Bank 
funds 
in 
SAM. 
On 
fiduciary 
considerations 
on 
use 
of 
Bank 
funds, 
the 
review 
of 
the 
NBY 
as 
a deposit  account 
holder 
indicated 
that 
SAM 
had 
appropriate  capacity 
to 
manage 
IDA 
credits, 
understood 
the 
flow 
of 
funds, 
and 
had 
issued 
well-documented instructions 
on 
recording obligations 
to 
the 
Bank. 
The 
Bank 
and 
the 
Borrower 
agreed 
upon an 
acceptable 
mechanism 
for 
disbursing 
and 
monitoring 
IDA 
funds 
under 
the 
recent  Serbia  SAC,  and 
similar 
arrangements 
were 
confirmed 
at 
the recent negotiations 
for 
SOSAC. 
In 
the 
interim, 
the 
name 
of 
the 
NBY 
has 
been 
changed 
to 
the 
National Bank 
of 
Serbia, 
but 
the 
institution 
and 
its 
current capacity 
remain 
the 
same. 
On 
public 
financial 
accountability, 
there 
were 
a range 
of 
shortcomings 
identified 
by 
the 
CFAA 
which 
are 
not 
uncommon 
to 
countries 
in 
ECA, 
including: 
(a) 
weak budget 
planning 
and preparation, 
including 
need 
for 
greater comprehensiveness 
of 
budgeting, 
including for 
extra budgetary 
funds; 
(ii) 
weak 
management 
of 
budget 
execution, 
in 
particular 
lack 
of 
control 
of 
commitments  and 
inefficient 
cash management; 
(iii) 
weak 
financial 
controls, 
including 
lack 
of 
updated 
information 
on 
the 
financial position 
of 
line 
ministries, 
weak 
follow-up 
to 
ensure 
appropriate 
use 
of 
budgetary 
funds, 
and 
need 
to 
strengthen 
internal 
audit 
and 
introduce 
a 
system 
of 
external audit. 
78. 
The 
Serbian 
Government 
is 
moving 
aggressively 
to 
address 
the 
weakness 
identified, 
including 
through 
the 
new 
Law 
on 
Budget 
Systems, 
which 
anticipates a 
modern 
budget 
system. 
In 
particular, 
the 
authorities 
have established a Treasury 
within 
MOFE, 
and 
the 
new 
system 
is 
expected 
to 
be 
implemented 
by 
end 
2003, 
with 
an 
interim 
treasury/general 
ledger 
implemented 
by 
MOFE 
in 
late 
2002 
to 
improve 
cash 
management and 
commitment control. Implementation 
of 
the 
new 
Treasury 
and budget 
process 
reforms 
is 
being 
supported 
by 
a range 
of 
donors, 
including 
EU, 
USAID, 
DFID 
and 
the 
Bank. 
The 
Bank 
is 
working 
with 
the 
Government 
to 
follow 
up 
on 
issues 
identified 
in 
the 
CFAA.

approved and adopted a 
Supervisory 
Development 
Plan, 
established  a 
Supervisory 
Review 
Committee, and 
communicated the 
SDP 
to 
all 
supervisory staff. 
The 
Government 
has 
adopted a 
privatization 
strategy 
for 
stakes 
in 
banks 
acquired 
as 
a 
result 
of 
debt-to-equity 
conversion 
of 
PLC 
liabilities. 
The 
BRA/Government 
has 
implemented 
lending controls 
and governance  arrangements 
in 
all 
majority 
state-owned banks 
under 
the 
program, 
including 
the 
launching 
and 
implementation 
of 
diagnostic 
audits 
in 
eight 
banks 
with 
state 
majority 
ownership 
and one large non-state 
majority

to 
act 
on 
behalf 
of 
an enterprise  at 
all 
stages 
of 
the

Borrower’s 
commitment and ownership 
The 
SAM 
and Serbian governments are 
fully 
committed 
to 
the 
transformation 
of 
Serbia 
into 
a 
frill- 
- 
fledged 
market 
economy and 
to 
its 
integration 
into 
the European 
Union. 
Recognizing 
difficulties 
and 
risks 
involved, 
the authorities 
are 
determined 
to 
help 
Serbia’s 
enterprise and 
financial 
sectors 
adjust 
to 
the 
new 
market-economy 
environment 
by 
completing 
the  ownership 
transformation 
of 
inefficient 
and 
insolvent 
SOEs, 
establishing 
a 
more competitive 
and service oriented 
banking 
system 
that 
can 
mobilize 
a 
rising 
level 
of 
financial 
resources 
and 
provide 
for 
the 
credit 
needs 
of 
a 
growing 
economy, 
and 
developing 
a 
modern 
legislative 
and 
institutional 
framework 
for 
operations 
of 
enterprises 
and banks. 
The 
striking 
difference 
in 
profitability 
(and 
by 
implication, 
productivity) 
between 
private 
and 
non-private 
sectors 
provides 
a 
key 
rationale 
for 
the 
proposed 
reform 
strategy. 
83. 
The 
Government’s 
commitment 
to 
the 
development 
of 
vibrant private 
and 
financial 
sectors 
is 
reflected 
in 
major 
progress 
achieved over the 
past 
two 
years, 
largely 
supported 
through 
PFSAC 
I. 
The 
Government 
requested support 
through 
this 
operation 
during 
the 
TSSU 
discussions, 
and 
confirmed 
the 
need 
for 
support 
during 
the  recent 
CAS 
consultations 
held 
in 
Belgrade 
in 
February 
2003.  The 
Government and 
the 
Bank 
agreed 
on 
the 
broad 
agenda 
for 
the 
proposed 
operation 
in 
April 
2002, 
recorded 
in 
the 
medium-term 
sections 
of 
the 
LDP 
for 
PFSAC 
I. 
The 
authorities 
have since 
taken 
a 
number 
of 
resolute 
reform 
steps 
in 
pursuance 
of 
this 
agenda, 
as 
described 
in 
the 
Government’s 
LDP 
for 
this 
operation. 
D. 
Coordination 
with 
the 
IMF 
and 
Donors 
84. 
The 
proposed 
project 
has 
been 
developed 
in 
close 
collaboration 
with 
the 
IMF 
and 
other 
key 
international 
donors. 
The 
Government’s 
overall 
reform 
program 
has 
been 
designed 
within 
a 
framework 
for 
macroeconomic 
stability 
consistent 
with 
SAM’s 
Extended 
Arrangement approved 
by 
the 
IMF 
in 
May 
2002. 
The 
Fund 
has 
also 
provided 
technical 
assistance 
in 
some 
areas 
of 
financial 
sector 
reforms 
throughout 
various 
stages 
of 
the  proposed 
structural 
reform 
program, 
while 
the 
Bank input 
has 
been 
instrumental 
in 
developing 
the structural 
elements 
of 
the 
EA. 
27 
Page  33
85. 
Several 
bilateral 
and 
multilateral 
donors 
are 
providing 
important 
financial 
and  technical 
assistance 
in 
all 
four 
areas 
supported 
by 
the 
PFSAC 
11. 
They 
include 
the 
European  Commission, 
European 
Bank 
for 
Reconstruction 
and Development, 
UK 
DFID, 
USAID, 
US 
Treasury, 
Japan, 
Sweden, 
and 
the 
Netherlands. 
PFSAC 
I1 
is 
specifically 
designed 
to 
provide 
an 
umbrella 
framework 
for 
channeling 
the 
efforts 
of 
donors 
in 
business 
environment 
reform 
and enterprise 
privatization 
and 
restructuring. 
The 
Bank 
will 
continue 
to 
liaise closely 
with 
donors 
to 
ensure 
broad 
agreement 
in 
overall 
reform 
priorities 
and 
specific policies. 
In 
particular, 
the 
Bank 
would 
regularly 
inform 
the 
European 
Commission 
of 
progress 
in 
PFSAC 
I1 
implementation 
to 
ensure 
that 
the 
Government’s 
policies 
are 
consistent 
with 
SAM’s 
long-term 
aspirations 
to 
join 
the 
EU. 
E. 
Lessons 
Learned 
from 
Previous 
Bank 
Operations 
86. 
The project 
design incorporates the 
lessons 
from 
the 
implementation 
of 
PFSAC 
I, 
as 
well 
as 
from 
transition 
reforms 
in 
the 
ECA 
region 
during 
the 
past 
decade. 
Experience 
has 
shown 
that 
an 
integrated 
approach 
is 
needed 
to 
reform 
the 
private 
and 
financial 
sectors 
in 
Serbia. 
Under 
the 
proposed operation, 
financial 
sector 
reforms 
are 
expected 
to 
boost 
financial 
intermediation, 
and encourage 
domestic 
savings, 
generating the 
much 
needed 
working 
capital 
and investment 
finance 
needed 
for 
the 
real 
sector 
to 
expand. 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
the 
privatization 
of 
socially-owned 
enterprises 
and 
a 
more 
vibrant small 
and 
medium 
enterprise 
sector 
supported 
by 
the 
reforms 
of 
business-enabling environment,  are expected 
to 
lay 
the 
basis 
for 
sustainable 
growth. 
Very 
importantly, 
the 
proposed 
project 
will 
be 
sequenced 
with 
the 
Government’s 
ongoing 
efforts, 
supported 
by 
the 
Bank 
and 
other 
donors, 
to 
provide 
adequate 
social 
protection 
for 
those 
displaced 
by 
restructuring 
and 
privatization. 
87. 
Another 
key 
lesson 
from 
transition 
experiences 
elsewhere 
is 
the 
need 
for 
careful 
sequencing 
of 
the 
more 
immediate structural 
reforms 
in 
enterprise and 
financial 
sector 
with 
the 
long-term 
efforts 
aimed 
at 
creating 
an 
adequate 
regulatory 
and 
institutional 
framework 
for 
sustainable 
economic 
growth. 
As 
noted 
above, 
the 
authorities, 
with 
the 
Bank’s 
support 
through 
PFSAC 
I, 
have 
moved 
swiftly 
on 
the 
pressing 
transition 
reforms, 
including privatization 
of 
socially-owned 
enterprises 
and 
liquidation 
of 
insolvent 
banks. 
It 
is 
critical 
to 
the 
sustainability 
of 
the 
overall 
reform 
program 
that 
the 
Government 
now 
devotes 
equal 
attention 
to 
regulatory 
and 
institutional 
reforms. 
Accordingly, 
the 
PFSAC 
I1 
would 
focus 
strongly 
on 
the 
regulatory 
and 
institutional 
reform 
agenda 
to 
create adequate 
enabling environment 
for 
enterprise 
and 
financial 
sectors, 
while 
seeking 
to 
ensure 
that 
the 
structural 
reform 
agenda 
retains equal 
priority. 
F. 
Benefits 
and 
Risks 
88. 
Benefits. 
The 
main 
benefit 
of 
the 
proposed 
credit 
would 
be 
faster 
private 
sector 
growth 
and 
job 
creation, supported 
by 
a healthier and 
more 
developed 
financial 
system. 
Overall 
enterprise 
and 
financial 
sector 
performance 
is 
expected 
to 
improve. 
This 
improvement 
may 
come 
partly 
through 
the 
sale 
of 
enterprises 
and 
banks 
to 
local 
and 
foreign 
investors 
with 
strong 
management capacity, and 
partly 
through 
improved 
financial discipline 
as 
a 
result 
of 
more 
proactive restructuring. 
Additionally,  formation 
of 
new 
private 
sector 
firms 
is 
expected 
to 
accelerate 
in 
response 
to 
an 
improved 
business 
enabling environment 
and 
an increased 
supply 
of 
productive 
assets 
expected 
to 
be 
released 
from 
loss 
making 
firms 
as 
part 
of 
enterprise 
restructuring 
efforts. 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
a 
well-functioning, 
properly 
regulated and 
transparent 
financial 
system 
would 
allow 
an 
adequate 
mobilization 
of 
resources and 
better 
allocation 
into 
productive 
investments 
needed 
by 
the 
private 
sector 
to 
modernize and 
expand 
their 
businesses. 
89. 
Very 
importantly, 
privatization 
and, 
in 
some 
cases, 
liquidation 
of 
some 
of 
the 
largest 
loss-making 
SOEs, 
as 
well 
as 
majority 
state-owned banks 
will 
reinforce 
sustainability 
of 
Serbia’s 
macroeconomic 
stabilization 
and 
fiscal discipline 
by 
removing 
a long-standing 
source 
of 
budget 
drain. 
Finally, 
the 
Bank’s 
support 
of 
the 
Government’s 
reform 
efforts 
will 
send 
a 
positive 
signal, 
both 
to 
other donors 
wishing 
to 
provide 
budgetary 
support 
and 
to 
potential private 
investors and creditors.

90. 
Risks. 
The 
proposed 
operation 
faces 
three 
sets 
of 
risks. 
First, 
general 
political 
uncertainty 
related 
to 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
new 
constitutional 
arrangements 
in 
the 
union 
of 
Serbia and 
Montenegro 
and 
its 
constituent  member 
states. 
This 
is 
compounded 
by 
the 
recent  assassination 
of 
the 
Serbian 
Prime 
Minister, 
and 
the  failure 
of 
two 
rounds 
of 
the 
Serbian 
presidential  elections 
in 
late 
2002 
owing 
to 
insufficient 
voter turnout. 
Second, 
consequently, 
the 
operation 
also 
faces 
a 
potential 
risk 
of 
weakening 
of 
political 
commitment 
to 
restructure, 
privatize 
and/or 
liquidate 
large loss 
making 
enterprises and 
majority 
state-owned banks, 
many 
of 
which 
are 
politically/socially 
sensitive 
because 
of 
their 
importance 
to 
the 
economy 
as 
a 
whole 
and the 
potential 
social 
and 
fiscal 
costs. 
Finally, 
the 
worsening 
of 
global 
economic 
climate 
would 
pose 
a 
significant 
risk 
that 
could 
deter 
the 
potential private 
capital 
inflows to 
Serbia, 
affecting 
the 
success 
of 
enterprise and bank 
privatization. 
G. 
Poverty Implications/Social 
Impact 
91. 
The 
Government’s  structural 
reform 
program 
supported 
by 
PFSAC 
I1 
will 
have an 
important 
impact 
on 
poverty, 
both 
in 
the 
short  and 
medium 
term. 
In 
the  short  term, 
some 
reforms, 
such 
as 
privatization 
and, 
particularly, 
restructuring 
of 
large 
SOEs, 
could 
have 
significant 
social 
costs 
as 
redundant 
labor 
would 
be released.20 
The 
Serbian 
Government 
has 
demonstrated 
a 
clear 
concern 
for 
and 
interest 
in 
mitigating 
any 
negative social 
impact 
of 
reforms. 
In 
2002, 
the  Government 
has 
adopted 
a 
Social Program 
to 
deal 
with 
the social 
consequences 
of 
privatization 
restructuring 
(see 
more 
details 
in 
section 
N.B 
above). 
The 
Bank 
is 
committed 
to working 
closely 
with 
the 
Government 
to 
ensure 
that any 
social 
issues 
arising 
from 
the 
operation 
are 
properly 
addressed 
in 
the 
context 
of 
the 
recently 
approved 
SOSAC and 
Labor 
LIC. 
92. 
In 
the 
longer 
term, 
PFSAC 
I1 
is 
expected 
to 
have an 
overall 
positive impact 
on 
poverty 
in 
Serbia. 
It 
is 
expected 
that 
crowding out 
of 
the 
private 
sector 
by 
large 
loss 
making 
firms 
will 
cease, 
enterprise 
sector 
performance 
will 
significantly 
improve, 
and 
the 
Serbian economy 
will 
embark 
on 
a 
steady 
growth 
path. 
The 
formation 
of 
new 
private 
sector 
firms 
and 
formalization 
of 
the 
vibrant 
informal 
economy 
are 
expected 
to 
accelerate 
in 
response 
to 
an increased 
supply 
of 
productive 
assets 
that 
will 
be 
released 
from 
loss 
making 
firms 
as 
part 
of 
a restructuring 
effort. 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
the 
business 
environment reforms 
supported 
by 
this 
operation 
will 
result 
in 
creation 
of 
new 
jobs, 
which would 
absorb 
some 
of 
the 
displaced 
labor. 
Such 
a 
reconfiguration 
and 
the 
spin-off 
and 
outsourcing 
of 
functions 
are 
important 
for 
the 
development 
of 
the 
formal 
SME 
sector. 
Consistent 
with 
the 
Bank’s 
latest 
thinking 
on 
poverty 
reduction, 
the 
establishment 
of 
transparent 
competition 
regime 
in 
which 
new 
firms 
can 
enter 
the 
market, substandard 
firms 
are 
allowed 
to 
fail, 
and 
good 
firms 
face 
few 
barriers 
to 
growth, 
represents 
an 
essential 
precondition 
for 
development 
of 
dynamic 
Serbian 
economy 
capable 
of 
creating wealth 
and 
alleviating poverty. 
H. 
Environmental 
Impact 
93. 
The 
proposed 
PFSAC 
I1 
is 
not 
expected 
to 
result 
in 
any 
direct 
negative 
impact 
on 
the 
environment. 
For 
the 
purposes 
of 
Operational 
Directive 
4.01, 
the 
ECSSD 
review 
rated 
the 
Credit 
as 
Category 
C, 
which 
does 
not 
require 
an 
environmental 
assessment. 
94. 
The 
indirect 
environmental implications 
of 
the 
Government’s 
reform 
program 
supported 
under 
PFSAC 
I1 
are 
expected 
to 
be 
limited 
and 
primarily 
relate 
to 
the 
restructuring 
of 
some 
of 
the 
large 
SOEs. 
The 
Government,  however, 
has 
already 
taken 
important 
measures 
to 
ensure  adequate 
environmental 
safeguards 
based 
on 
recommendations 
of 
the 
Bank. 
All 
major 
enterprises 
undergoing 
privatization 
*’ 
In 
practice, 
the 
social 
disruption 
associated 
with 
labor 
redeployment 
may 
be 
overstated. 
Many 
of 
the 
workers 
in 
large 
SOEs 
are 
on 
administrative 
leave 
and 
working 
in 
the 
informal 
sector. 
These 
workers 
only 
receive 
minimal 
wages 
and 
benefits 
from 
their 
“official” 
jobs. 
29 
Page  35
through 
tender 
are 
being 
subject 
to 
environmental 
assessments. The 
results 
of 
the 
assessments 
are 
included 
in 
the 
Information 
Memorandum, 
which 
stipulates the  commitments 
that 
the 
investor/buyer 
needs 
to 
undertake 
regarding possible environmental 
liabilities. 
In 
February 
2003, 
the 
MOEP 
submitted 
an 
amendment, 
which 
was 
adopted 
by  Parliament,  to 
the 
Privatization 
Law 
which 
stipulates 
the 
assumption 
by 
the 
state 
of 
liabilities 
for 
past 
environmental 
damages. 
The 
methodology 
for 
determining 
the extent 
of 
these 
liabilities, 
as 
well 
as 
mechanisms 
for 
addressing 
them, 
will 
be 
described 
in 
a 
series 
of 
by-laws, 
to 
be 
developed 
jointly 
by 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Environment 
and 
MOEP 
and 
the 
PA, 
with 
the 
Bank’s 
technical 
assistance. 
95. 
In 
the 
medium 
term, 
the 
Government, 
assisted 
by 
the 
Bank 
and 
other 
donors, 
is 
expected 
to 
address 
the 
issues 
of 
environmental compliance 
and 
industrial 
pollution 
in 
the 
enterprise 
sector, 
and 
implement 
a 
reform 
agenda 
that 
would 
encompass 
improvement 
of 
the 
environment-related 
legislative 
framework, 
regulatory 
and 
institutional 
capacity, 
and 
mitigate 
the 
negative  impact 
of 
the 
previous 
environmental 
policies 
and 
practices 
in 
the 
enterprise sector.

Second 
Private 
and Financial 
Sector 
Adjustment 
Credit 
to 
Serbia 
and

April

Mr. 
James 
Wolfensohn 
President 
The 
World 
Bank 
1818 
H 
Street 
N.W. 
Washington 
D.C., 
20433 
Dear 
Mr. 
Wolfensohn, 
I. 
Introduction 
It 
has 
been 
nearly 
one 
year since 
we 
wrote 
to 
you 
in 
reference 
to 
the 
first 
stage 
of 
sectoral 
reforms 
in 
private 
and 
financial 
sector 
development, 
which 
were 
successfully supported 
by 
the 
World 
Bank's 
first 
Private and 
Financial 
Sector 
Adjustment 
Credit 
(PFSAC). 
This 
Letter 
of 
Sectoral 
Development 
Policy 
presents 
the 
current 
status 
of 
such 
reforms, 
and 
it 
outlines the 
continuation 
of 
this 
agenda 
in 
Serbia 
and 
Montenegro 
(SAM) 
and 
its 
largest 
member 
state, Serbia. 
It 
also 
requests 
support 
from 
the 
World 
Bank 
for 
a 
second 
PFSAC. 
From 
the 
onset, 
we 
want to 
stress 
that 
the 
SAM 
and 
Serbian governments 
remain 
firmly 
committed 
to 
the 
principles 
and 
objectives 
of 
the 
PFSAC 
program. 
In 
this 
regard, 
we 
remain 
consistent 
with 
our 
view 
that 
reforms 
in 
the enterprise and 
financial 
sectors  are 
not only 
important to 
cementing 
our overall goal 
of 
rapid 
transition 
to 
a 
well-functioning 
market 
economy, 
but 
are 
also 
central 
to 
achieving 
growth 
and 
economic 
development.  Consequently, 
we 
consider 
that 
the 
implementation 
of 
regulatory,  institutional, 
and structural 
reforms policies 
supported 
by 
the 
second 
PFSAC 
are 
essential 
to 
significantly 
accelerate 
private 
sector-led 
growth 
through: 
(i) 
improving 
the 
business 
environment 
by 
means 
of 
comprehensive 
reform 
of 
enterprise 
entry, 
operation and exit; 
(ii) 
strengthening 
the 
financial 
system 
by 
privatizing 
andor 
liquidating majority 
state-owned banks 
and 
improving 
the  environment 
under 
which 
banks 
and 
other 
financial 
intermediaries 
operate; 
and 
(iii) 
privatizing 
and restructuring 
socially-owned 
enterprises 
that 
crowd 
out private 
sector 
growth, 
hamper 
banking 
sector 
recovery, and 
incur 
significant fiscal and 
quasi- 
fiscal 
costs. 
Our 
enterprise 
and 
financial 
sector 
reform 
program 
is 
also embedded 
in 
the macroeconomic 
framework 
supported 
by 
a three 
year 
IMF 
Extended 
Arrangement 
which 
was 
approved 
by 
the 
IMF 
Board 
in 
May 
2002. 
As 
you 
are aware, 
the Parliaments 
of 
the 
member 
states 
of 
the 
union 
of 
Serbia 
and 
Montenegro 
have 
recently 
approved 
a 
new 
Constitutional 
Charter, 
which 
provides 
the 
legal 
framework for 
new 
relations 
at 
the 
union 
level. 
The 
Charter 
has 
also 
effectively 
transferred 
a 
number 
of 
responsibilities 
to 
the 
member 
states, 
including 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
private 
and 
financial 
sectors 
reform 
program 
supported 
by 
the 
second 
PFSAC. 
Therefore, 
as 
far 
as 
the 
reform 
program 
that 
is 
presented 
in 
this 
letter, 
and 
consistent 
with 
Page  42
what 
we 
have 
expressed 
to 
you 
before, 
it 
should 
be 
understood 
that 
all 
policies and 
objectives 
that 
are 
hereby 
presented 
refer 
to 
the 
reform 
program 
of 
the 
Government 
of 
Serbia. 
11. 
Recent Economic 
Developments 
SAM 
and 
Serbia 
began 
the 
delayed 
transition to 
democracy 
and 
a 
market economy under 
very difficult 
economic and social 
conditions. 
These 
conditions result 
from 
nearly 
four 
decades 
of 
inefficient 
economic 
management 
and 
a 
decade 
of 
regional conflicts 
and international 
isolation 
that 
followed 
the break-up 
of 
socialist 
Yugoslavia 
in 
1991. 
By 
2000, 
recorded per 
capita 
GDP 
had 
fallen 
to 
about one 
half 
of 
its 
1989 
level, 
total public 
debt  exceeded 
140 
percent 
of 
GDP 
and 
440 
percent 
of 
exports, 
and 
inflation 
had 
surpassed 
1 
13 
percent. 
Despite 
these 
formidable 
odds, 
over 
the  past 
two 
years, 
our 
governments 
have taken 
major 
steps 
to 
address 
the  daunting  legacy 
of 
the 
past. 
We 
have 
followed 
a 
two-pronged 
approach 
combining 
stabilization 
measures 
with 
decisive 
steps 
in 
an 
agenda 
of 
structural 
reforms  aimed 
at 
initiating 
the 
delayed 
transition. 
We 
began 
efforts 
toward 
stabilizing 
and 
reforming 
the 
economy 
in 
late-2000 
by 
tightening 
macroeconomic  policies. 
These 
were 
initially 
supported 
by 
an 
IMF 
program 
approved 
in 
December 
2000, 
and 
then 
by 
a 
Stand 
By 
Agreement 
of 
US$249 
million 
equivalent  approved 
in 
June 
2001. 
Subsequently, 
a  three-year 
Extended  Arrangement 
(EA) 
of 
US$829 
million 
equivalent 
was 
approved 
in 
May 
2002, 
spanning  the 
period 
through  end-March 
2005. 
Such 
an 
arrangement  was 
a 
prerequisite 
for 
implementing 
the 
significant 
debt 
reduction 
which 
we 
negotiated 
with 
the Paris 
Club 
in 
November 
2001, 
which 
cuts 
our 
debt 
substantially 
in 
line 
with 
adequate 
performance 
under the 
EA. 
In 
parallel to 
stabilization 
efforts, 
our 
governments 
took 
the 
first 
steps 
in 
an 
agenda 
of 
structural 
reforms 
aimed 
at 
initiating 
the delayed 
transition. 
In 
addition to 
resolute enterprise 
and 
banking 
sector measures 
supported 
under 
the 
first PFSAC, 
described 
below 
in 
this 
letter, 
significant 
steps 
have 
been taken 
in 
key 
reform 
areas 
supported 
by 
the 
World 
Bank 
through 
the 
first 
Structural 
Adjustment 
Credit 
(SAC) 
and 
the 
Social 
Sector 
Adjustment Credit 
(SOSAC). 
Strong 
implementation 
of 
these 
reforms 
despite 
the 
remaining 
political 
uncertainties 
has 
brought 
initial 
macroeconomic  stability, 
while  laying 
the 
foundations 
for 
a 
sustained 
recovery  and 
improved 
living 
standards. 
The twelve-month 
inflation 
rate 
declined 
from 
113.5 
percent 
at 
end-2000 
to 
39 
percent 
at 
end 
2001, 
and further 
to 
14.2 
percent 
at 
end-2002. 
The 
nominal Dinar 
exchange 
rate 
to 
DM/Euro 
has 
been 
maintained 
at 
a 
relatively 
stable 
level 
in 
Serbia since 
late 
2000. 
The 
National 
Bank 
of 
Serbia 
(NBS) 
official foreign 
reserves 
continue 
to 
grow, reaching almost 
US$2.3 
billion 
in 
February 
2003. 
Real 
GDP 
growth 
rebounded 
from 
the 
highly 
negative 
rates 
of 
1999 
to positive 
rates 
of 
about 5-6 
percent 
in 
2000 
and 2001. 
Preliminary 
results 
for 
2002 show 
that 
a 
growth 
rate 
of 
4 
percent 
has 
been 
reached. 
This 
growth 
rate 
had 
been supported 
by 
higher 
public 
investment 
and 
greater 
levels 
of 
external budget 
support. 
Industrial production 
has 
been 
stagnant 
in 
2001, 
reflecting 
capacity 
constraints 
after 
years 
of 
isolation 
and 
the 
ongoing 
economic restructuring. Recorded 
growth 
of 
industrial output 
for 
2002 
is 
1.7 
percent, 
with 
the 
total industrial output 
at 
the 
end 
of 
2002 
at 
only 
half 
of 
1991 output. 
Unemployment 
still 
remains 
very 
high, 
with 
the 
official 
recorded 
rate 
reaching 
30 
percent 
in 
the 
first 
half 
of 
2002. 
With 
regard 
to 
foreign  trade, 
following 
a 
18.6 
percent 
increase 
(in 
US 
dollar 
terms) 
in 
2000, 
exports 
rose 
by 
a 
further 
7.7 
percent 
in 
2001 and 
a 
further 
18.2 
percent 
in 
2002. 
Import growth 
has 
also 
remained 
high 
compared 
to 
2001, 
when 
the 
combination 
of 
rising 
donor 
support 
and restored 
trade contacts 
led 
to 
a 
growth 
of 
28.9 
percent. 
Total 
imports 
in 
2002 
were 
32.9 
percent 
higher 
than 
in 
2001, 
reaching 
US$6.3 
billion. 
Since exports 
are 
so 
much 
smaller 
than 
imports, 
the 
trade 
balance 
deficit 
is 
also increasing, 
and 
reached 
US$4 
billion 
at 
the 
end 
of 
2002. 
The 
current 
account 
dejkit 
is 
projected 
for 
2002 
at 
around 
8.9 
percent 
of 
GDP. 
2 
Page  43
The 
fiscal 
deficit 
(before 
official 
grants) 
increased 
from 
1 
percent 
of 
GDP 
in 
2000 
to 
an 
estimated 
5 
percent 
in 
2002, 
equivalent 
to  US$600 
million. 
This 
is 
due 
to 
the 
more 
realistic 
budgeting 
of 
commitments 
(i.e., 
lower 
accumulation 
of 
arrears), 
as 
well 
as 
recent 
increase 
in 
debt service payments. 
The 
deficit 
increase 
has 
been managed 
in 
a 
manner 
consistent 
with 
ongoing 
stabilization 
efforts 
due 
to 
the 
strong 
inflow 
of 
donor 
funding 
since 
2000. 
Significant 
portion 
of 
the 
deficit 
was 
financed 
by 
revenues 
from 
privatization, 
which 
amounted 
to 
approximately 
US$220 
million 
in 
2002. 
To 
achieve 
the macroeconomic 
objectives 
for 
2003-2005 
and support 
implementation 
of 
further structural 
reforms, 
our 
governments 
will 
require 
substantial 
capitd 
inflows. 
Even following 
the 
restructuring 
of 
Paris 
Club 
debt 
and 
a sharp increase 
in 
dollar 
GDP 
in 
2001 
and 
2002, 
our external 
debt 
remained 
a 
very 
high 
75 percent 
of 
GDP 
at 
end-2002. 
Between 
2003 
and 
2005,  gross 
external 
financing 
requirements 
(excluding 
for 
debt 
rescheduling) 
are 
estimated at about 
US$7.9 
billion. 
These resources 
are 
needed 
to 
finance  US$4.7 
billion 
of 
current 
account 
deficits 
(excluding 
interest 
and 
official 
transfers), 
US$l.l 
billion 
in 
increased 
international 
reserves, 
and 
the remainder 
of 
US$2.1 
billion 
to 
fulfill 
net debt 
service 
obligations. 
During 
this 
period, 
as 
the 
fiscal 
deficit 
is 
increasingly 
brought under 
control, 
we 
expect that 
these 
needs 
will 
shift 
from 
the budgetary 
sector 
to 
the 
private 
sector. 
We 
expect 
our 
financing 
needs 
to 
be 
met 
from 
several 
sources. 
With 
good 
progress 
on 
reforms, 
foreign 
direct 
investment and 
other 
private 
sector 
finance 
should 
grow 
to total 
around US$4.3 
billion 
during 
this 
three 
year period. 
The remaining 
US$3.6 
billion 
of 
financing 
during 
this 
period 
is 
expected 
come 
from 
official 
bilateral and multilateral 
sources. 
We 
hope 
that 
the 
World 
Bank 
program 
generally, 
and 
the 
proposed 
adjustment 
operation 
more 
specifically, 
would 
represent 
a 
significant 
share 
of 
this 
financing, 
and 
can 
thus 
play 
a 
crucial 
role 
in 
helping to 
ensure 
adequate 
financing 
for 
the 
reform 
programs 
in 
Serbia. 
111. 
Program 
of 
Regulatory and 
Institutional 
Reforms 
A. 
Business 
Environment 
Reform 
Context. 
Our 
the 
initial reform 
efforts,  supported 
by 
the 
World 
Bank 
under the 
PFSAC 
I, 
focused 
on 
launching 
pressing 
transition 
reforms, 
including 
privatization 
of 
socially-owned 
enterprises. 
At 
this 
stage, 
we 
consider 
improvements 
in 
the 
business 
environment 
as 
key 
and 
highly 
complementary 
to 
the current 
program. 
The 
sustainable 
growth 
of 
the Serbian 
economy 
requires 
a business 
environment 
conducive to 
the development 
of 
the 
private 
sector. 
Serbia’s 
private 
entrepreneurial energy 
is 
among 
its 
greatest 
assets 
for 
economic 
recovery 
and 
has 
already 
contributed 
significantly 
to 
growth. 
With 
assistance 
from 
the 
World 
Bank 
and 
other donors 
over 
the 
past 
two 
years, 
we 
have 
made 
progress 
toward 
business 
enabling 
reforms, 
including 
liberalization 
and  deregulation 
of 
foreign 
trade 
and 
investment, 
simplification 
of 
the tax regime, 
and modernization 
of 
the 
labor 
legislation. 
However, 
recent 
surveys 
indicate 
that 
Serbia’s 
administrative 
and regulatory environment 
continues 
to 
be 
hostile 
to 
private 
business 
start-up 
and 
expansion, 
as 
witnessed 
by 
the 
lingering 
presence 
of 
a 
large 
informal 
sector. 
For 
instance, 
according 
to 
the 
World 
Bank’s 
Doing 
Business survey, 
it 
takes 
16 
procedures, 
71 
days 
and 
US$202 
(app. 
20 
percent 
of 
2000 
GNI 
per 
capita) 
that 
a 
start-up 
must 
bear 
before 
it 
can operate 
legally. 
Many 
problems 
in 
Serbia’s 
business 
environment 
are 
of 
transitional 
nature, 
but 
others 
are 
structural, 
and 
will 
be 
resolved 
only 
with 
continued, 
more 
coordinated, 
and 
more 
comprehensive reforms. 
Priority 
reforms: 
Our 
Government 
has 
put 
in 
motion, 
in 
coordination 
with 
the 
World 
Bank, the 
IMF, 
and 
other 
donors, 
a 
key 
set 
of 
reforms 
which 
aim 
to: 
(i) 
remove 
administrative  and legislative  barriers 
to 
entry; 
(ii) 
facilitate 
efficient 
operations 
of 
business 
through 
reforming 
the 
Enterprise 
Law 
and 
the 
Law 
on 
3 
Page  44
Concessions, 
building 
institutional 
capacity 
for 
deregulation 
and 
improving 
enterprises’ 
access 
to 
finance; 
and 
(iii) 
reduce 
barriers 
to 
the 
efficient 
exit 
and redeployment 
of 
non-productive 
assets. 
We 
have 
launched 
a 
comprehensive 
reform 
of 
business 
registration 
at 
the end 
of 
2002 
and 
plan 
to 
complete 
the 
reform 
by 
the 
end 
of 
2003. 
Our 
objective 
is 
to 
reduce the 
number 
of 
days needed 
to 
register 
an 
enterprise 
from 
the 
current 
71 
to 
15-20. 
The 
structure 
for 
a 
proposed 
new 
registration 
system 
converges 
with 
best 
European 
practices 
and 
aims 
to: 
(i) 
create a 
unified 
Serbian 
business 
register 
that 
includes 
all 
business 
activities; 
(ii) 
administer 
the 
new  unified 
registry 
through 
an 
independent 
administrative 
agency; 
(iii) 
allow 
businesses 
to 
start 
activities 
immediately  after 
registration; 
(iv) 
streamline data requirements 
for 
each 
class 
of 
business 
according 
to 
European 
Union 
(EU) 
benchmarks; 
(v) 
expand electronic registration and 
updating, 
and 
ensure 
easy 
electronic 
accessibility 
to 
the 
database; 
and, 
(vi) 
create a 
single 
unique 
identifying 
number 
for 
each 
enterprise that 
would 
serve 
all 
government 
needs. 
The 
system 
will 
be 
administered 
by 
an 
independent 
expert 
agency that 
is 
committed 
to 
supporting 
the 
needs 
of 
businesses 
and 
is 
accountable 
to 
the Government 
for 
delivering 
information 
of 
a 
timeliness 
and 
quality 
to 
serve 
public 
needs 
such 
as 
inspections. 
In 
addition, 
we 
are 
working 
on 
a 
new 
construction 
law, 
which 
will 
facilitate the 
issue 
of 
construction 
permits 
helping 
remove 
an 
important 
barrier 
to 
entry. 
We 
are 
committed 
to 
adopting 
a 
new, 
modernized version 
of 
the 
Enterprise 
Law 
which 
occupies 
a 
central 
position 
in 
the system 
of 
commercial law. 
With 
the 
privatization 
process 
rapidly 
accelerating 
and foreign 
investment 
returning 
to 
Serbia, 
good 
corporate governance becomes 
absolutely 
essential 
for 
successful 
transition. 
The 
new 
Enterprise 
Law 
will 
be 
drafted 
so 
that 
it 
is 
consistent 
with 
EU 
practices 
on 
corporate 
governance, 
including 
the 
duties 
and  responsibilities 
of 
directors 
and 
managers, 
guidelines 
for 
shareholders’ 
meetings and voting, 
etc. 
The 
new 
law 
will 
also 
provide 
for more 
flexible 
and effective 
legal forms 
for 
enterprises, 
making 
it 
easier 
for 
small 
entrepreneurs 
to 
incorporate. 
The 
objective 
will 
be 
to 
create a 
single 
law 
governing 
all 
enterprises 
using 
a 
corporate 
form. 
In 
response 
to 
foreign 
investors’ 
concerns 
over 
legal 
inconsistencies 
in 
the  current 
regime 
for 
concessions, 
we 
have 
drafted, 
with 
the 
support 
of 
the donor 
community, 
a 
new 
Law 
on 
Concessions. 
The 
purpose 
of 
this 
law 
is 
to promote and 
regulate investment 
in 
public 
infrastructure. 
The 
draft 
law 
replaces 
auctioning 
with 
a 
more 
transparent  tendering, 
as 
the 
mechanism 
for 
awarding 
concessions. 
It 
will 
ensure 
equal and 
fair 
treatment 
of 
investors 
and 
competitive and 
transparent concession 
granting. 
In 
recent months, 
we 
have 
also 
given 
significant 
attention 
to 
building 
the 
institutional 
capacity 
within 
the 
Government 
which would 
allow 
to 
manage 
reforms 
across 
various 
ministries.  Specifically,  the 
Ministry 
of 
Economy 
and 
Privatization (MOEP) 
proposed 
to 
the 
Government 
that the 
Inter-Ministerial 
Working 
Group 
on 
Deregulation, 
established 
in 
late 
2001, 
is 
transformed 
into 
a 
Council 
on 
Regulatory Reform, 
which 
will 
become 
a 
permanent 
advisory 
body 
to 
the 
Government 
on 
laws 
and  policies 
affecting 
businesses 
by 
receiving 
the 
authority to 
review 
all 
draft 
laws 
and 
government 
decrees 
prior to 
adoption. 
This 
very important 
change 
aims 
to 
prevent 
the 
proliferation 
of 
laws 
and 
regulations that keep 
imposing 
barriers 
to 
business 
entry 
and 
operations. 
We 
have 
also 
initiated 
the 
secured 
Jinancing 
system 
reform, 
with 
the 
objective 
to 
create  a 
modern, 
enabling, 
legal framework 
and 
appropriate 
implementing 
institutions 
that 
will 
support 
credit 
transactions 
which 
involve 
movable property 
as 
collateral. 
It 
will 
provide 
the 
legal 
structure 
within 
which 
modern 
secured 
financing 
of 
inventory, 
equipment, 
accounts 
and 
consumer 
goods 
can 
develop, 
and 
will 
improve 
the cost 
of 
credit 
and the 
efficiency 
of 
the 
market 
for 
secured 
transactions. 
Our 
reform 
program 
includes: 
(i) 
adopting 
the 
Law 
on 
Secured Transactions, 
and 
the regulations 
of 
the 
Collateral 
Registry, 
and 
ensuring 
consistency 
with 
other 
relevant 
commercial 
laws 
and 
regulations; 
(ii) 
establishing centralized 
collateral 
registry 
operating 
as 
public information 
provider;  and 
(iii) 
improving 
understanding 
of 
the 
new 
legal 
provisions 
and 
their 
practical 
use.

To 
promote the 
development 
of 
leasing 
operations 
in 
Serbia, 
the 
Ministry 
of 
International Economic 
Relations,  supported 
by 
the 
Southeast 
Europe 
Enterprise 
Development,  conducted 
a 
review 
of 
existing 
laws 
and regulations.  Based 
on 
the 
results 
of 
the  review, 
our 
Government 
has 
prepared 
a 
new 
draft 
Leasing 
Law 
which 
had 
been discussed 
with 
major 
stakeholders 
in 
the 
business 
community. 
Finally, our Government 
is 
committed 
to 
the creation 
of 
a 
functioning 
bankruptcy 
regime 
in 
Serbia. 
The 
MOEP 
has 
led 
the 
preparation 
of 
a 
draft 
new 
Bankruptcy Law, 
with 
the 
assistance 
of 
foreign 
and 
local 
experts 
with 
considerable 
input 
from 
the 
World 
Bank. The 
provisions 
of 
the 
new 
law 
are 
consistent 
with 
EU 
practices 
and 
have been 
designed 
to minimize 
the 
impact 
of 
existing institutional 
deficiencies 
in 
the 
judiciary 
and 
the 
trustee 
community. 
First, 
a 
Supervisory 
Body 
will 
be 
established 
to 
license,  supervise, 
and  regulate 
bankruptcy 
administrators 
(trustees). 
Second, 
in 
view 
of 
the 
experience 
of 
other  post- 
socialist 
economies 
where 
bankruptcy 
cases 
were 
fraught 
with 
collusion 
among 
bankruptcy 
administrators, 
judges 
and 
creditors, 
a 
creation 
of 
a 
specialized 
Bankruptcy Administration Agency 
has 
been 
envisaged. 
This 
Agency, 
associated 
with 
the 
MOEP, 
would 
be 
the 
only 
party 
which 
could be 
appointed 
as 
the 
trustee 
of 
a 
socially- 
or 
state-owned 
enterprise. 
The 
MOEP 
has 
begun to 
develop 
a 
general 
trustee 
training 
course 
and 
a 
program 
to 
educate 
the 
judges 
on 
the concepts 
contained 
in 
the 
new 
draft.

Medium-term 
reform 
objectives. 
As 
mentioned 
above, 
Serbia 
needs a 
more efficient 
and 
market-friendly 
business 
environment 
if 
privatization, market 
reforms, 
and 
trade 
and investment liberalization 
are 
to 
support 
sustainable 
growth 
of 
a 
competitive 
market 
economy. Therefore, 
sustainability 
and 
continuation 
of 
the current 
reform program 
will 
be 
ensured. 
The four 
main 
objectives 
of 
our 
medium-term program 
in 
the 
area 
of 
business 
environment 
are 
as 
follows: 
i. 
ensuring 
proper 
implementation and 
operation 
of 
the 
modem 
bankruptcy 
regime, 
which 
is 
needed 
not 
only 
to 
create 
financial discipline 
and 
allow exit 
of 
unviable 
enterprises 
but 
to 
allow 
the 
privatization 
and restructuring 
of 
the 
potentially viable 
ones; 
5 
Page  46
ii. 
developing 
proper 
corporate governance 
institutions that 
would 
support the 
future development 
of 
capital 
markets; 
111. 
developing 
anti-monopoly 
legislation and institutional 
capacity 
for 
enforcing 
it, 
which 
is 
crucial 
if 
Serbia 
is 
to 
build 
the 
foundations 
for 
its 
plans 
to 
join 
the 
EU; 
and, 
iv. 
laying 
the 
foundations 
for 
the 
development 
of 
a 
knowledge-based 
economy, 
to 
ensure 
that Serbia 
can 
be 
competitive 
in 
the 
global 
economy, 
by 
strengthening 
the 
intellectual property 
rights, 
increasing  competition 
in 
the  telecommunication 
sector, 
and  improvements 
in 
the 
R&D 
infrastructure. 
... 
B. 
Financial 
Sector 
Regulatory 
and 
Supervisory 
Framework 
Context. 
Building 
on 
the progress 
in 
bank 
supervision 
and regulation 
discussed 
in 
our 
LDP 
of 
April 
2002, 
we 
will 
further 
strengthen the 
regulatory  and supervisory 
mechanisms 
for 
the 
financial 
sector. 
In 
the 
banking 
sector, 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
2002 
the 
National 
Bank 
of 
Serbia 
(NBS) 
adopted 
a 
Supervisory 
Development 
Plan 
(SDP) 
as 
an 
official 
statement 
for 
the 
future 
direction 
of 
supervision. 
This 
document 
maps 
out 
the 
organizational and 
process 
changes 
needed 
to 
establish 
and 
implement 
a 
new 
supervisory 
approach 
based 
both 
on 
risk 
analysis 
and 
compliance 
verification. 
Work 
on 
implementing 
the 
development 
steps 
in 
the 
SDP began 
in 
earnest 
during 
the 
fourth 
quarter 
of 
2002. 
Several 
key 
benchmarks 
have already 
been 
achieved. 
A 
Supervisory 
Review 
Committee 
(SRC)  was established, 
composed 
of 
the 
senior managers 
of 
the department 
and 
the 
Vice-Governor,  that 
will 
oversee 
and 
monitor 
both 
supervisory 
activities 
and 
progress 
against 
the 
plan. 
A 
mission 
statement 
which 
formally 
presents 
the 
NBS’s 
supervisory  objectives 
was 
approved 
by 
the 
Committee and 
the 
NBS 
Governor 
and 
presented 
to 
the 
public. 
While 
further 
steps 
and 
progress 
has 
been 
made, 
we 
are 
conscious that 
the 
key 
to 
the 
future 
of 
the 
program 
remains 
linked 
to 
supervisory 
strategies 
for 
individual 
banks 
and 
NBS’s 
improved dialog 
with 
the 
banking 
community.  The 
banks’ 
supervisory 
strategies 
(and 
execution 
thereof) 
will 
ultimately 
represent, 
in 
large 
part, 
the 
culmination 
of 
the 
new 
risk 
based 
supervisory approach and 
the 
redirected 
supervisory methodology. 
In 
concert 
with 
the 
steps 
taken 
in 
the supervisory 
process 
arena, 
a 
number 
of 
enhanced 
and 
new 
prudential 
regulations have 
been 
prepared 
and 
formally 
approved 
by 
the 
NBS. 
Banks 
are 
also 
now 
required 
to 
adhere 
to 
and 
report 
according 
to International 
Accounting 
Standards 
(IAS), 
consistent 
with 
the 
recently 
passed 
new 
Accounting 
Law. 
Annual 
reports 
for 
the 
financial 
year 
2003 
will 
be 
prepared 
and 
reported 
using 
IAS. 
We 
also 
recognize the 
need 
to 
strengthen 
the 
legal 
and 
institutional regime 
for 
deposit 
insurance. 
More 
than 
a 
decade ago, 
the 
former 
SFRY 
established the 
Bank 
Rehabilitation 
Agency 
(BRA) 
to 
be 
the 
deposit 
insurer 
for 
the 
banking 
system. 
In 
September 
2001, 
in 
order 
to quickly 
implement 
the 
initial 
steps 
of 
the 
significant bank resolution 
program 
we 
described 
to 
you 
in 
our 
LDP 
of 
April 
2002, 
the mandate 
and 
powers 
of 
the 
BRA 
were 
expanded 
to include 
bank liquidation 
functions. 
However, 
we 
recognize that the 
BRA 
Law 
does 
not 
provide 
the 
interim 
corporate 
governance 
and 
financial 
management arrangements 
that 
are 
required 
to 
ensure 
the separation 
of 
responsibilities, 
accountability, 
and 
resources 
for 
it 
to 
carry 
out effectively 
its 
current 
dual 
mandate. 
In 
addition, 
the 
levels 
of 
premiums 
and 
coverage 
of 
deposit 
insurance have 
not 
been adjusted 
over 
time to 
reflect 
the 
changing 
state 
and 
structure 
of 
the 
banking 
system 
and 
macroeconomic 
conditions. 
Thus 
the 
deposit insurance 
fund 
is 
not 
sufficient to 
provide 
the 
financial 
resources 
to 
reimburse 
insured 
depositors 
in 
case 
of 
a 
significant 
bank 
failure. 
Although 
it 
is 
difficult to 
estimate 
the 
level 
of 
money 
laundering, 
we 
remain 
concerned that Serbia 
may 
continue 
to 
be 
a 
transit 
country 
for 
smuggling between 
Asia 
and 
the Balkans. 
A 
lack 
of 
funds 
and 
modem 
equipment  hinders 
monitoring 
of 
goods 
transiting 
the 
country. 
These 
factors 
together 
with 
the 
still- 
developing 
supervisory 
capacity 
in 
the 
banking 
system 
make 
Serbia 
a 
prime 
target 
for 
money 
laundering. 
In 
line 
with 
best 
international 
practice, 
during 
2002 
our Government 
began 
efforts to 
combat 
money 
laundering through 
a 
new 
anti-money laundering 
law 
(AML) 
which 
took effect 
on 
July 
1, 
2002. 
The 
new 
6 
Page  47
AML 
law 
authorized 
the 
creation 
of 
a 
Serbian 
financial 
intelligence 
unit 
(FIU) 
with 
the 
following 
functions: 
(i) 
receive 
reports 
of 
suspicious 
transactions 
from 
financial 
institutions 
and 
develop 
a 
database; 
(ii) 
analyze 
the reports 
to 
identify 
possible 
criminal 
activity; 
(iii) 
forward 
reports 
of 
suspect 
transactions 
to 
appropriate 
law 
enforcement 
officials 
for 
investigation and 
possible 
prosecution; 
and, 
(iv) 
establish 
effective 
cooperation 
with 
foreign 
counterpart 
FIUs 
to 
share 
information. 
Insurance 
regulation 
and 
supervision 
in 
Serbia 
was 
carried 
out 
by 
the Insurance 
Supervisory 
Authority 
(ISA) 
department 
within 
the 
former 
Federal 
Ministry 
of 
Finance. 
Today,  those 
responsibilities 
are 
being 
transferred 
to 
the 
Serbian 
MOFE. 
Activities 
of 
insurance companies 
and their 
supervision 
are 
regulated 
by 
the 
Law 
on 
Property and 
Personal 
Insurance, 
as 
well 
as 
six 
additional  regulations  that 
have 
been 
enacted 
by 
the 
ISA. 
However, 
we 
are 
aware 
that 
the  current 
insurance 
legislative 
and 
regulatory 
framework 
does 
not 
comply 
with 
internationally 
accepted 
insurance 
regulatory 
and 
supervisory 
principles 
and 
needs 
modernizing,  and 
that 
no 
effective 
supervision 
takes 
place 
because 
the 
ISA 
is 
understaffed 
and 
lacks 
qualified 
staff. 
Priority 
reforms. 
In 
the 
area 
of 
bank 
supervision, 
our Government and 
the 
NBS 
are 
fully 
committed 
to 
the 
implementation 
phase 
of 
the 
SDP 
and 
the 
development 
of 
a 
new 
supervisory 
approach. 
This 
is, 
in 
part, 
addressed 
through 
the 
overall 
supervisory 
strategy that 
has 
been 
prepared 
in 
conjunction 
with 
the 
mission 
statement. 
Implementation 
of 
the 
new 
methodology 
also 
will 
be 
promoted through 
the 
further 
preparation 
and refinement 
of 
supervisory 
strategies 
for 
each 
bank 
in 
the 
system. 
Other 
steps 
that 
will 
support 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
methodology include: 
(i) 
establishing 
lines 
of 
delegated 
decision 
making 
within 
the 
supervisory 
department; 
(ii) 
establishing 
a 
system 
of 
internal 
MIS 
for 
senior 
and 
executive management 
and 
SRC reporting; 
(iii) 
elevation 
of 
the 
role 
and responsibility 
of 
bank 
boards 
and 
management 
through 
increased 
supervisory 
interaction; 
and 
(iv) 
enhancing 
the 
schedule 
of 
risk 
stratified 
bank 
examinations 
to 
be 
completed 
during 
the 
upcoming 
year. 
The 
examination 
procedure 
manual and 
the 
bank 
risk 
rating 
system 
will 
also 
continue 
to 
be refined 
during 
the 
upcoming 
period. 
In 
addition to 
the 
above-mentioned 
improvements 
to 
bank 
supervision, 
our Government and 
the 
NBS 
will 
make 
several 
legislative 
changes 
needed 
to 
reflect 
the 
new 
constitutional 
arrangement 
between 
Serbia and 
Montenegro. 
The 
legal 
basis 
for 
the 
former 
NBY 
has 
already been 
adjusted 
to 
establish the 
new NBS. 
The 
former 
“Law 
on 
the 
National 
Bank 
of 
Yugoslavia” 
will 
be 
changed 
to reflect 
the 
new 
framework. 
In 
consultation 
with 
the 
World 
Bank, 
a 
new 
Law 
on 
the 
National 
of 
Serbia 
is 
expected 
to be 
drafted 
and 
passed 
by 
Parliament before 
the 
end 
of 
this year and 
will 
ensure 
the continued 
independence 
of 
the 
NBS 
and, thus, 
the 
ability 
of 
the 
supervisory 
function 
to 
make 
and 
administer decisions 
free 
from 
political 
and 
other outside 
interference. 
Likewise, 
the governance 
of 
the 
NBS 
will 
be 
further strengthened 
with 
the 
new 
law, 
by 
requiring 
the 
appointment 
of 
a 
supervisory 
board 
that 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
the 
oversight 
of 
the 
NBS 
and 
its 
key 
functions. 
Changes 
to prudential 
banking 
regulation 
are 
expected 
to 
support 
the 
evolving 
supervisory 
process. 
Specifically, 
new 
supporting 
regulation 
for 
the 
licensing 
process 
is 
planned. 
This 
will 
be 
particularly 
important 
in 
light 
of 
the ownership 
and 
structural 
changes 
the 
banking industry 
is 
currently 
undergoing. 
With 
regards 
to 
deposit 
insurance 
reform,  the 
BRA’S 
deposit 
insurance 
division, 
with 
support 
from 
the 
World 
Bank 
and 
key 
donors,  has 
made 
progress 
in 
setting 
up 
basic procedures 
to 
ensure 
accurate 
and 
prompt 
payment 
of 
premiums, reimbursement 
of 
depositors’  claims, and 
collection 
of 
premiums 
from 
the 
insured 
institutions. 
It 
is 
envisioned 
that once 
the 
bank 
resolution 
program 
is 
completed, 
the 
BRA 
would 
function 
only 
as 
the deposit insurer. 
In 
this 
regard, 
our 
Government 
has 
decided 
to 
migrate towards 
a 
new 
deposit  insurance 
scheme 
that 
will 
be 
consistent 
with 
EU 
Directives, 
internationally recognized 
best 
practices, 
and 
in 
line 
with 
the  expected  structure 
and 
risk 
profile 
of 
the 
banking 
system  and 
macroeconomic 
conditions. 
To 
that 
end, 
we 
will: 
(i) 
amend the 
law 
and 
statute 
of 
the 
BRA 
to 
introduce 
institutional 
and corporate  governance 
arrangements 
enabling an 
effective 
cohabitation 
of 
the 
deposit 
insurer 
and 
bank liquidator 
for 
the 
time 
necessary 
to 
complete the 
bank resolution 
program; 
(ii) 
increase 
- 
7 
Page  48
in 
the 
medium-term 
premiums 
collected 
from 
insured 
banks 
up 
to 
levels 
closer 
to 
that 
foreseen 
or 
foreseeable 
under 
the 
new 
deposit insurance 
law; 
and, 
(iii) 
prepare 
a 
new 
deposit insurance 
law. 
We 
also 
want to make 
it 
clear 
that 
we 
will 
not 
launch 
the 
implementation 
of 
this 
new 
deposit insurance 
scheme 
until 
actions 
to 
restructure the 
banking 
system have been 
substantially 
completed. 
On 
the 
anti-money 
laundering 
front, 
our Government 
will 
continue 
to 
support the development 
of 
the 
FIU 
with 
the 
objective 
ofjoining 
the 
Egmont 
Group 
of 
FIUs, 
in 
the near future. 
This 
support 
will 
include 
the 
provision 
of 
an 
adequate 
budget 
for 
the 
FIU 
in 
2003 
and 
following 
years. 
We 
will 
also 
continue 
to 
seek 
donor 
support 
and 
cooperation 
for 
the 
FIU, 
and 
will 
ensure 
that 
the 
FIU 
demonstrates 
that 
it 
can 
protect 
and 
process 
confidential financial 
information 
in 
support 
of 
international 
and 
domestic investigations and 
prosecutions 
of 
cases 
of 
money 
laundering and terrorist financing. 
Finally, 
in 
order 
to 
support 
the 
modernization 
of 
the 
regulatory and 
supervisory 
framework 
for 
the 
insurance 
sector, 
our 
Government 
will 
develop and 
implement 
a 
new 
insurance 
law 
compliant 
with 
IAIS 
core 
supervisory 
principles 
in 
areas 
such 
as 
licensing, 
changes 
in 
control,  investment  regulation,  and 
internal audit function. 
We 
are 
also 
committed 
to 
establishing 
a 
new 
insurance 
supervisory 
unit 
within 
the 
MOFE, 
and to developing and implementing 
an 
action 
plan 
to 
strengthen insurance supervision.

Medium-term 
reform 
objectives. 
The 
rapid 
evolution 
of 
the 
financial 
system, 
growth, 
new 
products, 
and 
new 
and 
changing 
risk 
profiles 
in 
banks, 
insurance 
companies, 
and 
other participants 
in 
the 
financial 
sector means 
that 
in 
the 
medium 
term our 
Government 
must 
take 
further 
steps 
to modernize 
and 
reform 
the 
functioning 
of 
mechanisms 
for 
the 
supervision and 
regulation 
of 
the 
sector. 
In 
the 
banking 
sector, 
our 
Government 
would 
fully 
support the 
NBS 
to 
(i) 
further 
develop offsite 
monitoring 
processes 
and early 
warning 
systems 
and 
firmly 
entrenched 
them 
supervisory 
process, 
(ii) 
make 
the 
examination 
process 
risk 
focused, 
and 
(iii) 
ensure 
that 
the 
processes 
and mechanisms 
within 
the 
NBS, 
such 
as 
the 
SRC, 
early 
8 
Page  49
warning 
systems, 
and 
overall 
supervisory procedures 
continue 
to 
be 
refined 
in 
order 
to 
more 
effectively 
anticipate the 
future 
systemic risks. 
In 
other 
areas 
of 
the 
financial 
sector, 
our 
Government’s 
medium  term 
objectives 
include: 
(i) 
implementing 
the 
revamping 
of 
the 
deposit insurance 
system 
in 
a 
manner consistent 
with 
EU 
Directives, 
internationally 
recognized 
best 
practices, 
and 
in 
line 
with 
the 
expected structure 
and 
risk 
profile 
of 
the 
banking 
system 
following 
the  outcome 
of 
ongoing 
restructuring 
efforts; 
(ii) 
continuing 
the 
adequate 
operation 
of 
the 
Serbian 
FIU 
in 
accordance 
with 
acceptable 
international 
standards 
to 
combat 
AML; 
and 
(iii) 
establishing 
an 
adequate 
regulatory  and  supervisory 
framework 
for 
the  insurance 
sector, 
and 
restructuring 
and privatizing 
the 
state 
insurance 
sector. 
Beyond 
the specific 
banking 
and 
insurance 
issues 
described 
in 
this 
letter, 
our 
Government 
will 
also 
start 
formulating 
a 
longer 
term 
strategy 
to define 
the 
level 
of 
integration 
of 
the broader 
financial 
sector 
to 
ultimately 
extend 
its 
regulatory  and supervisory 
capacity 
to 
all 
non-bank 
financial 
institutions. 
IV. 
Privatization 
and 
Restructuring 
of 
Banks 
and Enterprises 
A. 
Banking 
Sector 
Reform 
Context. 
As 
it 
was 
stated 
in 
our 
LDP 
of 
April 
2002, 
supported 
by 
the 
World 
Bank’s 
PFSAC 
I 
and 
related 
technical 
assistance 
projects, 
we 
have 
made 
significant 
progress 
in 
the restructuring 
of 
the 
banking 
sector 
during 
2001. These 
efforts 
culminated 
with 
the 
closure 
of 
the 
four 
largest 
state 
banks 
in 
January 2002. 
During 
this 
period, 
23 
insolvent 
banks representing 
some 
two 
thirds 
of 
the 
assets 
of 
the system were 
closed. 
Following 
legislative 
amendments 
we 
made 
in 
mid-200 
1, 
the 
BRA 
became 
the 
designated 
administrator 
for 
banks 
in 
bankruptcy 
and, 
with 
substantial 
donor 
and 
Bank 
support, 
it 
has 
successfully 
executed 
these 
duties. 
The implementation 
of 
remedial 
plans 
for 
the 
five 
banks that were 
in 
rehabilitation 
in 
the 
BRA 
at 
the 
end 
of 
2001 
continued 
during 
2002 
and, 
as 
a 
result, 
four 
of 
these 
banks 
were merged to 
form 
a 
viable 
larger 
bank 
- 
Niska 
Banka 
- 
in 
late 
2002, 
which 
was 
recapitalized 
by 
the 
BRA 
and 
now 
meets 
prudential 
requirements. 
Niska 
Banka, 
which 
now 
has 
positive 
income and 
operating 
cash 
flows, 
is 
expected 
to 
be 
a 
candidate 
for 
early privatization 
during 
this 
year. 
The remaining bank 
in 
rehabilitation 
has 
been 
thoroughly 
analyzed 
by 
the 
BRA 
and 
the 
NBS 
and 
is 
considered 
to 
be 
non-viable. 
Yet 
due 
to 
its 
political 
and 
social  sensitivity, 
we 
have  considered 
prudent 
to 
delay 
until 
the 
end 
of 
this 
year 
to 
commence 
its 
liquidation 
or 
gradual 
closing. 
As 
a 
result 
of 
the restructuring 
process 
and 
the 
entry 
of 
a 
number 
of 
foreign 
banks, 
confidence 
has 
begun 
to 
return 
to 
the 
banking 
system. 
This 
is 
evidenced 
by 
the 
rapid growth 
of 
foreign 
exchange 
deposits, 
which 
rose 
from 
Euro 
32 
million 
at 
end-June, 
2001, 
to 
nearly 
Euro 
1 
billion 
at 
end-2002. 
Progress 
has 
also been 
made 
during 
2002 
in 
reducing 
the 
state 
majority 
stake 
in 
the 
recently 
created 
National 
Savings 
Bank 
(NSB) 
and 
in 
separating 
its 
governance 
from 
the 
NBS. 
During 
2002 
while 
we 
worked 
on 
developing 
a 
viable 
strategy 
for 
the 
resolution 
of 
the 
still 
large number 
of 
banks 
with 
asset 
quality 
problems. 
One 
response 
to this 
challenge 
was 
the 
passage 
of 
the 
PLC 
Law 
in 
July 
2002, 
which 
provided 
for 
the mandatory debt-to-equity conversion 
of 
banks’ 
PLC 
liabilities 
into 
equity to 
be owned 
by 
the 
state. 
The 
consequence 
of 
this 
law 
has 
been that the 
state has 
acquired 
a 
significant 
stake 
in 
17 
banks, 
including 
a 
majority 
state 
position 
in 
two 
of 
the 
three 
largest banks 
in 
the 
system, 
and 
a 
significant 
stake 
in 
the 
largest 
private 
bank. 
We 
are 
conscious 
that 
the 
PLC 
Law 
also 
stipulated 
our 
obligation 
to 
initiate 
the 
privatization 
process 
of 
these 
banks 
within 
six 
months 
of 
the actual 
execution 
of 
the debt-to-equity 
conversion. 
In 
this 
regard, 
and 
in 
close 
coordination 
with 
the 
PFSAC 
program, 
we 
have 
recently 
approved 
a 
comprehensive 
banking 
resolution 
strategy 
which 
centers 
on 
attempts 
to privatize 
the 
PLC 
Law-affected 
banks 
without 
the 
use 
of 
fiscal 
resources. 
We 
have also 
implemented 
enhanced 
controls 
and 
governance 
over 
the 
affected banks 
to 
preserve 
their 
value, 
and launched 
diagnostic audits 
of 
state 
majority 
ownership banks 
(and one 
additional 
9 
Page  50
private 
bank 
with 
a 
significant 
state 
participation) 
to 
ascertain 
their 
true 
condition 
after 
application 
of 
the 
provisions 
of 
the 
PLC 
Law. 
In 
parallel 
to 
these 
efforts, 
we 
have launched 
tenders 
for 
a 
strategic 
advisor 
to 
the 
Government 
for 
the 
privatization 
process 
and 
for 
privatization 
advisers 
for 
the 
first 
three 
banks 
that 
we 
intend 
to 
sale 
before 
the 
end 
of 
this 
year. 
Priority 
reforms. 
Our 
program 
for reform 
of 
the 
banking 
system 
builds 
on 
the 
progress 
made 
under 
PFSAC 
I, 
and 
targets 
resolving 
the 
interconnected problems 
of 
the 
PLC 
debts 
of 
banks 
and 
enterprises. 
The first 
phase 
of 
the bank restructuring 
program 
will 
move 
towards 
issuing 
a 
tender 
for 
the 
privatization 
of 
Niska 
Banka 
in 
late 
2003 
and, 
during 
the 
course 
of 
2003, 
the 
resolution 
of 
the 
remaining 
two 
banks 
under 
BRA 
control for 
which 
recapitalization and privatization 
is 
not 
a 
viable 
option. 
Further 
progress 
will 
be 
made 
in 
the 
liquidation 
of 
the 
non-financial 
assets 
of 
bankrupt 
banks 
being 
liquidated 
by 
the 
BRA, 
with 
the target 
of 
completing 
the 
sale 
or 
leasing 
out 
40 
percent 
of 
these 
assets 
by 
end-2003. 
The 
phase 
of 
bank 
restructuring 
associated 
to 
the 
enactment 
of 
the 
PLC 
law 
will 
accelerate 
as 
a 
result 
of 
our adoption 
of 
a 
comprehensive strategy 
to privatize 
or 
liquidate 
all 
banks 
that 
have 
been 
affected. 
Our 
strategy 
emphasizes 
the 
need 
for 
implementing 
controls and 
adequate 
governance 
over 
the 
operations 
of 
the 
banks. 
Thus 
we 
are 
fully 
committed 
to 
exerting 
such 
controls 
to 
the  extent 
that 
is 
necessary 
to 
maintain 
the value 
of 
these 
banks 
during 
the 
pre-privatization 
period. 
Consistent 
with 
this objective, 
we 
will 
require 
diagnostic 
audits 
and 
the 
application 
of 
reinforced 
supervisory 
measures 
(including 
closure) 
for 
banks 
found to 
be  insolvent. 
As 
stated, 
our 
strategy 
excludes 
the 
possibility 
of 
utilizing 
fiscal 
resources 
to 
recapitalize 
banks 
and provides workable institutional 
arrangements 
to 
manage 
and 
execute 
the 
implementation 
process. 
Additional 
work 
is 
now 
underway  to 
develop 
a 
parallel 
strategy 
for 
integrating 
the 
resolution 
of 
PLC 
assets 
now 
held 
by 
the banks 
with 
the 
privatization 
and restructuring 
program 
for 
state 
and 
socially 
owned 
enterprises. 
The 
Bank 
and 
donors 
are 
providing 
substantial 
technical 
assistance 
support 
for 
implementation 
of 
the 
PLC 
bank resolution 
and 
privatization 
strategy. 
Finally, 
we 
will 
also 
signal 
our intention 
to 
privatize 
the 
banking 
system 
by 
continuing 
a transparent 
and 
competitive 
divestiture 
of 
the 
most 
of 
the 
remaining 
state-controlled 
ownership 
of 
the 
NSB 
by 
end-2003.

Medium-term reform 
objectives. 
We 
recognize 
that 
completing 
the 
restructuring 
and 
privatization 
of 
the 
banking 
sector 
is 
a 
pre-requisite 
for 
the 
full 
development 
of 
the 
financial 
sector’s 
ability to 
support 
economic 
growth. Accordingly, 
we 
have adopted 
an 
ambitious 
medium 
term 
agenda 
to 
be 
completed 
by 
end-2004, 
which 
aims 
at: 
(i) 
completion 
of 
the 
resolution 
of 
all 
remaining 
state stakes 
in 
banks 
(including 
all 
of 
the 
PLC 
Law-affected 
banks); 
(ii) 
closure 
of 
all 
remaining  insolvent 
banks; 
(iii) 
aggressive 
disposition 
of 
the non-financial 
assets 
of 
bank 
receiverships; 
(iv) 
completion 
of 
the 
liquidation 
or 
leasing 
out 
of 
the 
assets 
of 
banks 
which 
were 
closed 
in 
2001-2002; 
and, 
(v) 
rapid 
progress 
in 
the resolution 
of 
non-performing 
bankrupt 
and 
PLC 
law-affected 
banks’ 
claims 
on 
the enterprise 
sector. 
B. 
Enterprise 
Sector 
Reform 
Context. 
The  real 
sector 
in 
Serbia  remains 
in 
very 
poor 
condition. 
The 
past 
decade 
brought 
macroeconomic  instability, 
loss 
of 
markets, 
and 
isolation 
from 
technological 
advances. 
The 
mass 
of 
productive 
assets 
tied 
up 
in 
socially- 
or 
state-owned 
enterprises 
(SOEs) 
requires change 
of 
ownership 
and, 
in 
many 
cases, 
restructuring 
if 
these 
firms 
are 
to 
survive 
and 
compete 
in 
open, 
global 
markets. 
Our 
privatization 
strategy, 
as 
described 
in 
the 
LDP 
for PFSAC 
I, 
is 
based 
on 
the 
Privatization 
Law 
adopted, 
with 
the 
Bank 
support, 
in 
June 
2001, 
and 
incorporating 
the 
international 
best 
practice 
and 
lessons 
learned 
from 
other 
transition 
economies. 
The 
law 
requires 
offering 
to 
a strategic 
investor 
at 
least 
70 
percent 
of 
the 
shares. 
An 
amendment 
to 
the 
Privatization 
Law, 
adopted 
by 
the Parliament 
in 
March 
2003, 
provides 
full 
and 
exclusive 
authority  to 
the 
Privatization 
Agency 
(PA) 
to 
negotiate 
and 
sign 
sale 
and 
purchase 
agreements. 
This 
is 
a 
major 
achievement 
because,  due 
to 
the  legacy 
of 
social 
ownership, 
before the 
amendment, 
employees’ 
representatives 
could 
refuse 
to 
sign 
the 
agreements 
if 
they 
did 
not like 
the 
investor 
who 
won 
the 
tender. 
Priority 
reforms. 
The 
MOEP 
and 
the 
PA 
have 
the mandate 
to 
offer 
for 
sale 
the capital 
or 
property 
of 
about 
4,000 
SOEs 
over 
the 
next 
three 
years. 
According 
to our 
estimates, 
among 
these SOEs, 
some  100 
companies 
can 
be 
privatized through 
tenders 
to 
strategic 
investors. 
Another 
1,500 
to 
2,000 
companies 
can 
be 
sold through 
auctions 
and 
a 
limited 
number 
(probably 
less 
that 
100) 
can 
be 
restructured 
and 
privatized, 
all 
or 
in 
part. 
The 
remaining 
companies 
will 
have to 
be 
subject 
to 
bankruptcy. 
The initial 
progress 
made 
by 
the 
PA 
in 
implementing 
the 
Government’s ambitious 
privatization 
program, 
supported 
under 
PFSAC 
I, 
has 
been 
considerable, 
although 
we 
acknowledge 
that 
in 
some areas 
(see 
below),  serious 
problems 
remain 
and 
if 
not 
resolved, 
will 
undermine 
the 
process. 
The 
auction 
privatization 
program 
has 
been 
moving 
forward 
with 
new 
momentum 
following 
a 
revision 
of 
the 
Auctions 
Decree 
in 
July 
2002, 
which 
simplified 
the 
process 
and reduced the 
unreasonable 
starting 
price. 
This 
flexible 
approach 
has 
greatly 
increased 
the 
participation 
in 
auctions 
and 
has 
led 
to 
a 
success 
rate 
of 
about 
70 
percent, 
with 
the 
PA 
now 
running 
two 
auctions 
a 
week. 
In 
the 
first 
half 
of 
2003, 
500 
companies 
will 
be 
auctioned, 
with 
another 
560 
expected 
to be 
auctioned 
by 
end 
of 
2003. 
The 
average 
selling price 
of 
the companies 
offered 
in 
auction 
averages 
about 
Euro 
300,000. 
Under 
the 
tender 
program 
managed 
by 
the 
PA 
with 
the 
help 
of 
TA 
provided 
by 
the 
World 
Bank 
and other 
donors, 
twelve 
groups 
(pools), 
comprising 
55 
companies, 
have 
now 
been contracted 
to 
investment 
banks. 
We 
have 
identified 
two 
main 
obstacles 
that 
slowed 
the 
initial 
progress 
of 
the 
tender 
program: 
(i) 
excessive 
company 
staffing 
levels; 
and 
(ii) 
overly 
ambitious social 
program 
requirements 
imposed 
on 
the 
potential 
investors. 
The 
excessive 
staffing 
levels and 
mandatory 
social programs 
reflect the legacy 
of 
the Yugoslav 
social ownership 
philosophy 
under 
which 
employees 
and 
managers 
share 
the fortunes 
of 
the 
company and 
dominate  the  decision 
making 
process. 
However, 
the  experience 
of 
the 
initial 
failed 
tenders 
has 
demonstrated that 
the 
social programs 
deterred buyers, 
as 
they 
were 
required 
to 
guarantee 
employment 
for  three 
to 
five 
years 
to 
redundant 
employees. 
Consequently, 
we 
decided 
to 
reduce the requirement that 
the 
buyers 
retain 
all 
employees 
for five 
years (three 
years 
for 
some companies) 
to 
one 
year 
and 
to commit 
to 
pay 
an 
agreed 
level 
of 
severance 
to 
redundant 
employees 
as 
part 
of 
the 
sale agreement. 
We 
will 
make 
Page  52
these 
revised 
terms 
known 
to 
buyers 
as 
part 
of 
the  tender 
documentation  and the 
our  commitments 
regarding 
severance 
payments 
would 
be 
made 
effective 
at 
the 
time 
of 
the 
sale. 
We 
estimate 
that the 
cost 
of 
redundancies 
for 
companies expected 
to 
be 
sold 
in 
year 2003 
will 
be 
about 
US$17.2 
million 
or 
1.1 
billion 
dinars. 
The 
companies 
in 
the 
tender 
program 
that 
have 
not 
yet 
been tendered 
will 
be 
offered 
with 
the 
new 
social 
terms and 
conditions 
as 
will 
those that 
did 
not 
sell 
in 
previous 
tenders. 
Depending 
on 
their 
size 
and 
financial 
conditions, 
enterprises 
that 
attract 
no 
satisfactory 
bids 
in 
the 
tender 
process 
will 
be 
either 
auctioned, 
or 
put 
into 
restructuring, 
or 
put 
into 
bankruptcy. 
We 
are 
also 
undertaking 
some tender 
privatizations 
using 
the 
Government’s 
own 
financing. 
For 
example, 
a 
number 
of 
sugar companies 
are 
being privatized 
as 
well 
as 
Beopetrol, 
an 
oil 
distribution 
company. 
Our 
Government 
has 
opened 
tenders 
for 
two 
tobacco 
companies, 
and 
is 
considering 
selling 
its 
interest 
in 
Mobtel, 
a 
mobile 
telephone company. 
The 
heavily 
indebted 
steel conglomerate 
Sartid 
had 
been 
placed 
in 
bankruptcy under 
the 
existing Bankruptcy 
Law. 
Recently, the 
bankruptcy 
administrator 
has 
entered 
into 
an 
agreement 
with 
US 
Steel 
to 
purchase 
andor 
manage 
certain 
components. 
Finally, 
in 
2002, 
we 
have 
sold 
minority 
shares 
in 
48 
companies 
privatized 
under 
the 
1997 
Law 
for 
total 
worth 
of 
Euro 
82 
million. 
We 
are 
committed 
to 
keep 
the 
public 
and 
donor 
community 
informed 
on 
progress 
for 
these 
privatizations 
and 
to 
use 
open, 
transparent 
and 
competitive methods 
in 
their 
sale. 
In 
recent 
months, 
we 
have 
tentatively 
selected 
50 
large 
problematic 
SOEs 
to 
undergo 
privatization 
through  restructuring 
according 
to 
relevant 
provisions 
contained 
in 
the 
Privatization 
Law 
and 
the 
Restructuring 
Decree. 
Using 
the 
technical 
assistance 
funding 
provided 
by 
the 
World Bank 
and 
other 
donors, 
the 
PA 
is 
currently 
in 
the process 
of 
engaging 
internationally 
reputed 
teams 
of 
financial 
advisors 
to lead 
the preparation 
and implementation 
of 
privatization through 
restructuring programs 
for 
most 
of 
the 
companies 
on 
the 
list 
of 
50. 
In 
particular, 
under the recently 
approved 
World 
Bank’s 
TA 
Credit, the 
PA 
has 
engaged 
financial 
advisors 
to 
work 
on 
four 
large 
SOEs 
in 
its 
portfolio, 
with 
advisors 
for 
three 
more 
conglomerates 
to 
be 
hired 
by 
mid-2003. 
Our 
restructuring 
strategy 
calls 
for 
the segmentation 
(in 
a 
typical 
case) 
of 
the 
company, 
incorporation 
of 
new 
companies created 
from 
parts 
of 
the 
old 
one, 
and 
sale 
of 
these 
new 
companies 
and 
assets 
remaining 
after the break 
up. 
This 
process 
will 
consist 
of 
three 
stages: 
(i) 
a 
feasibility 
study 
and 
a 
due 
diligence 
report, 
serving 
as 
the 
basis 
for 
preparation 
of 
the 
restructuring 
program 
by 
financial 
advisors; 
(ii) 
implementation 
of 
financial, 
organizational, 
legal, 
and 
workforce 
restructuring, 
including 
(if 
necessary) 
the 
incorporation 
of 
the 
new 
companies created 
from 
parts 
of 
the 
old 
one 
and 
negotiations 
with 
creditors; 
and 
(iii) 
privatization 
of 
the 
saleable business 
units 
by 
tender 
or 
auction, 
and 
disposing 
of 
all 
other 
assets 
remaining 
after 
the 
reorganization 
through  bankruptcy 
procedures. 
This 
model 
will 
be 
based 
on 
a 
transaction-oriented 
approach, 
where the 
ultimate 
sale 
of 
the 
enterprise 
or 
its 
various 
viable 
parts drives 
the 
restructuring effort. 
The underlying 
premise 
of 
this 
exercise 
is 
that 
various 
subsidiaries 
andor 
assets 
of 
loss-making 
SOEs 
can 
be 
viable 
and  attractive 
to 
potential 
investors 
even 
if 
as 
a 
whole 
these 
conglomerates 
are 
presently non-viable and 
non-saleable. 
We 
expect 
to 
have the 
first 
sales 
resulting 
from 
restructuring 
program 
in 
the second 
half 
of 
2003. 
We 
recognize 
that 
central 
to 
the  successful 
implementation 
of 
enterprise 
and 
banking 
sectors 
reform 
program 
lies 
the need 
to 
deal 
with 
the 
excessive 
debt 
burden 
present 
in 
the 
economy, 
which 
affects 
both: 
(i) 
bank 
privatization,  where  prospective  buyers 
-- 
traditionally 
strategic 
investors 
--normally 
would 
prefer 
banks 
to 
be 
cleansed 
of 
their 
non-performing 
loan 
portfolios 
before the 
sale; 
and, 
(ii) 
enterprise 
privatization 
because 
the 
ability 
of 
the 
PA 
to 
restructure 
andor 
privatize 
large 
heavily 
indebted 
enterprises 
is 
affected 
by 
its 
ability 
to 
secure 
the 
agreement 
of 
creditors 
of 
the 
enterprises. 
The first 
step 
in 
that 
direction 
is 
the 
existing 
Memorandum 
of 
Understanding 
(MOU), 
now 
anchored 
in 
a 
government 
decree, 
between 
the 
PA 
and 
the 
BRA 
which 
addresses 
the 
way 
in 
which 
the 
BRA 
will 
fulfill 
its 
obligations 
to 
the 
courts 
and the 
creditors 
of 
the 
bankrupt 
banks, 
in 
a 
manner 
that 
does 
not 
impede the 
privatization 
of 
socially owned 
enterprises. 
We 
are 
currently 
working to 
develop 
a 
broader 
strategy, 
12 
Page  53
including 
proper legal 
and 
institutional 
mechanisms, 
for 
resolution 
of 
claims 
held 
by 
state (arrears 
to 
tax 
authorities 
and 
various 
public 
funds) 
and 
quasi-state 
entities 
(debt 
to 
PLC 
Law-affected 
banks 
and 
utilities) 
against 
a select 
group 
of 
large 
SOEs 
scheduled 
for 
case-by-case 
privatization 
and 
restructuring. 
An 
integral 
part 
of 
our 
reform 
program 
will 
be 
to 
address 
the 
social 
impact 
of 
restructuring  and 
privatization. 
The 
privatization or 
restructuring 
program 
for 
each enterprise 
prepared 
with 
the 
help 
of 
financial 
advisors 
will 
include 
a 
labor redeployment 
plan, 
which 
will 
outline 
severance 
or 
other 
packages 
for 
redundant 
workers 
and receive 
financing 
from 
the Serbian 
budget. 
Enterprise-specific 
programs 
would 
be 
guided 
by 
the 
policy 
framework  outlined 
in 
the 
Government’s 
Social 
Program 
for 
employees 
dismissed 
during 
restructuring  and  privatization,  approved 
by 
the 
Government 
in 
March 
2002. 
The 
Program 
is 
intended 
to 
provide 
a 
menu 
of 
compensation 
and 
redeployment options 
for 
dismissed 
workers 
in 
the 
large 
SOEs. 
The Program 
provides 
a 
unified 
approach 
for 
dealing 
with 
social 
costs 
of 
transition 
and 
minimizes 
the 
prospects 
of 
ad 
hoc 
settlements 
for 
dismissed 
workers 
across 
different 
sectors. 
Retrenched 
workers 
may 
choose 
between: 
(i) 
a 
lump-sum 
payment 
equivalent 
to 
Euro 
1,000 
or Euro 
100 
per 
year 
of 
service 
(whichever 
is 
higher), 
and 
(ii) 
payment 
for 
up 
to 
two 
years, 
depending 
on 
length 
of 
service, 
at 
40- 
80 
percent 
of 
the 
average 
wage 
in 
Serbia. 
The 
2003 
budget includes 
a 
special 
allocation 
of 
7.5 
billion 
dinars 
(equivalent 
to US$125 
million) 
to 
provide 
the payments 
to 
employees 
of 
companies 
covered 
by 
the 
Social 
Program, 
and 
a 
comparable 
allocation 
will 
be provided 
in 
the 
next 
year’s 
budget. 
Given 
the 
high 
fiscal 
cost 
of 
the Program, 
we 
are 
committed 
to 
prioritizing 
the payment 
of 
retrenchment  benefits 
to 
workers 
from 
those 
companies that 
are 
undergoing 
credible 
pre-privatization 
restructuring. 
We 
intend 
to 
ensure 
that 
fiscal 
costs 
are 
kept 
under 
control 
in 
the 
short 
run 
and 
reduced 
and eventually discontinued 
in 
the 
medium 
term. 
In 
the 
short 
run, 
we plan 
to  make 
the 
payments 
under  the 
Social 
Program 
more 
explicitly 
linked 
to 
specific 
benchmarks 
in 
enterprise 
restructuring 
and tender 
privatization 
process, 
such 
as 
the 
adoption 
by 
the 
PA 
of 
the enterprise 
restructuring 
and privatization 
programs, 
in 
order 
to 
ensure 
that 
public 
resources 
are 
spent 
only 
on 
enterprises 
which 
are 
fully 
committed 
to 
fundamental restructuring 
and 
change 
of 
ownership. 
We 
expect that 
any indirect 
environmental 
implications 
of 
the 
our 
enterprise 
reform 
program 
supported 
under 
PFSAC 
I1 
to 
be 
limited 
and 
primarily 
relate 
to 
the 
restructuring 
of 
some 
of 
the 
large 
SOEs. 
We 
are 
committed 
to 
ensure adequate 
environmental 
safeguards 
based 
on 
recommendations 
of 
the 
World 
Bank 
and 
to 
subject 
all 
major 
enterprises 
undergoing 
privatization 
through 
tender 
to 
environmental 
assessments. 
The 
results 
of 
the 
assessments 
are 
and 
will 
continue 
to 
be included 
in 
the 
Information 
Memoranda, 
which 
stipulate  the 
commitments 
that  the 
investorhuyer 
needs 
to 
undertake 
regarding 
possible 
environmental 
liabilities. 
In 
February 
2003, 
we 
initiated,  and 
the 
Parliament 
adopted, 
an 
amendment 
to 
the 
Privatization 
Law 
which 
stipulates 
the assumption 
by 
the 
state 
of 
liabilities 
for 
past 
environmental 
damages. 
The  methodology 
for 
determining 
the 
extent 
of 
these 
liabilities, 
as 
well 
as 
mechanisms 
for 
addressing them, 
will 
be 
described 
in 
a series 
of 
by-laws, 
to 
be 
developed 
jointly 
by 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Environment and 
MOEP 
and the 
PA, 
with 
the 
Bank’s  technical 
assistance. 
In 
the 
medium 
term, 
we 
expect, 
with 
the 
assistance 
of 
World 
Bank 
and 
other 
donors, 
to 
address 
the 
issues 
of 
environmental  compliance  and 
industrial 
pollution 
in 
the 
enterprise 
sector, 
and implement 
a 
reform 
agenda 
that 
would 
encompass 
improvement 
of 
the 
environment-related 
legislative framework, regulatory 
and 
institutional 
capacity, 
and 
mitigate 
the 
negative 
impact 
of 
the previous 
environmental policies 
and 
practices 
in 
the 
enterprise 
sector. 
Finally, 
we 
are 
seeking 
to 
resolve 
the 
problem 
of 
property 
nationalized 
during 
the  socialist  period. 
Building 
upon 
the 
Privatization 
Law 
adopted 
in 
June 2001, 
we 
have 
established 
a 
working 
group 
which 
has 
been 
working 
on 
a 
draft 
of 
a 
law 
on 
restitution. 
Following 
a 
participatory 
process 
of 
extensive 
consultation and 
taking 
into 
account 
public 
commentary, 
our 
Government 
intends 
to 
submit 
a 
draft 
law 
on 
restitution 
for 
consideration 
to 
the 
Parliament 
by 
December 2003. 
While 
the details 
of 
the 
law 
are 
still to 
be worked 
out, 
the 
law would 
be 
based 
on 
the 
following 
general principles: 
(i) 
compensation 
will 
be 
done, 
as 
a 
matter 
of 
general 
policy, through 
bonds, 
and 
will 
be 
substantially 
in 
accordance 
with 
principles 
13

of 
2001 Privatization 
Law; 
(ii) 
compensation 
will 
be 
done 
in 
a 
fiscally 
prudent 
manner; 
and 
(iii) 
to 
avoid 
the creation 
of 
new 
injustices, 
the 
legally 
owned 
non-state 
property 
shall 
not 
be 
restituted 
(in 
kind) 
to 
original 
owners; 
other 
forms 
of 
compensation 
will 
be 
used.

as 
agreed 
with 
the 
World 
Bank; 
and 
(vi) 
PA 
will 
start 
the tendering 
process 
by 
publishing 
a request 
for 
proposals 
and sending 
out 
an 
RFP 
to 
selected 
firms 
for 
a 
financial 
advisor 
to 
help 
it 
prepare 
and  implement  the 
restructuring 
programs 
for 
three 
more 
socially-owned 
conglomerates 
in 
the 
PA 
portfolio, 
as 
agreed 
with 
the 
World 
Bank. 
By

by 
the 
PLC 
Law-affected 
banks, 
bankrupt 
banks 
in 
BRA 
portfolio, public 
utilities, 
and 
various 
public

(ii) 
PA 
will 
sell 
through 
tender, 
initiate 
the

bankruptcy proceedings 
with 
respect 
to 
at 
least 35 
percent 
of 
the 
socially-owned 
enterprises 
agreed 
upon 
by 
the 
Government 
and 
the 
World 
Bank, 
including 
the 
provision 
in 
the 
offer 
of 
sale 
through 
tender 
of

by 
the 
Government and 
the 
World 
Bank, 
or 
will 
offer for 
sale 
viable 
parts 
of 
such 
enterprises. 
Medium-term 
reform 
objectives. 
We 
recognize 
that 
completing 
the 
restructuring and 
privatization 
of 
the 
socially- 
and state-owned enterprise 
sector 
is 
a 
pre-requisite 
for 
achieving 
sustainable 
economic 
growth 
in 
Serbia. 
Accordingly, 
we 
envision 
the 
following 
medium 
term 
agenda 
for 
2004-2005: 
0 
Tender 
and  auction  privatization 
programs 
will 
be 
continued 
in 
a  transparent, 
competitive 
manner, 
as 
provided 
for 
in 
the 
Privatization 
Law 
and 
related regulations. 
0 
Restructuring 
and 
subsequent 
privatization 
of 
large 
industrial 
conglomerates 
will 
be 
continued 
and 
accelerated 
once 
the 
effective legislative 
and 
regulatory 
framework 
for 
debt 
workout 
is 
fully 
put 
into 
place. 
Unsaleable 
conglomerates 
andor 
parts 
thereof 
will 
be 
put 
into 
bankruptcy under 
the 
new 
insolvency 
regime. 
0 
In 
parallel to continuing 
the 
privatization and 
restructuring 
of 
socially-owned 
enterprises, 
we plan 
to 
accelerate 
the 
reform 
of 
the 
troubled 
state 
sector 
of 
the 
economy. 
A 
number 
of 
the 
state-owned 
enterprises 
will 
be privatization 
candidates 
over 
the 
medium 
term 
once 
their  restructuring 
is 
further 
advanced 
and 
satisfactory 
regulatory 
regimes 
have 
been 
put 
in 
place. 
Enterprises  that 
would 
be 
considered 
for 
privatization 
are: 
(i) 
electricity 
generation, 
once 
unbundled  and 
satisfactory 
regulation 
is 
in 
place; 
(ii) 
telecommunications; 
(iii) 
oil 
refining 
and 
distribution;  and 
(iv) 
gas 
distribution. 
Privatization 
of 
railways 
and 
ports, 
including 
airports, 
are 
further 
in 
the 
future.

Conclusion 
We 
remain 
conscious that the 
challenges ahead 
of 
us 
are 
significant, and that 
our 
ambitious 
goals 
will 
require 
a 
concerted 
effort 
fiom 
our 
Governments. 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
we 
are 
confident  that 
this 
letter 
outlines 
a 
coherent 
reform 
agenda that 
includes 
the 
most 
crucial 
policy 
priorities 
to 
reform 
the 
enterprise 
and 
financial 
sectors. 
We 
remain 
convinced that 
both 
of 
this 
areas 
of 
reform 
are 
essential 
to 
achieving 
sustained 
growth 
and economic 
development. 
In 
closing, 
we 
just 
want 
to 
reiterate 
that the 
continued 
support 
of 
the 
World 
Bank 
and 
the 
international 
community 
will 
be 
essential 
if 
the 
SAM 
and 
Serbian 
Governments 
are 
to 
achieve 
these 
ambitious 
goals.

IMF 
Approves US$137 
Million 
Credit 
Disbursement 
Under 
Extended 
Arrangement 
with 
Serbia and 
Montenegro 
The Executive 
Board 
of 
the 
International 
Monetary 
Fund 
(IMF) 
today 
completed 
its 
first 
review 
of 
Serbia 
and 
Montenegro’s 
economic  performance  under the 
Extended 
Arrangement. 
This 
will 
enable  Serbia 
and 
Montenegro 
to 
draw 
SDR 
100 
million 
(about 
US$137 
million) 
under 
the 
arrangement 
immediately. 
The 
Extended 
Arrangement 
was 
approved 
on 
May 
14, 
2002 
for 
a 
total 
of 
SDR 
650 
million 
(about 
US$889 
million) 
to 
support Serbia 
and 
Montenegro’s  economic 
program 
in 
2002-2005 
(see 
Press 
Release 
No. 
02/25). 
So 
far, 
Serbia and 
Montenegro 
has 
drawn 
SDR 
100 
million 
(about 
US$137 
million) from 
the 
IMF. 
Following 
the 
Executive 
Board 
discussion, 
Anne 
Krueger, 
First 
Deputy 
Managing Director 
and 
Acting 
Chair, 
said: 
“The 
IMF 
commends 
the 
authorities 
of 
Serbia  and 
Montenegro 
for 
the 
impressive further 
progress 
in 
stabilization 
and 
reform 
achieved 
in 
2002. 
Firm 
macroeconomic 
policy 
implementation contributed 
to 
rapid 
disinflation, 
a 
strengthening 
of 
foreign 
reserves, 
and a 
continued recovery 
in 
output 
and 
exports. 
Significant 
advances 
were 
also made 
in 
structural 
reform. 
Equally 
welcome 
is 
the renewed 
commitment 
to 
reform 
of 
the 
new 
government 
formed 
following 
Premier 
Djindjic’s 
tragic 
assassination. 
“Looking 
ahead, 
continued 
prudence  and 
vigilance 
in 
policy 
implementation 
will 
remain 
essential 
to 
safeguard 
the 
authorities’ 
inflation 
and 
external 
objectives, 
especially 
in 
light 
of 
macroeconomic 
uncertainties  and 
the 
challenges 
remaining 
in 
the 
area 
of 
structural reform. 
On 
the 
macroeconomic  front, 
there 
is 
a need 
for 
a 
tightening 
of 
monetary 
policy 
and 
further 
fiscal 
consolidation. 
On 
the 
structural 
front, 
continued 
progress 
will 
require 
strong 
resolve 
as 
reforms 
move 
to 
a 
more 
difficult 
phase. 
The 
authorities’ 
demonstrated 
commitment 
to reform 
augurs 
well 
for 
achieving 
these 
objectives  and 
laying 
the 
basis 
for 
durable growth, 
and 
merits continued 
support 
from 
the 
international community. 
“Fiscal 
policy 
in 
2003 
will 
aim 
not 
only 
at 
containing 
the 
external 
imbalance, 
but 
will 
also 
continue 
to 
support 
restructuring 
and 
an 
appropriate social safety 
net. 
Owing 
to 
the 
unusual 
risks 
to 
the 
macroeconomic 
outlook 
and 
tax 
collections, 
the 
authorities 
intend 
to 
contain 
discretionary 
spending 
commitments 
below 
the 
program  level 
until 
revenue  prospects  become  clearer. 
Revenue 
efforts 
will 
focus 
on 
improving  tax 
administration 
and 
broadening the 
tax 
base. 
Fiscal 
transparency 
and 
management 
should 
improve 
with 
the 
channeling 
of 
all 
privatization 
proceeds 
through 
the 
budget 
and 
the planned 
use 
of 
any 
excess 
privatization 
proceeds 
to 
reduce 
the 
government’s 
net 
indebtedness. 
“The 
planned 
tightening 
of 
monetary 
policy 
will 
help 
lower inflation 
further 
and 
safeguard 
foreign 
reserves. 
Exchange rate 
policy 
should 
be 
kept 
under 
close 
review 
in 
light 
of 
trade, 
price, and 
wage 
developments and 
conditions 
in 
the 
interbank 
foreign 
exchange 
market. 
In 
light 
of 
the 
rapid 
increase 
in 
bank  credit 
to 
enterprises  since 
mid-2002, 
prudential 
regulations should 
be 
enforced 
strictly 
to 
ensure 
that 
new 
lending 
remains 
sound. 
The 
IMF 
welcomes 
the 
further 
liberalization 
of 
the 
country’s 
foreign 
exchange 
system 
and 
the authorities’ 
acceptance 
of 
the 
obligations 
under 
Article 
VIII, 
Sections 2,3, 
and 
4 
in 
2002.

“The 
formation 
of 
the 
state 
union 
of 
Serbia 
and 
Montenegro 
in 
early 
2003 
will 
enhance 
political 
stability 
and 
provide 
a 
unique 
window 
of 
opportunity 
for 
carrying 
forward 
the 
reform 
process. 
The 
envisaged 
normalization 
of 
economic 
relations  between 
Serbia  and 
Montenegro 
under 
the 
new 
constitutional 
framework-notably 
by 
harmonizing 
the 
trade, customs, 
and 
indirect 
tax 
regimes 
as 
they 
converge 
toward 
EU 
directives-should 
help improve 
economic 
efficiency 
in 
both 
states,” 
Ms. 
Krueger 
said.
