F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The objectives of the project are to assist the Borrower in the implementation of the
national payments system modernization program and banking system reform.

  Note: The above formulation of the Project Development Objectives (PDOs) is from
the original Credit Agreement because the Board was informed in the Project Paper dated

                                                  5
February 17, 2009 that the correct formulation of the PDOs is the one used in the Legal
Agreement. The Project Paper informed that there was a discrepancy in the formulation
(not the intent) of the PDOs, as formulated in the Credit Agreement (Schedule 2) and in
the PDO definition in the PAD and clarified that the observed discrepancy is of a
semantic nature and does not reflect a divergence in the intended objectives and scope of
the Project.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
The objective of the project is to assist the Borrower in the implementation of the
national payments system modernization program.

In the Level One restructuring of the project approved by the Board on June 10, 2012, the
targets for PDO Indicators 1 and 2 were increased in line with the extension of the
closing date to October 31, 2012. The PDO Indicator 3 was added as a new indicator to
measure the original outcome that was not measured in the PAD.

US$1.9 billion (in 2012 prices). After its independence, the country achieved greater
macroeconomic stability and took major steps in introducing the conditions necessary for
the development of a market-based economy. This included land reform, liberalization of

were taken over bank closures and consolidation, portfolio carve out, and strengthened
supervision. There were then 20 banks, of which two – Savings and Settlement Company
(SSC) and Kairat – were state-owned. The banking sector was small, with US$210
million of total assets in mid-2003 (about 11.5 percent of 2002 GDP). Basic
infrastructure was poor, depositors' confidence was weak, the quality and range of
banking products and services was limited, and financial intermediation was low.

The National Payments system was operated by the National Automated Clearing House
(NACH), an affiliate of the National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic (NBKR). The NACH,
which provided the clearing and pre-settlement of large and small payments, was
automated in 2003. However, the improved NACH did not support a standardized and
automated interface between banks and the settlement system, and there were no plans or
back-up facilities. It was also at full capacity and could not accommodate further
increases in volume and functions. These weaknesses impeded banks’ efforts to provide
affordable, convenient and reliable payment services. The few individual card systems
that existed in the country provided mostly debit cards services and the total number of
cards issued (less than 5,000) was low. There was no nationwide Automated Teller
Machine (ATM) network.

In regard to the state-owned banks, SSC was a narrow (non-lending) bank, with the
largest branch network. Through this network, SSC operated as a banking and payments
services delivery mechanism and provided fiscal and quasi-fiscal payments for the Social
Fund and other budgetary services for households. However, its operating costs were
high as it lacked modern facilities, systems and banking practices. Kairat Bank was
established in 1999 from the remains of three liquidated banks. Subsequently, in 2000, to
save the bank from collapse, the inherited bad loan portfolio was carved out, the bank

was recapitalized, its lending activities stopped, and a restructuring plan initiated. The
bank was generating profits at the time of appraisal and the authorities offered the bank
for privatization at the end of 2003. Support for this program was provided by both the
Japan Policy and Human Resource Development (PHRD) Grant and the Financial Sector
Reform and Strengthening (FIRST) Initiative.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

The objectives of the project were to assist the Borrower in (i) the implementation of the
national payments system modernization program and (ii) banking system reform,
narrowly defined as supporting the institutional strengthening of the Savings and
Settlement Company (SSC) and improving its efficiency in delivering banking and
payment services (see Section 1.6)2, according to the PAD. The PAD stressed that the
first aspect of the PDO was the primary objective of the project.

The key indicators from the PAD were as follows:

a) an increase in the number of bank accounts;
b) an increase in the volume of transactions channeled through the national payments
system; an increase in the total number of transactions processed through the bulk
clearing system;
c) an increase in the total number of cards;
d) an increase in the average monthly volume of transactions processed with bank cards
compatible with the shared system;
e) an increase in the total value of transactions processed through the RTGS;
f) an increase in SSC’s operating efficiency.

These indicators contributed to financial access objectives and promotion of judicious yet
broader use of financial services in Kyrgyzstan. In this context, the Payments System
component was the most significant pillar of the project with promise for on-the-ground
practical developmental results. It was also the key component in terms of impact, as
well as the costs envelope in the project, and the number of intermediate and final
outcomes measured.




2
  The above formulation of the Project Development Objectives (PDOs) is from the original Credit Agreement because
the Board was informed in the Project Paper dated February 17, 2009 that the correct formulation of the PDOs was the
one used in the Legal Agreement. The Project Paper stated that there was a discrepancy in the formulation (not the
intent) of the PDOs, as formulated in the Credit Agreement (Schedule 2) and in the PDO definition in the PAD and
clarified the fact that the observed discrepancy was of a semantic nature and did not reflect a divergence in the intended
objectives and scope of the Project. The PDO definition in the PAD did not refer to the banking sector reform objective
as the Legal Agreement did. This objective was secondary according to the PAD and narrowly defined as supporting
the strengthening of the SSC and improving its efficiency in delivering banking and payment services. The Board was
notified of the correct PDO in connection with the 2009 restructuring. It was triggered by an ECA-wide exercise to
remove any discrepancies in PDO formulations in 2009.

   1.3 Revised PDO

   In June 2012, the World Bank Board approved the revision of the PDO to reflect the
   cancellation of the Banking Sector Reform component, narrowly defined as supporting
   the strengthening of the SSC and improving its efficiency in delivering banking and
   payment services (see Section 1.6). The revised PDO was to “assist the Borrower in the
   implementation of the national payments system modernization program?. The Banking
   Sector Reform aspect of the PDO was removed as the implementation of the planned
   project activities was financed from other sources or would have been completed from
   other sources after the project closing date. The revised PDO represented more closely
   the outcome attributable to the project.

   The PDO, key indicators and expected outcomes were modified to (i) reflect the
   cancellation of the Banking Sector Reform component, the extension of the closing date
   to October 30, 2012, and the negative impact of difficult external circumstances on some
   targets; and (ii) to enhance the completeness of the result framework. Table 1 summarizes
   the changes in the PDO, outcome and intermediate indicators.

   1.4 Main Beneficiaries

   Project beneficiaries included a wide range of stakeholders. Citizens and residents using
   financial services were the primary target group of the project. A reliable and efficient
   payments system would substantially improve the quality and provision of services to
   businesses and households, increase confidence in the banking sector and hence help to
   deepen financial intermediation and stimulate private sector growth. The improved
   payments systems, both large and low value, would also provide appropriate tools to
   participating commercial banks to enhance the monitoring of their treasury operations
   and cash management, mitigate their credit and liquidity risks and reduce cash
   transactions.

   The direct project beneficiaries included the NBKR and SSC. The institutional and
   oversight capacity of the NBKR would be greatly strengthened and its monitoring of
   banking sector liquidity improved. Furthermore, building the institutional capacity and
   technological infrastructure of SSC would improve access to the population at large to
   banking services and financial intermediation though SSC’s extensive country-wide
   network. It would improve SSC’s outreach to the financially underserved rural
   populations.

   1.5 Original Components

   Originally, the project included three main components, one focusing on building
   Kyrgyz’s payments infrastructure, one for the enhancement of the general ledger of the
   NBKR, and a third aimed at building SSC’s institutional and operational capacity
   (defined as Banking Sector Reform).

   Component 1: Payments System Infrastructure (total cost: US$7.2 million)

           A) Bulk-clearing system (BCS): this included technical assistance for advisory
   services and establishment of a modern, fully automated bulk-clearing system. This was
   intended to enable commercial banks to process debit and credit orders for high
   volume/low-value transactions, including utility payments, salaries, pensions and other
   fiscal and quasi-fiscal payments, in a more secure, reliable and efficient manner.

          B) Inter-bank card system supported by a Card Processing Center (CPC): this
   included technical assistance for advisory services and establishment of a national inter-

                                                             14
bank card arrangement supported by a shared processing center. This subcomponent was
intended to coordinate and strengthen Kyrgyz commercial banks’ initiatives in card
activities, thus enabling bank customers to use any card accepted in the scheme in any
ATM or merchant’s equipment (Points of Sale (POS). This subcomponent also included
installation of a number of ATMs and POS equipment for improved access.

         C) Real-time gross settlement system (RTGS): this included technical assistance
for advisory services and establishment of an RTGS to provide timely settlement of
large-value or urgent inter-bank transactions. The RTGS was intended to enable banks to
settle their large-value transactions and those from credit transfers of major clients in a
more secure and timely fashion, thus eliminating paper-based recording, while providing
the NBKR with an accurate risk management tool to better monitor intra-day liquidity
positions and, exceptionally, overnight collateralized credit.

        D) Project management support for the payments infrastructure modernization
program: the NBKR was committed to completing a complex payments system within a
tight timeframe. The project was intended to provide project management support
services, including studies and the establishment of a monitoring and evaluation system.

Component 2: General ledger of the NBKR (total cost: US$1.6 million)

Component 2 aimed at financing a feasibility study, as well as advisory services and
investment costs to enhance and strengthen the NBKR's general ledger (GL) so that it
would become fully compatible and consistent with the requirements of the improved
payments system. It was intended to provide full automation and interface between the
RTGS and all components of the payments system and the NBKR.

Component 3: Banking sector reform (defined in the PAD as supporting the
strengthening of the SSC and improving its efficiency in delivering banking and
payment services) (total cost: US$1.6 million)

Component 3 aimed at implementing other areas of the Government’s banking sector
reform program to support the strengthening of the SSC, to improve its efficiency in
delivering banking and payment services and thus better fulfill the banking needs of its
customers. To this end, the project was meant to support (i) long term advisory services
for institutional and operational capacity building; (ii) specialized assistance to complete
an IT needs assessment and to implement the agreed recommendations, including the
provision of hardware and software for improving the bank’s information systems; and
(iii) international audits of SSC’s financial statements.

1.6 Revised Components

The Banking Sector Reform component was revised in a Level Two restructuring
approved by Bank management in March 2009 and a Level One restructuring approved
by the Board in June 2012. The first restructuring introduced some project support to
Component 3 (Banking sector Reform) for the privatization of Aiylbank (estimated costs
of SDR200,000) and other key activities to support the borrower’s banking sector reform

                                            15
    program. These funds were unused proceeds under the SSC component. The second
    restructuring cancelled SDR755,538.99 intended for Goods and Consultants Services to
    strengthen SSC operational and institutional capacity and support Aiylbank privatization
    under Component 3. This restructuring required Board approval because the partial
    cancellation of the Banking Sector Reform component affected the PDO. The changes
    and reasons are explained in Table 2 below.

                                              funds.


    1.7 Other significant changes

    Implementation schedule: The project was extended three times to ensure that, among
    other things, major activities would be completed, including late arriving ones requested
    by the Borrower and the development objective substantially achieved within a longer
    timeframe:
     In March 2009, Bank management approved the extension of the closing date of the
      project from October 31, 2008 to April 30, 2010 to allow adequate time for the

                                                             16
  successful implementation of the envisaged GL and to enable identified cost savings
  from other components to be used to expand the ATM and POS elements of the
  technical infrastructure, and thus provide an opportunity for government agencies and
  commercial banks to substantially decrease their dependency on cash usage through
  increased use of electronic payment instruments.
 In January 2010, Bank management approved the extension of the closing date of the
  project from April 30, 2010 to April 30, 2012. The extension was justified by (i)
  procurement delays due to unsuccessful bid for the GL that needed to be re-tendered,
  (ii) the complexity and large scope of the activities related to the SSC component,
  including the procurement and installation in all of its 50 branches and 60 outlets of a
  custom tailored Core Banking System that needed to upgrade the bank’s internal
  business management processes through better accounting, settlement, cash operation,
  and client account management systems; and (iii) the need of additional time to launch
  and monitor the privatization process of Aiylbank, through the recruitment of a
  qualified Privatization Transaction Advisor.
 In April 2012, the World Bank Board approved the extension of the closing date of the
  project from June 30, 2012 to October 31, 2012. The extension was justified by
  procurement delays caused by slow processing of a key IT procurement package and
  subsequent implementation delays of the GL component (Section 2.2).

Co-financing: In April 2007, the World Bank management approved a Borrower-
executed grant funded by Japan’s Population and Human Resources Development
(PHRD) grant in the amount of US$330,000 (TF056725) and effective in April 21, 2007.
The grant was used to support project preparation for the development of a modern
integrated national payments system in the Kyrgyz Republic, accepted and used by
commercial banks and their customers (government, business and individuals). The grant
financed project preparation activities and provided technical assistance to (i) assist the
CPC with the development of a strategy to promote the expansion of the national retail
payment card system, in the area of marketing policy, product line definition and pricing
policies as well as technical assistance to member banks on how to optimize earnings on
card transactions while keeping risks and expenses at a level acceptable to end-users; (ii)
support public information campaigns aimed at increasing awareness of the advantages of
using payment cards for retail transactions; and (iii) assist in the procurement of the GL
component for the development of bidding documents and evaluation of proposals. The
public awareness campaigns included workshops and seminars, as well as advertisements
on television, radio and publications of brochures.3 In June 2008, the closing date of the
grant was extended by 6 months from October 21, 2008 to April 21, 2009 because of the
re-advertisement of the GL project activities.

Cancellation: The June 2012 project restructuring also cancelled SDR702,378.86
intended for Goods and Consultants Services under Component 1 because of cost savings



3 A workshop on clearance system development was held at Ak-Keme Hotel (Bishkek) in 2008; 30,000 advertising
booklets on the national payment card (ElCart) were developed and published;10 advertising articles were published in
mass media; Short video materials on advantages of the national payment card (ElCart) were prepared and shown on
television for five months.

planned and an opportunity to contract high quality services at relatively low cost.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Soundness of the background analysis: The project was well prepared which helped
positively its implementation and outcome. Support for the preparatory work was
provided by the IMF as well as from resources from the PHRD Grant which assisted the
NBKR in the elaboration of a business plan, strategy and cost benefit analysis of a
payments system in the Kyrgyz Republic. The Grant also financed the preparation of a
launch workshop in September 2003 which focused on implementation, financial
management, procurement and technical matters. Feedback from the participants
indicated that procurement discussions were particularly useful and timely. Also, the
preparatory work undertaken with the assistance of the IMF to reform the legal
framework had an important impact on the sustainability of the project. In addition, the
project benefited from the experience in the preparation of payments system projects for
the West Africa Monetary Union (Credit 3424 of September 2000) and for Azerbaijan
(Credit 40300 of June 2005) as stated in the PAD.4 The project design and preparation
took into account some lessons learnt from these similar projects such as the fact that the
NBKR collaborated extensively with all expected stakeholders of the project (commercial
banks, utility companies, government agencies, bankers association, MoF, etc.) during
the preparation of the project.

Assessment of the project design: The project was rated Satisfactory by QAG.5 The
rating is in line with the ICR mission assessment. The modernization of the Payments
System Infrastructure component of the PDO was very clear, highly relevant and
essential to the development of the Kyrgyz banking system. As the largest and most
important component of the project, it was designed with a view to incorporating several
of the most critical functions of modern payment systems to cover retail, wholesale,
individual and business customers, to generate a working financial infrastructure that
would contribute to the financial sector access objectives of the economy. Other
components were a small fraction of the project and with hindsight, modernizing the GL
of the NBKR proved to be ambitious given the low appetite of qualified firms to
participate in biddings due to political instability, and given the various technical
elements of such a system that are lengthy to procure. In many projects, banking sector
reform is a very broad area of intervention, but in this project it was limited to one
institution, namely “to assist the Government in the banking sector reform by improving
SSC’s efficiency in delivering banking and payment services.? This aspect of the PDO

 See PAD p. 4 and p. 6.
5
 See QALP-1 report. A QAG assessment was undertaken in 2008. All the individual categories were rated Satisfactory
except Bank’s attention to technical, financial and economic aspects, the quality of results framework to achieve the
development objectives and the quality of arrangements for monitoring and evaluation.

                                                        18
was also relevant but the fact that it was so broad compared to the project intervention
was misleading and made assessment of results difficult.

Assessment of risks: The risks, mitigation measures and risk ratings were correctly
identified with a few exceptions. At the design stage, the risks identified centered mainly
on the potential lack of commitment and cooperation between the different stakeholders.
With hindsight, it appears that the project risks were accurately identified. The delays
experienced in the project were not linked to a lack of evaluation of the potential risks,
but rather to the unpredictable deterioration of the economic, political and social
environment. These risks materialized in 2005 with the political events of the Tulip
Revolution, and in 2010 during the Second Kyrgyz Revolution and the ousting of Kyrgyz
president Kurmanbek Bakiyev. 6 The latter prefaced ethnic tension across the country,
which led to significant financial sector instability. It proved to have a negative impact on
project implementation (see Section 1.3).

Adequacy of government’s commitment: The Kyrgyz government, through the NBKR,
and key stakeholders, was strongly committed to the project. The commitment was
demonstrated in (a) the 2003-2005 National Poverty Reduction Strategy (NPRS) 7
developed by the Government which included reforming the banking sector and
improvement of financial services and intermediation as an essential means for
stimulating private-sector led growth; (b) the State Action Program for 2003-2005 8
approved in 2002 by the President which involved the full backing of the Government in
introducing a non-cash payments system and establishing an infrastructure ensuring
effective execution of recurring payments (salaries, pensions, communal services and
taxes); (c) the Joint IDA-IMF Staff Advisory Note on the Poverty Reduction Strategy
(NPRS) Paper 9 for the period of 2007-2010 which reiterated the importance of a modern

6
   Kyrgyz Second Revolution: In the three years before April 2010 the president concentrated power in his
administrative apparatus, weakened the national assembly, and circumvented ministries. In April 2010, anti-
government demonstrations led to the overthrow of the government and the formation of an interim administration. In
June 2010, violent clashes took place over three days, particularly in the cities of Jalalabad and Osh. It was officially
reported that over 300 persons were killed, over 2500 were injured, and nearly 400,000 were temporarily displaced.
The disturbances also damaged infrastructure and destroyed private and public property. Economic activity was
disrupted, investment fell, trade was adversely affected, and the financial sector was severely stressed. The economy
contracted by 0.5 percent in 2010. Inflation rose to about 20 percent at the end of 2010 due to spikes in world food
prices, the current account went from a surplus in 2009 to a 6.9 percent deficit, and fiscal pressures emerged.

  The NPRS includes the Government’s strategy to reform the banking sector. It is built on the findings of the 2002

  Main Directions of Payment System Development for 2002-2005 were implemented in order to increase the share of
non-cash payments and the efficiency of the payment system, through creation of conditions for the development of
payment services and their availability for the payment services users. It was developed with extensive support from
the IMF.8http://www.nbkr.kg/index1.jsp?item=99&lang=ENG. It was developed with extensive support from the IMF.

  The strategy stressed the reform of the payment system which would facilitate development of new payment
mechanisms through banking accounts convenient for individuals and businesses. It was planned to develop an
infrastructure on acceptance and servicing payments with use of banking innovation services and technologies as well
as payment cards all over the territory of the republic for wire transfer of regular and budget payments, salaries through
commercial                              bank                              accounts.                           http://www-

banking innovation services and technologies as well as payment cards; and (d)
involvement and dialogue led by the NBKR which resulted in widespread support among
stakeholders.

2.2 Implementation

   (a) Factors outside the control of the government or implementing agencies

Some factors outside the control of the Borrower affected the project implementation and
outcomes.

Procurement delays: The procurement process took longer than estimated for the reasons
outlined below, delaying the installation and launching of IT systems:
    (i)    the bidding process of CPC was suspended after the second best bidder
           submitted an official complaint to the NBKR over what it claimed was an
           unfair bidding process. The reason for the complaint was technical and
           involved procurement procedures and bid evaluation. The World Bank reacted
           relatively quickly to address the complaint and found that there was no
           irregular activity relating to the procurement procedures followed by the
           NBKR based on the evidence available. The implementation of the CPC was
           delayed by several months (the bidding process started in February 2005 and
           was completed in November 2007);
    (ii)   the procurement of the General Ledger was extremely lengthy due to multiple
           consecutive unsuccessful bidding processes, the original underestimation of
           the cost allocated to the implementation of the GL at design, inadequate
           professional qualification of firms participated in the tender and the
           complexity of the configuration of the IT systems including the migration of
           old IT systems to updated ones. A new procurement process was launched in
           2009 with additional funds allocated out of savings from Component 1;
    (iii) the limited availability of specialized procurement specialist capacities within
           the World Bank slowed the processing of key IT packages.

Political events also caused delays: As explained in section 2.1, the political turmoil of
2005 and 2010 caused instability in the banking system. In 2010, the second revolution
led to the destruction of bank buildings, automated teller machines and payment
machines. Combined with persisting low standards of living and related factors that
deeply affected the banking system, this affected the ability to use and access bank cards.
Project implementation was slowed down while key stakeholders were more concerned
with maintaining their daily operations.

Extensive consultations with key stakeholders at entry: As discussed in 2.1, the project
was prepared with considerable input from stakeholders, especially during the 2003
launch workshop. During implementation, the consultative working groups developed
during preparation were maintained which permitted stakeholders to raise and resolve
issues.

                                            20
        (b) Factors generally subject to government control

The constant support of the Government contributed positively to project implementation.
The preparatory work undertaken with the assistance of the IMF to reform the legal
framework had an important impact on the sustainability of the project. Also, the
commitment was demonstrated during project implementation in (a) the amendments to
the Civil Code in 2006 to allow non-cash payments – credit and debit orders – for
individual bank accounts (these legal loopholes in the legal framework could have
undermined the implementation of different elements of the project, and in particular the
card system); (b) the review of the Resolution enacted in August 2006 by the
Government of the Kyrgyz Republic 10 to allow detailed and careful planning of the
closing of utility cash collection outlets; (c) the recognition of SSC’s efforts to improve
its operational efficiency and banking services delivery capacity in 2007 when it was
granted a universal license by the NBKR; and (d) NBKR’s own resources to complete the
implementation of the GL component.

The procurement process of the RTGS was delayed at the beginning of project
implementation by the lack of internal coordination between the Payments System
Department, the PIU and the IT Department. The issue was solved when coordination
arrangements were clearly defined under the leadership of the Chairman and the
appointment of a strong management team for the PIU. It contributed to expediting the
resolution of all remaining technical and procurement issues and improved the dialogue
with suppliers and consultants.

During project implementation the Government delayed the privatization of Aiylbank.
The small project allocation for Aiylbank was kept available for a couple of years
pending the Government’s action until it was cancelled from the project in June 2012.
After the closing date of the project, the Government cancelled the privatization of
Aiylbank. Although the advisory services for its privatization were a minor activity in the
project, the cancellation of the privatization was broadly speaking a significant set-back
to years of policy dialogue. The implication of this cancellation would negatively affect
the Government’s efforts to improve access to finance (mainly in the rural sector).

        (c) Factors generally subject to implementing agency control

The management of the NBKR, especially the Governor and Deputy Governor, gave the
program its full support 11 . Despite some early changes of PIU director in 2004, a
leadership vacuum and staffing issues related to the temporary suspension of the NBKR
Governor in 2005, the appointment of a solid project management team contributed to the


10
   According to the 2006 Resolution of the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic, all utility cash collection outlets had to
be closed by January 1st, 2007 and payments made via non-cash payment instruments. During the 2006 supervision
mission, the team stressed the lack of specific information as to how this decree should have been implemented among
the population and the commercial banks and warned that although it considered the Decree to have a commendable
objective, its implementation would have required detailed and careful planning, as the financial system, the population
and other stakeholders were not be ready to translate the intentions of the Decree into cost effective actions.
11   The Deputy Governor was also the project director.


                                                          21
acceleration of the project’s implementation from 2006. Given the complexity of the
procurement of large IT systems, the NBKR ensured that its staff receive adequate
training and nominate a back-up to the procurement specialist to support the PIU.


2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

M&E design: The project appraisal document contained a number of outcome and
component level indicators. The ICR mission noticed some short-comings in the original
results framework: (i) the main outcome indicators were too specific to evaluate the
impacts of all the three components of the project; (ii) the original results framework did
not include an outcome indicator to measure the results of the GL (see M&E
implementation); (iii) the Banking Sector Reform component was measured with very
specific indicators in the PAD but it was not reflected in the results framework, (iv) some
baseline data needed to be adjusted during project restructuring(s); and (v) one indicator
(“General ledger of the NBKR automated and integrated with the RTGS and BCS?) was
not measurable.

The key performance indicators for the three systems under component 1 (Payments
System Infrastructure), which was by far the largest piece of the project, were fully
measurable and reflected the expected results of this component.

M&E implementation: Significant efforts were undertaken during supervision to make
sure that data collection mechanisms were put in place to gather the relevant information
and ensure data quality. Data were collected and reported quarterly by the steering
committee, under the chairmanship of the NBKR. The last restructuring enhanced realism
of targets reflecting changed circumstances (for example, the interbank card system was
negatively affected by political instability), made the result framework more
comprehensive (the GL indicator was added) and finally revised the unit of measurement
based on available data for one indicator (the one measuring the use of BCC). Overall,
the restructuring helped assess ultimate results better based on updated performance
expectations.

M&E utilization: The M&E indicators were key in closely monitoring the progress and
reach of the payments system in strengthening the country’s financial infrastructure and
providing increased volume of access to payments and financial services. The indicators
were also key to decision making in particular when the project was restructured.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

There were no major fiduciary or safeguard issues nor any deviations or waivers from
Bank safeguards, fiduciary policies or procedures.

Financial Management was Satisfactory: The NBKR provided timely and reliable
information required for monitoring project implementation in line with World Bank
requirements. Quarterly financial monitoring reports, annual financial management

                                            22
supervision reports and annual audit reports were sent in a timely manner in a format and
with content acceptable to the World Bank.

Procurement is rated Satisfactory: The project required the procurement of four large
and complex information technology systems (BCS, CPC, RTGS and GL). The NBKR
had relatively low capacity at managing World Bank procurement and carried out the
procurement of the systems with some difficulties. One bid related to the acquisition of
the GL was re-bid twice because of a constrained budget and an inadequate procurement
method (single stage versus two- stage). The bidding of CPC was suspended for several
months after the second best bidder submitted an official complaint to the NBKR for
unfair bidding process. The bidding process to buy the RTGS system was suspended for
10 days after the World Bank received another complaint letter by a non-selected vendor.
The two complaints were handled adequately by the NBKR. Disbursements were slow
(there were no movements of funds between April 2009 and April 2011) compared to
initial planning because of procurement delays and political turmoil.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

In view of the cancelation of the Banking Sector Reform component and the political and
banking crisis that affected the Kyrgyz banking sector in 2010, the need for technical
assistance to support the strengthening of the banking sector had increased substantially.
The World Bank decided to respond by providing (i) dedicated technical assistance to the
NBKR through a larger FIRST-funded financial technical assistance grant; and (ii) a
US$7.15 million Financial Sector Development Project (FSDP) (P125689), approved by
the World Bank Board in March 2012 but until now Parliamentary opposition has
delayed effectiveness. 12

3. Assessment of Outcomes

In line with the assessment against the CPSS Core Principles for Systemically Important
Payment Systems (CPSIPS), of the BCS and the RTGS undertaken in August 2012 by a
World Bank expert from the Financial infrastructure practice, the ICR team estimates that
project achievements are highly commendable. 13 Modernizing the payment system
infrastructure was the main objective of the project according to the PAD and the largest
share of the project financing. The payment systems were put in place efficiently, as
demonstrated below. Most results indicators have exceeded significantly both their
original and revised targets. Also further benefits have been achieved such as with regard
to access to financial services (see Annex 2).



12
  The FSDP’s PDO are to (i) enhance financial sector stability, and (ii) increase access to financial services. The
signing has been delayed due to the opposition by one member in the Parliamentary Budget and Finance Committee to
the concept of Aiylbank’s privatization. The project is being restructured to cancel the support to Aiylbank to reflect
the fact that the privatization of Aiylbank has been cancelled.

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Original objectives, design and implementation assistance

The overall relevance of the original objective, its design and implementation assistance
is considered high because the payment system was highly relevant on all aspects and
because the shortcomings were related to the secondary PDO (sees Table 3). The
relevance of the revised PDO on all aspects is high.

The primary PDO: Implementation of the national payments system modernization
program: The main original objective, “to assist with implementation of the national
payments system modernization program?, its design and implementation are consistent
with current development priorities in the Kyrgyz Republic and with current Bank
country and sector assistance strategies to a high extent.

The focus of the original primary objective and its design reflected proper diagnosis of
Kyrgyz financial sector development priorities to further increase financial
intermediation and strengthen the banking sector, including introducing a non-cash
payments system and establishing infrastructure to ensure efficient payment execution
maintenance. The primary objective is also highly relevant for the country’s current
priorities. They are supported by (i) the World Bank’s Interim Strategy Note (ISN) FY12-
FY1314, of which improving access to finance is one of the key outcomes;15 and (ii) the
Country Medium Term Development Strategy for 2012-2014, which also includes
financial sector reforms as a key area, including reforms in bank resolution and prompt
remedial action framework, financial stability and access to finance. The PDO and design
also supported the preparation of the Financial Sector Development Project in Kyrgyz
Republic (P125689) that was designed to support the privatization of Aiylbank, increase
access to finance and develop the areas mentioned in the above country strategy.

The secondary PDO: Implementation of the banking system reform, narrowly
defined as support to strengthening the SSC to improve its operational efficiency:

                                                      24
The relevance of the secondary objective, its design and implementation assistance are
considered substantial based on the following reasons.
    The objective remains highly relevant for the Government, as stated in the
       Country Medium Term Development Strategy for 2012-2014. SSC’s rapid credit
       growth in the past two years has prompted the authorities to request the help from
       the IMF. A sales strategy was defined in 2012 under the IMF Three-Year
       Arrangement of the Extended Credit Facility to ensure that the majority of SSC’s
       shares are privatized over the medium-term.
    The design was initially relevant, but a larger part of its relevance changed to
       modest because (i) the planned advisory services for SSC were not needed as its
       operational efficiency improved based on its own efforts; (ii) the project’s
       planned IT upgrades for SSC were self-financed based on the Bank procurement
       documentation (see Section 1.6); and (iii) the privatization of Aiylbank was first
       postponed during the implementation of the project and eventually taken off the
       Government’s agenda for political reasons after the project closing date.
    The implementation assistance is considered highly relevant. The Bank responded
       appropriately to changed circumstances and restructured the project by cancelling
       the funds that remained unused because of the above reasons to meet the client’s
       needs and to strengthen the engagement of the client (see Section 1.6).

Revised objectives, design and implementation assistance

As explained above, the revised objective “to assist with implementation of the national
payments system modernization program? and its design are highly relevant for the
Kyrgyz financial sector development priorities and with the World Bank’s Interim
Strategy Note (ISN) FY12-FY13 and the Country Medium Term Development Strategy
for 2012-2014. The Bank’s implementation assistance remained highly relevant as the
Bank appropriately supported completing the final activities on a timely basis and closing
the project.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

The efficacy of the original project is high (see Table 4). The project modernized the
national payments system from manual processing of transactions in a highly cash-based
economy. The project contributed to increasing the operational efficiency of the SCC to a
modest extent but this does not undermine the overall high efficacy of the original project
because this aspect of the PDO was of secondary importance (and it was nevertheless
achieved). The project’s revised targets for modernizing the national payments system
were met overall to a high extent.

Primary PDO (original and revised): Assist the Borrower in the implementation of
the national payments system modernization program

Implementation of the national payments system modernization program. The
national payments system infrastructure was modernized and integrated with the project
financing, and its performance and use improved remarkably. Specifically, the
improvement of the national payments system facilitated the development of new
payment mechanisms through banking accounts convenient for individuals and
businesses. It also provided payment cards all over the territory for wire transfers of
regular and budget payments, and salaries through commercial bank accounts.

Critically, the payment systems component provided Kyrgyzstan with the requisite
“financial infrastructure? to broaden the reach, automaticity and electronic controls in
financial and economic transactions in the country. The reach of this key element of the
project has not only helped catapult Kyrgyzstan into a much more advance stage in the
state of its financial system but also provided a leap in the electronic retail and wholesale
transactions reflected in the increased bank access of the population.

In terms of risks, the automation and electronic processing via modern payment systems
actually reduce transaction risk and fraud and increase controls. Thus the expansion
evidence in the project does not imply any increase in financial sector risk. Typically,
                                               26
expansion of credit is associated more with potential risks or asset bubbles in the
financial system, but the payments system in itself is purely for enhancing the efficiency,
automation and access of non-cash transactions and bank accounts, thus providing the
essential financial infrastructure for residents, citizens and firms to be connected with the
financial system and exploit its efficiencies and economies of scale.

All original PDO indicators exceeded the original targets to a high extent: The total value
of transactions channeled through and processed by the national payments systems is
above the target value set originally and the total number of accounts has been multiplied
by more than five during the implementation of the project. The total value of
transactions channeled through and processed by the national payments systems remained
somewhat under the revised targets (it was most likely overestimated as there are no other
obvious factors that could have negatively affected the outcome).

? Bulk Clearing System (BCS): The BCS financed by the project constitutes the only
  clearing system in the Kyrgyz Republic, with 22 commercial bank participants
  connected to the NBKR using the Interbank Communication Network. The system,
  which was introduced in 2006 is also owned and operated by the NBKR. It has
  operated without interruptions since its startup, even during the 2010 political
  instability. The speed for clearing transactions between banks and the electronic
  system linking banks has been increased. Bank-to-bank transactions are cleared the
  day they are submitted for clearing. The World Bank assessment against the CPSS
  Core Principles for Systemically Important Payment Systems (CPSIPS) rated that the
  BCS "fully observed" one principle out of ten, "broadly observed" eight out of ten,
  and partly observed one out of ten. Participants generally have a good understanding
  of the rules of the BCS and the need to abide by them.

    The original and revised intermediate indicators were met: The total number of
    transactions or batches (as the new measurement unit) processed through the system
    has been multiplied by 3.3 and 3.5 above the project’s original and revised targets,
    respectively, during project implementation.

? Card Processing Center (CPC): The use of non-cash instruments in the Kyrgyz
  Republic has increased substantially during project implementation (see Annex 2),
  and the two revised intermediate targets were met. Som568,087 million transactions
  by about 369,0278 cards (for a total of more US$1.7 billion) were made between the
  start of operations of the system in 2006 and September 2012, which represented a
  132 percentage and 126 percentage achievement against the revised target,
  respectively. Out of 22, seventeen banks have been participating in card issue and 21
  banks have been connected to the CPC. New instruments, such as cash cards, have
  been introduced thanks to the introduction of national and international interbank
  card systems, which are facilitating doing business, paying taxes and utilities and
  receiving salaries.

    The original targets were not met because of the negative impact of unforeseen
    political circumstances, such as the 2010 revolution, which led to the destruction of

                                             27
   bank buildings, automated teller machines, payment machines, and due to overall
   persisting low standards of living and related factors that deeply affected the banking
   system and the ability to use and access bank cards. It should be noted, however, that
   the following two other indicators have shown the positive impact of a modern
   electronic card system: (i) since 2008, there has been an increase in the use of non-
   cash instruments with the share of currency in M1 declining from 89.9 percent in
   2008 to 84.4 percent in July 2012; and (ii) the total number of customers of deposit-
   taking institutions was multiplied by two between 2008 and 2011 from 6.4 percent to
   12.6 percent of the population (no direct impact but long-term impact).

? Real-Time Gross Settlement system (RTGS): Since 2008, the RTGS is fully
  operational with no significant operational failure. The BCS net obligations are
  settled in central bank money through the RTGS system, in line with international
  best practices. The RTGS has contributed to reducing settlement risk in securities
  transactions by facilitating the delivery versus payment (DVP) mechanism. In this
  context, the setting up of the Payment Systems Department is in itself a positive
  achievement which ensures the availability of resources to pay undivided attention to
  payment systems issues and in particular the oversight function. Also, the
  development of an RTGS system in the Kyrgyz Republic has dramatically reduced
  settlement and systemic risks on the interbank settlement process. This is made
  possible by effecting final settlement of individual funds transfers on a continuous
  basis during the processing day. The credit risk in the RTGS system is significantly
  reduced by the requirement for an account to be adequately funded before a
  transaction can be processed. In 2012, the NBKR conducted a self-assessment, as
  part of its payment system oversight responsibilities. The World Bank assessment
  against the CPSS Core Principles for Systemically Important Payment Systems
  (CPSIPS) rated the RTGS system "observed" for three principles out of ten, "broadly
  observed" for five out of ten, and partly observed for one out of ten (while one
  principle is not applicable). Participants generally have a good understanding of the
  rules and the need to abide by the RTGS.

   The implementation of the RTGS has highly exceeded its original target: The annual
   value of individual transactions has been multiplied by four compared to the original
   target. RTGS captures 88.8 percent of interbank transactions. It has been reported
   that an average 416 payment operations are performed per day under the RTGS,
   representing an average daily amount of Som2.1 billion (US$0.45 min). Swifter
   funds transfers between banks in order to manage their settlement positions with
   other banks or with the NBKR have significantly improved the management of
   liquidity and reserves while reducing systemic risks. The revised target for total value
   of individual transactions fell slightly short (it was most likely overestimated as there
   are no other obvious factors that could have negatively affected the outcome), but the
   ultimate objective of settling transactions in a more secure, timely and efficient
   manner, as described above, demonstrates the full achievement of the objective.




                                            28
Overall, participating commercial banks have consolidated their accounts in the NBKR
into a single settlement account, which has improved the NBKR’s knowledge of and
control over the liquidity position of banks.

General Ledger. The full automation of the GL (Component 2) was completed with
some delay in January 2013 when the GL went live (see Section 2.2). It provided an
interface between the GL and the RTGS. Commercial banks’ opening and closing
balances are now transferred to the RTGS at the beginning and at the end of the day. The
closing balances are reflected in the daily balance sheet of the NBKR. The new GL has
allowed the NBKR to integrate and adapt its accounting, treasury and financial
information systems to accommodate the increased flows and volume generated by the
improved payments system infrastructure.

Secondary PDO: Assist the Borrower with implementation of the banking sector
reform, narrowly defined as support to strengthening the SSC to improve its
operational efficiency (according to the PAD)

As discussed earlier, the project was to assist the Government in banking sector reform
by improving SSC’s operational efficiency in delivering banking and payment services.
According to the PAD, it was a high priority for the Government, but a secondary project
objective. In the end, the project contributed modestly to improving SSC’s operational
efficiency in delivering banking and payment services. Of the original activities, the
project only financed SSC’s international financial audits. The procurement of SSC’s
information systems upgrade was in progress for several years due to unsuccessful re-
bids but, due to the project’s closure, it was implemented by SSC based on
documentation prepared under the project. The technical assistance portion to enhance its
institutional and operational capacity was canceled in June 2012 (see Section 1.7). With
regards to Aiylbank, due to the political developments and turmoil in the Kyrgyz
Republic, its privatization was first postponed during project implementation and
eventually cancelled after the project closure for political reasons (see section 2.2).

Although most outputs were not financed by the project, the original target for
operational efficiency of SSC was exceeded based on improvements financed by SSC:
the operating efficiency of SCC defined as % of total operating expenses to total deposits
in the result framework decreased from 28 percent in 2003 to 8.6 percent in 2012. SSC’s
efforts to improve its operational efficiency and banking services delivery capacity were
recognized in 2007 when it was granted a universal license by NBKR. Also, in 2012, the
Kyrgyz government developed a sales strategy for SSC with the assistance of the IMF, to
ensure that the majority of SSC’s shares are privatized over the medium-term. The
strategy is expected to be voted on by the Parliament in 2013.16


 16
   The Kyrgyz authorities developed a sales strategy for SSC according to the letter of intent sent to the IMF Managing
Director by the Kyrgyz government in April 2012. The letter was included into the Second Review under the Three-
Year Arrangement of the Extended Credit Facility and Request for Modification of Performance Criteria released by
the IMF on May 15, 2012. The Kyrgyz government planned to extend Som1.5 billion in 2012 through SSC and the
other state-owned banks for government supported programs (Som0.6 billion has already been on-lent through these
banks). Large capital injections by the government into SSC, which already experienced more than three-fold asset

3.3 Efficiency

The project is cost-effective: The PAD did not include quantitative cost benefit analysis.
As usual in this type of project, the economic benefits were described in qualitative terms.
The efficiency of the project in achieving its objectives is difficult to estimate precisely
but, from a cost effectiveness perspective, this project delivered more efficient, safer and
cheaper technologies as well as upgraded IT systems that have reduced the cost of
manual processes of using cash for transactions, in particular for the payment of salaries,
pensions and utilities services. As noted in Table 5 above, the percentage achievements
of each target under the original and revised outcome indicators reflect financial
transaction cost savings as well as financial earnings by customers, savers and banks that
will more than offset the overall costs of the project in the medium and long terms. The
extensions totaling 4.5 years brought some additional benefits: (i) lower costs of key
payments systems and IT packages; and (ii) an upgrade of IT systems not planned at
design but necessary to the modernization of the GL. The funds to improve SSC’s
operational efficiency were not used for several years due to unsuccessful re-bids for the
information systems upgrade and due to project’s closure, and it was implemented by
SSC based of documentation prepared under the project. Overall, it could be said that
both the original and revised project benefits were substantial compared to the value of
project investment in capacity and infrastructure improvements.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory

The objectives were achieved to a satisfactory extent based on a weighted average of the
ratings of the original PDO and the revised PDO, as shown in Table 7. The “satisfactory?
original outcomes are based on high relevance, high efficacy and substantial efficiency.
The “satisfactory? revised outcomes are based on high relevance, high efficacy and
substantial efficiency. Although the relevance and efficacy of the banking sector reform
aspect of the original PDO, narrowly defined as support to strengthening the SSC to
improve its operational efficiency, were modest, this does not undermine the overall high
relevance and efficacy of the original PDO because this aspect was of secondary
importance for the project.



growth during the last two years, would allow the bank to resume its rapid expansion. The authorities committed to
limit capital injections into SSC to Som250 million in 2012 with a view to containing SSC's growth. NBKR has been
closely monitoring SSC's financial indicators, which have so far not suggested any worrisome trends. A preliminary
assessment of the strategy indicated that follow-up work is needed to further reduce the government's involvement in
SSC.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

As explained earlier, the project was not primarily focused on poverty issues although
efficient, affordable and safer access to a wide range of automated financial services
offered by the commercial banks will help the underserved and disconnected populations
in the long term. Several parameters suggest that these ambitions were met, at least in
part. Between 2004 and 2011 the number of ATMs in the country increased from 21 to
460, or a growth from 0.6 and 0.1 ATMs per adult and per 1,000 KM2 respectively to
12.1 and 2.4 respectively. The number of commercial bank branches per 100,000 adults
also rose from 5.1 to 7.3, or from 0.9 to 1.4 branches per 1,000 KM2.17 In 2012, the team
measured the gender disaggregation of bank account ownership and found it relatively
significant.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

The project has had a positive impact on strengthening the institutional capacity of the
NBKR. A new banking clearing department for payments systems (for RTGS and retail
payments) was created. A division of this department is in charge of the oversight of the
payments system. The capacity of the NBKR staff has been enhanced and there are
currently 16 staff in the payment systems department, of which 6 staff member are in
charge of analyzing, monitoring and supervision of payments systems.

particularly in the case of smaller local financial institutions which had to update their
information technology to be able to participate in the system.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

The risk that the outcomes will not be maintained is moderate. The PDOs have been met.
The BCS, RTGS and General Ledger have become part of the NBKR’s functions and
oversight. The NBKR has been able to process all payment transactions in a secured way.
It shows the NBKR’s strong ownership. The continuous upgrading of the IT systems (for
both NBLR and the commercial banks), with the development of new technology, poses
a risk of sustainability to the overall system, but it is mitigated by the fact that all banks
have already planned IT upgrades in their operational strategies.

The project also helped introduce a national inter-bank card system with international
standards which did not exist. 17 banks out of 22 have been participating in the CPC and
the remaining 4 banks, mostly large international banks, have been only accepting
national system cards in their peripheral devices. The national card system and CPC
should be further enhanced.

Also, the assessment of the BCS and the RTGS against the CPSS Core Principles for
Systemically Important Payment Systems 18 concluded that there is still room for
improvements for Kyrgyz payments systems such as i) improved liquidity management
and monitoring; ii) introduction of DVP in the settlement of securities; and, iii) improved
operational risk management through hardware support to fully ensure business
continuity. Also, improving interoperability of the ATM and POS networks would lead to
an increase in the use and efficiency of electronic payment instruments.

Finally, there are some uncertainties related to maintaining the outcomes related to SSC.
While the Parliament is expected to vote on the sales strategy of SSC in 2013 to ensure
that the majority of its shares are privatized over the medium term, there are some
political uncertainties related to its outcome (similar to the ones that cancelled the
privatization of Aiylbank).


18
  The CPSS-IOSCO has issued the new “Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures" (PFMIs). Systemically
important payment systems in Kyrgyz Republic will have to be assessed against these new standards to determine
compliance.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory

The rating reflects (a) the strategic relevance and appropriateness of the objective for the
Borrower and the World Bank in line with the QAG report; 19 (b) the adequacy of project
design and all major relevant aspects taken during preparation and appraisal such as
technical, financial, economic, institutional, fiduciary and social; (c) clearly defined
institutional and implementation arrangements as well as M&E arrangements; and d) the
extensive involvement of key stakeholders in all aspects of the preparation of the project.
It also reflects some short-comings: (a) the project did not initially provide an efficient
solution to address the lack of strategy related to SSC and the banking sector component;
(b) the under-estimated cost and time required to procure and implement all the systems
(BCS, CPC, RTGS and GL); and (c) broad designation of the Banking Sector Reform
component of the PDO which made the results difficult to assess (although it was initially
possibly meant to provide flexibility).

Overall, the project was technically sound and addressed the needs of NBKR,
commercial banks and other stakeholders. Project components were designed to reflect
best international principles and standards as well as local realities. In addition, major
risk factors and lessons learned from other related projects in implementing payment
systems infrastructure were considered and incorporated into the project design.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The rating reflects (a) frequent supervision and the intense efforts of TTLs for in-field
follow-up and electronic communication following 2008 QAG’s recommendation; (b)
adequate use of performance indicators after the 2009 and 2012 project restructurings,
while considering that the last restructuring could not have a significant impact on M&E
results given the disbursement rate by then; (c) proactive team efforts in restructuring the
project which shows flexibility in responding to client needs as the extensions allowed
NBKR to complete the implementation of the revised project activities in full compliance
with the fiduciary requirements and in accordance with loan agreements; and (d) the
presence of a locally based financial sector specialist (ETC/STC) that strengthened
supervision between missions (since 2007).

 The ICR team concurs with QAG in their rating of the Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry. The project
was strategically relevant and its design and approach were appropriate for the country’s track record and capacity.




                                                        33
There were a few shortcomings in project supervision such as the limited availability of
IT procurement resources in the country and slow procurement reviews in case of key IT
packages, particularly at the beginning of the project.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The assessment of the overall Bank performance is based mainly on (a) the successful
implementation of a strategically important and technically complex project by a client
with low capacity; (b) initial shortcomings in the design, and (c) insufficient IT
procurement resources.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

The rating is supported by (a) the NBKR’s high level of commitment to the objectives
and design, as demonstrated by continuous support and approval of legal framework
(legal loopholes found in 2006) and close involvement with SSC and Aiylbank activities;
(b) high involvement of the Working Groups comprised of the NBKR, SSC and Aiylbank
with project design and implementation; and (c) additional financing in the project
implementation by the NBKR for the completion of the automation of the GL.

Several shortcomings which affected the implementation negatively included (a) a
leadership vacuum and lack of coordination by the suspension of the Chairman of the
NBKR who was on house arrest in 2005 and 2006 and which created some frictions and
disagreements between the PIU and the Payments System Department in 2005 and 2006;
(b) fraud allegations resulting in an internal investigation on the evident leak of
information in connection to the RTGS contract delayed the procurement of the contract
by several months. Eventually, coordination improved with the restructuring of the PIU.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

The performance of the implementing agency – PIU – was satisfactory. The PIU was
established in the Directorate on Investments and Technical Assistance Coordination
(DITAC) within the NBKR. The PIU managed and coordinated project implementation,
including financial management, procurement and disbursement. The PIU also complied
with fiduciary requirements and ensured close coordination with SSC and Aiylbank and
with other commercial banks. The PIU’s staff was responsive and dedicated throughout
the life of the project. 20 The procurement staff performance was particularly good
considering the complexity of the design and procurement packages, mainly after 2009.
Yearly financial management supervision reports confirmed the existence of satisfactory
financial management arrangements.

20
     In 2004, the director of the PIU was quickly replaced by DITAC’s Chief economist.

                                                          34
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

The overall outcome is Satisfactory based on the NBKR’s satisfactory performance and
the PIU’s satisfactory performance.

6. Lessons Learned

Payments systems are technically complex and can take more time than planned to
implement, especially in low capacity and politically and economically unstable IDA
countries. The project required Bank and Government teams with specialized skills.
Because of the technical documentation and lengthy procurement processes required of
such systems and financial infrastructure, it usually takes more time to implement than
expected. Payment system projects should take their complex nature into consideration in
allocating resources and designing implementation plans.
The restructuring of the project gave the opportunity to show the Bank’s and the
NBKR’s flexibility and pro-activity in resolving implementation issues, though such
instruments can be over-utilized. The 2009 and 2012 restructuring of the project gave a
momentum to the project to get back on track. Specifically, the 2012 restructuring of the
project allowed more time and focus on the GL implementation issues, and reinforced
stakeholders’ ownership. However, the final restructuring near project closing, while
attempting to adjust all indicators to the final state of the project accurately, did not
provide maximum value given the already high disbursement rate at that point.

The capacity of procurement and financial management should be in place before
the start of the project. This is particularly important for technically complex projects
with extended bidding documentation, which takes a long time to prepare and review.
Also, there was a lack of sufficient IT capacity at the World Bank, the NBKR and the
PIU which caused early delays in the procuring of the BSC and the RTGS. It is worth
noting that the selection of a reputable vendor and proven systems are crucial for
systematically important payments systems (RTGS).

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

As mentioned in the body of this ICR report, the efficiency of the project in achieving its
objectives is difficult to estimate with exacting precision, but from a cost effectiveness
perspective, the project was a major achievement due to more efficient and cheaper
technologies as well as the upgrade of IT systems. The project reached its primary
objectives of implementing the national payments system modernization program. As
noted in Table 3 in the report, the percentage achievements of each target under the
original and revised development objectives, indicators and outcomes, reflect financial
transaction cost savings as well as financial earning by customer/savers and banks,
respectively, that will more than offset in the medium and long term, the overall costs of
the project.
