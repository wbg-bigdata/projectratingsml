A. SUMMARY

1.     The proposed restructuring would cancel savings and certain project activities due
to changed circumstances and, consequently, amend the Project Development Objectives
and the results framework. Specifically, the changes include firstly, cancellation of SDR
1,457,917.85 that consists of savings under the Goods Category available for the
Payment System Modernization, General Ledger System and Project Implementation
Components and the remaining funds for Savings and Settlement Corporation (SSC),
Aiylbank and modernization of the banking sector activities under the Banking Sector
Reform component. The latter project activities are being financed from other sources or
will be completed after the closing date from other sources. Secondly, the changes
include adjustment of the PDO to reflect the cancellation by removing “banking sector
reform? from the Project Development Objectives (PDOs). Thirdly, the changes comprise
amendment of the result framework to reflect the cancellation, the extension of the
closing date approved on April 26, 2012, negative impact of difficult external
circumstances on some targets or to otherwise enhance the completeness of the result
framework.

B. PROJECT STATUS

2.      The project has substantially achieved its main objective of developing a modern
integrated national payment system that is accepted and used by the commercial banks
and their clients. The project financed the implementation of three systems and all the
planned outputs under Part A (Payment System Modernization). The Bulk Clearing
System (BCS) was introduced in October 2006; the new Real Time Gross Settlement
(RTGS) System was introduced in June 2008, and the Inter-Bank Card Processing Center
(CPC) has been operational since December 2006. The project has exceeded its end-of-
project targets for the PDO indicators - the value of transactions channeled through and
processed by the national payments system and the number of bank accounts. In addition,
the project has exceeded component level indicators for the total value of individual
transactions processed through the RTGS, the total number of transactions processed
through the BCS1 and operating efficiency of the SSC. However, the number/volume of
card transactions measured as part of the project’s component level indicators are under
target due to general economic conditions, persisting low standards of living, political

1
  In the Implementation Status Report the current data is provided in number of batches although the original indicator
and target measure individual transactions. The definition is proposed to be revised to make the unit of measure
consistent with the data being provided by NBKR. The target for total number of transactions in BCS (20,000,000 per
year) was in fact met. If BCS users sent their retail transactions to the BCS as individual payments, the total number of
transactions (according to NBKR calculations) would be 25,200,000 per year (much higher than the original target).

instability and related factors that deeply affected the banking system and the ability to
use and access bank cards. The PDOs and Implementation Progress are thus rated
Moderately Satisfactory in the last Implementation Status Report.

3.      The overall disbursement level for the project is low (68%) due to long-term
delays with procurement of the General Ledger for the National Bank of the Kyrgyz
Republic (NBKR) under Part B (General Ledger System) ($2.05 million), availability
of savings under Parts A and D and delayed completion of project activities for SSC and
Aiylbank beyond the project closing date due to procurement delays and political
instability, respectively (see paragraphs 5-7). On April 26, 2012 the closing date was
extended until October 30, 2012 to allow completion of the General Ledger contract – the
last project activity. All other project activities under Parts A and B have been completed,
and the remaining costs savings are proposed to be cancelled (see Section C).

C. PROPOSED CHANGES

4.       Project’s Development Objectives: The PDOs are changed to reflect the
cancellation of the Banking Sector Reform component from “assisting the Borrower in
the implementation of the national payments system modernization program and banking
system reform? to “assisting the Borrower in the implementation of the national
payments system modernization program.? The PDO aspect related to the banking sector
reform is being removed because the implementation of the planned project activities that
are described in paragraphs 7-9 are being or will be financed from other sources. These
activities fall under Part C.2. under the Banking Sector Reform component. The revised
PDO represents closer the outcome attributable to the project.

5.      Results/indicators: Several changes will be made in the result framework (see
Annex 1) to reflect the cancellation, the extension of the closing date approved on April
26, 2012, negative impact of difficult external circumstances on some targets or to
otherwise enhance the completeness of the result framework. Specifically, (a) the
indicator for SSC is dropped because the related activities are financed outside the
project; (b) one new PDO and component indicator is introduced for Part B (General
Ledger System) as no indicator was selected at appraisal; (c) the unit of measure for the
indicator of the BCS is changed from “total number of individual transactions processed
through the system? to “total number of batches processed through the system? so that it
could be measured as the NBKR does not have available data on the former; (d) the end-
of-project targets are updated as of October 30, 2012 based on the extension approved on
April 26, 2012 except for the Inter-Bank Card System (Part A.2); and (e) the targets for
Part A.2 are retrospectively reduced due to negative impact of unforeseen political
circumstances; particularly, the revolution of 2010, which led to destruction of bank
buildings, automated teller machines, payment machines, and due to overall persisting
low standards of living and related factors that deeply affected the banking system and
the ability to use and access bank cards. Finally, an indicator “direct number of project
beneficiaries (number) of which female (%)? is introduced to the result framework to
meet the corporate requirement for reporting on project beneficiaries (which, in this case,
are understood as bank account holders).


                                             8
6.       Components: Part C (Banking System) is amended by cancelling Part C.2
because the consultant services and goods for strengthening SSC’s operational and
institutional capacity, privatization of Aiylbank and the overall banking sector needs are
financed outside the project according to a timetable that goes beyond the closing date of
the project (see paragraphs 7-9).

7.       While the main PDO was the development of a modern integrated national
payment system, the original small “Banking Sector Reform? component, although
defined very broadly, was aimed at building institutional capacity and technological
infrastructure of SSC to improve its efficiency and service delivery, and financing
international audits.2 This was to improve access of the population at large to banking
services and financial intermediation through SSC’s extensive country-wide network. As
the project financing was not needed for SSC’s institutional development to meet the
institutional development objectives,3 the component was restructured in 2009 to make
these funds available to privatization of Aiylbank and allow the project financing for
overall technical assistance needs to modernize the banking sector.4 In addition, the SSC
was planning to purchase a new Core Banking System with project financing to upgrade
its internal business management processes and continue to finance international audits
under the project, as planned.

8.      With regards to SSC, the project financed only audits of financial statements for
SSC. Two attempts to acquire the Core Banking System for SSC were conducted under
Bank support in accordance with World Bank procurement procedures. Unfortunately,
both efforts failed.5 SSC has thus now undertaken a third attempt – currently ongoing – to
procure a new Core Banking System. These efforts are being undertaken without the
project funding so as not to be limited by time constraints (given credit closure), although
using slightly modified Bank bidding documents.

9.      With regards to Aiylbank, due to the political developments and turmoil in the
Kyrgyz Republic, its privatization has been postponed and is expected to be supported
under another World Bank-financed project (the Financial Sector Development Project,
IDA operation P125689), approved by the Board on March 8, 2012. With regards to the
overall banking sector needs, in view of the banking crisis that affected the Kyrgyz
banking sector in 2010, the need for technical assistance to support the strengthening of
the banking sector increased substantially. The Bank decided to respond by providing
dedicated technical assistance to the NBKR through a larger FIRST-funded6 financial

  It is noted that the PDO and component title referred to overall banking sector reform, but the legal agreement
provided for financing only for SSC.
3
  Even though the project did not finance consultant services for SSC’s institutional development, SSC’s own efforts to
improve its operational efficiency and banking services delivery capacity were recognized in 2007 when it was granted
a universal license by the National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic (NBKR). These self-financed improvements also
enabled the SSC to fulfill and even exceed its internal operational efficiency performance target established at
appraisal.
4
  The project financing for Aiylbank was SDR 200,000 under Expenditure Category 2-C. The project financing for
overall banking sector reform was going to be minor, if it materialized, and dependent on a reallocation that was to be
made during the project implementation.
5
  The reasons were substantially higher bid prices than the existing budget and failed negotiations.

10.      Financing:
         o Project Costs will be revised, as shown below. The revisions reflect
            cancellation of Credit proceeds due to cancellation of activities under Part C.2
            (paragraphs 5-7) and savings under Part A and D. As mentioned, all planned
            outputs have been implemented under Part A and B or, in case of Part B, will
            be completed by the closing date. Savings under Part A were made possible
            by high competition and an opportunity to contract high quality services at
            relatively low cost. However, in the case of the General Ledger under Part B,
            in spite of the relatively large number of bidders, bid prices turned out to be
            much higher than the project allocation (this led to re-tenders twice). In the
            last successful tender for the General Ledger, NBKR decided to co-finance the
            contract in the amount of over $1 million.

D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY

11.    There are no changes to the social and environmental analysis and no exceptions
to Bank Policy are required.

12.      The economic and financial analysis made at appraisal focused on the benefits
that an efficient payment infrastructure – the main PDO – would yield. The benefits from
the modernized payment system infrastructure remain valid; all outputs under Parts A and
B have been or will be implemented (in case of Part B) by the closing date. With regards
to the benefits resulting from the planned project activities for SSC, the project aimed to
improve its efficiency in delivering banking and payment services (% of total operating
costs of total deposits). Although most project activities for SSC except for international
audits are cancelled under the project due to delays and availability of other financing to
complete them, SSC’s own efforts enabled it to fulfill and even exceed its internal
operational efficiency performance target established at appraisal. Thus, not supporting
the planned (marginal in size) banking sector elements under the project financing does
not question the economic rationale and justification of the project and the justification at
appraisal remains fully valid. With regards to the overall banking sector needs, the Bank
has provided dedicated technical assistance to the NBKR through a financial sector
technical assistance grant followed by the above Financial Sector Development Project to
meet the overall banking sector reform needs (paragraph 7). Finally, in spite of the
reduction of targets for the Inter-Bank Card System (Part A.2), the overall cost/benefit
analysis is showing that benefits are expected to be high. This is based on the assumption
that all planned outputs and investment were financed by the project. Additional positive
effects will be achieved over time since the payments infrastructure elements that were
set up under the Project will allow banks to introduce new bank products and services,
