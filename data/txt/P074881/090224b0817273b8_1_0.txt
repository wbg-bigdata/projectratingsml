                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Substantial progress in implementing the project has been achieved in all components related to the modernization of the national Kyrgyz payments system infrastructure. The Bulk
                         Clearing System (BCS) introduced in October 2006 to support small and medium value size payments in the economy continues to operate well. The new Real Time Gross
                         Settlement (RTGS) System introduced in June 2008 to support large value payments already led to a decrease in the operating cost of the National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic

                         (NBKR) which was passed on to users through a decrease in transaction costs. The adoption of the new RTGS system positively impacted the Kyrgyz economy by stimulating a
                         substantial increase in its payment system turnover. The total value of transactions channeled through and processed by the national payment systems is twice the target value set
                         originally, and the number of bank accounts has been multiplied by more than five between 2004 and 2012. As planned, the speed of clearing credit orders, direct debit and card
                         transactions is now almost instant from bank-to bank. New instruments, such as cash cards, have been introduced thanks to the introduction of an interbank card system, which are

                         facilitating doing business, paying taxes and utilities and receiving salaries. The inter-bank Card Processing Center (CPC) has been operational since December 2006 and usage of
                         the national El-Card continues to grow steadily albeit slowly. Another important planned application, the Government payroll reform initiative whereby Government employees’
                         salaries are paid through bank accounts instead of cash, also continues to grow with approximately 72,000 employees as of end June 2012 receiving direct deposits of their salaries
                         through commercial bank accounts. The volume of individuals’ deposit has also experienced steady growth with at an accelerated growth rate since 2007 of 75% per annum. The
                         tender for the General Ledger of the NBKR has also been completed successfully with contract implementation launched in September 2011. Due to the recent political developments
                         and turmoil in the Kyrgyz Republic, the planned privatization of the Aiylbank was however postponed and will be supported under the new Financial Sector Development operation
                         approved by the Board in March of 2012. Finally, given the limited time left under the Project, the large state-owned bank SSC (Settlement and Savings Company) opted to acquire
                         its new core banking system independently so as not to be bound by restrictive time limits while using the detailed specifications and bidding documents developed under PBSM. The
                         Project was also extended until October 31, 2012 and restructured to allow for full completion of the ongoing General Ledger contract and cancel remaining credit amounts unlikely to
                         be utilized.
