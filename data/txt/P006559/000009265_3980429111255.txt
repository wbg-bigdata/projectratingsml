Block 1: Project Description
1. Project Development Objectives: (see Annex 1 for key performance indicators)
*    The proposed project, the first part of a two-part program, is designed with the following development objectives: (a) to
finance infrastructure and equipment which are critical to the physical integration between the two existing rail
suburban systems (ex-CBTU and ex-FEPASA) and between them and the Sao Paulo subway system (METRO); (b)
to improve the level-of-service provided by CPTM by enhancing the participation of the private sector in its
management and operations; and (c) to contribute towards the reduction of noise and pollution from transport
sources.
•    Specifically, the proposed project would integrate about 270 km of suburban main line tracks by building rail links to
allow trains from ex-CBTU's Leste lines. access to ex-FEPASA's lines at the Barra Funda intermodal station. East-
west bound passengers would then be able to transfer between the suburban rail systems of FEPASA and CBTU,
connect with the north-south Metro line at the intermediate station of Luz, and have access to the Sao Paulo central
business district. The proposed project will also finance technical assistance to support the process to concession out
CPTM's operations and maintenance to the private sector. Finally, the proposed project will include a number of
actions designed to contribute to the improvement of air quality in the SPMR.
*    The second  part of the program, which is under preparation  in parallel as a separate loan, will consist of the
construction of a 9.63-km subway line (the Metro's 4th line) possibly under a Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) scheme.
This line will further contribute to the physical integration of the rail-based systems in the SPMR, increasing
considerably the attractiveness of this mode due to its geographical coverage. This second part will be jointly
financed by the State of Sao Paulo, the World Bank, JEXIM (or BNDES) and the private sector (50%). It is being
prepared jointly by the Bank and IFC, which has been retained as the financial advisor.

3. Benefits and Target Population:
Beneficiaries are the residents of the Sao Paulo Metropolitan Region, particularly low-income households (eaming up to three
minimum salaries) who are major users of public transport. The Govemment of the State of SSo Paulo will also benefit from
the concession of the CPTM system to the private sector because it will eliminate the subsidies which it pays to that operating
agency.

4. Institutional and Implementation Arrangements:
The overall coordination and supervision of the proposed project rests with the SAo Paulo Secretariat for Metropolitan
Transport (STMSP), which has established a Project Coordination Unit (PCU) for the Sao Paulo Integrated Urban Transport
Program. The Sao Paulo Metropolitan Train Company (CPTM) will be the implementing agency and will also have its own
Project Implementation Unit.

Block 2: Project Rationale
5. CAS Objective(s) Supported by the Project:             Document number and date of latest CAS discussion:
Report No. 16582-BR, June 12, 1997
The Bank's Country Assistance Strategy for Brazil, discussed by the Board on June 12, 1997, is to support policies and
investments that will encourage economic growth and social development in a context of macroeconomic stability. The
emphasis is on efficient resource allocation, increased efficiency in the public sector, appropriate targeting and delivery of
support systems to the poor; and improving the creditworthiness of the Brazilian states. The proposed project is fully
consistent with this assistance strategy since it is designed to: (a) promote reforms and financial viability of public
enterprises, including concessions or sale of state-owned urban transport agencies to the private sector; (b) increase the
efficiency of infrastructure investments; and (c) contribute to poverty alleviation. The proposed project is a follow-up to the
federally-financed Sao Paulo Metropolitan Transport Decentralization Project (Ln. 3457-BR), which transferred the CBTU
rail system from the Federal to the State Government, led to the establishment of CPTM, and financed a study to
concession out the CPTM system to the private sector. The proposed project finances a rail link which connects the
western and eastern networks of CPTM, thereby enhancing rail movements in the east-west direction.

6. Main Sector Issues and Government Strategy:
A number of key issues must be addressed in order to improve the supply of urban transport services and to guarantee their
orderly development and sustainability in the long term for the SPMR. They are: (a) institutional issues; (b) cost recovery and
financial management issues; (c) environmental issues; and (d) transport planning issues.
*  Institutional Issues. The most critical institutional issues are: (a) the fine-tuning of relations between state and municipal
governments and a clear definition of their respective roles in the financing, planning and operation of urban transport
services in accordance with the 1988 Constitution; and (b) the appropriate modification of regulations, including the
elimination of regulatory barriers which might prevent free entry and/or competition in the market for provision of public
transport services. The Government's strategy is to create a regional coordination entity empowered by the SPMR for
planning, coordinating and setting priorities for new investments and modal integration. This will be a dated covenant of
the proposed project.
*   Cost Recovery and Financial Management Issues. The need to address cost recovery from a more commercially
oriented standpoint by: (a) setting tariffs which, when added to subsidies, cover at least the long-run variable costs
(defined as out-of-pocket costs plus depreciation of equipment and cost of capital) of the service provided; (b)
controlling fare evasion; (c) appropriate peak and off-peak pricing; (d) improving the financial management of the
systems through wide-ranging cost cutting measures, staff rationalization policies, and employing more financial
managers to run the mass transit systems; and (e) revamping the funding mechanisms in order to guarantee adequate
financing for the implementation of new mass transit systems and the sustainability of the existing systems. To help
achieve these goals, the Sao Paulo State Government (GSP) has embarked on an aggressive campaign to promote
private sector participation in the urban transport sector, and will carry out the concessioning of CPTM.
*  Environmental Issues. Air pollution, noise, traffic congestion, and road accidents are major environmental issues to be
addressed in the SPMR. The reduction of the environmental impacts of urban congestion and noise pollution in the urban
area could be done through: (a) the allocation of responsibilities across government levels for the enforcement of the law
and definition of tougher standards; (b) the use of cleaner and quieter systems; (c) where appropriate, the use of non-
motorized transport; (d) improved traffic management and control; and (e) the strengthening of traffic safety education
and the enforcement of traffic regulations. As part of a long-term strategy, the Government is reviewing the potential role
of market-based incentives to address pollution as well as the implementation-to the extent possible-of the polluter-pay
principle to minimize the fiscal burden implied by de facto government subsidies to polluters. The financing of the noise
and emissions laboratory, as well as the PHRD grant which financed air-quality related studies to measure the impact of
vehicle emissions on health, contribute to these objectives.
*  Transport Planning Issues. The need to strengthen SPMR's transportation planning, traffic data base, traffic
management, and economic and financial evaluation of new investments could be met if there is a formal coordinating
agency for urban transport in the metropolitan region. This agency should be equipped with a battery of sketch planning,
demand and supply models which will test different land use, air quality, and urban transport scenarios. Furthermore, an
integrated land use, urban transport, and air-quality strategy should be designed and periodically revised. The institutional
component of the proposed project has provisions to finance this type of models and supporting studies.

7. Sector Issues to be Addressed by the Project and Strategic Choices:
.   Institutional Issues. A Regional Transport Coordination Commission (RTCC) would be created under the proposed
project. A forerunner to the RTCC already exists and would be strengthened from a forum for the discussion of
regional transport issues to a coordinating body empowered to guide transport planning and coordination for the
SPMR.
•   Environmental Issues. The proposed project's increased use of rail-based transport and decreased use of road-based
transport would improve air and noise pollution in the project area and lead to decreased accidents and less traffic
congestion. In addition, the Sao Paulo environmental agency will be equipped to carry out a comprehensive
inspection/maintenance program.
.   Cost Recovery and Financial Management Issues. The proposed project would increase passenger loads on the two
rail systems and hence would increase both revenue and cost recovery for CPTM. The concession of the operation
and maintenance of the system to the private sector will reduce the operating subsidies paid by the Government.

8. Project Alternatives Considered:
The following technical alternatives were compared at identification: (a) do nothing; (b) introduce reserved bus lanes; and (c)
build the rail link as proposed. The rail link at-grade was selected as the preferred altemative because of lower costs (no land
expropriation requirements and the utilization of existing right-of-way), elimination of modal transfers, congestion relief, and
shorter implementation schedule.

10. Lessons Learned and Reflected in Proposed Project Design:
Initial Bank support for the urban transport sector in Brazil was provided through four urban transport projects totaling
US$540 million, of which the First, Second and Third Urban Transport Projects (Loans 1563-BR, 1839-BR, 1965-BR) have
been completed. The Fourth Urban Transport Project was canceled because the government abolished the federal
agency in charge of urban transport (EBTU). Additional Brazilian urban transport projects financed by the Bank (Loans
3457-BR and 3633-BR for US$126 million and US$128 million respectively) support the rehabilitation and decentralization
of the CBTUs from the Federal to the State governments in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. Loan 3457-BR (Sao Paulo)
became effective on February 3, 1993. Loan 3633-BR (Rio de Janeiro) became effective on March 14, 1994. Loan 3457-
BR is expected to close on March 31, 1998 and has met its main objectives. Loan 3633-BR is expected to close on
December 31, 1998. In June 1995, the Board approved two more loans (Lns. 3915-BR and 3916-BR) for US$102 million
and US$99 million to finance the decentralization of the federally-funded Recife and Belo Horizonte urban rail systems to
the States. These loans were declared effective in 1996 and are progressing satisfactorily.
To build upon the experience of past urban transport projects for the design of the proposed project, an analysis of

Brazil                                                                Sao Paulo Integrated Urban Transport Project
"lessons learned" was undertaken. This review was based on Project Completion Reports and Performance Audit Reports
(PCR/PAR) in urban transport and urban development worldwide. Recognition was made of trends and changes in project
design since the PCRs/PARs were completed. The main lessons identified and incorporated into the design of the
proposed project are:
* Institutional Strengthening. The organizations dealing with urban transport at the federal, state and municipal levels should
be reorganized and strengthened. Studies included in the institutional component must be carefully monitored and
translated into action plans which the Borrower must implement. Dated loan covenants would be included in the proposed
project for the creation of the RTCC and completion of critical studies.
* Lack of counterpart funding has greatly influenced the pace of project implementation and in some cases has led to
cancellation of components. An effort must be made to ensure that adequate provision of counterpart funds is included in
the annual bu_gets of federal and state enterprises. The State of Sao Paulo has included the project in its CY97 and CY98
budgets, and has recently made available, on a timely basis, the counterpart funds required for all Bank financed projects.
* Siow implementation has been a frequently occurring theme. The reasons have included a lack of familiarity with Bank
procedures, over-optimistic scheduling at appraisal, lack of final engineering designs at appraisal, changes in political
commitment, and lack of counterpart funds. These problems would be mitigated in the proposed project by such measures
as: strengthening the capacity of operating agencies for financial management and application of Bank procedures; and
requiring final engineering design of the first year's works prior to negotiations, for which technical assistance would be
contracted as needed.
, Rail Decentralization. Experience in both ongoing Lns. 3457-BR and 3633-BR suggest that the decentralization of
systems from the federal to the state level must be followed by complete restructuring of the companies preferably with
concessioning of the operation and maintenance of the systems to the private sector. Otherwise, there is little motivation
for government-appointed managers to reduce working subsidies and improve the level of service offered by the systems.
n ic ions of Borrower Commitment and Ownership:
The Government of the State of Sao Paulo, through the creation of a Secretary for Metropolitan Transport, has indicated
the importance they attach to the provision and maintenance of an efficient metropolitan and suburban rail system. The
Government has also shown its commitment to the development of the rail system and to the proposed project by quickly
taking over the federally-owned and operated ex-CBTU Sao Paulo subdivision and by integrating it with the metropolitan
lines of the state-owned FEPASA system, thereby creating the CPTM. To fully integrate both systems from a physical
standpoint, the Government realized that it needs the link between the Barra Funda and Roosevelt stations, and it has
shown its commitment to this project by already having signed a contract for rolling stock to be used in that link.
Furthermore, the Governor and the Secretary of Transport have shown their ownership and commitment to the project by,
even during the worst financial straits, providing the subsidies required to cover the working deficit of CPTM and improve
the system. The proposed project, which has been on hold since 1994, was considered a priority by the State
administration as soon as the Federal Government authorized the resumption of borrowing from the Bank.

12. Value-added of Bank Support:
The proposed project consolidates and deepens the policy reforms initiated under the Sao Paulo Metropolitan Transport
Decentralization Project (Ln. 3457-BR), which assisted in the decentralization of the federally-owned CBTU to the State to
allow for more effective modal and tariff integration. The same loan financed a study to evaluate the options for concession of
the new state company that absorbed CBTU and FEPASA. This study is the foundation for the concession process which will
be carried out under this loan. The main value-added by the Bank in this project, is its role as promoter of physical and tariff
integration in the SPMR and as an honest broker to provide more credibility and ensure accountability in the CPTM
concession process. The concession of the system is supposed to eliminatel the operating subsidy to the system in its first
year of operation.

. ;Tecnical Assesment:
Compared with other alternatives such as reserved or exclusive busways, this is a sound project from a technical
standpoint bepause by adding only 7.3 km of main track, it will allow the SPMR to have a rail system fully connected with
270 km of track serving a wide geographical area. Furthermore, since this is an existing right-of-way and expropriation is
not required, there would be minimum disruption of the surrounding areas.
16. institutional Assessment:
There are three main government bodies responsible for overseeing the urban transport sector in the SPMR: (a) the
Secretaria de Transportes Metropolitanos do Estado de Sao Paulo (STMSP) created in 1991; (b) the Secretaria de Estado
dos Transportes (SET) which is responsible for roads and railways (other than suburban railways) in the State; and (c) the
Secretaria de Transportes da Prefeitura do Municipio de Sao Paulo (STM). STMSP is responsible for urban transport in the
metropolitan region outside the jurisdiction of SPM, and oversees the Sao Paulo Metro, CPTM and the metropolitan bus
company (EMTU). The ex-CBTU suburban train, which until 1994 was under federal government jurisdiction, was merged
with the ex-FEPASA (state-owned) metropolitan train to form the Companhia Paulista de Trens Metropolitanos (CPTM) which
is under the STMSP. Therefore, the whole rail-based network of the SPMR is under the STMSP along with the intermunicipal
buses. The municipal buses are under the jurisdiction of the municipalities of the SPMR.
Since three levels of government have been formulating policies and regulating urban transport without a formal coordinating
arrangement, there has been a lack of consistency in the fares charged by similar or competing modes, duplication of
investments, absence of criteria to prioritize investments, and only embryonic modal integration of the urban transport system.
This has led to bus services contnuing to operate in corridors where the subway is more suited, the lack of promotion of hub-
and-spoke services so as to encourage feeder services, and disparate subsidy policies which are often based on non-
economic considerations. This project will be one more step towards effective integration of the systems. The STMSP has
given a number of major steps to correct this situation.
.b   ........................................................................................  .....................................................................................................................................................
17. Social Assessment:
Most of the users of the CPTM system are low-income and live in the suburbs of the greater SPMR. Improving suburban
and metropolitan rail services in general increases the accessibility of this low-income segment of the population to
employment centers. Transport Users Associations have often stressed to Bank missions and to the precursor of the
RTCC the importance of having an efficient and above all reliable rail system. They have also stressed the need for more
integration with other modes. The project was presented several times to the public initially under the label of the Projeto
SIM (Sistema Integrado Metropolitano) in the previous government and in this government under the name of PITU
(Projeto Integrado de Transport Urbano). Requests from some small towns served by the system were taken into account
as well as requests from users associations which wanted the two main stations of Barra Funda and Roosevelt linked.
Suggestions received after the public presentations of the system were also incorporated. There is a consensus that this
project furthers the main goal of the beneficiaries: integration with other modes and between rail lines and the subway
system. No negative social impacts are expected from the proposed project.

Motor vehicle-generated air pollution in the SPMR is a major and growing threat to public health. Benefits due to its abatement
include decreased incidence of illnesses and premature death due to respiratory and cardiovascular illness, and
improvements in the overall well-being and quality of life of the population. Noise pollution generated by buses and
automobiles would also decrease due to a diversion of commuters to rail-based electrified systems. During construction of the
suburban train link, it is expected that, in some cases, the surrounding areas will be temporarily affected due to street closure
and excavation. These impacts will be minimized through techniques which allow construction without affecting the
surrounding area, and by re-routing road-based traffic. There is no resettlement or relocation in the proposed project since the
link would be built along the existing right-of-way. An environmental and safety audit of the CPTM system will be completed
prior to the concession by the firm selected as concession advisor, following terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank. The
impact on traffic congestion, overcrowding of buses, and vehicle accidents is expected to be positive. The project would have
a net beneficial impact on the environment. The CPTM link would help relieve congestion in a- major transport corridor,
resulting in lower emission of pollutants per vehicle-kilometer. On the basis of these assessments the project has been rated

20. Sustainability:
One of the main objectives of the proposed project is to establish long-term financial mechanisms and an institutional
framework which will ensure not only project sustainability, but also the financial sustainability of the Sao Paulo urban
transport system. During project preparation, the Sao Paulo State and Municipal Governments agreed to the creation of a
Regional Transport Coordination Commission. A precursor to the RTCC is already in operation. The concession of CPTM is
expected to substantially reduce operating and capital subsidies to the system and, in a very short period, produce "royalties"
which will be paid to the government for the concession of the system. A draft law defining financing mechanisms for the
urban transport sector, based on studies financed under Ln.3457-BR, will be submitted to the Sao Paulo Legislature.

having interested parties. There is a medium risk of political
opposition through the unions. However, the public mood in Brazil
since the concession of the Federal Railways is favorable to
concessions which might improve the level of service offered and
reduce government subsidies. Dated covenants for the issuing of the
pre-qualification documents and for the expected award were
included. The concession modeling process has been completed
under Ln.3457-BR.

22. Possible Controversial Aspects:
CPTM's concession, although backed by the govemment, might be opposed by the railway unions. However, since the
concession of the Federal railways system, concessions have become less and less controversial.

Detailed Project Description
A. Infrastructure and Equipment Component
This component will account for 90 percent of the total base cost and will have three subcomponents.
1.    Permanent Way Works which would include the construction of: (i) a track (No. 4) between
Roosevelt and Barra Funda; (ii) a rail link between tracks Nos. 3 and 4 of Lines A/D (Northwest/Southeast)
and the tracks J and I from Line E (East); (iii) one auxiliary track line for the long-distance passenger trains at
Barra Funda, and its linkage with track No.1 of Lines A/D at the same station; (iv) a rail link between tracks
No. I and 2 of Line B (West) with track No. 1 of Lines A/D, between Barra Funda and Agua Branca; and (v) a
parking/marshaling yard for the unit trains at Agua Branca. It would also include: (vi) the rehabilitation of line
No. 3 and minor improvements on adjacent track lines between Roosevelt and Barra Funda. In summary, a
total of 10.3 km of new main line tracks and 1.8 km of secondary tracks at Agua Branca yard would be built.
2.     Civil Works which would include: (i) at Luz Station, the construction of two underground pedestrian
passages to facilitate the access to and from the Metro station and Av. Casper Libero and Luz square
passengers to suburban trains and bus lines. It would also include the construction of a new mezzanine and
the installation of 14 automatic escalators and 3 elevators for handicapped passengers, and the provision of
illumination points; (b) the main building restoration, preserving its original construction characteristics; (ii) at
Bras/Roosevelt Station, platforms and tracks rearrangement and the construction of a mezzanine to
interconnect with Metro Bras station, including mechanical escalators and elevators for handicapped
passengers; (iii) at Barra Funda Station, installation of elevators for handicapped passengers and turnstiles
rearrangement; and (iv) Barra Funda Operational Control Center (O.C.C.) building construction.
3.    Systems Works which would include: (i) installation of a signaling system over the track lines on the
rail link designed to: (a) extend the Eastem line from Roosevelt Terminal to Barra Funda station (the new
terminal station); (b) provide this section with the necessary equipment to reach a theoretical headway of 2.5
minutes (real time of 3 minutes). The new system in the link once implemented would allow a greater
availability of equipment and increase the carrying capacity at this section (estimated demand of 42,000
passengers per hour and per direction) with an initial headway of 8 minutes. The signaling works will
introduce changes on the RoosevelVtBras-Barra Funda section of the existing Northwest/Southeast line such
as modify tracks Nos. 3 and 4 (bi-directional) for traffic from the East line and keep tracks Nos. I and 2 (bi-
directional) to permit its use for traffic from the Northwest/Southeast. The works will also include a new traffic
control center for the Barra Funda - Bras section, and automatic train stopping/speed control signaling
devices on the EMUs; (ii) implementation of a new traffic supervision center for monitoring all CPTM lines
located at the Barra Funda O.C.C.(iii) installation of the catenary over the track lines on the Barra Funda -
Roosevelt rail link and the Agua Branca yard; (iv) illumination of the new yard at Agua Branca and the
relocation of some existing lamp posts on the rail link section; (v) the provision of automatic turnstiles for
proper passenger control and tariff integration at the stations of the Barra Funda-Tatuape section of Line E
(East).
B. Air Quality Component
4.    This component will account for 9 percent of the total base cost and will include the civil works and
equipment for a vehicle emissions and noise laboratory for diesel trucks.
C. Institutional and Policy Development Component
5.    This component will account for 1 percent of the total base cost and will assist in carrying out the
concession of CPTM, establishing a Regional Transport Coordination Commission for the SPMR, and
preparing an integrated transport, land use, and air-quality management strategy for the SPMR.

a' The difference between financial and economic benefits can be explained by the differences in the stream
of benefits and costs captured by the two analyses. Whereas the financial evaluation of the project focused
on the CPTM's finances and its proforma income statement, the economic evaluation assigned economic
values to the inputs of the financial evaluation and also extended the analysis to capture additional direct and
indirect benefits related to road maintenance, reduction in accidents, improvements in air quality, vehicle
operating costs, and time savings by riders using the train as well as buses. Additionally, the economic
evaluation took into account benefits arising from the total ridership irrespective of the revenues not collected
by CPTM due to a high level of fare evasion during the early years as well as "free" riders (e.g., the elderly,
students, military and police personnel, and CPTM employees) for which CPTM must absorb the cost by law.
Since the effect of fare evasion is especially felt during the initial years, the discounting method shows much
higher return in the case of the economic evaluations.
The methodology used consisted in comparing the situation with and without project and quantifying the
benefits due to time savings for users of all modes, operating cost savings for all modes, road maintenance
cost savings, accident savings, air pollution savings and the investment and operating costs. The demand by
each mode was determined using a demand model which estimated the passenger-hours and passenger-
kms saved by mode with the project.
Overall Risk:
Probability that NPV<0 is negligible
Main Assumptions:
Discount Rate = 10%
Growth in demand = 2% after year 2000

All disbursements under contracts of less than US$5 million for works, such as systems, permanent way, and
assembly of rolling stock, and of less than US$350,000 for goods would be made on the basis of certified statements
of expenditure (SOEs) prepared by CPTM. SOE limits for consultant service contracts would be US$100,000 for
firms and US$50,000 for individuals. Supporting documentation for the SOEs would be retained by CPTM and made
available for examination by Bank staff during supervision missions. To expedite project execution, a Special
Account would be opened in a commercial bank under terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank with an
authorized allocation of up to US$3.0 million equivalent. This account would be replenished for the amount of
withdrawals on account of eligible expenditures. Authorization is sought for retroactive financing of up to US$4.5
million (10 percent of loan funds) in accordance with the Bank's standard guidelines. This retroactive financing would
be for expenditures made twelve months prior to loan signing and cover items such as the preparation of final
engineering designs which must be carried out to complete the project preparation. The disbursement arrangements
were discussed and agreed upon during negotiations.

Prepared by: STMSP and CPTM with assistance from Bank staff
Preparation assistance: Division's budget
Bank staff who worked on the project included: Jorge Rebelo (Task Manager and Prncipal Transport
Specialist), Jose Baigonia (Sr. Railway Engineer) and Moazzam Mekan (Financial Analyst); and Jose Carbajo
(Economist, TWUTD), Alberto Ninio (Counsel, LEGLA), Jose Carvalho (Sr. Counsel, LEGLA), Kenneth Knight
(Metro Infrastructure Consultant), Jose Ricardo B. de Marca (Transport Economist Consultant); Alberto
Figueiredo-Nunes (Procurement and Cost Consultant). Messrs/Mmes. Teresa Serra (Environmental Specialist,
LATEN), Nelly Comet (Transport Demand Specialist), Dave Crowley (Transport Demand Consultant), Ben
Porter (Private Sector Development Consultant), Christopher Weaver (Air Quality Consultant), and Enrique
Villalon (Automatic Fare Collection Consultant) also participated in the preparation of the Project. Messrs. John
Flora (TWUTD) and Sam Zimmerman (U.S. Federal Transit Administration) were the Peer Reviewers. Mr. Craig
Leisher edited the report. Ms. Allison Tumer helped prepare this report.
Note: The project was initially prepared under the name of Sao Paulo Integrated Urban Transport Project
which included in addition to the Barra Funda-Roosevelt link, the Metro's 4th Line for a total estimated
cost of US$1.272 billion. This initial version of the project was authorized for negotiations on August 22,
1994. These negotiations did not take place because at that time the Federal Government of Brazil did not
reach an agreement with the State of Sao Paulo on the rescheduling of its debt. In February 1997, a debt
rescheduling agreement was.signed and the Bank received the green light to proceed with a re-appraisal
of the project. At the request of the Borrower, the original project was split in two separate projects: the
Barra Funda-Roosevelt link and the Sao Paulo Metro 4th line. This split reflects the acceptance by the
Borrower to undertake the Metro's 4th line under a BOT scheme which will be partially financed by the
private sector. The preparation of the Metro's 4th line is underway and the project is expected to be
appraised by May 1998.
