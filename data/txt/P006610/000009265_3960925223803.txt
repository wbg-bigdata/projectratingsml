SUBJECT:    Project Completion Report on Chile First
Road Sector Proiect (Loan 2589-CH)
Attached is the report entitled "Project Completion Report on Chile -
Road Sector Project (Loan 2589-CH)", prepared by the Latin America and the
Caribbean Regional Office.   The report incorporates findings of an ex-post
project evaluation conducted by the borrower (Part II). It provides a full and
informative account of project outcomes.
The project, a sector investment operation, aimed at rehabilitation
of the road system, strengthening of the maintenance organization, improving
economic evaluation and facilitating a shift from force account to contract
maintenance.   Implementation benefitted from strong government commitment,
competent participation by the private sector (consultants and maintenance
contractors) and effective Bank support.   The reestimated economic returns
associated with project investments are highly favorable and the institutional
innovations have been successful. Overall project performance is rated as satis-
factory, institutional development as substantial and sustainability as likely.
The project will be audited to secure a full analysis of the basic
conditions for success and to document experience with the "sector" format.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
(FIRST) ROAD SECTOR PROJECT
LOAN 2589-CH
Preface
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the First Road
Sector Project in Chile, for which Loan 2589-CH in the amount of US$140
million equivalent was approved on October 10, 1985. The loan was closed on
June 30, 1990, which is one year later than originally expected. This was due
to the Government realizing very shortly after negotiations that it was going
to be financially impossible to execute the project in the planned three year
period, and the project was converted to a four-year program. The last
disbursement took place on July 19, 1990.
Parts I and III of this Project Completion Report were prepared by
the Infrastructure and Energy Operations Division of the Latin America and the
Caribbean Regional Office (LA4IE). Part II is a translation of some comments
made by the Government in its final report.1' Preparation of this PCR was
based on the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR), the Loan Agreement, supervision
reports, correspondence between the Bank and the Borrower, internal memoranda,
the Government's Final Report on the project and experience of the authors
gained during the full cycle of project preparation and implementation.
1/ The Government's-comments on Parts I and III have also been incorporated.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
(FIRST) ROAD SECTOR PROJECT (LOAN 2589-CH)
Evaluation Summary
Obiectives
1.        The main objective of the (First) Road Sector Project (Loan
2589-CH)lI was to help the Government, both institutionally and financially,
with the execution of its road reconstruction and rehabilitation program and
with the establishment of an effectively functioning road maintenance
organization. Specifically, the project was to: (a) help with main road
reconstruction; (b) continue to improve the organization and execution of
overall maintenance, not only of the basic network (22,000 km) but also of the
rest of the network, which was to be turned over to the municipalities; (c)
study possible voluntary physical and financial contributions to the
maintenance of the remaining 56,000 km of the network; (d) improve the Roads
Directorate's (Vialidad) competence in the economic evaluation of road
maintenance and rehabilitation activities; (e) strengthen the capabilities of
Vialidad's road maintenance staff through a comprehensive training program
geared mainly at works and consultant contract management (paras 3.01 and
3.02).
Implementation Experience
2.        Due to lack of counterpart funds, early in the project execution
period, the appraised three year program had to be spread over four years.
Otherwise project implementation occurred in a timely and efficient manner.
Whereas the economic evaluation had to be done on the basis of estimated data,
during the implementation period adequate measuring equipment was procured
(under Loan 2297-CH) and the basis was laid for economic evaluation of the
successor project on the basis of actual measurements, mainly of pavement
roughness (paras 5.01 to 5.04).
Results
3.        The project met fully its revised objectives.  The condition of the
Basic Road Network was substantially improved and the road maintenance
capacity of the Borrower's Roads Directorate was strengthened considerably, as
well as its pavement management system. Further progress was made in
augmenting the funds for, and the quality of the rolling four-year road
maintenance and investment program. Annual road expenditures in constant
dollars at March 31, 1985 prices increased from US$237 million to some US$264
million in 1988-1989 and maintenance expenditures increased from 26? of total
road expenditures (net of debt service) for the period 1982-1985 to some 552
for the period 1986-1989. Some US$4 million in expenditures for consulting
2/   There is a follow-up Second Road Sector Project (Loan 3120-CH) currently
under implementation.



services and training consisted mainly of contracts for (a) preparation and
supervision of works, (b) economic studies related to the transport sector,
(c) continuation of a long-range pavement evaluation and management study
begun under the Second Highway Reconstruction Project (Loan 2297-CH), and (d)
a study to adapt the Bank's Highway Design and Maintenance Standards Model
(HDM), which was used in the evaluation of the program, to handle cement
concrete roads, which play a major role in the Chilean paved network (para
6.01).
4.        The internal rate of return (IRR) for all activities on the
bituminous paved network (including construction and reconstruction) came to
37%, whereas the IRR of interventions on the unpaved network came to over
100%. This substantially confirmed appraisal estimates (49% and more than
100%). The very high rates of return on the unpaved network were the result
of continued substantial underspending for maintenance of these roads and the
heavy traffic they already carry (para 6.02).
5.        The project also had a very positive impact on the morale and the
analysis and implementation capacity of the staff of the Borrower's Ministry
of Public Works (MOP) and, to some extent, of the Ministry of Transport. It
was also clear from conversations and press coverage that the public was
increasingly aware of the improved quality of the primary networks (para
6.03).
Sustainabilitv
6.        This was the first of a series of projects which, in a period of
twelve to sixteen years, were intended to transform the Ministry's Vialidad
into an excellent road management organization. Given that Vialidad almost
exclusively consists of engineers, the degree of sustainability is obviously
higher on the engineering than on the management and economic side, although
great progress has been made in interesting engineers in economics through the
use of the Bank's HDM Model. Unfortunately, given the scarcity and excellent
marketability of engineers with HDM skills, the turn-over of these engineers
has been higher than average, reducing the continuity of the planning process
somewhat. Altogether, supervision of contract work, partially through the
intermediary of consultants, was very good, and continued interest on the part
of the Government and other lenders have contributed substantially to
sustainability as far as the basic road network is concerned. A second four-
year program is now underway with increased coverage of the network and a
third is being prepared with further increase in quality and depth of coverage
(paras 7.01 and 7.02).
Lessons Learned
7.        Detailed and participatory preparation of the project ensured
interest and quality execution at all levels of Vialidad and the Ministry
(MOP). Continuity of experienced staff, both on the Government's and the
Bank's side during project preparation and execution, was very important for
quality and sustainability. The quality and continuity of the Government's
staff made post-appraisal and preparation of the follow-up project (Second
Road Sector Project - Loan 3120-CH) particularly meaningful. The quality of
exchanges between Goverrment and Bank staff was very high and increasingly
Chilean staff have participated in and benefitted from Bank in-house training.



8.        The excellent results obtained with contractor execution of
maintenance were largely due to the quality of supervision and mutual respect
between contractors and Government, the latter favorably enhanced by the
Government's prompt payment (on average not more than seven days after
submission of bills) (paras 9.04 and 9.05).

2.  Background
2.01        During the execution of a series of two Highway Reconstruction
Projects--which were necessary because the basic road network (22,000 km) was
falling apart, for lack of maintenance, while the Santiago metro was
constructed--it became clear that a major long-term effort would be necessary
to help the Government shift from force account to contractor maintenance and
to restore the balance between construction and maintenance in its road
program. In addition, since the mid-19709, the Chilean Government had been
expanding municipal responsibilities and in the process decreasing Central
Government budgets for services, among others road maintenance. Consequently,
responsibility for the local road network (56,000 km) was to be turned over to
the municipalities. This, however, was not implemented for lack of capacity
on the part of the municipalities to handle that task (para 2.03). A new
study of possible municipalization of some road maintenance is underway under
the Second Road Sector Project (Loan 3120-CH).
2.02        During transport sector work and appraisal of the Second Highway
Reconstruction Project (Loan 2297-CH) in 1983, the Bank identified as major
issues:
(a)   the need to provide more adequate funding and better organization
for maintenance of the road network, and particularly for the
basic highway network; and
(b)   the uncertainty surrounding the intended execution and financing
of local road maintenance by the municipalities.
2.03        The first issue was addressed and partially resolved by making
execution of an adequate road program for the basic network a covenant of Loan



- 2 -
2297-CH and by addressing a larger network under Loan 2589-CH, subject of this
report (47,000 km). The second issue was addressed by commissioning a study
to prepare a plan of action to find adequate financing for the maintenance of
the local network. Early in the study period the Government came to the
conclusion that the municipalities neither had the equipment, the personnel
nor the funds to perform adequate maintenance of local roads.   Vialidad,
therefore, started in mid-1983 a pilot rural maintenance programs in three
southern provinces to establish the extent of possible voluntary contributions
for the execution of these programs. On the basis of these programs, Vialidad
concluded, in consultation and agreement with the Ministries of the Interior
and Finance and the Bank, that it should reestablish, as an objective, to
resume responsibility for most of the network, expecting at best some
voluntary cooperation from the municipalities on roads easily accessible to
the villagers. The program prepared for this project by Vialidad therefore
included only the maintenance of the basic and the primary local network
(47,000 km) and a lump sum of money for performing spot interventions on the
less traveled remaining 32,000 km (Secondary Local Network). Finally, during
negotiations, it was agreed that Vialidad would prepare, by December 31, 1986,
a maintenance plan for secondary local roads satisfactory to the Bank,
including, if necessary, a redefinition of the physical and financial role of
the municipalities.
3.  Proiect Oblectives and Desaription
3.01        Proiect Objectives.  The main objective of the project was to help
the Government, both institutionally and financially, with the execution of
its road reconstruction and rehabilitation program and with the establishment
of an effectively functioning road maintenance organization. Specifically,
the project was designed to help the Government:
(a)   complete a major main road reconstruction effort;
(b)   continue to improve the organization and execution of overall
maintenance of roads;
(c)   establish a functional local road maintenance system with improved
technical execution;
(d)   improve Vialidad's competence in the economic evaluation of road
maintenance and rehabilitation activities;
(e)   streamline the cooperation of municipalities in road maintenance
efforts through a study of possible voluntary physical and
financial contributions; and
(f)   strengthen the capability of Vialidad's Road Maintenance
Directorate through a comprehensive training program.
3.02        Proiect Description.  The project originally consisted of
financing some 21Z of the Government's three year (1986-1988) Road Investment
and Maintenance Program including all activities which were not already
financed by then ongoing Bank Loan 2297-CH and IDB projects. This was later



- 3 -
changed to a four-year program when the Government realized that budgetary
constraints would not permit it to have sufficient counterpart funds for the
program to be executed within a three-year period due to reconstruction needs
after the March 1985 earthquake. Specifically, the project included civil
works--to be executed mainly by contractors--although there was also a small
amount of force account work, mainly for routine maintenance, and some
procurement of equipment and consulting services for preparation of individual
subprojects.
4. Proiect Design and Organization
4.01        Conceptual Framework.  Experience with the first two highway
reconstruction projects of the 1980s indicated that there was substantial
underspending for roads and also a substantial imbalance between road
construction and road maintenance expenditures. In addition, the Government,
which had just radically downsized the Ministry of Public Works (MOP) from
more than 14,000 to less than 8,000 employees, was afraid to see MOP's staff
grow again when expenditures had to be increased. To avoid this the
Government had decreed that MOP would only be responsible for the 22,000 km
basic network. To spend more and retain responsibility for the whole network
or at least a network substantially larger than the basic one, a private
contractor-oriented strategy had to be devised, not only for construction but
also for maintenance, including routine maintenance. The staff of MOP, which
in the past had been oriented to execution by force account, would have to be
retrained and reoriented, and the Government, eventually even the MOP
management, felt that Bank experience elsewhere in the world would be useful
to make this transformation successfully.
4.02        There was not only the problem of underspending, particularly for
road maintenance, but there was also a serious overinvestment possibility in
the Austral Road. This major penetration road in the Austral area of the
country, where at that time less than 70,000 Chileans lived, was being
partially financed by the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) with a US$36
million loan. Construction expenditures for this road alone would have
averaged almost US$15 million per year over the project period, whereas MOP
had been able to spend less.than US$5 million per year on road maintenance in
the first half of the 1980s. Although MOP was initially reluctant to see the
Bank influencing the rate of expenditures fQr this, at best, marginal
construction project, MOP soon realized that the Bank's HDM analysis could
play a major role in convincing its Government and particularly the Finance
Ministry that continued underspending for maintenance would endanger the
recently reconstructed basic network, and the Finance Ministry welcomed the
Bank as a participant in its budgetary discussions with MOP and the IMF, which
was imposing budgetary conditionality.
4.03        These circumstances called for a (sub)sector project.  Structural
adjustment loans had been successful macro-economically, and it was now tima
to tackle some of the lingering sectoral and subsectoral issues. All relevant
parties had a clear understanding of the conceptual foundations for a
subsector project, which would allow the Bank to influence spending priorities
in the sector. Bank management indicated that only when an acceptable balance
between construction and maintenance expenditure were reached would the Bank



- 4 -
be ready to finance a substantial portion of Chile's road sector expenditures.
The suitability of a road (sub)sector loan was enhanced by the fact that there
was a need for further foreign exchange assistance to Chile. Moreover, given
Chile's massive privatization effort and reluctance to give Government
guarantees for loans, even those to the few remaining state enterprises such
as railways and ports, this subsector became an important vehicle for that
assistance.
4.04        Innovative Aspects.  This project was very innovative for Chile,
not only because it supported the continued shift from force account to
contract maintenance, but particularly because it fostered MOP's commitment to
try out the Bank's Highway Design and Maintenance Model (HDH), which was to
provide an authoritative argument for increased maintenance expenditures.
Although the initial analysis would have to be done with inputs that had to be
to a large extent estimated on the basis of Bank experience elsewhere in the
world and more specifically in Brazil, the project would also provide MOP a
foundation and financing for a major road deterioration measurement and study
effort in cooperation with local universities.
4.05        Other innovative aspects of this project were, apart from the fact
that it was the first road subsector project in Chile, the wide participation
outside the public sector and the leading role of the public sector in all
aspects of project preparation, including HDM analysis and report preparation
in Washington (up to yellow cover). The Catholic University of Chile
continued to be in charge of a research program on bituminous roads and the
University of Chile on cement concrete roads. Consultants were put in charge,
not only of certain aspects of project preparation, but also of project
supervision. The quality of project preparation was very good and the major
findings of the HDM analysis, though based largely on estimated inputs, were
later confirmed on the basis of measured inputs during the preparation of the
Second Road (Sub)Sector Project.
4.06        Proiect Preparation.  Project preparation up to yellow cover
stage, particularly the preparation and successive reformulations of the
Government's road investment and maintenance program, was completely in the
hands of the Government. MOP sent one engineer for two months to Washington
to discuss and rerun the HDM analysis and help in the preparation of the
appraisal report. As a result, the roles and responsibilities of the Bank,
MOP and Hacienda (Ministry of Finance) were clearly understood.
5. Proiect Implementation
5.01        Changes in Implementation.  Project implementation started in a
timely and efficient manner. During negotiations for the 1986 budget, when
MOP and Hacienda realized that it would not be possible to allocate sufficient
funds to execute the three year program as agreed with the Bank, they
immediately informed and convinced the Bank that it would be necessary to
spread the program over a four year period. As a result, further project
implementation was exemplary and the project was successfully completed
according to the revised schedule (one year after the original foreseen
closing date).



-5-
5.02        There were seven other changes that had to be made during project
implementation (four of which required a formal modification of the loan
agreement) which somewhat reduced the availability of funds for maintenance:
(a)   after heavy floods in the central zone of Chile, the Bank by
letter of July 11, 1986, duly countersigned by the Minister of
Works allowed the Government to spend US$6.3 million of the loan
on emergency road and bridge reconstruction; the change in loan
agreement was necessary because at appraisal the Bank agreed to
disburse proceeds from the loan against maintenance works,
consulting services and training only, and not against
construction works;
(b)   by letter of April 30 of 1987, duly countersigned, the Bank
allowed the Government to use proceeds from the loan for the
purchase of US$0.3 computer hardware and software;
(c)   by letter of September 9, 1987, duly countersigned by the
Government, the Bank allowed under emergency bidding procedures
additional US$33 million of reconstruction and new construction
work after an earthquake in the north and central regions and two
bad rainstorms;
(d)   on December 3, 1987, the Bank agreed also to finance continuation
of construction of the Santiago-San Antonio expressway (which was
started under an earlier project but not continued under the next
because the Government was trying to arrange financing by
concession) on condition that the overall Vialidad budget be
increased by the amount of the needed counterpart funds (some US$5
million), to ensure that maintenance of the rest of the networks
would not suffer;
(e)   by letter of June 14, 1988, countersigned by the Government, the
description of category 3 "Goods and equipment for part C-3 of the
Project" was changed to "Goods and equipment for part B-2 of the
Project" after the Government had decided to finance computer
items (see (b) above) totally with its own funds;
(f)   in December 1988 the limit of US$65 million for maintenance work
by force account was increased to US$75 million (point 11 of the
Aide-Memoire of December 22, 1991); and
(g)   on July 17, 1989, the Government requested and by telex of August
25, 1988, the Bank agreed to reassign some funds between
categories. This led to final disbursement figures as indicated
in Part III.
5.03        Possible Avoidance of Chanxes.  The variance of para 5.01 may have
been avoided by reducing Government contribution to the program, which under
the original circumstances (without B loan) amounted to some 61%. This could
have been achieved by funding a larger than US$300 million B-loan, or more
multilateral or bilateral participation, as was the case under the successor



Second Road Sector Project with larger contributions by IDB and the Japanese
Eximbank. The other seven variances were the result of the Bank targeting its
disbursements at maintenance, to guarantee its proper execution. As it is
very difficult to forecast emergencies and their cost, these variances were
unavoidable.
5.04        Actions Affectina Implementation.  The continuous, direct and
fruitful dialog, often by phone, between MOP and Bank staff and the timeliness
of actions by Government (including payments of contractors within a week
after submission of bills) had a very positive effect on project
implementation.
6. Project Results
6.01        The project fully met its objectives (para 3.01) in qualitative
terms. Also in quantitative terms it substantially met the revised objectives
after the 3-year program was transformed into a 4-year program. Actual total
expenditures at constant March 1985 prices amounted to some US$719 million
against projected expenditures of US$818 million and maintenance amounted to
55% of total against 56% projected.
6.02        Economic Results.  As explained in Section 6 B of Part III of this
report, the economic analysis to confirm the internal economic rate of return
(ERR) of the appraisal team was ca2rried out with the Bank's HDM model,
version III, by a group of Chilean consultants and civil servants. The
internal rate of return for paved road maintenance and reconstruction came out
at some 37% compared with some 49% at appraisal. Also, the NPV figures
compare favorably between appraisal and after completion. The figures for
specific projects were presented by the Government in three volumes of annexes
to the final report of the project. The volumes contain no major unexpected
findings.
6.03        Prolect Impact.  This project had a continued strengthening impact
on the Roads Department of the Chilean Ministry of Works (MOP) by improving
capacity to program and carry out balanced multiyear road maintenance and
investment programs. The small equipment purchase helped the Government to
react promptly to frequently occurring emergencies, and to keep contract costs
down in case of emergency. The continued frequent use of local consultants
for project preparation and supervision, for the overall monitoring of the
program, and for research through local universities made it possible for the
Government to keep staff requirements in MOP at a minimum. Finally, the
multiple local and overseas training activities, and the permanent contract
with universities for research made it possible for Vialidad staff to be at
the edge of competence and helped considerably in building staff moral and
self-esteem. The project clearly contributed to improved communications and
thus to the enhancement of exports and overall economic development.

programs and the continued improvement in the quality of force account and
contract work, particularly of bituminous road work, as well as the new
Government's good sense in keeping most key personnel in place at the time of
a major change in political administration, is a very good omen for the
sustainability of this project. The sustainability was further enhanced by
the continuity of the dialogue between MOP and the Bank in the preparation,
under the previous administration, and the execution, under the new
administration, of a Second Road Sector Project (Loan 3120-CH for the 1990-
1993 program).
7.02        Overall transport sector dialogue is being further strengthened by
the follow up Second Road Sector Project, but also by a parallel Urban Streets
and Transport Project (Loan 3028-CH) and by a first Transport Infrastructure
Project (Loan 3426-CH) which is de facto a first port project.
8.          Bank Performance
8.01        Preparation and Appraisal.  During the execution of the First and
Second Highway Reconstruction Projects (Loans 1927 and 2297-CH) the Bank
became quite familiar with the Borrower's strengths and needs and successfully
recommended and monitored all actions needed to prepare a successful
(sub)sector project.
8.02        Supervision.  There was remarkable continuity of staff in Chile
and at the Bank, where at least one person and most of the time the same
economist and engineer responsible from preparation through appraisal and
supervision for this project and also the previous one and through the next.
The Bank also showed considerable responsiveness to Chile's emergency needs.
This was very important, as the Bank was financing a substantial percentage of
all road maintenance and investment expenditures of the Government while
ensuring that the program remained balanced between maintenance and
investment. Given the size of the loan (US$140 million) total staff input
from identification to loan closure (115 staff weeks) was very low.
9.          Borrower Performance
9.01        The Borrower accepted the Bank's'recommendation to start focussing
on maintenance by contract and on a computer based road maintenance and
investment planning model, the Bank's HDM. Just with the free diskettes and
manuals put at their disposal, Vialidad staff and Chilean university personnel
quickly managed the use of the Bank's model. Lack of time and measuring
equipment made it necessary to fill in the missing data with informed
estimates. Given the impressive track record of the Chileans, the Bank
accepted to have all preparatory work done without the use of foreign
consultants. In the final phase of project preparation, a Chilean civil
servant came to Bank Headquarters for two months to finalize the HDM analysis
and to help in the production of the Bank's appraisal report.
9.02        Strengths and Weaknesses.  The performance of the staff of the
Government's Roads Directorate (Vialidad) was of a high standard, not only in
project preparation, but also in project execution, due to the staff's
schooling, on the job training, continuity and dedication at all levels.



There was also close interaction with Bank staff by phone and correspondence
or in person during Bank staff visits to Chile.
9.03        The most outstanding feature was most probably that payments to
contractors and consultants were made promptly (on average less than a week
after presentation of bills). Disbursement applications to the Bank were
promptly and well prepared. Audit reports by the Contraloria de la Republica
(the State's Central Administrative Control Office) were of good quality and
submitted on time. Suggestions to improve the analytic content were well
received and the Government complied with all loan covenants (Part III).
9.04        Lessons and ExDeriences.  Detailed and participatory preparation
of the project ensured interest and quality execution at all levels of
Vialidad and the Ministry (MOP). Continuity of experienced staff, both on the
Government's and the Bank's side during project preparation and execution were
very important for quality and sustainability, and made preparation and pre-
appraisal of the follow-up project (Loan 3120-CH) particularly meaningful.
The quality of exchanges between Government and Bank staff was very high and
increasingly Chilean staff, benefitting from Bank in-house training, started
helping in training and project preparation in less-endowed countries.
9.05        The excellent results obtained with contractor execution of
maintenance were largely due to the quality of supervision and mutual respect
between contractors and Government. The latter was favorably enhanced by the
Government's prompt paying policies.
10.         Prolect Relationships
10.01       Bank Borrower Relations.  The Bank's relationship with the
Ministers of Public Works and Finance and their staff was very close and
flexible and always channelled through the task manager. This facilitated
fruitful interaction and coordinated and timely decision-making.
10.02       Internal Relations of the Borrower.  Good relations between MOP
and the Ministry of Finance ensured timely availability of funding.  Despite
general budgetary constraints, Finance became increasingly aware that there
was need for a steadily growing effort in road maintenance. There was also a
close working relationship between Contraloria (the Government's Central
Control Office), which has a permanent presence in the offices of MOP, and the
Roads Directorate's staff. This allowed competent and timely preparation of
annual audit reports. The relationship of MOP with the Planning Office could
be improved. The main reason for the apparently cool relationship between
these two agencies might be the Planning office's skepticism of overall
sectoral planning devices (such as the Bank's HDM model) and continued
insistence on a road by road economic justification procedure.
10.03       Internal relations in MOP between the Minister and the Director of
the Roads Directorate, and between the Director and his central and regional
staff were very close and effective, which contributed substantially to the
project's su..cess. The MOP officials frequently used HDM print-outs in the
field to stave off political interference.

11.         Consultint Services/Procurement of Goods and Works
11.01       A large number of local consulting firms performed cost-
effectively and efficiently the following tasks:
(a)   engineering studies (80 contracts);
(b)   supervision of works (37 contracts); and
(c)   overall project coordination (1 contract).
All firms, many staffed with former MOP personnel, appear to have
performed satisfactorily.
11.02       The small though increased amount of procurement of goods was
carried out expeditiously and cost-effectively (US$2.3 million) see paragraph
5.02 (e) above.
11.03       Works were mainly executed by contract, although a small amount of
routine and some periodic maintenance work was executed by force account on
the basis of regularly recalculated and re-approved unit prices (US$74.4
million in total). There was a total of 1,240 contracts for works, which were
all successfully completed under the project or partially completed and passed
on to the follow-up project (Loan 3120-CH). International Competitive Bidding
(ICB) between prequalified bidders was used for all civil works contracts in
excess of US$2 million (some US$58 million in total). Local competitive
bidding, which is also open to expatriate firms, was used for the rest of the
contracts.
12.         Prolect Documentation and Data
12.01       The Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) and the loan agreement provided a
good framework for project implementation. Every three months MOP provided
such a comprehensive progress report on project status that it was necessary
to request the insertion of.an executive summary.  Data needed for the
preparation of the PCR were readily available in the Government's Final Report
and in Bank files. Aide Memoires and forms 590 prepared after each mission
were also very helpful in the preparation of this report.

PART II: PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
1.          Confirmation of Factual Information in Part III of the PCR
1.01        Specialized MOP staff has reviewed and approved the information
and results presented in Part III of this report.
2.          Comment on Analysis Contained in Part I of the PCRI'
2.01        During the execution of a series of two Highway Reconstruction
Projects, which were necessary because the basic road network (22,000 km) had
fallen apart for lack of maintenance while the Santiago metro was constructed,
it became clear that a major long-term effort would be necessary to help the
Government shift from force account to contractor maintenance and to restore
the balance between construction and maintenance in its road program. In
addition, since the mid-1970s, the Chilean Government had been expanding
municipal responsibilities and in the process decreasing Central Government
budgets for services, among others road maintenance. Consequently,
responsibility for the secondary municipal road network (56,000 km) was to be
turned over to the municipalities. This, however, was not implemented for
lack of capacity on the part of the municipalities to handle that task (para
2.03). A new effort at municipalization of some road maintenance is underway
under the Second Road Sector Project (Loan 3120-CH).
3.          Evaluation of Bank's Performance
3.01        The last paragraph of the conclusion of the Government's final
report on this project reads as follows:
"It is important to note that the first Road Sector Project has
opened a new horizon for cooperation with international financial
institutions. For the first time in Chile was a program implemented
which financed partially all expenditures in a particular sector, in
this case the road sector, with special emphasis on road maintenance.
This project obliged the executing agency to implement new supervisory
and control procedures which were satisfactory for the attainment of
both the Government and the Bank's goals. The success of the endeavor
is without a doubt due to the close collaboration and constant
preoccupation of the Bank staff, particularly in the Procurement,
Disbursement and Infrastructure Operations Divisions, which made it
possible for the Roads Directorate, in the framework of the guidelines
of the documents of Loan 2589-CH, to overcome all difficulties in
opportune and innovative fashion".
1/ These comments have been taken into account in the wording of the
corresponding paragraphs of Part I of this report.



- 11 -
3.02        Compared to what happened during the execution of Loan 2297-CH,
the Bank in this case sent detailed comments on the audit reports, which were
conducive to improved information, accounting and auditing procedures.
4.          Evaluation of the Borrower's Performance
4.01        The project had an important impact of institutional strengthening
on MOP's Roads Directorate through:
(a)   further perfecting the Directorate's capacity for road planning
and pavement management with the Bank's HDM model;
(b)   improving the maintenance department's capacity to implement works
and supervise contractors;
(c)   training of staff locally and abroad;
(d)   further expanding and deepening of the pavement research program.
5.          Assessment of Relations between the Borrower and the Bank
5.01        Relations between the Bank, MOP and the Ministry of Finance, as
well as with the Ministry of Transport and Telecommunications were close and
fluent. MOP made it a special point emphasizing the technical support
received from Bank missions during project implementation.

a' Although these numbers look very good, in fact most training was computer-use training and not the program originally
planned. A, a result, only 1/3 the amount originally planned was spent on training (see page 18) because of the
Ministry of Finance's reluctance to allow such large training efforts.

6.   Prolect Results
A. Direct Benefits
No indicators of direct benefits were established at appraisal.
B. Economic Impact
1.        A comparison of the internal rates of return (IRR) and net present
values (NPV) obtained with the HDM model at appraisal and after completion of
the project can be found in the table below. Because of the limitations of
the model and the nature of the project the analysis performed with the HDM
was partial (incomplete) and the results obtained, in spite of overall lower
expenditures, were similar as far as IRR is concerned, and lower as far as NPV
was concerned as a result of lower amounts of expenditures than foreseen at
appraisal. A detailed overall economic analysis can be found as an annex to
the Government's Final Report on the project and a detailed post evaluation of
specific projects can be found-in three separate volumes prepared by the
Maintenance Planning Subdepartment of MOP (October 1990).

C. Financial Impact
1.          Since the project did not involve a revenue producing agency, no financial evaluation was
performed.
D. Studles
1.          Project coordination and supervision of major civil works as well as feasibility and engineering
studies and the construction of the long range pavement evaluation and design studies directed toward the
establishment of an adequate management system were all successfully completed by consultants at very
reasonable cost.
