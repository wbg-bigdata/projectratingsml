ROAD SECTOR PROJECT
I. PROJECT SUIMNARY
Borrower:      The Republic of Chile
Amount:         US$140 million equivalent
Terms:          Repayment in 15 years, including three years of grace, at the
standard variable interest rate.
Project
Executing
Agency:        Ministry of Public Works (Roads Directorate)
Description:   The proposed project consists of the Government's 1986-1988
Roads Investment and Maintenance Program. This program
includes construction; reconstruction; upgrading; routine,
periodic, and deferred maintenance; consulting and training
services and procurement of road maintenance equipment.
Beneficiaries: Project benefits will accrue to the economy at large in the
form of vehicle operating cost savings.
Risks:         There are no major risks affecting the proposed project. The
Roads Directorate's performance under the previous two
projects has been very good, and the Government has already
included the funds required for project implementation in its
current three-year plan.
Project Cost
and Financial
Plan:          The total cost of the Government's Roads Investment and
Maintenance Program for the 1986-1988 project period is
estimated at about US$656 million equivalent with a foreign
exchange component of about USS347 million equivalent. The
proposed Bank loan represents 21% of the total program and 40%
of the foreign exchange component. The balance of the foreign
exchange requirements will be financed by ongoing IDB loans,
an ongoing Bank loan, and a supplier credit to be arranged in
conjunction with this loan. The Government, will also finance
all local costs. Bank loan disbursements are targeted only
for expenditures under the maintenance program because of the
high rate of return of maintenance and in order to ensure its
timely execution.

II. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A. The Transport System and the Subsectors
2.01      The backbone of the Chilean transport system is Route Five, a
section of the Longitudinal Road which runs from the Peruvian border in the
North to Quellon on the island of Chiloe in the South. Over large sections
of its alignment, Route Five is paralleled by a railway. The system consists
further of a rather dense string of ports that can be used for national and
international shipping and a series of airports for local and international
air transport. Road transport carries about 662 of domestic freight, the
railways carry about 22%, coastal shipping about 7%, and oil pipelines about
4%. Air transport handles less than 1%. International goods traffic is more
than 90% by ship (exports about 98%). Passenger traffic is mainly by bus,
although 1.7 million railway tickets were sold in 1983 for an average trip of
170 km (up from 102 km in 1975).
(i) Railways
2.02      Chile has about 9,600 km of railways, of which about 6,000 km
(mainly the Southern Railway, the Santiago-Valparaiso and Calera-Los Andes
links of the Northern Railway, and the private Antofagasta-to-Bolivia
Railway) are 1.676 meter gauge. The rest (most of the Northern Railway) is
mainly 1 meter gauge. About 1,600 km are electrified, mainly in the South
and Santiago-Valparaiso/San Antonio, and about 700 km are continuous-welded.
Commercial goods :raffic by rail amounted to about 4.4 million tons in 1983,
over an average distance of about 281 km, compared with 3.9 million tons and
266 km in 1981.
2.03      In the early 1970s, the Chilean railways - overdesigned,
overstaffed and unable to eliminate uneconomic lines or to set adequate
rates - were covering, in some years, less than half of their total
expenditures, and Government contributions were well over US$100 million per
year. Since 1973, the railways have taken a set of measures to improve their
efficiency and to eliminate deficits. These successfully implemented
measures include: (a) phasing out of uneconomic and non-productive
services; (b) reductior of the labor force and rationalization of its use
(more than 27,000 people in 1973 and less than 8,000 in 1985); (c) partial
maintenance of the network and some equipment by private contractors,
resulting in reduced maintenance costs; (d) technological improvements,
mainly elimination of steam locomotion; and (e) tariff increases more than
doubling rates, in real terms, between 1971 and 1980.
2.04      As a result, Government financial assistance decreased steadily
after 1976 and has been almost unnecessary since 1980. However, the
long-term role of the railways has not yet been clearly defined, and the
process of trimming out non-productive lines does not appear to be complete,
particularly in the North.
(ii) Seaports and Airports
2.05      Chile has a coastline of more than 5,000 km, with more than 70
cargo port installations. The ten major Chilean seaports are state-owned and



- 4 -
are run by Empresa Porttiaria de Chile (EMPoRCHl); the remainder are
private, specialized (minerals and petrolpeum) anid general cargo ports.  Port
policy aims at encouraging port efficiency tlhrntigh competitinn among public
and private ports and, within ports, among terminal operators.  Port policy
was defined in the 1980s by three major new laws:
-  Law 18036 of Septemher 1981, establishing norms for port
workers, abolishing the prntected port workers register and
introducing three daily shifts of seven hours instead of the
previous two eight-hour shifts;
- Law 18040 of December 1981, modifying the Customs Ordinance to
simplify port procedures; and
- Law 18042 of October 1981, which was intended to establish a
National Ports Corporation (CNP) for the purpose of transforming
the ten existing EMPORCHI ports into individual public companies
(Sociedades Anonimas); this aspect of the law, however, was
never implemented; the law also expressly forbids port
authorities to handle, transport or store goods, since this work
was to be left to the private sector.
As a result of the changes of the first two laws, productivity increased,
costs declined and congestion was eliminated.
2.06      Apart from earthquake damage reconstruction needs in San Antonio
and Valparaiso, future investments in Chilean ports will mainly be for
changeover to new methods of goods handling, such as containerization, which
is proceeding at a rapid rate; and for efficiency improvements, such as
better access to the ports and to the f'.nal destination of the imported
goods. Only the rapidly growing wood products trade may require new capacity
investments in the Concepcion area, from which most wood is exported via the
port complex of San Vicente/Talcabuano.
2.07      Chile has an adequate network of airports, and three airports are
used for international flights. The Santiago International Airport has been
improved recently, but major expansion plans have been postponed since there
appears to be little urgent need for them.
(iii) State-Owned Maritime, Air Transport and Pipeline Companies
2.08      EMPREMAR, the state shipping company, and LANCHILE, the state-owned
airline, are not scheduled for privatization (for strategic reasons), but
would no longer receive Government subsidies, except for specifically
identified routes. They have been exposed completely to local competition in
national transport and to foreign competition in international transport,
since the Chilean Government gives all foreign and local companies access to
Chilean international ports and airports. EMPREMAR is operating
satisfactorily, but LANCHILE is in severe financial difficulties.
2.09      Chile's 622-km network of pipelines, which extends from Concon in
the center (Fifth Region) to Concepcion in the south (Eighth Region), belongs
to the Sociedad Nacional de Oleoductos (SONACOL), a company owned partly by
private interests and partly by the state-owned Empresa Nacional de Petroleo
(ENAP). The pipelines transport mainly gasoline, diesel and liquified



- 5 -
petroleum gas (LPG), but alsn many other petroleum products In lesser
quantities (some 300,000 cubhic meters per month in total).
(iv) The Road Subsector
2.10      The road network totals about 79,000 km, of which some 12.5%
(9,824 km) are paved, either with cement concrete (3,538 km) or with asphalt
(Table 2.1). Because of the country's long and narrow shape, the network is
dominated by three major stret:hes of North-South roads (4,459 km in total),
commonly referred to as the Longitudinal Road or Route Five (from the First
to the Tenth Region); the Austral Road between Puerto *'aras (North of Puerto
Montt in the Tenth Region) and Villa O'Higgins (at the foot of the
impenetrable perma frost area in the Eleventh Region); and, finally, Route
Nine in the Twelfth Region between Paso Bagueles on the Argentine border
north of Torres del Paine, and Fuerte Bulnes, south of Punta Arenas
(Table 2.2).
2.il      The longitudinal and the major transversal roads make up Chile's
National Roads or *-A roads (5,760 kn) which, together with the so-called
Regional Roads or "B' and *C  roads, constitute the Basic Network of
22,831 km (Table 2.1 and IBRD Map 18892). The country also has some 56,165
km of local roads or *D- and *-E roads (Principal and Secondary Local
Roads). IBRD Map 18893 shows the Basic Network and the Local Network of the
Northern Central Region.
2.12      Annual average daily traffic levels (AADT) on the main National
Roads, as measured at toll stations, are between 2,000 and 8,500 vehicles
(Table 2.3); they grew between 0.2% and 18.3% in the 1976-1981 period, but
declined by 3.4% and 11% in 1982 and 1983, respectively, to grow again by
2.4% in 1984. The declines are the combined effect of decreased production
and reduced use of passenger cars as a result of worsened economic
conditions.
2.13      Another interesting feature of Chilean road traffic is the changing
composition of vehicles in the makeup of traffic and the vehicle fleet. The
share of passenger cars in traffic increased from 60% in 1976 to 68% in
1982/83, whereas the share of two-axle trucks diminished from 22% in 1972/73
to only 9% in 1983. The share of trucks with three or more axles increased
from 5% to 13% in the same period (Table 2.3).
2.14      The registered motorized road vehicle fleet appears to have
increased very rapidly since 1976 and reached about 891,000 vehicles in 1983,
or about 76 vehicles per 1,000 inhabitants, versus less than half that many
in 1975 (Table 2.4). The registered truck fleet, which increased at a
similar rate as the whole fleet in 1976-1978, has since declined every year,
indicating bnth the degree of oversupply and the lack of demand for truck
services, in spite of depressed trucking rates.
2.15      Data on the vehicle fleet, however, continue to lack sufficient
detail, and it is hoped that they will be improved under the ongoing study of
the Institutional and Economic Efficiency of the Chilean Transport System,
given their importance in understanding the current market disequilibrium in
trucking (para 2.17).



-6-
B. Institutional Framework
2.16      Transport-policy-making in Chile is officially the task of the
Ministry of Transport and Telecommunications (MTT), which is in charge of all
modes, but the Ministry of Public Works (MOP) is in charge of all transport
infrastructure works and does road planning. It is also responsible for the
collection of tolls and the implementation of the vehicle weighing program,
but, for the latter two activities, it works in close collaboration with the
Police Force or -Carabineros.- The Planning Office (ODEPLAN) published a
broad, non-quantitative Socio-Economic Program for 1981-1989 and updates a
rolling three-year plan every year. It also checks whether proposed trans-
port investments are justified economically according to its guidelines for
analysis and whether they fit into the broad program. The weakest link in
this chain is MTT, which is severely understaffed, both quantitatively and
qualitatively, particularly in its Transport Planning Unit. Even in a
strictly market-oriented economy, the major function of data processing, to
facilitate knowledgeable operation of the market, should be performed
satisfactorily by this Ministry. A recently approved Public Sector
Management Technical Assistance Loan will address, inter alia, the linkages
between sector-policy formulation and management of the public enterprises in
the transport sector.
C. Main Sectoral Issues
2.17      Since taking power in 1973, the Government has actively introduced
measures to implement a market-oriented transport strategy. These measures
include: (a) eliminating all restrictions to entry into the road transport
industry; (b) attempting to eliminate all transport sector subsidies;
(c) charging air, land and maritime transport for the use of public
infrastructure; (d) decentralizing decision-making in each transport mode
regarding tariffs, design of services, and personnel policies; and
Ce) treating all modes equally in terms of taxes, social services, and such.
2.18      The Government had a certain amount of success with the imple-
mentation of its strategy, but was Got fully satisfied with the workings of
the competitive system. It therefore asked the Bank for assistance in
determining the major obstacles in the way of a better functioning transport
market in Chile. This request led to the formulation of a study of the
Institutional and Economic Efficiency of the Chilean Transport System, which
is presently under way with the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin
kmerica (ECLA) as executing agency, as well as an Intermodal Transport Study
of the Corridor Santiago-Ports of the Fifth Region. These studies are being
financed under Loan 2297-CH and are expected to be completed in early 1986.
2.19      The major sectoral issues being addressed by these studies are:
(a) the modal split in land transport and road user charges; (b) the effects
of complete deregulation of the trucking industry; (c) policy development in
the ports subsector; (d) the impact of subsidy reduction to LANCHILE; and
(e) the physical, institutional and organizational needs for rapid contain-
erization.
2.20     This proposed project will focus upon the following main issues in
the roads subsector: the balance between maintenance and new construction;
road maintenance personnel training; and road user charges and diesel
taxation.



-7-
(i) The Balance between Maintenance and New Construction
2.21      Road maintenance and road investment efforts have declined, in
dollar terms, from the levels reached in 1981, mainly because of economic
problems, declining goods traffic and rapid devaluation of the peso in
relation to the dollar since 1982 (Tables 2.5 and 2.6). However, in
recognition of the deteriorating conditions of the network (Annex 2,
Table 2), maintenance expenditures are expected to rise by 39%, in real
terms, In 1985 (Table 2.7). In the years of the project (1986-1988), they
are expected to rise further, in real terms, by as much as 62% in 1986, 13%
in 1987 and 17% in 1988, whereas investment expenditures are expected to
decline over the same period.
2.22      Substantial investments for reconstruction and upgrading nf main
roads and for major bridge rehabilitation and reconstruction are expected to
continue through 1985, but will drop off rapidly in 1986 through 1988 - the
project period - to make way for increasing maintenance expenditures.
Recently, however, the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) approved a
US$36 million loan to Chile for the construction of a major penetration road
in the Austral area of the country. This will increase construction
expenditures for this road, from an average of US$5 million per year in the
first three years of the 1980s and US$11.7 million in 1984, to an average of
US$14.6 million per year over the project period. This road, as evaluated by
IDB, has a satisfactory internal rate of return (IRR) with individual IRRs of
road sections, excluding time savings, ranging from 12.6% to 67%. However,
because of its long payback period, the road's priority needs to be closely
monitored, particularly in light of the current economic situation.
Nevertheless, the levels of road expenditures and the balance of the program
are still satisfactory. To prevent the trend toward new construction at the
expense of maintenance and rehabilitation from reappearing, agreement was
reached during negotiations upon the size and composition of the six-year
1986-1991 roads program (Table 2.7), which would be changed only with
approval of the Bank.
(ii) Road Maintenance Personnel Training
2.23      Although several attempts have been made in the past to establish a
sound personnel training program in HOP and MTT, training still appears to be
a neglected area in the transport sector. Until 1979, training in Vialidad
was carried out by: (a) an MOP-wide Training Institute, ITAO (Instituto
Tecnico de Adiestramiento de Operarios), for heavy machine operators,
drivers, welders and mechanical maintenance workers; and (b) a Training Unit
of Vialidad, oriented toward training for professional and administrative
personnel. However, because of policy changes and the reorganization of
Vialidad, both units were eliminated and training was assigned, as an
additional responsibility, to the Administrative Department of Vialidad,
which only coordinates courses planned by the Subsecretary of MOP.
2.24      Vialidad's management is aware that its personnel needs additional
training in order to employ more efficiently the work methods to be
introduced as part of the proposed Road Sector Project. Toward this end,
Vialidad's management is determined to establish a comprehensive training
program, aimed at strengtbening the technical skills of professional



personnel, as well as of road foremen, equipment operators and mechanics.
Since Vialidad's training section lacks experience, the training component
included in the proposed project would help to establish a suitable training
department capable of implementing the training activities required to
achieve the project's institutional and physical objectives (Annex 1).
(iii) Road User Charges and Diesel Taxation
2.25      Road vehicle fuel consumption, in spite of an increase in the
vehicle fleet by more than 10% per year during 1976-1982, increased by less
than 8% per year in that period. On the other hand, diesel consumption
increased faster than both gasoline consumption and the vehicle fleet
(Tables 2.4 and 2.8). Retail prices of automotive fuels cover, with a con-
siderable margin, the corresponding opportunity costs (international prices,
Table 2.9). As of December 1984, in the Santiago region, retail prices for
regular and premium gasoline were, on the average, about 432 above the
International or ex-refinery prices plus distribution charges and retailers'
margins, while diesel oil was retailing at some 20X above (Table 2.9).
2.26      Although revenues from road users have substantially exceeded the
Government's total road-related expenditures since the mid-1970s (Table 2.5),
a considerable cross-subsidization exists between gasoline-powered cars,
mainly for personal transport, and diesel-powered vehicles, mainly trucks and
buses, leading to inefficiencies in the road and rail traffic mix. The main
inequity occurs because an excise tax of 27% is levied upon the ex-refinery
price of gasoline in addition to the 20% value added tax levied upon the
retail price before taxes, while no such excise tax is levied on diesel. A
diesel fuel tax would be an efficient way to make the trucking industry pay a
larger share of the road construction and maintenance burden. The Government
is aware of the problem and was planning to implement corrective measures
progressively, following the recommendations of a road user charges study by
a local consulting firm. So far, it has not acted because of the acute
sensitivity of the nation's influential trucking industry regarding this
issue and the need to study the road/rail relationship anew.
2.27      The ECLA study on the Economic Efficiency of the Chilean Transport
system, which is expected to be completed in early 1986, is addressing the
issue of diesel pricing and road user charges in general in the broader
context of the current competitive situation in the land transport market.
During negotiations, agreement was reached on gradually correcting the retail
price of diesel fuel, taking into account the recommendations of the ongoing
ECLA study.
D. Bank Lending Strategy in the Sector
2.28      The present Chilean Government rapidly increased its reliance upon
the Bank in the sector to the point where it engages in frequent dialogue
with the Bank concerning the implementation of liberal market-oriented
transport policies. In addition, during the preparation of the Second



- 9 -
Highway Reconstruction project, emphasis in the dialogue with the Bank
shifted from road construction to maintenance. The Government is convinced
that Bank experience would contribute substantially toward introducing sound
preventive maintenance and pavement management.
2.29      The Bank has responded very favorably to this policy change and has
expanded its field of activity in Chile from highway reconstruction to road
maintenance and to studies of the whole transport system. These studies mav
lead to further Bank operations in other transport suhsectors, and are
already contributi-g significantly to sophisticated personnel training, not
only in the Roads Directorate but also in MTT.  It is Bark strategy to expand
and deepen this-cooperation (paras 2.17-2.19).
E. Exnerience with Past Bank Lending
2.30      The Bank has been involved in the road subsector in Chile since
1961, through five loans and a credit, totaling about USS219 million. The
Bank operations were for the construction, upgrading and rehabilitation of
more than 3,000 km of roads; the periodic maintenance of about 2,200 km of
roads; the preparation of feasibility and final engineering studies for more
than 1,500 km; and the building of road maintenance capacity through
technical assistance and procurement of maintenance and research equipment.
2.31      The First Highway Construction and Maintenance Project was financed
by Credit 4-CH for USSl9 million and Loan 287-C for USS6 million, both in
June 1961. The Second Highway Maintenance Project (Loan 558-CH for USS13.2
million in September 1968) and the Third Highway Project (Loan 668-CH for
USS10.8 million in June 1970) are the first two projects for which Project
Completion and Project Performance Audit Reports (PPAR) were issued (1979 and
1980 respectivelv). The objectives of these two projects were not fully
realized because of the effects of major changes in the economic, political
and social structure of the country, insufficiency of funds for recurrent
road expenditure and rampant inflation. The latest PPAR drew attention to
the need for selective organization strengthening, which was subsequently
addressed in the First and the Second Highway Reconstruction Projects.
2.32      With the First Highway Reconstruction Project (Loan 1927-CH for
US$42 million in April 1981), a new era in Bank relations with Chile
started. The main objective of the project was the reconstruction of about
250 km of Route Five, mainly south of Santiago (IDB was doing another 500
km). Execution of this loan progressed so well that disbursements were
completed on schedule in 1984, and compliance with the loan covenants
concerning implementation of axle load limit regulations and improvement of
road maintenance was exemplary. All planned weighing stations are in
operation, axle load limit violations have been reduced from about I0 of all
trucks to less than 0.5Z of all trucks, and several large private enterprises
have installed their own weighing stations.
2.33      Ihe Second Highway Reconstruction Project (Loan 2297-CH for US$128
million in August 1983) was approved to help MOP to continue the
reconstruction of 435 km of Route Five north of Santiago, and the
reconstruction and widening of about 411 km of main transversal roads. It
also helped Y,OP to start a major road maintenance effort of the Basic Network
by financing regraveling, surface dressing and overlays of about 2,200 km of
major roads; construction and rehabilitation of a series of 100 bridges
(including 60 km of access roads); and acquisition of road maintenance



- 10 -
equipment and pavement research and laboratory equipment, as well as
consulting services and training.
2.34      Physical project implementation is progressing very well and an
schedule, hut disbursements are lower than expected, because of lower-than-
expected project costs, due to the competitive construction marker and the
strength of the US dollar in relation to the Chilean peso. At the Covern-
ment's request, the Bank has allowed the Government to execute some emergency
works after a recent storm, and some extra maintenance and rehabilitation
works. With the new arrangements, about US$18 million, in cost savings, of
the USS128 million loan were expected to be canceled eventually. However, in
response to the recent earthquake in Chile, the Bank has amended the loan to
permit significant portions of the savings to be used for emergency repairs
for roads, bridges and ports. A further request to use some of the still
remaining funds for repair of a severely damaged diesel locomotive workshop
is still expected. Consulting services to identify and appraise this element
are being recruited.
III. THE ROADS DIRECTORATE'S INVESTMENT AND MAINTENARCE PROGRAM
AND THE PROJECT
A. Project Origin and Objectives
3.01      Since the mid-1970s, tne Chilean Government has been expanding
municipal responsibilities for services, including health, education and
ir.frastructure maintenance. Consequently, responsibility for the Local Road
Network (about 56,000 km) was to be turned over to the municipalities. The
Ministry of Public Works' Roads Directorate (MOP's Vialidad) would then have
remained responsible only for the maintenance of the Basic Road Network
(22,500 ka). However, measures to make village councils responsible for the
local network were never implemented, a; 3 Vialidad never completely
relinquished responsibility for the local network.
3.02      During transport sector work and the appraisal of an ongoing
highway reconstruction project (Loan 2297-CH of 1983), the Bank identified as
the major issues: (a) the need to provide more adequate funding and better
organization for maintenance of the basic highway network; and (b) the
uncertainty surround'ng the intended execution and financing of local road
maintenance by the municipalities. The first issue was partially resolved by
an adequate construction, reconstruction, rehabilitation and maintenance
program for the basic network for the period 1933-1989, whose implementation
was made a covenant of Loan 2297-CH.  To confront the second issue, a study
was commissioned to prepare a plan of action and to find adequate financing
for the maintenance of the local network.
3.03      Early in the study period, tne Government and MOP concluded that
the municipalities did not have equipment, personnel, or funds to perform
adequate maintenance of local roads, nor would they be able to acquire the
necessary means in the near future. Via.idad therefore started, in mid-1983,
pilot rural road maintenance programs in three southern provinces to
establish the extent of possible voluntacy contributions from the
municipalities for the execution of these programs.
3.04      Based upon the results of the pilot programs, Vialidad now feels,
and the Ministries of Interior and Finance agree, that it should



- 1i -
re-establish, as an objective, the assuming of full responsibility for most
of the road network; municipalities, lhowever, are still expected to
collaborate with Vialidad on easily accessible roads of purely local
interest. As a first step, Vialidad has prepared a program for the
rehabilitation and maintenance of the Primary Local Network (24,000 km),
including a lump sum of money for performing spot interventions on the
remaining, much less traveled 32,000 km of the local network (Secondary Local
Network) whenever traffic flows are seriously impeded.
3.05      Vialidad is capable of executing this expanded program (para 4.05)
and of helping to create an atmosphere of cooperation with the municipalities
for the spot maintenance of the remainder of the network. Vialidad is also
ready to help the Ministries of Finance and the Interior to redefine the
physical and financial role of the municipalities in maintenance of the
Secondary Local Network on the basis of experience under ongoing pilot pro]-
ects. During negotiations, it was agreed that Vialidad would prepare, by
December 31, 1986, a maintenance plan for secondary local roads satisfactory
to the Bank, including a redefinition of the physical and financial role of
the municipalities.
3.06      The main objective of the proposed project, i.e., to help the
Government, both institutionally and financially, with the execution of its
road reconstruction and rehabilitation program and with the re-establishment
of an effectively functioning road maintenance organization, is consistent
with national and sectoral objectives and priorities. Specifically, the
proposed project would help the Government to: (a) complete a major main road
reconstruction effort; (b) continue to improve the organization and execution
of overall maintenance for the remaining gravel roads in the basic road
nerwork; (c) re-establish a functional local road maintenance system with
improved technical execution; (d) improve Vialidad's competence in the
economic evaluation of road maintenance and rehabilitation activities;
(e) streamline the road maintenance efforts of municipalities through a study
of possible voluntary physical and financial contributions to the mai5-tenance
of the Secondary Local Network; and (f) strengthen the capability of
Viaiidad's Road Maintenance Directorate through a comprehensive training
program.
B. The Government's Roads Program 1985-1991
3.07     The Government's planned road expenditures for the 1985-1991 period
(Table 2.7) cover three years beyond the 1986-1988 project period. Another
operation in the additional three years would be necessary for further
consolidation of the substantially increased activity and expansion of the
maintenancp effort to the Secondary Local Network, which, under the proposed
project, would get only spot attention (para 3.04). The 1985-1991 period is
also the time during which the ongoing major reconstruction and deferred
maintenance efforts should be substantially completed. As far as construc-
tion is concerned, it is the period in which the Government plans to complete
the previously discussed Austral Road (para 2.22) and to complete,
particularly during 1989-1991, a major widening of the Santiago-Valparaiso
(including tunnels) and Santiago-San Antonio roads, leading to the most
important ports and summer tourism areas. All significant construction,
reconstruction and upgrading elements in the program, especially during the
next three years, are already included in ongoing Bank and IDB projects.



- 12 -
3.08      The Government's planned road expenditures are reasonably balanced
(paras 2.21 and 2.22). The economic justification of the Austral Road proj-
ect has been reviewed by IDB, which has approved Loan 490/0C-CH for US$36
million to finance Its construction. All major elements of the program are
subject to economic evaluation using a methodology developed by ODEPLAN,
whlch has been reviewed and found acceptable by the Bank. The only weakness
of the current ODEPLAN system Is that it does not include optimization
calculations of the program as a whole. This optimization has been done by
Vialidad and the Bank, mainly for the reconstruction and maintenance program,
and it is clear that rates of return for that program are higher than those
for individual construction projects. If, therefore, less than the required
financing were to be available from the Government, the maintenance program
would have to receive priority over the investment program, whose execution
would then have to be spaced over a longer time period. This was agreed
during negotiations.
C. The Project Cost and Financing
3.09     The proposed project consists of the Government's 1986-1988 Road
Investment and Maintenance Program. The total project cost, including about
20% identifiable taxes and duties, amounts to US$655.5 million with a foreign
exchange component of US$346.8 million. The foreign exchange component is
broken down into US$300.8 million of capital costs (87% of the total foreign
exchange cost) and US$46.0 million of recurrent costs. The proposed loan of
USS140 million would finance 40% of the foreign exchange cost of the
project. Financing from the ongoing project (Loan 2297-CH), ongoing IDB
loans and a supplier credit, to be arranged in conjunction with this project,
amounts to about US$114.5 million, bringing the total foreign financing to
USS254.5 million, which is less than the foreign exchange component of the
capital cost of the investment and maintenance program L1. This program is
detailed in Table 2.7 and summarized in the table on page 13. The maintenance
program, excluding several specific maintenance works financed under Loan
2297-CH and IDB Loan 490/OC-CH, has been selected for Bank loan disbursements
to ensure the timely execution of this high priority component (para 4.08).
3.10     For the estimation of the foreign exchange component (FEC) of civil
works, MOP has developed a computer program that establishes the FEC of each
construction or maintenance item and calculates the FEC for typical opera-
tions. The FEC for consulting services was estimated assuming that contracts
would normally be awarded to local firms with a limited participation of
foreign consultants (para 3.12). For goods to be procured under the project,
the FEC has been estimated at 65%, based upon the CIF prices at the port of
entry into Chile and payment by MOP of 25% import duties, 2% customs
clearance and port costs and 20% sales tax (totaling 53%).
3.11      Because of the sectoral approach of this project, no physical con-
tingencies have been considered. Price contingencies for 1986, 1987 and
1988, on the basis of March 1985 prices, assume internal and external price
increases of 5% for 1985, 7.5% for 1986 and 8% for 1987-1989 (MUV Index).
3.12      The cost estimates for civil works related to investments are based
upon quantity estimates and current unit prices. and are reasonable given the
standards proposed and the expected traffic. The cost estimates for civil
works related to maintenance were prepared by MOP based upor current costs
for such operations by force account and by contract, in distinct geographic
1/ 'B loan cofinancing may be considered.

regions of the country: the arid north with extreme daily temperature
variations, the temperate center with light rainfall and the cooler south
with heavy rainfall. Cost estimates for maintenance equipment and vehicles
have been prepared on the basis of MOP-supplied manufacturers' quotations and
custom duties, port costs and taxes to be paid by MOP. The cost for consult-
ing services has been estimated as shown in Table 3.1, assuming about 80
man-months for foreign consultants and 1,188 man-months for local
consultants, including 36 man-months for foreign lecturers and 12 man-months
for a local consultant for training organization and administration. The
cost of the training component has been estimated by detailed costing of all
elements (Annex 1, Table 4).
D. Project Components
(i) Investment
3.13     The investment component includes civil works and consultant
services. The civil works component comprises construction, reconstruction
and upgrading. Construction consists mainly of the Austral Road and some
widening or doubling of sections of major, heavily traveled roads, as well as
a one-lane road between Punta Arenas and Puerto Natales (Route Nine of the
Longitudinal Road), and a few new bridges and urban overpasses. Reconstruc-
tion is mainly the continuation of the major effort to reconstruct Route
Five, the main thoroughfare of the country, and major transversal roads.
Upgrading consists mainly of a program of paving major gravel roads with more
than 300 vehicles per day, some of them part of the basic network. Finally,
the consultant services component deals mainly with local consultants to
supervise the investment activities.
(ii) Maintenance
3.14      The maintenance components include civil works, equipment and
consultant services and training. The civil works comprise routine, periodic
and deferred maintenance. Routine maintenance of the Basic Network (22,500
km) and of the Primary Local Network (24,000 Im) includes:  (a) patching and
sealing of joints and cracks on cement concrete and asphalt paved roads;
(b) grading and spot regraveling of unpaved roads; (c) clearing and
maintenance of drainage ditches and structures; (d) maintenance of bridges
and river training structures; (e) maintenance of road signs, tunnels,
weighing and toll stations; and (f) snow removal on specific mountain roads.
On the remaining 32,000 km of the network (Secondary Local Network), which
will get neither regular routine nor periodic maintenance from the Roads
Directorate at this stage, voluntary municipal contributions will be
encouraged under the project. Kaintenance of the Secondary Local Network
includes only spot interventions whenever these roads become impassable
(para 3.04).
3.15      The periodic maintenance component will include: (a) resealing and
surface treatments or overlays of paved surfaces, both roadways and
shoulders; (b) regraveling of unpaved surfaces; and (c) repair of bridges and
of river training structures. Most surface treatment and overlay operations
are handled, at this time, under deferred maintenance; under the proposed
project, however, they will be increasingly integrated into the periodic
maintenance program.



- 15 -
3.16      The deferred maintenance component focuses upon bringing neglected
paved and unpaved roads back to normal maintenance standards. The main
activities included are: (a) resealing and surface treatments or overlays of
paved surfaces; (b) patching and regraveling of unpaved surfaces; (c) paving
cf gravel roads with high traffic levels (surface treatments for roads above
300 vehicles per day and overlays for roads above 1,000); and (d) rehabili-
tation or reconstruction of drainage structures, including bridges, and of
river training structures.
3.17      The equipment component includes procurement of road maintenance
equipment and vehicles to replace wornout units and to increase the stock of
equipment to handle a larger network.  The equipment will serve to execute
the limited force account operations included in the road maintenance program
and the vehicles will be used for project supervision. The tentative list of
equipment to be purchased (Ta:lIc 3.2) and its procurement schedule
(Table 3.3) were agreed upon at negotiations.
3.18      The consulting services component includes professional services
for: (a) project coordination; (b) engineering studies; (c) supervision of
major civil works; (d) continuation of the long range pavement evaluation and
design studies directed toward the establishment of an adequate management
system, initiated under the Second Highway Reconstruction Project
(Loan 2297-CH); (e) training; and (f) other feasibIlity and engineering
studies to prepare a possihle future project (Table 3.1).
3.19      Finally, the training component will consist of the implementation
of a series of coordinated measures to upgrade the maintenance capability of
Vialidad, including:
(a)  training of about 2,000 technical and administrative employees,
emphasizing hands-on production training (Annex 1, Table 1);
(b)  provision of technical assistance in:  (i) pavement followup and
condition monitoring; (ii) road maintenance administration;
(iii) surface treatment; (iv) planning; (v) equipment administra-
tion; and (vi) organization and administration of training programs
(Annex 1, Table 2).
3.20      Vialidad's training program is primarily addressed to mechanics,
assistants, equipment operators, road foremen, professional storekeepers and
accountants and administrative personnel. The enrollment by function is
projected in Annex 1, Table 1. The training program includes about 150
courses and seminars with an average duration of about 50 hours. It is
expected that about 70Z of these courses will be contracted with local train-
ing institutions, such as Instituto Nacional de Capacitacion Profesional
(INACAP), the Chamber of Construction Industries, and universities. However,
in all cases, course contents will be defined by Vialidad's technical
specialists.
3-21      To carry out the training program, the project would further
provide: (a) fellowships abroad, of one to three months duration, for about
27 Vialidad professionals, including the regional and provinc*al chiefs
(Annex 1, Table 3); (b) exchange of experiences among the regions through
internal tours of about one week duration for about 46 professionals; and



- 16 -
(c) 48 staff-months of expert and consultant services, of which 36 staff-
months should be for expatriate technical advisors and 12 staff-months should
be for local advisors (Table 3.1 and Annex 1, Table 2).
3.22      Training of road foremen, drivers and heavy equipment operators
would be carried out mostly in the field. Thus, trainees would learn under
real working conditions while performing needed maintenance rehabilitation
works on specific sections of roads. Training of mechanics would be carried
out in the regional workshops through practical courses using and repairing
worn and unserviceable equipment. Experienced personnel would be trained in
pedagogical matters to perform as part-time instructors under the supervision
of the local training coordinators. Short technical seminars would be
conducted for maintenance engineers, equipment supervisors, storekeepers and
accountants, and foremen and administrative personnel, both in Santiago and
in the regions.
3.23      A training advisory committee, staffed by the heads of key depart-
ments of Vialidad and led by the deputy director, was appointed during
project preparation. The recommendations of this committee served as basis
for the preparation of the present report. An external consulting firm was
hired in January 1985 to provide technical assistance in: (a) assessing
training needs at the national level; (b) organizing the Training Unit;
(c) preparing a detailed three-year training plan; (d) defining course
contents; (e) assessing instructors' requirements; (f) preparing detailed
fellowship and technical assistance programs; (g) assigning training
personnel to the training unit; (h) preparing lists and specifications of
training materials, learning aids and equipment needed; and (i) determining
specific training costs and evaluation systems.
3.24      At negotiations, the Government confirmed that, by November 30,
1985, it would furnish to the Bank a plan of action satisfactory to the
Bank, to carry out the Training Program and that, no later than December 31,
1985, it would establish and staff the national training organization for the
road subsector - comprising the headquarters Training Unit, regional
coordinators and training advisory committees. The plan of action would
include the Terms of Reference for contracting training services (para 4.15).
E. Economic Evaluation
3.25      The economic evaluation of this project was performed in two
phases. In a first phase, the whole network of the country was evaluated by
Vialidad, using the Second Generation Highway Design and Maintenance
Standards Model (HDM II). This evaluation resulted in internal rates of
return (IRR) of selected construction, reconstruction, upgrading and mainte-
nance activities. On the basis of the thus obtained IRRs, an investment and
maintenance program for the period 1985-1991 was prepared. Most of the
investments in that program for the project period 1986-1988 are included in
ongoing Bank and IDB projects. The IRRs in the investment program range
between 15 and 38%. Detailed information is in the Project file (Annex 5).
3.26      Because of the high rates of return obtained on maintenance
activities, it was decided that further economic evaluation should
concentrate upon expanding and optimizing the Government's road maintenance
effort. In the second phase, the Bank's new Third Generation Highway Design
and Maintenance Model (HDM III) was used. This model predicts the life-cycle



- 17 -
cosLs of different road design and maintpnance options, including different
time-staging strategies, either for a given road project on a specific
alignment or for groups or links of an entire road network. It estimates the
total costs for large numbers of alternative maintenance policies on a
year-by-year basis, and can thus be used to search for the alternative with
the highest net present value (NPV) at given discount rates, or the highest
IRR. The objective is, thus, to search out that combination of standards and
policies which results in the minimum total life-cycle costs to society,
including the costs to road users, as well as the costs borne by the Highway
Authority. Vehicle speeds and operating costs, and road deterioration and
maintenance costs, are estimated internally by the model as a function of the
road design and maintenance standards, traffic volume and axle loads, and
environmental conditions. Maintenance and vehicle operating costs are first
estimated in physical quantities; then, prices and unit costs, as specified
by the user, are applied to determine the total financial, economic and
foreign exchange cost.
3.27     Twenty-seven maintenance policies were evaluated for each link of
paved roads and 31 for gravel and earth roads. The evaluation for each link
was done on the basis of the NPV and of the IRR, first assuming no budgetary
constraints and later taking into account the available budgets for the
project period. The details of the optimization process are shown in
Annex 2.  The IRR of the program on asphalt roads is about 49%, and, on the
gravel and earth roads, it is over 10OZ. The analysis also shows that, with
the proposed expenditure level, the Government will move rather close to an
economic optimum in maintenance.
F. Risk Assessment
3.28      There are no major risks affecting the proposed project.
Vialidad's performance under the last two projects has been very good.
Loan 1927-CH was completed on schedule and Loan 2297-CH is on schedule as far
as the physical execution of works is concerned. There may be some
uncertainty regarding the availability of counterpart funds and the capacity
of Vialidad to execute planned works and contracts without staff increases.
The second factor will be monitored closely. As far as the first is con-
cerned, the Governmer.t attaches high priority to the implementation of the
project, partly in the framework of a broader objective of employment
generation. The Government has already included the funds required for the
project in its current three-year plan and has officially agreed to provide
the funds as required by planned expenditures of Table 2.7 or as modified
from time to time in agreement with the Bank. This arrangement was confirmed
at negotiations.
IV. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A. The Investment and Maintenance Programs
4.01      All of the subprojects included in the 1986 investment program have
been subjected to economic evaluation and show satisfactory IRRs. The
program was officially agreed upon during negotiations. Most of the
subprojects are being financed under the ongoing project (Loan 2297-CH) or
IDB loans. Investment levels for 1987 and 1988 have been agreed, and
potential new subprojects have been identified. The detailed program for
each year will be developed by the Government in accordance with agreed upon
procedures and will be reviewed by the Bank annually (para 4.24).



- 18 -
4.02      The maintenance program for asphalt paved, gravel and earth roads
has been optimized using the IIDM III model (Annex 2, Table 8). A detailed
program for 1986 and tentative programs for 1987 and 1988 were agreed during
negotiations. These programs will be adjusted annually on the basis of more
up-tn-date information, results of research and measurements carried out with
new equipment purchased under Loan 2297-CH and experience gained in executing
the previous year's program. They will be discussed and agreed with the Bank
during the semi-annual project review meetings (para 4.24).
4.03      Routine maintenance programs for cement-concrete roads, bridges,
and signalization have been developed, based upon current MOP experience and
they take existing budgetary constraints into consideration. These programs
have been included in the annual programs and will be reviewed and adjusted
annually.
4.04      Summary information on the technical and economic evaluation of the
major subprojects included in the investment and maintenance program will be
prepared by Vialidad, following guidelines prepared by ODEPLAN. These guide-
lines have been reviewed by the Bank and found satisfactory. The summary
forms contain information on the rationale for the proposed works, definition
of the design standards, the alternatives considered, the costs, and the
results of the economic evaluation. This information will be reviewed by the
Bank in the course of the semi-annual review meetings (para 4.24).
B. Project Execution and Procurement
4.05      Execution of the project would be the responsibility of MOP's
Roads Directorate (Vialidad), which has a central and regional staff of about
4,000, of which some 150 are engineers and a further 50 are other categories
of professionals. It is a policy of the Government and of Vialidad to keep
the staff as small as possible, to execute as much work as possible by
contract, and to hire consultants or temporary contract workers to handle
overflow of work. Vialidad's organization is shown on Chart 1. It comprises
mainly the Departments for Studies, Construction, Bridges, Urban Roads, River
Training Structures, Laboratory, Maintenance Operations, and Administration,
and is adequate for the execution of the investment elements of the project.
Execution of the maintenance elements of the project would be the responsi-
bility of the Maintenance Department, which is presently being reorganized
and strengthened in preparation for the expected increased obligations
(Annex 3). Actual execution of the maintenance works would be the
responsibility of Vialidad's 13 regional offices, closely monitored by the
Maintenance Department.
4.06      The Maintenance Department is being organized into four sub-
departments: (a) the Maintenance Planning Subdepartment (created in May 1982
under Loan 1927-CH) has carried out the preparation of the proposed project
and is responsible for maintenance inventory, medium and long range planning,
estimates of work quantities, frequencies of operations and costs, priority
of works, estimates of needed revenues, and programing of works; (b) the
Normative Subdepartment studies and determines maintenance techniques,
technical specifications and contracting procedures; (c) the recently created
Executive Subdepartment will implement the work programs, allocate funds and
resources, monitor implementation of the program and actual operational
costs, manage financial aspects of the program, prepare disbursement applica-
tions and coordinate training; and (d) the Services Subdepartment handles
procurement of goods and equipment maintenance.



- 19 -
4.07      The organization of a typical regional office, represented on
Chart 2, comprises: (a) the Administration Department; (b) the Force Account
Maintenance Department, including a Subdepartment for equipment and workshops
administration; and (c) the Civil Works Contracts Department, whichi is in
charge of execution of construction and maintenance works by contract. The
line of responsibilities reaches, through these Departments, further down to
the Provincial Delegates and is divided again below this level into force
account and contract operations. The force account operations, which corres-
pond mostly to routine maintenance, are carried out by maintenance crews,
each responsible for routine maintenance of about 200 km of road. The
typical crew is composed of a foreman, a driver and four to six laborers,
supported permanently by a truck and auxiliary equipment, and occasionally by
heavier equipment, according to needs. The regional workshops carry out pre-
ventive maintenance and minor repairs. Vialidad's central workshop carries
out some major repairs; however, most major repairs are carried out mainly by
contracts with private garages and equipment dealers (Annex 3, para 10).
4.08      The general procurement information for the project (the
Government's 1986-1988 Roads Investment and Maintenance Program amounting to
US$655.5 million, including contingencies), is shown in Table 4.1. Because of
the high rate of return on maintenance, and to ensure its execution, even
when sufficient local funds for the whole roads program might not become
available, the maintenance component of about US$362.0 million has been
selected for Bank loan disbursements (paras 3.09 and 4.20). The maintenance
component includes equipment procurement for about US$8.1 million financed
under Loan 2297-CH and for about US$20.4 million under cofinancing arrange-
ments (para 4.14). It also includes several specific maintenance works which
are already financed under Loan 2297-CH (about US$49.0 million) and under IDB
Loan 490/OC-CH (about US$3.8 million). The list of these specific works was
confirmed at negotiations, and the corresponding expenditures would not be
eligible for financing under the proposed loan.
4.09      Procurement of Bank-financed project components would be in
accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement (August 1984). In
1980, MOP modified its traditional civil works tendering and contracting
system, to make it more cost-effective, by shifting to the contractor most of
the responsibility for work quantities and for financing and execution of
works. This move implied several departures from Bank Guidelines, but,
during negotiations (April 1983) and project implementation of Loan 2297-CH,
MOP gradually eliminated the disc epancies, mainly by:  (a) reverting respon-
sibility for engineering to MOP; (b) reinstating the possibility to grant an
advance payment of 20% and to provide again for monthly payments; and
(c) eliminating automatic disqualification of all bids more than 202 above or
below the official estimate. Procurement was, thus, brought back completely
in accordance with Bank Guidelines and has been used successfully so far in
the award of 40 contracts for about US$88 million under Loan 2297-CH. The
bidding documents and procedures used successfully under Loan 2297-CH would
be used in the implementation of the proposed loan, which would finance about
US$272.0 million procurement (Table 4.1).
4.10      About 65% of routine maintenance, representing some US$59 million,
including contingencies, would be executed by force account, comprising
operations for which studies have indicated that, under given circumstances,
force account is more economical than contracting. These force account
operations represent 22% of the project cost to be financed under the



- 2u -
proposed loan, 18Z of the total cost of maintenance civil works (Table 4.2)
and 9Z of total project cost.  During project implemientation, MOP would
improve its contracting proceduires for routine maintenance, and force accouint
work wotuld not increase in the future. The efficiency of force account
operations would he monitored closely during project supervision (Annex 4).
4.11       Despite the high amount of expendittures to be made throu1gh con-
tracting under the maintenance program, the nature and individual size of the
programed civil works would not elicit participation by foreign contractors.
It is expected that less than eight civil works contracts would have an
estimated cost above US$2.0 million, with a combined cost oF about
US$20.0 million, representing less than 8% of the maintenance works to be
contracted. Moreover, these few larger contracts are scattered throughout
the country, and their execution would be spread over the three years,
preventing then from being packaged to attract foreign competition. In
addition, there would be about 240 contracts for surface treatments, overlays
or bridge works with an average individual cost of about US$350,000 and
about 1,000 small contracts for other maintenance works with an average
individual cost of about US$100,000. These contracts would be packaged for
tendering into groups of a homogeneous nature. Nevertheless, the size of
these contracts and their distribution in space and time still would not make
the resulting packages larger than US$2.0 million. Agreements on tender
packaging and scheduling were reached at negotiations.
4.12       Considering the above-explained circumstances, the capacity and
competitiveness of the local construction industry, and the experience under
the two recent highway reconstruction projects (Loans 1927-CH and 2297-CH),
it is not likely that foreign contractors would show an active interest in
participating in tendering. Therefore, most contracts are expected to be won
by local contractors. Nevertheless, contracts for civil works estimated to
cost US$2.0 million or more, or packages of smaller contracts with a combined
cost of about US$2.0 million, would be awarded through international
competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's guidelines for
procurement. Contracts estimated to cost less than US$2.0 million, or
packages having a combined cost below this threshold, would be awarded
following local competitive bidding (LCB) procedures, which are in any case
open to foreign bidders. LCB procedures were reviewed in detail and found to
be satisfactory. Bidding and contracting procedures were agreed at
negotiations.
4.13       Prequalification of contractors for ICB, as well as for LCB, would
be based upon HOP's permanent register of contractors, which groups contract-
ors according to different types of works and into five categories according
to their financial and executive capability. Foreign contractors are
permitted to register individually or in joint venture with local firms. The
register is updated continuously, has been used successfully for more than 30
years, and is satisfactory to the Bank. For foreign contractors, invitations
to prequalify are sent to Embassies and published in the Development
Forumi. In addition, notices of specific ICB tenders would be advertised
locally and sent to Embassies. The Bank would be kept informed concerning
the list of prequalified foreign contractors, those refused prequalification,
if any, and the reason therefor.



- 21 -
4.14       Parallel cofinancing for equipment with a CIF cost of about
US$13.5 million, incliiding contingencies, would be sought. The Government
would Invite for tenders according to either one of two options acceptahle to
the Bank: (a) prospective bidders would be informed that the Government is
arranging bilateral export financing; or (b) prospective bidders would he
requested to include offers of financing with their bids. The former
alternative should he pursued if there is sufficient evidence regarding the
availability of bilateral export credit. Initial discussions with three
prospective bilateral export agencies have indicated good probabilities for
cofinancing arrangements. Should financing be required at a later stage, the
program and financing plan would be adjusted accordingly. The implementation
schedule for goods procurement was agreed upon during negotiations
(Table 3.3).
4.15      Terms of reference for procurement of consulting services for proj-
ect coordination, for engineering and for supervision of civil works would be
similar to those under Loan 2297-CH. Terms of reference for the contracting
of training services and for special studies would be agreed with the Bank
before calling for bids. These consulting services would be contracted in
accordance with the relevant Bank guidelines, dated August 1981.
C.   Tender Process and Bank Review of Contracts
4.16      The Bank has a long and excellent experience with MOP's tender
procedures, and a set of standard bidding documents and model contracts were
reviewed and approved under Loan 2297-CH. Therefore, once a subproject has
been declared eligible, MOP would tender and award contracts subject to
ex-post review by the Bank. The time allowed for preparation of bids would
be 45 days for tenders having an estimated contract amount above
US$2.0 million equivalent, 30 days for those between US$0.2 and
US$2.0 million, and 15 days for smaller maintenance contracts.
4.17       After the signature of each contract having a cost of US$2.0
million or more, MOP would send to the Bank two conformed copies of the con-
tract, together with the tender evaluation report indicating the award
decision. The Bank would review this information and, if satisfied,
indicate no objection, thereby declaring the specific contract accepted;
otherwise, it would request further information. A copy of each contract
costing less than US$2.0 million, together with the tender evaluation
indicating the award decision, would he filed by MOP, to be made available
for random review by project supervision missions. If either one of the
reviews would show that, in a specific case, agreed tender procedures were
not followed, the Bank would have the right to reject the contract and to
cancel the related loan amount.
D.   Disbursements and Special Account
4.18      The execution of the extensive road maintenance program would
require disbursements against a great number of small contracts and against
some routine maintenance works carried out by force account. The total
volume of individual disbursement operations would seriously strain MOP's and
the Bank's capabilities to handle then in the traditional way. Considering
MOP's proven adequate contracting and payment procedures and its capacity for
swift and effective work execution, simple and quick disbursement procedures



- 22 -
would be used. Withdrawal applications would be on the basis of monthly
statements of expenditures for the execution of the different components of
the agreed specific Maintenance Program. The monthly statements would
comprise expenditures for works executed by contract and for routine mainte-
nance executed by force account. The latter would be determined by
multiplying the real physical production measurement times the unit costs for
each operation (Annex 2, Table 3), to be updated from time to time. The
preparation of the monthly statements of expenditures and the monitoring of
project work would be carried out by Vialidad's Maintenance Department with
appropriate consultant asststance provided under the loan. These arrange-
ments were confirmed at negotiations. Supporting documentation would not be
submitted to the Bank, but would be retained by MOP and made available for
review during project supervision missions and audits.
4.19      In order to reduce the interval during which MOP would finance the
Bank's share of project costs with its own resources, the Government might
request the Bank to make advance payments from the loan account into a
Special Account, to be opened in US dollars in the Central Bank, and which
would be available for reimbursing MOP for the Bank's share of the project
cost. The total amount in the Special Account would not exceed US$12.0 mil-
lion as the amount required for about four months of project execution. MOP
would be entitled to make monthly withdrawals from the Special Account, in
pesos or in foreign currencies, at the exchange rate applicable on the day
the Special Account is debited. The Bank would replenish the Special Account
for the amount of withdrawals for eligible expenses at the request of the
Borrower.
4.20      Bank loan disbursements would be made against the maintenance
component of the Vialidad program. The following categories would be
eligible for withdrawal from the Special Account:
(a)   50% of total expenditures for civil works under the maintenance
program, except for works financed under IBRD Loan 2297-CH and
IDB Loan 490/OC-CH, and
(b)   1002 of foreign expenditures for expatriate consultants and
training fellowships abroad and 50% of total expenditures for local
consultants and for the training component.
4.21      Standard disbursement profiles prepared by the Bank in the LAC
region indicate that a seven-year period is required to obtain full disburse-
ment of a standard project loan, but this is not appropriate for the proposed
sector project. The First Highway Reconstruction Project in Chile,
Loan 1927-CH, will be fully disbursed within six months after the original
Closing Date of December 31, 1984. The ongoing Second Highway
Reconstruction Project Loan (2297-CH) is expected to be fully disbursed one
year after the original completion date because of the inclusion of
additional emergency works in the project scope. Therefore, it can be safely
assumed that full disbursement of the proposed project would be achieved
within six months after the end of the programed three-year execution period
(Table 4.3). Preparations for timely initiation of project execution are
well advanced.



- 23 -
E. Auditing
4.22      It was agreed that the Contraloria General de la Republica de Chile
as independent auditor would: (a) consistently apply procedures and methods
satisfactory to the Bank that conform to generally accepted auditing
standards; (b) carry out its auditing vork in a timely manner (annual reports
would be presented not later than four months after the end of each calendar
year); and (c) maintain an independent character in its auditing role.
F. Monitoring of the Project
4.23      With regard to the monitoring of the project, Vialidad would
prepare quarterly reports fe- the Bank (Annex 4) providing information on its
road expenditures and, more particularly, on its maintenance and investment
budget, including a breakdown by category of expenditures and by force
account and contract. Force account expenditures should be further broken
down by their cost components; unit costs by force account and by contract
should be compared; productivity of force account operations should be
assessed; and lengths of roads being maintained and level of maintenance
should be documented, as vell as compliance with agreed project
implementation targets, status of selection and execution of deferred
maintenance subprojects, and general evaluations of the condition of the
network and of the maintenance programs. The disbursement schedule would be
reviewed and recommendations made for eventual modifications of the programs
and of the reporting requirements.
4.24      Furthermore, in order to monitor progress of the objectives of the
Sector Project, it was agreed at negotiations that the Government would, at
least semi-annually, meet with representatives of the Bank to discuss and
reach pertinent agreements on the following matters:
(a) During the first semester of each year, review of the results of
the previous year's program:
- summary of financial implementation of the Road Investment and
Maintenance Program;
- level of completion of road works in the investment program;
- level of completion of the maintenance program;
- economic evaluation of subprojects included in the investment and
in the maintenance programs;
- implementation of the training component;
- use of consulting services;
- review of audit reports and consolidation of disbursements against
actual expenditures;
- comparison of projected and actual loan disbursements; and
- other lessons iearned during implementation.



- 24 -
(b) During the second semester of each year, review of the program for
the next year, on the basis of lessons learned in the previous year:
- updated medium-term road investment program and objectives;
- proposed investment and maintenance budget;
- status of selection of Bank-financed subprojects;
- budget of funds for consulting services and for training;
- road condition inventories and review of the maintenance programs;
and
- review of the proposed disbursement schedule.
V. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
5.01      During negotiations, agreements on the following issues were
formalized:
(Wa  size and composition of the six year 1986-1991 roads program which
would be changed only with prior approval of the Bank (para 2.22);
(b)  gradually correct the retail price of diesel fuel, taking into
account the recommendations of the ongoing ECLA study and starcing
uot later than one year after completion of the study (para 2.27);
(c)  preparation, by December 31, 1986, of a maintenance plan for
secondary local roads satisfactory to the Bank (para 3.05);
(d)  list of equipment and procurement schedule (paras 3.17 and 4.14);
(e)  the preparation, by November 30, 1985, of a plan of action,
satisfactory to the Bank, to carry out the Training Program and the
establishment and staffing, not later than December 31, 1985, of
the national training or-anization for the road subsector
(para 3.24);
(f)  the Government to provide the funds as required for planned
expenditures (para 3.28);
(g)  the detailed roads program for 1986, including list of maintenance
works financed under other loans (paras 4.01, 4.02, 4.03 and 4.08);



- 25 -
(h) tender packaging and scheduling (para 4.11);
(i) bidding and contracting procedures (para 4.12);
(j) disbursement arrangements (para 4.18); and
(1) scope of the reporting requirements (paras 4.23 and 4.24).
5.02      Subject to the above, the proposed project would be suitable for a
Bank loan of USS140 million, with a term of 15 years, including a grace
period of three years, at the standard variable interest rate.

ROAD SECTOR PROJECT
Training Component
I. Road Personnel Training
1.01      Although several attempts have been made in the past to establish a
sound training program, training still appears to be a neglected area in the
road subsector. Until 1979, training was carried out by: (a) a Training
Institute (ITAO 1/) for training equipment operators, drivers, welders and
mechanic maintenance workers; and (b) the Training Unit of Vialidad, oriented
to provide training for professional and administrative personnel. However,
because of policy changes and reorganization of Vialidad, both units were
eliminated and training was assigned as an additional duty to the
Administrative Department of Vialidad. The current role of Vialidad's
Administrative Department is only to coordinate courses planned by the
Subsecretary of the Ministry of Public Works. In 1984, the plan for the
overall ministry included seven seminars in technical areas and six courses
in administration areas respectively. Under this arrangement, about 45
members of Vialidad received courses in 1984 which, to a large extent, were
not road-specific. In addition, another 280 members of Vialidad's personnel
attended one- to two-hour conferences, mainly in safety and hygiene subjects.
1.02      Vialidad authorities are aware that, among others, one of the
existing deficiencies in road maintenance is the lack of technical skills of
maintenance personnel at all levels. Therefore, Vialidad personnel need
additional training to enable them to employ, more efficiently, work methods
which are to be introduced as a part of the proposed road sector project. To
do so, Vialidad authorities are determined to establish a comprehensive
training program, oriented toward strengthening technical skills of senior
personnel, as well as of road foremen, equipment operators and mechanics.
Since the Vialidad training section lacks experience and power, the training
component included in the proposed project would help to establish a suitable
training department capable of implementing the training activities required
to achieve the project's institutional and physical objectives.
II. The Project's Training Component Objectives and Description
A. ObJectives
2.01      The major objectives of the project's training component are to:
1/ ITAO - Instituto Tecnico de Adiestramiento de Operarios.



- 42 -
ANNEX 1
Page 2 of 4
(a) strengthen Vialidad's road maintenance activities through a
comprehensive training program which includes (i) upgrading of
about 2,000 technical and administrative personnel; (ii) fellow-
ships abroad for ;bout 27 Vialidad professionals; and (iii)
internal tours for about 46 professionals; and
(b) establish a national structure for training of Vialidad personnel,
Including (i) the headquarters training unit; (ii) the regional
coordinators; and (iii) the training advisory committees.
B. Description
2.02      Vialidad's three-year (1986-1988) training program is primarily
addressed to road foremen, equipment operators, mechanics, storekeepers,
accountants and administrative personnel. The program is aimed at some 2,000
persons. The enrollment by function is projected as follows: (i) mainte-
nance - 1,700 people; (ii) administration - 210 people; (iii) planning and
studies - 20 people; (iv) bridges - 40 people; and (v) construction and
laboratories - 20 people. The training program includes about 150 courses
and seminars with an average duration of about 50 hours. It is expected that
about 70% of these courses would be contracted with external training
institutions, such as INACAP2/, the Chamber of the Construction Industries,
and the universities. However, in all cases, course contents would be
defined by Vialidad's technical specialists. Training of road foremen,
drivers and heavy equipment operators would be carried out mostly in the
field. Thus, trainees would learn under real working conditions while
performing needed maintenance or pavement rehabilitation works on specific
sections of the roads. Training of mechanics would be carried out in the
regional workshops through practical courses using and repairing worn and
unserviceable equipment. Short technical seminars would be conducted for
maintenance engineers, equipment supervisors, storekeeper accountants,
foremen and administrative personnel, both in Santiago and in the regions.
Table 1 of this annex gives the number of personnel, by level and function,
to be trained.
III. Organization and Implementation of the Training Program
A. Training Facilities and Equipment
3.01      Training equipment and material such as workshop equipment and
tools, spare parts, used heavy equipment and audio-visual training aids would
be provided to facilitate the training process. Limited physical training
facilities such as a classroom and workshop would be improved or remodeled in
order to provide a basic infrastructure for training in selected regions.
2/ INACAP - Instituto Nacional de Capacitacion.

Page 3 of 4
B. Technical Assistance
3.02      The three-year training program would require 48 man-months of
technical assistance, of which 36 man-months should be expatriate technical
advisors and 12 man-months should be local advisors in planning, organization
and administration of training programs. Vialidad would assign counterpart
personnel to the technical specialists, and project unit personnel would be
counterparts of the training specialists. Outline terms or reference for
these services are given in Attachment 1, and the Summary of Technical
Assistance requirements is presented in Table 2 of this annex.
C. Fellowships
3.03      Fellowships of one to three months duration would be organized
abroad for about 27 Vialidad professionals, including the regional and
provincial chiefs. These fellowships would total about 54 staff-months and
would permit Vialidad senior staff to be upgraded by attending courses and
seminars and visiting selected countries. A summary of fellowship
requirements is shown in Table 3 of this annex.
D.  Preparation of the Training Program
3.04      At the time of project appraisal, an external consulting firm was
hired to provide technical assistance in: (a) assessing training needs at
national level; (b) organizing the Training Unit; (c) preparing a detailed
three-year training plan; (d) defining course contents; (e) assessing
instructors' requirements; (f) preparing detailed fellowship and technical
assistance programs; (g) training personnel assigned to the training unit;
(h) preparing lists and specifications of training material, learning aids
and equipment; and (i) determining specific training costs and evaluation
systems.
E. Course Content
3.05      The course content would be defined through occupational analysis
in order to reflect the specific training requirement of each maintenance
occupation. The occupational analysis would be a basis for preparation of
syllabi for the different training courses.
F. Instructors
3.06      The execution of the training program would require five full-time
instructors recruited from Vialidad senior technical staff or from the
private sector. In addition, experienced personnel of Vialidad would perform
as part-time instructors in specific technical subjects. Both full-time and
part-time instructors would be trained by external sources in pedagogical
matters and training methodologies.

ANNEX 1
Page 4 of 4
G. Internal Tours
3.07      To facilitate the exchange of experiences among regions, internal
tours of about one week duration should be arranged for about 46
professionals.
H. The Training Unit
3.08      The program would include the establishing and staffing, by
August 15, 1985, of the Training Unit to ensure adequate management and
coordination of the training activities. The training unit would be under
Vialidad's Deputy Director and would be led by a qualified engineer with at
least three years of experience in road maintenance. The Training Unit
would: (a) coordinate and monitor the implementation of the training
programs; (b) establish the agreements with training institutions; (c) admin-
ister the external technical assistance; (d) administer the fellowship
program for courses abroad; and (e) evaluate the results of the training
programs.
I. Traiuing Advisory Committee
3.09      A training advisory coLmittee, staffed by the heads of key depart-
ments of Vialidad and led by Vialided's Deputy Director, was appointed in
September 1984. This committee's main task is to advise the Deputy Director
in matters such as training strategy, policy priorities and organization. In
addition, as a part of the national structure for training, regional
committees and training coordinators would be appointed to carry out training
activities in the region.
J. Studies
3.10      Under the project training component, Vialidad would carry out
studies to define the skills and knowledge required by all maintenance
occupations. The project would also finance the preparation of a job des-
cription manual for all Vialidad personuel categories as well as specific
studies to evaluate results of the training program.
IV. Cost of the Training Component
4.01      The total cost of the training component is estimated at US$2.0
million. The estimated foreign exchange component is 1.02 million, repre-
senting about 50X of the total project cost. Detailed costs are shown in
Table 4 of this annex.

ROAD SECTOR PROJECT
Economic Analysis
l.        For the economic evaluation of the Road Maintenance Program, the
Bank's new Third Generation Highway Design and Maintenance Standards Model
(HDM III) was used. This model predicts the life-cycle costs of different
road design and maintenance options, including different time staging
strategies, either for a given road project on a specific alignment, or for
grotups or links of an entire highway network. It estimates the total costs
for large numbers of alternative maintenance policies on a year-by-year
basis, and can thus be used to search for the alternative with the highest
net present value (NPV) at given discount rates, or the highest internal rate
of return (IRR). The objective is, thus, to search out that combination of
standards and policies which results in the minimum total life-cycle costs to
society, including the costs to road users, as well as the costs borne by the
highway authority. Vehicle speeds and operating costs, and road deteriora-
tion and maintenance costs, are internally estimated by the model as a
function of the road design and maintenance standards, traffic volume and
axle loads, and environmental conditions. Maintenance and vehicle operating
costs are first estimated in physical quantities; then prices and unit costs,
as specified by the user, are applied to determine the total financial,
economic and foreign exchange cost.
2.        For the present program, the model was used with respect to
(a) asphalt concrete and (b) surface treated paved roads, and (c) gravel and
(d) earth surface roads. The road sections wit}: Portland cement concrete
were analyzed separately since the HDM-III model does not cover the
deterioration of such roads. The kilometrage of the road network, in total
and by zone (a distinction made essentially to capture climatic and soil
effects), is given in Table 1 of this annex, where each cell is identified as
a  group.
3.        For each of the groups so identified (i.e., for each of the three
zones and the four surface types covered in the HDM-IIl model), a further
classification was established according to matrices between road condition
and traffic, as illustrated in Table 2 of this annex. The cells in these
matrices, expressed in kilometers, are identified as -links.- Thus, for each
of the groups, a set of links was established (for paved roads ranging from
10 to 16 in each region, depending upon how many cells in the matrix were
filled by a significant kilometrage, and for gravel and earth roads, com-
prising three links each in each region).
4.         For the paved roads, the classification of each link was based
partly upon a general road inventory. This inventory identified, inter alia,
surface type and the overall condition of the road pavement. For the purpose
of the model use, this information was supplemented by further data and then
translated into assessments of pavement composition and strength; pavement
cracking, rutting, raveling and other blemishes; and surface roughness. For
the unpaved roads, surface condition is not quantified since it is forever
changing, as a function of traffic and blading policy, and is predicted by



- 57 -
ANNEX 2
Page 2 of 4
the model given the material (gravel and earth) characteristics, which were
assessed based upon available data.
5.        Traffic volumes were obtained from routine observation data,
covering the full classification matrix. The annual traffic growth rate was
5% for unpaved roads and ranged from 2.5% to 6.5% for paved roads, depending
upon vehicle type.
6.        Five vehicle categories, namely car, pickup, bus, light-truck and
heavy-truck, were used to represent the traffic composition in the analysis.
Detailed information for each category was also provided, including fuel
type, gross vehicle mass, pay load, equivalent number of axles per vehicle,
normal vehicle service life, hoturs and kilometers driven per year, and
average number of passengers per vehicle.
7.        Also, basic cost inputs were provided.  For paved roads, this
included unit costs for routine maintenance, pothole patching, surface dress-
ings, overlays and typical rehabilitation. Similarly, for unpaved roads,
unit costs for routine maintenance, blading with a motorgrader, spot
regraveling and full regraveling were provided (Table 3 of this annex).
Finally, unit costs of the different components of vehicle ownership, mainte-
nance and operation were provided (Table 4 of this annex). Tables 3 and 4
show cost data in terms of financial, economic and foreign exchange costs.
8.        The policy optimization was carried out first at the link level,
seeing that the optimum policy would vary from link to link, depending upon
their respective characteristics. In formulating the set of maintenance
policy alternatives for final evaluation, it was necessary, therefore, first
to test a wide range of maintenance options before discarding some in favor
of others. For the sake of computational efficiency, it was convenient to
use the same set of policy options for all the paved roads, and similarly for
unpaved roads.
9.        Table 5 of this annex gives a set of 27 alternatives that were
evaluated for each link of paved roads. As can be seen, maintenance opera-
tions on paved roads, in addition to basic routine maintenance, may consist
of any combination of patching, resealing, overlay and pavement reconstruc-
tion, and they can all be triggered at various levels of distress.
Alternative 01 is the baseline case (or null alternative) where, besides
basic routine maintenance which is performed under all alternatives, only a
nominal amount of patching is done. (The purpose of defining this alterna-
tive is to evaluate the additional benefits of increments in maintenance.)
The table includes three sets of policy combinations:
(a)  Nos. 1-10:   Different combinations between patching potholes (none
or all) and applying surface treatments at various extents of
surface cracking (5, 25, 50 or 75% of the surface cracked).
(b) Nos. 11-19: Different combinations between not using surface
dressings or applying them at 25% or 50% cracking, and putting on a
5 cm asphalt concrete overlay at roughness 65, 55 or 45 QI; and



- 58 -
ANNEX 2
Page 3 of 4
(c) Nos. 20-27: As (b) preceding, but, instead of overlay,
rehabilitating with new granular base and asphalt concrete (Nos.
20-25) or surface treatment (Nos. 26-27) upon reaching roughness 70
or 90 QI.
10.       Tables 6 and 7 of this annex give a set of 31 alternatives
evaluated for gravel and earth roads respectively. The maintenance opera-
tions to be considered, in addition to routine maintenance, are blading, spot
regraveling and full regraveling. The baseline case here is nominal
regraveling, plus grading once, twice or four times per year, for low, medium
and high traffic volumes, respectively. There are, essentially, two sets of
policy combinations:
(a) Nos. 41-47: Spot regraveling and blading at various frequencies as
a runction of vehicle passes; and
(b) Nos. 48-68: As (a) preceding, but also regraveling with 15, 20 or
25 cm of new gravel when the gravel thickness has worn down to a
nominal 5 cm.
-1.       The maintenance alternatives were evaluated for each link on the
basis (0) of net present value (NPV) of each alternative when compared with
the baseline case at a discount rate of 12%  and (l1) of the internal rate of
return CERR). The analyses were carried out over a 20-year period. Under no
buidgetary constraint, the optimum policy on each link would be the one that
maximizes the NPV. (The discount rate of 12% represents the opportuaity cost
of capital in Chile - a higher discount rate would change the optimum
policies toward those less capital-intensive.) Tables 5 to 7 of this annex
give, for illustrative purposes, the arrays of NPV and IRR for some typical
links; the optimum policies are underlined with single and double lines in
the case of the NPV and the IRR criteria, respectively.
12.       Pursuing the maximum NPV criterion without constraint would lead to
a program costing more than the budget available. To prune it down to an
acceptable level, the Bank's model for Expenditure Programing under Budget
Constraint was used in conjunction with the HDM-III model. The Budget
Constraint model uses mathematical programing to evaluate the tradeoffs
between competing alternatives, in order to maximize the objective function,
NPV, against the resource constraint, budgetary provision, for distinct
periods of time.
13.       The following steps were taken in using the Budget Constraint
model:
(a) Three budget periods were considered, namely years 1-3, years 4-6,
and years 7-20, the budgetary amounts for the three periods being
US$365, 350 and 1,757 million respectively.
(b) The HDM analysis had shown that, for links of identical
characteristics, near-enough the same ranking between policy
alternatives was obtained in the three regions. Therefore, these
links of identical characteristics were lumped together.



- 59 -
ANNEX 2
Page 4 of 4
(c) In order not to bias the choice between capital or recurrent
expenditures, they were lumped together into one expenditure
designation.
(d) For each link to be analyzed, four policies (in addition to the
*-null- alternative) were selected for analysis, representing the
options that would be the most likely competitors toward arriving
at the overall optimum.
14.       The results of the analysis are given in Table 8 of this annex for
paved roads and in Table 9 for unpaved gravel and earth roads, in terms of
the kilometrage of roads to be given various types of maintenance and
rehabilitation, and the corresponding costs, for the three time periods. The
IRRs for these programs are 49% and over 100% for paved and unpaved roads
respectively.

ROAD SECTOR PROJECT
Organization and Execution of the Road Maintenance Program
A. Background
1.        The planning and control of road maintenance has traditionally been
the responsibility of the Road Maintenance Department of MOP's Roads
Directorate (Vialidad), Chart I of the report. Actual execution of road
maintenance has always been carried out by Vialidad's local offices, formerly
25 provincial offices, since 1978, 13 regional offices, comprising two or
three provinces each. HOP's traditional responsibility for the maintenance
of the total road network (at present about 79,000 km) was reduced in the
early 1980s to the Basic Network (about 22,500 km). As a result of a move
toward decentralization of administrative services, the Government decided,
at that time, to turn over responsibility for the Local Road Network (about
56,500 km) to the municipalities. However, this measure was never
implemented, Vialidad never completely relinquished responsibility for the
local network, and it has maintained its local organizational structure and
personnel in place.
B. MiOP's Road Maintenance Organization
2.        Under the proposed project, Vialidad would resume responsibility
for the maintenance of the Primary Local Network (about 24,000 km) and would
undertake spot interventions on the remaining, much less trafficked 32,500 km
of the Secondary Local Network whenever traffic flows were seriously
impeded. Vialidad is capable of absorbing this expanded responsibility
because: (a) maintenance expenditures have been rising rapidly since 1984 and
will be further increased under the proposed 1986-1988 expenditures program
until reaching an adequate level in 1988 (paras 2.21 and 3.07 of the report);
Cb) Vialidad has already been strengthening its maintenance organization and
will continue this effort under the proposed project (paras 3 through 6
following); (c) a high percentage of the expanded works program will be
uadertaken by contract (para 7 following); (d) Vialidad's present physical
infrastructure, throughout the country, is adequate for the requirements of
the expanded maintenance program (para 8 following); and (e) Vialidad's staff
and equipment fleet, although presently not sufficient for the full
requirements of the expanded program, will be strengthened under the proposed
project (paras 9 and 10 following).
3.        The effectiveness of the Road Maintenance Department, which had
been strengthened under Credit 4-CH and Loans 287-CH and 558-CH in the
1960s, was diminished during the 1970s because of insufficient funding for
maintenance and the political turmoil that affected all activities in the
country. This issue was addressed during preparation and appraisal of the
First Highway Reconstruction Project (Loan 1927-CH) and further pursued
during appraisal and implementation of the ongoing Second Highway
Reconstruction Project (Loan 2297-CH). Complying with covenants under
Sections 3.06(a) and (b) of Loan 1927-CH, MOP created, on May 25, 1982, a
Road Maintenance Council and a Maintenance Planning Subdepartment and
submitted to the Bank, in September 1982, a satisfactory 1983-1985 program



- 74 -
ANNEX 3
Page 2 of 4
for routine and perindic maintenance of the Basic Network, which has been
carried out satisfactorily. Complying with Covenant 4.03(a) of Loan 2297-CH,
MOP submitted, in June 1984, a satisfactory program far the maintenance of
the Local Network which served as a first step for the preparation of the
proposed project.
4.        Under both loans, MOP has also carried out an exemplary effort to
upgrade the technical capacity of its maintenance administration staff by:
(a) initiation of action that led to the organization, in Santiago, of the
First Latin American Highway Maintenance Seminar, sponsored jointly by the
United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America (ECLA) and the Bank
(August 1983); (b) participation of about 70 road maintenance engineers at
that seminar; (c) participation of MOP's top management and maintenance
planning staff at several international conferences on maintenance and
pavement management and visits to the road maintenance organization of the
host countries; (d) organization of bi-annual meetings of all regional road
maintenance engineers to share the International experiences and findings and
to discuss the requirements for carrying out a national effort to strengthen
road maintenance; (e) application of the Bank's Highway Design and
Maintenance Standards Model (1DM) in the planning of road maintenance;
(f) sending of Vialidad's HDM expert to Bank headquarters for three months to
familiarize himself with the use of the third generation of the HDM model and
to prepare the maintenance program used in the evaluation of the proposed
project; and (g) initiation of the strengthening of Vialidad's Maintenance
Department, as discussed in the next paragraph.
5.        Since 1982, Vialidad has been progressively strengthening its
Maintenance Department in preparation for its increased obligations for
planning, managing and monitoring the proposed expanded road maintenance
program. These tasks will be accomplished through its four Subdepartments:
(a) Maintenance Planning, staffed by four professionals and supporting
personnel, has carried out the preparation of the proposed project and is in
charge of: (i) the road maintenance inventory; (ii) medium- and long-term
planning; (iii) estimates of work quantities, of frequencies of operations,
and of uni costs; (iv) assignment of priorities; (v) estimates of needed
revenues; and (vi) programing of works. Most of the planning tasks will be
carried oat using HDM-III.
(b) Standards and Specifications, staffed by an engineer and supporting
staff, is in charge of: (i) study and determination of maintenance
techniques; (1i) technical specifications for maintenance operations; and
(iii) contracting procedures for maintenance works.
(c) Execution, staffed by five professionals and supporting personnel,
is in charge of: (i) implementation of the works program; (ii) allocation of
funds and resources; (iii) monitoring of the program and of actual
operational costs; (iv) management of financing of the maintenance program;
(v) preparation of disbursement applications; and (vi) coordination of
training.
(d) Services, staffed by four mechanical engineers and supporting
personnel, is in charge of: (i) equipment administration; (if) planning of



- 75 -
ANNEX 3
Page 3 of 4
equipment and spare parts procurement; and (iii) workshops and equipment
repair.
6.        Actual execution of the maintenance works is carried out by
Vialidad's 13 regional offices. The typical organizational chart of a
regional office is shown on Chart II of the report. It comprises (a) an
administration department; (b) a maintenance department in charge of force
account works, including a subdepartment for equipment and workshop
management; and (c) a civil works contracts department, which handles
contracting of construction and of maintenance works. The line of
responsibilities reaches through these departments further down to the
Provincial Delegates (two or three for each region), where it is divided
again into force account and contracted operations. The force account
operations are divided into routine maintenance of the Basic Network within
each province and routine maintenance of the provincial Local Network, each
one of which is carried out by an adequate number of maintenance crews. Each
maintenance crew is responsible for about 200 km of roads and comprises one
foreman, one driver, and four to six laborers, supported permanently by an
eight-ton truck and auxiliary equipment, and by additional major equipment,
according to needs. The contracts for routine and periodic maintenance, as
well as for new construction and rehabilitation of roads and bridges, are
supervised by staff of the contracts office in each provincial delegation
under the technical control of the regional civil works contracts department.
7.        The increase of road maintenance operations under the project would
be absorbed mainly through contracting. At present, all periodic and
deferred maintenance and about 30% of routine maintenance is carried out by
contract. The percentage of routine maintenance executed by contract would
increase under the project and is expected to reach an average of 36% during
the three years (about US$33 million). Execution of routine maintenance by
force account would average 64% (about US$59 million) over the three years
and would, therefore, not demand a substantial increase of MOP's personnel
and equipment fleet. The substantially increased demand in supervisory
capacity would be met by reassignment of MOP supervisors from construction
supervision, which would diminish, and mostly by hiring consultants.
C. Infrastructure, Personnel and Equipment Requirements
8.        As discut'ed in paragraph I preceding, Vialidad's infrastructure in
office buildings, war 'houses and workshops in the regional capitals and in
the provinces is suff'cient to cope with the demands of the expanded mainte-
nance program under ;he proposed policies.
9.        Table I of this annex sbows the relationship between the number of
Vialidad staff that were engaged in maintenance operations in November 1984,
the expansion of the number of staff already authorized before appraisal of
the project, and the staff needed for the execution of the maintenance
program, considering present productivity. Vialidad is selectively carrying
out the authorized expansion and is seeking a restructuring of the
authorization to make it consistent with real needs. It follows that, even
assuming that the productivity would not be increased under the project, the
need for additional staff would stay within boundaries easily manageable
through reassigning and training of present staff and minimal hiring of new
personnel. The only serious gap is that of the number of professionals



- 76 -
ANNEX 3
Page 4 of 4
available for management and supervision. Vialidad, however, is taking
measures to upgrade existing maintenance personnel or to transfer staff from
the construction department. Additional employment of about 600 unskilled
laborers is no problem and is consistent with the Government's policy to
reduce unemployment.
10.       Table 3.2 of the report shows the equipment required to carry out
the programed force account maintenance, the present equipment in good-to-
regular and in less-than-regular condition, and the equipment to be procured
under the project to complete the required fleet. Equipment administration
is carried out in an efficient and cost-effective manner, relying
substantially upon contracted maintenance of equipment. Preventive
maintenance of about 80% of the equipment units is carried out in MOP's
regional and provincial workshops and 20Z in private workshops. More
detailed information provided by MOP on curative maintenance carried out in
1984 (Table 2 of this annex) shows that 80% of the repair operations were
carried out in MOP's workshops (88% for light vehicles and 52% for heavy
equipment) and 20% by equipment dealers and specialized workshops. Most of
the operations carried out in MOP's workshops corresponded to minor repairs,
whereas heavy repair operations were mostly contracted out, representing 77%
of the total cost of curative maintenance of the equipment fleet. The
upgrading of equipment management, and the increased reliance upon
contracting of equipment maintenance that Vialidad has been carrying out
during these last three years, will be strengthened under the project through
the training component, which includes employment of an expatriate equipment
maintenance expert.

Information Necessary for Project Monitoring
1.        To facilitate adequate monitoring of the project, quarterly
Progress Reports (due March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31 of
every year) would be prepared by the Ministry of Public Works (MOP). They
would contain the information outlined below:
(a) Road expenditures and their financing for the previous two years
and for the current year, and budgetary projections for the period
until 1991; to be updated every year in the June 30 report; details
as modified by supervision missions from time to time; and
(b)  Breakdown of maintenance expenditures during the last two years
between works executed by contract and by force account, the latter
with separate indication of expenditures for labor, equipment,
fuel, materials and administration.
2.        MOP's expenditures for the maintenance of the secondary local net-
work (spot interventions) during the two previous years, contributions
supplied by the municipalities or other public and private entities and data
on works performed in each region and in total. To be updated in the
September 30 report.
3.        Unit costs and productivity of the different force account
maintenance operations for each region, or for characteristic zones of the
country, and comparison of the unit costs with the unit costs for similar
operations executed by contract. To be updated in the March 31 and
September 30 reports.
4.        Length of the Basic Network and or the Primary Local Network under
maintenance during the two previous years with separate data for each type of
surface in each region and in total. To be updated in the March 31 report.
5.        Compliance during the previous two years, and projected compliance
