Borrower:              India, acting by its President-
Beneficiary:           Coal India Ltd. (CIL)
Amount:                US$248 million equivalent.
Terms:                 Payable in 20 years, including five years of grace at
the Bank standard variable interest rate.
On-lending Terms:      GOI to CIL for a period of 15 years, including five
years' grace, at an effective interest rate of not
less than 13.25% per annum.  CIL to Bharat Coking
Coal Ltd. (BCCL) for a period of 15 years, including
five years of grace, at an effective interest rate of
not less than 13.25% per annum.
Project Description:  The objective of the project is to increase the
supply of coking coal to the steel sector through the
development of the Jharia Open Cast Block II and
Pootkee-Bulliary mines. It will also improve the
average quality of coking coal supplies contributing
to a better efficiency in the use of indigenous
resources. The project consists of the development
of one open-pit mine and one underground mine (with
design capacities of 2.5 and 3.0 million tons per
annum raw coal respectively), two coal washeries and
other associated facilities in the Jharia coalfield
in the State of Bibar. The project will support
institutional development in the areas of underground
mine design and operating practices as well as
project management, sand transportation and shaft
sinking. It will ^lso address the sectoral issue of
coal quality and fac4litate the continuation of the
dialogue on coal transportation and distribution,
producer-consumer linkages, and investment planning.
The project faces minimal technical risks and a
possible financial risk is mitigated by GOI's
commitment to a pricing policy which ensures the
continued viability of CIL.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of India (GOI) has requested a Bank loan of
US$248 million to assist in the financing of the Jharia Coking Coal
Project. The Project, which is located in the state of Bihar, has two main
components: (i) the Open Cast Block II min:ng complex which comprises the
development of a 2.5 million ton per year (tpy) open-pit mine and
associated washery to produce 1.1 million tpy of washed prime coking coal;
and (ii) the Pootkee-Bulliary mining complex which entails the development
of a 3.0 million tpy underground mine and washery facilities with a
capacity to produce 1.5 million tpy of washed prime coking coal. Both
mining complexes will be constructed and operated by Bharat Coking Coal
Ltd. (BCCL), a wholly-owned subsidiary cf Coal India Ltd. (CIL), a GOI
undertaking. The Jharia Coking Coal Project forms part of the Government
strategy to develop indigenous resources to meet the growing demand for
coking coal and to improve the overall operating efficiency of the sector
by introducing additional low cost open-pit and mechanized underground
mining operations.
1.02      The financing requirements of the Project, including
contingencies and escalation are estimated at US$696 million, of which
about US$245 million (35%) will be in foreign exchange. The proposed Bank
loan of US$248 million would cover about 94% of the foreign exchange
required. The balance will be provided by Overseas Development
Administration (ODA) of the United Kingdom through its bilateral program
for assisting the Indian coal industry. The local component would be
provided from internally generated funds of CIL, Government resources and
Bank funds.
1.03      The proposed project was submitted by GOI to the Bank irn July
*-2, and a pre-appraisal mission visited India in October 1982.  It was
a  raised in March 1983 and post-appraised in May 1984.
II. THE COAL SECTOR 1/
A.   Reserves and Production
2.01      Coal production in India is largely in the hands of the wholly
government-owned CIL which accounts for about 90% of coal production.
Other coal producers are Singareni Collieries Ltd. (SCL) with about 8% of
total coal production, which is owned by GOI and the State Government of
Andhra Pradesh, and two captive cokirn, coal mines of the Tata Iron and
Steel Company (TISCO) and the Indian Iron and Steel Company (IISCO) - about
1% each of total coal production.2/ The Department of Coal (DOC) is in
charge of policymaking and it monitors and coordinates activities in the
sector including approving CIL's production targets and annual investment
and operating budgets.  Linkages between new mines and major consumers are
1/  Fuller background details of the coal sector are provided in India Coal
Sector Report, Report 3601-IN, September 1982, and Dudhichua Coal Project SAR,
Report 4714-IN, February 1984.

established by an interministerial committee and sanctioned by the Planning
Commission. CIL's production and investment program are also scrutinized
and reviewed by the Planning Commission.
2.02      Coal is India's most abundant indigenous energy source.  Total
coal resources (in seams greater than 0.5 meters and at depths of up to
1,200 meters) are estimated at 112 billion tons.3/ India's coal resources
are over eight times as large, in terms of calorific value, as India's
hydrocarbon resources which were recently estimated at 6.5 billion tons of
oil equivalent.4/ The coal resources consist of about 78% thermal coal
used primarily for heat and steam generation and 22% coking (i.e.,
metallurgical) coal used in steel making. There is a wide variation in the
quality of thermal coal reserves (with useful calorific value ranging from
1,300 kcal/kg to over 6,200 kcal/kg) and in coking coal reserves (varying
in ash content from about 15% to over 35%). Reserves of high quality
thermal and coking coals are limited and both are in short supply.
2.03      To date, the coking coal reserves have been relatively more
extensively explored and developed than the thermal reserves. As a result,
coking coal reserves account for about 47% of proven coal reserves. The
coking coal reserves are specified as prime coking coal (PCC), medium
coking coal (MCC) and semi coking coal (SCC) according to caking and
swelling characteristics.5/ The bulk of the reserves (71%) are medium
coking coal.  The ash content for both PCC and MCC ranges from about 15% to
35% and for SCC from about 15% to 18%.

on the results of geological work undertaken in the past several
years. The additional reserves are almost entirely thermal.

one ton of oil.

-3-
2.04      During the mid to late 19709 coal production in India was
constrained and new projects delayed by a variety of difficulties including
power interruptions, mine floodings, labor unrest and input shortages.
These production difficulties, combined with transportation problems
resulted in coal supply disruptions to thermal power plants and major
shortages of both thermal and coking coal for industrial consumers. Since
1980, however, the production situation has been largely turned around due
in part to improvement in external factors such as power supplies and in
part to improvement in management effectiveness especially regarding new
project implementation. This has led to a significant expansion of
production during the last five years and preliminary figures for 1984/85
Indicate a production of 149 million tons (incltding 131 million tons from
CIL) compared with 104 million tons in 1979/80 (of which 91 million tons
were from CIL).
B.        Government Development Strategy
1. Objectives
2.05      Coal is India's most abundant indigenous energy source and
presently provides over 50X of India's commercial energy consumption.
GOI's energy plans emphasize the development of coal both as a fuel for
thermal power generation and for direct use by industrial and commercial
consumers. In the 1970s, when coal shortages were prevalent, GOI's main
priorities were to increase production as quickly as possible with llttle
regard for efficiency, cost-effectiveness, coal quality or distributional
factors.  Today, GOI's strategy has evolved to emphasize an adequate supply
of satisfactory quality coal with economically efficient mining and
transportation systems. Specifically, GOt's coal development strategy had
the following major emphases:
(a) development of new large-scale highly mechanized coal mines
which will permit the rapid expansion of coal production
with due regard to safety and environmental protection using
increasingly efficient mining teclnologies and equipment;
(b) rehabilitation and mechanization of certain deep underground
prime coking coal operations in the Jharia Coalfield In
order to increase the supply of prime coking coal as rapidly
as possible and reduce the need for imports;
(c) improvement in the availability and cost of coal to
consumers in distant locations from existing coalfields by
optimizing mineconsumer linkages, improving coal
transportation systems and giving priority to exploring for
and developing mines in western and southern India; and
(d) introduction of measures to improve the quality of coal
delivered to consumers (in terms of both absolute quality
and consistency of quality) to reduce transportation
requirements and improve the efficiency of thermal power
units, steel plants, industrial boilers, etc.

2.   Investment Program
2.06      During the five years from 1980/81 to 1984/85 incluslve, CIL has
implemented an investment program of Rs 34 billion (equivalent to US$3.5
billion). For the next five years, an investment of Rs 60 billion
(US$5 billion)6/ in mid 1984  . terms of which about 20% would be foreign
exchange requirements, is anticipated as shown below:
CIL - Investment Program
(mid 1984/85 terms)
1984/85    1985/86    1986/87   1987/88   1988/89   1989/90
Rs million        8,800      10,000      11,C00     12,000    13,000    14,000
USS million         730         830         920      1,000     1,080      1,170
2.07      The above program represents an increase of about 402 in real
terms compared with the previous five years. The increase represents a
combination of an increase in both the number and average slze of projects
in the investment program as well as an increase in the amount of
development work required for each new large scale project. The sector 1i
considered to be making good progress towards establishlng the necessary
organizational resources and capabilities to implement the above program
although continued progress is essential if the program is to be realized.
In particular, CIL must make continued progress in improving its
implementation capabilities (para 4.08) and, once Improvements are
demonstrated, in disseminating them to other projects throughout the CIL
Group. The program is also viewed as consistent with the budgetary
allocation priority given by GOt to coal sector development. The program
consists of approximately 23% for expenditures co reconstruct and improve
operation at existing mines, 39Z for new projects presently being
implemented, 21% for projects prepared and awaiting final sanction before
initiating construction and 17% for non-mine projects including washeries,
sand transportation and project feasibility work. Approximately 60-65X of
the expenditures are for open-pit mining projects and 20-25% for
underground projects - the balance being non-mine projects.  A review of
CIL's overall investment program indicates that with a few exceptions the
investment program is basically following a least cost development path.
Examples are given in para 8.10 for the expansion of cokirg coal
production.
2.08      The investment program places a strong emphasis on the
identification and development of new coalfields which are nearer to
consumers who are in distant locations from the major coalfields in eastern
India. In particular, priority is being given to meet the needs of
consumers in western and southern India through exploratior. and development
6/ Preliminary figures for the Seventh Plan prepared by a GOI working
group for the coal/lignite sector target an investment program of
Rs 85,000 million from 1985/86 to 1989/90. This is not considered
achievable. The investment estimate given in the text was prepared by
Bank staff and is considered feasible if CIL continues to improve its
implementation capabilities.

of new coalfields in the region of Nagpur, Maharastra and in the region of
Bilaspur, Madhya Pradesh (by Western Coalfields Ltd.) and in Andhra Pradesh
(by Singareni Coalfields Ltd). The efforts have resulted in promising
discoveries and developments in the Kusmunda and Korba coalfields in Madhya
Pradesh (the Gevra deposit is located in the latter), the Wardha Valley
(Maharastra) and the Godvari Valley (Andhra Pradesh). In order to improve
coal transportation to consumers in remote locations, GOI is presently
undertaking studies of possible improvements in coal transportation and
producer/consumer linkages. Improvements in coal transportation will be
aided by measures to improve coal quality (which will increase the
calorific value of a given quantity of coal thus reducing amounts to be
transported) as discussed in para 2.10.
2.09      While the larger part of the program is for thermal coal
projects, coking coal projects are importantly emphasized in the program.
Although total coking coal production Is in line with steel industry
demand, PCC has been in short supply for several years while the other
grades have been adequately available. During the past five years an
average 0.4 million tons per year (tpy) PCC imports was required costing
about US$30 million yearly and a similar level of imports is expected to be
needed in 1984/85. PCC production is much more difficult to increase than
production of lower grades of coking coal (MCC and SCC) or thermal coal
because mining conditions in Jharia coal field are much more difficult than
for coal fields in most other parts of India. Most underground mines have
been in the range of 0.1-0.5 million tpy and the recovery of coal in Jharia
has generally been in the order of 25-40%,7/ with an output per manshift
KOMS) of about 0.5-0.6 tons. These low recovery and productivity factors
considerably constrain PCC production in India. CIL has drawn up and is
implementing the Jharia Reconstruction Program to improve the recovery and
production of PCC. One of the most promising measures is to mine the
shallower areas by open-pit mining methods; this should provide for 90% or
more recovery of previously unmined areas together with recovery of coal
from old workings. Another is to combine groups of small, unmechanized
mines (generally 0.1-0.3 million tpy production) into larger single units
(up to 3.0 million tpy each) using more efficient, mechanized production
and haulage systems where geological conditions permit. Such
rehabilitation projects provide for increased productivity (with an OMS of
up to 2.0 for underground mines and 4.0 or higher for open-pit mines),
higher output (mines of 1-5 million tpy) and higher recoveries (from 60 to
80%). The Jharia Coking Coal project encompasses both approaches: the
Block II complex uses open-pit mining technology and the Pootkee-Bulliary
complex is a rehabilitation undertaking which utilizes longwall mechanized
mining approach.
7/  Most underground mining methods can only recover a certain portion of
the coal reserves in any particular deposit - generally about 45-55%.
In the case of Jharia, prevailing geological conditions of thick coal
seams in sands;one strata result in much lower recovery factors. The
coal that is left in the ground is, so far, effectively lost from the
reserve base suitable for productior..

3.   Coal Quality Improvements
2.10      GOI is rightly placing a high priority on improving the quality
(in terms of consistency of coal quality as well as absolute coal quality)
of both thermal and coking coals to consumers. GOI has appointed high
level government commissions to study the problem of both thermal coal
supplies (Report of the Committee on the Problem of Coal Supply to Thermal
Power Stations, a.k.a. the Fazal Committee Report, October 1983) and coking
coal supplies (Report of the Working Group on New Sources of Coking Coals,
Hot Metal Production, and Coal Availability/Linkage to Washeries During the
Seventh Plan, a.k.a. the C. S. Jha Committee Report, September 1984). For
thermal coal, the Fazal Committee sade a broad range of recommendations
covering various topics such as specific mine/power plant linkages, railway
loading and dispatch procedures, coal preparation and deshaling, coal
sampling and testing, coal stockpiling and coal quality bonus/penalty
contractual arrangements. A number of measures are already being
implemented. These include, 'sportantly, the introduction of contracts
between the coal companies and major power utilities with joint sampling
for coal quality and bonus/penalty clauses for quality differences versus
agreed specifications. Another important measure which has been introduced
by CIL is that satisfactory coal quality is now a criteria of mine
managers' operating performance. CIL has started measurement and record
keeping of the removal of rock and waste material from coal supplies,
together with procedures to monitor the accuracy of the record keeping.
Other useful measures are presently being considered for implementation by
the Department of Coal.
2.11      The steel plants are concerned regarding (i) a steady
deterioration in PCC quallty over the past several years and (ii) daily
fluctuation in the quality of PCC received. The problem has been most
severe and is mainly reflected in the increase of ash content in the coal.
The CIL PCC washeries were designed to receive raw coal with 25% average
ash content and produce washed coal with 17% average ash content. However
the quality of both raw coal and washed coal has deteriorated in recent
years and in 1983/84 the raw coal had 312 average ash content and the
washed coal 22.5% average ash content8/ with daily fluctuation of as much
as 1-2%. The decline in raw coal quality is largely due to gradual
deterioration in the resource base combined with dilution due to increased
use of blasting and mechanical coal cutting and inadequate supervision.
Such high ash content means, on the one hand, a much higher coking coal
production is required to meet a given level of hot metal production and,
on the other hand, the productivity of the blast furnace is adversely
affected. Improvement in the ash content of washed coking coal would
therefore provide important savings in coking coal and steel imports as
well as reducing steel production costs and lowering future investment
needed to expand the capacity of coking coal mines and steel production
facilities.
8/ By comparison most modern steel plants in other countries use washed
coking coal with ash in the range of 6-10%.



-7-
2.12      During the past year the GOI and CIL have given a high priority
to improving PCC quality. Specifically, CIL has (a) eliminated a number of
substandard coals from the feed to the washeries and (b) initiated various
repairs and improvements at some of the older washeries which were
transferred from ownership of SAIL to CIL in October 1983. Largely as a
result of these two measures the average ash percentage in prime coking
coal was reduced to 20.6% in first quarter 1984/85. Further improvements
in PCC quality are expected over the next several years when (a) supplies
of washed coal with 17% ash content become available from new mine/washery
complexes such as Block II and Pootkee-Bulliary, and (b) as CIL implements
a program of measures to improve raw coal supplies and washery operations.
Measures to improve raw coal supplies include installation of new coal
handling plants at some coking coal mines, development of new mining areas
with superior quality prime coking coal, testing by Central Fuel Research
Institute of certain coals with disputed coking qualities and use of
premium quality Assam coal for blending purposes. Measures to improve
washery operations include increased capital expenditures for washery
improvements, installation of rotary breakers at certain washeries,
upgrading of slurry by froth flotation at Dugda I and II washeries,
umdifications to Patherdih washery, trials with pre-screening jigs at
Barora washery and possible establishment of a washery institute.
C.   Role of the Bank
2.13      The rationale for the Bank's involvement in the coal sector is to
support its development so that it takes places in an efficient manner from
technical and economic standpoints, including efficient resource
allocation, and so that consumers are able to obtain sufficient quantities
of adequate quality coal in a timely manner. The approach so far has been
to (a) establish a policy dialogue to identify and address critical
economic, sectoral and institutional issues that may impede the
satisfactory achievement of GOI's objectives as outlined in para 2.05, and
Cb) initiate a lending program focused on large scale projects aimed at
assisting GO to improve its implementation and operational capabilities
for highly mechanized, capital intensive mining projects.
2.14      The policy dialogue originated with a Coal Sector Survey (Report
3601-IN, September 1982) which addressed selected issues pertaining to coal
supply/demand prospects, pricing, investment and financing. Energy pricing
and resource mobilization were also addressed in Economic Situation of
India and Resource Mobilization Issues (Report 4375-IN), April 1983. The
policy dialogue, established during this sector work, was further developed
with specific measures regarding coal pricing and coal transportation in
the first lending operation for the Dudhichua Coal Project (Report 4714-IN,
February 28, 1984) to provide thermal coal for power generation. A pricing
agreement was reached with GOI in the Dudhichua project which should ensure
that the GOI's pricing approach will result in prices that provide the
correct signals to both consumers and producers regarding the economic
value of coal. Provided pricing increases are made in a timely manner, the



-8-
pricing approach should also progressively move the sector towards a sound
financing footing. Additionally, improvements in the coal transportation
and coal producer/consumer linkages are being studied which should lead to
economic coal distribution patterns and should assist GOI in improving coal
supplies to consumers in western and southern India. In the last lending
operation support was also provided to institutional developments in CIL in
operation of large-scale open-pit mines, project management, and budgeting
and cost control. Local and foreign consultants have been retained by GOI
and CIL to provide assistance on these institutional matters.
2.15      GOI has requested the Bank Group financing of projects to
increase production of both thermal and coking coals, proposing one coal
lending operation per year for the next several years. The Jharia Coking
Coal Project will be the second of these operations, and the Gevra Thermal
Coal Expansion Project is under preparation for FY1986. It is intended
that the lending strategy should lead to involvement with all of CIL
subsidiaries, while progressively addressing one or two important
sectoral/institutional issues. The next priorities are (i) to develop
improvements in coal sector manpower planning and training which are
considered essential if CIL's project implementation and operational
capabilities are to expand in line with the proposed investment program and
(ii) to ensure that the implementation of measures to improve thermal coal
quality takes place in a timely manner. Subsequently, it is intended to
broaden the scope of the Bank's involvement to unmechanized mining
operations including improvements in mine safety. Additionally, further
sector work is planned for FY1986 which would focus on a more detailed and
in-depth review of CIL's approach for identifying, selecting, preparing and
implementing its investment decisions, as well as a review of the
operational and economic efficiency of a large number of labor intensive
underground operations.

III. THE MARKET FOR COKING COAL
A.   Coking Coal Supply and Demand Prospects
1.   Overview of Indian Coal Market
3.01      Coal is essential for future industrial growth in India.  At
present, industrial and commercial consumption account for an estimated 48%
of coal consumption in India. The largest industrial consumers are the
steel sector primarily for coking coal (18%), tbe cement sector (6Z) and
the fertilizer sector (3X). The balance (21%) is used largely for heat and
steam generation by about 20,000 industrial units in a variety of different
industrial subsectors. Besides the industrial sector, power generation
accounts for 42% of coal consumption, railways (7%) and residential (3%).
Demand projections for the period up to 1989/90 indicate that coal demand
will be in the range of 200-240 million tons by 1989/90 (an average annual
growth of 6.6-9.9% per year) depending on underlying assumptions regarding
product growth and energy consumption trends in different coal consuming
sectors and inter-fuel market shares. Based on this range the most likely
estimate of future coal demand in 1989/90 is 220 million tons.  Power
sector demand for coal is expected to grow most rapidly and will account
for 50% of coal consumption by that year. The share of industry will
decline slightly (to about 44% in 1989/90) but steel industry consumption
of coking coal will increase slightly to 19% of total consumption. The
ratio of coking coal requirements to steel requirements will decline
slightly because of improved average blast furnace productivity due to the
expansions at Bhilai and Bokaro and the new plant at Vizag.

3.03      A review of the status of preparation and implementation of major
projects in CIL's investment program indicates that a production increase
of about 70 million tpy from 1983/84 to 1989/90 is feasible.  In
particular, CIL, has increased production by 30 million tpy in the past
four years (from 91 million tons in 1979/80 to 121 million tons in 1983/84)
and it is quite feasible that CIL's production could further increase by
another 70 million tpy by 1989/90 given that several large new open-pit
mines are being developed which would provide substantial production in the
late 1980s.
2.   Coking Coal Requirements and Supply Prospects
3.04      Coking coal is required primarily by the steel industry for
making coke, which is used in the blast furnace for steel making. In
addition, small quantities of coke (mostly produced from medium coking coal
which is presently in excess supply in India) are used by household and
industrial plants. In 1983/84, the integrated steel plants produced 9.1
million tons of hot metal. For the future, hot metal production is
projected to increase to 14.7 million tons in 1989/90-as described in
Annex 1 which provides a description of the steel industry and its
development prospects. The supply allocation and marketing of coking coal
in India takes place within a set of formalized procedures under the
auspices of GOI. A basic structure of linkages between washeries and steel
plants has been established and the coal controller who is appointed by GOI
and based in Calcutta makes monthly and quarterly supply allocations of
washed coking coal taking into account any production difficulties or
closures for maintenance and repair of either the washeries or the steel
plants.
9/ Coal production and demand have been targetted at 245 million tons
in 1989/90 by a GOI working group. These are not considered feasible.



-1 1.-
3.05      The basic product purchased by the steel mill is washed coking
coal. Washing reduces the ash content of the coal and provides for
consistent quality - both of which, improve blast furnace efficiency.
Coking coal requirements of each steel mill are based on a certain blend of
PCC, MCC and SCC. The blend ratio is fixed according to the technical
parameters of each plant to provide maximum efficiency in the blast
furnace. There is very little flexibility for adjusting the ratio if the
requirements and supplies of different coking coals are imbalanced. The
average blend for the Indian steel industry is in the order of 55/38/7 for
PCC/MCC/SCC. Washed coking coal supply and demand projections have been
prepared for the different types of coking coals as shown below.

million tpy in 1989/90 as discussed in Annex 1. The washed coking coal
supply projections have been prepared on the basis of projections of
washery capacity and mine production. There are presently twelve PCC
washeries plus three more planned and eight MCC washeries plus three more
planned or under construction (Annex 2). 10/ The SCC does not need washing
since its ash content (16-18X) is within acceptable limits for direct use

prepared based on a detailed review of CIL's coking coal mines together
with an assessment of future production trends at the TISCO and IISCO
mines. The projections include not only incremental production from new
projects but also declines in production at many existing operations due to
mine depletion. The projections have been prepared taking into account the
various grades of coking coal as follows:

3.07      The above projections indicate that while the coal companies
should be able to supply the steel sectors requirements for MCC, shortfalls
will occur for PCC and SCC. The shortfalls will be most severe for PCC.
As noted previously (para 2.09) PCC imports have been required for the past
several years and CIL has placed a high priority on increasing PCC
supplies. The above projections indicate that notwithstanding the efforts
to increase FCC production, it is to be expected that imports of PCC will
continue to be required and could increase to 1-1.5 million tors in the
mid-to-late 1980s. The Jharia coking coal project is an important part of
the increase in PCC expected in the late 1980s and without the project coal
import requirements would be much higher. SCC production takes place
largely in deep underground mines in Bihar/West Bengal where production can
only be expanded slowly due to difficult geological conditions. CIL is
examining ways of improving SCC supplies including shipments of suitable
quality coal from Assam. However, the shortages are less critical than for
PCC since they are much smaller and the steel industry can more readily
adjust its operations to counterbalance shortages of SCC than FCC.
3.08      The raw coal does not have uniform washing charactistics.  The
washing characteristics depend on which seam is being mined and which part
of the coalfield the seam is located in. Th.ts, the washeries are linked to
particular groups of mines based on the raw coal washing characteristics,
and the washeries have different design characteristics according to the
linkage specified. CIL is undertaking a construction program for new
washeries linked with incremental mine production. The washed coal supply
projections are based on adequate washing capacity being available to wash
all of the mine production. This is expected to be the case in all years
except 1987/88 when a temporary shortage of washing capacity may arise as
shown below:

3.09      Since it is very unlikely that any planned washeries can be
advanced to be available in 1987/88 CIL is presently considering
contingency plans to improve throughput at existing washeries such as
Bhojudih and Dugda I and II in the event chat coal supplies actually exceed
capacity 'La that year as projected. Also increased capacity may be
available at three other washeries owned by SAIL, IISCO and the Government
of West Bengal respectively.
B. Coking Coal Prices and Pricing Policy
3.10      Coal prices are set by GOI on an administered basis.  During the
1970s, prices were allowed to lag behind costs and the industry experienced
large losses. During the past five years, however, GOI has increased
prices on four separate occasions which has resulted in an overall price
increase of 88%. In 1982/83, GO! also authorized CIL to introduce an
internal retention price system whereby internal accounting prices were
established for each subsidiary which took due account of cost differences
between the subsidiaries due to geological conditions, locational factors
and other influences outside of the control of the subsidiary. This change
was in line with the recommendations in the India Coal Sector Report
(Report 3601-IN). The most recent coal price revision (January 1984),
resulted in prices basically in line with economically efficient levels.
Additionally, an important aspect of the 1984 price increase was that the
largest adjustments were provided for the higher grades of coal so that the
differentials between the different grades of coal would better reflect the
value to the users. The minehead price schedule is given in Annex 3. In
addition consumers pay certain taxes and levies which amount to
approximately 25% of thermal and coking coal minehead prices for Jharia
coals. The levies on coal in Bihar are given in Annex 4.
3.11      GOI's coal pricing approach is to set prices at the minehead with
a view to providing a satisfactory return on net worth under conditions of
efficient operation, and to ensuring the financial viability of Coal India
as well as progressively increasing the level of resource mobilization in
the sector in order to cover an increasing portion of coal sector capital
expenditures. GOI has agreed to review coal prices periodically in line
with the above pricing approach and with agreements made under the
Dudhichua Coal project. An inter-ministerial working group, headed by the
Chairman of the Bureau of Industrial Costs and Prices (BICP), was
established in early January 1985 to consider the need for a coal price
increase. The group is expected to complete its review by end February
1985, following which recommendations will be submitted to the Government.



-14-
3.12      Coking coal pricing, however, presents an addititional
complication because the basic product required by tite steel mills is
washed coking coal for feeding into coke ovents rather than the raw coal
produced by the mines. Additionally, in November 1983, the coking coal
washeries owned by SAIL were handed over to CIL. Prior to this date, SAIL
used to purchase raw coking coal from CIL paying a fee for washing.
Following the change in ownership, all coking coal is now sold on a washed
coal basis. Accordingly, CIL and SAIL introduced contracts for the sale of
washed coking coal which is in line with contractual arrangements in other
countries. In these contracts, the price of the washed coal is based on a
formula taking into account the administered price of the raw coking coal,
the operating cost of the washery, efficiency norms for the washery aud a
return on capital for the washery. Most importantly, the contracts include
bonus and penalty clauses relating to the quality (in particular, the ash
content) of the washed coking coal supplied to the steel plants. The
bonus/penalty system provides a direct incentive for CIL to improve both
its mining and washery operations to ensure the best possible feed to
SAIL. This pricing approach is considered satisfactory since it results in
prices very close to efficiency prices after due adjustment for quality
differentials. Ex-washery prices for coking coals with 20% ash content are
currently at Rs 560 per ton (US$46.7), including sales taxes and levies.
This is in line with the net-back parity price of imported Australian
coals"1/ which is estimated at US$50 per ton ex-washery after adjustments
for port handling, inland freight and quality differertials.
IV. THE BENEFICIARIES
A. Coal India Ltd. 121
L. Organization and Management
4.01      The CIL group of companies was organized by GOI in September
1975, following a restructuring of the coal companies which were
nationalized in the early 1970s. The group was established as a holding
company (CIL) and five 1 / wholly-owned subsidiaries, Bharat Coking Coal
Ltd. (BCCL), Central Coalfields Ltd. (CCL), Eastern Coalfields Ltd.
(ECL), Western Coalfields Ltd. (WCL), and the Central Mine Planning and
Design Institute (CMPDI). Its activities are regulated under the framework
of the Companies Act of 1956. CIL operates semi-autonomously under the
direction of an eleven-member Board of Directors, headed by its Chairmanr
appointed by the President of India. The Chairman also acts as Managing
Director, responsible for the day-to-day direction of the Group. The Board
of Directors also includes the chairmen of CIL's subsidiaries, and
11/ The CIF price of Australian coal is currently US$70 per ton for a
medium/high volatile, low sulphur, 10% ash coking coal.
12/ Further background details on Coal India Ltd. have been recently
discussed in the SAR for the Dudhichua Coal Project, Report 4714-IN,
February 1984.
13/ CIL also has one other small subsidiary, North-Eastern Coalfields
Ltd. (NEC), which is organized as an operating division directly under
CIL headquarters.



-15-
government representatives. The Board has also appointed a Technical
Committee, responsible for reviewing and recommending development projects
and bid awards for imported equipment.
4.02      According to its articles of incorporation, CIL is required to
seek GOI's approval, inter-alia, for specific investments of Rs 50 million
or more, five-year and annual plans of development and capital budget, and
its operating budget. Otherwise, CIL operates with autonomy for carrying
out its operations, including the implementation of new projects. CIL is
functionally organized with managers for production and safety, engineering
and supplies, corporate planning, project monitoring, coal marketing,
personnel and finance. The Technical D)irector and Finance Director are
also Board members. CIL organization chart is shown in Annex 5.
4.03      CIL's subsidiaries operate under the direction of a Board of
Directors, headed by a Chairman, who also acts as Managing Director,
appointed by the President of India. Four of the subsidiaries namely BCCL,
ECL, CCL and WCL are coal producing units organized functionally with
managers responsible for production, corporate planning and projects,
finance, marketing and personnel. For each company, mining activities are
organized into small regional areas, each under the supervision of an area
manager. Presently, these subsidiaries operate 384 mines, organized in 51
areas with an average production of about 2.5 million tpy per area. A more
detailed description of BCCL is provided below (paras 4.18 to 4.20).
4.04      In addition to setting general policies for its subsidiaries and
retaining authority regarding the typical managerial functions of a holding
company, CIL directly manages the financial resources of the group. CIL is
responsible for overseeing the group's investment program (para. 2.07).
All contributions from the GOI (about US$800 million in 1983/84) in the
form of new equity and long-term loans to fund the expansion programs are
channeled through CIL, who decides on the allocation to the subsidiary
companies depending on priorities and their cash position. Under this
scheme CIL is the borrower of all long-term loans, and as such it has
direct responsibility for servicing the long-term debt. Since CIL
is responsible for decision-making on financial and administrative matters,
and is the borrower of all long-term loans, it was considered as the
primary beneficiary of the Bank loan for Dudhichua and is accordingly
considered as the primary beneficiary of the proposed loan for Jharia.
4.05      The CIL group is a very large and complex organization.  Since
its inception in 1975, and particularly during the last six years, CIL has
made progress in terms of consolidating the organization, implementing
accounting and other operational control systems, expanding production,
improving the operational efficiency (particularly labor productivity), and
strengthening its capability for project preparation and implementation.
During this period, steps have been taken to decentralize the operations
giving more autonomy to subsidiaries and its operating arms, mainly
regarding operational, marketing and personnel matters. These efforts have
resulted in steady improvements in CIL's functio;'ng and CIL is now able to



-16-
play a major role in decentralizing from the Government the coordinating
function for the implementation of sectoral policies. The question has
been raised as to whether or not it would improve the efficiency of the
sector to decentralize the group and create several autonomous companies.
Such a move would not per se provide any substantial improvement in CIL's
operations at least at the present time and could retard the progress
already made. CIL has proved an effective agent in coordinating the
sector's development which would otherwise need to be undertaken by the
bureaucracy of the central government. There is, however, further room for
improvement in CIL's organization. A more effective approach adopted has
been to assist CIL in making further progress in strengthening its
operations under the present organizational structure. To this end, three
specific operational. and managerial issues were addressed under the
Dudhichua Coal Project. These relate to budgetary and cost control
systems, the operational efficiency in open-pit mines and project
management organization and practices.
4.06      The Indian Institute of Management (Ahmedabad) has been retained
by CIL to provide technical assistance for strengthening the operational
budgetary procedures of CIL and its subsidiaries. In particular, the
assistance, which will be channeled through CMPDI, will focus on definition
of cost and profit centers, basic procedures for budget formulation and
reporting, and definition of control mechanisms and corrective actions.
The design stage will be completed by mid-1985 and the Implementation will
follow thereafter.
4.07      CIL has also invited proposals (through CCL) to contract the
services of about 50 man-months of foreign consultants (financed under the
Dudhichua Loan, 2393-IN) for improving the efficiency of open-pit
operations. Six consulting firms specialtzed in operational aspects of
open cast mining have been invited to submit proposals under terms of
reference agreed with the Bank. Metchem, Canada, has been awarded the
contract and is expected to mobolize in February 1985. Additionally, CIL
has retained the Central Road Research Institute (New Delhi) to assist
CMPDI and CCL in the improvement of design, construction and maintenance of
haulroads in open-pit mines.
4.08      With regard to project management practices, various positive
steps have been taken following the dialogue initated with the Bank during
preparation, negotiations and early stages of implementation of the
Dudhichua Coal Project. Firstly, project managers were in the past
reporting to area general managers, who are mainly concerned with
production. Recently, this has been modified and the position of project
managers has been elevated so that they report to a position with
responsibility for project development rather than production. In BCCL for
example, a new position of Technical Director Projects has been created and
the hierarchical level of project managers has been upgraded to general
managers. Secondly, a project implementation manual has been prepared for
Dudhichua, following terms of reference agreed with the Bank. The Bank has
commented on a draft, and after some modifications the manual is expected
to be implemented in early 1985. Similar manuals have been requested for
both components of the Jharia Coking Coal Project (para. 5.32).

2.   Operations
4.09      During 1983/84 CIL produced 121 million tons of coal of which 95
million tons were thermal coal (79%), aP4 the balance 26 million tons
(21%), coking coals. The contribution of each subsidiary to CIL production
is shown below.

4.10      Underground mining accounted for 51% of CIL production in
1983/84. CIL is undertaking a program to rationalize its underground
production, basically aimed at reorganizing groups of small mines into
larger units and introducing mechanization both in coal extraction and
transnortation. This program is a sound strategy which is expected to
contribute to reducing unit production cost as well as providing increases
in production. At present 24 reorganization/mechanization projects are at
different stages of implementation throughout the CIL group, of which 9 are
for coking coal mines predominantly in BCCL. These schemes imply both the
mechanization of the room and pillar mining operations and the use of
mechanized longwall technology. At present only about 5% of CIL's
underground production is coming from mechanized mines but their proportion
will increase to about 35% in the early 1990s when these mechanization
projects are fully operational. Management of these mechanized mines,
particularly those using the fully mechanized longwall technology such as
Pootkee-Bulliary, needs strengthening. In order to improve the operation
of these mines, BCCL has agreed to retain technical assistance to improve
the design, management and operating procedures for highly mechanized
underground mines, and an outline for the scope of work is presented in
Annex 6. It has been agreed with BCCL that this technical assistance will
be financed with the proposed loan and that it will be initiated before
December 31, 1985 under terms of reference acceptable to the Bank, and that
the Bank should be furnished with a copy of the studies undertaken and
given opportunity to comment on the findings which should then be
implemented. About seven man years of foreign consultants will be retained
according to procedures acceptable to the Bank.
4.11      Open-pit mines accounted for 49% of CIL production during
1983/84.  The operating efficiency of (?en-pit mines has been a matter of
concern to the Bank. As noted earlier .para. 4.07), a program of technical
assistance was agreed in the loan for the Dudhichua Project, and its
implementation is due to start in early 1985.

4.12      Coal beneficiation operations of CIL include 15 washeries, and
all of them except one process coking coals for the steel industry. The
main objective of this beneficiation is to reduce the ash content of coking
coals. As discussed earlier (para. 2.11) the quality of the washed coal
delivered to steel plants has deteriorated in the past, and CIL has been
implementing measures to change this trend, and some achievements have been
made during the current fiscal year. During 1983/84 15.4 million tons of
raw coking coals were beneficiated in CIL's washeries,14/ yielding 9.2
millicn tons of washed coal.
4.13      In 1983/84, CIL provided employment to 655,300 personnel.  The
composition of the staff is as follows:
CIL - Staffing 1983/84
Category                                Staff     X

Source: CIL.
4.14      CIL directly operates seven central training centers specialized
in management, open-pit and underground technologies and coal
beneficiation. In addition, the subsidiary companies operate sixteen
regional training centers covering managerial, technical and vocational
training activities plus about fifty area training centers for vocational
and statutory safety courses. During 1983/84, the training program in
these centers comprised about 5,000 courses given to 103,000 participants,
of which about 88Z were workers, and the rest managerial and supervisory
staff. CIL's training activities have been strengthened over the past
several years through a program of foreign collaboration including, most
impotldntiy.. the British coal industry. However, while training activities
for certain skills or functions have been developed, there is no
comprehensive overview of training needs and how they should be met.
Furthermore, the overall training functions is badly understaffed. The
Bank has diseo_ssed with CIL measures to improve the effectiveness of the
training function, particularly in the light of the impact of the
investment program on the skills of the labor force over the next five to
ten years. During these discussions it became apparent that improvements
in training are only a part of a much broader issue related to manpower
planning at all levels of the CIL organization. CIL has acknowledged the
need to improve its manpower planning and is preparing information on its
present capabilities and requirements. This should be available early in
1985 and will provide the basis for assistance which could be included in
the proposed Gevra Coal Expansion Project.
14/ Raw coal was also fed directly to the steel mills, was sent to coking
ovens for non-steel consumers and was fed to two non-CIL washeries.

4.16      Up to 1980/81, CIL had been in a loss situation, which derived
from a low level of coal prices and an emphasis on increasing production
without due regard to cost effectiveness. This trend was reversed in
1981/82 when CIL showed for the first time an acceptable income statement
with adequate levels of internal cash generation, long-term debt service
coverage and current ratio. The financial position improved further during
1982/83. However, during 1983/84 CIL showed a financial loss and
consequently a deterioration of the main financial indicators due to the
back-dating of a national wage and salary settlement associated with a new
four year collective bargaining contract. The wage settlement was
finalized in December 1983 and an offsetting price increase was made in
January 1984. However, the wage award was back-dated to January 1983
causing a large loss for CIL which was financed by delaying debt repayment
to GOI. The budgeted re.sults for the current financial year (1984/85)
envisage a return to a financial position similar to that of 1982/83.
Preliminary results for the first quarter are positive and a profit of
about Rs 555 million is expected for the full year.



-20-
4.17      The accounts of CIL, as well as its subsidiaries, are audited
annually by statutory auditors (a partnership of independent chartered
accountants) appointed by the Government of India in consultation with the
Comptrolle-. and Auditor General of India. These arrangements are
satisfactory. Statutory auditors are appointed for a period of three years
at the end of which they must be changed. At the completion of their
audit, the statutory auditors express their opinion on the fairness of the
financial statements, which is included in the Company's annual report.
The auditing standards and procedures followed are those laid down by the
Indian Institute of Chertered Accountants. An additional audit is
conducted by the Audit Board of the Office of the Comptroller and =ditor
General of India. This is both a financial and a management audit and the
comments of the Audit Board are also published with the financial
statements of CIL.
B. Bharat Coking Coal Ltd. (BCCL)
4.18      BCCL is the subsidiary of CIL which is responsible for the
development and operation of the Jharia Coking Coal Project. BCCL is the
main producer of coking coal in India, accounting during 1983/84 for 52% of
the total coking coal production and all of the prime coking coal. BCCL's
headquarters are in Dhanbad, in the state of Bihar.  At present, BCCL
operates about 100 coal mines, organized in 37 mining areas grouped in two
operating divisions. Additionally BCCL owns and operates nine washeries
and another three are planned to be constructed during the Seventh Plan.
4.19      During 1983/84, BCCL produced 21.6 mi'llion tons of run-of-mine
coal, of which 13.6 million tons were coking coals (63%). Underground
mining accounted for 65% of BCCL's production, which is significantly
higher than the average for CIL (51%). This, and the difficult geological
conditions result in relatively higher operating costs of BCCL's mine
compared with other subsidiaries.1 /  During 1983/84, the average
operating expenditures of BCCL were Rs 234 per ton of saleable coal, which
was 44% higher than CIL's average, whereas the average revenues were only
20% above the group's average.
4.20      BCCL is currently in a relatively weak financial position.
Although efforts have been made consistently for many years to improve the
efficiency of BCCL's operations, BCCL's higher operating costs resulted in
heavy losses during the late 1970s and early 1980s leading to large losses
and a concommitant decline in management morale and control. During
1982/83, part of the funds channelled for covering BCCL's financing
requirements were converted into equity. This measure, together with the
retention pricing system (para. 3.10), resulted in an improved internal
cash generation. At the same time BCCL managemnent effectiveness increased
notably.  The financial situation deteriorated somewhat during 1983/84, as
was the case for the entire CIL group due to a belated price revision
(para. 4.16). However, during 1984/85 BCCL is expected to improve its
financial position as shown in the table below.
15/ Stowing operations for controlling subsidence in densely populated
areas, particularly in Jharia, contribute importantly to the higher
operating costs.

5.01      The proposed project fits in directly with both GOI's coal
overall development strategy (para. 2.05) and GOI's coking coal development
plans increasing output, recovery of reserves and productivity (para.
2.09). Both mining complexes form part of the master plan to restructure
the Jharia coalfield which is the main source of prime coking coal for the
steel industry. The Open Cast Block II complex is the first of the
medium/large scale open-pit mines to be developed as part of the Jharia
Reconstruction Plan and by 1989/90 will account for about 11% of prime
coking coal p _uction (2.5 million tpy raw coal). When completed, the
Pootkee Bulliary complex will be the largest underground mining operation
to be implemented in India (3.0 million tpy raw coal). Both projects will
utilize highly mechanized mining system for which Bank assistance will be
provided. The project, thus will provide for increased productivity,
higher output and improved recoveries, and lower production costs. The
project will also extend the Bank's assistance into three important areas
relating to (i) underground mine operating practices (improved procedures
for ui&derground mining using highly mechanized equipment - para. 4.10),
(ii) shaft sinking (improved efficiency through better organization and
more modern equipment para. 5.20), and (iii) transportation of stowing
materials (study of alternative modes of transportation of sand for stowing
(para. 5.19)). Both mining operations should, thus, improve the overall
operating efficiency of BCCL.
5.02      The project should also help improve the quality of coking coal
supplies to the steel industry thus contributing to GOI's objectives of
improving coal quality. This will be accomplished, on the one hand,
through the development of a sector-wide action program to improve coking
coal quality (paras. 3.10 and 3.11) and, on the other hand, because of the
superior quality of final product of the project compared with present
supplies of washed prime coking coal. The final product will be washed



-22-
coking coal with significantly lower ash content (17%) than the current
avera,e supply to the steel sector (20-21%).  The lower ash coal will also
help co improve the operational efficiency and cost effectiveness of the
blast furnaces in the steel plants. Further, the project will help to
reduce the need for imported coking coals and thus contribute to conserve
scarce foreign exchange. The project will also support follow-up on the
coal transportation and producer/linkage studies being undertaken under the
Dudhichua project.
B. Project Description
1.   Scope
5.03      The project 5cope comprises the development of -ne open-pit mine
and one anderground mine with design capacities of 2.5 and ..0 mty of raw
coal respectively, two coal washeries, coal handling plants and surface
infrastructure including railway spurs, workshops, warehouses, offices and
town sites. Total annual output of washed prime coking coal for the steel
industry will be 2.6 million tons when both mines are operating at full
--^pacity. Two new vertical shafts will be constructed for the underground
mine. The project also includes measures to improve coking coal quality
and technical assistance for mechanized underground mining operations,
shaft design and sinking techniques, and sand transportation.
2. Location, Geology and Reserves
5.04      Block II open-pit mine and Pootkee-Bulliary underground mine will
both be located in the Jharia coalfield in Dhanbad district of Bihar
(Map 18594). In 1978 a master plan was prepared for the reconstruction of
the total Jharia coalfield Chart 1 and 9 blocks were delineated as suitable
for open-pit mining methods and 21 blocks were to be mined with underground
methods. The coalfield is today characterized by a great number of
small-scale underground mines and open-pit operations in coal seam
outcrops. The topography is fairly flat at an altitude of about 200 m
above sea level. The area is drained towards the South in the rainy season
mainly by the Damodar river. The infrastructure is well developed and the
coalfield is rather densely populated with Dhanbad being the major town.
5.05      The climate of the Jharia coalfield is tropical with very hot
summer months (March-June) with temperatures reaching 50C (122F). In the
winter (November-February) the temperature can be as low as 3C (380F).
The average annual precipitation is recorded to be about 1,350 mm out of
which 95% falls in the monsoon season (June-September).
5.06      The Jharia coalfield covers an area of about 453 km2 and the rock
types are in a broad fashion classified in two main groups, i.e., the
basement Archaean Gneissic Complex and the Permo-Carboniferous sediments
with the coal bearing strata and partings consisting of sandstone and
shale. The strike of the formation is generally east to west and the dip
7-15 towards south.



-23-
5.07      The first geological mapping was completed in 1930.  This was
followed by an update and resurvey in 1956 and a major drilling campaign
took place in 1977/78 under supervision of CMPDI and the Geological Survey
of India. Total proven and indicated reserves are estimated at about 4.0
billion tons. Exploration work and proven reserves for the two project
components are summarized in table below:

Source: CIL.
The project areas are tectonically disturbed by a number of faults.
However, the available geological and hydrogeological information derived
from exploration work and operating open-pit and unierground mines is
considered sufficient for the purpose of mine design and reserve
calculation. At proposed mining rates the reserves allow for 17 and 33
years of production for Block II and Pootkee-Bulliary respectively.
3.   Open Cast Block II Mining Complex
5.08      The open-pit mine of the Block II complex will have an overall
stripping ratio of 4.1 m3/ton of coal and a depth of 220 m in its final
stage. The mine has been designed for an annual capacity of 2.5 million
tons of raw coking coal with an ash content of about 30X and a 17 year
life. The coal is classified as washery grade IV. The coking coal
measures are underlain by a series of thermal coal seams at depths which
are uneconomic to mine at this date and which could only be recovered by
spoil rehandling in the future.
5.09      Overburden will be blasted and removed bo three draglines,
assisted by forty-four 85 ton trucks and four 11 m3 shovels. Coal, after
drilling and blasting, will be loaded by hydraulic shovels and hauled by 40
ton bottom dump truicks to a crusher station from where the raw coal will be
moved to the washery by conveyor. Coal release will start very shortly
after start of excavation. Mine planning has been done in sufficient
details for the feasibility purpose, but needs some further refinements
with respect to geotechnical testing to confirm validity of applied slope
stability parameters and safety factors. This testing has been initiated
and will be undertaken by India School of Mines in Dhanbad. CIL and BCCL
have agreed that the testing be completed and the results be reviewed with
the Bank not later than December 31, 1985.



-24-
5.10      The selection of the main mining equipment for overburden is
basically sound. Also, given the circumstances of the presence of thin
seams, tectonic faulting and old mine workings, the selection of hydraulic
shovels for coal loading is a technically optimal solution period. BCCL
has prepared training and maintenance programs associated with these
machines which are considered satisfactory.
5.11      Mine development work and in pit road maintenance winl be
performed by a fleet of dozers, graders and wheel loaders. A main sump and
associated pump installations for proper pit drainage will be constructed
ahead of the main haulage road construction and bench preparation in order
to ensure proper drainage. The estimate of required pump capacity which is
based on available rain statistics and experience of ground water
occurrences in other adjacent operating mines appears to be adequate.
Overall final pit slope is estimated at 450 assuming a safety factor of 2.
While this is reasonable, based on experience to date, it should be
finalized following the geotechnical testing (para. 5.09).
5.12      Block II coal will be processed in the Madhuband washery being
implemented by BCCL and for which global tenders for a turnkey contract
have been received. The washery component comprises a washing plant with
stockpiling facilities at a new railhead, and a 2.5 km long overland belt
conveyor connecting a primary crushing station, located on the pit rim,
with the washing plant. The capacity will be 2.5 million tpy of raw coal
and the yield of clean coking coal, with a 17% maximum ash content, i.s 45%
or 1.125 million tpy washed coal. The methodology applied for designing
the flowsheet is satisfactory. Disposal of the rejects has not been dealt
with in a satisfactory manner and warrants further detailed study and
BCCL has agreed to complete the necessary study before December 31, 1985.
Washed coal will be transported by the railway system to the steel plants.
At present, the bulk of the output has been earmarked for the neighboring
Bokaro steelworks about 30 km away.
5.13      The mine, the washery and related industrial facilities will work
300 days per year, 3 shifts per day and 8 hours per shift. The total
manpower requirements at full production level of 2.5 million tpy of raw
coal are summarized in the table below.

-25-
BCCL wil prepare a training program for Block II/Madhuband staff by July,
1986. Thereafter, an annual training report will be submitted to the Bank
on July 1 of each year addressing the previous fiscal year's training
results compared with the annual target.
5.14      Infrastructure facilities such as maintenance, warehouse and
service facilities of adequate size and capacity will be built north of the
open-pit and adjacent to the washery site Chart 2. Water requirements,
installed electrical load, annual power consumption and specified power
consumption are given below.
Block II Mine and Washery - Water and Power Requirements
Mine        Washery

Installed electrical load, MW                26             8
5.15      Three different schemes have been designed for the provision of
water from the nearby Jamunia River or Damodar River and at negotiations
confirmation should be sought from BCCL on which scheme will be
implemented. For Block II three electrical sub-stations totalling 52 MVA,
are proposed in addition to the existing 20 MVA Madhuband substation which
is being fed directly from the DVC grid. There is a shortage of power in
the Jharia area and grid reliability factors are reportediv as low as 67%.
The peak load requirements for the dragline operation effectively rule out
the use of captive power stations. BCCL has reached an agreement with DVC
to supp'ly power directly to the mining complex and a direct power line is
under erection. This arrangement is satisfactory. in addition, it is
planned that one of a series of new 210 MW units, to be constructed in the
early 1990s at Mejia, will be used to meet evolving requirements of coal
mines and establishments in the Eastern Region, including the Jharia
Coalfield.
5.16      Provision of housing and service facilities for the workforce is
guided by CIL policies. Consequently 833 and 381 residential houses will
be constructed for the workforces of the mine and the washery
respectively. Service facilities will consist of, e.g., schools, hospital
and community center. These arrangements are considered satisfactory.
BCCL has agreed to provide the Bank, not later than June 30, 1985 with a
final schedule for the construction of housing and service facilities.
4. Pootkee Bulliary Mining Complex
5.17      The proposed Pootkee-Bulliary underground mine is being developed
in Blocks 4 and 5 (Chart 1) of the Jharia coalfield to produce 3 million
tpy raw coking coal. This mine is second to the adjacent Moonidih mine in
terms of major underground mine development and rationalization as



-26-
envisaged in the Jharia master plan. Development work will produce minor
amounts of coal already from the beginning of major underground work in
1985. Production build up is gradual and full capacity of 3 million tpy
raw coal will be reached in 1995/96. The coal is classified as Washery
Grade II.
5.18      About 52Z of the coal will be mined by fully mechanized
retreating longwall mining techniques and the balance by conventional
retreating longwall techniques combined with stowing to prevent surface
subsidence. Thick seams will be mined in two lifts using wire mesh as
artificial roof. At full production 6 fully mechanized and 12 conventional
faces will be in operation. Stowing material (sand, gravel, crushed rock)
is in short supply in the Jharia coalfield and the medium/long term
availability of sufficient quantities of material is contingent on CIL
undertaking a proposed sand development projects at Maithon and Durgapur
located about 40 km and 100 km from the coalfield, respectively.
5.19      BCCL has agreed to retain, by December 31, 1985, technical
assistance to examine alternative trarsportation modes including slurry
pipelines.  The scope of work has been agreed as outlined in Annex 8.  It
has been agreed that this technical assistance will be financed with the
proposed loan. Betwen two to three manyears of foreign consultants will be
retained according to procedures acceptable to the Bank. The Bank will be
furnished with a copy of the studies to be undertaken and given opportunity
to comment on the findings.
5.20      Access to the mine will be through nine existing shafts (for
material transport, and ventilation) and two new 500 m deep shafts (for
coal hoisting) now being sunk with Polish technical assistance. The shafts
are part of an extensive shaft sinking program required for the
reconstruction of the Jharia coalfield. Slippage has occurred in several
underground mining projects including Pootkee-Bulliary due to overly
optimistic shaft sinking schedules. Shaft sinking has been planned at a
rate of 20 m per month whereas progress is generally in the order of
12-14 m per month. In order to provide for improvement in shaft sinking
productivity, GOI will initiate a study by June 30, 1986, to improve shaft
sinking organizational set-up and introduce more efficient equipment. In
view of the advanced state, this study will not directly impact the
Pootkee-Bulliary shaft sinking; it will, however, be applicable to several
other projects in Jharia and elsewhere where future shaft sinking is
planned. A scope of work has been agreed as outlined in Annex 9. The Bank
should be furnished with a copy of the studies undertaken and given
opportunity to comment on the findings which should then be implemented.



-27-
5.21      The shafts in the Pootkee-Bulliary mine will be connected on two
main levels, about 350 m and 450 m below the surface respectively, through
roadways for coal and rock haulage on rail, and personnel/material
transport. The risk for spontaneous combustion and the presence of methane
gas (particularly in the upper seam) has in general been duly considered
when selecting mining method and designing the ventilation systems. The
mine design is considered satisfactory subject to finalizing optimal face
and panel lengths which will be undertaken as part of the underground
technical assistance as outlined in para. 4.10 and Annex 6.
5.22      The raw coal wilL be washed in a proposed new Pootkee washery
which will be implemented by BCCL and totally integrated with the mine's
surface installations at the site of the two new shafts. The washery
comprises a plant with facilities for crushing/screening, heavy media
separation, flotation and dewacering. The capacity will be 3 million tpy
of raw coal and the yield of clean coal with 17% ash content is according
to pilot plant tests 49% (1.47 million tpy clean coal).
5.23      As is standard in CIL/BCCL practice all industrial facilities and
production units will work on a 300 days per year, 3 shifts per day and 8
hours per day schedule. However, in order to ensure design output, the
mine will have four overlapping 8-hour coal production shifts per day to
increase the net productive hours available. Total manpower requirements
at full production is estimated to be:

BCCL will prepare a training plan for Pootkee-Bulliary staff before July 1,
1986 and thereafter submit yearly progress reports comparable to those for
Block II (para. 5.13).
5.24      Adequate storage and maintenance facilities will be constructed
close to the two new shafts Chart 3 where offices and personnel service
buildings will also be located (the main office is now under
construction). The table below gives the specifics of water and power
requirements:

Installed Electrical Load, MW                          75      8.5
BCCL has confirmed satisfactory arrangements for the supply of electrical
power and potable water for the Pootkee Bulliary mining complex.
5.25      The washery will receive water from the Damodar river which has
an adequate flow at all times.
5.26      Electrical power will be supplied directly from DVC's, main grid
sub-station at Pootkee which is being extended to cope with the new load.
In addition, the Pootkee-Bulliary mine would benefit from back-up power
from 2xlO MW units proposed for construction at Monidih which should
provide adequate emergency power for mine pumping and other needs in the
event of disruption to the main power supply.
5.27      A township for the Pootkee mine and washery personnel will be
constructed (for the mine about 3400 and for the washery about 500
dwellings) plus community center with shops, guest house, schools and other
service facilities. Such arrangements are considered satisfactory. BCCL
has agreed to provide the Bank, not later than December 31, 1985, with a
final schedule for the construction of housing and service facilities.
5. Environment and Safety
5.28      The planning of environmental protection measures to be
undertaken is vested in CMPDI and guided mainly by the Water (Prevention
and Control of Pollution) Act of 1974 and the Air (Prevention and Control
of Pollution) Act of 1981. Both acts prescribe measures and tolerance
limits tb t are in line with acceptable standards in the industry.
Environmental management is the responsibility of CIL through its
subsidiaries. In general, water and air pollution problems are not
expected to be severe. Water and air quality will be monitored regularly
and dust, the major pollution hazard, will be controlled by adequate
measures (ventilation, suppression/extraction equipment). CIL and BCCL
will ensure that the design, construction and operation of the project are
carried out with due regard to ecological, environmental and safety
standards satisfactory to the Bank.
5.29      The land which will be affected by the mining activities is
characterized as forest land although very arid. Only very small
quantities of topsoil are present and soil conservation will be done
whenever feasible. Erosion control and prevention measures, such as



-29-
placing of rip rap, turfing and revegetation will be undertaken on waste
dumps and exposed slopes. This will also assist in reducing surface water
run off. These measures will be done in consultation with the Soil
Conservation Department and the Forest Department of the State Government
as well as the Environmental Research Institute of Forest Research Station
in Dehadrun.
5.30      Mine safety and related operational practices and design criteria
are laid down in the "Mines Act- of 1952 and the "Coal Mines Regulations"
of 1956 supported by monthly circulars from the Director General of Mine
Safety, Ministry of Energy as well as Acts regulating human health and mine
rescue work. They appear to be adequate. The responsibility to follow the
regulations is vested in the safety organization in each subsidiary and on
a cooperative level a "Safety Board," chaired by the Chairman, CIL is
meeting quarterly to review adequacy of current safety practices and to
introduce corrective actions whenever necessary. Although the overall
accident rate in CIL greatly improved from 1973 to 1983 (fatality rate down
44% and serious injuries down 63%) the rates in CIL and BCCL are relatively
high when compared with other major coal producing industrial countries.
This is mainly attributable to very labor intensive, multisean mining
methods with a low degree of support form modern mechanical and electrical
systems in most underground mines. Further, the great number of working
places and large number of workers makes proper safety supervision/manage-
ment cumbersome particularly during periods of rapid expansions. The
project, Which involves a high degree of mechanization, with modern
equipment, has adequate safety conditions but to further assist BCCL the
technical assistance program (para. 4.10) will strongly emphasize the
safety aspect both from design and management standpoints. In order to
satisfy the Bank of the adequacy of safety measures and the incidence of
occupational diseases, BCCL will make available to the Bank every six
months beginning January 1, 1986, statistics on mine-related accidents and
occupational diseases.
C. Project Execution and Implementation
5.31      The project components will be implemented by BCCL under the
direction of two Project General Managers reporting to the Project Director
of BCCL.  Each Project Management Unit is comprised of staff from BCCL and
CMPDI. and the organization is shown in Annex 10. The Project General
Manager is supported by managers responsible for (i) mining and general
engineering; (ii) cost and scheduling control; (iii) administration; and
(iv) a Deputy Project General Manager, directly responsible for project
implementation. In each case total organization comprises about 200
positions which are fully staffed and mobilized. The Project General
Manager for each of the project components has been appointed and both are
considered adequately qualified and experienced. BCCL agreed to ensure
that the organizational structure, staffing, powers and responsibilities of
each Project Management Unit shall be such as necessary for timely and
efficient implementatior. of the project.



-30-
5.32      Some strengthening is required in procedures for project
monitoring and control. To this effect, BCCL will prepare by September 30,
1985 and by December 31, 1985 project implementation manuals for the Open
Cast Block II mining complex and the Pootkee-Bulliary mining complex
respectively according to terms of reference agreed with the Bank, and
exchange views with the Bank on the said manuals and subsequently adopt
them by December 31, 1985 and March 31, 1986 respectively.
5.33      Each Project Management Unit will be directly responsible for all
activities related to detailed engineering, procurement of local goods
(excluding mining equipment) and services, equipment erection and
commissioning, construction and mine development. Procurement of mining
equipment and other imported items will be carried out by the CIL Central
Procurement Organization, in direct collaboration with the Project General
Managers with progress reports provided to the BCCL Project Director and to
the CIL Project Monitoring Unit. A detailed and satisfactory schedule for
immediate procurement actions has been prepared and procurement documents
have been reviewed by the Bank. In the Dudhichua Project the experience
has been that procurement has not been a cause of delay in project
implementation. In order to minimize the impact of external factors GOI
has agreed to promptly grant permission to import foreign goods required
for the project and to promptly make available the foreign exchange
required.
5.34      The implementation schedule for the project is given in Annexes
11 and 12. This has been based on a detailed analysis of interrelationship
of different activities and is found to be realistic. Acquisition of the
first dragline and hydraulic shovel, trucks and dumpers are on the critical
path for Block II open cast mine. The schedule for these is considered
realistic. Due to land acquisition difficulties the Madhuband washery has
been relocated and will be constructed on land presently in BCCL's
possession adjacent to the proposed crusher house complex. At the Block II
mine site, land is currently available for carrying out mining operations
up to 1989/90. BCCL agreed to take possession of the balance of the land
required for the rest of the mine life (i.e., until 2001/2) before
September 30, 1988. This is considered realistic in the light of progress
during the past eighteen months on land acquisition.
5.35      Overburden removal for Block II started in 1982 with temporarily
assigned equipment. Access roads, temporary residential buildings,
maintenance facilities and office/service buildings have been constructed.
Sufficient electrical power for construction as well as water are available
at the site. During 1983/84, about 400,000 m3 of overburden was removed
and about 19,000 tons of coal mined by a fleet consisting of one 4.6 m3
shovel and four 50-ton trucks assisted by dozers, drills and frontend
loaders. One 10 m3 shovel and fourteen 85-ton trucks are being erected on



-31-
the site and the plan for 1984/85 calls for removal of 1.4 million m3 of
overburden and completion of the initial stage (dragline bench preparation)
by March/April 1985. Since certain items of equipment will be required in
advance of the Bank financed equipment, BCCL will provide alternative
equipment as necessary to meet the planned equipment deployment schedule.
5.36      At the Pootkee-Bulliary mine, shaft sinking operations started by
mid-1983, and the two new shafts were respectively about 32% and 18Z
complete in September 1984. This activity and underground development work
is on the construction critical path. Rates of progress for these
activities were reviewed in detail. The present implementation schedule is
considered satisfactory and takes into account realistic rates for shaft
sinking and advance rate for horizontal development work. The Pootkee
washery has been approved by the CIL Board and submitted to the Public
Investment Board (PIB) for approval. This is expected by April 1985. The
Government has agreed to ensure that all necessary approvals are issued by
July 1, 1985.
5.37      Based on the schedule for deployment of mining equipment and
underground development, the Block II and Pootkee-Bulliary are expected to
reach the final capacity of 2.5 and 3.0 million tpy of raw coal in 1987/88

6.02            The Project's base capital cost estimates were prepared by Q4PDI
and are based on cost information related to recent orders for similar
_,.quipment and actual cost data for on-going projects and are found to be
satisfactory. The original estimate as of 1982 was updated subsequently in
1983 and most recently in January 1985. The cost for outside technical
assistance (for design and operational aspects in underground mines, and
sand transportation) including fees, travel and subsistence expenses, has
been estimated on the basis of past experience for similar activities. The
accuracy of the base cost estimate at this stage is considered relatively
high, particularly given the degree of design and specification for mining



-33-
equipment. For this reason, a provision for physical contingencies of 5%
over the base costs is provided for mining equipment and 10% for other cost
items. Price escalation has been based on the phasing of expenditure
consistent with the time schedule for implementing the project and
projected local and foreign escalation. Local inflation rates have been
projected at 8.5% for 1984/85-1990/91 and 6% for years thereafter.
International inflation rates are projected at 3.5% for 1984, 8.0% for
1985, 9.0% for 1986-88, 7.5% for 1989, and 6.0% for 1990 and thereafter.
6.03      Working capital requirements have been estimated at about US$12
million (Rs 139 million), using realistic assumptions on the level of
current assets and liabilities required by the project until it reaches its
rated capacity (in 1988/89 and 1993/94 for Block II and Pootkee-Bulliary
respectively). Interest during construction has been estimated at US$6.0
million (Rs 71.8 million). Thib allows for capitalization of interest up
to the end of 1985/86, on loans disbursed during that period which is based
on CIL's accounting practices.
6.04      The total capital cost for Block IH open cast mine and washery,
excluding price escalation, working capital and interest during
construction is about US$197 per annual ton of washed coal output. The
cost for Pootkee-Bulliary is about US$203 per annual ton of washed coal
output.
B. Financing Plan
6.05      The financing plan for the project is sommarized as follows:

B.  Long-Term Debt

Total Debt                         348.0         50.0
Total Financing                    696.0         100.0
6.06      According to current Government policy, overall financing of
project costs (including interest during construction, but excluding
working capital) is provided in the ratio of 50% debt and 50% equity.



-34-
Under this formula, the proposed Bank loan for US$248 million would sunply
about 36% of the financing to be provided for the Jharia Coking Coal
Project, with another US$85.8 million coming in the form of long-term debt
from GOI. GOI's approach to co-financing has been to link specific
projects with individual financing sources rather than have different
sources participate in each of several projects. In the case of Jharia,
however, while the Bank will provide the bulk of the foreign firancing,
assistance is also being provided by ODA for a dragline which is being
procured in advance of the Bank loan. With respect to equity contributions
the financial projections of CIL (para. 7.08) indicate that the Company
should be able to generate funds to finance about 19Z of its investment
requirements after debt repayment and provision of increase in working
capital for the period of 1985/86 to 1989/90 and this same proportion has
been applied to the Jharia project. Thus, CIL would provide about US$132.2
million equity out of its internally generated funds and the balance of
about US$215.8 million would come from Government funds.
6.07      It is recommended that the proposed Bank loan of US$248 million
equivalent be made to GOI at the standard Bank interest rate for 20 years,
including five years of grace. This would represent over 90% of the
foreign exchange requirements of the project. GOI's practice is to make
loans to CIL for 15 years, at a nominal interest rate currently of
13.5Z16/ per year and not to grant grace periods. Considering the
project's requirements in terms of its long implementation period and
associated cash flow, it is desirable that a normal grace period be applied
in this case, as has been the practice in other loans to the energy and
industrial sectors. It has been agreed that GOI onlend the funds for a
period of 15 years including a grace period of 5 years at not less than the-
current interest rate noted above. Additionally, in line with present
policy, GOI would assume the foreign exchange risk on the on-lent funds.
The conclusion of a subsidiary loan agreement between GOI and CIL, and a
satisfactory financial arrangement between CIL and BCCL, both under terms
and conditions satisfactory to the Bank are conditions of effectiveness.
6.08      GOI has agreed to provide in a timely manner the debt and equity
requirements indicated above and whatever additional debt and equity funds
which might be needed (in both local and foreign currency) to complete the
Jharia Coking Coal Project promptly.
C. Procurement and Disbursement
6.09      Procurement arrangements are suimmarized in table below:

year) for timely payment.

6.10      Out of a total estimate of 56 packages listed in Annex 14 there
are 10 exceeding US$5.0 million each in value, requiring special review.
The Bank will review all packages exceeding an estimated value of US$3.0
million. This includes 15 packages which constitute over 81% of the value
of all goods financed out of the Bank loan, the balance being subject to
post review. Local manufacturers and contractors are expected to bid for
Bank financed items under the project and a domestic preference of 15% or
the import duty, whichever is less, would be applied in bid evaluation for
eligible equipment and a margin of preference of 7.5% would be granted
eligible civil works contractors. The Local Competitive Bidding (LCB)
mainly consists of locally supplied goods including minor equipment,
materials, civil works and erection of equipment as well as pre-operating
expenditures for initial development work in both mining complexes.
Technical assistance services regarding underground mining and sand
transport will be contracted in accordance with Bank guidelines. A
procurement schedule is shown in Annex 14.

awarded to local suppliers following ICB.
6.12      The disbursement profile (Annex 15) is somewhat slower than the
historical country industrial sector profiles as well as for similar
projects in other countries because of the long gestation period
particularly for the underground mine. The Bank loan is expected to be
fully disbursed by March 31, 1992 when all Bank financed items would have
been physically delivered or completed.
VII. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A.   Coal India Ltd.
7.01      The financial projections for CIL have been made based on
assumptions regarding forecast production and the related investment
program, the structure of production costs and coal prices. Specific
assumptions are given in Annex 16.
7.02       CIL coal production is expected to increase from 121.4 million
tpy in 1983/84 to 230 million tpy in 1992/93, an increase of 108.6 million
tons in 9 years representing an average annual growth rate of 7.3%.

7.03      The projected expansioa of coal production is supported by a
large investment program. Total coal sector investnent during the Seventh
Five-Year Plan (1985/86 to 1989/90) is projected at Rs 60 billion (US$5.0
billion) in 1984/85 terms.
7.04      Financing to CIL has been provided entirely by GOI in the form of
long-term debt and equity from GOI's general budgetary allocations for
capital expenditure, with each covering about 50% of the required
investment. It is expected that GOI will continue to finance 50% of the
investment through long-term debt, and the balance would be partly provided
by CIL from its internal resources and partly from equity contributions.
It is expected that CIL's internal generation of investment resources would
increase from 1% at present to 30% by 1989/90 and 38% for 1990/91 to
1992/93 after debt repayment and provision of increase in working capital.
7.05      CIL's average production costs per ton of raw coal are expected
to decrease from the present level of Rs 188 per ton (US$15.7) to Rs 177
per ton (US$14.7) in real terms by 1989/90 as shown in the table below.

Along with this marginal decrease in unit production cost, a major change
is envisaged in the cost structure, which is due to the increasing share of
open-pit production and to the capital intensive nature of the investment
program, resulting in improvement in labor productivity. This provides the
reduction in the contribution of salaries and wages which offsets the
increase in depreciation and interest charges, associated with the
increased share of capital intensive mechanized mines.
7.06      CIL's operating costs compare favorably with those of major coal
producing countries, even when the comparison is made on the basis of tons
of coal equivalent (tce)17/ which raises the cost of Indian coals because
of their relatively lower calorific value. This comparison has been made
on the basis of operating costs, i.e., excluding depreciation and interest
charges, since these concepts normally show wide variations for different
producers depending on specific company policies and practices and the tax
legislation of the various countries. The following table compares average
operating costs per tce for producers in selected countries.

South Africa                  3-4       5-8       8-12
It can be noted that CIL average operating costs per tce (at minehead) are
competitive with the lower cost producers in Australia and the United
States and well below the average for producers in those countries. South
African producers have, on average, lower operating costs due primarily to
a lower cost of labor per ton reflecting higher labor productivity as well
as low wage rates (compared with USA and Australia).
7.07      Based on the present coal price schedule effective en of January
8, 1984 and grade-wise production mix of CIL, the average coal price for
CIL in 1984/85 is budgeted as Rs 192.3/ton. In line with GOI's policy
(para. 3.11), the average coal price for CIL has been assumed to increase
marginally in real terms (by 2%) during 1985/86. Thereafter, it is assumed
that average CIL coal prices would generally follow the local inflation
rate. The average coal price in current terms is projected as follows:
17/ 1 tce- 1 ton of coal with a calorific value of 7,000,000 Kcal (i.e.,
coal containing 7,000 Kcal/kg).

7.09      The coal price increase effective as of January 8, 1984 is
sufficient to provide an estimated net income of Rs 555 million for
1984/85. As additional production comes on stream, the ratio of net income
to revenue for CIL is expected to increase from 2.3% to about 9.9X by
1989/90 due to changes in cost structure (para 7.05) and marginal increases
in unit prices in real terms. Accumulated losses are projected to be
completely absorbed by 1989/90, and long-term debt to equity ratio,



-40-
currently at 56:44, is expected to improve to a more conservative level of
42:58 in 1989/90 and stabilize at that level thereafter. Debt service
coverage is broadly satisfactory throughout the period and is not expected
to fall below 1.3 after 1984/85.
7.10      The delay in the 1983/84 coal price increase was exceptional
because of the delay in completing the wage negotiations. However, the
deterioration of the financial position of CIL in 1983/84 (para 4.16)
reinforces the importance of periodic and timely revision of coal prices.
Such coal price increases together with GOI's continuous provision of
financing and CIL's successful implementation of the investment program are
critical to further improving the financial position of the CIL group. The
next price review is expected to take place in March 1985 based on
recommendations from an inter-ministerial working group (para 3.11).  Since
price increases are subject to a cabinet decision, a delay of one or two
months is possible for the 1985 price increase since the government is
newly formed follov-ing elections in December. If the next review were
delayed by three months, the financial projections indicate that CIL's net
income in 1985/86 would drop from Rs 1,571 million to Rs 787 million.
7.11      Agreements have been reached with GOI and CIL on financial
covenants that will ensure that the financing for the project is adequate
and that CIL will follow prudent financial practices and maintain a
satisfactory financial position. Agreements on the project's financing
plan are discussed in paras 6.07-6.08. Regarding the financial position of
CIL, it was agreed for the Dudhichua Project (Loan 2393) that CIL will on a
consolidated basis: (i) maintain a long-term debt to equity ratio not
greater than 60:40; (ii) maintain at all times a current ratio of at least
1.2; and (iii) take all actions necessary to ensure a debt service coverage
of at least 1.3. These same conditions have been agreedfor the Jharia
Project. Additionally, CIL will have its accounts audited, by independent
auditors acceptable to the Bank, and will submit certified copies of its
consolidated financial statements (together with the auditor's report) as
soon as available, but in any case not later than 9 months after the end of
each fiscal year.

7.13      BCCL's production cost for 1984/85 is budgeted at Rs 2491ton, 34%
higher than CIL's average of Rs 188/ton.  However, with the introduction of
the retention price system, implementation of the investment program, which
emphasizes rationalization of existing underground mines, and development
of new open-pit production, BCCL's financial position is expected to
improve. In 1989/90, BCCL is expected to produce about 29 million tons of
coal, which represent an average annual growth of 5% from 1983/84 at an
average operating expenditure of Rs 196 per ton (in 1983/84 terms). Some
mines will require substantial pre-development work and will be in the
early stages of starting up in 1989/90. Such mines will only contribute
small amounts to BCCL's production in the next several years and BCCL's
expected production growth is less than for the other subsidiaries.
Underground mining would still account for most of the production (62%) at
that time. During the 1990s, however, the share of open-pit production
will increase strongly and new production would be increasingly coming from
open-pit mines. The share of coking coal production would remain high at
about 77% of total production.
7.14      As discussed earlier (para 4.04), given CIL powers and
responsibility for decision-making on financial and administrative matters,
and because it borrows from GOI all long-term loans for the Group, CIL was
the primary beneficiary for the Dudhichua loan and is also considered to be
the same for the proposed Jharia loan.  For these reasons no specific
financial covenants have been agreed for BCCL with the exception that BCCL
will have its accounts audited, by independent auditors acceptable to the
Bank and will submit certified copies of its financial statements (together
with the auditor's report) as soon as available but in any case not later
than six months after the end of each fiscal year.

C. Jharia Coking Coal Project
7.15      The operating cost estimates for Jharia Coking Coal Project were
developed by CMPDI and updated to January 1985 based on comparable cost
data of BCCL. The table below shows the estimated operating costs on per
ton of clean coal basis for Block II and Pootkee-Bulliary when both mines
and washeries are operating at full capacity. The difference in total unit
operating costs is primarily attributed to the stowing operation required
in the Pootkee-Bulliary mine.

a/  Average stowing cost over the life of the mine.
7.16      According to the present practice, clean coal prices are
negotiated betweer, subsidiaries of CIL and SAIL on a washery by washery
basis, using a me:hodology which covers the pithead price of raw coal as
input to the washery, royalties and cesses on raw coal, mine to washery
transportation, washery operating cost including depreciation and interest
on working capital, plus 15% return of net fixed assets of the washery and
less credit from middlings. The technical parameters which have critical
impact on the agreed clean coal price (ash content of clean coal, washery
yield, and washery capacity utilization) are reviewed and agreed upon every
year. Penalties are included in the agreement to control the quality
variation of clean coal. Based on this methodology, for 17% ash clean coal
from Block II and Pootkee-Bulliary washeries, the price BCCL can realize
net of royalties, cesses and sales tax, is assessed to be Rs 660 per ton
(US$55 per ton), which is used to derive the benefit stream of the project.
7.17      The financial rate of return for the project is 10.1%.  This is
composed of 12% for Block II and 9% for Pootkee-Bulliary. The difference
is due primarily to the higher operating costs of Pootkee-Buliary (para.
7.15) and to the long implementation period (11 years) for Pootkee-Bulliary
mine to reach designed capacity as compared to 5 years for Block II, which
more than offsets the better coal quality from Pootkee-Bulliary. Detailed



-43-
financial cost and benefit streams and the assumptions used, together with
those of the economic analysis are included in Annex 19. The financial
rates of return and sensitivity tests are summarized below.

Completion delayed by one year             11.0           7.8           8.9
7.18      Of the various factors used in the sensitivity test, coal price
is the most critical. Clean coal price is a function of raw coal price,
which is administered by GOI, and washery operating efficiency. Although
GOI has expressed basic commitment to the agreed pricing approach (para.
2.14), there is some risk that price adjustments may not take place in a
timely manner. In anticipation of this problem, extensive discussions have
taken place with GOI to ensure the financial viability of the project and
CIL. There is also a risk that project revenues could be reduced by delays
in production build-up or by difficulties in reaching full production.
Given CIL's recent achievements in increasing production and implementing
new projects this is not considered a serious risk. For other factors,
while 10% variations cannot be excluded, significant increases in capital
and operating costs are unlikely because estimates are based on cost
information related to recent orders for similar equipment and actual data
for on-going projects. Furthermore, the techaical assistance in open-pit
mine operations (included in the Dudhichua project) and in mechanized
longwall operations (included in the Jharia project) is expected to yield
benefits which ultimately would ensure achievement of full production in a
timely manner as well as lowering operating costs.
VIII. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
8.01      The project has important import substitution benefits.  Prime
coking coal is in short supply in India and imports of 1-2 million tpy
(costing US$70-140 million annually) will be required to meet steel
industry requirements for the next several years. The project would help
contain the need for imports, thereby, saving scarce foreign exchange
resources. Additional benefits will accrue from the project including (i)
the strengthening of BCCL's operational management, particularly in fully
mechanized underground mines, through a program of technical assistance;
and (ii) the improvement of the average coking coal quality delivered to
the steel industry, leading to higher operational efficiency and cost
effectiveness of the Indian steel plants.

A.   Economic Rates of Return
8.02      The economic rates of return have been calculated in real terms
based on the capital and operating costs used for the financial rates of
return, with the following adjustments (i) exclusion of all identifiable
taxes and duties; (ii) application of a standard conversion factor of 0.8
to locally supplied equipment and materials; and (iii) application of a
shadow wage rate of Rs 8 per day (US$0.67 per day), equivalent to 15% of
the negotiated union wage, for unskilled labor participating both in the
construction and future operation of the project; the shadow wage rate is
considered an accurate estimate of the opportunity cost of labor in Eastern
India under conditions of widespread underemployment and unemployment.
8.03      Additionally, benefits for both project components have been
calculated on the basis of projected sales of washed coal and the import
parity of coking coal. As discussed earlier (para 3.11) the appropriate
pricing policy for Indian coking coals is the opportunity cost of imports.
The import parity price has therefore been based on the long term trend
price for imported coking coal from Australia, the logical foreign
supplier. The current CIF price has been estimated at US$70 per ton for a
medium/high volatile, low sulphur, 10% ash coking coal, and this has been
assumed to remain constant in real terms during the evaluation period.
Current Bank projections for thermal coals are to increase slightly (up to
1% per year) in real term in the long run; the above assumption for coking
coal can therefore be regarded as on the conservative side. This CIF price
was adjusted for handling, in-land transportation costs (port to
steelworks, and washery to steelworks) and quality differentials vis-a-vis
the washed coal from the project. 18/ The net-back parity ex-washery is
estimated at Rs 689 per ton (US$57.4 per ton), and is taken to be the same
for the washed coal produced by both mining complexes, since they will be
of the same quality.
8.04      Based on the above estimates the economic rate of return for the
Jharia Coking Coal Project is 21.5%. The Block II and Pootkee-Bulliary
components have been projected at 28% and 17%, respectively. The rates of
return and sensitivity tests are summarized below and underlying
assumptions and cost and benefit streams are detailed in Annex 17. An
analysis of switching values for key parameters indicates that the economic
rate of return for the Jharia project would decline to 12% (which is
considered to be the cost of capital in India) if (a) capital costs
increased by 55%, (b) operating costs increased by 63% or (c) revenues
declined by 24%. The economic rate of return is most sensitive to a
decline in revenues which might be caused by lower than projected
production or by inadequate price increases. As noted in para. 7.18 such
risks are not considered excessive.
18/ These adjustments (in Rs/ton) are: Port-handling 45, transport from
unloading port to steelworks 154, transport from washery to steelworks
80, and quality differential between in favor of imported coal (with
10Z ash) as compared to washed Jharia coal (with 17% ash) 270.

a/ In the case of Block II only the washery is delayed by one
year; in the case of Pootkee both washery and mine are
delayed by one year.
8.05      The major reason for the dif ferences between the economic and
financial rates of return is the elimination of custom duties on. imported
equipment (currently averaging 742 of CIF value).  The main consequence of
the difference is that a substantial portion of the economic rent of the
project accrues to the government (through taxes), suppliers and to the
work force (through high wages compared to alternative occupations) rather
than to CIL. It can also be noted that the difference between the economic
rates of return for both components widens compared with the financial
rates of return. This is mainly due to Block II having a higher foreign
exchange component in the capital costs, and consequently the elimination
of custom duties has a larger impact.
B.  Additional Benefits
8.06      The project represents a major technological step in the
introduction of medium/large-scale open-pit exploitation and large-scale
fully mechanized underground mining techniques for expanding the supply of
prime coking coal. Additionally, washeries are being designed to produce
clean coal with an ash content of 17%, significantly lower than the average
of prime coking coals presently delivered to the steel industry. This will
have an important impact on the productivity of blast furnace operations,
particularly in terms of increased throughput and a better performance in
terms of reducing the consumption of coal per ton of hot metal produced.
8.07      The project will provide direct employment for about 8,500
persons and will lead to additional employment opportunities through
contractors and suppliers.
C.   Least Cost Program
8.08      The economic rate of return calculations presented above are
based on evaluating the import-substitution effect of the project;
therefore, they provide a measure of the component's marginal contribution
to the economy, enabling comparison with investments in other sectors of



-46-
the economy. The question may arise, however, whether these project
components rank favorably compared with alternative investments for
expanding the production of prime coking coal.
8.09      As mentioned earlier, the Jharia coalfield provides all of the
domestic prime coking coal used by the steel industry, and both components
form part of the master plan for the reconstruction of the coalfield.
Generally speaking, open-pit mines compare favorably to underground mines
as investment opportunities. Block II and Pootkee-Bulliary are no
exception to this rule. Block II is the first medium/large-scale open-pit
operation in Jharia to be developed. It has a relatively favorable
stripping ratio and a fast production build-up. Furthermore the mine site
is located in one of the least densely populated areas of Jharia, reducing
the need for relocation of existing buildings and settlements. Since it
could be developed in a relatively short period of time, CIL selected Block
II as the first open-pit operation in Jharia.
8.10      With regard to the development of underground mines, a first
group of five mines, with a combined rated output of 3.8 million tpy of
washed coal, are at various stages of implementation (Sudamdih, Moonidih,
Katras, Bhutgoria and Murulidih). The marginal costl / for these mines
ranged between Rs 420 and Rs 480 per ton of washed ioal.  Presently, a
second group of four mines is proposed for development including
Pootkee-Bulliary. While the marginal cost of production at
Pootkee-Bulliary (Rs 536 per ton of washed coal) is projected to be higher
than in the mines currently under implementation in Jharia, it is lower
than any other prospective new underground mine In that field.
IX. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
9.01      The following agreements have been reached
(a)  With the Government that it will:
(i)   maintain coal prices that will ensure the financial

INDIA - JHARIA COKING COAL PROJECT
STEEL SECTOR
1.   Background
1.        Steel production in India is provided by six integrated steel
plants and over one hundred small mini-mills. Five of the integrated
plants are owned and operated by the government-owned Steel Authority of
India (SAIL) (including the IISCO plant - a wholly owned subsidiary of
SAIL) and one by the privately owned TISCO). The steel sector is
administered by the Department of Steel (DOS), Ministry of Steel and Mines
which is responsible for policy making, planning and development of the
Iron and steel sector including setting up new plants as well as for
overseeing existing production, distribution, pricing, import and export of
iron and steel.
2"        The Bank's involvement in the steel sector, to date, has been
through five Bank lending operations from the mid 1950s to the mid 1960s to
TISCO and IISCO, and through IFC lending operations for the construction of
a special steel production unit (1963, plus expansions in 1974 and 1978)
and an expansion of the TISCO integrated steel works (1980).           -
2.   Steel Production, Consumption and Trade
3.        During most of the 1970s, the Indian steel industry was able to
supply the domestic market at internationally competitive prices and with
the exception of a few specific products, India was self-sufficient in
steel production. However, production from the integrated steel plants,
measured in terms of hot metal output from the blast furnace, reached a
peak of 9.9 million tons in 1976/77. Subsequently, the industry
experienced a variety of operating difficulties compounded by bottlenecks
in the supply of critical inputs such as power and coking coal, and
production stagnated as shown in the table below.

In 1981/82 and 1982/83 the SAIL plants achieved over 90% of their targeted
production although capacity utilization was only about 70%. The
difference between the production target and installed capacity largely
reflects known bottlenecks which effectively limit production capacity.
The GOI has set a high priority on measures to alleviate such bottlenecks
although progress so far has been slow.
4.        An adequate supply of steel is essential to the future
development of many basic sectors in the economy such as construction,
engineering, mining, manufacturing and transportation. The major uses of
steel are for construction and in the engineering industries. Steel
consumption grew slowly in the 1960s - at only 3.3% per year, but averaged
6.6% per year in the 1970s. Even so, India has very modest steel
consumption compared to other countries. For example, per capita
consumption of finished steel is about 20 kg/per capita in India compared
with about 150 kg/per capita in newly industrializing LDCs such as Brazil
and Mexico, and 500-600 kg/per capita in industrialized countries.
5.        In the mid 1970s India was a net exporter of steel products.  In
the past five years, however, exports have been minor and an average of
about 1 million tons of steel imports have been required annually to meet
domestic consumer's needs.

3.   Steel Prices and Financial Position
6.        Prices for mild (low-carbon) steel products are set by the Joint
Plant Committee (JPC) which consists of representatives of the major steel
producers and the Railway Board, under the chairmanship of the
Government-appointed Iron and Steel Controller. Presently, JPC prices are
uniform at all railhead destinations in India although consideration is
being given to setting prices to reflect differential transport costs to
specific locations. Prices of medium- and high-carbon steels and most
special quality steel products are set by market forces. During most of
the 1970s, Indian steel prices were generally lower than comparable
imports. But a severe recession in the international steel market in the



-51-                         ANNEX 1
Page 3 of 8
1970s resulted in import prices declining sharply and in late 1978, JPC
introduced levies on certain imported steels to offset the difference to
consumers between low priced imports and higher domestic steel prices. The
latest JPC Base price list for various steel products is given at the end
of this Annex. At present international steel prices are depressed and
Indian prices are up to one half higher than currently prevailing
international prices for most steel products and in some cases even
double. International steel prices are expected to strengthen in the next
several years as worldwide market conditions improve and the price
differential vis-a-vis domestic prices should be narrowed providing Indian
steel producers are effective in implementing measures to reduce costs.
7.        Up until 1981/82 both SAIL and TISCO operated profitably.  In
1982/83 while TISCO made small profits, SAIL suffered losses which derived
primarily from a substantial increase in financial charges. Summarized
Income statements for the period 1979/80 - 1982/83 are shown below:

8.        While differences exist in terms of assets and product mix, the
ability of TISCO to remain profitable is indicative that SAIL could also
operate profitably without substantial changes to steel prices.
In order to rectify SAIL's situation, SAIL and GOI are undertaking measures
to re-establish SAIL's financial viability. The main emphasis is to
improve cost effectiveness by rationalization and other cost reduction
measures and to make full use of existing assets by improving capacity
utilization through a de-bottlenecking period. The Jharia coking coal
project should contribute to improving SAIL's financial situation since the
increase in quantity and quality of PCC that should result from the project
(para. 3.10) should provide important improvements in blast furnace
productivity. Improved blast furnace operations will contribute to
reducing costs and increasing production thereby both improving the



-52-                         ANNEX 1
Page 4 of 8
financial performance of SAIL and assisting the domestic steel sector to
meet domestic steel demand without the need for steel imports.
4.   Development Priorities
9.        GOI's basic strategy for the steel sector is to emphasize
increased efficiency and de-bottlenecking at existing plants together with
improvement in infrastructure supplies. Specifically, the major priorities
are (a) to undertake the necessary investment to complete the expansion of
the SAIL plants at Bhilai and Bokaro from 2.5 million tpy to about 3.5
million tpy hot metal production each; (b) to implement measures to reduce
costs, improve efficiency and rationalize production at the other SAIL
plants; (c) to undertake a program of construction of captive thermal power
stations for each of the integrated steel plants to shield them from future
power shortages; and (d) to ensure adequate availability of satisfactory
quality coking coal. In addition, one new steel plant to meet expected
demand growth is in the early stages of construction at Vizag with
assistance fom the USSR. Another greenfield project, planned at Paradip
with U.K. assistance, has been postponed. The investment program with its
emphasis on improved efficiency should assist the industry in improving its
cost efficiency and competitiveness in the future.
10.       The expansion and rationalization of existing SAIL plants is
planned to increase hot metal production from 7.4 million tons in 1983/84
to 10.8 million toas in 1989/90. In addition, production by TISCO is
projected to increase from 1.9 million tpy hot metal 1983/84 to 2.3 million
tpy in 1989/90. Production from the new plant at Vizag is projected to
reach 1.65 million tons hot metal by 1989/90 giving a total Indian hot
metal production of 14.7 million tpy in 1989/90 as shown below. This
should be sufficient to meet domestic demand providing the new plant at
Vizag is kept on schedule and the improvements are successfully completed
at the SAIL plants.

To determine the most economic and technically feasible mode of
transporting sand to be used for stowing in Jharia Coalfield from Maithon
and Durgapur.
B. Scope of Work
The consultant should examine (a) the technical feasibility,
environmental and safety implications and (b) the economics of different
modes of transport for given quantities of sand including, as appropriate,
rail, road, ropeway and pipeline from (i) Maithon to Jharia and (ii)
Durgapur to Jharia and make recommendations regarding the preferred mode.
In particular the study should cover the following areas:
a)   Technical:  The consultant should study the technical feasibility
and environmental and safety aspects of each mode of transport
and should point out any major technical difficulties or risks
that may arise. For slurry pipelines, the consultant should
confirm the technical feasibility given the characteristics of
the sand, the route, availability of water, etc. and make
recommendations regarding routing, location and specification of
pumping stations, pipeline specifications, source and disposal of
water, etc. To the extent necessary the consultants should
undertake any necessary physical tests to confirm the technical
feasibility of slurry pipelines. For rail, the consultants
should examine the suitability of any existing facilities and
presently-used equipment and address the benefits and feasibility
of improving present facilities and equipment and/or developing
new rail lines including optimal wagon and locomotive
specifications. For road, the consultants should examine the
suitability of using existing roads including maximum size of
trucks to be used, traffic congestion and safety implications.
The consultants should also examine possible road improvements
and/or the development of new roads as well as the use of
different vehicle sizes. Ropevays, in the case of Maithon, the
consultants should also examine the possible use of ropeways,
including optimal routing. In all cases the consultants should
specify the point and means of loading sand in Maithon and
Durgapur and discharging at Jharia.

ANNEX 8
Page 2 of 2
b)   Economics:  The consultants should provide an estimate of the
delivered cost of sand for all cases considered. The cost
estimates should be based on conceptual engineering. Foreign and
local costs should be separated and operating and investment
costs should be specified together with manpower requirement.
Economic comparisons will include discounted cash flow and net
present value calculations (both excluding inflation) with
adjustments made to exclude taxes, and use appropriate conversion
factors. Financial comparisons should be made, including
inflation and taxes of the investment requirements.
c)   Timing:  It is estimated that the work will require two to three
man-years effort.

A.   Projection Period
1.        The financial projections have been prepared for 1984/85 through
1992/93.
B.   Escalation
2.        All projections have been prepared in current terms assuming the
following local inflation rates:
FY 1984/85 to 1990/91        8.5%
1991/92 and thereafter   6.0%
C.   Production Plan
3.        Production plan for the CIL group is based on CIL's projaction
adjusted according to availability of investment funds and the projects'
implementation outlook. The adjusted production plan is given in the
following table.

E.   Coal Prices
5.        The projected average coal price for CIL (ex-mine) has been
assumed to increase in real terms by 2% in 1985/86 so chat, in any year,
the full cost o0E --oduction (including depreciation and interest) would be
covered, and by 1989/90, CIL would earn a 10% return on net worth, if it
meets specified efficiency norms regarding production levels, output per
manshift and unit operating costs. For years thereafter, it is assumed
that average coal price for CIL would follow the local inflation rate. The
projections are as follows:
CIL - Averag Coal Price
(Rs/tc - 1984/85 ters)
Fiscal Year    184/85  1985/86  1986/87 1987/88  1988/89  1989/90 1990/91 1991192  992193

F.   Production Costs
6.        Salaries & wages, including base salaries & wages plus social
amenities and fringe benefits (calculated at 21% of the base salaries and
wages), have been increased by 29% in real terms from 1984/85 to 1992/93,
representing an average annual growth of 3.2% and explained by the
following factors:
-  increase in the number of employees         10.2%
-  increase in the base salaries & wages       14.5Z
-  chernge in the composition of labor          2.2%
In calculating the base salaries and wages for each employee category a 7%
increase in real terms has been assumed in 1987/88 and 1991/92 due to the
scheduled renewal of CIL's labor contracts.
7.        Administrative overhead a major portion of which (about 70%) is
administrative salaries, is assumed to increase at the same rate as the
salaries and wages.
8.        Stores. power, transportation of coal, sand and other materials,
and other costs/revenues are calculated on a variable cost basis. The unit
cost for stores, which includes spares, explosives, timber, diesel fuel,
lubricants aiid other general operating materials, have been slightl,
increased from the base dute to the increase in open-pit production with
higher than average material consumption. All other variable unit costs
have been assumed to remain constant throughout the projection period.
9.        Dpreciation has been calculated using the 1983/84 figure as a

10.       Interest expense has been calculated based on the following
average annual interest rates:
Existing long-term loans a/
- planned portion                  11.5Z p.a.
- non-planned portion b/            0.OZ p.a.
New long-term loans c/                   13.52 p.a.
Short-term loans                         18.0% p.a.
a/ Loans taken before April 1, 1984.
b/ A subsidy equal to the interest payable is received from the
Government.  Hence neither interest nor subsidy are included in the
financial projections.
c/ Loans taken in 1984/85 and thereafter, which is about 48% of annual
investment, repaid in 15 years.
G.   Income Taxes
11.       Accumulated losses from previous years have been carried
forward. In addition, an investment allowance, up to 40% of the annual
investment, has been assumed in calculating the annual taxable income. A
50% income tax rate has been applied to the taxable income (if any).
H.   Balance Sheet
12. Current assets have been increased from the base at the same rate as
the growth in total operating expenditures.
13.       Current liabilities have been assumed to follow generally the
same pattern as current assets. However, since labor costs are expected to
increase and only moderately, other current liabilities (which include
mainly wages and bonuses payable at the end of the year) have been
increased at a lower rate than the average growth in operating
expenditures.
14.       Fixed assets haze been increased by adding 80% of the annual
investment to the previous year's balance. This addition is assumed to
include both the direct addition from the annual investment and a transfer
from previous year's capital work-in-progress. 17% of the investment has
been assumed to equal the net increase in capital work-in progress and 3%
of the investment. the net increase in loan & advances.
15.       Long-term debt outstanding March 31, 1984 for CIL overall
consists of the following loans:
Planned          Rs 14,947 million
Non-planned      Rs  4,326 million
Total          Rs 19,273 million

FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC RATES OF RETURN - ASSUMPTIONS AND CALCULATIONS
Introduction
1.        The financial rate of return (FRR) and economic rate of return
(ERR) for Block II and Pootkee-Bulliary have been calculated in real terms
on an annual basis.  According to mineable reserves and production profile
of each mine, Block II has a life of 19 years starting 1983/84 while a
period of 30 years starting 1984/85 it; taken as the life of
Pootkee-Bulliary. Cost and benefit streams of each component are shown in
tables attached.
Cost Streams
2.        Capital Costs are based on project implementation schedule and
equipment deployment plan. Replacement investments are estimated according
to useful life of major equipment deployed.
3.        Operating Costs are derived from production schedule together
with fixed and variable cost components of the mining and washiLg
operations.
4.        Working Capital requirement is derived taking into consideration
the level of minimum cash, inventory of consumables, stock of coal,
receivables and rayables. This is equivalent to 2 months of mining and
washing operating expenditure.
Conversion Factors
5.        For the calculation of ERR, all identifiable duties and taxes are
excluded. In addition, to refle-t the concept of opportunity cost, the
following conversion factors are applied to each category of cost.>':
Conversion Factor                   Category of Costs
1.00            Imported Equipment (CIF)
0.80            Inland Freight and Erection of Imported Equipment
0.77            Local Equipment
0.80            Land, Civil Works and Infrastru'--
1.00            Engineering and Training
0.80            Pre-operating and Operating Costs (including a
shadow wage rate of 0.6 for unskilled labor).

Revenue Stream
6.        For the financial rate of return, the revenue stream is derived
based on clean coal sales volume and ex-vashery clean coal price net of
royalties, cesses, sales tax and credit of middlings, i.e., the net benefit
which will accrue to BCCL. Based on mutually agreed methodology, the net
price for 17% ash clean coal from Block II and Pootkee-Bulliary washeries
is assessed at Rs 660/ton. For Pootkee-Bulliary, sales revenue is adjusted
upward by 5% for the first 10 years of full production to reflect the
better than average quality of run-of-mine coal in that period. In
addition, stowing rebate is added to the sales revenue to derive total
revenue.
7.        For the economic rate of return, as domestic coking coal can be
directly substituted for imported coking coal, the net-back price of
imported coking coal after quality adjustment, currently at about
Rs 689/ton, is used to derive the revenue.
