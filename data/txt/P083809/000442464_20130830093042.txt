F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
 
The project's development objective is to create sustainable conditions for enterprise creation and
growth that responds to local and export markets. The project, which will reduce the cost of
doing business and encourage investment, will enable the private sector to be better positioned to
respond to opportunities in specific categories of the market. The project will increase the
number of formal enterprises, the number of people employed and the number of skilled
employees leading to an increase in output per worker.  
 
Project Development Objectives (as noted in the Development Credit Agreement)

The objective of the Project is to support the Borrower's efforts for creation of sustainable
conditions conducive to enterprise development and growth, encouraging investment,
facilitating private sector development, increasing micro, small and medium enterprises,
increasing competitiveness in local and export market, and employment opportunities in its
territory, through: (a) reduction of the cost of doing business; and (b) improvement of business
environment and public-private dialogue.

1.    Project Context, Development Objectives, and Design

1.1    Context at Appraisal

Country and Macroeconomic Context

1.      Over the decade proceeding preparation of the Second Private Sector Competitiveness
Project (PSCP II) in 2003, sound overall macroeconomic management, improvements in the
regulatory environment, and financial sector restructuring along with relative political stability
provided a sound basis for private sector growth and led to an improvement in Uganda’s
standing in the Africa’s Business Competitiveness Index (ranked 13th in Africa in the 2003-2004
Global Competitiveness Report). The Ugandan private sector was characterized by a large
degree of informality and poor competitiveness. A 2004 Investment Climate Assessment
underlined key constraints to private sector growth, specifically high interest rates and the cost of
financing. The increases in interest rates were caused by public sector deficits and the high costs
of operating in the financial sector. Although the main factor leading to high interest rates was
explained by the Government’s monetary policy to control inflation, financial institutions
reported a wide range of issues. These included: insecure collateral, low payment morale, and a
lack of appropriate instruments to fit small-client needs, all of which contributed to the high cost
of administering loans, in particular to micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs).

2.      The Government’s poverty strategy emphasized the need to transform the economy
through private investment, industrialization, and exports. The Government’s Poverty
Eradication Action Plan focused on two keys areas to enhance incomes: (i) MSMEs engaged in
off-farm manufacturing and service provision; and (ii) small-holder agriculture. Consistent with
this objective, the Government’s Medium-Term Competitiveness Strategy detailed key reform
priorities and policies. Reform priorities included: commercial law and its application; the
regulatory and administrative framework governing business transactions; land registration; and
improvements in infrastructure services, including the regulatory framework for utilities.

3.      In order to achieve the objectives of the Poverty Eradication Action Plan, the aim was to
increase exports by 10 percent per year. Lack of export growth had been considered a
fundamental weakness of the Ugandan economy; fluctuations in export revenues reflected the
vulnerability of the Ugandan export economy caused by a lack of diversification and a
dependency on commodity markets (primarily coffee, tea, and cotton). Supporting the growth of
other commodity exports (such as vanilla and horticulture) was meant to increase revenue in the
short term. In the medium term, however, diversification was considered a priority especially
related to higher value added manufactured goods and services. This, in turn, entailed developing
exports for specialized markets, such as certified organic products and prepackaged fruits and
flowers.

Sector Background

4.      While the prevailing Medium Term Competitiveness Strategy supported some
improvements in the investment climate, they only led to growth in traditional agricultural and
manufacturing sectors. Uganda’s private sector, particularly MSMEs, was slower to respond to
market opportunities relative to other countries in Africa or Asia. The private sector, including
agriculture, was the major source of employment. In the formal sector non-farm enterprises

                                                 1 
 
 


(estimated at 160,000 firms) employed over 444,000 workers with the majority of workers
employed in MSMEs. Although it was acknowledged that employment figures were inaccurate,
an estimated 300,000 new job seekers per year were needed to be absorbed by the informal
sector, which together with MSMEs accounted for an estimated 1.5 million workers. The
accelerated growth of MSMEs, together with greater mobility from informal to formal status,
was considered important to poverty reduction. The formalization of MSMEs would, among
other benefits, increase their access to financial and technical services.

5.      At the time of project design the key constraints affecting the business environment were:
the inadequate provision of services in the land and business registry; an outdated legal
framework in selected areas; and inefficiencies in trade-related support institutions, including
customs and standards. In addition, there were numerous firm-level constraints facing the private
sector, especially labor productivity and capacity utilization rates which were lower in small
firms. This reflected under-investment in training and limited supply of management skills in
MSMEs. Moreover, larger firms were excessively dependent on vertical integration caused by
the need to develop in-house capacity, even when not the most efficient producer, due to lack
supplier reliability.

6.      Access to land and infrastructure were also major impediments to enterprise growth.
Enterprises surveyed indicated that limited access to land was a key constraint and impeded
expansion in original locations. Existing industrial areas were congested, prone to flooding, and
poorly located from an urban planning perspective. Only 20 percent of the available land was
registered because acquiring clear title was difficult. At the time of project design, access to
telecommunications services and reliability of electricity were also serious issues.

7.      These business development challenges were compounded by the high cost of and limited
access to financing. Although it is noteworthy that reforms had greatly improved the soundness
of the banking sector, these improvements had not yet reduced the cost of financing or increased
lending to the private sector. Commercial banks financed only 13.5 percent of new investments,
mostly to established clients. In addition, the level of risk to lend to MSMEs was perceived as
high, as was the high cost of administering such loans.

8.      Despite these constraints, there were a number of investment opportunities in Uganda
that were producing higher returns compared to other investment locations in Africa. Analysis
had identified a comparative advantage in the production of some grain products and
horticulture. Exports in fish, vanilla, and floriculture were also emerging as major non-traditional
exports. And, opportunities for production of high value-added semi-processed and packaged
agricultural products were also identified.

Rationale for Bank Assistance

9.      As the PSCP II went to the World Bank Executive Board for approval in September
2004, the Uganda Joint Assistance Strategy was under final preparation and was closely aligned
with the Government’s new Poverty Eradication Action Plan. Although PSCP II had not been
explicitly mentioned in the 2000-2003 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), its objectives were
entirely consistent with that CAS as well as the forthcoming Joint Strategy. Specifically, PSCP II
intended to address a core objective of the Poverty Eradication Action Plan -- increase
employment by increasing non-farm and farm-level income opportunities. While poverty

                                                 2 
 
 


assessments confirmed a reduction in non-income poverty and increasing access to education and
health services, income poverty was actually rising. The PSCP II also complemented the ongoing
IDA-financed Poverty Reduction Support Credit which focused mainly on non-income poverty
and strengthening of public institutions that provide services to the private sector.

10.     PSCP II built upon the institutional and policy reforms initiated under the first project
PSCP I1, which sought to improve the business environment by: reducing policy constraints;
strengthening institutions that provide services to the private sector, specifically the Private
Sector Foundation Uganda (PSFU) and the Uganda Investment Agency (UIA); and enhancing
the private-public dialogue. PSCP II also sought to continue support to firms to alleviate
problems associated with inadequate know-how. This would be done through the Business
Uganda Development Scheme (BUDS), considered one of the most successful matching grants
program in Sub-Saharan Africa and which had been established under the PSCP I under the
management of the PSFU. Based on the Implementation Completion Report for PSCP I (June 26,
2003; No 2621) the activities of that project were considered genuinely private sector-driven and
the project met or exceeded all expected outcomes, contributing to a significant increase in FDI.
PSCP I had also supported the establishment of what was considered to be one of the most
dynamic public-private dialogues in Africa.

1.2           Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

11.    PSCP II was intended to create sustainable conditions for enterprise creation and growth
that would respond to local and export markets. As stated in the Project Appraisal Document
(PAD):
              “The overall objective of the project is to create sustainable conditions for enterprise
              creation and growth that responds to local and export markets. The project, which will
              reduce the cost of doing business and encourage investment, will enable the private sector
              to be better positioned to respond to opportunities in specific categories of the market.
              The project will increase the number of formal enterprises, the number of people
              employed and the number of skilled employees leading to an increase in output per
              worker.?

12.   The PDO was worded, however, differently in the legal Development Credit Agreement
(DCA):
              “The objective of the Project is to support the Borrower's efforts for creation of
              sustainable conditions conducive to enterprise development and growth, encouraging
              investment, facilitating private sector development, increasing micro, small and medium
              enterprises, increasing competitiveness in local and export market, and employment
              opportunities in its territory, through: (a) reduction of the cost of doing business; and (b)
              improvement of business environment and public-private dialogue.?

13.     Despite being worded differently, both versions of the PDO emphasize creating
sustainable conditions for enterprise development and growth, reduction in cost of doing
business, and increasing competitiveness in local and export markets. Notwithstanding the fact

that the PAD version of the PDO was the one that was consistently monitored, this
Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR) is obliged to evaluate the PDO as it
appears in the legal agreement.2 In either case, however, the PDO was too high-level. As a
consequence, in many instances it is difficult to attribute the project activities to intermediate
results (discussed in Sections 2.3 and 3.2).

14.     Unfortunately, the key PDO indicators and intermediate outcome indicators were
inconsistently noted and reported. In the PAD there were four key PDO indicators (the original
four are noted with “*? below) and 14 intermediate indicators.3 The final Implementation Status
Results Report (ISR), however, reflected 13 PDO indicators and 22 intermediate indicators, in
part reflecting changes in the indicators formalized during the second restructuring (January
2012). Of the 9 PDO indicators added, a few were core indicators (e.g., female beneficiaries) that
reflected the Bank’s evolving approach to M&E. In addition, one indicator was included in the
second restructuring but was not monitored or noted in the final ISR. For the purposes of this
ICR (including the Data Sheet), the list below of 36 indicators are assessed.




                                                            
2
     Until 2012, all ISRs noted the PDO as it appeared in the PAD. After the second project restructuring in January 2012, the
     ISRs used the PDO as it appeared in the DCA. In any case, the PDO had not been revised.
3
     The DCA did not make any specific reference to the results framework. However, the Project Agreement between the Bank
     and PSFU (dated February 23, 2005) did include performance indicators (generally consistent with the PAD’s intermediate
     result indicators) but did not include the PDO outcome indicators.

1.3    Revised Components and Key Indicators, and Reasons/Justification

15.     The project was restructured twice, in February 2009 and January 2012. The first project
restructuring involved extending the closing date from January 31, 2010 to January 30, 2012 and
made some adjustments (e.g., reallocated funds from “unallocated? category and other
reallocations within the disbursement categories; expanded scope of financial services
component; increased the amount for operating costs by about 27 percent).

16.     For the second restructuring, the project was extended to February 28, 2013. This second
restructuring also reallocated credit proceeds among different disbursement categories. In
addition, it cancelled the Infrastructure Services Component 1.1 due to procurement,
environmental, and management concerns in the construction of the Kampala Industrial Business
Park (KIBP). This reduced the credit amount by US$21.5 million, thus from US$70 million to
US$48.5 million. As a result, only the land development sub-component remained active, which
aimed to complete the high priority Land Information System (LIS) contract of US$11 million.
All the other components were closed on January 30, 2012.

17.     The January 2012 restructuring also sought to formalize changes in project indicators
which were adjusted at the time of the Mid-Term Review in 2008. (See Section 2.3) The PDO
was not revised during the project. As previously noted, however, there were many changes to
the indicators. It is noteworthy that these changes were not formalized until the second
restructuring when all components were closed except the land sub-component. In terms of the
two result indicators associated with the dropped Infrastructure Services sub-component 1.1, one
was maintained (number of firms located in the industrial park) and the other was dropped (land
access and site development reduced from 435 days to 70 days by project end). Overall,
however, it is unclear which indicator changes were actually agreed upon during the Mid-Term
Review versus those introduced later at the time of the second restructuring, since the indicators
in the respective documents do not align.

1.4    Main Beneficiaries

18.     The primary target group for this project, as identified in the PAD, was private
enterprises especially MSMEs. This group was targeted in order to have better access to business
development services and finance and to benefit from an improved investment climate. In
addition, owners of land that were to be registered by the project were also a target beneficiary
group; they would have improved land security and be able to transfer land more quickly.
Women were specifically targeted to benefit from the infrastructure facilities planned for the
industrial zone (sub-component 1.1); this sub-component, however, was cancelled. In addition,
women were targeted by the Enhancing Enterprise Competitiveness (Component 2) and Land
Registration (Component 3) activities.

19.    The other beneficiaries included the implementing agencies and their respective
stakeholders: Ministry of Finance; PSFU; UIA; Ministry of Lands, Housing and Urban
Development; Ministry of Justice; Uganda Law Reform Commission; Bank of Uganda; Uganda
Bureau of Standards; Uganda Registration Services Bureau; and Uganda Securities Exchange.

1.5    Original Components (as approved)

The project funded three components.

20.      Component 1: Developing Infrastructure and Financial Services (US$30 million): The
objective of this first component was to provide priority infrastructure and related facilities to
support the growth of the industrial and business sector, particularly through enhancing the
availability of serviced industrial land in a modern, well-planned industrial park. The project
included the development of serviced industrial land and improvements in the provision of
financial services. This was to be achieved by: (i) providing infrastructure facilities in the form
of serviced land for primarily industrial and business activities at a new industrial park at
Namanve located 11 kilometers east of Kampala (KIBP); and (ii) supporting financial
institutions with institutional building grants to develop and introduce products suitable for
MSMEs.

21.    Component 2: Enhancing Enterprise Competitiveness (US$14 million): This component
aimed to improve enterprise creation and growth, particularly in MSMEs, by changing enterprise
behavior toward investment in skills (especially for women), raising productivity and improving
the quality, standards, and reliability of MSME producers participating in export value chains.
This was to be achieved by scaling-up the ongoing matching grant scheme implemented
successfully under the PSCP I. In addition, new schemes were to be developed to target: (i)
improving technology; (ii) improving skills; (iii) supporting creation innovative products and
new lines of business by providing grants through a business plan competition scheme; and (iv)
improving financial management of MSMEs to help increase their access to finance.

22.     Component 3: Improving the Business Environment (US$26 million): This project
component sought to strengthen the underlying legal, regulatory, and institutional structures. It
addressed critical issues in the business environment, including: (i) the land registry; (ii) the
business registry; (iii) the Uganda Bureau of Standards; and (iv) the commercial legal reform
process. In addition, it sought to strengthen the public-private sector partnership and dialogue
started under the PSCP I. This was also to encompass the transformation of the privatization unit
within the Ministry of Finance and the preparation of PPP legislative and regulatory framework.

2.    Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1    Project Preparation, Design, and Quality at Entry

       Note: A Quality Assessment of Lending Portfolio (QALP) review on this project was
       prepared, dated April 28, 2008. The likelihood of achieving development outcomes was
       rated as 3 (moderately unlikely), before implementation of the review’s
       recommendations, and 2 (moderately likely) after recommendations were to be taken on
       board.

23.    When the project was prepared there was limited available space in the country’s lending
program. Hence, Bank country and sector management needed to decide whether to focus on just
a few private sector-related constraints – a Specific Investment Loan, or take a more
comprehensive approach by addressing a broader set of issues – a programmatic lending

                                                7 
 
 


instrument and sector wide approach. A programmatic support program was rejected since the
government had not yet prioritized the various reforms, policies, and activities. Given the focus
on technical assistance, training, and physical investment needed at that time, the SIL instrument
was considered a better option. Moreover, there was also a desire by Bank management at the
time to consolidate activities into larger projects in order to achieve administrative efficiencies.
This dilemma was a factor in the design of other projects in the Africa private sector
development portfolio. The SIL approach, adopted by PSCP II, carried less leverage for policy
reform than a programmatic approach. Notwithstanding this fact or perhaps because of it, the
project design proved to be complex. The three components encompassed a broad range of
activities -- infrastructure, enterprise reforms, land reform, legal framework, and advocacy -- any
of which could have been a project in its own right.

24.     During project preparation attention was given to ensuring that the design reflected the
lessons learned from the Bank’s experience in Uganda and other Sub-Saharan African countries,
as well as global practices. For the infrastructure sub-component 1.1 encompassing an industrial
zone and export processing zone, the project design sought to incorporate best practice principles
based on the experience in Africa. In this regard, the design reflected the global trend towards
privately developed and managed zones with the role of the public sector clearly defined as
regulator and facilitator. It also recognized the importance of sufficient demand for such zones in
line with the market for industrial land, the macroeconomic environment, and the investment
climate. The need for a clear strategy for promotion and development of such zones was also
emphasized. But seeking to emulate the successful experience in other regions, specifically in
East Asia, also proved to be a double-edged sword. Following a study-tour relatively early on in
project implementation, the UIA changed its vision for the KIBP based on experience in East
Asia which reflected the ‘gold standard’ for fast growing economies, yet not necessarily
appropriate for the Uganda context.

25.     Irrespective of whether the change in design made sense for the Uganda context, the
change in the construction site expanded the scope beyond the availability of project financing.
(The new design was quite different than what had been originally envisaged and consequently
was estimated at nearly four times the original amount of US$400,000.) It also led to serious
implementation problems including environmental safeguard issues as a result in change of the
site. (See Sections 2.2 and 2.4) In designing the project, environmental impacts were considered
and it was determined that the project should be classified as Category B. Section 2.4 below
discusses whether it may have been more appropriate for the project to have received a Category
A rating instead, which would have involved greater scrutiny at the outset and during
implementation.

26.    In designing the MSMEs-related components (Component 2), the project drew on the
experience, instruments, and partnerships that underpinned the Joint IDA-IFC MSME Program
for Africa, a collaborative initiative between the World Bank (IDA), the International Finance
Corporation (IFC), and bilateral donors. In particular, in cases where the private sector
contributes to the cost of the technical assistance (at least a 50-50 basis), it was shown that
programs tend to encourage the continued use of technical support and the development of local
consulting firms. The importance of demand-driven vocational and skills development oriented
toward practical needs of enterprises was also incorporated.



                                                 8 
 
 


27.    For the Component 3 activities aimed to improve the business environment, the project
design was informed by FIAS reports which emphasized the need for reforms to be underpinned
by surveys and quantitative methods to be closely monitored by the public and private sectors.
Unfortunately, despite the intention this lesson was not actually appreciated (no doubt made
more difficult by a weak results framework). One lesson associated with the business
environment that actually was integrated during project implementation was the importance of
improving service delivery, specifically for services related to land and business registration.

28.     The Government had pushed hard to include the land registration activities (sub-
component 3.1) despite the Bank’s initial concern that the land issue was too complicated and
susceptible to corruption. But this risk paid off; the land component was among the most
successful of the project. (See Section 3.2) While not all the necessary aspects were fully
prepared prior to approval, not unusual for many projects, the land components were generally
sufficiently developed by the time of effectiveness.

29.    The PAD identified three key fiduciary risks as: corruption; shortfall in Government
funding obligations; and inadequate internal audit function. The other risks that were identified
included: sustained adequate commitment to policy reforms and institutions’ willingness to
change; Parliament passing necessary reforms to reduce administrative and regulatory barriers;
continued evolution of the private sector development agenda; sufficient cooperation amongst
donors; private associations continuing to work with PSFU as the “apex? institution; MSMEs
being responsive to incentives and willing to seek external assistance; and, adequate power
generation capacity for the planned industrial park. The project design sought to mitigate most of
these risks. But several of these risks did manifest and had serious implications for the
implementation and outcome of the project as discussed in this ICR.

30.     But while most of the beneficiary agencies had been consulted about the design (but not
fully in the case with sub- component 1.2, however), their ownership of the project was never
assured. This was because these agencies were restricted to just the basic implementation of the
activities and had very limited role in procurement and the selection of consultants. While this
was the preferred model by the Ministry of Finance at that time, it resulted in these agencies
never really owning the design or feeling responsible for the outputs particularly when the
quality of the consultant’s output was considered poor. Also emerging as a challenge was the fact
that the implementing agency – in charge of managing the delivery of the public sector entities –
was a private sector organization. While this may generally be a good model, the associated risk
mitigation measure -- a strong overall project governance function – failed to transpire.

31.     From the beginning Government leadership was strongly committed to the project,
referring to it as its ‘pet project’. Indeed, at several points pressure was put on the various
implementing agencies to get things moving. But the flip side of this was the risk of political
capture. This may have been evident in the behavior of the original project management as well
as the controversial land pricing policy for KIBP.

2.2    Implementation (See Annex 2 for detailed list of outputs)

Overall Implementation

32.    The project was approved in September 2004 and became effective in June 2005. Similar
to PSCP I, the implementation arrangements followed prevailing practice whereby beneficiaries
were expected to substantially manage their own sub-component. Financial management,
procurement, monitoring and evaluation capacity were provided by a centralized project
management unit, the PSFU, which was formally delegated responsibility by the Ministry of
Finance, Planning and Economic Development (the Borrower).

33.     In addition to its overall project coordination role, the PSFU was also directly responsible
for implementing sub-component 1.2 (Financial Services to MSMEs) and Component 2
(Enhancing Enterprise Competitiveness) under its Business Uganda Development Services
(BUDS) program which had previously been established with support of PSCP I. The UIA was
responsible for sub-component 1.1 (infrastructure services component related to KIBP). The
relevant beneficiary institutions provided the technical supervision of activities under
Component 3 (the business environment), including the Uganda National Bureau of Standards
(UNBS), Uganda Registration Services Bureau (URSB), Uganda Law Reform Commission
(ULRC), and the Ministry of Lands, Housing and Urban Development. To provide policy
guidance and oversight a Project Steering Committee (PSC) was established led by the Ministry
of Finance, Planning and Economic Development and composed of the Permanent Secretaries
responsible for the respective project components and private sector representatives. The
responsibilities of the PSC were to approve the annual work and procurement plans and to
regularly assess project performance, including ensuring that any recommendations from
financial and operational audits were adopted.

34.     Notwithstanding these arrangements, project implementation got off to a very slow start.
This was caused, in part, to the significant delay in Parliament’s approval of the project which
did not happen until May 2005. This delayed project effectiveness by several months to June
2005. Even though these delays provided more time for PSFU and UIA to gear up, they still
lacked readiness for implementation. Although the PSFU did have experience with the PSCP I
and the institutional capacity for financial management was judged sufficient initially, the
delayed recruitment of an internal auditor significantly impacted its capacity. For procurement,
the lack of capacity in both PSFU and UIA was identified at the outset and was rated as high risk
in the PAD. It was only during the third year of the project that full-scale project implementation
started to happen. The initial delay was never made up and the closing date of the project was
extended twice, eventually to February 2013. Also as a consequence of the delays, project costs
increased beyond design estimates which impacted efficiency.

35.     The lack of implementation readiness was compounded by a weak governance structure
for the project. Inadequate management and weak oversight by PSFU allowed improper behavior
by the procurement specialist to go unchecked. (See Section 2.4) In 2011 the PSFU project
coordinator and procurement specialist were relieved of their duties. Notwithstanding its
coordinating role, PSFU was also somewhat lax about overseeing the activities of the
implementing agencies which, as a result, got late starts. Nor did the Project Steering Committee,
chaired by the Ministry of Finance, fulfill its role as envisaged. Up until 2011 the PSC had only
met twice, even though it was required to meet at least two times each year. The Government

                                                10 
 
 


eventually committed to hold regular PSC meetings to keep implementation firmly on track. This
resulted in about a dozen PSC meetings over the final two year implementation period.

36.    The project was downgraded to problem status in June 2010, where it remained until
October 2011. This downgrade was attributed to the delays and problems especially related to
the KIBP (sub-component 1.1) and land reform activities (sub-component 3.1), discussed below.

Component 1: Developing Infrastructure and Financial Services

37.     Sub-component 1.1 (KIBP): There were several issues that plagued the implementation of
this activity. Foremost was the weak capacity of UIA to effectively manage the component,
especially related to civil works. A senior technical advisor was put in place to assist UIA but
that was not sufficient. The first phase involved the construction of the UIA office and
completion of earthworks (a second phase would procure the construction of the roads within
KIBP). During this period, UIA undertook investment promotion efforts and succeeded in
attracting a substantial number of businesses in multiple sectors; over 300 projects had been
proposed and screened, even in the absence of a marketing effort abroad.

38.     Despite this marketing accomplishment, serious problems emerged when the location of
the UIA-KIBP office block, resident engineer’s office, and a laboratory was changed on the
KIBP site. This reflected the enhanced design following the East Asia study tour. Although the
study tour was meant to focus on the “soft? aspects of industrial park management, it nonetheless
served as the genesis for expanding the design. However, the more ambitious design
significantly increased costs and had environmental implications. (See Section 2.4) Not only was
the contract subject to prior review, the Bank’s no-objection was not sought until the building
was nearly complete. In February 2010, the Bank declined to give its no-objection based on these
problems.

39.    In addition to the “hard? aspects, there were several issues related to the “soft? aspects of
developing KIBP, specifically the controversial land pricing policy. Contrary to what had been
envisaged in the design – that land sales in the first phase would finance the next phase – the
Government indicated its desire to give free land for priority sectors. The pricing policy
continued to evolve by selling the non-priority industrial plots at a uniform price but this still
created a shortfall in KIBP revenue. Government agreed to finance the shortfalls (approximately
US$20 million).

40.     Remedial measures were identified to address the problems related to KIBP which led to
the restructuring all staff in the UIA. However, implementing all the recommendations would
have taken about three years, which was well beyond a reasonable project extension period.
Accordingly, through discussions with the Bank, the Government decided to cancel the KIBP
activity in November 2011. There has been some criticism directed at the Bank that it should
have been engaged earlier and more assertively on the emerging problems, such as the issue of
land pricing and procurement of civil works. Indeed, the final Task Team Leader expressed the
view that if the project had been appropriately restructured right when these problems emerged,
the outcome would have been more positive. (The February 2009 restructuring did not address
the KIBP issues.)

41.     Sub-component 1.2 (Deepening Financial Sector Services): The financial sector
deepening program experienced a late start due to the eligibility criteria that restricted public or
quasi-public agencies from benefitting (regulated financial institutions, non-bank financier
service providers, and industry financial associations). This was eventually addressed.
Nonetheless, there was an initial lack of coordination and collaboration amongst the various
stakeholders in the financial sector. In this respect, the project design had not been sufficiently
participatory. Moreover, because the component originally envisaged building and leveraging on
other donor funded programs (EU, DANIDA, DFID, and USAID) and these programs closed,
there was excessive demand on the sub-component that had not been anticipated. In response,
during Mid-Term Review in 2008 the scope of the financial services sub-component was
expanded.

Component 2: Enhancing Enterprise Competitiveness

42.     Sub-components 2.1 - 2.4 (Matching Grant Scheme, Technology Acquisition Fund,
Enterprise Skills Linkage, Business Brand Linkages Program, Better Business Behavior Award
Scheme): The various activities under this Component generally performed well throughout the
project. Component 2 was actually rated highly satisfactory in December 2007 in view of the fact
that the matching grant component was almost fully disbursed and that the number of
beneficiaries had already exceeded the target. For the Better Business Behavior Award Scheme
sub-component (awarding subsidies to bank clients who pay on time), there was such a strong
interest on behalf of the banks that they took over the program without further project support.
Thus that activity was eventually cancelled.

Component 3: Improving the Business Environment

43.     Sub-component 3.1 (Land Registration): Although the land component was appropriately
developed by project effectiveness, the first two years of project implementation were dedicated
to detailed preparation and refinement of methodologies, baseline studies, and putting in place
other arrangements. Nevertheless, the late start for this sub-component can largely be attributed
to the unpreparedness of the Ministry of Lands. Because of the delay, a two-year project
extension (to February 2013) was ultimately required in order to complete the land information
system, which was itself delayed due to the need to rebid given the low level of initial interest.
Implementation was also negatively impacted by the determination (based on an INT
investigation) of fraudulent procurement practices related to the construction of two land offices.
In addition, mis-procurement remains under consideration, related to the firm selected to survey
government land, based on non-responsiveness to the bid submitted. (See Section 2.4)

44.      Sub-component 3.2 (Business Registration): Activities related to improving business
registration in the Uganda Registration Services Bureau (URSB) performed unsatisfactorily until
late in the project. Significant progress began following the appointment of a new URSB Board
in 2011. With a new governance structure in place, PSCP II was able to effectively support
change management and institutional modernization in URSB.

45.    Sub-component 3.3 (Standards): The activities related to reform of the Uganda National
Bureau of Standards also performed unsatisfactorily until 2011, primarily attributed to lengthy
procurement delays. Unfortunately, because of the compressed time frame, the scope of activities
was curtailed.

                                                12 
 
 



46.     Sub-component 3.4 (Legal Framework): The legal framework for business and financial
services sub-component was designed to support the drafting of commercial legislation.
Notwithstanding solid support through the Uganda Law Reform Commission to accelerate the
process, as mid-2010 none of them had become operational because the accompanying
regulations had not been completed and issued by the respective ministries. In large measure, the
delays were attributed to the slow process of debate and approval of bills tabled in Parliament.

47.    Sub-component 3.5 (Public-Private Partnership): This sub-component generally
proceeded as planned.

2.3    Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation, and Utilization

48.      At the outset, the project suffered from very weak arrangements for results monitoring.
(It should be noted, however, that at the time the approach to M&E was an evolving. Hence, an
initially weak M&E framework was not unusual for projects of that era.) There appears to have
been a lot of confusion on the role of the stakeholders in developing the framework. The working
assumption was that each implementing agency was to have developed its own, but clearly this
was not tenable. As a result, no coherent framework emerged until the Mid-Term Review, and
even after it was inconsistently reported and monitored. Moreover, many of the results that were
specified were difficult to attribute to project activities. For example, it is not clear whether some
result indicators like “Exports of traditional [non-traditional] commodities increased? were
because of the project or due to broader conditions (economy, stability of government, trade
legislation, and other exogenous conditions). Similarly, it would not be possible to link project
activities to outcomes like an increase in the credit extended to the private sector as a percentage
of GDP since such an indicator is the result of multiple macroeconomic and public sector
policies, as well as to evolving structural changes in the economy.

49.      Some indicators were difficult to accurately evaluate because the tracking methodology
was incorrect. For instance, the monitoring method for “10,000 new jobs created in the formal
sector? was the incremental number of job advertisements. However, based on the tally from
Component 2 alone, it would seem that this objective was nonetheless met. Several indicators
measured processes, such as “Value of dollars disbursed, BUDS? and “Number of financial and
non-financial matching grants approved?. But these are actually useful intermediate indicators
since they measure the evolving demand and need for services and the willingness of businesses
to pay for them. Nonetheless, it would have been helpful to also focus on more specific and
measurable indicators on firm competitiveness, such as related to firm-level performance (e.g.,
skills, productivity). Overall, the weak results framework made it difficult to effectively monitor
actual progress towards the project’s objectives.

50.     This problem was never corrected during implementation and, in fact, was compounded
by poor monitoring and inconsistent reporting. The outcome indicators reported and monitored
in the ISRs were not fully aligned with the PAD nor with the performance framework in the legal
Project Agreement between the Bank and PSFU, included errors, and lacked explanations for
changes. As noted, some effort was made at the Mid-Term Review in 2008 to improve the results
framework, including providing baseline data for several indicators. However, the net effect was
an expansion of the intermediate indicators to an excessive number (from 14 to 23) and changing
three of the four PDO-level indicators (two of the indicators were removed and replaced by two

                                                 13 
 
 


indicators that had previously been intermediate indicators). The Aide Memoire of the Mid-Term
Review did not elaborate on the changes and there continued to be inconsistencies between the
revised results framework and the subsequent ISRs in terms of the specific indicators monitored.

51.     The Bank’s sector management noted the ISRs’ “highly deficient? discussion on the
performance indicators (in June 2010; ISR #13) and questioned the consistently satisfactory
ratings for M&E. Although the M&E rating was subsequently downgraded to moderately
satisfactory, tracking and updating the indicators continued to be inadequate and the presentation
of the indicators in the ISRs continued to be inconsistent (e.g., intermediate indicators vacillated
between 19 – 23; indicators were randomly listed, not sorted by component, which made it
difficult to understand). The January 2012 restructuring provided an opportunity to rationalize
the framework, albeit with only one year remaining and all but one component closed. But even
after this ISR reporting of indicators appeared unreliable all the way to project closure.

52.     In addition to problems with the results framework, there was a serious deficit in candor
in reporting. This was most apparent in the absence of any discussion in the ISRs of the UIA-
KIBP office construction at a different site, and constructed using larger specifications. The lack
of candor in reporting was noted in the QALP Review which observed that “the ISRs have not
presented in detail all of the issues that have slowed down implementation. More realistic
reporting, both in ISRs and Aid Memoires, would help the task team, Bank management, and the
Borrower address implementation problems.? In terms of the final ISR rating of MU after
previous MS ratings, it appears that the team struggled with the final rating. Although project
performance had really improved over the past two years (as reflected by the relevant MS
ratings), based on a careful review of the outcome for the entire project period the team’s view
was that there wasn’t enough evidence to justify a moderately satisfactory. The final ISR,
however, did leave open the possibility that post-project closing data collection and a pending
enterprise survey could lead to a different conclusion in the ICR; unfortunately, the relevant data
that was available for the ICR exercise did not reverse the final ISR conclusion.

53.    Despite the expectation (noted in the PAD) that there would be an independent
operational audit every two years to provide impact assessment (including firm-level data related
to the matching grants) and thus identify ways to improve project implementation, there was
only one operational audit conducted over the eight year implementation period. The October
2008 operational audit report was produced just prior to the November 2008 Mid-Term Review
mission. No doubt the report provided useful information and recommendations to inform the
Mid-Term Review. It also highlighted the problem of the lack of an integrated M&E framework.

54.     To address the muddling performance regarding M&E, an M&E specialist was recruited
for the PSFU but not until 2009. This resulted in the production of a thorough completion report
on Component 2 in January 2012 which provided useful data and survey responses of MSMEs
that had benefitted from the various interventions. But since the report was produced after all but
one component was closed, it did not inform implementation in any way. Further compounding
the inadequate M&E structure was the fact that the Project Steering Committee was not
performing its oversight function until 2011 when most of the components were ready to close
within the year.

2.4           Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Safeguard Issues

55.     The project was classified as a Category B and an environmental and social impact
assessment was conducted as part of the project design process. There is some question as to
why a Category A rating was not applied instead given that: the project financed greenfield
investments with a heavy infrastructure component; the site was to be constructed near the
capital for which urban planning had not been managed well; the site was also a wet land near
Lake Victoria which supplied the drinking water to Kampala; the land had been previously
classified as a forest reserve; and the industrial park tenants were to include environmentally-
sensitive industries such as pharmaceuticals.4 On top of these challenges, the implementing
agency (UIA) had extremely limited capacity with environmental and social safeguard issues.

56.    The results of the assessment noted these concerns and indicated that they could be
mitigated. Accordingly, the focus was on ensuring that the industrial planning of KIBP
incorporated and mitigated environmental and social impact, to be part of the KIBP Master Plan.
The KIBP Master Plan was prepared in 2008 and included an environmental and social
management framework based on various impact assessments. To oversee this work, UIA
employed a full-time environmental officer and eventually recruited another officer to be
responsible for the social aspects (although the recruitment took one year). Nonetheless, UIA
capacity remained strained in these areas and there were significant delays and repeated
problems regarding environmental and social safeguards.

57.     The most serious problem became apparent in 2009 when the UIA office block and an
early KIBP tenant structure were both found to be inconsistent with the KIBP Master Plan. The
UIA office block, which had been relocated without consultation with the Bank, occupied a
location designated as green space in a wetland area. It also involved significant landfill of up to
five meters in some places. (To ensure proper settlement, normally a landfill is allowed to settle
for a period of up to nine months before construction begins.) This issue was also raised by the
Bank team. In fact, the Bank’s environment-related supervision significantly improved after
2009. Although the relocation of the UIA building had been approved by the National Industrial
Park Planning Commission and may have been based on some degree of justification, the Bank
expressed concern that KIBP was developing inconsistently with its own plans and procedures
for land allocation.

58.    Eventually there was some progress in resolving the outstanding environmental and
safeguard issues and modifying the Master Plan. But it is unfortunate that it took such a long
time to effectively address, which contributed to the decision to cancel the sub-component in
November 2011. It is not clear whether this outcome would have happened even if the project
had been rated a Category A instead of a Category B. However, it is certain that the project
would have been subject to greater scrutiny regarding environmental matters if it had been rated
a Category A (not to mention additional supervision budget). The two project restructurings
provided opportunities to re-classify the project to a Category A. The environmental team
                                                            
4
    The Bank’s approach to assessing a project’s potential environmental impact has evolved significantly since the project was
    designed. Currently, projects that include industrial parks generally receive a Category A rating.

                                                                15 
 
 


acknowledged that it was a “tough call? and ultimately it was a judgment call to maintain it as a
Category B.

59.     Although the KIBP sub-component was cancelled there were some notable
developments. These included the successful provision of piped water to communities adjacent
to the industrial park, improvements in sanitation, and a new soccer field. Also the plan resulted
in the relocation of grave sites to alternative burial grounds in consultation with the communities.

Fiduciary Compliance

60.     Serious procurement and contract management problems arose during project
implementation. Based on an alert from the Bank’s project team, the World Bank’s Integrity
Vice Presidency (INT) investigated allegations of fraud and corruption related to the
procurement of several land-related contracts (sub-component 3.1) and found evidence that
several firms engaged in fraudulent practices while bidding for the contracts. This involved
submission of forged advance payment and performance security guarantees by one firm, M/s
Ayemo, which also abandoned the site, submitted forged “audited? financial statements, and
forged bid securities among others. The investigation also found evidence that the procurement
specialist engaged by PSFU received bribes from some of the firms awarded contracts under the
project. The investigation resulted in the debarment of eight firms and six individuals.5 The
PSFU procurement specialist’s contract was not renewed and the project manager was also
relieved of her duties. In addition, a case of potential mis-procurement continues to be under
review for a contract involving the survey of Government land, based on the incorrect awarding
of the contract. Likewise, the contract involved excessive payment amount for the inception
report and incomplete work. (A reimbursement of IDA funds by the Government was pending at
the time of the preparation of this ICR.)

61.     The procurement-related corruption issues that emerged can be partially attributed to lack
of effective oversight and accountability structures within PSFU. This was aggravated by the
departure of the internal auditor and other staff (reflecting regular turn-over as well as more
attractive opportunities for high caliber staff). The fraud and corruption uncovered in the project
stemmed not only from the failure to follow established procedures and the lack of appropriate
oversight of procurement processes, but also from weak supervision of contract implementation.
The mismanagement of the construction of the UIA office in KIBP and the poor contract
management related to the survey of government land are prime examples. As discussed, there
were significant cost over-runs -- primarily due to the change in design -- in the construction of
the UIA-KIBP office block, resident engineer’s office, and laboratory. Although a supervision
consultant was responsible for overseeing the work, as the implementing agency for that
component UIA did not adequately supervise the consultant nor the contractor. This was because
UIA lacked adequate technical and contract management skills to do so. The Uganda Auditor
General carried out a ‘value for money audit’ in 2011 (at the prompting of the Bank project
team) to determine whether the funds were used properly. The findings indicate that the building
cost was three-and-a-half times the original estimate. (The annual external financial audits were
otherwise all clean.)

                                                                16 
 
 


62.     While UIA acknowledges its failure to have sought the Bank’s prior review and no-
objection to the office block changes, there were also missed opportunities for the Bank task
team to have done site inspections. If more careful and technical supervision had been performed
by the Bank between missions, the issue would have been uncovered earlier instead of when
construction was finished and the final finishes were underway. Indeed, the building was not
very large and was actually built in-between two missions.

63.      Criticism has also been targeted to the Bank for taking considerable time to review
procurement and for being abstruse in the process, particularly related to the no-objection sought
for the KIBP major works (phase two, which followed the preliminary earth works). The Task
Team acknowledged that consideration was lengthy, in part because it required a higher level of
institutional review (by Regional Procurement Management) and also because it was awaiting
the results of the ‘value for money’ audit of the UIA-KIBP office block. In addition, because of
the ongoing fraud and corruption investigation related to the land component, fiduciary concerns
were heightened around the bidding process of the major works contract in sub-component 1.1.
In June 2011 the Bank informed the Borrower that it could not provide its no-objection until the
mitigating measures identified in the audit were put in place. Since this would have required
more time than what remained for the project the Government decided to cancel the KIBP sub-
component.

64.     In response to the fiduciary problems a new PSFU project manager was hired in 2011 and
stronger governance mechanisms were put in place in PSFU, including a board projects
subcommittee and an audit committee. Shortly thereafter the Project Steering Committee also
began to meet and exerted more oversight on activities. Together these measures seemed to have
improved fiduciary oversight and project implementation during the final two years. Based on
the experience of PSCP II, fiduciary-related lessons have been incorporated into a follow-on
project, the Competitiveness and Enterprise Development Project (discussed below).

2.5    Post-completion Operation / Next Phase

65.     Shortly after PSCP II closed a follow-on project was approved by the Bank Board in
April 2013. The Competitiveness and Enterprise Development Project (FY13; US$100 million)
seeks a similar development objective: to improve the competitiveness of enterprises in Uganda
by providing support for the implementation of business environment reforms, including land
administration reform. It also supports the development of priority productive and service
sectors.

66.     The new project will support the continuation and scaling up of the land reforms carried
out under the PSCP II and will help increase land tenure security and reduce the time taken to
transfer land. A number of lessons were drawn from the piloting of innovations and the
implementation of land administration reforms under PSCP II, including: the need for a thorough
review of the legal, policy, and institutional framework as the basis for land reform; success and
sustainability of land administration reforms require a long-term perspective, political
commitment, and concerted support from development partners; and computerization of re-
engineered land administration systems and work flows has proven effective in increasing
efficiency and transparency in land administration. Similarly, the new project will continue
PSCP II-supported reforms aimed at simplification of business registration and business


                                               17 
 
 


licensing procedures. A matching grants facility in priority sectors (tourism and exports of non-
traditional products) will be established to help increase exports and create new jobs.

67.      Like PSCP II, the PSFU will be responsible for overall coordination and management of
activities for the new project. But unlike for PSCP II, the Ministry of Lands will now have direct
responsibility for related activities. To strengthen its capacity, both PSFU and the Ministry of
Lands will benefit from technical advisory services, training, and sufficient operating costs. The
new project also incorporates several measures to manage fraud and corruption risks. The
Government’s oversight function will also be significantly strengthened. This involves a Project
Technical Team whose members include the accounting officers of the beneficiary agencies.
This group will meet on a monthly basis and will report to a Project Steering Committee that is
intended to be much more active, engaged, and accountable. Moreover, the Project Coordinating
Unit (within PSFU) will report to the PSFU management and board. In addition, to address
governance challenges encountered during implementation of the PSCP II, the project will build
in prevention, deterrent, and detection measures through collaboration with the Ugandan
Inspector General. A communications campaign to inform beneficiaries will also help prevent
fraud and corruption.

3.     Assessment of Outcomes

3.1    Relevance of Objectives, Design, and Implementation
Rating: Substantial

68.     The PSCP II objectives were quite relevant when the project was designed. It sought to
support the Government’s poverty reduction and reform strategy to transform the economy
through private investment, industrialization, and exports. In addition to building on the success
of PSCP I, the project complemented the Poverty Reduction Support Credit which focused
mainly on non-income poverty. In particular, PSCP II aimed to create sustainable conditions for
enterprise creation and growth that would respond to local and export markets. It focused on
interventions that were considered the key constraints to that goal: lack of access to credit;
infrastructure constraints; low levels of labor and management skills; and other investment
climate constraints including insecure property rights.

69.     The approach continues to remain relevant to Uganda’s development priorities, as
confirmed by the current Country Assistance Strategy of 2010-2015 which emphasizes improved
conditions for private sector growth and increased productivity and commercialization of
agriculture. Similarly, the PSCP II objectives are consistent with current World Bank Africa
Strategy to enhance competitiveness and employment. The PSCP II objectives also resonate in
the new Competitiveness and Enterprise Development Project, which continues the focus on land
reform and improving the business environment.

70.     The design of PSCP II was underpinned by a considerable amount of analysis conducted
by the Bank, such as the Africa Trade Standards Report (2003) that identified the need for
establishing and complying with agreed standards to successfully enter EU and US markets, a
FIAS study on administrative barriers to investment (2003), the Report on Export
Competitiveness, and the Investment Climate Assessment (2004). It also built upon best


                                               18 
 
 


practices related to industrial parks and export processing zones and land reform, as well as the
successful experience of PSCP I.

71.     Generally PSCP II’s components and implementation arrangements were aligned with the
project’s objectives. The exception to this was the enhanced design of KIBP following a study
tour to East Asia. The change may not have been practical and was not financially feasible given
the project scope. Another relevancy issue was the design of the financial sector deepening
program, which did not adequately consider the eligibility criteria that restricted public or quasi-
public agencies from benefitting from the program.

72.    Furthermore, the ambitiousness and range of components made implementation complex,
which was a major factor in the project’s performance. As noted, UIA did not have the requisite
technical skills to oversee major civil works, especially related to environmental issues. More
broadly, weak oversight by PFSU and the Project Steering Committee was only addressed when
much damage had already been done (e.g., fraud and corruption in the procurement process).

3.2    Achievement of Project Development Objectives
Rating: Modest

73.     As noted in the Development Credit Agreement, “The objective of the Project is to
support the Borrower's efforts for creation of sustainable conditions conducive to enterprise
development and growth, encouraging investment, facilitating private sector development,
increasing micro, small and medium enterprises, increasing competitiveness in local and export
market, and employment opportunities in its territory, through: (a) reduction of the cost of doing
business; and (b) improvement of business environment and public-private dialogue.?

74.     In evaluating whether the intended outcome was achieved, several aspects are assessed.
Strictly considering the indicators, the table below shows that of the 13 PDO indicators, 7 PDO
indicators can be considered achieved (partially or totally). Of these 7, however, 3 are poor
indicators because it is difficult to attribute the results to the project. For the other 4 PDO
indicators the results reveal that that there were significant strides in lowering business costs as
reflected by the tremendous improvement in the number of days to register a business, number of
formally registered new enterprises, and number of days to access land records. These significant
improvements can be largely attributed to the project. And, while the number of new jobs created
in the formal sector was not accurately tracked, there is evidence that the target was actually
achieved. Of the 23 intermediate indicators, 3 were not achieved and an additional 2 were also
considered not achieved because there no end-project result was indicated. Overall, of the 36
PDO and intermediate indicators, 25 can be considered totally or partially achieved.

75.     Nevertheless, overall project performance is considered somewhat disappointing due to
the failure of sub-component 1.1, the KIBP, which represented about one-third of total project
financing, of which about 40 percent of the allocated amount had been disbursed or committed
by the time of the January 2012 restructuring when the sub-component was cancelled. By that
time the project had supported the development of the Master Plan and the base for the KIBP
road network. By project end, KIBP had five tenants employing about 500 people. The
construction of the industrial park was expected to create access to modern industrial facilities
with reliable infrastructure. Even the few investors who ventured to invest, the time taken to
establish the industries was very long with high costs. Moreover, the export processing zone
envisaged during project design was never realized; this was partly attributed to the
Parliamentary delay in passing the related law. Unfortunately, partial implementation of works
under KIBP poses reputational risks including unresolved environmental and social issues. The
incompleteness of the KIBP represents a missed opportunity for Uganda, especially since
potential investors are likely to look elsewhere.

76.    But it would be a mistake to judge the performance of PSCP II based solely on the
disappointing outcome the KIBP sub-component. Despite problems, the PSCP II had notable
outcomes that encouraged investment and facilitated private sector development.

77.    From an overall perspective Uganda’s relative ranking in the Global Competitiveness
Index actually declined over the project period (from 13th among its African peer countries in
2003-2004 to 24th in 2012-2013). This decline, however, is primarily due to other African
countries significantly improving their competitiveness indicators relative to Uganda’s
competitiveness, which reflects numerous factors (e.g., infrastructure, skills) not just the business
environment. In fact, sustained improvement in Uganda’s business environment is borne out by

the Doing Business indicator “distance to frontier?. Figure 1 shows that overtime Uganda
actually improved its performance over the 2006 to 2013 period.

        Note: This measure shows the distance of each economy to the “frontier,? which represents the highest
        performance observed on each of the indicators across all economies. An economy’s distance to frontier is
        indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 the frontier. For
        example, a score of 48 in 2006 means the Uganda economy was 52 percentage points away from the frontier
        constructed from the best performances across all economies. A higher score of 55 in 2013 would indicate
        that the economy is improving and its distance to frontier is now only 45 percentage points from the frontier.

78.     In respect to creating sustainable conditions for enterprise development and growth, the
activities supported by Component 2 (Enhancing Enterprise Expansion) had many good results,
including the following highlights:
        Matching grants (under BUDS) to over 800 MSMEs provided a wide range of support,
         from business plan development to staff training to financial management systems to
         international marketing and sales promotion. The scheme also reached its goal of
         disbursing at least one-third of the grants to sub-regions outside Kampala. Based on ex
         post assessment, 92 percent of the companies surveyed indicated that their business
         competitiveness had increased as a result. Based on the survey group, the average sales
         volume and average profits each more than doubled in the year after the BUDS
         intervention. For the companies sampled (10 percent of the BUDS recipients) 1,300 jobs
         were created which implies that a significant amount of jobs were likely to have been
         created for the entire group. Of the total 7,500 individual beneficiaries nearly 40 percent
         were women.
        Six MSMEs benefitted from the Technology Acquisition Fund and were able to improve
         their technology adaption and usage, such as fruit drying technologies for export,
         pasteurization, and packaging for the dairy sector. Together, this resulted in four-fold
         increase in the number of products produced by these firms. In terms of new markets
         created due to this support, 80 percent were international markets. In addition, about 60
         jobs were created as a direct result.


                                                           21 
 
 


             The Enterprise Skills Linkage Program benefitted over 63 enterprises, encompassing over
              five thousand people, supporting training in apprenticeship, skills up-grading, internship,
              and enterprise-to-enterprise training. Women represented over 40 percent of the business
              owners receiving training, and were largely concentrated in tailoring, catering, and hair
              salons. The skills program was innovative in that it combined on-site technical training
              with development of business skills such as book-keeping and marketing.6 Many
              beneficiaries cited this aspect of the training as especially useful.
             The Business Plan Competition attracted over 10,000 applicants of whom 500 budding
              entrepreneurs received initial training and mentorship to formalize their business. Of
              these, 27 were winners and received seed money and started their businesses. This
              particular initiative resulted in the creation of about 300 jobs. For the winners, the
              average volume of sales increased substantially following the intervention and average
              profits doubled. Of the winning firms, 18 percent of the beneficiary companies were
              owned by women and 23 percent were jointly owned by women and men.
             Under the Business Brand Linkages Program, at least eight brands were developed and
              have been able to penetrate international markets. Support was also extended to two
              exporting associations. This intervention resulted in an estimated 600 jobs created. As an
              example of results, one recipient company interviewed during the ICR mission (Star
              Café) is now exporting one container a month of newly-branded coffee to China.

79.     The project sought to increase employment opportunities and micro, small and medium
enterprises. As discussed, the project indicators were either inappropriate because the outcomes
cannot necessarily be linked to project activities or there were no target values or final end-
project data available. But based on the sample surveyed for the impact assessment of
Component 2, noted above, there is a strong indication that the number of jobs created by the
project exceeded 10,000.

80.      In addition to these activities, the project also improved the financial services to MSMEs
and introduced several financial innovations under Component 1.2. A noteworthy outcome was
the establishment and operationalization of the Credit Reference Bureau. While this creates a
strong foundation for facilitating access to credit – and credit extended to the private sector as a
percentage of GDP more than doubled during the project period – the existence of the new Credit
Reference Bureau by itself did not necessarily lead to increased credit. The increase may have
been attributable to more fundamental macroeconomic conditions and evolving sector policies. A
direct link would have to be substantiated by whether lenders used the data provided and whether
the quality of that data was accurate.

81.    Uganda significantly improved its Doing Business ranking for getting credit; Uganda was
ranked 48th in 2012 (out of 183 countries) compared to 109th in 2009, and also compared
favorably with the regional average ranking for Sub-Saharan African countries of 110th . PSCP II

     A Development Impact Evaluation was conducted on the skills training program. The preliminary results reveal some short-
     term positive effects of the training on financial literacy and technical knowledge, optimism, and adherence to standards and
     procedures. However, the impact evaluation finds no effects after 12 months on core business outcomes. These include
     innovation (number of new products or new designs), business development (investment, access to finance), and business
     performance (revenues and profits). More broadly, this is important feedback to development practitioners as they consider
     the utility and impact of specific interventions, based on rigorous analysis.



                                                                22 
 
 


support to the Financial Market Development Plan implemented by the Bank of Uganda,
increased capacity, developed new products in leasing and mortgage finance, and improved
financial literacy and consumer protection. Facilitation of trade insurance was achieved through
Uganda’s participation in the African Trade Insurance Facility. PSCP II also financed the
establishment of the Securities Central Depository (SCD) which led to the increase in the number
of trading days on the stock exchange from three to five. During the period, both the listings and
volumes traded also increased.

82.     There were also important achievements and impact related to reducing the cost of doing
business and improving the business environment. The most successful business environment
improvement was related to the project’s support to modernize land administration and
management (sub-component 3.1). The project supported the design, installation, and
operationalization of a national land information system. This also involved: the construction and
renovation of 13 district land offices and national land information centers; inventory of
government land in five districts; scanning of all leasehold and freeholds, majority of maps and
part of mailo land records; and the elimination of backlog of unprocessed land registrations.
Another achievement was the revival and rehabilitation of the school of surveying and land
management. These activities led to tremendous impact as reflected by: a reduction in the
number of days to access land records from over 435 days to being instantaneous; a reduction in
the time to register a property from 225 days to 52 days (2013); and over 3,500 additional titles
being issued annually.7 In addition, efficiency in processing mortgages improved to the extent
that the days required to do so were reduced from more than 2 weeks to 3 days. The impact on
improving the business climate has been considerable but is most significant for businesses
dealing with land in urban areas, where more land is registered, compared to only 5 percent in
rural areas.

83.     PSCP II also supported considerable land-related policy and legislative work, such as the
National Land Policy, approved by the Cabinet in February 2013; the National Land Use Policy,
adopted in 2007 and followed by enactment of the Physical Planning Act 2010; the Mortgage
Act 2009; and the Land (Amendment) Act 2010 to reduce illegal evictions. In addition, the
project supported the piloting of: systematic titling of high-value rural land using best practice,
low-cost, and transparent approaches; average registration costs were reduced from more than
US$200 to about US$23 per land parcel (compared to US$25 in Thailand, which is known as
best practice). The follow-on project will build on these achievements and scale-up activities to
improve land services. This has the potential to be truly transformational for Uganda’s economy.
Sound land policies are known to be a catalyst for commercialization of agriculture and are
essential for facilitating flows of private investment into industries, creating new jobs, and
stimulating mobility and structural change, as well as ensuring well-functioning cities and
sustainable resource use.

84.    Successes were also achieved in the area of business registration regime in Uganda (sub-
component 3.2). Despite not starting up until the final year of implementation, operational and
governance reforms were undertaken at the Uganda Registration Services Bureau to improve
services and reduce corruption. In addition, the project financed computers and equipment to
support data entry. The impact was rapid and substantial: the time taken to register a business

    ICR interviews with sector specialists revealed that the original baselines were likely to be inaccurate and overstated. Hence,
    while these outcomes are nevertheless impressive, the magnitude of change is not as great as it may appear.

                                                                 23 
 
 


declined from 135 days to just 2 days. In addition, the number of enterprises registering new
formal businesses exceeded 22,000 in 2012, well over its end-project target. And the ease of
starting a business in terms of percentage of income per capita (Doing Business indicator)
dropped significantly from 123 percent in 2004 to 77 percent in 2013. An improved business
registration process that is simple, secure, transparent can stimulate formalization of MSMEs and
job creation, as well as increase access to financial/ technical services. More broadly, this will
support poverty reduction, employment creation, and expand the tax base. The new
Competitiveness and Enterprise Development Project will continue to support further
streamlining of the business registration process through the establishment of a one-stop-shop for
business registration.

85.     PSCP II also supported improvements in the legal framework for business, financial
services, exports, and intellectual property. Specifically, the project supported the review of 18
(of 21 targeted) key business legislations. But the operationalization of these laws has been
seriously delayed (only 5 were operationalized by project-end).

86.     Another project objective was to increase competitiveness in local and export markets.
The project sought to encourage Ugandan firms and farmers to invest in systems and product
certification that would be acceptable to export markets was supported. The development of a
strategic plan for this was prepared and included an interim platform for implementation of
“Global Gap? (an agricultural certification program especially for European markets) (sub-
component 3.3). Unfortunately, because of the significant delay in starting this work, related
training and certification process was not achieved and thus limited the impact.

87.    While it may not be possible to attribute export trends to the project (given the nature of
such an indicator) it is still noteworthy that non-coffee exports increased relative to traditional
coffee exports over the project period (See Figure 2). And, in terms of achieving the
Government’s objective of average annual growth of exports of 10 percent, as articulated in its
Poverty Eradication Action Plan, the average annual growth rate during the 2005-2012 period
was actually 20 percent. Nonetheless, specific non-traditional exports that were highlighted
during project design such as vanilla, maize, and fruits/vegetables increased in volume terms
during the 2005-2006 period, but then declined or vacillated; flowers experienced no real growth
in volume terms over the entire project period (See Figure 3).

88.     PSCP II financed several activities to enhance public-private sector dialogue and
partnerships (sub-component 3.5). As a result, PSFU and other business associations
strengthened their capacity to participate in policy dialogue with government including preparing
advocacy and trade policy papers and briefs. In addition, the semi-annual Presidential Investors
Round Table meetings provided important opportunities to engage with the Government at the
highest levels. Hence the explicit project goal to strengthen the private sector capacity for
effective policy advocacy can be considered achieved. For its part, the Government articulated
its own Medium-Term Competitiveness Strategy including analyzing ways to improve the cost
effectiveness of public service delivery organizations (done through the Competitiveness
Investment Climate Strategy Secretariat which was set up through PSCP II). The transformation
of the privatization unit within the Ministry of Finance and the preparation of PPP legislative and
regulatory framework were only partially achieved, however.

3.3    Efficiency
Rating: Modest

89.     Annex 3 discusses the original analysis done at design stage in comparison with actual
results demonstrated by the project. The analysis prepared at appraisal estimated an internal rate
of return (IRR) of 43 percent for the overall project, along with valuation estimates for several of
the major sub-components. The methodology used for the design stage analysis, however,
exhibits numerous methodological concerns and an incomplete sensitivity analysis. Ex post
valuations of project activities are extremely difficult to calculate due to the nature of activities,
difficulties in attribution of specific activities, and the extent of the data gathered. As such, an ex
post valuation was only possible for the activities under Component 2. The ex post valuations for
the matching grant activities (sub-components 2.1 and 2.2) and branding support activities (sub-
component 2.3) indicate positive valuations for these activities. The actual net present value
(NPV) for the matching grant activities (sub-components 2.1 and 2.2) was lower than the
estimated value, while the NPV valuation for branding support activities (sub-component 2.3)
was considerably higher than the design estimate. These positive valuations indicate good value
for money for activities under these sub-components.

90.    The second restructuring in January 2012 cancelled US$21.5 million (related to sub-
component 1.1) and allowed for a reallocation amongst the components (specifically to the land
sub-component). This reallocation reflected, in part, higher costs for the district land offices
which had increased during the lengthy implementation delays. When the project closed in
February 2013, the project had disbursed US$50.7 million of US$70 million or approximately 72
percent of the original IDA credit amount. After the January 2012 cancellation the final project
amount was reduced to US$49.63 million; accordingly the final disbursement percentage was
102 percent (exchange fluctuations account for exceeding 100 percent).

91.   At the time of the January 2012 restructuring, US$9.6 million had been spent on sub-
component 1.1, financing the earthworks (usable dirt roads) and other UIA “soft? improvements.

                                                  25 
 
 


But since the construction (reflecting changed scope and location) of the UIA-KIBP office block,
resident engineer’s office, and a laboratory had not received the Bank’s no objection, no
corresponding disbursements were made for these structures. The roads and structures are of
questionable use until plans and financing to complete the park are resolved. Moreover, the
‘value for money audit’ not only indicated that the building cost was three-and-a-half times the
original estimate, but also noted that compared to similar projects in the region, the per square
meter cost was about 40 percent more. Notwithstanding the significant design change, it did not
help that such a lengthy period had passed since the initial project costs had been estimated
during project design, during which time prices increased for all activities and thus affected
efficiency.

92.     The project design sought to effectively leverage development partner resources,
specifically related to the financial services to MSMEs under sub-component 1.2. However, by
2008 the development partners had cut their support for MSME credit programs. Accordingly, at
the time of the first restructuring in February 2009, US$1 million was reallocated within PSCP II
to the Financial Sector Deepening Program, sub-component 1.2.

93.     The cost effectiveness of the PSFU is judged to be adequate. The estimated operating
costs for the PSFU was US$3.47 million at the time of project design, and was subsequently
increased (at each of the two restructurings) to approximate total of US$6.0 million, which was
slightly overspent by project close. To a great extent, this was due to the fact that the project was
extended from five to eight years.

94.     Bank administrative costs for supervision (not including ICR preparation) over the eight
year implementation period averaged about US$127,000 per year. This is high compared to the
Africa regional annual average allocation to projects of US$112,000 during the same period. In
2008 and 2009 the actual administrative costs were one-and-half to two times the regional
average. This was accounted for by the extra time required to get the land-related sub-component
fully operational, given its late start.

95.     Notwithstanding these observations, the achievements obtained from Components 2 and
3, and the generally reasonable Bank and Borrower operational costs, efficiency for this project
is nonetheless rated modest. This is due to the serious value for money issues surrounding the
outcome of sub-component 1.1 prior to its cancellation.

3.4           Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

96.     The overall rating of the outcome of this project is moderately unsatisfactory.8 This rating
takes into account the substantial relevance of the project at the time of design as well as at
completion, and the modest achievement of project development objectives, and the modest
efficiency in use of resources. It is unfortunate that the problem related to the KIBP sub-

    Normally, given the change in the indicators as a result of the second restructuring, a split evaluation of the project’s
    performance would be conducted. This would essentially weigh (by share of disbursements) the performance both before and
    after the revision. However, since this change took place when all but one component had closed and the PDO outcome is
    judged to be moderately unsatisfactory both before and after, no such evaluation has been prepared for this ICR.



                                                               26 
 
 


component had not been dealt with in a timely manner; otherwise, the project would have
merited an overall outcome in the satisfactory range.

3.5    Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspect, and Social Development

97.     There was no mechanism in place to measure the project’s impact on poverty.
Nonetheless, the creation of jobs from the various interventions under Component 2 is likely to
have a positive impact on poverty reduction for the beneficiaries. In terms of the gender aspect,
no specific goals were articulated but the ex post assessment does show that women were able to
benefit significantly from many interventions, including 40 percent of the beneficiaries of the
matching grants scheme. Although KIBP was not fully completed, the adjacent communities did
gain from new water connections, sanitation, and a community soccer field.

(b) Institutional Change / Strengthening

98.    The project strengthened several implementing and beneficiary agencies. This is most
noteworthy in the case of land-related interventions. The Ministry of Lands is now equipped to
manage a land information system as well as manage the new scaled-up project. PSCP II also
supported the revival and rehabilitation of the school of surveying and land management.

99.    In addition, the project financed part of the Bank of Uganda’s Financial Markets
Development Plan which led to important institutional improvements such as linking of the Real
Time Gross Settlement systems (under auspices of the Bank of Uganda) to the Securities Central
Depository (overseen by the Uganda Securities Exchange). The project supported change
management, institutional modernization, and improvement of service provision in the Uganda
Registration Services Bureau. The other beneficiary agencies and units – Uganda Law Reform
Commission, Uganda National Bureau of Standards, and Competitiveness Investment Climate
Strategy Secretariat – were also strengthened through project activities.

100. Finally, PSCP II led to improvements in the capacity of both UIA and PSFU. UIA
restructured its management, strengthened internal controls, and increased governance oversight;
improvements responding, in large part, to problems raised by the ‘value for money’ audit.
Similar management improvements were made at PSFU. PSFU increased its membership
significantly over the project period (from 71 in 2005 to 175 by 2013) and became recognized as
an effective proponent for the private sector. And, the explicit project goal to strengthen the
private sector capacity for effective policy advocacy can be considered achieved. Finally, an
incidental but important outcome of the Enterprise Skills and Linkages Program was the forging
of strong collaboration between the public and private sectors in terms of skills development --
the private sector is actively engaged in the Government’s new “Skilling Uganda? initiative.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts

101. There is evidence from other countries that show with the applied techniques related to
land registration – specifically digitization of land records – corruption goes down. Therefore,
given that this was done well under the PSCP II, it is anticipated that this will lead to greater


                                               27 
 
 


transparency and a reduction in corruption related to land registration. This is also likely to apply
to the business registry.

102. Another unintended outcome was a spin-off study of the Development Impact Evaluation
(noted in footnote 6). The study found that women working in male-dominated sectors, like
metal fabrication and foundry, earn nearly double those working in traditional industries and also
work fewer hours per week. At the same time, large informational gaps exist among women
operating in traditional industries about the returns available in male-dominated sectors. The
impact study conducted an analysis on the mechanisms to become a crossover to a male-
dominated industry and advocated that informational campaigns combined with mentorship
interventions can facilitate the growth of female entrepreneurship in non-traditional industries.

4.     Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

103. The risk that development outcomes from this project will not be maintained is moderate.
The primary risk is associated with the partial completion of the KIBP, which poses a serious
danger of it becoming a ‘white elephant’. The basic infrastructure that was put in place will soon
begin to deteriorate unless the earthworks are built up with roads and the buildings are occupied
and maintained. Moreover, the lack of fully supportive infrastructure makes it difficult to attract
more occupants (as of project close there were only five). Going forward, the Master Plan will
also need to be reconsidered especially related to defining wet and dry lands areas. Although
there is strong Government commitment to identify financing to complete the industrial park,
there is concern about negative perceptions given that the Bank’s financing of this component
was cancelled.

104. There is also a risk to ensuring that improvements in the business environment are
maintained. Specifically, this concerns the operationalization of only five of the new 18 laws that
were supported by the project. However, this risk is considered moderate since the legal
framework is now well established and the operationalization of the laws is more a timing issue
than anything else. (The new Competitiveness and Enterprise Development Project will also
support their operationalization.) And, notwithstanding that the training received by MSMEs will
continue to be put to good use, the training program under Component 2 is unlikely to be
continued. Fortunately, however, the Government’s new “Skilling Uganda? initiative will be
rolled out.

105. Despite these risks, most project achievements are likely to be sustained. Related to the
KIBP under sub-component 1.1 for instance: the water points and improved sanitation provided
to the communities adjacent to the KIBP site will continue to have a strong impact; UIA’s
streamlined investment processes will likely continue; and UIA’s investment promotion
activities have gained traction and will likely to remain strong, especially reaching the Uganda
diaspora abroad.

106. A significant result from the project that will probably endure is the critical change in
attitude of key public service agencies and their staff who are now performing new roles, moving
from gatekeeper to service provider or facilitator. This is especially evident in the improvement
in service standards related to land and business registration. Also, the new system of land

                                                 28 
 
 


management that was supported by PSCP II has created a solid basis for the development of a
land market. These outcomes will be reinforced by activities financed by the new
Competitiveness and Enterprise Development Project.

5.     Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1    Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality of Entry
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

107. The design was substantially relevant when the project was prepared and remains so
today. Moreover, there was logic to how the components fit together which laid a strong
foundation for the follow-on project. Nonetheless, quality of entry is judged moderately
unsatisfactory for several reasons. First, the project design was complex, seeking to cover many
areas when implementation readiness was weak. In particular, project preparation did not
sufficiently assess the technical capacity of the implementing agency to handle civil works. If the
institutional capacity had been better at the outset – for all components -- it is likely that the
project wouldn’t have experienced the significant delays or other problems. In respect to delays,
the Bank may not have sufficiently taken into account the political reality of obtaining
Parliamentary approval during a period prior to national elections.

108. Second, although the PAD identified corruption and internal audit weaknesses as risks,
albeit modest, the risk mitigation measures were clearly inadequate. It is apparent that the Bank
did not fully appreciate the implementing agencies’ weak governance structures. Third, even
though it was not unusual in that era, the project design did not include a suitable results
framework. Fourth, while the stakeholder agencies may have been consulted, because their role
was generally designed to be narrow this resulted in lack of ownership in several cases. This was
complicated by the arrangement to have a private sector organization manage the project-related
activities of public sector agencies. Finally, if the project had received a Category A rating for
environmental impact, these issues would no doubt have been subject to greater scrutiny,
possibly averting the environment-related problems that contributed to the cancellation of sub-
component 1.1.

(b) Quality of Bank Supervision
Rating: Unsatisfactory

109. In evaluating the Bank’s performance during supervision there are many factors to
consider. The quality of design certainly had profound implications on the quality of
implementation and, in turn, the Bank team’s ability to effectively address them. The multi-
sector nature of the project was certainly a challenge. Over the past decade the Bank has
acquired lessons on how to better supervise this type of multi-sector project, and the experience
with PSCP II will no doubt contribute to that knowledge. More fundamentally, however, if PSFU
and UIA had had strong governance and management systems from the outset, many of the
problems may not have emerged, or at the least would have been effectively addressed earlier.



                                                29 
 
 


110. Nonetheless, the Bank holds responsibility for not being sufficiently proactive on several
fronts. This is especially apparent with respect to: the lack of regular on-site supervision of the
UIA office block site until after much of the work had been completed. In part, this reflects the
fact that the Task Team Leader was not based in-country during that period which would have
allowed day-to-day contact with the counterpart, and also perhaps because of an inappropriate
(technical) composition of the supervision team which did not actively engage a civil engineer
until problems emerged. Other criticisms of the Bank’s performance are: its ambiguity related to
UIA’s change in scope of KIBP and the related long delay in considering the no-objection for the
major works contracts in sub-component 1.1; the failure to effectively address the fact that the
Project Steering Committee was not performing its role; the poor reporting and serious lack of
candor in implementation reports; and the persistently deficient results framework despite being
highlighted by the QALP Review and noted in management reviews. The Bank team should be
commended, however, for proactively raising concerns to INT about fraud and corruption and
requesting that the Government conduct the ‘value-for-money’ audit of the KIBP building
structures. Similarly, the acceleration of project implementation during the final two years can be
partly attributed to the Bank team’s concerted efforts.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Unsatisfactory

111. Over the eight year implementation period the project was supervised by three different
Task Team Leaders, two of which were based in a neighboring country, and the final Task Team
Leader was based in Uganda. The turn-over of the Task Team Leaders and their location outside
of the country for much of the project period no doubt contributed to weak supervision. Based on
the interviews conducted for this ICR, assessments of the Bank team were mixed. INT did praise
the third Task Team Leader and current procurement specialist for being highly competent and
alerting INT of potential fraud and corruption. The client also expressed strong appreciation for
the support provided by the Bank’s land expert.

112. Unfortunately, however, collectively the Bank performed unsatisfactorily. This critique is
also addressed to the Bank’s country and sector management which did not take advantage of
opportunities to ensure that the project design was sufficiently robust, that supervision teams
were appropriately staffed, and that corrective and timely actions were taken during
implementation. Failure to be proactive was most acute when potentially course-correcting
actions were not taken during two restructuring opportunities. Indeed, if the Bank had been more
proactive and timely in addressing administrative mismanagement related to KIBP, the project
outcome rating would have likely been in the satisfactory range.

5.2    Borrower Performance

(a)    Government Performance
Rating: Unsatisfactory

113. Over the project period, senior Government leadership repeatedly voiced its strong
commitment to the project. This was reflected in fully allocating its committed counterpart
funds. Notwithstanding this affirmation, the Government’s performance is rated as
unsatisfactory. This rating is primarily attributed to the fact that for most of the project period the

                                                  30 
 
 


Project Steering Committee did not adequately perform its oversight function. Project
performance was also negatively affected by the change in land pricing policy that jeopardized
the financial viability of the industrial park. In addition, the long delay of Parliamentary approval
of the project impeded a strong start. And the lengthy process to review and operationalize new
laws makes tenuous any achievements in the legal framework for business and financial services.
Many of these problems were eventually addressed, including more intensive Project Steering
Committee oversight during the final two years of implementation. Unfortunately, however, the
corrective measures were not sufficient to reverse the negative impact these problems had on
project outcome.

(b)       Implementing Agencies (PSFU and UIA)
Rating: Unsatisfactory

114. The rating of the implementing agency is considered unsatisfactory. Regrettably, the
weak capacity of PSFU and UIA at the start of the project was the underlying reason that
allowed many serious problems to emerge. Most notably, this related to the inadequate
management by UIA of the construction of the KIBP / UIA office block, as well as the lack of
appropriate PSFU oversight of procurement which resulted in fraud and corruption in the bidding
process. It is commendable that strong remedial measures were put in place by both PSFU and
UIA, which led to improved project performance from 2011 onwards. But coming so late in the
project period, this didn’t allow enough time to fully achieve the project’s objectives. While the
role of the beneficiary agencies was more limited in terms of implementation, they generally
performed satisfactorily.
 
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Unsatisfactory

115. Based on an unsatisfactory rating for the performance of the Government and an
unsatisfactory rating for the performance of the implementing agencies, the overall rating for
Borrower performance is unsatisfactory.

6.        Lessons Learned

116.      Key lessons for the Bank are:
         The desire to realize efficiencies and comprehensiveness with a larger project should not
          over-ride the risks inherent in a complex project design. Moreover, the implementing
          agencies’ institutional preparedness and strong governance framework should be
          considered paramount, especially the capacity to handle complex civil works.
         The importance of getting the monitoring and evaluation framework right, from the
          beginning, cannot be overstated. This proved to be the ‘Achilles heel’ of PSCP II.
         Proactivity is critical. When fiduciary problems do emerge, Bank management and INT
          need to be consulted promptly to ensure timely and decisive actions (as was the case in
          this project). Similarly, if the Bank had been more timely in addressing the KIBP
          problem, the project outcome would have been better. Moreover, many project



                                                 31 
 
 


        stakeholders expressed their frustration with ambiguous and drawn out interactions with
        the Bank on procurement matters.
       Frequent supervision missions (beyond the norm) are necessary when problems emerge.
        In this respect, it is highly beneficial that the Task Team Leader is based in the country to
        allow for continuous engagement and informal updates that may not happen otherwise.
        Furthermore, the Bank’s own team should sufficiently involve the right technical
        expertise to identify potential problems (e.g., civil engineer to conduct on-site
        supervision).
       Monitoring documents should not only be candid, but ratings need to be consistent with
        disbursement lags. It is a clear red flag to management when large and persistent
        disbursement lags are accompanied by consistently satisfactory ratings.

117.    Key lessons that were emphasized by the implementing and beneficiary agencies are:
       Strong Borrower oversight (e.g., Project Steering Committee) of the project must be
        taken seriously from the beginning, rather than only activated once problems emerge.
       Having the private sector (PSFU) manage the delivery of the public sector agencies may
        achieve some objectives, but it can risk reducing ownership by the beneficiary agencies.
        Likewise, problems can easily emerge when one agency is responsible for procurement
        while another agency is responsible for contract management. This is aggravated in the
        absence of strong oversight by the Borrower.
       As noted above, the importance of getting the monitoring and evaluation framework
        right, from the beginning, cannot be overstated. An M&E specialist should be part of the
        Borrower’s project preparation team and continue to be actively engaged throughout
        project implementation.
       For high profile projects like industrial parks, an economically rational and financially
        viable land pricing policy needs to be applied consistently and transparently. Attracting
        investment to such endeavors may backfire without infrastructure and serviceable land in
        place. Similarly, the country risks losing out on potential investments when important
        pieces of business-related legislation are not pass or fully operationalized.

118. To a great extent, the above lessons have been reflected in the new World Bank-financed
Competitiveness and Enterprise Development Project (discussed in detail in Section 2.5).

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower

119. As this ICR was being prepared, the Borrower (specifically its implementing agency
PSFU) provided clarification and additional information and documentation which underpinned
the key findings. Several of the issues raised in this ICR also align with the Borrower’s own ICR
(Annex 5). Accordingly, no specific comments from the Borrower were provided on the final
version, although it was noted that the ICR was generally viewed to be objective, factual, and
provided important lessons.

                                 Outputs by Components
                                   Uganda PSCP II (P083809)

1.      The project development objective of PSCP II was to support the Borrower's efforts for
creation of sustainable conditions conducive to enterprise development and growth, encouraging
investment, facilitating private sector development, increasing micro, small and medium
enterprises, increasing competitiveness in local and export market, and employment
opportunities in its territory. To this end, the project financed activities included in three
components. The related outputs and outcomes are discussed in this annex.

Component 1: Developing Infrastructure and Financial Services (UIA and PSFU)

2.       The objective of this component was to provide priority infrastructure and related
facilities to support the growth of the industrial and business sector, particularly through
enhancing the availability of serviced industrial land in a modern, well-planned industrial park.
The project also aimed to improve the provision of financial services to MSMEs.

3.      There were two sub-components for Component 1. The first, related to infrastructure for
the industrial park, was managed by the Uganda Investment Agency (UIA). The second related
to financial services and was managed by the Private Sector Foundation Uganda (PSFU). Of the
two PDO indicators related to Component 1 (actually sub-component 1.2), both were partially
achieved. Of the six intermediate indicators for this component, four were achieved (of which
one partially). (See Data Sheet) Sub-component 1.1 related to KIBP was cancelled in November
2011. All other Component 1 activities were closed on January 30, 2012.

Sub-component 1.1: Providing Basic Infrastructure Services for the Private Sector (UIA)

4.       The project design envisaged the provision of infrastructure facilities in the form of
serviced land for primarily industrial and business activities at a new Industrial Park at Namanve
located 11 kilometers east of Kampala (Kampala Industrial and Business Park (KIBP)). Specific
activities were to include: (i) development of primary external or off-site infrastructure (access
roads, intersections, water and electricity supply facilities, sewerage and wastewater treatment);
(ii) capacity building of UIA in investment promotion and facilitation as well as industrial
planning; (iii) develop an environmental and social monitoring framework and system which will
serve as a model for industrial park management and operation; (iv) provision of technical
assistance to support the implementation of the new legislation, conduct regional planning,
develop social and environmental impacts mitigation plans, develop an implementation plan for
the KIBP, and assist in the rolling out of the plan; and (v) investment promotion functions and
activities of the UIA.

5.     The project did not achieve the planned outputs for this sub-component, which was
cancelled in November 2011 due to delays in implementation and procurement and
environmental concerns related to KIBP. However, several outputs and outcomes were attained
including:



                                               34 
 
 

        Finalization of the KIBP Master Plan.
        The earthworks that involved opening up of the roads network (approximately 6.18 km)
         were completed.
        Capacity of UIA was enhanced.
        Major environmental and social safeguards were addressed (although will still require
         further attention going forward).
        Investment promotion was successful.
        Five companies are located in KIBP, employing 500 people (as of project-end).

Sub-component 1.2: Financial Services to MSMEs (PSFU)

6.      This sub-component aimed to support the development of financial products suitable for
MSMEs. Specifically, the project was to provide grants to financial institutions -- regulated
financial institutions, non-bank financial service providers, and industry financial associations --
for activities intended to expand the range of products and institutions serving MSMEs and to
assist in financial institution and system development. In addition, private financial institutions
had access to performance-based matching grants to cover 50 percent of the costs for
implementing and piloting new products and services. The focus was on financial sector
infrastructure, capacity building, market information, financial literacy, product development,
financial sector regulation and supervision, trade insurance, non-bank financial services, and
financial transparency.

7.       The related activities experienced a late start largely attributed to the eligibility criteria
that restricted public or quasi-public agency from benefiting. The component was envisaged to
build and leverage on other donor funded programs by DANIDA, DFID, EU, and USAID. But
all of these complementary programs had closed by the time this sub-component was gearing up.
As a result, there was an excessive demand for financing activities through this component.

8.      While PSFU had overall responsibility for coordinating this sub-component, there was a
lack of collaboration amongst the various stakeholders in the financial sector since there is no
single regulatory financial institution. This was aggravated by fact that the design for this sub-
component had not been fully participatory. The regulated financial institutions were hesitant to
deal and relate with the private sector, specifically PSFU which was responsible for the sub-
component. It took time to build and sustain confidence with key financial institutions.
Moreover, the bigger institutions wanted financial support for establishment of rural branches in
the form of equipment and operating costs, which were not eligible for project financing.

9.       Project outputs and outcomes of this sub-component included:
        Establishment and operationalization of the Credit Reference Bureau (CRB) for Uganda,
         which marked a significant step towards the improvement of credit risk management in
         the financial sector. In particular, Uganda ranked 48th in the 2012 Doing Business
         Report, in terms of ease of getting credit against 183 countries, compared to 109th
         position in 2009. By September 2011 a total of 518 branches outlets were live on the
         Financial Card System and 515 outlets were connected to the CRB. 1,225 users were
         trained and over 630,000 clients have already been registered on the CRB.
                                                  35 
 
 

       Establishment and operationalization (including awareness campaign) of the Securities
        Central Depository (SCD) at the Uganda Securities Exchange. This supported the
        expansion of trading to five days a week from three days. Efficiency in terms of effecting
        settlements improved from t+5 to t+3. During the period there were increases in both the
        listings (by several fold) and volumes traded (nearly double over the 2010 – 2013
        period). By project close, linkage of CDS to Real Time Gross Settlement was at an
        advanced stage to allow for instant settlement. The CDS will eventually be linked
        regionally.
       Establishment of the African Trade Insurance (ATI) underwriting office in Uganda.
       Capacity building for private financial institutions involved training of staff in leasing,
        mortgage finance. In total, 2,120 people were trained.
       Support for the five-year Financial Markets Development Plan, implemented by the Bank
        of Uganda. This has contributed to further deepening of the financial sector mainly
        through increased capacity, development of new products in leasing and mortgage
        finance, review of the legal framework, and financial literacy and consumer protection.
       FINSCOPE II was prepared.

Component 2: Enhancing Enterprise Competitiveness (PSFU)
(Examples of how specific MSMEs benefitted from this sub-component are included in
attachment to this annex)

10.     This component aimed to increase enterprise creation and growth, particularly in
MSMEs, by changing enterprise behavior toward investment in skills (especially for women),
raising productivity, and improving the quality, standards, and reliability of MSME producers
participating in export value chains. This was to be achieved by scaling-up the ongoing matching
grant scheme implemented successfully under the first Private Sector Competitiveness Project
(PSCP I). In addition, new schemes were to be developed to target: (i) improving technology; (ii)
improving skills; (iii) supporting creation of innovative products and new lines of business by
providing grants through a business plan competition scheme; and (iv) improving financial
management of MSMEs to help increase their access to finance.

11.     There were five sub-components in Component 2, all of which were managed by PSFU.
Of the five PDO indicators related to this component only one was (largely) achieved; of the nine
intermediate indicators eight were achieved. (See Data Sheet) Activities under Component 2
closed on January 30, 2012.

Sub-component 2.1: Matching Grants for Productivity Enhancement, Financial Management,
and Export Growth Sector

12.    The sub-component was implemented through the auspices of PSFU’s Business Uganda
Development Schemes (BUDS), created under the PSCP I. The sub-component provided
matching grant (50 percent) to MSMEs on approved criteria for undertaking various activities as
highlighted above. Each eligible firm had opportunity to benefit up to US$100,000 depending on
the availability of the funds. The grants were demand driven and first-come-first-serve.


                                                36 
 
 


13.       Project outputs and outcomes related to this sub-component included:
         Grants extended to 839 MSMEs (excluding repeats), reaching over 7,500 beneficiaries
          including nearly 3,000 women. Overall, the number of MSMEs beneficiaries was double
          the initial target. Thirty-six percent of grants were to sub-regions outside Kampala
          (exceeding target disbursement of at least 30 percent).
         Support for 1,319 projects/activities including 480 repeat clients. The highest percentage
          of support given was for firms in the services sector (39 percent), followed by
          commercial agriculture (25 percent), manufacturing (20 percent), commerce (7 percent),
          farming cooperatives and associations (4 percent), consultancy and business support (3
          percent), and business associations (2 percent).
         Financing for a range of activities including: company diagnostic and planning (18
          percent of total), domestic marketing and sales (8 percent), feasibility and market
          research (11 percent), international marketing and sales promotion (12 percent),
          management systems (19 percent), production related (7 percent), and training (25
          percent).
         Support for 374 training related activities including workshops, seminars, conferences,
          and study tours. Assistance to 80 business development services providers to undertake
          capacity building courses.
         Of the companies supported, 92 percent reported an increase in their business
          competitiveness after receiving support. This was reflected in more than doubling of
          sales, on average, after the intervention.
         A total of 26,009 new jobs were attributed to this intervention.
         Of the new markets penetrated based on support provide, 49 percent were domestic
          markets and 26 percent regional markets (or beyond).

14.     In addition to the above activities under BUDS, the other intervention managed by PSFU
under this sub-component was the Technology Acquisition Fund, designed to improve
technology adaption and usage by MSMEs. Funds were provided to firms in the cotton,
horticulture, floriculture, and handicrafts sectors, partly to increase production. The intervention
contributed to acquisition and usage of new technology, improvement in efficiency, product
quality, and introduction of new products at specific firm level, which in turn, contributed to
increases in exports, employment, as well as to the firms’ competitiveness.

15.     Some of the new technologies that have been supported using the Fund cost-sharing
grants included:
         Fruit drying technologies for export in European markets.
         Commercial trials and production of chrysanthemums (summer flowers), a rare variety of
          flowers that is sold at premium markets to allow for market penetration and
          consolidation.
         Vanilla curing technology to meet export standards and quality expectations.


                                                   37 
 
 

         Value addition along the cotton value chain and production of absorbent cotton, a product
          used in the Uganda health sector but largely imported.
         Meat packaging equipment to enable penetration of the premium markets.
         Appropriate pasteurization and packaging technologies for the dairy sector.

Subcomponent 2.2: Enterprise Skills and Linkages (ESL) Program

16.     The overall goal of this sub-component was to increase innovation, product development,
and entrepreneurship. This was to be achieved by: (i) establishing closer linkages between
enterprises and technical, vocational education, and training institutions; (ii) upgrading the
quality of training in the traditional apprenticeship system; and (iii) greater orientation of these
systems toward trade qualification.

17.    In terms of enterprise skills, the program focused on four pillars: apprenticeship, skills
up-grading, internship, and enterprise-to-enterprise training. Under the apprenticeship pillar the
focus was to train managers /owners of MSMEs to become ‘master craftsmen’, who in turn train
apprentices. The skills of master craftsmen and apprentices were assessed and if they met
required standards they earned a “PASS? certificate.

18.     For the second pillar, skills upgrading, the group were mainly owners / managers /
supervisors in those enterprise sectors for which technology had changed considerably since the
beneficiaries had received their initial training. Skills upgrading was done in two stages: first the
trainers of training organizations were trained then the direct beneficiaries were trained. Through
the third pillar beneficiaries had the opportunity to gain practical work experience through
internships in enterprises.

19.     The fourth pillar, enterprise-to-enterprise training, proved to be more challenging since
very few large enterprises (a small base in any case) were willing to partner with small
enterprises for this training initiative. While nearly 700 employees did benefit from this training,
the difference between those of the training company and those of the learning company was
actually minimal.

20.       Project outputs and outcomes of the training activities included:
         A total of 63 enterprises received support which benefited a total of 5,343 people.
         45 trainers participated in train-the-trainer courses and subsequently these trainers trained
          2,242 owners/managers/supervisors of MSMEs.
         Trade qualification program was developed for which workers earned PASS certificates;
          of the 2,143 apprentices about 96 percent earned a PASS certificate.
         268 students gained practical work experience through internships.
         690 employees of MSMEs (in the fish farming and hotel sub-sectors) benefitted from the
          enterprise-to-enterprise training.




                                                   38 
 
 

21.      An important benefit of the Enterprise Skills and Linkages Program was strong
collaboration between public and private sectors in terms of skills development. It is noteworthy
that the Government built on this experience to design a larger skills program “Skilling Uganda?.
Based on the positive experience of PSCP II, the private sector is actively involved in this
initiative and chairs its steering committee.

22.     One important insight that emerged from these training initiatives was that while training
is useful, it may not be sufficient to start a business. Lack of vital equipment tends to be the
binding constraint. In the future, consideration should be given to incorporate some financial
support to enable beneficiaries acquire some the critical equipment. Other lessons related to
enterprise training are: need to improve the image of apprenticeship training; undertake initial
market surveys to understand what types of skills are in demand; assist the poor in financing
their apprenticeship training; improve basic education; upgrade the skills of master craftsmen;
introduce supplementary training for apprentices; and arrange for post training support. In
addition, the PASS certificate program needs to be carefully evaluated to determine the quality
of the training. Moreover, for the PASS certification program to be fully effective it will need to
be recognized by potential employers. This would require awareness-raising efforts.

23.     It is noteworthy that the preliminary results of a Bank-prepared Development Impact
Evaluation conducted on the skills training program reveal some short-term positive effects of
the training on financial literacy and technical knowledge, optimism, and adherence to standards
and procedures. However, the impact evaluation finds no effects after 12 months on core
business outcomes. These include innovation (number of new products or new designs), business
development (investment, access to finance), and business performance (revenues and profits).
More broadly, this is important feedback to development practitioners as they consider the utility
and impact of specific interventions, based on rigorous analysis.

Sub-component 2.3: Enterprise Skills and Linkages (ESL) Program

24.    This sub-component sought to catalyze a community of entrepreneurs, bankers, advisors,
investors, and educators through a Business Plan Competition (two rounds were conducted). This
offered grant prizes to winners of an open competition that would cover the costs of piloting an
innovative business idea. Small projects were targeted to attract as many participants as possible,
with a focus on young potential entrepreneurs. Technical support to prepare business plans was
provided to candidates. In addition to grants, winners received training and mentoring.

25.       Project outputs and outcomes related to this sub-component included:
         The “Start Your Business Competition? attracted over 10,000 applicants who submitted
          business ideas.
         500 budding entrepreneurs received training and mentorship to formalize their
          businesses.
         An alumni network of trainees to track progress was established.
         23 entrepreneurs received seed money totaling US$496,000 to started businesses.
         80 percent of the established businesses have survived beyond their first birthday.


                                                  39 
 
 

Subcomponent 2.4: Business Brand Linkages

26.     The overall objective of the Business Brand Linkages program was to capture additional
profits associated with branding and marketing initiatives, especially in export markets. Under
this sub-component, support was provided to firms to create branded export products that would
result in a premium in terms of sales revenues.

27.       Project outputs and outcomes related to this sub-component included:
         Support totaling US$340,000 provided to firms involved in coffee, tourism, and
          horticulture (dried fruits).
         Supported activities included: brand diagnostic research; brand development such as
          labels, logos, manuals, etc.; product rebranding and packaging redesign; procurement of
          appropriate prototype packaging design suitable for international markets; development
          of point of sale/brand promotional materials; and brand promotion websites, sales and
          marketing exhibitions in international markets, road shows, and other venues.
         Brands were developed for eight enterprises and two exporting associations, meeting the
          target of ten product brands created.

28.     Notwithstanding these accomplishments, other objectives of this sub-component proved
to be overly ambitious and were not achieved. These included: articulating a national branding
strategy for the marketing of Uganda exports; establishment of wildlife national parks brand
asset-building program; negotiation of joint marketing ventures with firms marketing “First
World? brands; public relations marketing campaigns that stimulate press coverage of the brand,
focusing on the stories and content associated with Uganda’s branding assets; and creation of
mechanisms to assign brand equity to farmers either directly or through intermediary
organizations.

Subcomponent 2.5: Better Business Behavior Award Scheme

29.    This sub-component was intended to promote “first mover? MSMEs by rewarding on-
time repayment for new investment loans, as well as compliance with tax administration and
business registration requirements and sound corporate governance that are necessary to become
a favored corporate client. In particular, the Better Business Behavior Award Scheme would
reward on-time repayment of new investment loans (accompanied by evidence of payment of
taxes and compliance with business registration requirements). A late payment would
automatically terminate a firm’s further eligibility under the program. The resulting high-
performance track record was expected to lower the risk and cost of subsequent loans to
successful firms and thereby demonstrate the potential for mutually profitable lending to
MSMEs.




                                                 40 
 
 

30.    The scheme was launched in December 2006 and was followed by several marketing
presentations made to chief executives of financial institutions. Many banks adapted the
innovation by initiating similar (non-PSCP II funded) schemes. For example, in the case of
Barclays if payments were made on time, 15 percent reduction on total payable interest due was
given to the MSME. Similarly, URA introduced initiatives geared towards educating and
supporting MSMEs to ensure tax compliance. Given that these schemes took off independent of
PSCP II, project support was reoriented to recognizing associations and companies that exhibit
good governance through the Association of the Year Award.

31.     This sub-component is considered highly satisfactory since the impact was significant
and sustainable. Banks have invested in financial literacy in order to improve knowledge and
behavior of MSME’s and to make them better clients. At the same time, banks have gained a
better understanding of the needs of MSMEs and adjusted their lending methods. An important
outcome is that lending to MSME’s has significantly increased.

Component 3: Improving Business Environment (various implementing agencies)

32.     Component 3 sought to modernize the commercial legal environment, reduce the time
and cost to register businesses, restore the integrity of the land registry, and improve the
efficiency of trade-related services leading to a more efficient value chain. Activities involved
close collaboration between PSFU, as the coordinating agency, and public sector agencies
including the Uganda National Bureau of Standards, the Uganda Registration Services Bureau,
the Ministry of Justice and Constitutional Affairs, and the Uganda Law Reform Commission. In
addition, the component sought to strengthen the public-private sector partnership and dialogue
started under PSCP I. These activities were supported by the Competitiveness and Investment
Climate Strategy (CICS) unit, a secretariat within the Ministry of Finance.

33.     There were five sub-components in Component 3, each of which had a separate
implementing agency. Of the six PDO indicators related to this component four were achieved.
Of the eight intermediate indicators six were achieved (of which one partially) and two were not
achieved. (See Data Sheet) All activities under Component 3 closed on January 30, 2012, except
for the land sub-component which closed February 28, 2013.

Sub-component 3.1: Land Registration Sector (Ministry of Lands)

34.     This sub-component aimed to increase the effectiveness of public land institutions so as
to make it easier to obtain and transfer evidence of land ownership. This would improve tenure
security, investment incentives, gender equity, and governance and facilitate the use of land titles
as collateral for credit. This sub-component encompassed three types of activities: (i)
rehabilitation of existing land records and upgrading of un-surveyed mailo titles; (ii)
establishment of a land information system (LIS) and expanding the coverage of land
information; and (iii) strengthening the capacity of public institutions.




                                                41 
 
 

35.    Other activities included piloting of systematic titling of high-value rural land in
Ntungamo, Iganga, and Mbale districts using best practice, low-cost, and transparent approaches.
As a result of this pilot, the average registration costs were reduced from more than US$200 to
about US$23 per land parcel (compared to US$25 in Thailand, which is known as best practice).
Also, the project supported the piloting of the identification and surveying of Government-
owned land with the view to improve its management. Unfortunately, mis-procurement is under
review for this contract although 1,086 land parcels were surveyed. These pilots will be scaled
up under the new World Bank-financed Competitiveness and Enterprise Development Project.

36.     PSCP II also supported considerable policy and legislative work and the piloting of
various initiatives including: the National Land Policy, approved by the Cabinet in February
2013; the National Land Use Policy, adopted in 2007 and followed by enactment of the Physical
Planning Act 2010; the Mortgage Act 2009; the Land (Amendment) Act 2010 to reduce illegal
evictions; and preparation and drafting of nine bills, including the Registration of Titles Bill, the
Land Survey Bill, the Land Surveyors Registration (Amendment) Bill, the Real Estate Agents
Bill, the Land Acquisition Bill, the Government Lands Bill, the Local Government Rating Bill,
the Condominium Property (Amendment) Bill, and the Uganda Land Information Systems Bill.
These bills are being finalized and processed for adoption; their implementation will be
supported under the new Competitiveness and Enterprise Development Project.

37.       Project outputs and outcomes of the sub-component included:
         Development of a comprehensive national LIS. A public information and awareness
          campaign for the LIS was also implemented.
         Revival and rehabilitation of the School of Surveying (renamed Institute of Surveying
          and Land Management) to train professionals for modern land administration. In
          addition, the development and approval of a new curriculum.
         Construction or renovation of: 13 district land offices including basic furniture and
          computer and surveying equipment; the center for LIS; first phase of center for records
          and archival; and a resource center at the Institute of Surveying and Land Management.
         Building a geodetic control and base mapping infrastructure to support LIS development
          in six zonal offices of the Ministry of Lands.
         Rehabilitation and basic computerization of land records in the mailo land registry in
          Kampala for records of Kampala, Wakiso, and Mukono districts.
         Scanned all leasehold and freeholds, majority of maps, and part of mailo land records.
         Training of staff to run the systems and institutions.
         Undertaking (on a pilot basis) an inventory of government land in five districts.

38.    These activities, especially the basic computerization of land records, have had the
following impacts:
         Search reduced from more than one year to being instantaneous.
         Mortgage reduced from more than one week to 3 days.
         Backlog of unprocessed land registrations eliminated.
         Property transfer reduced from over 200 days to 52 days.
                                                   42 
 
 


Sub-component 3.2: Business Registration (URSB)

39.     The objective of this subcomponent was to help the Uganda Registration Services Bureau
(URSB) improve its business registration services and lessen the regulatory burden for private
enterprises, create incentives for businesses that operate in the informal sector to graduate into
the formal sector, and reduce opportunities for harassment due to the legalization of businesses
and better legal protection and reduce corruption. Under this sub-component, implemented by
URSB, a team of specialists were expected to deliver: (i) a detailed design of the URSB
operational model, based on the new company law; (ii) statutes to govern URSB operations; (iii)
a strategic plan; (iv) internal procedures and regulations; (v) information systems requirements
(software and hardware); (vi) an operational manual; and (vii) staff training. In addition, the
project would support an information and outreach campaign in Kampala and other major cities
to inform entrepreneurs about the new simplified procedures of business registration and to
provide them with booklets, flyers, or other printed information about how and where to register
businesses, as well as a public outreach program through national and local media.

40.     This component did not start until 2011 due to URSB governance issues which led to the
appointment of a new URSB board. The appointment of the board was followed by a major
restructuring of the institution with major changes in top management. While impressive
progress was made in just one year of implementation, the significant delay meant that not all the
objectives were achieved.

41.       Project outputs and outcomes related to this sub-component included:
         Equipping and furnishing of the URSB.
         A systems administrator and ten data entry clerks recruited to support the
          computerization initiatives.
         Significant improvements in terms of time taken to register a business, from 135 days to
          just 2 days.
         URSB staff study tour to Zambia and Serbia and evaluate modern registries. This
          supported the preparation of the new Competitiveness and Enterprise Development
          Project.

Subcomponent 3.3: Uganda National Bureau of Standards (UNBS)

42.     This sub-component aimed to improve the competitiveness of Ugandan products in the
international market by achieving world class quality and standards. The overall objective was to
encourage Ugandan firms and farmers to invest in systems and product certification that are
acceptable in their export markets. Funding was provided to the Uganda National Bureau of
Standards (UNBS) to: (i) prepare a strategic plan for the development, implementation, service
provision, and enforcement of domestic and international standards; (ii) design and implement an
awareness program for exporters, civil society, and policy makers, to mainstream quality
assurance into public, community, and business development planning; (iii) implement the
Global Good Agriculture Practice (“Global GAP?); and (iv) establish the standards and quality
coordination mechanism.

                                                  43 
 
 

43.     This sub-component got a late start due to lengthy procurement delays. Accordingly, the
scope of activities was reduced. In particular, the awareness program was not undertaken, nor
was implementation of the Global GAP rolled out. And although UNBS did coordinate relevant
activities with the standardization strategy of the Quality Infrastructure and Standards Program
under the Ministry of Trade, the standards and quality coordination mechanism was not
completed. In terms of moving the agenda forward the challenge will be to find an appropriate
private sector champion. There is little initiative and capacity to obtain and sustain support for
this private sector-focused activity, outside the government framework.

44.       Project outputs and outcomes related to this sub-component included:
         Development of a national standardization strategy.
         Uganda was accepted and registered as member of the Global GAP.
         National interpretation guidelines for Global GAP were developed for the horticultural
          sub-sector and an interim platform for implementation of Global GAP was created.
         Global GAP training and certification was conducted for 74 participants, of which about
          one-third passed the examination and received certificates. Going forward, a local
          certification body will need to be identified and capacitated to carry out Global GAP
          certification.
         A benchmarking study tour for the horticulture sub-sector to Kenya was undertaken.

Subcomponent 3.4: Legal Framework for Business and Financial Services (ULRC)

45.     The objective of this sub-component was to support the Ministry of Justice and
Constitutional Affairs to accelerate the process of legal reform. The particular focus was on
improving laws relating to business, financial services, and exports and intellectual property so
as to facilitate a competitive business environment.

46.     The sub-component was implemented by the Uganda Law Reform Commission (ULRC).
While the target indicator was met -- 21 commercial laws revised -- relatively few were fully
operationalized because the accompanying regulations had not been completed. And even for
those five that became operational, the private sector is not aware of them.

47.       Project outputs and outcomes related to this sub-component included:
         Key business-related legislation was prepared, including completion of work on
          intellectual property rights and preparation of legislation on appellation, e-commerce, and
          leasing law, among others.
         21 laws were drafted or updated. Ten laws were assented to but only five are currently
          operational because the accompanying regulations have not yet been completed for the
          others.
         Workshops with policy makers and public hearings involving the business community
          were conducted.

          subscriptions.

Subcomponent 3.5: Public-Private Partnership (PSFU / CICS / UIA)

48.    This sub-component aimed to support the nascent private-public dialogue and focus the
dialogue on increasing exports. Specifically, the main activities sought to: (i) strengthen business
membership organizations (e.g., PSFU) to participate in policy dialogue with the Government in
shaping private sector policy, programs, and projects; (ii) support the Government and private
sector dialogue at different levels, including the Presidential Investors Round Table; and (iii)
coordinate the strategic development of the Medium Term Competitiveness Strategy (now
CICS), a secretariat within the Ministry of Finance.

49.   This sub-component was implemented by PSFU in close collaboration with UIA and
CICS.

50.       Project outputs and outcomes related to this sub-component included:
         Significant growth in PSFU membership over the project period (from 71 in 2005 to 175
          by 2013). The increased membership contributions strengthened PSFU’s financial
          sustainability (although related indicator target was not fully met) and PSFU also became
          recognized as an effective proponent for the private sector.
         UIA significantly strengthened its capacity for investment promotion, with the assistance
          of a technical advisor.
         Greater number and range of member services, including such activities as PSFU
          mentorship of associations, outreach visits to rural districts, awareness campaign of
          PSFU, formal recognition events of members.
         Numerous policy papers, briefs, and updates prepared which represented the membership
          and advocated positions on topics ranging from pensions reform, agricultural financing,
          national export strategy, non-tariff barriers, to tourism sector development.
         Public private partnership approach was taken to implement the Financial Markets
          Development Plan (spearheaded by the Bank of Uganda).
         Support to CICS in analyzing ways to improve the cost-effectiveness of public service
          delivery organizations, especially through innovative public-private partnerships.
         Presidential Investors Round Table meetings held semi-annually (a total of 12) and
          follow-up public-private technical working groups have continued the dialogue.

                                  Some Success Stories

Enterprise Skills and Linkages Program

The Katwe Small Scale Industries
Development Association (KASSIDA)
is    a    community-based     umbrella
organization for local artisans who
provide a range of fabricated products
for local regional markets. PSCP II
supported a non-formal skills training
for over 1,200 members at
their work places. The aim of training
was to impart modern skills and
knowledge for quality production, test
and certify the KASSIDA members with
competency based qualification -
workers’      PASS.    Skills   training
encompassed:
     Metal fabrication, producing
        classroom desks with metallic drawers.
     Shoe making, for which shoes were sold at an exhibition.
     Electrical and machining which led to the production of more efficient welding machines.
     Tailoring which produced school sweaters, quality suits, and ladies wear.
     Catering which used bio fuels (from banana leaves and stem products) to produce cakes.

Business Brand Linkages

Star Café Limited, a coffee processing and roasting company, benefitted from PSCP II financing
to: undertake brand audits; redesign packaging; develop point of sale concepts for line brand
promotion and advertising; and redesign the company website. As a result Star Café:
                                                       Develop six unique Star Café brands
                                                with 18 sub-brands that feature Uganda’s
                                                Arabica coffee from the Bugisu region; these
                                                products have been able to effectively compete
                                                in both domestic and international markets.
                                                       Penetrate markets in Kenya and conduct
                                                trials in Egypt, Seychelles, China, Eastern
                                                Africa and consolidating the classified UN
                                                market.
                                                       Increase sales from UGS 850 million in
                                                2008 to UGS 5.5 billion in 2012, attributed to
                                                brand development and marketing.

Technology Acquisition Fund (TAF)
                                                Mutuma Commercial Agencies is a private
                                                company that is involved in ginning and exports
                                                of cotton lint; it also manufactures soap and
                                                cooking oil from the cotton seeds. A TAF grant
                                                helped the company procure absorbent cotton
                                                technology from China in order to produce
                                                absorbent cotton for Uganda’s medical sector, for
                                                which most was initially imported. The total cost
                                                of the equipment was US$240,800 and PSCP II
                                                provided a reimbursement grant of US$100,000;
                                                the Uganda Development Bank pre-financed the
                                                activity. This led to a new factory with the
                                                following results:
       The company acquired two large orders from the leading supply chain agencies.
       The plant increased its production capacity to 300 tons per month.
       Net profit margins of about 27 percent are expected, of which 10 percentage points is
        passed back to farmers (about 3,400) in form of price increases.
       Purchase of cotton from farmers increased from about 5,000 bales per season to 6,500.
       45 jobs were created.
       The company is planning to expand production capacity.

Business Plan Competition

Epitome Kindergarden was one of 17 new
businesses to receive a grant for start-up costs
covering school building renovations, furniture,
computers, educational materials, and salaries.
While the start-up money was critical, the training
that was provided to develop the business plan and
run a successful business was considered by
Epitome’s (female) owner as extremely
worthwhile by itself. The small business was
started in 2011 and is well on schedule to become
profitable.

                             Economic and Financial Analysis
                                     Uganda PSCP II (P083809)

1.     This annex discusses the original economic and financial analysis done at design stage in
comparison with actual results demonstrated by the project. The analysis prepared at appraisal
estimated an internal rate of return of 43 percent for the overall project, along with valuation
estimates for several of the major sub-components. The methodology used for the design stage
analysis exhibits numerous methodological concerns and an incomplete sensitivity analysis.

2.      Ex post valuations of project activities are extremely difficult to calculate due to the
nature of activities, difficulties in attribution of specific activities, and the extent of the data
gathered. As such, an ex post valuation was only possible for the activities under Component 2.
The ex post valuations for the matching grant activities (sub-components 2.1 and 2.2) and
branding support activities (sub-component 2.3) indicate positive valuations for these activities.
The actual valuation for the matching grant activities (sub-components 2.1 and 2.2) was lower
than the estimated value, while the valuation for branding support activities (sub-component 2.3)
was considerably higher than the design estimate. These positive valuations indicate good value
for money for activities under these sub-components.

Component 1: Developing Infrastructure and Financial Services

Sub-component 1.1: Providing Basic Infrastructure Services to the Private Sector

3.      As part of the project design an economic and financial analysis assessed the economic
and financial return of the KIBP, to be supported under sub-component 1.1, which yielded the
following result: a net present value (NPV) of US$28.2 million (using a discount rate of 20
percent) and an internal rate of return (IRR) of 34 percent. This estimate was based on benefit
calculations including direct employment of MSMEs operating in the KIBP, increased
production in these MSMEs, and increased production and employment in service industries
supplying materials to the park. While this approach is reasonably sound, the assumptions used
to arrive at the valuation estimates proved to be far too optimistic. The analysis assumed that the
KIBP would begin expanded operations during early project implementation. Unfortunately,
however, the cancellation of this sub-component meant that KIBP was not able to reach its
potential as envisaged during the project period. At the end of the project KIBP had only five
tenants, employing 500 people. Moreover, a more accurate valuation at the outset would have
used a considerably higher discount rate (higher than the 20 percent used) to reflect the risk
adjusted opportunity cost of capital.

Sub-component 1.2: Financial Services to MSMEs

4.      An NPV and IRR valuation was not conducted for this sub-component at the time of
project design. Financial analysis of reforms to improve access to finance, such as those
supported under this sub-component, is generally not recommended because of difficulties in
attribution of specific project activities to financial gains of direct beneficiaries. This challenge is
further compounded by the deficient M&E framework that has been noted for this project.
                                                  48 
 
 


However, the relationship between access to finance reform and the performance of firms is well
supported in the literature. Greater business opportunities and better access to finance are
generally related to a more robust private sector (Demirguc-Kunt and Klapper, 2012) which
lends credence to the credit bureau, securities, and trade insurance investments supported by the
project.1 The impact of activities under this sub-component is evaluated in other parts of this
ICR.

Component 2: Enhancing Enterprise Competitiveness

Sub-components 2.1 and 2.2: Matching Grants for Productivity Enhancement, Financial
Management, and Export Growth Sector; Enterprise Skills and Linkages (ESL) Program

5.      MSMEs are the primary beneficiaries for both sub-components 2.1 and 2.2. Accordingly,
the economic and financial analysis of these two sub-components has been combined. In the
original analysis conducted at the design stage, it is unclear as to whether the component analysis
for “matching grant? covered both of these sub-components. Both make use of a matching grant
scheme, however, the information available does not provide clarity on whether the original
analysis focused only on sub-component 2.1 or included both of these sub-components.
A limited amount of data regarding these sub-components has been tracked during monitoring
and evaluation of the project:
             Matching grants: The total number of MSMEs supported was 839 with an average grant
              value of US$4,400. The amount of matched funding put forth by MSMEs was on average
              equal to the grant value. The average increase in revenues for supported businesses was
              125 percent from UGS 314 million to UGS 708 million, with the average number of
              employees increasing from 40 to 48.
             ESL Program: The total number of MSMEs supported was 63. The considerably smaller
              number of MSMEs supported under sub-component 2.2 provides further support for
              combining the analysis of these two sub-components.

6.      At the design stage the economic and financial analysis used a multiplier effect. It was
assumed that each dollar financed/spent through the sub-components would yield five dollars in
benefits for businesses impacted by project activities. This was a critical assumption of the
original design.

7.      Multiplier approach: Using a multiplier approach for economic and financial analysis
can be risky. The most important issue with this approach is the fact that it does not identify or
specify any channels through which the impact of the project occurs. The dollar benefits for
businesses can be incurred in terms of either revenues or profits, both of which yield vastly
different results in terms of the economic rate of return and valuation of a project.

    Paper Series 6088, The World Bank.
                                                               49 
 
 


8.      Other design analysis assumptions: In addition to assuming a multiplier effect, the
project design assumed that 700 MSMEs would participate in the matching grant program every
year over the life of the project. This number is highly inflated, especially given that only 902
MSMEs were supported from sub-components 2.1 and 2.2 in total.

9.      Multiplier value: The multiplier of 5 for the matching grant was generated based on a
relative scale. The analysis states that the previous Uganda PSCP I project used a multiplier of
15. This was adjusted downward for the sake of being conservative. However, the analysis does
not provide any background on how this number was selected in the previous project. This
multiplier could be based on changes in profits or revenues, either of which yields different
results in terms of component valuation. Additionally, there was no discussion on the timing
associated with this increase in output amongst the beneficiaries. For the purposes of this ICR
analysis, the assumption is that the increase in outputs occurs in the year immediately following
the project activities. An increase in revenues for a particular MSME by 5 times in one year is a
highly inflated assumption. If this multiplier applies to profits then the figure is even more
inflated.

10.    Sensitivity analysis: The original project assessment included a sensitivity analysis which
tested variations in the component valuations and the economic rate of returns (ERRs) by
modifying critical variables. This analysis did include modifications of the matching grant sub-
component including changes to the multiplier being used. However, the lowest multiplier for
which sensitivity testing occurs was 2. Even a 2 times increase in revenues for a particular
MSME in one year is considered too high.

11.    Actual impact: Given the data gathered through monitoring and evaluation of the project
for these sub-components, the valuation of these sub-components has been recalculated as
follows:
                       Actual over project life (8 years)
                       ERR                             20%
                       NPV (20% discount rate)         US$27,729

                        Projected over 12 years
                        ERR                             41%
                        NPV (20% discount rate)         US$9,409,072

12.    This analysis is based on the aforementioned data regarding these sub-components
including the total number of MSMEs supported, average grant value, and increase in revenues
for supported businesses. The assumptions used in deriving these valuations are:
          Growth rate for MSMEs without the project activities of 3 percent and the percentage
           of revenues that is devoted to costs is 80 percent. These have been validated by
           regional experts and used in analyses for other projects in Uganda.
          The 12 year valuations for sub-components are based on MSMEs returning to 3
           percent growth rate after year 8.
          Growth rate for MSMEs with the project activities is calculated as 12 percent based
           on the total average revenue growth of 125 percent documented in the project data.

                                               50 
 
 


          Exchange rate from UGS to US$ has been set at the rate of 2,653 UGS = US$1.00 (as
           of project close: Feb 28, 2013).
          The disbursement schedule specific to these two sub-components has been estimated
           as constant per year. The number of MSMEs supported per year ranges from 90-180,
           totaling at 900 for the life of the project.
 
13.     The ERR and NPV figures calculated at the design stage (which assumed a project life of
5 years with benefits projected over 12 years) were 38 percent and US$39.9 million. These
estimated figures vary considerably from the actual calculated above, particularly for the NPVs -
- over US$39 million estimated versus the actual of about US$28,000. For the ERR, the actual
was about half of what was projected – 20 percent versus 38 percent. The significantly actual
lower returns, albeit still positive and may be better in four years’ time, can be attributed to the
fact that there were less beneficiary businesses than anticipated. Moreover, there were
fundamental differences in the methodology used to calculate the returns. Rather than using a
multiplier approach which arbitrarily assigns a total output benefit to companies, the calculation
provided for this ICR analysis uses the revenue and profit growth figures (at the average) for
individual MSMEs to estimate a valuation. This approach does not attribute all revenue growth
of these beneficiaries to the project. Rather, it attributes only that which is likely to be above
what would have occurred even without the project-supported activities. In contrast, the
multiplier approach that had been used at project design attributed all projected revenue growth
in the beneficiary businesses to the project itself.
 
Sub-components 2.3: Business Brand Linkages

14.     The objective of this sub-component was to capture more value from profit margins
associated with existing branding and marketing initiatives especially in export markets. A
limited amount of data regarding this sub-component was tracked:
          8 enterprises and 2 exporting associations received support totaling US$340,000.
          Sample beneficiary results: Star Cafe Limited showed an increase in sales from UGS
           850 million in 2008 to UGS 5.5 billion in 2012. Good African Coffee showed an
           increase in sales from UGS 1.5 billion in 2008 to UGS 4.1 billion in 2010.

15.     The economic and financial analysis of these sub-components used the same multiplier
effect methodology that was used for sub-components 2.1 and 2.2.
 
16.    Multiplier approach: The multiplier approach used in this analysis contains all of the
previously discussed issues in methodology.
 
17.     Multiplier value: The multiplier of 5 for this sub-component was based on a soya case
study which showed that US$1 invested generated US$3 in overall income. The analysis does
not provide adequate support for how this number was generated relative to the lower multiplier
observed in the soya case. Additionally, the multiplier used does not account for timing which
results in a highly inflated assumption as discussed for sub-components 2.1 and 2.2.



                                                51 
 
 


18.   Sensitivity analysis: The sensitivity analysis is inadequate as discussed for sub-
components 2.1 and 2.2 because the lowest multiplier used is 2.

19.      Actual impact: Given the data gathered through monitoring and evaluation of the project
for this sub-component, the valuation of these sub-components has been recalculated as follows:

                          Actual over project life (8 years)
                          ERR                             129%
                          NPV (20% discount rate)         US$4,306,684

                          Projected over 12 years
                          ERR                             131%
                          NPV (20% discount rate)         US$7,157,143

20.     This analysis is based on data from the two aforementioned sample case studies regarding
this sub-component. The assumptions used in deriving these valuations are:
          The two case studies for which detailed information is available have been
           extrapolated to cover all beneficiaries of this sub-component by doubling the
           associated cash flows. This is conservative relative to the fact that 8 enterprises and 2
           associations were beneficiaries of this sub-component.
          The 12 year valuations for sub-components are based on MSMEs returning to the 3
           percent growth rate after the higher sales figured provided for each of the two cases.
           For Star Cafe Limited this was 2012 while for Good African Coffee this was 2010.
          The growth rate between 2008 and 2012 is calculated at 59 percent for Star Cafe
           Limited based the total revenue growth documented in the project data over this
           period. The growth rate between 2008 and 2010 is calculated at 65 percent for Good
           African Coffee based the total revenue growth documented during the period.
          The disbursement schedule specific to these two sub-components has been estimated
           as constant for the first two years of the project.
          Assumptions for growth rate for MSMEs, percentage of revenues that is devoted to
           costs and exchange rate are the same as used for calculations for sub-components 2.1
           and 2.2.

21.     The ERR and NPV figures calculated at the design stage (which assumed a project life of
5 years with benefits projected over 12 years) were 35 percent and US$7.7 million. These
estimated figures vary considerably from the actual shown above -- the actual ERR was 129
percent compared to the estimated 35 percent. The significantly higher actual returns can be
attributed to the fact that there was much larger revenue growth in the beneficiary businesses for
this activity than was projected. Moreover, the expenditure for this sub-component was also less
than estimated – US$350,000 versus the projected amount of US$2.6 million.

Sub-components 2.4: Better Business Behavior Award Scheme

22.    This sub-component was intended to promote “first mover? MSMEs by rewarding on-
time repayment for new investment loans as well as compliance with tax administration and
business registration requirements. The scheme was launched in 2006 and a number of
commercial banks integrated it into their operations without PSCP II financing. Because project
financing was not committed, calculating an actual valuation is not possible, nor was such an
analysis done during the design stage.

Component 3: Improving the Business Environment

23.     Quantifying the impact of business environment reforms is particularly challenging due
to the indirect relationship between the reforms supported under the project and the stream of
benefits triggered. At project design, an attempt was made to quantify the impact of the reforms
under this component, discussed below.

Sub-component 3.1: Land Registration Sector

24.    The overall goal of the land component of the PSCP II was to modernize land
administration and management to ensure smooth, efficient, effective, and transparent delivery of
land services and contribute to an improved business environment. Data regarding this sub-
component was tracked during monitoring and evaluation:
           Daily cost of operations of the land registry estimated at:
            - UGS 2,922,670, with UGS 1,441,000 (for HQs) and UGS 247,000 per regional
              office before the project activities
            - UGS 12,718,264, about UGS 1,413,140 per site including HQs and regional
              offices after the project activities
           Number of and value of new transactions (mortgages, etc.) using land information
            system is estimated at about US$30,000
           Computerization of land records along with other efficiency gains in search, mortgage
            processing, etc.

25.     Cost benefit analysis of land administration reforms is often not done because of
difficulties in attribution of specific project activities to financial gains of direct beneficiaries. In
addition, many benefits are difficult to quantify. Consequently, cost effective analysis is the
methodology that is more frequently used to appraise projects. In this case, government costs
associated with land administration increased due to capacity building of land registry offices
and computerization. Accordingly, the costs of the direct beneficiaries (i.e., the land registry)
actually increased as a result of the project, rather than reducing. However, these capacity
building efforts also included a number of jobs being created to support land administration,
along with time (and thus opportunity cost) savings to the general population.

26.     The monetary benefit of these savings so far is only quantified at US$30,000 in new
transactions, primarily mortgages and searches. But the relationship between stronger property

                                                   53 
 
 


rights and land administration and economic growth factors including labor supply, access to
finance, and investment are generally supported in the literature (Field 2007,2 Johnson et al
2002,3 and Galiani and Schargrodsky 20074). The economic and financial analysis of this sub-
component during project design assumed that 70 percent of the land titles would be sold within
five years of the titles being cleaned and that the value of the land would increase as a result of
the title cleaning process. The analysis also assumed that in the absence of project activities that
a land registration program would have otherwise begun five years later. These were the central
assumptions for analysis of this component.

27.     Approach focusing on sale of newly cleaned titles: This approach does not match the
focus of the project activities which targeted improvements in the land information system.
Although project activities included rehabilitation of existing land records, this was not
exclusively associated with cleaning titles and thus constituted only a portion of the activities. In
addition, the number and/or percentage of land titles sold per year during the project were not
tracked because of the focus on the information system. Key indicators included in the project
results framework were: time to register a property, number of additional titles issued annually,
percentage of government land surveyed, percentage of titles indexed, and number of days to
access land records. However, none of these indicators coincide with the assumptions of the
economic and financial analysis. As such, the analysis did not identify the appropriate channel by
which the project activities would impact the direct beneficiaries (Government institutions) and
indirect beneficiaries (general population accessing records and making land-based transactions).

28.      Assumptions used in design analysis: The economic analysis of the land administration
sub-component does not include any discussion on key assumptions such as the pricing of land
titles, average size, and the total number of titles and plots impacted. Since the entire analysis is
based around a percentage of titles being sold at a higher price, discussion on these assumptions
is critical to the overall analysis. It is not clear whether these assumptions were generated based
on local data, regional benchmarking, or discussions with subject matter experts. Such discussion
is of critical importance to the overall analysis, especially given the budget of US $24 million
was allocated to this sub-component (approximately one-third of the original overall project
budget and about half after restructuring).

29.     Sensitivity analysis: At project design a sensitivity analysis tested variations in the
component valuations and ERRs, by modifying critical variables. However, the sensitivity
analysis does not identify how changes to critical assumptions under this sub-component
translate into changes in the sub-component ERR and that of the project as a whole. For
example, reducing the number of total land titles by 30 percent, reduces the corresponding ERR
by approximately the same percentage. In contrast, reducing the average size of each plot
associated with a particular land title by 30 percent reduces the ERR by close to 50 percent. But
increasing these factors by 30 percent leads to only an approximate 10 percent increase in the

sensitivity analysis, the economic analysis is incomplete.

30.      Actual impact: Because of the aforementioned difficulties in quantifying the impact of
land administration improvements and reforms, this ICR will not recalculate the NPV and ERR
for this sub-component.

Sub-components 3.2 - 3.5: Business Registration; Uganda National Bureau of Standards;
Legal Framework for Business and Financial Services; Public Private Partnership

31.     Because of the difficulties in attribution of business environment reforms, financial
analysis of such components is generally not recommended. Any attempt at identifying specific
impacts in this area can often lead to double-counting with other project interventions or simply
over attribution of other economic factors as results of the project. For example, growth in the
tourism sector in Uganda has been especially robust in the last decade. This could be an
important driver in the number of new businesses registered rather than simplifications to the
registration procedures. Additionally, the number of new businesses registered does not
necessarily imply higher revenues and profits amongst these businesses or the broader economy
as a whole.

32.    However, the relationship between characteristics of the business regulatory environment
and the performance of firms has been well documented (Djankov et a1 2002,6 Botero et al
2004,7 Acemoglu and Johnson 2005,8 Klapper and Richmond 2011,9 and Kaufmann et a1
200610). The impact of these sub-components has been evaluated in other areas of this ICR.

33.     Multiplier approach: The multiplier approach used for this sub-component exhibits the
problems previously discussed for Component 2. Additionally, this approach is extremely
difficult to evaluate ex post. It would be impossible to measure the corresponding increases in
cash flows of all businesses operating in Uganda associated with project activities that improve
registration procedures, standards, and the legal framework. Finally, any multiplier approach
requires usage of a time lag. There is very little analytical basis used in determining this time lag,
which in the case of the project was assumed to be two years.

34.     Multiplier value: The multiplier of 2.5 for these sub-components was generated based on
a relative scale in comparison with Kenya and Tanzania. As discussed previously, the analysis
does not provide adequate support for how this number was generated in any of the comparable

cases, or why it was increased in the case of Uganda. Because of the limited data on the costs
borne by firms in registration procedures, revenue improvements for firms meeting the
publicized domestic and international standards, etc., calculating an actual multiplier for the
business environment activities under these sub-components is not possible.

35.     Sensitivity analysis: The project team included a sensitivity analysis which tested
variations in the component valuations and ERRs by modifying critical variables. However, the
sensitivity analysis of these sub-components does not include modification of the two most
important driving variables: the value of the multiplier itself, and the time lag associated with it.
Reducing the multiplier to 1.5 reduces the ERR by almost half11 and increasing it to 4 leads to an
ERR of over 100 percent. Without including sensitivity analysis on this fundamental variable in
addition to further justification on how the 2.5 multiple was generated, the original analysis is
incomplete.

36.    Actual impact: Because of the aforementioned difficulties in quantifying the impact of
business environment reforms along with the flaws of the multiplier approach, this ICR does not
recalculate the NPV and ERR for these sub-components.

Overall Results

1.       The Second Private Sector Competitiveness Project (PSCPII) supported reforms in land
management and administration, specifically the design, supply and installation of a land
information system, improved access to finance through establishment of the Credit Reference
Bureau, enhancement of enterprise competitiveness and improving the business environment, all
in all to support the development of a vibrant private sector. The overall progress towards Project
Development Objectives and Implementation Progress are both rated moderately satisfactory
despite the weak results framework (making measuring progress difficult to evaluate).

Effectiveness of Component Results (as of February 2013)

Component 1: Developing Infrastructure and Financial Services

2.      Sub-component 1.1 - Infrastructure: Kampala Industrial Business Park (KIBP) Largely,
the project did not achieve the planned developments. However, some outputs were achieved and
include the following: (i) finalization of the KIBP Master Plan; (ii) completion of earthworks that
involved opening up of the roads network (approximately 6.18 km); (iii) major environmental
and social safeguards were addressed; (iv) capacity of UIA was enhanced; and (v) investment
promotion was highly successful (e.g. Presidential Investment Round Table). Five companies
have located in the park employing about 500.

3.      Sub-component 1.2 - Financial Sector Deepening The component focused on ensuring
increase in access to finance at an affordable cost. Among the key outputs of the component are:
(i) the establishment and operationalization of the Credit Reference Bureau for Uganda. This
significantly improved Uganda’s ranking in terms of ease of getting credit against its peers in
183 countries around the world from 109th to 46th in 2010; (ii) the establishment of Securities
Central Depository at the Uganda Securities Exchange; trading increased from three days to 5
days a week; efficiency in terms of effecting settlements improved from t+5 to t+3; (iii)
establishment of the African Trade Insurance underwriting office in Uganda; (iv) capacity
building was undertaken for 2,120 people in the industry; and (v) implementation of three years
of the five year Financial Markets Development Plan.

Component 2: Enhancing Enterprise Competitiveness

4.      The component aimed at improving enterprise capacity particularly for the MSMEs by
increasing investment in skills for women and by raising productivity and improving the quality,
standards, and reliability of MSME producers participating in export value chains. Most of the
indicator targets were achieved namely: (i) overall 95 percent (US$3.9 million) of the sub-
component budget (US$4.1million) was disbursed by project end date and the number of
beneficiaries was 7,528 of which 2,966 (39 percent) were women; (ii) number of target versus
actual ad hoc monitored activities went up by twice the planned margin (over the project
                                                60 
 
 

duration); (iii) cumulatively, 90 percent of reimbursements were successfully completed; (iv)
grants disbursed to sub-regions outside Kampala reached 36 percent compared to original 30
percent by project closure; and (v) the scheme supported a range of activities including; company
diagnostic and planning (18 percent of total reimbursed), domestic marketing and sales (8
percent), feasibility and market research (11 percent), international marketing and sales
promotion (12 percent), management systems (19 percent), production related (7 percent), and
training (25 percent). Other innovative products provided under this component performed well
and these include the Enterprises Skills Linkages where over 4,000 people were trained in
various skills; eight new brands were created under the Business Branding Linkages; over 500
budding entrepreneurs received training and mentorship to formalize their businesses; under the
Technology Acquisition Fund firms received funding to acquire and adopt new technology that
significantly improved their productivity and output.

Component 3 - Improving Business Environment

5.       This project component was meant to strengthen the underlying legal, regulatory and
institutional structures by building on ongoing experiences, in particular, by complementing
activities funded by other development partners. With regard to the land sub-component the
following significant achievements were attained: (i) revival and rehabilitation of the School of
Surveying (renamed Institute of Surveying and Land Management – ISLM) to train professionals
for modern land administration; (ii) development and approval of a new curriculum for ISLM;
(iii) the construction/rehabilitation of 21 land offices to secure the land records; (iv) the
decentralization of responsibilities to these offices; (v) capacity building; (vi) information
campaign; (vii) review of the legal framework; and (viii) design, supply and installation of a land
information system in six Ministry of Lands Zonal Offices.

6.     In the business registry sub-component, basic computerization was undertaken to capture
data and this has improved efficiency at URSB.

7.      Under Uganda National Bureau of Standards sub-component, global good agriculture
practice was supported and also established standards and quality coordination mechanism.
UNBS was supported in preparation of the national standards strategy.

8.     21 business related laws were reviewed by ULRC and 8 were assented to.

9.      PSFU has been strengthened and continues to play a leading role in advocacy. The
project also supported the Presidential Investor Round Table which was established in 2009 and
various meetings were held between the President and the business community semi-annually to
promote private-public dialogue. All these initiatives under PSCPII helped to strengthen public-
private partnerships.

11.       Lessons Learned:
         Design: PSCPII was a multi-sectoral project with many implementing agencies and many
          activities. It was hard to attribute certain aspects of the projects to the whole. It had many
          implementing agencies and beneficiaries. The project should have been much leaner and
          certain components would deserve to be projects in their own right like the KIBP.
         Non-delegatable Project Steering Committee (PSC): Membership affected organizing
          meetings and supervision of the project. The PSC membership comprised of Permanent
          Secretaries from the implementing ministries. In some instances the coordinating staff
          would represent the PSC members who are supposed to be supervising and formulating
          policies. The PSC should be properly constituted with membership that can provide

                                                   62 
 
 

        strategic guidance and not necessarily the Permanent Secretary. It may be the next level
        either Director or Commissioner.
       Failure of the PSC to meet: The PSC meant twice in the first five years of the project.
        This implies the project lacked strategic guidance, direction and naturally went off
        course. The lesson learnt is that the committee needs to meet at least quarterly to receive
        reports, review progress, and provide direction. A technical project implementation team
        should be constituted to support the PSC.
       Delayed effectiveness: The PSCPII was approved in 2004 but only became effective in
        2005, losing one year. It had implications on the ability to achieve the PDOs in the
        planned five years when the project would only have been implemented in 4 years.
        Extension of the project did not improve matters due to the already changed
        circumstances. There is a need to ensure that key stakeholders like Parliament are kept in
        the loop when appraising projects to ensure timely approval.
       Implementing agency capacity: Even when the project became effective, a number of
        implementing agencies’ capacity was wanting and were unready to start implementation.
        It is important that institutional capacity is assessed in good time and or developed prior
        to starting implementation.
       Absence of technical capacity in PSFU and UIA: The project activities involved a lot of
        civil works but PSFU did not have in-house capacity to take charge of civil works
        activities. The project coordinating units needs to be constituted in light of the
        components of the project and desist from over-reliance on consultants.
       M&E framework: The M&E framework was deficient and not well thought out. PSCP II
        did not capture baselines and the results indicators kept changing during implementation.
        Despite the fact that a lot has been achieved under the project it may not be attributable
        due to a poor results framework. The M&E staff was also only recruited in year four of
        the project. During restructuring of the project, the PDO which was already too broad
        was left the same.
       Procurement and contract management: Whereas PSFU was responsible for procurement;
        the respective agencies were responsible for contract management. The agencies for most
        of the time did not provide dedicated staff to undertake contract management. There was
        limited ownership of the beneficiaries. In the future, ministry staff should be seconded to
        the project on full-time basis.
       Project governance: There were lapses in governance especially in terms of the PSC.
        Changes in the project design and restructuring were never approved by PSC.
       Institutional collaboration: Overall, although the project outcomes were generally
        satisfactory there was lack of key institutional collaboration between all the stakeholders.
        Some components experienced a late start largely attributed to the eligibility criteria that
        restricted public or quasi-public agency from benefiting. Interventions of this kind would
        be difficult in absence of involvement of the agencies. Some components were expected
        to build and leverage on other donor funded programs by EU, DANIDA, DFID, and
        USAID all of which closed due to the delayed start of the project. This created excessive
        demand that had not been anticipated.

       Public sector participation: The opportunity for having a well serviced functioning
        industrial park could be lost given the impatience of the industrialists and sluggishness of
        the public sector to deliver the service. Whereas the investment promotions were well
        undertaken by UIA, its benefits were lost largely due to failure of the investors to readily
        access industrial serviced land. There is neither an export processing zone act nor an
        industrial park policy. There is no legal instrument to operationalize the KIBP.
        Environmental concerns were not taken into account when UIA changed location of the
        office block to another site.
       Partnership and alliance with other institutions: Banks have invested in financial literacy
        geared towards improving knowledge and behavior of MSME’s and to make them better
        clients. Partnership and collaboration with other institutions is essential in adaptation and
        implementation for project but also ensuring sustainability of initiatives.
       Legislative review: It was noted that law review cycle is a lengthy and expensive process
        and involves many actors some of whom are beyond the control of the implementer. A
        number of these bills have either not been approved by cabinet or are lying in Parliament.
        Even those accented to lack regulations and remain non-operational. For those that are
        operational the private sector is not aware of them nor have they been sensitized about
        these new acts. Government stands a risk of losing out on the investment made given that
        because of the lengthy cycle of the review process, the bills stand a risk of becoming stale
        prior to their enactment. The media either newspapers, radio, workshops, TV, electronic
        and other social platforms could enhance dissemination of these policies.
       Sustainability: Several of the PSCPII initiatives stand a risk of failure in the event that
        Government does not allocate funding. Future projects need to ensure that mechanism are
        put in place to ensure sustainability of activities and benefits after closure.
