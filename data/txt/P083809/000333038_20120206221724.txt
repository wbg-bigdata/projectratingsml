The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to support the Government’s efforts for the creation of
sustainable conditions conducive to enterprise development and growth, encouraging investment,
facilitating private sector development, increasing micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, increasing
competitiveness in local and export markets and employment opportunities in its territory, through: (a)

                                       RESTRUCTURING PAPER



A.      SUMMARY

1.      This restructuring paper seeks management approval to introduce changes in the Private
Sector Competitiveness Project II (PSCP II), Credit Number 39750-UG, project number
P083809, and any accompanying legal documents. The changes involve: (i) extending the
closing date from January 30, 2012 to February 28, 2013 for one key contract to enable
achievement of the Project Development Objective (PDO); (ii) formalizing changes in project
indicators; (iii) reallocating credit proceeds within the components closing as scheduled on
January 30, 2012; and (iv) cancelling project funds remaining after the reallocation.

2.      The proposed extension is critical to the successful completion of the project, and
ultimately to achieving the project development objectives, as it will enable the completion of
one high-priority contract related to the establishment of a land information system (LIS),
complete the construction of the Kampala District Land office and modifications to the district
land offices which are both linked to the LIS. The contract was signed with an end contract date
far beyond the closing date of the project and the contractors require a firm commitment for
continued World Bank financing in order to conclude the work.1 We have requested Government
of Uganda (GoU) to finance the contract beyond the closing date but available funds could not be
identified. Other options have been considered, such as financing this contract in another project;
however we could not identify an appropriate project in which to do so.

3.     Once the funds for the LIS contract are committed, the undisbursed and uncommitted
funds remaining under the project is US$21.50 million. We propose that these funds be cancelled
in advance of the current closing date of January 30, 2012 to allow for recommitment to ongoing
or new projects in the Uganda portfolio.

4.      The proposed reallocation within components is necessary to provide adequate funding
for the project activities scheduled to close by the current closing date of January 30, 2012, so
that the anticipated benefits can be achieved. Requirements for closing dates extension under
OP/BP13.30 have been met. Specifically, (i) the project objectives continue to be achievable; (ii)
the performance of the Recipient and other project implementing agencies is moderately
satisfactory and measures have been put in place to make it satisfactory; (iii) there are no
outstanding audits, IFRs, and environmental & social safeguards issues; and (iv) since the LIS
contract remains the single pending item, there is no specific action plan for the extension period.



1
  The proposed (second) extension is in line with the Bank’s Operational Policy governing Closing dates (OP.13.30)
that stipulates that, “An extension may be approved for selected disbursements covering only part of a project to
permit implementation of high-priority contracts?, and also that, “A longer extension is allowed only when the
borrower, suppliers, contractors, or consultants require a firm commitment for continued Bank financing?.

B.      PROJECT STATUS

5.     The PSCP II was approved on September 2, 2004. The Project's Development Objective
(PDO) is to support the Government’s efforts for the creation of sustainable conditions
conducive to enterprise development and growth, encouraging investment, facilitating private
sector development, increasing micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, increasing
competitiveness in local and export markets and employment opportunities in its territory,
through: (a) reduction of the cost of doing business; and (b) improvement of business
environment and public-private dialogue.2

6.     The project closing date was extended from January 31, 2010 to January 30, 2012. The
proposed extension is until February 28, 2013.

7.    PSCP II’s progress towards achievement of project development objectives and
implementation progress are both rated Moderately Satisfactory. As of January 12, 2012,
US$39.3 million (53.7% of the original credit) has been disbursed.

8.      PSCP II’s Component 1, Developing Infrastructure and Financial Services has two sub-
components. For Sub-component A: Providing Basic Infrastructure Services for the Private
sector, progress has been unsatisfactory. Important delays were encountered during the
establishment of the Kampala Industrial Business Park due to environmental, procurement and
management concerns. Remedial measures were identified; however implementing them would
take about three years, way beyond a reasonable project extension period. Through discussions,
GoU decided to cancel this sub-component with GoU identifying other sources of funding for
finalization of the industrial park. Sub-component B: Financial Sector deepening program has
been completed and it is satisfactory.

9.      Component 2 - Enhancing Enterprise Competitiveness has been completed and is highly
satisfactory.

10.    The activities of Component 3 - Improving the Business Environment are almost
completed with the exception of the land reform sub-component where the critical contract for
the Land Information System, for which the extension is sought, will be completed by February
28, 2013. Results under this sub-component have been satisfactory.

11.    Overall project achievements to date include: rehabilitation and modernization of the
Land Registry; construction of 13 district land offices; rehabilitation of the Survey School,
construction of the Administration and Resources Center building; construction of the Records
and Archival Center building; development of a Land Information System (LIS) and construction
of the LIS Center; establishment of the Credit Reference Bureau and the Securities Central
Depository; increase in enterprise capacities with 7,530 beneficiaries, out of which 2,860 are
women; 17 bills have been drafted/updated, eight laws assented and the Enterprise Skills
Linkage program has trained 2,690 people in skills development.

 The Project Development Objectives as mentioned in the Financing Agreement and the Project Appraisal
Document are the same in substance but somewhat differ in language. For ease of further processing the project uses
consistently the PDO as stated in the Financing Agreement.

C.     PROPOSED CHANGES

1.     Closing date

12.    The closing date for the Uganda, Private Sector Competitiveness Project II, Loan Credit
No. 39750-UG, is proposed to be extended from January 30, 2012 until February 28, 2013.

13.     The proposed extension is important to enable completion of the high priority and critical
Land Information System (LIS) contract of US$11 million (undisbursed balance is US$7
million) and thus achieve the Project Development Objective. This contract was signed with an
end-date far beyond the project closing date. Properly implemented LIS will allow the securing
of land records, increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of land information management and
availability of such information for government, business and the public. LIS will significantly
reduce the time for land registration (from months and weeks to a few days or hours depending
on the case), as well as the presentation of information and extracts (from days to hours or online
depending of the type of information). The system (i) provides full control over all transactions
in the system; (ii) ensures that transactions are made according to established procedures making
the system transparent and all transactions traceable, reducing possibilities of any back door or
corruptive practices; and (iii) will significantly increase public confidence in land administration.
Extending the LIS contract will enable the completion of the land reform sub-component of the
project and the link with the already constructed district land offices. The extension will also
enable completion of the construction of the Kampala District Land office and modifications to
the district land offices which are both linked to the LIS. The benefits expected from the ongoing
modernization of the land registries and the production, updating and utilization of land
information necessary to fully benefit from the investment in the Land Information System (LIS)
will be realized. All the other components and sub-components will be closed and only the land
reform sub-component extended. The implementation of the LIS will be closely supervised and
an annual review of compliance will be done.

14.    This will be the second extension of the project. No further extension will be sought.

2.     Cancellation of Project funds

15.     There were delays in implementing the establishment of the Kampala Industrial Business
Park (KIBP), which could not be implemented within a reasonable extension of the life of the
project. The delays relate to environmental issues and the procurement process. The Government
decided to cancel this sub-component and to fund the park using other resources. The
uncommitted and undisbursed funds of US$21.50 million will be cancelled in advance of the
current closing date of January 30, 2012 to allow for recommitment to ongoing or new projects
in the Uganda portfolio.

3.     Funds reallocation

16.      The proposed reallocation is necessary to enable adequate funding for the project
activities scheduled to close by the original closing date of January 30, 2012 so that the
anticipated benefits are achieved. This reallocation was identified at the Mid-Term Review



                                                 8
(MTR), but was not done due to the unsatisfactory rating of the project at the time. The proposed
changes are shown in Annex 2.

17.     Goods. Construction of the District Land Offices (DLO) is complete; however, furniture,
equipment and computers need to be provided to make them operational. In addition, the
allocation available under goods is currently insufficient to cover the remaining balance of the
LIS contract. A reallocation of US$880,000 will be made from “Category 3b: Consultancy
Services? to “Category 2b: Goods? to fund the activities.

18.    Civil Works for Lands. As construction of district land offices is completed, variations
are required to secure the DLOs and make them ready for LIS. In addition, actual costs at which
DLOs were contracted were higher than the planned costs established at project appraisal due to
under budgeting. A reallocation of US$676,000 will be made from “Category 3b: Consultancy
Services? to “Category 1b: Civil Works for Part B.2 and 3? to fund these activities.

19.      Operational Costs. At the design phase it was anticipated that all costs to be incurred in
the lands reform sub-component, Uganda Investment Authority (UIA) and Business Plan
Competition would either be goods, civil works or consultancy services. However, during
implementation, expenses of an operational nature were incurred and charged on the operational
cost category of Schedule 1 of the DCA. This reduced available operational funds to other
activities as planned. A reallocation of US$1,161,000 will be made from “Category 3b:
Consultancy Services? to “Category 8: Operational Costs? to enable completion of project
activities.

4.     Results Framework and Monitoring

20.     The monitoring and evaluation (M&E) framework was discussed and reviewed
during the Mid-Term Review (MTR) mission and recorded in the Aide Memoire of November
2008 with changes agreed upon with the authorities. At that time, appropriate baselines were
established and it was agreed to refocus/replace some of the PDO Outcome Indicators and
Intermediate Outcome Indicators that would be more realistic and for which data would be
available for monitoring. New indicators were added to monitor the expanded financial sector
services sub-component. The attached Annex 1 provides what was dropped from the M&E
framework in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) as well as the changes agreed during
the MTR. Due to the cancellation of the construction of the KIBP industrial park by the
Government, the associated indicators were dropped (land access and site development were to
be reduced from 435 days to 70 days by project end). Some of these changes were incorporated
earlier and authorities were informed by letter dated January 22, 2009 signed by the World Bank
Country Director for Uganda. Authorities have been collecting the data onwards; this
Restructuring Paper formalizes these changes and in addition ensures that PDO indicators are
adequate to monitor progress toward meeting the PDO.

5.     Project Implementation

21.    The GoU is committed to implement the necessary measures to ensure timely completion
of the remaining sub-component under the project. To address procurement delays, several
meetings between the World Bank project team, the project implementation unit, the Ministry of


                                                9
Finance, Planning and Economic Development (MoFPED) and other stakeholders involved in
the project have been held. These meetings resulted in the commitment of the MoFPED to hold
regular project steering committee meetings to keep implementation firmly on track.
