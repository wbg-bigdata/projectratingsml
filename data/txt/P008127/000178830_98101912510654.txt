I.   THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR
A.   Introduction
1.01       The Uruguayan economy is currently recuperating from the economic
woes of the sixties and early seventies when per capita income declined,
capital stock was run down and the economy suffered from severe balance of
payments problems and a high rate of inflation. With a balance of payments
crisis triggered by the oil price increase and closure of the EEC market to
meat imports, as well as a deteriorating fiscal situati6n and accelerating
inflation, stabilization had to be the government's first priority beginning
in 1974. The high level of consumption in the previous decade had been achieved
at the expense of investment and exports,' resulting in low overall growth,
interrupted by periodic economic crises. Thus, a basic shift in economic
policy was indicated and the government adopted policies, beginning in 1974,
which placed greater reliance on the price mechanism to improve resource
allocation and productive efficiency. Since then, private investment and
non-traditional exports have been encouraged, the public finances placed on
a sounder footing, and the operation of the financial system improved. This
reorientation has resulted in steady growth in output, employment, and invest-
ment, a favorable balance of payments with a sharp increase in reserves, and
an improved fiscal situation.  However, high inflation, averaging about 60%
during 1976-79, continues to be a problem, although it has started to come
down from 83% in 1979 to 50% (on an annual basis) in the first nine months
of 1980.
1.02      Last year's economic growth of 8.4% was the highest in 33 years.
The strongest sectoral performances come from industry (10.1%), domestic
retailing (14.9%), construction (19.9%), and fishing (38.8%). In important
respects, however, economic performance in 1979 was somewhat exceptional.
Strong demand by Argentinian investors and tourists for relatively low-cost
Uruguayan goods and fixed assets (mostly real estate) was a key factor contri-
buting to the exceptional growth of industry, commerce and construction, but
also led to an acceleration of domestic inflation. Since the peso appreciated
in real terms (on an export weighted basis) by 14% in 1979, Uruguay has now
shifted from being a relatively low-cost market to a moderately high one.
Consequently, foreign investments and tourist expenditures are expected to be
moderate this year. Nevertheless, a GDP growth rate in the 4-5% range seems
feasible in 1980, still high by historical Uruguayan standards.
1.03      Recent government policies have  placed increasing emphasis on the
export-oriented growth strategy initiated in 1972. In December 1978, after
many years of discussion, a major decision was taken by the government to
restructure the industrial sector by encouraging efficiency through a Tariff
Reduction Program (Decree 736/978). According to this Decree, all import
charges of a tax nature will be combined into one single "global" tariff,
which, in five years starting January 1, 1980, will be reduced each year in
the same percentage from its starting level to reach a uniform level of 35% at
the end of the fifth year. Most products that are not produced domestically
have been subject to the 35% duty since January 1, 1980.



-2-
1.04      Many industrial firms will need to increase their operational effi-
ciency in order to remain competitive with imports as the Tariff Reduction
Program (TRP) is implemented. The proposed project is designed to encourage
and support the government's efforts to implement the TRP and to assist
industrial firms to adjust to the more competitive environment by providing
term finance for equipment modernization and replacement and for capacity
expansions. The project would build on the efforts initiated under the
Bank's first industrial credit project (Loan 1176-UR, approved in December
1975) to create an effective institutional framework for industrial project
formulation, appraisal and term financing. The focus of the first project on
the expansion of Uruguayan non-traditional exports would be broadened to
include assistance to industries serving the domestic market to enable them to
become internationally more competitive and to expand their capacity in line
with projected growth in domestic demand.
B.   Recent Performance of the Sector
1.05      Growth.  After almost two decades of stagnation with output rising
less than 1% p.a. between 1955 and 1974, manufacturing industry in Uruguay has
developed a new dynamism with the annual growth in production averaging 7.5%
between 1974 and 1979. The rise in output of more than 10% achieved in 1979
represented the largest annual increase since 1953. During the last six
years, industrial growth performance exceeded that of the rest of the economy
as GDP rose by about 5% p.a. As a consequence, industry's share in GDP has
risen from 23.0% in 1973 to 26.6% in 1979 (Annex 1, Table 1.3).
1.06      The surge in economic activity which has recently developed is
associated with the measures which the government has taken since 1972 and
particularly since 1974 to reverse the previous inward-oriented strategy and
to open the economy. Among the specific measures taken was the adoption of
a new exchange rate policy (para. 1.17) which, at least through 1978, was
combined with incentives for non-traditional exports to encourage an external
orientation for industry. Further measures have included the lifting of con-
trols on interest rates and on prices of a large number of traded goods,
as well as the beginning of import liberalization.
1.07      Reflecting the impact of this movement towards a more open economy,
the share of exports of goods and non-factor services in GDP grew from 13.7%
in 1973 in current prices to 18.9% in 1977, but declined slightly in 1978 and
even more so in 1979 (Annex 1, Table 1.1). In the latter two years there were
sharp expansions in demand within domestic markets, although some of this
probably reflected indirect exports stemming from purchases by the large number
of Argentine tourists who have been visiting the country. The expansion
of exports was highly concentrated among non-traditional manufactures based
largely on local raw materials; as compared with 34% of total exports in 1974,
these items accounted for 61% in 1979 (Annex 1, Table 1.8). Exports of
manufactured products (excluding food, beverages and tobacco) represented
about 15% of the gross value of comparable industrial output in 1978 as
compared to some 7% in 1974.



-3-
1.08      Exports.  Through 1977, the exports of manufactured goods played
the major role in the expansion of industrial output, with relative increases
in export volume well in excess of those in output. Beginning in 1978,
domestic demand began to recover, and in 1979 the rate of growth of industrial
output exceeded that of exports of non-traditional industrial products.

1.09       The main manufactured export products are based on wool and leather.
Uruguay had traditionally been a major world exporter of both raw wool and
hides and skins. In response to the recent exchange rate and export incentive
policies, the country has now moved towards the export of more advanced
manufactures of these items which are sold in the main developed countries'
markets. This evolution has been most marked in the case of leather 1/ where
there has been virtually no exports of raw hides since the early 1970s and the
share of tanned leather in the value of total leather exports has declined
from about 60% in 1974 to less than 25% in 1979. The growth items in this devel-
opment have been leather garments and shoes which, because of their relatively
high labor intensity, have had a significant employment-generating impact.  In
the case of wool, the structural change in exports has until recently been
more moderate. Raw wool (including both greasy and washed) continues to
represent a substantial share of trade in this category, although wool tops
(washed and carded wool ready for spinning) and cloth have shown significant
increases. However, in more recent years, and especially in 1979, there has
been a substantial expansion in exports of woolen garments as world demand for
these items appears to have risen, particularly after the mid-1979 energy
crisis. These items are also important in generating new employment oppor-
tunities.
1.10       Exports of other manufactured products, such as automobile parts,
tires, paper, ceramics, cement and industrial chemicals have also shown rela-
tively large increases. Many of these products are sold within the LAFTA
region, particularly to Argentina and Brazil, and benefit from regional
preference arrangements as well as from the special bilateral trade agreements
1/   Export incentives had been provided as early as the mid-1960s to favor
the exports of tanned leather and products.

established by those two neighboring countries. 1/ Exports to Argentina have
risen most sharply in the last two years as the Argentine government's exchange
rate policy has made imports relatively cheap and Uruguay's location has
enabled it to take advantage of this situation.
1.11      As a consequence of the growth of manufactured exports there have
been some modifications in the structure of industry. Export-oriented sub-
sectors (e.g. textiles, clothing, shoes and leather products) increased their
shares in total value added in the sector while those subsectors dependent
upon the local market (e.g. metals, machinery and equipment) or traditional
exports (e.g. food, beverages and tobacco) experienced declines.

1.12      Employment and wages.  The recent expansion in industrial output and
its particular composition has resulted in substantial employment generation.
Since 1975, the increase in employment as measured by the Central Bank's index
of occupation in industry, 2/ has remarkably paralleled the growth of the
value added in manufacturing in constant prices.  The major factor in this
development has been the growth in the labor-intensive branches such as
clothing, shoes and leather products. Based on sample data obtained in the
Annual Survey of Industry prepared by the official census agency, it would
appear that more than 40% of the increase in employment between 1973 and 1978
was accounted for by the clothing and shoe and leather products industries,
which in the former year represented only about 15% of total industrial
employment. Another 20% of the employment increment was due to the expansion
in the automotive and parts industries, which have experienced both export
growth due to the special LAFTA and bilateral trade agreements with Argentina
and Brazil, and increases in domestic demand.

1.13      The increase in industrial employment has played a major role
in reducing the general level of unemployment in the Uruguayan economy. For
the Montevideo area (representing more than 50% of the total population), the
unemployment rate declined from 12.7% at the beginning of 1976 to 8.6% in
the first quarter of 1979. By the end of 1979, there were indications of
labor shortages in a number of areas, particularly in Punta del Este where the
construction boom has been especially important.
1.14      The period has also been characterized by a sharp fall in real wage
rates for those employed in manufacturing as a consequence of the persistently
relatively high inflation. There have been, on the other hand, increases
in average hours worked so that real wage incomes have not fallen as sharply.
However, while the total wage bill for the sector has not changed significantly
in real terms since 1975, as a consequence of the rapid growth of the sector
the share of wage income in value added has tended to decline.

1.15      Investment and imports of capital goods.  For the economy as a
whole, gross investment has shown a sharply rising trend during the 1970s,
increasing from 10-12% of GDP in the early years of the decade to about 15%
in later years (Annex 1, Table 1.1). In addition, imports of capital goods
have risen at an average annual rate of about 12% since 1975. However, no

sectoral details are available to determine the relative movements for indus-
trial and agricultural investment or for construction. There apparently have
been a number of new export-oriented firms established in recent years but
most of these (e.g. garments) have low fixed asset requirements. Interviews
with executives of existing plants selling mainly in the domestic market
suggest that the recent period of improved activity and profitability has
permitted many enterprises to undertake important rehabilitation and moderni-
zation programs.
1.16      In mid-1973 the government adopted an industrial investment pro-
motion law to encourage the growth of industries of "national interest". The
main incentive is a reduction of the tariffs on imported capital goods to 10%.
Since the establishment of the mechanisms for administering the law in early
1974, there has been a substantial flow of requests for obtaining its benefits.

1.17      Size of enterprises.  The latest published census of economic activ-
ities was for the year 1968. In December 1979 a new census was undertaken
but the results are not yet available. Some indication of the trends in the
size distribution of enterprises can be obtained by analyzing statistics
available from various sources; however, because the data are not completely
comparable, they must be interpreted with caution.
1.18      During the 1960s, more than half of the workers employed in indus-
try were employed in smaller enterprises with up to 49 employees. About one-
fifth of the total were found among the firms with less than five employees.
This was the period of high protection with production excessively diversified,
serving a limited domestic market and unable to take advantage of economies
of scale. By 1977, however, the smaller enterprises (under 50 employees)
accounted for only two-fifths of the total employment in industry. This
decline may be slightly overstated since the survey on which the distribution
is based may have not been as comprehensive as the sources of the data for
the 1960s. The trend reflected mainly the growth of the larger export-oriented
enterprises. While many of these (e.g. leather products, garments) are not
subject to economies of scale in production, the magnitude of output has to
be relatively large to meet export requirements.

C.   Principal Policy Issues
Exchange Rate and Export Incentive Policies
1.19      In 1972 the government introduced the policy of periodic mini-
devaluations ("crawling peg") in contrast to the prior practice of irregular
major devaluations. Since October 1978, the devaluations on a daily basis
have been pre-announced first for a period of nine months and, more recently,
for periods of six months in advance; in June 1980, the rates prevailing through
the end of calendar year 1980 were fixed. The intention of this policy has been
to use exchange rate policy to reduce inflation, as the pre-announced rates
have generally been below the difference between domestic and international
inflation. 1/
1.20      From 1973 through 1977, the measures taken by the authorities
provided in general a substantial depreciation of the real exchange rate, the
only exception being in the year 1974. With the introduction of the pre-
announced rates, the peso experienced a small appreciation in 1978 but a very
large real appreciation in 1979 which brought it below the 1973 level.

Uruguay, Report No. 2706-UR, June 1980.

a/ The data in parenthesis represent the ratio of export rebates to the
total value of exports eligible for rebates; these data are only
available since 1976.
1.21      The real exchange rate devaluation has played an important role
in improving the international competitiveness of Uruguayan manufacturers, but
the establishment of a number of incentive programs has also been critical in
making Uruguayan products internationally competitive and exporting profitable.
While a system of rebates for exports of selected non-traditional products
had actually been initiated in the mid-1960s, it was not until 1972/73 that a
new, more comprehensive system was developed. Under this program, the per-
centage of the rebate ("re-integro") offered to exporters ranged as high as
46% for certain consumer goods products. The initial levels were set for
a three-year period ending mid-1975, after which there would be annual reduc-
tions. Reductions were introduced through mid-1978 but the rates established
for 1978/79 were maintained through 1979/80. In June 1980, the Minister of
Economy announced the intention of the government to continue the "re-integros"
at the existing levels until the end of 1981. At that time, the rates would
be gradually reduced to reach a uniform 5% level at the end of 1985, a level
equivalent to the estimated burden of indirect taxes. This statement repre-
sented the elaboration of a policy declaration made by the government in
December 1979 when it announced its adherence to the new GATT Code on Sub-
sidies and Countervailing Duties.
1.22      At the end of 1978, the Uruguayan authorities sharply curtailed
"re-integros" for certain woolen and leather products exported to the United
States, although retaining the program for exports to other markets. This
measure was taken after the US Government moved to impose countervailing
duties on imports of these items from Uruguay, and resulted in sharp declines
in these exports to that market. In March 1980, following the adherence
of the government to the new GATT Code, the authorities re-instated the
previous levels of the export incentives for these items. As subsequently
spelled out in the June 1980 policy declaration, these will be reduced to
the uniform 5% level by the end of 1985.



-9-
1.23      Uruguay's production and exports of the particular items in 1979
were adversely affected by the suspension of the incentives, although some
producers were able to shift their selling efforts to European markets and/or
to increase sales to the domestic market. The reintroduction of the incen-
tives in March 1980 is expected to have limited impact on exports in the
current year, since the measures came too late in the "buying season" for a
number of US importers. However, in the short run exporters of woolen products
are expected to benefit most from the new situation since demand for these
items appears to be relatively buoyant in spite of the recession in the
US market. 1/
1.24      As an additional measure to stimulate exports, highly concessional
interest rates for financing both production for export and export shipments
("pre-anticipos") were introduced in 1976. Data are not available on the actual
volume of such financing, but interviews with exporters indicate that the
subsidy element was rather substantial, although it varied over time. In line
with other measures adopted in the course of 1978 and 1979 to remove controls
on interest rates, this system of financing was discontinued.
The Tariff Reduction Program (TRP)
1.25      Import liberalization has represented a major objective of official
policy since the early 1970s. A first important step was taken in 1975 with
the elimination of import quotas, but the major task remained of overhauling
the extremely complex import protection system which includes tariffs,
surcharges, consular fees, port charges, arbitrary fixed product prices
("aforos") having no relation to actual prices and upon which the surcharges
are applied, and multiple administrative requirements. In December 1978, a
decree was issued establishing guidelines to reduce the overall level of
protection through (a) consolidating all tariffs, surcharges and special taxes
into a single global rate which would be lowered to a uniform 35% by 1985 on
the basis of annual equal reductions beginning January 1, 1980; (b) unifying
the administrative requirements which are currently supervised by at least
three agencies of the government; and (c) eliminating the "aforo" system.
1.26     An interministerial committee was established with responsibility
for working out the details of implementation which were to be elaborated in
the decree incorporating the first of the annual equal reductions due on
January 1, 1980. In the course of its work during 1979, the committee recom-
mended immediate tariff reductions to the 35% target level for about 500 items
which were not being produced locally, and substantial tariff reductions for a
small number of items where price rises had occurred faster than justified by
local cost increases. The committee also drafted anti-dumping legislation,
including a system of countervailing duties which was submitted for further
consideration by the government.
1/   In addition, to the "re-integros", exports of wool products benefit
from a special "bonificacion" equal to 22% of export value.



- 10 -
1.27      The bulk of the committee's work was embodied in a decree pub-
lished on January 14, 1980 which incorporated the tariff reduction for 1980,
as scheduled in the December 1978 decree. A single tariff classification was
defined and single tariff rates were established for these items incorporating
the four previous components--the "normal" tariff, the surcharges, consular
fees and port charges. However, because of administrative difficulties
the components were separately identified, and in place of the expected single
collection, each of the participating agencies would continue collecting its
individual share.
1.28      In addition, although the principle of applying the tariffs to
c.i.f. import prices was established, authority was given to the Minister of
Economy to formulate a system of reference prices to establish tariffs for
import items in instances where redundant protection was evidenced or when it
was shown that dumping was taking place. By administrative decree in March
1980, a reference price system was established based on the prior "aforo"
system.
1.29      The value of imports has risen steadily since the first petroleum
price increase at the end of 1973; imports of goods and non-financial ser-
vices represented 11-14% of GDP in the 1970-73 period, but since 1977 have
exceedcP" 20%. During these latter years, however, the main elements in the
import rise have been non-petroleum items (see Annex 1, Table 1.9). In 1979,
the value of imports rose by alrost 60% over the previous year, more than half
of that due to volume increases in virtually i1l categories of products other
than petroleum.  This expansion reflects in part the measures taken during
1979 1/ to reduce tariff protection. Nevertheless, there was a sliarp increase
in actual tariff receipts as a percentage of the total value of imports. The
number of items on which tariffs were collected rose from 4,000 in 1978 to
8,400 in 1979. For a number of products not produced in the country and not
previously imported, cutting the previous prohibitively high tariff levels has
apparently led to the emergence of new imports at lower (but still substantial)
tariff rates. Moreover, for those imported products competing with domestic
production, the high effective protection afforded by the prevailing system 2/
may have been eroded by the appreciation of the real exchange rate in that
year, i.e., net effective protection may have been reduced. The study of the
import liberalization process which is to be undertaken in connection with
the proposed loan (para. 4.12) is expected to examine in more detail the
precise nature of the impact of that process on these trade movements to
permit better evaluation of policy alternatives.
1/   In addition to the measures cited in paras. 1.23 and 1.24, maximum
surcharge levels were reduced twice in 1979.
2/   Average effective production in 1977, based on legal tariff rates and
surcharges (i.e. not allowing for tariff redundancy) was estimated at
139%. See J.J. Anichini, J. Caumont and L. Sjaastad, La Politica
Comercial y la Proteccion en el Uruguay (Montevideo, 1977).

1.30      Continued progress in meeting the timetable for import liberaliza-
tion established in the decree of December 1978 is essential for the future
viability of the Uruguayan economy and to avoid repeating the economic
stagnation and social deterioration experienced in the twenty-year period
after 1955.  Thus the proposed project would be geared to finance efficient
industrial, agroindustrial and tourism projects, within the framework of
the government's import liberalization policies established in the decree
of December 1978 and regulated in the decree of January 1980 (see para. 4.02).
Moreover, the achievement of targets under the government's Tariff Reduction
Program (TRP) will be analyzed in a study to be financed under the proposed
project (para. 4.12), which will be reviewed between the government and the
Bank not later than June 30, 1982, with the purpose of determining whether
targets have been achieved allowing future subprojects to be financed under
the project. If it were found that this is not the case, and that the situa-
tion could not be expected to be remedied within a reasonable period satis-
factory to the Bank, no further subprojects could be approved.
D.   Medium-Term Outlook
1.31      In mid-1980, the situation facing the industrial sector was beset
by some uncertainty. On the one hand, the sector was apparently close to full
utilization of capacity as a result of the fast growth conditions in the
economy, and further increases in output were increasingly dependent upon new
investment. A large number of enterprises were cautious, however, with regard
to expansion plans. This was particularly the case for the export-oriented
industries whose international competitiveness has been affected by the
appreciation of the real exchange rate and the reduction of export incentives.
Moreover, the recession in world markets raised some questions as to future
demand growth. For a number of industries which have benefitted particularly
from the relatively advantageous position Uruguayan products face in



- 12 -
Argentine markets, or from the flow of tourists to Uruguayan resorts, the
special problems of uncertainty over income growth in Argentina posed addi-
tional obstacles to further investment plans. Similarly, industries which had
become dependent upon exports to Brazil, particularly those items subject to
preferential treatment under the bilateral agreement, were confronted in
December 1979 with a major change in their competitive position as a result of
the substantial cruzeiro devaluation and the general liberalization of Brazilian
imports, eliminating the administrative basis for preferential treatment. 1/
In the early months of 1980, official trade between the two countries came to
a virtual halt.
1.32      Among those industries primarily oriented towards the domestic
market, major concern lies with the impact of the import liberalization
program. Interviews with industrialists 2/ indicate that many had begun to
undertake the ite..nssary modernization and rehabilitation programs to permit
them to compete witih imports. Moreover, many had already begun the process
of ad,usting their product mix, reducing the excessive diversification of
output and tending to specialize in a smaller number of products. In this
connection, a number of entrepreneurs felt that the liberalization measures
would provide them with access to cheaper and better quality imported interme-
diate goods, which in turn would enable them to compete more favorably with
imports of finished products.
1.33      For the bulk of those enterprises serving the local market, the
shift from the import-substitution industrialization strategy to a more open
economy approach should not cause major dislocations. The size of the domestic
matrket is relatively large and the population is mainly concentrated in one
area. Under these circumstances, economically viable production is possible
for a wide range of finished consumer goods and of many agricultural and
construction inputs where economies of scale are not significant or where
transport costs are important. Moreover, as evidenced by trade patterns
during more normal periods, a good portion of Southern Brazil and parts of
Argentina along the Uruguay River lie within a natural market area for numerous
Uruguayan products. These enterprises will, however, require important invest-
ment programs to modernize and improve efficiency and, as noted above, some
have already begun that process.
1/   For example, certain imports from Uruguay were not subject to prior
deposits, which were equivalent to a 50% tariff; eliminating the prior
deposit system thus removes an important preferential position for the
exempted items.
2/   A Bank mission visited Uruguay in December 1979 to study in particular
the possible impact on existing industry of the liberalization program.
Preliminary findings of that mission have been used in the discussion in
this report. The full report of the mission is expected to be published
later this year.



- 13 -
1.34       There are, nevertheless, a group of industries which have been
dependent in part on excessively high effective protection and which are
expected to have greater difficulties in meeting external competition under
a more liberal import policy. Most of these are among consumer electric and
electronic appliances and mechanical engineering branches and are based on
importing components with low or no tariffs, while the final products are
subject to high tariffs. Several of these enterprises have already begun to
rationalize their production, specializing in one or a limited number of
products, and some have been able to develop export capacity. These have
included skill-intensive products such as dies, metal fasteners and simple
agricultural tools which benefit from the availability of relatively inexpen-
sive skilled labor in the country.
1.35       The most significant impact of these new policies would be to shift
the terms of trade 1/ towards agriculture and to enco.re greater investment
in, as well as diversification of, that sector. To some extent, this will
lead to the production of many agricultural items which will be subject to
further processing, particularly for export. Agro-industries are likely to be
among the more dynamic manufacturing activities in the future and new projects
will tend to concentrate in these sub-branches. Some examples which have
already emerged are milk-based concentrated protein solids and a wide range of
processed fruits and vegetables, as well as the entire group of processed fish
and shellfish. 2/
1.36       According to a recent survey of 99 medium to large industrial firms
undertaken by the Ministry of Industry at the Bank's request, intended indus-
trial investment in 1980-82 appears to be quite substantial when compared to
previous years. The surveyed firms indicated planned investments for a total
of US$208 million in 1980-82, primarily to modernize their plants, to improve
product quality or to reduce operating costs. A further indication of a
strong demand is the fact that the available funds under Loan 1176-UR to
finance export-oriented projects were committed at a rate of US$1 million per
month in the past six months, well above the rate achieved in earlier periods.
PAT's pipeline of projects requesting financing amounted to US$46 million as
of June 30, 1980 (see Annex 5).
1.37       The actual implementation of these investment programs will depend
upon continued favorable market trends. Maintenance of overall domestic
demand growth at reasonably high levels will provide considerable stimulus to
those industries serving the domestic market. Further growth of the export-
oriented industries can, however, be affected by any continued divergence
between domestic and international inflation which is not offset by nominal
devaluation. While there are indications that total export value was continuing
1/   In the statistical sense, the share of industry in GDP may experience
some decline in the immediate future due to the existing price distortions
which overvalue manufacturing activities particularly if expressed in
international prices.

to increase in the first semester of 1980, export performance varied consid-
erably among the different subsectors and overall there appears to have been
a decline of 5.7% in volume. Exports of wool and woolen products continued to
show some rise due to generally good world market conditions for these items
and there appears to bavi been some recovery in exports of leather products,
excluding shoes. Buoyant domestic demand for construction materials such as
cement and ceramic products appears to be reducing supplies of those items
available for export.
II. THE FINANCIAL SECTOR
A.   The Financial System
2.01      The banking system in Uruguay comprises the Central Bank of Uruguay
(BCU), 3 state banks (Banco de la Republica, BROU, the Mortgage Bank and
the Insurance Bank 1/), 21 private commercial banks and 17 casas bancarias.
Casas bancarias are new institutions that have been allowed to establish since
1977, to engage in all operations open to commercial banks, except obtaining
deposits from Uruguayan residents and offering checking account facilities.
The financial system comprises, in addition, several small insurance companies
(life, fire and maritime transport) and the Montevideo Stock Exchange (MSE). 2/
Currently there are no development banks in Uruguay.
2.02      The Banco Central del Uruguay was established in 1966 with responsi-
bilities for formulating ind executing monetary and credit policy, supervising
and controlling the banking system, issuing currency and managing international
reserves. Until 1966, BROU was in charge of central banking activities, and
while most of these functions are now in the hands of BCU, BROU remains in
charge of some fiscal activities for the government (e.g. collection of some
excise duties and tariffs) and some official foreign exchange transactions. 3/
BCU presently has 720 employees, and is organized in five operating divisions
(Financial Management, Economic Studies, Foreign Transactions, Administration
and Accounting, and Controller of the Financial System), and three advisory
units (the Legal Department, the Internal Auditing Department, and the General
Secretariat). In addition to its central banking functions, BCU has administered
1/   The Mortgage Bank provides long-term housing financing.  Its portfolio
with the private sector amounted to NUr$2,516 million as of December 31,
1979. The Insurance Bank has a monopoly on labor, accident and property
insurance in Uruguay.
2/   MSE was established in 1923.  Its role in mobilizing financial resources
to productive enterprises has been declining over the last two decades.
Total transaction during 1978 amounted to NUr$1.091 million (about
US$156 million equivalent), of which only about 10% represented trading
of private enterprise of common shares.

various development credit lines (industry, agriculture, livestock and
fishing) from international or bilateral institutions and a guarantee
fund (para 3.16) established under the first industrial credit project.
2.03      The commercial banking system.  Commercial banks were severely
affected by several Uruguayan economic crises in the 1963-74 period, when the
total number of private banks decreased from 81 to 21 as a result of financial
failures or mergers to avoid bankruptcies. In 1965, the government issued a
prohibition against establishing new private banks to help minimize financial
difficulties to existing banks. This prohibition has tended to inhibit
competition among banks, which in turn has affected the quality and variety of
banking services. The new government's financial and monetary policies, on
the other hand, have been reversing the trend by liberalizing the financial
sector (para 2.06), which has given new momentum to the banking system.
Competition and Ltr,t volume have substantially increased since 1974, spurred
in part by the recent establishment of casas bancarias. To further encourage
competition, the government is presently preparing a proposal to permit
establishment of new banks and induce all banking institutions to serve as
multi-service banks.
2.04      Since the government started major liberalization reforms in 1975,
the banking system in Uruguay has been showing a new dynamism characterized
by a rapid growth of deposits and financial assets (averaging 10% p.a. in real
terms in 1974-79). The commercial banking system's credit to the private
sector has grown by 123% in real terms since 1974. As of December 31, 1979
the system's credit outstanding to the private sector amounted to NUr$19 billion
(US$2.2 billion), which is equivalent to 34% of GDP compared to only 18% in
1974. The private commercial banks were responsible for most of the growth,
and as a result, BROU's participation in the financing of the private sector
decreased from 54% in 1974 to 29% in 1979. The recently established casas
bancarias have also participated actively and accounted for 5% of total
private credit at the end of 1979. Table 2.1 below illustrates the chang-
ing structure of the commercial banking system over the past six years.

2.05      IFC's investment bank project.  IFC has recently approved an
investment in a new merchant banking-type institution, incorporated as a casa
bancaria (SURINVEST), mainly to help to develop underwriting and leasing
operations in the Uruguayan financial market. It will also undertake lending
operations (short and long term) mainly to the industrial sector. SURINVEST,
in which IFC holds a 20% equity participation, has an initial paid-in capital
of NUr$ 30 million. It is expected to increase the availability and number of
alternative sources of term credit to the industrial sector and increase the
scope and volume of financial instruments available to the investing public.
SURINVEST would be eligible to participate under the proposed project (para.
3.13).
B.   Monetary Policy
2.06      The monetary and credit policies of the government have been an
integral component of the economic measures taken since 1975, aiming to
open the economy and improve resource allocation and growth through elimination
of most price controls, trade liberalization and opening of the financial
system. The principal monetary and credit measures have been (a) elimination
of (i) controls of interest rates and indexation; (ii) rediscounting operations;
(iii) all BCU's subsidized credit; (iv) minimum reserve requirements; and (v)
taxes on financial operations; (b) establishment of a legal framework to allow
Uruguayan residents to hold foreign assets and perform transactions in any
foreign currencies; and (c) elimination of a dual exchange rate system under
which transactions on imports, exports and service of public foreign debt were
exchanged under a "commercial" rate and all other transactions under a
"financial" rate. These measures have made Uruguay one of the freest finan-
cial markets in Latin America and have substantially encouraged resource
mobilization, as shown by the increase in financial assets held by the non-
banking private sector, from 34% of GDP in 1974 to 44% in 1979. However,
because the opening of the financial sector occurred much faster than the
opening of the goods and services sector (trade liberalization), the resulting
increased monetary supply has exacerbated inflationary pressures (inflation
of 58% in 1977, 45% in 1978 and 83% in 1979).
2.07      One of the few major regulatory measures that have been main-
tained on the private banking system is the minimum capital requirement.
Commercial banks are required to maintain a minimum equity of NUr$ 40 million
(US$5 million equivalent) and casas bancarias NUr$ 24 million (US$3 million
equivalent) 1/. A further important requirement is that commercial banks
and casas bancarias shall maintain a debt-equity ratio below 20:1 starting
on January 1, 1981, and prior to that date below 30:1. The capital require-
ment are not expected to pose great difficulties for most commercial banks,
since their total existing equity exceeds the requirements as of January 1,
1982 in current terms, and eventual adjustments for inflation on minimum
equity requirements are not expected to pose serious difficulties. 2/
1/   The minimum equity shall be maintained as follows: (i) before July 1,
1980, not less than 40% of the total; (ii) before January 1, 1981,
not less than 60%; and (iii) on January 1, 1982, 100%.
2/   Private commercial banks have presently higher indexed assets (NUr$ 13
billion) than liabilities (NUr$ 8 billion), which protects them for
inflation.



- 17 -
For casas bancarias, however, the minimum capital requirement present a
more serious problem, because their total existing equity (NUr$ 94 million)
is presently only 26% of nominal requirements as of January 1, 1982
(NUr$ 355 million). Several casas bancarias may be unable to meet these
requirements, and would have to merge with other institutions or close busi-
ness. However, since casas bancarias presently account for only 5% of total
banking assets, their difficulties might not create a major obstacle for the
development of the financial sector.
2.08      The debt equity limitation, on the other hand, could impose some
hardship even for commercial banks, since their current debt is greater than
the maximum debt allowed on January 1, 1981 and January 1, 1982 (see Table 2.2
below). Unless commercial banks increase their equity above minimum require-
ments, they would be forced to decrease their debt liabilities, and therefore
their outstanding portfolio. Thus, the D/E requirement could impede the
development of new long-term credit operations, because commercial banks would
prefer to use their available growth capacity for short-term operations.

2.09      To encourage long-term operations by the banking system, under the
minimum capital and debt-equity limitations suitable incentives for longer
term lending operations appear necessary. Only 3% of the banking system's
portfolio las had maturities over 360 days during the past six years, and
short term operations are presently much more profitable than long-term
operations. This imbalance is likely to continue as long as the policy of
slow pre-announced devaluation is maintained (para. 1.19). In order, to
encourage long term lending operations by banking institutions, assurances
were obtained at negotiations for the maintenance of the Guarantee Fund
(para. 3.16), which enables the intermediaries to deduct amounts covered
under such Guarantee Fund from their total debt, for purposes of the estima-
tion of their debt/equity ratio. Such an exemption would tend to diminish
distortions in the maturity profile of the banking system's portfolio, by
providing the necessary marginal profit incentive to commercial banks to
increase their long-term portfolio.
2.10      Interest rates.  In Uruguay, interest rates have been positive in
real terms in the past few years, reflecting the credit supply constraints in
the past under a highly controlled financial sector. As shown in Table 2.3
below, the average real interest rate was about 4.7% in 1976, 6.6% in 1977 and
6.8% in 1978. This trend was reversed in 1979, when the average real interest
rate was -16%, mainly as a result of a higher proportion of US dollar-denominated
loans in the banking system's portfolio. In 1979, US dollar-denominated loans
earned a lower effective peso interest rate (about 44% p.a., see Table 2.3)
than peso-denominated loans (60% p.a.), due to the policy of slow devaluation
that has been followed by the government. However, inflation declined from
83% in 1979 to 50% in the first semester of 1980 (on an annual basis), while
nominal interest rates on the average have been maintained close to their
1979 levels. As a result banking system loans yielded again slightly positive
real interest rates, but still a wide gap remains between the effective cost
of dollar- and peso-denominated loans.
2.11      Due to the policy of slow devaluation with exchange rates pre-
announced by the Central Bank for several following months, banks in Uruguay
are able, without taking any foreign exchange risks, to contract short-term
foreign loans in US dollars at an interest rate of a few points above LIBOR,
which presently have an equivalent cost in local currency that is well below
inflation. In 1979, while the cost of such foreign resources was about 40% in
peso terms, they in some case were re-lent as peso-denominated loans with
interest rates of about 60% p.a., leaving a substantial spread to interme-
diaries. For this problem to be resolved, continued progress in bringing
down the rate of inflation or a faster devaluation of the peso would be
required in the medium term.

2.12      Lending spreads.  The negative real interest rates on deposits in
local currency have induced the public to increase their deposits in foreign
currency, affecting in turn the peso-dollar composition of the banking system's
lending portfolio. US dollar-denominated loans increased from about 25% of
total loans in 1977 to 52% at the end of 1979. In addition, banks have been
making short-term peso-denominated loans using resources deriving from dollar-
denominated deposits, since with the policy of pre-announced devaluations
there is little risk in this practice. This, in turn, has made banking
institutions more dependent on the relatively smaller spreads (6% average on
US dollar loans) of foreign-denominated loans and, through competition, has
forced down the spreads on the peso-denominated loans closer to the average
spread on foreign loans plus devaluation. In 1979, the spread on foreign
loans averaged 6% p.a. and on peso loans 24% p.a. (which is close to 6%
in dollars plus 20% devaluation). Competition can be expected to further
reduce the 6% spread in dollars to around 3-4% in the next 2-3 years. The
subloans envisaged under the proposed project would not carry a fixed spread
to the intermediaries. Final interest rates, and therefore spreads, would be
negotiated between the intermediaries and the subborrowers. Competition
between intermediaries is expected to result in average spreads on subloans
that are in line with those prevailing generally in the banking system (i.e.
in the range 3-4%). However, in the event that the average spread under the
project subloans exceeds 4% p.a. for an extended period, the need to establish
an adequate fixed spread for future subloans would be reviewed with the
government.
C.   Resource Mobilization
2.13      Liberalization of interest rates and currency denomination on
local transactions has enabled Uruguayan banking institutions to attract
substantial short-term foreign capital inflows in the past four years, sharply
increasing the capacity of the banking sector to finance private sector
activities. Net foreign capital inflows have increased from US$190 million
in 1976 to US$215 million in 1978 and US$386 million in 1979. As of year-end



- 20 -
1979, the BCU estimated that commercial banks held three-fourths of foreign
capital inflows in form of short-term deposits and that 22% of total deposits
in the private banking system were held by non-Uruguayan residents. Also,
local deposits have been encouraged to grow, mostly in the for'i of US dollar-
denominated deposits (para 2.10). As a result, the commercial banking
system's lending portfolio to the private sector increased its size in relation
to GDP from 17% in 1974 to 34% in 1979.
2.14     On the other hand, the  private sector has been unable, so far,
to increase its direct mobilization of resources from the private non-
banking sector, through issuance of notes or stocks. The new IFC project
(SURINVEST), however, is expected to play a major role in helping to develop
direct mobilization of resources by the private non-banking sector by carry-
ing out underwriting operations. Given the new policies of the government,
which encourage competition in the financial sector, it is expected that
issuances of notes and common stock by private enterprises can develop sub-
stantially in the near future.
D.   Financing of Industry
2.14      The industrial sector, as the rest of private sector activities,
has benefitted from the growth of the financial system in Uruguay since
1974, by increasing its total borrowing outstanding at 19% p.a. in the 1974-79
period. Such a growth in industrial borrowing has permitted higher investment
in the sector and the positive growth of industrial exports and value added
(10.1% in real terms in 1979). Despite the rapid growth of borrowing, most firms
are not highly leveraged and have additional borrowing capacity. A sample of
industrial firms reviewed by the appraisal mission 1/ showed a relatively low
average debt equity ratio of 1:1. However, about 96% of outstanding credit to
industry had maturities below 1 year as of June 1979, and it is estimated that
only a very small proportion of loans have maturities of more than 4-5
years. Nevertheless, industrial credit has a better maturity structure than
the rest of credit to the private sector, due mostly to the still modest
but useful role played by BCU through its Fondo Financiero para el Desarrollo
(FFID) (para. 3.02).
III. INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE PROPOSED PROJECT
A.   Arrangements Under the First Credit Project
3.01      Background.   The Industrial Development and Export Promotion
Project (Loan 1176-UR), which was approved in December 1975, originally had
two components: (a) US$20 million to be used for financing imported raw
materials used by Uruguayan exporting industries; and (b) US$10 million
for financing industrial export subprojects. Due to slow utilization
1/   UA in the Ministry of Industry analyzed a sample of 55 medium industrial
enterprises that had already obtained credits or were in the process of
obtaining credits. Since the sample is skewed towards higher indebted
firms, it was surprising to find that these firms were financing as much
as 51% of their new investments in 1978-79, with their internal cash flow
generation.



- 21 -
of the first component, and to the improved balance of payments position of
Uruguay, US$14,156,240 was cancelled on February 28, 1977 and the pre-
viously disbursed funds under that component (US$10.34 million equivalent)
were transferred to the subproject financing component. Of the total of
US$20.8 million subsequently available under the second com1ynent, US$18.3
million had been committed by August 15, 1980 for the financing of 30 sub-
projects, with a total investment cost of US$32 million. 1/ The net foreign
exchange impact of the subprojects financed under the loan is estimated to
amount to US$56 million, 2/ equivalent to 1.8 times the total investment costs
and to 3.1 times the Bank's resources, which would indicate that the objective
of financing efficient industrial exporting industries can be satisfactorily
achieved.
3.02      Institutional arrangements.  Under the first credit project, the BCU
established the Fondo de Financiamiento de Inversiores para el Desarrollo
(FFID) in November 1975, to channel long-term resources through the banking
system for financing private industrial projects. Initially, the resources
channeled by FFID were the US$20.8 million from the first credit project and
US$4.6 million from AID's agroindustrial loan (528-T-026). 3/ Subloans were
appraised by a staff of the Programa de Asistencia Tecnica (PAT) in the
Ministry of Industry and Energy (MIE), and subsequently reviewed and approved
by an interinstitutional committee (the Comite Coordinador, CC) with represen-
tatives of the BCU, the Ministries of Finance and Industry, and the Planning
Office. As an incentive to intermediate long-term loans, financial institu-
tions were allowed to obtain guarantees, up to 60% of FFID subloan amounts,
from a Guarantee Fund (GF) established by the BCU, also under the first
project. This two-tier credit system proved itself a viable mechanism in
Uruguay for financing efficient industrial projects.
B.   The Industrial Development Fund
3.03      Need for a new industrial development fund.  While FFID operations
have overall been successful, its organization and lack of integrated policies
have prevented it from providing a continuous flow of resources to the produc-
tive sector. Each of FFID's lines of credit has been governed by its own
regulations and relending conditions. Credit lines that were incorporated
after the Bank's first industrial credit and AID's agroindustrial loans
required institutions other than PAT to appraise subprojects with different
1/   Additionally, FFID approved 13 technical assistance subprojects totalling
US$0.23 million equivalent.
2/   The net foreign exchange impact was measured by estimating the net present
value of net foreign exchange benefits (foreign exchange revenues minus
costs) in constant prices and discounted at a 10% annual discount rate.
3/   Subsequently, other lines were incorporated into FFID:  an 1DB loan
(US$15 million) for meat packing subloans and a KfW loan (US$26.6 million
equivalent) for fisheries subloans.



- 22 -
appraisal criteria and standards. 1/ Moreover, FFID has not had
local funds to supplement its foreign credit lines and permit financing of
local costs. Now that the two most active and successful credit lines (AID's
and the Bank's first industrial loan) have been fully committed, BCU intends
to establish a new Industrial Development Fund (IDF) as a sub-fund of FFID
with new operating policies and procedures that will be common for all lines
of credit under the sul-7und, and a new revolving fund mechanism to allow
local cost financing. IDF would be used for industrial and tourism financing,
including small scale enterprises. IDF subloans would be intermediated by
participating commercial banks and casas bancarias, appraised by Unidad
Asesora, and approved by the CC.
3.04      IDF resources.  IDF resources would amount initially to US$52.20
million, as follows: (a) US$4.75 million in permanent resources originating
from the government and the BCU's original counterpart contributions of
US$2.25 million to the AID agroindustrial loan and US$2.5 million to the
Bank's first industrial credit loan; (b) US$29.45 million equivalent from
resources from the proposed project; and (c) US$18 million from the Bank of
America's credit line, 2/ recently made available by BCU for industrial lending.
The availability of funds to IDF as called for under (a) would be a condition
for loan effectiveness (para. 5.02). Loan recoveries, plus interest and fees
income, would be used to service IDF's debt, and remaining balances plus IDF
equity resources to finance local cost components of investment projects.
BCU would ensure that IDF's permanent resources value be maintained in real
terms, and protected from a possible devaluation of the Uruguayan peso.
IDF's cash resources would be maintained in convertible foreign currencies
or in securities expressed in the same currencies.
3.05      Policies and procedures.  IDF would operate in accordance with its
operating policies and procedures, which would be satisfactory to the Bank
(Annex 6). IDF resources to be channelled through participating financial
intermediaries would be used to finance: (a) fixed assets and permanent
working capital for efficient industrial and tourism projects, (b) feasibility
studies for industrial or tourism projects considered for financing under
IDF, and (c) technical and managerial consulting work to be contracted by
industrial firms to increase their productivity and efficiency. IDF loans
would be expressed either in local or foreign currency, but IDF would not
assume any foreign exchange risks. Terms of IDF subloans would be determined
taking into account the subprojects' financial needs and debt servicing
capabilities, as well as the subprojects' productive lifetime. IDF would not
charge any spread over the borrowing costs, since its administrative costs
would be covered by BCU's budget.
1/   The IDB loan for meat packing industries required subloans to be appraised
by the Instituto de Carne, and the KfW loan for fisheries by the Instituto
de Pesca.
2/   BCU contracted a US$37 million loan from a group of international banks,
syndicated by the Bank of America, of which US$18 million will be made
available for industrial financing. This loan is expected to finance
mainly foreign costs of subprojects, but in accordance with BCU's policy
could also cover local cost financing needs.



- 23 -
3.06      IDF's currency denomination  and interest rate policy.  IDF's sub-
loans would carry floating interest rates, in line with IDF's cost of resources
and market rates. Subloans expressed in US dollars would be onlent to
financial intermediaries at an interest rate equal to LIBOR 1/ plus 1% p.a.,
and carry--ig a commitment fee of 3/4 of 1% on undisbursed amounts. The
interest rate to final subborrowers will be freely negotiated between the
intermediaries and the subborrowers. Since both interest payments and princi-
pal repayments for all subloans would be made semiannually, the base LIBOR for
a semester would be estimated as the arithmetic average of rates outstanding
on the last 30 days previous to the payment date. Subloans expressed in local
currency would be subject to indexation of principal based on changes in the
price index "al por mayor" as determined by the Central Bank in its Boletin
Estadistico. Interest due by the intermediaries to IDF at the end of a
six-months period would be 0.5% p.a., and by the subborrowers at an interest
rate to be freel.- n-3gotiated between the intermediaries and the borrowers, to
be charged upon the principal outstanding at each repayment date. Principal
and repayment installments would be adjusted at the end of each period, by
using the change in the price index during the six-months period but permitting
a lag of two months to allow sufficient time for the publication of the price
index by BCU. The Bank subloans and those from IDF's own resources could be
expressed either in US dollars or in pesos, in a mix to be freely selected by
industrial borrowers, to accommodate their expectations on inflation or
devaluation.
C.   The Unidad Asesora (UA)
3.07      The export and agroindustrial subprojects financed by FFID were
required to be appraised by the PAT, a technical unit established in April
1975 in the Ministry of Industry, under the supervision of Unidad Asesora
(UA), which has been in charge of administering the Investment Promotion Law
of 1974 (para. 1.16).. In light of the important operational role placed by
the government on UA and the need to ensure a reliable and expeditious evalua-
tion and approval mechanism under the Bank's First Industrial Credit Project,
the government decided to place PAT under the direct authority of UA, which
now reports directly to the Minister, Subsecretary and General Director of the
Ministry of Industry (Annex 3, Table 3.8). The relationship between UA and
PAT, however, is presently not clear. Duplication of responsibilities between
the president of UA and the director of PAT have created frictions and adminis-
trative difficulties. At negotiations, therefore, assurances were obtained
from the government on a reorganization of UA, which will: (a) incorporate
PAT fully into UA as the projects studies area; (b) nominate one of the three
members of UA as head of the projects studies area; and (c) assign to the
President of UA the responsibility for coordinating all UA activities.
3.08      Appraisal work.  UA has progressively improved its appraisal
capability. By 1977 UA had already acquired the respect of the financial
intermediaries for the high quality of its appraisal work. Financial and
administrative aspects of sponsoring enterprises have been thoroughly treated,
and have resulted in several cases in programs to restructure or strengthen
administrative, personnel or financial management aspects of the firms.

Economic analysis, including employment and balance of payments impacts,
have had a sound treatment and provided a firm basis for resource allocation.
In addition, UA has had to provide a considerable amount of assistance
to enterprises in project formulation, to provide an adequate basis for
subsequent appraisal.
3.09       Uruguay's inflationary environment requires a much more detailed
and complex financial analysis than is normally the case. Thus, UA's
project formulation and appraisal work has proved to be very manpower inten-
sive, which has limited its processing capacity. The average subloan has
taken between 4 and 8 months for UA to appraise. To channel a larger volume
of resources and reach a larger number of enterprises, UA is planning to
delegate as much as possible of the work on promotion and project formulation
to financial intermediaries. Several intermediaries have indicated their
willingness to play a more substantial role in project promotion and formula-
tion provided that they receive an adequate spread (para. 3.14) to cover the
associated costs.
3.10       Supervision activities.  UA's project supervision activities have,
so far, consisted mainly of checking whether resources lent were actually
used for intended purposes, plus some follow-up on subborrowers whose finan-
cial situation was relatively weak. By 1978, 9 out of the 16 subborrowers
financed by the Bank loan had required this latter kind of supervision, which
still proved to be effective because of the small number of subprojects
involved. With the acceleration in the demand for Bank financing since late
1978, however, the need to more clearly define intermediaries' supervision
responsibilities and better organize UA's supervision activities became
apparent. UA has now established separate units covering promotion, appraisal
and supervision, but the supervision unit still remains weak. To strengthen
supervision under the proposed project, intermediaries would carry out a
periodic follow-up of the enterprises' financial condition. In addition,
UA's supervision manuals and guidelines would need to be revised, and its
supervision staff increased by at least one professional financial analyst.
During negotiations on the proposed project assurances were obtained from
the government that such actions would be taken prior June 30, 1981.
3.11       Personnel and salary policies.  Inadequate salary levels  have led
to high turnover of UA's professional staff. Turnover in 1975-79 averaged
annually one-fourth of total staff. 1/ Difficulties in recruiting professional
staff, particularly engineers, have also been directly related to low salary
levels. Upon recommendations of Bank supervision missions, the Ministry of
Industry reviewed salary requirements for UA's staff and decided to establish
a new salary structure starting on March 1, 1980. The new salary levels, if
maintained constant in real terms in the future, appear to be adequate and
competitive with salaries for similar positions in the Uruguayan private
1/   While average staff number in 1975-79 amounted to 11.4, annual termina-
tions averaged 2.75 (24% of 11.4 staff).



- 25 -
sector except in the case of engineers whose salaries are still about 25%
below competitive levels. 1/ The government has indicated its intention
that the salaries of UA's professional staff, including engineers, would be
maintained at adequate levels to permit attracting and maintaining reasonably
qualified and experienced staff for carrying out the tasks envisaged under the
project.
3.12      Technical assistance by UNDP/UNIDO.  Through a UJNDP technical
assistance program (URU/75/013), two experienced financial analysts, one
industrial engineer/economist, and one market analyst were financed by the
UNDP and managed by UNIDO, who have been instrumental in the development of
UA's overall technical expertise and training of local staff. Both UNDP and
UNIDO have expressed their satisfaction with the results achieved in the first
technical assistance program and have recently signed with the government a
new contract for a second program to continue providIng assistance to UA
through 1981 (Annex 4). Under the new technical assistance program (URU/78/013),
UNDP/UNIDO would provide further assistance to UA in subproject appraisal and
supervision by conducting periodic seminars for UA personnel and preparing
manuals and guidelines. UNDP/UNIDO would provide a total of 144 man-months
of expert services to UA, and the total UNDP contribution would amount to
US$493,300 over the 1980-81 period. The government's cost-sharing contribu-
tion would be an additional US$284,544, of which US$135,000 would be financed
through the technical assistance component of the proposed project to cover
foreign exchange costs (para. 4.04).
D.   Participating Intermediaries
3.13      A total of 19 intermediaries (14 commercial banks and 5 casas
bancarias) intermediated industrial subloans under FFID in 1975-79 (Annex
3, Table 3.2). The seven most active institutions accounted for 60.3% of
total loans approved, with an average participation of 8.6% for each interme-
diary and ranging between 6.7% and 12.6% for the least and most active, res-
pectively, which indicates the wide and relatively well-distributed share of
long-term lending among the various intermediaries. Banking institutions in
Uruguay have been competing actively in channeling FFID's long-term subloans,
aiming to establish long-term relations with industrial clients. Furthermore,
several banks (Panamericano, Real, Pan de Azucar and SURINVEST) are presently
interested in establishing the necessary infrastructure and administrative
mechanisms to carry out promotional activities by which they would opportunely
identify firms willing to carry out new investment projects and help them in
the formulation and implementation of such projects.
3.14      Under the proposed project, financial intermediaries would be
required to carry out promotional work and project-formulation assistance
work. The latter would consist of: (a) helping the industrial clients in
preparing adequate terms of reference for consultants, ensuring that project

of the private sector, compiled by Price-Waterhouse for the government
and reported in March 1979.



- 26 -
formulation will be adjusted to UA's guidelines; and (b) follow-up of consul-
tants' work during formulation, including review of interim reports to verify
coverage and adequacy of treatment of the project's most critical aspects; and
(c) reception from the consultants of adequate formulation work that satisfac-
torily analyzes the technical, financial and economic aspects of the subprojects.
3.15      Financial intermediaries would be required to sign Participation
Agreements with BCU that establish their responsibilities for intermediating
IDF resources. The contents of such agreements were agreed upon during
loan negotiations, and the signing of agreements with at least two inter-
mediaries will be required for effectiveness. Intermediaries would be
required by the participation agreement to: (i) observe all the IDF's poli-
cies and regulations; (ii) promote financing by IDF; (iii) give their approval
in principle, subject to approval by the Coordinating Committee, to the
subprojects and subloans before their submission to UA; (iv) ensure that the
financial resources proposed to finance the subprojects are sufficient to meet
the actual requirements of those subprojects, including contingencies; (v)
supervise the correct use of the funds by the subborrower and the general
functioning of the beneficiary company, without prejudice to supervision by UA
or BCU; (vi) issue periodic reports on the progress of the subprojects financed,
noting any irregularity detected; (vii) keep proper records of the subloans
financed out of IDF resources; (viii) comply with all reasonable requests for
information from IDF; (ix) comply with IDF's terms of financing and repayment
on each subloan, even if the final borrowers have not met their financial
obligations to the intermediary when due; (x) pay into IDF immediately all
advance payments received from the subborrowers; and (xi) provide guidance
to the customers in preparing and monitoring pre-investment studies needed for
subproject preparation and liaison and coordination with UA in the formulation,
processing and monitoring of the subprojects.
E.   The Guarantee Fund
3.16      Under the Bank's first project, the BCU also established a Guarantee
Fund (GF) that, for a one-time 2.5% fee, covered 65% of the subloan amounts
to the participating intermediaries in case of default by final borrowers.
In the five-years period 1975-79, only one subloan defaulted under the system.
The GF played a useful role in inducing intermediaries to become involved for
the first time in long-term operations, without excessively increasing their
collateral requirements to subborrowers. It was a prerequisite of the GF
that collateral value would not exceed 200% of the original subloan amounts.
In 1979, the BCU broadened the GF to cover any intermediary's loan with terms
above 2 years, and in addition increased the coverage percentage from 65% to
75%. As a result, the GF has received many requests for all types of loans,
mainly mortgage loans by the Mortgage Bank. While the risk for the GF could
have been increased since FFID's requirement that loans be appraised was
eliminated, on the other hand, risks to the GF have been diversified by
increasing the number of covered loans and by allowing different types of
loans to be covered. During the preparation and appraisal of the proposed
project, the need for maintaining the GF was thoroughly analyzed with the
BCU, which finally concluded that it should be maintained, to continue its
role for inducing financial intermediaries to engage in long-term operations.
Thus, assurances were obtained from the government that the GF will be
maintained at least during the disbursement period of the proposed loan,
including the feature that portions of the loans that are guaranteed by the GF
will be excluded by BCU in the calculation of the debt/equity ratio of banks
and casas bancarias (para. 2.09).

IV. THE PROJECT
A.   Objectives of the Proposed Project
4.01      AL main objectives of the proposed project would be to: (a) finance
efficient productive industrial, agro-industrial and tourism project invest-
ments, within the framework of Uruguay's import liberalization policies, to
improve the international competitiveness of Uruguayan industrial and tourism
enterprises; (b) help to establish project promotion and formulation capacity
within participating private intermediary banks, thereby increasing the
ability of the banking system to provide medium- and long-term financing based
upon proper industrial project analysis; (c) provide resources to the government
for technical assistance to the Ministry of Industry's Unidad Asesora (UA)--
the main appraisal unit under the proposed project--as a cost-sharing contri-
bution to the UTJ"7-.iinanced technical assistance project (URU/78/013); and (d) -
provide technical assistance financing to hire consultants for industrial
borrowers to improve their production, technology, and managerial efficiency. 1/
B.   Project and Loan Description
4.02      The proposed loan for a total of US$30 million equivalent would have
two components: (a) a US$29.45 million credit component; and (b) US$0.55
million for financing technical assistance to the government. The loan would
be made to the Republic of Uruguay and would be repaid on the basis of a
fixed 12-years amortization schedule, which is expected to conform substantially
to the aggregate of the amortization schedules of the subloans made out of the
proceeds of the loan. Resources of the credit component would be passed on
by the government to BCU's Industrial Development Fund (IDF) for onlending
through commercial banks and casas bancarias to efficient industrial and
tourism projects. The government would cover the full foreign exchange risk
between currencies involved in the Bank loan (currency pooling system) and the
currencies in which subloans would be expressed (US dollars or pesos). Under
the proposed project, BCU would establish the IDF (paras. 3.03-3.06), UA would
continue strengthening its organizational structure and project appraisal and
supervision capabilities (paras. 3.08-3.11) and financial intermediaries would
be required to participate actively in project promotion and formulation
(para. 3.14-3.15). Since one of the major objectives of the project would be
to support the successful implementation of the government's tariff reduction
program (paras. 1.25 and 1.30), assurances from the government were obtained
1/   This effort would complement Loan 1594-UR (US$9.7 million), approved in
1978, which is designed to provide vocational training to industrial
workers and assistance for technological research and development and the
work being done by the Centro Nacional de Tecnologica y Productividad
Industrial (CNTPI), which, through a UNDP-financed project, is providing
technical assistance at a diagnostic level to industrial enterprises in a
limited number of subsectors.



- 28 -
at negotiations that the Bank will have the right not to approve further
subloans in the event of that consolidated tariff reduction targets (para.
1.25) specified in the December 1978 decree had not been satisfactorily
achieved, or if measures adversely affecting the achievement of the objec-
tives of the December 1978 decree, apart from exchange rate movements, had
been introduced (para. 4.12).
4.03      Under the project, there would be three types of subloans for
industrial and tourism enterprises: (a) project investment financing, up to
US$4 million of cumulative Bank lending per borrowing enterprise, with maturi-
ties up to 10 years, including a grace period of up to 3 years; (b) technical
and management consulting financing, up to US$80,000 equivalent per borrowing
enterprise, with maturities between 3 and 5 years, including a grace period of
up to 1 year; and (c) preinvestment financing, up to US$80,000 equivalent per
borrowing enterprise with maturities between 3 and 5 years, including a grace
period of up to 1 year. All subloans would be appraised by UA and approved
by the CC. In addition, all subloans above US$500,000 equivalent (the new
free limit under the project, compared to US$200,000 under the first project)
would need to be approved by the Bank. This would amount to about 30 sub-
projects covering about two-thirds of the loan amount. The new free limit of
US$500,000 is justified as a result of UA's satisfactory performance under
the first credit project.
4.04    The proposed project's technical assistance component of US$550,000
would provide US$350,000 to finance: (a) about US$100,000 for UA to hire
experienced consultants in project promotion and analysis to: (i) prepare
material for use of Participating Banks in formuating projects and for the
training of Participating Banks in project formulation as required under this
Project; (ii) help to carry out a training program for the staff of UA and
(iii) work closely with participating intermediaries to assist industrial
clients in the formulation of subprojects; (b) about US$95,000 for UA to hire
short-term consultants for sectoral and market analyses, procurement matters
and technical analysis for specific subprojects as necessary; (c) about
US$135,000 to cover part of the government's counterpart contribution for 1981
to the UNDP Industrial Investment Promotion Project (URU/78/013); (d) about
US$20,000 for foreign travel expenditures related to training of UA staff,
including visits to DFCs in other Latin American countries, in accordance with
a program to be agreed by June 30, 1981. The remaining US$200,000 of the
technical assistance component would be used to finance consultants to be
hired to conduct a study of trade liberalization progress (para. 4.12).
C.   Project Cost and Financing
4.05      A strong demand for industrial financing is expected during the next
2-3 years (Annex 8), mainly for plant modernization, improvements in product
quality and productivity. Financial intermediaries would finance up to 80% of
total investment costs, including foreign exchange costs, while borrowers are
expected to finance the remaining 20% with their own funds. Financial interme-
diaries could refinance up to 100% of their financing for individual subprojects
with the IDF. Table 4.1 below shows the expected total project cost and
financing plan.

/a   It is assumed that the foreign cost component of new investment costs
would stay in the range observed under the first credit project, with
an average of 70% over total investment costs. The 30% local cost
component would then be financed by the project sponsors (20%), by BCU's
initial contribution to IDF (7.2%) and by the Bank of America's loan (the
remaining 2.8% equivalent to US$1.84 million).
D.   Terms and Conditions of Subloans
4.06      Interest rates.  Subloans under the proposed project would be subject
to IDF's interest rate policy (para. 3.06).  However, starting on July 31, 1981
there would be annual reviews by the Bank and the government on the adequacy
of IDF's interest rate policy for new subprojects, taking into account trends
in domestic and international inflation and in Uruguay's overall interest
rate structure (para. 5.01).  As agreed between the government and the Bank,
the frequency of such reviews could be adjusted.
4.07      The government would pay the Bank's commitment fee and absorb the
foreign exchange risks between the various currencies involved in the Bank
loan and the US dollar or the peso subloans. Bank resources would be passed
on by the government to IDF, and in turn to financial intermediaries in two
different ways: (a) in US dollars, in case of subloans expressed in that
currency, at a floating interest rate equal to LIBOR 1/ plus 1%; and (b) in
1/   As defined in para. 3.06.



- 30 -
pesos, in case of subloans expressed in domestic currency, subject to indexa-
tion of principal based on domestic inflation 1/ with a 0.5% interest rate.
In both cases, in addition, a commitment fee of 0.75% on undisbursed amounts
would be charged to the intermediaries and passed on to the government.
4.08      Final interest rates to subborrowers would be freely negotiated
between intermediaries and the subborrowers, to ensure market rates as well
as adequate spreads for intermediaries (para. 3.06).
4.09      Procurement.  The proceeds of the Bank loan would finance the foreign
exchange costs of imported and locally procured equipment and materials, and
the full cost of consulting studies, whether the consulting contract is awarded
to foreign or local consultants. Participating intermediaries would satisfy
themselves that procurement items are suitable for the respective investment
projects and are reasonably priced, and that the beneficiaries had canvassed
the main sources of supply and are purchasing from the most advantageous
source. Whenever justified, items would be procured on the basis of at least
three different quotations, and in accordance with standard practices for
IDF-type projects. Since it may be difficult or too costly to obtain quota-
tions from several suppliers in case of small orders, the solicitation of
offers would be expected mostly for items that individually exceed a cost of
US$100,000 equivalent. UA would be required to review the adequacy of the
procurement process. For the financing of the technical assistance component,
loan proceeds would cover the full cost of consulting studies and the cost-
sharing contribution of the government to the UNDP project for financing
foreign costs.
4.10      Disbursements.  The final date for the submission of subproject pro-
posals to the Bank would be June 30, 1984 and the closing date for disbursement
December 31, 1985. Bank funds, subject to the ceilings indicated in para.
4.03, would be disbursed on the following basis: (a) 100% of CIF costs of
costs of imported equipment, machinery and permanent working capital (per-
manent inventories of raw materials and parts, associated with increases
in production); (b) 100% of the CIF costs of imported equipment, machinery,
and permanent working capital sold over-the-counter in the local market (to
be estimated by UA on a case-by-case basis); (c) 40% of the ex-factory price
of locally manufactured machinery, equipment and of industrial and hotel
civil works 2/ and (d) 100% of consulting services. Since a two-tier system
(involving IDF and the financial intermediaries) requires more time for proces-
sing subprojects than is normally used by one-tier systems, disbursements would
be made for expenditures incurred up to 180 days prior to receipt by the Bank
of subloan request, in lieu of the normal 90 days limit. All disbursements
requests would be fully documented, including payments to the UNDP project
under the technical assistance component.
1/   In the event that price controls should be reinstated, however, the
government has represented that it would withhold applications for
new commitments of peso-denominated subloans until a suitable agreement
is reached on substitute arrangements for indexation of such subloans.
2/   40% is a conservative estimate of the foreign exchange component of
locally manufactured equipment and of civil works, based on previous
Bank projects in Uruguay.



- 31 -
E.   Accounts and Audits
4.11      Under the proposed credit project, BCU would establish and maintain
separate accounts for IDF operations in a form satisfactory to the Bank.
Under the first project, FFID's accounts were audited by the government's
Tribunal de Cuentas. Such audits did not fully satisfy the Bank's require-
ments. During negotiations on the proposed loan, agreement was reached to
have IDF accounts audited annually by independent auditors satisfactory to the
Bank. The audit reports, with a scope satisfactory to the Bank, would be sub-
mitted to the Bank not later than 6 months after the close of each fiscal year.
F.   Study of the Trade Liberalization in Uruguay
4.12      Approval of subprojects and authorization of withdrawals from the
loan account will be subject to satisfactory achievement of the consolidated
tariff reduction targets specified in the December 1978 decree (para. 1.21)
and to the government having not introduced any other measures (e.g. additional
protection through non-tariff trade barriers) that would hinder achievement of
the trade liberalization objectives implicit in the decree. 1/ To establish
whether the targets established in the December 1978 decree had been achieved,
a study would be carried out by consultants satisfactory to the Bank, hired by
the Ministry of Economy and Finance under terms of reference also satisfactory
to the Bank. Such a study would be financed under the proposed loan (para.
4.04) and would be completed not later than March 31, 1982. It would include:
(a) levels of nominal, effective protection and net effective protection
(including the combined exchange rate and inflation impact on effective
protection); and (b) identification of additional protection, if any, due to
use of reference prices different from actual CIF prices or to other non-tariff
trade barriers that may have been imposed. Upon a joint review by the govern-
ment and the Bank to be completed not later than June 30, 1982, it would be
determined whether targets had been satisfactorily achieved. If this were
found not to be the case, and the situation could not be expected to be
remedied within a reasonable period satisfactory to the Bank, no further
subprojects would be approved. In addition to the objective of establishing
whether trade liberalization targets had been achieved, the study would assess
the impact of the government's policies on industrial (a) production levels;
(b) investment; (c) exports growth; (d) employment; and (e) profitability.
The consultants to carry out the study would be hired prior to loan effective-
ness (para. 5.02).
G.   Project Benefits and Risks
4.13      The proposed project is expected to have a significant developmental
impact. It would contribute to improvements in the Uruguayan economic policy
framework by supporting the government's Tariff Reduction Program and providing
a data base for the formulation of subsequent trade liberalization measures.
In addition, the project would build on the institutional developments ini-
tiated under the first Industrial Credit Project by: (i) further strengthening
UA's appraisal and supervision capabilities; (ii) helping to establish a
new industrial financing fund (the IDF) in the Central Bank, with appropriate
1/   In this regard the possible impact of exchange rate movements on levels
of protection would not be taken into account.



- 32 -
financial measures and suitable operating policies and procedures; and (iii)
encouraging and assisting interested financial intermediaries to become more
heavily involved in project promotion and formulation and to increase their
industrial long-term lending activities on the basis of project analysis
rather than collateral security.
4.14      The proposed project would help to fill a gap in the availability of
long-term resources for financing efficient industrial and tourism projects
in Uruguay. While it is difficult to predict accurately the number and size
of subprojects likely to be financed, experience of FFID during 1975-79 and
UA's present project pipeline suggest that about 65-80 investment subprojects
would be financed for a total cost of about US$66 million. On a similar
basis, direct employment generated through the project is expected to be
about 3,200 jobs at an average cost per job of about $20,000. Moreover, a
significant indirect employment generation effect can be expected through
backward linkages in the agricultural and tourism sectors and through the
preservation of employment in firms making investments to upgrade their
production efficiency and international competitiveness. The balance of
payments impact may also be substantial, since a significant proportion of
beneficiary firms are expected to be exporters. In line with previous experi-
ence under FFID, the economic rate of return for most subprojects is likely to
exceed 20%.
4.15      The proposed project, as conceived, does not involve any unusual
risks. However, some initial delays in loan utilization may occur because
(i) uncertainty does exist about the impact of the current foreign exchange
policies on industrial profitability and investment behavior; and (ii) some
of the institutional arrangements established under the project would be new

URUGUAY: APPRAISAL OF A SECOND INDUSTRIAL CREDIT PROJECT
UNDP ASSISTANCE TO UNIDAD ASESORA (UA)
To help the Unidad Asesora (UA) overcome its initial deficiencies
in project supervision and financial, marketing and economic analyses of
subprojects, the professional staff of UA was complemented by foreign
experts in these areas provided under the UNDP project URU/72/013
"Organizacion Institucional de Servicios Industriales" approved in March
1975. As a result of this assistance, UA improved substantially its
technical capabilities within a relatively short period. By 1976-1977
UA had acquired the respect of the financial intermediaries for the high
quality of its appraisal work.
Specifically, the first UNDP project provided:
(a) assistance to UA in appraisal of projects for determining
eligibility under the Industrial Promotion Law;
(b) assistance to entrepreneurs in the identification of
possible investment projects and preparation of studies
identifying specific investment opportunities available in
the country;
(c) training programs and seminars to entrepreneurs and
financial institutions to inform them on the fiscal incentives
and financial resources available for industrial projects and
processing requirements;
(d) assistance in the completion of UA's operating procedure
manual for appraisal and supervision of projects;
(e) assistance to UA in the streamlining of appraisal and
supervision of projects, through preparation of checklists
for technical, financial and marketing analyses of projects.

Page 2
UNDP provided a total of 218 man-months of expert services with
a total UNDP contribution of US$932,500 over the 1974-79 period.
An evaluation of the UNDP/URU/72/013 project conducted in May 1979,
to access the impact of the project and to identify the existing problem
areas within UA and present possible solutions, concluded that while
progress in the technical and economic evaluation of subprojects had been
substantial and the capacity of UA in this respect had reached a point
where it was highly regarded among participating enterprises and commercial
banks, lengthy administrative procedures related to the granting of fiscal
incentives under the Industrial Promotion Law to subprojects approved for
financing preclude a fluid operation of this credit mechanism. In addition,
the UNDP evaluation team concluded that the high turnover of UA staff,
resulting from salary levels which were below those of the private sector
(which competed with UA for professional staff) had been a detrimental
factor in meeting the goals of the UNDP first project. Since the time this
review took place some positive steps have been taken.
UNDP has agreed to extend the technical assistance provided to UA
under its previous project through 1981. The new UNDP/UNIDO project is
designed to further improve UA's promotion, appraisal and supervision of
subprojects. UNDP/UNIDO would provide: (a) training programs and seminars
to entrepreneurs and representatives of financial intermediaries to inform
them on the fiscal incentives and financial resources available for industrial
project and the processing requirements and preparation of at least two
subsector studies per year; (b) assistance to entrepreneurs in the identifi-
cation of possible industrial projects; (c) assistance to UA in the appraisal

of subprojects presented by industrial concerns for financing under the
Industrial Development Fund by conducting periodic seminars for UA's
personnel on project appraisal and improving the existing appraisal
criteria guidelines and regulations, including developing more streamlined
appraisal criteria for the smallest investment projects; (d) assistance to
UA by conducting periodic seminars for UA's staff on project supervision
and preparation of manuals and guidelines to be used by UA staff for
supervision; and (e) financing for trips abroad for UA personnel to visit
development banks in other Latin American countries to study their
appraisal and supervision systems. UNDP/UNIDO would provide a total of
144 man-months of expert services to UA and the total UNDP contribution
would amount to US$493,300 over the 1980-1981 period. The Government's
cost sharing contribution would be an additional US$284,544 which would
be financed through the technical assistance component of the proposed
project (para. 3.12). A detailed breakdown of costs of the project is
shown on page 4 of this Annex.

SECOND INDUSTRIAL CREDIT PROJECT
INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT SUE-FUND
Policies and Operating Procedure
1.        Objectives.  The objectives of the Industrial Development Sub-
Fuad (the Sub-Fund), set up within Fondo de Financiamiento de Inversiones
para el Desarrollo (FFID, established by Banco Central del Uruguay's
Circular 1031), are: (a) to assist in the country's socioeconomic develop-
ment, providing medium- and long-term financing for development projects
of efficiently-run private production companies in the industrial, agro-
Industrial and tourism sectors; (b) to promote development of the system
of medium- and long-term financing for efficient investment projects. To
achieve its purpose, the Sub-Fund is set up for an indefinite duration;
its financial resources shall be non-transferable and separate from all
other resources of the FFID.
2.        Resources.  The Sub-Fund shall have the following resources:
(a) contributions from the government and the Central Bank in an amount
equivalent to US$4.75 million, in connection with loans AID-528-T-026
(US$2.25 million equivalent) and IBRD-1176-UR (US$2.5 million equivalent);
(b) funds provided by (i) the above-mentioned loans, (ii) Bank of America
loans (US$18 million) and a possible second industrial credit loan from
the World Bank (for an amount equivalent to US$29.45 million), (iii) re-
sources of other loans that BCU may decide to assign to the Sub-Fund;
(c) any surpluses obtained by the Sub-Fund on its operations; and (d)
recoveries of the Sub-Fund's own loans. These recoveries shall be placed



ANNEX 6
Page 2
- 72 -
in a joint account, which, following deduction of the corresponding princi-
pal and interest and commission payments, shall be used to grant financing
as provided in this document, to serve as a counterpart to credit obtained,
or to finance local costs.
3.        The Sub-Fund's liquid resources shall be in the form such as to
maintain the true value of those resources by protecting them against infla-
tion and devaluation.
4.        Beneficiaries of Sub-Fund Financing.  The Sub-Fund's resources
shall be used to assist industrial, agroindustrial and tourism companies
with the financing of (a) fixed assets and permanent working capital; and
(b) the services of technical, pre-investment and management consultants.
In no case shall the Sub-Fund finance taxes or other fiscal charges,
interest or commission on loans, Guarantee Fund commission, existing debts,
or public-sector investment projects.
5.        Operating Procedure.  The Sub-Fund's resources shall be lent
solely through financial intermediaries, such as commercial banks and
banking houses, for technically, economically and financially viable
projects appraised by the Unidad Asesora of the Mfinistry of Industry and
Energy in accordance with Unidad Asesora's evaluation guidelines, and
approved by the Coordinating Committee (Decree 839/975). In the same way,
projects financed with Sub-Fund resources shall be properly supervised in
accordance with Unidad Asesora's supervision guidelines.
6.        Conditions of participation and obligations of the financial
intermediaries. All commercial banks and banking houses operating in the



ANNEX 6
Page 3
- 73 -
country may act as financial intermediaries (IFs) for Sub-Fund resources.
The IFs shall be required to sign a contract with BCU, undertaking, inter
alia, to: (i) observe all the Sub-Fund's policies and regulations; (ii)
promote financing by the Sub-Fund; (iii) approve in principle, subject to
approval by the Coordinating Committee, the subprojects and subloans be-
fore their submission to Unidad Asesora; (iv) ensure that the financial
resources proposed to finance the subprojects are sufficient to meet the
actual requirements of those subprojects, including contingencies; (v)
assist Unidad Asesora in supervising the correct use of the funds by the
subborrower and the general functioning of the beneficiary company, by
issuing periodic reports on the progress of the subprojects financed,
noting any irregularity detected; (vi) comply with all reasonable requests
for information from the Sub-Fund; (vii) provide guidance to the customers
in preparing the pre-investment studies needed for the subprojects (using
the companies' own staff or qualified private consultants), and suitable
assistance and monitoring in connection with subproject formulation; and
(viii) provide liaison and coordination with Unidad Asesora in the formula-
tion, processing and monitoring of the subprojects.
Financial policies
7.        Financing provided by the Sub-Fund may be denominated in Uruguayan
or foreign currency, but the Sub-Fund shall in no case bear any exchange
risk in connection with the resources it obtains.
8.        In no case shall the Sub-Fund transfer to the BCU any dividends
or earnings resulting from its operations.



ANNEX 6
Page 4
- 74 -
9.        The Sub-Fund and the financial intermediaries shall lend at
interest rates that will satisfactorily ensure efficient allocation of
resources, in line wiC.h the cost of resources and market rates, and
protecting the value of the Sub-Fund resources from inflation or devalua-
tion. Their lending rates must reflect the costs of the different types
of resources or credit lines channeled through the Sub-Fund. The interest
differential allowed to the financial intermediaries shall reflect not only
the costs and risks involved in the financing, but also the need to pro-
vide suitable profitability to the intermediaries for their participation
in the medium- and long-term financing of efficient investment projects.
Sub-Fund Administration
10.       Administration of the Sub-Fund shall be the responsibility of
BCU, which shall assign the necessary personnel for the efficient operation
of the Sub-Fund, make arrangements for the training of said personnel and,
whenever necessary, set up study groups to analyze aspects of the Sub-
Fund's operations.
11.       As administrator of the Sub-Fund, BCU shall:
(a) administer its financial resources;
(b) determine the terms and conditions of the resources to be
lent by the Sub-Fund, either directly or from external sources;
(c) sign loan agreements with the financial intermediaries;
(d) establish a reporting system to cover the Sub-Fund's opera-
tions, the subprojects and the participating financial insti-
tutions, to enable it to appraise the results in the light
of the Sub-Fund's established objectives, and, should it so
deem necessary, propose any necessary changes;

SECOND INDUSTRIAL CREDIT PROJECT
Loan and Project Summary
BORROWER           :  Republica Oriental del Uruguay
BENEFICIARIES          Government would pass on the Bank Loan proceeds cor-
responding to the credit component (US$29,450,000) to
the Central Bank's Industrial Development Subfund (IDF)
for on-lending through commercial banks and casas ban-
carias for efficient industrial and tourism projects.
Through the technical assistance component, the Govern-
ment would be provided with consulting services
(US$550,000).
AMOUNT             .  U$30 million equivalent.
TERMS              :  Repayable at a fixed 12 year amortization schedule which
is expected to conform substantially to the composite
repayment of investment credit subloans, at 9.25% per
annum.
RELENDING TERMS   :   In respect of the credit component, Government would
absorb the foreign exchange risk between the various
currencies and the US dollar or the local currency,
depending whether sub-loans are expressed in US dollars
or pesos as well as the risks associated with any
decline of LIBOR below the Bank rate, and would make
available the funds through the IDF in the Central
Bank to financial intermediaries in two different ways:
(a) in US dollars at a floating interest rate equal to
LIBOR plus 1% and (b) in pesos subject to indexation
of principal based on domestic inflation with a 0.5%
interest rate. In all cases, an 0.75% commitment fee
on undisbursed amounts would be charged by IDF to the
interme.diaries. Final interest rates to sub-borrowers
would be freely negotiated between intermediaries and
the subborrowers to ensure market rates as well as
adequate spreads to intermediaries.
PROJECT OBJECTIVES:   The main objectives of the project would be to:
(a) finance productive industrial, agroindustrial and
tourism investments within the framework of Uruguay's
import liberalization policies to improve the inter-
national competitiveness of Uruguayan industrial and
tourism enterprises; (b) help establish project pro-
motion and formulation capacity within participating
private intermediary banks; and (c) provide technical
assistance to the main appraisal unit under the proposed
project (UA) and to industrial borrowers to improve
their production, technology, and managerial efficiency.



ANNEX 7
Page 2 of 2

BENEFITS               The project would help the country improve the inter-
mational competitiveness of its industrial and tourism
enterprise within the framework of its impact liberali-
zation policies. The project is expectdl to have a
significant development impact through industrial growth,
foreign exchange earnings and savings, employment genera-
tion and institutional improvements. About 65-80 sub-
projects would be financed for a total cost of US$66
million equivalent, and direct employment generation
could exceed 3,200 jobs with an average cost per job of
US$20,000.
RISKS              :  The project does not involve unusual risks.  However,
some uncertainty exists about the effects of current
foreign exchange policies on industrial profitability
and investment behavior. This and the new and untried
institutional arrangements, might cause delays in the
commitment period stage of the project.
