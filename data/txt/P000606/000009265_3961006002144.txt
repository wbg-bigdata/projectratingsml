NMEMOA UM AND RECOMMENDATION OF TLE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIOONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE ISLAMIC FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF TIE COMOROS
FOR A SMALL ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development Credit to the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros of SDR 3.7 million (JS$5.1 million),
on standard IDA terms, repayable in 40 years, to help finance a small enterprise development projet.
Part of the Credit proceeds (equivalent to US$2.5 million) would be onlent to banks at variable interest
rates reflecting the cost of funds in the Comoros.
2.    Country BaJigroun. The Comoros is an archipelago of diree islands, inhabited by a population
of about 510,000, with GNP per capita of US$510 in 1992. This income level has been achieved through
heavy reliance on external assistance (US$115 per capita annually), equivalent to about 70 percent of
imports. The country is predominantly rural: agriculture accounts for 40 percent of GDP and employs
70-80 percent of the work force. The private sector in the Comoros is not well developed in industry,
trade or services. All but a handful of firms are small-scale enterprises (SSEs) employing at most 50
people and often less than 20. Market concentration tends to be high, even in trade, where 12 firms
account for the bulk of imports. Comorian exports consist of three commodities (vanilla, cloves and
perfume essence), and covered about 40 percent of imports betweern 1988 and 1992. Following
independence in 1975, the economy grew at an annual per capita rate of about 3 percent. However, this
growth was fueled by uneconomic public investments and could not be sustained. Duriag 1986-92, GDP
per capita declined by an annual average of 2 percent, and the overall budget deficit to GDP (excluding
grants) and debt service ratios averaged about 22 percent and 24 percent, respectively. In 1993, the
overall budget deficit declined to about 12 percent, thanks to cuts in the wage bill.
3.    This poor economic performance can be attributed to a mixture of structural and policy problems:
(i) high production costs linked to the overvaluation of the Comorian Franc; (ii) declining terms of trade;
(iii) human resource constraints, despite high unskilled labor unemployment; (iv) weak macroeconomic
management; and (v) an inadequate private sector framework. In 1991, the Government, supported by
an IDA Credit (MERCAP) and an IMF SAF, launched a structural adjustment program, aimed at
counteracting the overvaluation problem and reestablishing sustainable internal and external balance
through measures designed to improve productivity and decrease costs. Measures under the program
include the compression of current public expenditures, civil service reform, privatization and liquidation
of some public enterprises, trade and price liberalization, and simplification of regulatory requirements
for businesses. On January 12, 1994, the Comorian Franc was devalued from 50 to 75 per French
Franc. This action and a continuation of ongoing measures to keep inflationary pressures under check
should contribute to greater employment and income growth and sustainable development.
4.    These actions indicate Government's commitment to the adjustment program despite a volatile
political situation. The adoption of a new constitution and subsequent multi-party elections have been
accompanied by political turmoil and frequent cabinet reshuffling, not unusual in a young democracy.
The latest multi-party legislative elections, held in December 1993, produced a working majority for the
Government in the Federal Assembly. The Government has determined that to foster a sustainable supply
response sectoral and microeconomic constraints facing the private sector also need to be addressed, and
intends to pay particular attention to the development of the small-scale enterprise (SSE) secor, which
is expected to be the main source of future employment, investment and growth.



5.     Project Obiectivg&. The Government's development strategy, supported by the Bank, calls for
accelerated export led growth, and a business environment where the private sector provides the main
impetus for investment and growth, creates employment opportunities and helps alleviate poverty. 'The
sector strategv calls for going beyond re-establishing sustainable internal and external balance and
providing a boost to competitiveness through broad measures such as the recent devaluation, ard as
reflected in the second PFP distributed to the Board in March 1994. The Government woald like to take
specific measures to create a business environment conducive to the development of all private sector
enterprises, while catering particularly to the needs of small scale enterprises. The project objective is
to help the Government implement this strategy by providing a nascent private sector with the means and
incentives to engage in productive investments. Specifically, the project will provide fiancing and
technical support to small-scale entrepreneurs and help implement improvements in cormmercial and labor
laws as well as legal and judicial procedures, while strengthening investment incentives.
6.     Project Description and Cost. To achieve the above objectives, the project would consist of
four mutually reinforcing components: (a) a line of credit which will provide the term resources needed
to finance medium- and long-term investment; (b) an enterprise development fund to help entrepreneurs
improve the design of their projects and strengthen their managerial capacity; (c) training and mstitutional
support to the Ministry of Justice to strengthen its capabilities to design and implement legal and judicial
reforms aimed at improving the legal system; and (d) training and institutional support to the Ministry
of Finance to undertake studies to design reforms aimed at improving the business environment, and to
oversee project implementation. The main features of the project are summarized as follows:
o      SupnortinLy SSE Investment: Credit Component - The project includes a line of credit of US$2.5
million which will finance individual subloans up to US$200,000 for financially profitable and
environmentally sound private investments through participating financial intermediaries (PFIs).
All private investments in productive and service sectors (including permanent working capital
for activities other than commerce) will be eligible. It is expected that the majority of financing
would be for small scale enterprises (SSEs), some of which would be new, others already
existing, and others graduating from the informal sector. The foreign exchange risk will be
borne by the Government (which will be compensated by the margin between the onlending rate
to banks and the IDA rate). The commercial risk will be borne by PFIs. Other than the Central
Bank, there are only two banks in the Comoros (the development bank, BDC, and a private
commercial bank, BIC). Both banks were assessed as per OD 8.30 during project preparation
and were found to be financially sound, and readily meet the Bank's eligibility criteria as PFIs,
even when the impact of the recent devaluation is taken into account (the impact of the
devaluation on BIC is likely to be positive and on BDC relatively minor). In addition, BDC has
prepared a business plan which will improve its efficiency and ensure that its institutional culture
is adapted for SSE lending. Managers of both banks indicated their strong interest to participate
as intermediaries in the line of credit. In the interest of simplicity and tc avoid needless
management costs associated with the creation of 'apex' institutions, the line of credit will be
made directly available to these two banks on a first-come first-served basis. Subloans would
have a maturity of up to 15 years. Interest rates (six and a half percent p.a. for 12 month
deposits and an average of about 12 percent p.a. for lending) are already positive in real terms
(annual inflation has been less than 2 percent during the past four years). The Government wIll
pass on resources to the PFIs at rates that reflect the cost of funds, which will be revised
periodically (presently about six and a half percent p.a.). As per the PFP agreements, a single
ceiling of 12.5 percent p.a. will apply for medium- and long-term lending rates, with no setoral
distinctions. As at present, banks will be free to charge different rates for different subprojects



depending on their perception of risk. The authorities believe that maintaining a ceiling on the
maximum interest rate is juEtified for the tune being by the lack of competition. The maximum
rate will be periodically revised to ensure that lending rates are always positive in real terms.
Following the recent devaluation, higher inflation is expected in 1994, but this rate should
u,ecrease to less than 5 percent in 1995. To promote the private construction sector, a small part
of the line of credit would be available to the banks to finance construction of housing, some of
which might be used for cottage industries (micro-entrepreneurs operating at home) by owners
or for rental (eligible housing would be relatively modest constructions with living areas of at
most 130 sq.m., for which eligible subloans would not exceed US$9,000). However, to favor
financing of productive investments by PFIs, only after four dollars of commitments for such
subprojects would up to one dollar be allowed for housing. The exception to this rule will be
at the start of the project, when banks will be al'owed to commit up to US$50,000 for housing
without corresponding commitmenLts in other sectors.
Encouraging Entrepreneurship:  Entergrisg Development Fund (EDF2 - The Credit would
contribute US$850000 to an enterprise development fund, which would provide specialized
training and assistance programs to SSEs and financial institutions. These programs would be
conceived to enhance SSE management and productivity and would complement other donor
initiatives. The Ceater for Assistance to the Private Sector (CASP), a private sector agency, or
another institution acceptable to IDA, would manage the EDF and execute the first two of the
following three sub-components (the last would be managed by the Ministry of Finance): (i) about
10 specialized short-term interventions (about one month each) by experts who would provide
advice to groups of about 10 entrepreneurs with similar problems; to minimize costs while
ensuring quality advice, the experts will be selected among the pool of international volunteers
(retirees); (ii) about 50 man-months of assistance by an engineer and a financial analyst, including
also 6 man-months for the CASP's principal technical advisor; and (iii) training for banks in
medium- and long-term lending, with special emphasis on how to be more resoonsive to the needs
of SSEs and evaluate their risk, and on the assessment of environmental impact of subprojects,
thus strengthening the execution of the line of credit component. The assistance to the private
sector would be usually provided on a cost sharing basis: EDF would pay for about 70 percent
of costs for short-term experts described in (i); and entrepreneurs would be charged a daily fee
of around US$25 to consuit the engineer. Tne rules for interventions by IDA expert are spelled
out in a Procedure Manual.
o      Improving Business Laws and Their Application: Legal Reforms and Strengthening the Judiciary -
The Credit would contribute about US$850,000 for reform of business laws, training, publication
and dissemination of the texts and strengthening the commercial jurisdictions of courts. This
component would build on the findings of a recent study and the ensuing action plan and would
include: (a) based on ongoing inventory of existing commercial and business laws, consolidation,
publication and dissemination of such laws, as well as rehabilitation of the process of publication
of the Official Journal; (b) review of the Commercial Code and other commercial and business
legislation, with particular emphasis on revision of legislation governing: (i) ownership of
property, (ii) establishment, registration and operation of conrpanies, (iii) liquidations,
bankruptcies, and company reorganizations, and (iv) investment and labor; (c) establis' nent of
a commercial court jurisdiction at the level of district courts in Moroni and Anjouan; (d) training
for lawyers and magistrates, with special emphasis on training in commercial au business laws
for the benefit of magistrates, lawyers, ushers and court registrars; and (e) introduction of revised
judicial procedures to accelerate and strearnline the judicial process. The project would finance



- 4 -
a legal reform coordinator, short-term international technical assistance for the implementation
of reforms, equipment for the Ministry of Justice and the courts, specialized training of
magistrates and lawyers and para-legal staff in business law, and technical assistance to improve
the Ministry's ability routinely to draft and update legislation. In the area of institutional
strengthening and training, the approach to be pursued under the project will involve starting with
a small, well-focused intervention (for example, traLning and provision of reference materials at
the level of a tribunal in Moroni) which can be replicated elsewhere subsequently.
0  lImlementirLg the Government Strategy: Institutional Strengthening and Ca aciy Building-The
Ministry of Finance is already responsible for implementing a short-term action plan agreed with
the Bank and the IMF, which would among other things relieve the tax burden on SSEs. It will
also carry out a study to formulate the medium-term action plan to propose further reductions and
streamline corporate taxation; to determine whether and to what extent the fiscal benefits of the
investment code can be integrated into the tax code, in parallel with appropriate investnent
legislation to strengthen investors' legal property rights and provide for independent arbitration;
and formulate a set of tourism and export incentives. To decrease the cost of doing business and
create opportunities for the private sector, the Government will continue the process of
privatization and public enterprise restructuring. Priority will be given to studying the port and
the electricity company (in collaboration with French Aid), and adopting and implementing a
restructuring plan for oil importing and privatization of a number of the port's commercial
activities (e.g. shipping and handling). IDA financing of about US$400,000 would be made
available for hiring the project coordinator and the project accountant, and for contracting expert
assistance for training and for the preparation of the above studies and action plans.
7.    The detailed costs of the program, as well as the financing arrangements, are presented in
Schedule A. Procurement and disbursement arrangements are summarized in Schedule B. A timetable
of key project processing events and status of IDA operations in the Comoros are given in Schedule C
and D, respectively. A map of the Comoros is attached. A Staff Appraisal Report No. 12712-COM,
dated June 1, 1994, is being distributed separately.
8.     Project Implemen tipn.  Overall coordination of project implementation would be the
responsibility of the Ministry of Finance. A local project coordinator and a project accountant, financed
by the Credit, would be located at the Ministry of Finance. The coordinator would be responsible for
overseeing the execution of the institutional strengthening and capacity building component, and
monitoring the execution of the other components, particularly with respect to procurement and
accounting. The PFIs would implement the line of credit. The investment fuds would be made
available to PFIs, which would pass them on to the private sector. PFIs would appraise and take the
credit risk for subproject lending, while the Government would take the foreign exchange risk. The
Ministry of Justice would be responsible for the legal reform and judicial strengthening component. A
legal reform coordinator, financed by the Credit, would be located in the Ministry of Justice. Drafting
of new laws and training in business law would be undertaken by local and international experts. The
EDF would be managed by the CASP or another institution acceptable to IDA. The engineer and the
financial aaalyst would be hired internationally, as would the short-term experts, but counterpart
arrangements would enable on-the-job and in-house training.
9.         ect Sustaina  iity. Improvements in the business environment are expected to have a lasting
impact on the level and quality of investments in the Comoros. Financial intermediary lending for
productive investments will benefit from the availability of long-term funds by diminishing the potential



for maturity mismatches. The legal and institutional strengthening components would involve local
counterpart staff, who will be trained by experts, to ensure continuity and sustainability. The use of
expert advice is expectAd to have a permanent impact on the capacity of private sector management and
enhance the competitiveness of private firms, thus ensuring sustainable private sector-led growth.
Moreover, the CASP already benefits from donor financing and from local resources, and the assistance
to promoters is likely to continue beyond the project. Finally, by lowering the cost of doing business and
stimulating SSEs, tourism and exports, the Comoros would be able to sustain its growth objecives.
10.   Lessons From Previous 1DA Involvement. IDA extended a line of credit (Cr. 1378-COM, of
May 12, 1983) to the Development Bank of Comoros (BDC). This Credit's Project Completion Report
(PCR No. 8764-COM, distributed to the Executive Directors on November 1, 1990) indicated that the
project was implemented faster than anticipated and attained most of its development objectives. The
report also noted that the political situation was unstable and further deterioration, as well as the planned
reductions in the number of civil servants, including some who had guaranteed subloans by BDC to
subborrowers, might have had a negative impact on BDC's portfolio: a situation that has, in fact,
materialized. BDC has already constituted sufficient provisions for the part of the portfolio that is
affected, and has agreed to prepare a business plan to strengthen the institution and make it more
responsive to SSEs. In line with the approach towards broader-based and more efficient intermediation,
the project has moved away from a single institution approach tjwards a multi-institution type operation.
11.   Bank experience with technical assistance projects in Africa has been mixed, due to lack of
ownership by Governments, and because long-term experts have tended to substitute for their
counterparts, while neither the work program nor expected results have been clearly identified. The
institutional strengthening proposed for the Ministries of Finance and Justice will finance expert advice
and training for local stwff. This support will be provided mainly through short-term assistance provided
by international and local experts, collaborating closely and effectively with qualified and motivated
government counterparts. These experts are expected to have access to decision makers to ensure rapid
actions, while working as a team with their counterparts and providing them with on-the-job training.
12.   Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The latest Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for the
Comoros was discussed with the Board on December 14, 1993. As indicated in the project objectives,
the project is in full agreemLnt with, and an essential component of, this strategy, which is founded on
private sector-led development.  According to the CAS, with better macroeconomic policies, an
appropriate enabling environment for the private sector, outward orientation and human resource
development, the Comoros could emulate the successful growth experience of its neighbors in the Indian
Ocean - Mauritius and Seychelles - and improve the standard of living of its people. Through economic
and sector work and carefully selected and well-targeted operations, the Bank, in close collaboration with
the Comoros's principal donors, endeavors to help the Comoros move in that direction. The proposed
project is a small but important first step.
13.   Agreed Actions. The Govermnent has adopted a Statement of Sectoral Policy, agreed during
negotiations, where all the actions related to improving the business environment would be spelled out.
The Credit Agreement provides for a mid-term review, in late 1996, to ensure its proper implementation
and redefinition, where needed. In order to help assess the developmental impact, quantified monitorable
targets have been developed in the SAR and key indicators agreed during negotiations are included in the
Credit Agreement. Other agreements include commitnents by the Government to review interest rates
periodically to ensure they reflect inflation and macro-economic conditions; by the BDC to prepare and
implement its business plan; and by each PFI to maintain a satisfactory capital adequacy ratio. Signature
T

of at least one participating agreement between the Governmerit and a PHI and of the Grant Agreement
for EDF, and the establishment of the Law Reform commission are conditions of effeztiveness. Other
conditions include hiring the project accountant and the legal reform coordinator, opening a project
account and regular deposit of counterpart funds.
14.   Environmen   Ape           e project is classified as category "B'l. An area that has received
considerable attention during project preparation is the need to ensure that proposed investnment projects
do not damage the environment. While the exact zature of subprojects to be financed is not known, the
level of the Comoros's industrial development and its comparative advantage suggest that most
subprojects would be undertaken mainly by micro-enterprises and small-sized service activities, without
significant environmental impact. In December 1993, the Council of Ministers adopted an Environmental
Policy Statement, which has been discussed with IDA. Currently the Parliament is considering a National
Environmental Law. The adoption of the National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP), being prepared
with UN assistance, is expected in early July 1994. TMis plan would include a general classification
scheme and regulations for industries. Moreover, under a proposed IDA-financed environment project,
the Ministry of Tourism and the Environment will be strengthened to ensure proper implementation of
the NEAP. In the medium term, local capacity for conducting appropriate envirounmental tests will be
created with the support of the proposed environment project. Initially under the Credit, PFIs will be
responsible for sensitizing subborrowers to the importance of environmental aspects of their proposed
subprojects.  Bank supervision would confirm  that the PFIs screen subprojects to ensure that
environmental aspects are covered adequately in the appraisal. Banks will receive specialized training
in this area. Subprojects likely to zause damage to the environment would have to provide an acceptable
mitigating plan.
15.    Progam Objective Categoria;. The project would contribute to the following Bank Program
Objectives: (i) private sector development; (ii) financial intermediation; (iii) poverty reduction through
employment creation; and (iv) economic management. This project forms part of the Program of
Targeted Interventions for poverty reduction. The credit component and Enterprise Development Fund
(which together make up over 40 percent of the project) are expected to benefit disproportionateiy the
poor as (a) it will assist informal operators to graduate to the formal sector and thus out of poverty; (b)
many enterprises will be artisanal, construction and other sectors that tend to emr loy disproportionately
the poor and (c) the poor, who presently have limited access to credit to form a small business, will
constitute the bulk of new borrowers. This project was endorsed under the CAS as a means to reduce
poverty in Comoros through job creation and private sector development.
16.   Benef5ts and Risks. The proposed operation is a complement to the Comoros's macro-economic
adjustment program already launched with Bank and IMF support. The project would help spur private
investment and assist the Comoros achieve its growth and poverty alleviation objectives. Major expected
benefits would stem from an enhanced supply response by small-scale private sector investors, which
would create the employment opportunities that are critical for the success of adjustment and the reduction
of poverty. The Comoros is undergoing a dual process of political and economic liberalization. A
possible risk would be renewed political instability which could shake investor confidence and slow down
the process of revamping the legal and regulatory framework. This could mean that the private sector
investment and the implementation of a well-focused private sector development strategy could be slower
than expected. In view of the Government's track record in the last two years, this risk is not expected
to be significant.



17.   Recommendatign.  I am satisfied that the proposed Credit complies with the Articles of
Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.

NOTE ON PROJECTS Wlrlll SIGNIFICANT DISBURSEMENT LAGS
1.    A review of the portfolio took place in March 1993. Implementation of ate three active projects
in the Comoros has significarntly improved. Disbursement lags of two projects have beeii brought down
to 26 percent and 36 percent and disbursements under the third operation improved from 100 percent to
69 percent. 'Ihis resulted from sustained efforts of the Government implementation agencies to improve
project execution, including change of the local management teams, adequate allocation of local operating
funds in tde budget, and close monitoring of key project components.
2.    Status of the three ongoing projects is sumnmarized below:
(a)    Macro-economic Reform and Capacity Building Credit (2270-OQM . Implementation
of MERCAP has substantially improved since July 1992. The rising trend of current
expenditures was reversed, the civil service reform has been accelerated, and trade
liberalization has progressed well. Based on this progress the B3ank declared the Credit
effective in December 1992 and released the first tranche. Since then, the Comoros has
kept the adjustment program on course and the credit has been upgraded from a 3 rating
to a 2 rating since January 1993. Progress on MERCAP implementation will continue
to be closely monitored and, if it continues to be satisfactory, the second tranche of US$3
million may be released by end-June 1994.
(b)    Highwav Maintenance (2207-COM). Implementation of the Road Maintenance Project
is now making good progress, despite some delays in effectiveness and initial difficulties
faced by the project unit in handling the project. This is due mostly to the improvement
in the overall financial situation, including regular replenishment of the Road Fund and
the timely payments of civil servant salaries. The effect of the CFA devaluation will cut
30 percent of the buying power of the Road Fund over 1993 and will reduce the volume
of maintenance works. Bidding for periodic maintenance works by contractors is
underway according to a detailed schedule, and routine maintenance works have starled
on the three islands. Disbursements on this Credit are expected to accelerate from
US$0.3 million in FY93 to US$1.7 million in FY94.
(c)    Second Education (1751-COMI.  Following the mid-term review in March 1992
combined wii the appointment of a new project director, implementation of the Second
Education project improved significantly. The project rating was changed from a 3 to
a 2 in March 1993 and the closing date was extended by one more year to June 30, 994.
Measures recommended during the review have been largely implemented, namely the
restructuring of the Ministry of Education and red&rloyment of staff to improve internal
efficiency, strengthening of inspection services and reduction of repetition rates, and
improved procurement and distribution of textbooks to schools. 'The remaining 42
percent of the Credit is expected to be fully disbursed by end-1994 as large commitments
have already been made for textbooks and school equipment.
