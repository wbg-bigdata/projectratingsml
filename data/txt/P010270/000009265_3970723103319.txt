FIFTH TELECOMMUNCATIONS PROJECT
LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:           :  Islamic Republic of Pakistan
Amount              : $100 million equivalent
Terms:              : Twenty years, Including five years of grace, at the
standard variable interest rate.
Project Description:  The project would constitute the entire investment
program (except for ongoing works and preinvestment
costs for the future plan) for Pakistan's Telegraph
and Telephone (T&T) Department over FY87-90. It
would expand local, long-distance, and international
telephone and telex networks, while increasing the
organizational capacity of T&T. This growth would be
reinforced with a program of rehabilitation,
replacement, and improved operations and maintenance.
Benifits:              In strengthening the telecommunications system, the
project would address one of the chief bottlenecks to
economic and social development. While business and
government subscribers would benefit most from the
improvement in long distance, nationwide dialling,
international and telex facilities, the provision of
new subsidiary routes, rural exchanges, and public
call offices would benefit currently unserviced rural
areas.
Risks:                 Since the technology to be employed has been well
tested elsewhere, the major risk is one of inadequate
implementation capacity on the part of T&T. To
reduce this risk, the project would focus on the
institutional aspects of expansion and
modernization. This emphasis would be ensured by
regular review with the Bank of progress In meeting a
series of physical and managerial targets and service
quality indicators.

I. THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SECTOR
Background
1.01      Telecommunications services, comprising domestic and
international telephone, telegraph, and telex, are managed and controlled
by the Pakistan Telegraph & Telephone (T&T) Department of the Federal
Ministry of Communications. T&T is also responsible for the licensing of
commercial and amateur transmitters and receivers, and controls the use of
radio frequencies in the country. Military, police, railways, and other
agencies operate separate networks for their own use. The Pakistan
Television Corporation leases microwave channels from T&T for its national
programs. Other organizations also lease T&T's facilities where
appropriate.
1.02      Telephone Industries of Pakistan (TIP) and Carrier Telephone
Industries (CTI) are the only telecommunications equipment manufacturing
companies in Pakistan, and they operate under the authority of the Ministry
of Communications. The Government of Pakistan (GOP) is the majority
shareholder in both companies. TIP was established in 1952 as a public
sector company with Siemens AG of West Germany (with a 16Z minority
interest) and has the capacity to produce about 30,000 lines of
electromechanical switching equipment (EMD) per annum, as well as private
branch exchange (PBX) equipment (including some electronic PBX types),
trunk exchanges, manual boards, telephone instruments, electronic
teleprinters and mechanical office typewriters. The average local value
added in TIP's products is about 50%. The company employs about 3,500
people and also installs exchange equipment for T&T. CrI was established
in 1969 as a public sector company, also with Siemens AG of West Cermany
(with a minority interest of 47%). It manufactures carrier multiplex
equipment, voice frequency telegraph, ultra-high frequency (UHF)
multichannel radio relay systems and electronic components, and employs
about 360 people. The average local value added in CTI's products is about
30%. Production of pulse code modulation (PCM) equipment began recently.
Facilities for domestic manufacture of telephone cables do not exist, but a
privately owned factory is scheduled to be in production by end 1986.
1.03      The EMD technology has now become obsolete.  In 1983 T&T invited
bids for the transfer of technology for local production of modern
electronic digital stored program control (SPC) switching equipment.
Simultaneously, bids for the direct imports of 50,000 SPC local exchange
lines and 25,000 lines of trunk exchanges were requested. With the
establishment of domestic capability to manufacture SPC exchange equipment,
domestic production of EMD switching equipment will be gradually phased out
and used only for appropriate expansion of existing EMD exchanges and for
spares.
Access to Service
1.04      As of June 30, 1985 there were about 469,000 direct exchange
lines (DELs) and 573,000 telephones serving a population of 94.3 million.



Pakistan's telephone density, at 0.6 DELs per 100 population, compares
poorly with the 5.9 average for 12 developing countries in Asia. Existing
service is concentrated in the main cities of Karachi, Lahore, and
Islamabad/Rawalpindi, where 60% of DELs serve only 11% of the population.
The average density in these areas of 2.4 DELs per 100 population'/ is
also low in comparison with other urban centers in South Asia.  In the
rural areas, 23% of DELs serve 84% of the population with a resulting
density of only 0.12 DELs per 100 population.
1.05      Service in rural areas is mainly provided through 2,000 Public
Call Offices (PCOs) and small manual exchanges. There are 341 telegraph
offices, of which 220 are rural. Telex service Is available only in 11
major cities and operates together with [1 Gentex exchanges. Development
of the telecommunications sector between 1975 and 1985 is outlined in
Annex 1.
Existing Facilities and Quality of Service
1.06      As of June 30, 1985, installed capacity was 469,000 lines for
telephone and 5,370 for telex with average exchange fills of 83% and 702
respectively. Of the 469,000, 92% were automatic. For long distance
calls, subscribers can use the nationwide dialing system (NWD) which
connects major and small citie., or the subscriber trunk dialing system
(STD), which connects only a few cities in the long distance network. The
manual interurban telephone system does not provide good connections and
has low quality. The overall call completion rates are about 35% for local
calls, 12% for long distance calls and about 13% for subscriber dialed
international calls, which is poor. Delays for manual long distance calls
usually range from one to four hours and from two to ten hours for
internat'.onal calls.
1.07      The poor quality of service may be attributed to the following:
(a)  obsolete and worn out subscriber network of insufficient
capacity;
(b)  inadequate maintenance and preventive maintenance
procedures, combined with a lack of spare parts;
(c)  inadequate qualifications of maintenance personnel, and
poor supervision and control;
(d)  inadequate fault monitoring equipment; and
(e)  insufficient financial resources directed to maintenance
activity, and little incentive to do this.
1/ In Islamabad/Rawalpindi the density is 3.6.



In addition to deficient service, incorrect and poorly detailed billing of
long distance calls is causing frequent subscriber complaints and
contributing to a general perception of poor management in the sector.
1.08      T&T management is aware of these problems and is attempting to
improve the operation of the system by replacing old cables and switches,
rehabilitating parts of the subscriber and NWD network, and installing
fault-monitoring equipment. A manpower and training study is being
undertaken to investigate means to increase the effectiveness and
efficiency of the operation and maintenance personnel. Management system
improvements to be undertaken by the proposed project, such as training,
improvement of maintenance, and moves towards financial autonomy are
intended to improve the quality of efficiency and service.
Demand for Service
1.09      As T&T does not have adequate methods for forecasting demand,
projections are based on historical records of registered waiters. T&T was
meeting 65% of its estimate of demand in the mid 1970s yet currently meets
only 62%. The shortfall is understated by the extent of unregistered
demand, evident in recently-commissioned exchanges where the resulting
demand for service was more than double the number of registered
applicants. Although the capacity of the telecommunications system has
increased from less than 15,000 DELs in 1947 to about 469,000 DELs in
1985 (an average growth rate of 7-8% p.a.), the sector has not been able to
keep pace with growing demand for telecommunications services. Expressed
demand, 2/ currently 792,000 subscribers, has been growing at about 14% per
annum over the last five years. Even with the investments under the
project, the gap between supply and demand is expected to widen (see Annex
2). Although the demand for telex service has been growing at 16% p.a.
over the past five years, the percentage of demand satisfied has increased
from 58% to 63% due to the rapid expansion of telex facilities. The Fifth
Project will, by June 1990, have provided an additional 11,800 telex lines
which will meet 68Z of projected demand. Demand for trunk calls is
expected to almost double over the next four years. The projected increase
in transmission capacity is expected to ease congestion on the long
distance network and contribute to the improvement in the call completion
rate from 15% to 30%. The growth rate of international calls over the past
six years has been about 57% per annum. This may be explained by the large
number of overseas workers and the expansion of international facilities.
Demand for this service is expected to quadruple to 71.2 million calls per
year by June 1990.
Sector Development Strategy and Goals
1.10      The Government's recent emphasis on the development of the
telecommunications service reflects a major change in priorities. In
2/ Working lines (DELs) plus pending applications.



recognizing the importance of telecommunications to economic development,
the Government has decided to provide T&T In the Slxth Five Year Plan with
sufficient resources to ensure an expansion rate of 15% per annum compared
to the historical average of 7% - 8%. The Sixth Five Year Plan (FY84-88)
defines the national objectives for the sector as:
(a) to improve T&T's operational and management efficiency
and the quality of service;
(b) to expand the telephone network by 520,000 lines; raising
density from 0.6 to 0.9 DELs per 100 population by the
end of FY88;
(c) to extend local and long distance facilities to areas of
highest demand and revenues per line bearing In mind the
requirements of agriculture, industry, administrative,
and social services;
(d) to expand and improve the International, telex and
telegraph networks;
(e) to introduce modern technology and standards and to
maintain and extend domestic manufacturing facilities;
(f) to study the feasibility of converting T&T into a self-
financing entity;
(g) to encourage the participation of private interests In
the sector's development.
Sector Constraints
1.11      The major constraints on the development of the sector are the
following:
(a) Organizational: Inadequate orgarizational structure,
management systems and procedures designed for efficient
operation, particularly with the increased and
sophisticated network projected by 1990. Moves towards
autonomy are under consideration but no government policy
decision has yet been taken;
(b) Financial: Although T&T's operations generate adequate
local funds to meet its development objectives, T&T can
only use these funds up to the government-established
budgetary ceiling. Since the sector is expanding, the
budget ceilings must, within the overall macroeconomic
constraints facing Pakistan, also be raised;
(c) Manpower: T&T is facing critical shortages of skilled
staff at higher levels to manage and maintain the new
technologies and staff for more routine tasks such as



cable jointing. Furthermore, T&T's permanent staff are
civil servants and, as a government department, T&T is
bound to the official salary structure. Consequently, it
Is difficult to attract and retain the essential
qualified staff to plan and manage critical aspects of
the telecommunications network.
The Bank Group's Role and Strategy
1.12      The Bank Group has been involved in four telecommunications
projects In Pakistan totaling loans of $91.8 million. The first credit
(145-PAK) was approved in March 1969, followed by two more credits (186-PAK
and 510-PAK) in May 1970 and September 1974, and a loan (2122-PAK) was
approved in April 1982.3/ These projects have generally been successful
and achieved their objectives.
1.13      The four Bank Group assisted projects have enabled the telephone
system in Pakistan to be expanded from about 110,000 DELs in 1970 to about
469,000 DELs at the end of FY85, and national telephone density to
increase from 0.29 to 0.6 DELs per 100 population. Subscriber direct long
distance (STD) dialing and telex service were introduced and international
telecomainications were developed and enhanced.
1.14      The Project Performance Audit Report (No. 3276, December 31,
1980) on the third project noted these substantial achievements even though
there was a delay of about two and one half years in project execution.
This reflected the delay in government appropriation of funds despite T&T
generating local funds In excess of Its requirements. There was also a
delay in introducing measures to permit TET to operate on a semiautonomous
commercial basis. New procedures, such as the establishment of the T&T
Fund4/ and the introduction of commercial accounting techniques, have
since been introduced, and delays in government appropriation no longer
occur. Execution of the Fourth Project, after initial delays in completing
cofinancing arrangements with ADB, OECF and KfW, is progressing
satisfactorily, with disbursements being generally in line with the
appraisal estimates.
1.15      The main areas in which the Bank Group has had influence are:
(a) institutional improvements reflected in:
(i) some measure of financial autonomy primarily through
establishment of commercial accounting practices in
1979 and the creation of a T&T fund within the
overall Government Consolidated Fund;
3/ Data on this lending activity is given in project files.
4/ Part of GOP's consolidated fund and contains local revenues generated
by TET's in excess of funds used for its operation and development.
The amount which TET can use for its operation and development is up to
GOP established budgetary ceilings.



- 6 -
(11) tariff Increases in the late 1970s on Bank advice
which were important for T&T's financial viability;
(lli) improvement in productivity through the reduction of
the staffing ratio from 110 per 1.000 telephones in
1977 to the current level of 68; and
(lv) Initiating the computerization of T&T's activities;
(b)  major technological decision- to Introduce digital
technology (switching and transmission), satellite
communication, and fiber optics In Pakistan;
(c)  the development of a balanced network with broader
coverage of rural areas within existing constraints; and
(d)  assisting In arranging cofinancing. particularly for the
fourth project.
Despite these achievements. T&T's Institutional structure is not adequate
for the new technology and progrsm expansion currently being introduced.
Weaknesses In maintenance, organization. quality of service and operational
effectiveness will be addressed under the Fifth Project.
1.16      The Government's decision to substantially increase resources
allocated to the sector, and the Bank's ability to assist Pakistan In
addressing the constraints outlined above, warrants continued Bank
Involvement In the sector. In the Fifth Project, the overall role of the
Bank would be: (a) to act as a catalyst to help Pakistan mobilize the
required foreign funds and to organize the associated procurement on the
besL possible combina-tion of terms and unit costs, and (b) to assist T&T in
identifying and Initiating activities designed to resolve the imediate and
longer term Institutional, manpower, efficiency, technical, technological
and financial Issues facing the sector. More specifically, the Bank would
assist: (a) institutionally, by improving the management system of T&T and
extending the gains made towards financial autonomy; (b) technically, by
providing support and training particularly in network planning to ensure
development of a balanced system responsive to economic priorities and new
technology and by introducing new digital technology and procuring proven
modern equipment at least cost; (c) operationally, by undertaking measures
to Improve the quality of service and operation and maintenance; and
finally, (d) financially, by financing part of the foreign cost of the
development program and ensuring that adequate local funds are available.
Although more private sector participation in the sector Is encouraged by
the Government, the means still have not been fully articulated.
Consequently, during the Fifth Project, the Bank will encourage
participation of the private sector as suppliers and contractors, and
expand the training prograns to accommodate contractors.



II.  THE PROGRAM AND THE PROJECT
The Program
2.01      T&T's FY84-90 investment Plan comprises: (a) the carryover
portioa frnm GOP's Fifth Five Year Plan and the ongoing works of the first
three years (FY84-86) of the Sixth Plan (FY84-88); (b) the proposed project
(FY87-90), covering the last two years of GOP's Sixth Plan (FY87-88) and
the first two years of the Seventh Plan; and (c) preinvestment for the next
plan. T&T's plan has been accepted by the Planning Commission and the
Ministries of Finance and Communications (para 2.09). The total cost of
T&T's FY84-90 investment program is estimated at PRs 19.6 billion ($1.2
billion), including a fcreign cost component of PRs 10.6 billion ($631
million). The fifth project cost is about 702 of the total program cost
(see Annex 3). This program is far smaller than would be needed to meet
the rising demand for telecommunications services (para 1.09) but reflects
the constraints outlined above (para 1.11). Subsequent to the appraisal
mission, the GOP five year plan has been replaced by a three year rolling
plan. However, the targets for T&T have been largely maintained.
The Prolect
2.02      Implementation of the project, to be partly financed by the Bank,
is expected to cover four years, FY87-90. The project addresses the
institutional and technical constraints outlined above (para 1.11) through
the following components:
(a) provision of local network facilities over the period
July 1986 to June 1990 for an additional exchange
capacity of 402,000 lines;
(b) installation of nationwide dialing facilities for an
additional 94 towns and cities and the expansion of the
transmission capability of the long distance network by
9,000 channels;
(c) continued modernization and improvement of telegraph and
telex services, increasing telex exchange capacity by
11,600 lines and the extension of telex and telegraph
facilities to smaller towns;
(d) provision of new international telecommunications
channels v±a satellite, submarine cables and improvement
in maritime communication facilities;
(e) replacement of worn out cables and exchange equipment
(75,000 lines), open wire carrier systems and trunk
positions;
(f) improvement of T&T's organizational structure and
management systems to enhance T&T's operational



-8-
efficiency, labor productivity, the quality of its
services and its medium and long-term planning
capability;
(g) studies and economic analyses of T&T's oprations and
investment program and a review of its tariff structure;
(h) modernization and expansion of T&T's training and
research programs and facilities;
(i) the provision of consultants' services to support
training, studies, and management system improvement.
Supplementary data on the breakdown of local network provision, PCOs and
other facilities are given in Annex 4 and in the project files. Proposed
terms of reference for technical assistance are in Annex 8. Map IBRD 18739
shows planned telecommunications development under the proposed project.
Project Cost
2.03      Total  project cost is estimated at PRs 13,729 million
($817.2 million) with a foreign exchange component of PRs 7,764 million
($462.2 million) which includes an indirect foreign exchange component of
PRs 851.2 million ($50.7 million). Estimated local expenditures include
customs duties of PRs 2,709.7 million ($161.3 million), although T&T is
exempt from taxes on local goods and civil works. The project is heavily
directed toward expansion of the local telephone network (51% total project
cost) with investment in long distance, international, telex, telegraph and
data networks comprising about 26% of total project cost. Cost details for
the project are presented in Annexes 3 and 5 and summarized below.

2.04      The project cost estimates are based on estimated April 1986
prices for equipment, civil works and customs duties. Physical
contingencies of 5% for local and foreign costs of equipment, 10% for local
costs of civil works and 10% for local and foreign costs of services have
been added to the base cost. Price contingencies are based on expected
increases in foreign costs of 7.0% in FY87, 6.8% in FY88, 6.9% in FY89 and
7.1% in FY90, and local cost increases of 8.0% in FY86, 7.8% in FY87, 7.5%
in FY88, 7.3% in FY89 and 7.0% in FY90.
Project Financing
2.05      The proposed sources of financing for the project are shown in
Table 2.2 below. The proposed Bank loan of $100 million would finance: (a)
civil works ($5 million, 100% of foreign expenditures and 65% of local
expenditures); (b) equipment, materials and spare parts ($84 million, 100%
of foreign expenditures, 100% of local expenditures of ex-factory cost and
65% of local expenditures for other items procured locally); (c)
consultants and training ($1.5 million, 100% of costs); and (d) unallocated
category ($9.5 million). The Bank loan would finance mainly equipment and
materials which are not considered likely to attract bilateral aid or
comercial or mixed credit financing such as cables and accessories,
training and test equipment, and expansion of research facilities. The
Bank loan would also finance optical fiber, foreign consultancy services



- 10 -
and training, and some proprietary items. The ADB loan ($73 million) will
finance equipment, proprietary items, some cables and services. The OECF
loan ($12 million) will finance telex equipment. ITU/UNDP will provide
$3.5 million to assist T&T in improving its training programs and
facilities.   The contract for the direct import of 50,000 local and 25,000
NWD digital lines was signed with Siemens of FRG and a letter of intent was
issued for the establishment of digital switching equipment manufacturing
plant in Pakistan. The foreign cost ($112 million) of the package is being
financed by mixed credits from KfW and Siemens. Foreign suppliers' equity
participation in the manufacture is expected. Export credits ($64.8
million) will finance transmission equipment, telex,satellite station, the
submarine cable and some services. Suppliers financing of $20 million has
already been secured for the submarine cable to the Gulf States. T&T
and/or Government are expected to provide $96.9 million for the remaining
foreign cost elements. Currently the possibility of a -B loan is being
examined.  If a  B  loan is arranged, it will replace T&T and/or Government
funding.
2.06      T&T is expected to continue to internally generate sufficient
resources to finance the local cost element of its investment program,
operations and maintenance. At negotiations, assurances were obtained
that GOP shall make available to T&T sufficient funds to implement the
total investment program and to meet its estimated operating and
maintenance costs for FY87-90. The Bank will also review with GOP, the
proposed allocation of funds to T&T not later than April 1 of each year. A
similar covenant, without the proviso of annual review, is in effect under
the fourth Bank project. While there have been no problems under the
current project, the change to an annual review will attempt to minimize
implementation delays stemming from insufficient funds which could
conceivably occur given the much larger financial requirements of the Fifth
Project. If autonomy is granted to T&T during the project period,
proposals will be studied for alternative methods of raising funds for T&T
in the course of the study on steps towards autonomy.

Procurement
2.07      The procurement arrangements for the project items are summarized
in Table 2.3 below. Equipment and civil works totaling $88.5 million to be
financed from the Bank loan would be procured through international
competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance with Bank guiJelines. Local
manufacturers would be allowed a preference of 15Z or the import duty,
whichever was lower, subject to usual Bank terms and conditions. Contracts
for consultant services and training financed by the Bank, totaling $1.5
million, would be let according to Bank guidelines. Contracts for
proprietary items, to be financed by the Bank, totaling $10 million for
spare parts and system expanaion would be let following negotiations
between T&T and the original suppliers (TIP and CTI). Equipment totaling
$73 million to be financed by ADB would be procured in accordance with its
guidelines. OECF would finance $12 million of foreign supplied telex
equipment procured according to its procedures. The UNDP would provide
technical assistance ($3.5 million) for training in accordance with its
procedures. A contractor for digital switching (including a local
manufacturing plant) ($112 million) to be financed with mixed credits from
KfW was selected through international bidding taking into consideration
price and terms. Although this equipment would not be financed by the
Bank, since it is central to the rest of the project, as conditions of
effectiveness of the Bank loan, the Government would (a) execute a contract
for direct import digital switching for 50,000 local lines and 25,000
nationwide dialling lines and (b) issue a letter of intent for construction
and installation of a digital switching equipment manufacturing plant and
related transfer of technology. Some additional items will be procured on
a price and terms basis ($12.5 million) and limited bidding or direct
negotiation for proprietary items ($37.3 million). Some proceeds of the
Bank loan (estimated to be $5.0 million) would be applied to those bids
which did not attract good financing offers.  In such cases the bid award
would be on the basis of price alone in accordance with Bank guidelines.
Local competitive bidding would be sought from private contractors for
cable construction ($10 million) and for buildings ($21 million). T&T
would procure the remaining proprietary items and locally procured items
through direct purchase, force account, or negotiated contacts ($435.9
sillion).  T_ order to avoid some of the delays incurred by earlier
projects, standardized procurement documents will be used which have been
reviewed and found satisfactory to the Bank. Prior Bank review of
procurement documentation would be required for contracts larger than
$500,000 to be financed by the Bank.

Disbursements
2.08      The projected disbursement schedule is given in Annex 6.  The
schedule is based on the profile for the three previous telecommunication
projects in Pakistan, which have performed significantly better than the
Bank's overall profile for telecommunications operations. The Third and
Fourth Projects have been disbursed generally in line with their estimated
profiles. (In the Fourth Project, although disbursement was initially
slow, the loan is expected to be disbursed according to the appraisal
estimates). In addition, the issuance of tenders for 40% by value of Bank
financed contracts was a condition of Board Presentation for the Fifth
Project. T&T expects to complete Bank financed components of the project
by June 1988. Disbursement would be made on the basis of 100% of the CIF
cost of imported goods and services, 100% of foreign expenditures for civil
works, 100% of the cost of foreign consultants and training, and 100% of
ex-factory prices of locally manufactured items. Disbursements will also
be made against 65% of local expenditures for civil works and for other
items procured locally. All disbursements would be made against full
documentation. In order to expedite the flow of funds for disbursement, a
Special Account (Revolving Fund) would be established in US dollars with a
commercial bank to handle contracts below $500,000 equivalent. The initial
deposit by the Bank would be the equivalent of $3.5 million, and an amount
equal to about four months expenditures would be maintained in the account
in accordance with standard Bank procedures.
Project Implementation
2.09      The project would be completed by June 30, 1990.  The proposed
implementation schedule is presented in Annex 7. The Development wing of
T&T will be responsible for overall project implementation. Its
headquarters staff, in association with planning staff, conduct centralized
procurement dctivities. Decentralized development staff around the country
are charged with day to day implementation of the different subprojects
which, when executed, are transferred to operations and maintenance staff.
T&T staff has gained adequate experience in project implementation under
previous projects and their implementation capability has been satisfac-
tory. However, the more complex installations and new technology will
require special assistance and supervision of the contractors and
suppliers. To avoid past bottlenecks, subcontracting to the private sector
for cable installation will be encouraged. Particular assistance will also
be required in focusing middle management on adopting a series of perform-
ance indicators (pars 2.14) to monitor performance and to establish an
information system for serior management. Under the fourth project, T&T
are engaging foreign consultants for the optimization of its urban
telephone network. Under the KfW loan, consultants are assisting T&T in
switching and transmission maintenance. T&T has also requested the ITU to
supply three training experts for the new technology. To prevent implemen-
tation delays, stemming from financing delays, anticipatory approval for
one PC-1 doc ment not yet approved by the Executive Committee of the
National Economic Council (ECNEC) has been obtained from the Chairman of
ECNEC.

Organizational Changes
2.10      Major organizational changes are required if T&T is to
efficiently manage a network expected to be over five times its current
size by 2000 and which will be based on a different technology than that
used in the past. In May 1985 GOP created a Deregulation Commission to
make recommendations on, inter alia, establishment of autonomous
corporation for telecommunication. The Commission, headed by the Governor
of the State Bank of Pakistan recently submitted its recommendations on the
future legal status of T&T to the Government. While no decision has yet
been taken, once it has, GOP will consult with the Bank on the mechanism,
timetable, and technical assistance required to implement changes. In the
meantime, GOP and T&T are firmly committed to the improvements of TWT's
organization, management and efficiency.
2.11      Toward this end, T&T had already created a Fundamental Planning
Unit as recommended by the Bank's appraisal mission. During negotiations,
T&T agreed to expand the role of this Unit to include not only the
technical planning, but also long term financial planning and human
resource development planning. T&T also agreed to establish an Economic
Sub-Unit and a Traffic Engineering Sub-unit within the Fundamental
Planning Unit. Detailed terms of reference for these units are contained
in Annex 8 and summarized below:
(a)   The Fundamental Planning Unit will consist of
professionals representing a broad range of technical,
economic, financial and planning skills and will be
assisted by local and internationally recruited experts.
The Unit will prepare T&T's technical strategy and
promote the introduction of modern system and traffic
engineering in a balanced fashion. It will update T&T's
Master Plan, and plan for rehabilitation of the existing
system, and prepare performance indicators to serve as
overall benchmarks to measure T&T's performance (para
2.14). The Unit will be responsible for defining T&T's
hucan resources development policy and planning T&T's
personnel and training requirements. A medium-and
long-term financial plan for T&T will be also devised by
the Unit.
(b)   The Economic Sub-unit will undertake studies and economic
analysis of T&T's operations and investment program, and
a review of its tariff structure (para 4.20).
(c) The Traffic Engineering Sub-unit will undertake traffic
measurements and design proper traffic engineering so as
to ensure optimal usage of the network and thereby
increase T&T's revenues.
At negotiations, an assurance was obtained that terms of reference of
consultants to assist the Fundamental Planning Unit in all aspects of its
work would be submitted to the Bank by October 31, 1986, and they will be
employed by March 31, 1987.

Technical Assistance
2.12      During negotiations, GOP confirmed that T&T is using or intends
to use the following technical assistance for institutional improvements:
a)   A ITU/UNDP assisted training improvement Project totaling
$8.15 million, including $3.5 million foreign exchange;
b)   A proposal from TELEVERKET (Sweden) for upgrading T&T's
Hairpur Staff College is under active consideration;
c)   ADB is providing, under its Telecommunications II
Project, a $100,000 Grant for a study of rural
telecommunications in Pakistan;
d)   In connection with the Siemens contract for direct import
and transfer of technology for the manufacture of digital
switching equipment, sizeable technical assistance will
be provided with financing from Siemens and KfW;
e)   T&T will hire local experts with its own funds to assist
the Economic Sub-unit;
f)   T&T will request short-term assistance from ITU for the
tariff study; and
g)   T&T will have access to assistance from the Government's
Organization and Methods Division and the Experts
Advisory Cell for Public Enterprises for implementation
of any decision to convert T&T into a corporation.
Recognizing the size of this outside assistance which is being or will be
used by T&T for institutional improvements, it was agreed that the
following amounts of technical assistance would be financed from the
proposed loan.

The total amount envisaged for technical assistance is $1.0 million. For
management training of T&T's personnel and familiarization with the
operation of foreign telecommunications administrations an additional
$0.5 million is envisaged.
2.13      To improve the quality of service, old and worn out equipment
will be replaced and maintenance procedures will be upgraaed. Training
requirements will be identified by consultants. using the results and
recommendations of the ongoing Manpower and Training study (para 1.08), and
maintenance procedures will be reviewed.
Performance Indicators
2.14      Indicators to assist in developing financial and management
systems and to monitor T&T's performance in executing the project are set
out in Annex 9. These targets for physical, financial, and
institutional capability have been discussed during negotiation and those
for FY87 have been agreed upon. It was agreed that during the
implementation period, T&T will analyze, in its half-yearly reports due
June 1 and December 1, its performance vis-a-vis the agreed indicators and
will annually reach agreement with the Bank, before April 1 of each fiscal
year, on targets, monitoring and necessary corrective measures for the
subsequent years.
IIl. THE IMPLEMENTING AGENCY
Organization
3.01      From its creation, T&T operated as a government department under
the Ministry of Communications with a number of its managerial and
operating functions performed by other government
authorities. Financial control was exercised by the Ministry of Finance,
accounting and auditing were performed by the Auditor General, personnel
matters controlled by the Public Service Commission, procurement by the
Supply Department, and building design and construction by the Public Works
Department. This was not conducive to efficient operation of T&T and did
not adequately define accountability and responsibility for the sector.
3.02      Largely as a result of Bank involvement in the sector, there has
been significant institutional development of T&T, such as the introduction
of commercial accounting practices in 1979, and the establishment of the
T&T fund (see para 1.14). All T&T revenues are credited to the fund,
established within GOP's consolidated fund effective FY82, and annual
budgetary ceilings are imposed by government for operating and capital
expenditures. The responsibilities for the accounting function, and
appropriate staff, were transferred to T&T on January 1, 1981. The
Director General of T&T now has the power to approve nonrecurrant
expenditures up to PRs 5 million, to reappropriate funds within approved
budgetary ceilings and to change conditions of employment for lower grade
staff. The present



- 18 -
organization of T&T is set out In Annex 11. The establishment of the T&T
fund largely removed the problem of funding delays. However, given the
rapid buildup in the investment program, inadequate budget allocations
could become a major constraint (para 1.11). During negotiations,
agreements have been reached that the government will ensure annual
budget allocations, sufficient to cover T&T's total investment plan (para
2.06).
3.03      For project Implementation, several units will be created within
T&T and management systems will be improved with the assistance of
consultants (para 2.11). The breakdown between the Government's equity in
and loans to T&T is somewhat unclear. While the distinction has not been
critical as long as T&T has been a government department, the situation
does undercut efforts to manage T&T as a commercial entity. GOP has agreed
that once a decision has been made on the future legal status of T&T, steps
shall also be taken to define the Government's equity in T&T, the loans
from the Government to T&T, and a schedule for repayment of the loans.
Staff
3.04      T&T has a workforce of about 39,100 (June 1985), with about 12%
senior staff. The staff ratio of 68 per 1,000 telephones is high, although
it has been reduced considerably from 129 per 1,000 telephones in 1971.
This decrease has occurred as a result of an increase in exchange line
connections by over 100% while staff has only increased by about 43%. This
is significant progress. T&T expects to further reduce staff ratios to 50
per 1,000 telephones by end FY89. Given that T&T is switching to digital
technology, requiring fewer, but better qualified personnel, the staff
ratios proposed in the performance indicators (para 2.14) and Annex 9 are
quite achievable.
Training
3.05      The Telecommunications Staff College, five Regional
Telecommunications Training Schools, and five District Telecommunications
Training Centres provide training for T&T staff. District schools conduct
basic courses for linemen and wiremen. Regional schools serve technicians
and telephone/telegraph operators, while the Staff College specializes in
more advanced courses for engineers and supervisors. The annual training
capacity is only about 4% of the current labor force, with only half of
this being utilized, which is inadequate. This reflects both the shortage
of training facilities and the staff's perception of the courses offered.
3.06      The training schools are not equipped to give the courses needed
in modern digital telecommunications systems. T&T with the help of ITU
experts will determine the numbers of staff to receive training in specific
areas, new course development, and the training of instructors, basing
their recommendations on the basic data being gathered by the ongoing



- 19 -
Manpower and Training Study (para 1.08). Since subcontracting to the
private sector is to be encouraged, T&T's training facilities would also be
used for training the subcontractors' staff. T&T will define the policies
in the area of human resource development and the training of mlanagement
with the help of technical assistance to ue financed by the Bank.
Consultants' terms of reference for 6 manmonths assistance will be
furnished to the Bank by October 31, 1986 and consultants will be employed
not later than March 31, 1987. Supplementary activities in the field of
planning T&T's personnel and training requirements, taking into account
planned technological changes and labor productivity goals, will be
assisted by the ITU/UNDP project.
Accounting
3.07      As part of the 1979 reorganization (para 3.02), T&T was required
to prepare commercial accrual accounts. Responsibility for the accounting
function was transferred from the Accountant General in Lahore to T&T on
January 1, 1981. Having responsibility for its own accounting, T&T's
financial management introduced stricter internal controls over cash
management, decentralized certain accounting functions, revalued fixed
assets, and mechanized some accounting procedures. The volume of T&T's
operations Justifies in-house computer facilities which are being provieed
under the ongoing project. Financial management systems will be improved,
with the assistance of consultants, with terms of reference acceptable to
the Bank, to develop basic data, management coefficients and key
performance indicators (para 2.12).
Audit
3.08      T&T's accounts are audited by:  (a) the Auditor General, whose
audit focuses on cash and compliance with government rules and regulations,
and (b) the Director of Commercial Audit who, under the Auditor General,
audits T&T's commercial accounts. The Auditor General can appoint an
external auditor if the Director of Commercial Audit is unable to produce
timely audit reports satisfactory to the Bank.
3.09      Under the ongoing project, T&T agreed to submit audited accounts
to the Bank within six months of the end of its fiscal year. So far, T&T
has not been able to comply with this covenant. The main reason for the
average three to four months delay has been T&T's dependence on government
accounting since it is a government department. For example, T&T must wait
for the government and government banks to close their accounts for
collection of telephone bills before it can finalize its balance sheet.
Information on collection may be up to six months late. Consequently,
during negotiations, assurances were obtained that T&T, will submit
unaudited financial statements to the Bank within six months of the end of
FY 87 and the corresponding audit report within six months thereafter.
This will be decreased to five months for the unaudited accounts and five
months for the audit report in FY88 and to four months for each fiscal year
thereafter.



- 20 -
Billing and Collection
3.10      T&T bills Its subscribers monthly and bills are prepared in
Karachi and Lahore on the computers of National Bank and Habib Bank. TET
is rapidly outgrowing these computer facilities, and the preparation of
bills has at times been delayed. Bills are generally sent about one month
after the close of the billing period. After receipt, the subscriber is
given one month to pay before his telephone is disconnected or other action
taken.
3.11      T&T has been criticized by the press and subscribers for
inaccurate bills. Adequate specification of long distance calls in T&T's
bills will only be possible through the use of toll ticketing and necessary
computer facilities and should decrease the cause for complaint. These are
being installed under the ongoing project in many parts of the country.
3.12      At the end of FY85, TET's accounts receivable for telecommunica-
tions services (including international services) were estimated to equal
about 4.7 months of billing which is acceptable. Amounts due to T&T from
private subscribers are equivalent to just over two months of billing,
since they pay within the prescribed time to avoid telephone disconnection,
however, government subscribers often pay late. At the end of FY85,
amounts due to TET for services rendered to government was estimated to be
over seven months of billing. While government billings account for only
17% of total revenues, the government agreed at negotiations to reduce
these arrears to 150 days of billings by June 30, 1987 and to 90 days of
billings by June 30, 1988. A timetable of this length is considered
necessary given the large number of bills in dispute. A condition of loan
effectiveness is that 20% of the amounts due to T&T from Government for
services as of June 30, 1985 has been paid; this could be achieved by the
automatic settlement of undisputed amounts.

estimates.
bI Excluding depreciation.
4.02      T&T's tariffs have remained essentially unchanged in nominal
terms since 1980, while inflation has pushed up operating costs with the
result that operating income (in real terms) per DEL has been falling over
the past four years. Even so, T&T has met the rate of return covenants
under past Bank projects satisfactorily, and is expected to continue to do
so without major changes in tariffs due to the increased traffic and
revenues made possible by additional equipment provided under the ongoing
and proposed projects.
Financial Position
4.03     T&T's financial position as of June 30, 1985 (provisional
estimate) is summarized below; details are in Annexes 11 and 13.

a/ See para 4.05.
4.04      From FY80, T&T shows the T&T-fund as an asset in its financial
statement. At the end of FY85, the T&T-fund amounted to over PRs 3,700
million. However, since these funds may be used only up to the government-
established budgetary ceiling and cannot be labeled as -current assets,'
they are shown under -other' assets.
4.05      No repayment schedule exists for government long-term loans to
T&T and the debt has therefore been accumulated in T&T's commercial
accounts. Nonetheless, T&T's FY85 share of long-term debt in total
capitalization of 18% is satisfactory. Repayment schedules are to be
established once GOP has decided on the future organizational structure of
T&T.
Valuation of Assets
4.06      The limited past records on fixed assets do not allow direct
estimation of their current replacement value; this led T&T to estimate,
with Bank agreement, replacement costs on the basis of the number of lines
still in service. In June 1984 this was estimated at PRs 27,500 per line,
including customs duties, whicn appears reasonable. Accumulated
depreciation was calculated from the year the lines were put into service
and depreciation charges were increased to reflect an average plant life of
20 years.
4.07      For the financial projections presented in this report, the FY84
assets, as valued by T&T (PRs 27,500 per line), and subsequent annual
additions have been revalued by 6% per annum, which is expected to reflect
the average future increase in the replacement cost of these assets.

bI On revalued basis.
c/ Excluding depreciation.
4.09      The projections are based on FY85 tariff levels.  The current
severe congestion in domestic traffic suppresses any major increase in long
distance call revenues until FY88, when most of the new equipment provided
under the project will be in service. The rate of -eturn is projected to
decline to 17Z in FY87, because it is assumed that T&T will become subject
to the corporate tax rate for a public sector company of 50% on operating
income after interest from FY87 onward. Despite the taxation assumed,
TMT's projected financial performance remains satisfactory.
4.10      To ensure satiefactory financial performance, during
negotiations assurances were obtained that T&T will maintain a rate of
return of at least 10% on net revalued fixed assets in operation as
covenanted under the ongoing project. To ensure the efficient operation of
T&T, separate monitorable performance indicators were agreed upon (para
2.14) and will be reviewed annually.

4.12      According to the financial projections, debt service coverage by
internal cash generation will not fall below 2.4 during any year of the
project period. After accounting for debt service and the return on
government equity, T&T's contribution from net internal sources to capital
expansion will average about 522 over the project period, which is
satisfactory.
4.13      T&T is expected to generate internally all necessary funds to
cover the local costs of its FY87-90 investment expenditures. During
negotiations, assurances were obtained that in each year, self generated
cash, as a percentage of the rolling average of the local currency
requirements of the investment program for the current year and subsequent
year, shall not be less than 100%. However, with its current status as a
government department, T&T can use its internally generated funds only up
to the budgetary ceiling established by GOP annually. To avoid delays in
project execution due to budgetary constraints, assurances were obtained
from GOP during negotiations that sufficient funds will be made available
to T&T to implement the complete fou. year investment program, subject to
annual review with the Bank by April 1 of each year (para 2.06). In
addition, full approval by ECNEC of all PC-1 documents is required as a
condition of loan effectiveness.

investment program of which the proposed Bank-assisted project (FY87-90) is
an integral part.
Role of Telecommunications in the Economy
4.15      The necessity for adequate lines of communication given the
distances and difficult topography separating the population centers, and
the wide dispersion of administration, agriculture and industry highlight
the need for adequate telecommunications facilities in Pakistan. Many
essential social services involve the use of staff with limited expertise
who may have to obtain advice or direction from more qualified individuals
at the main centers. By providing a means of rapid communication,
telecommunications forms part of the basic infrastructure required for
national development and for ensuring effective use of available resources
and expertise.
4.16      Further expansion of the industrial sector involves the
coordination of a series of activities which are highly dependent on
adequate telecomnunications facilities. Since a large part of the
population is dependent on agriculture for its livelihood, adequate
telecommunications are of high priority to arrange sales, purchase, and
timely delivery of agricultural products and inputs.
Least Cost Solution
4.17      The dimensioning and timing of the major works included in the
project are based on engineering studies which were carried out by T&T to
determine the least cost solution for each component. Individual exchanges
have been dimensioned using standard analytical techniques and provisioning
periods to maximize economies of scale. Within the context of the overall
program and the provision for local network expansion under ongoing works,
the project is the best compromise given the known priorities and the new
digital switching technology adopted by T&T.
Distribution of Program Benefits
4.18      It is difficult to establish actual telephone usage by subscriber
category, as no differentiation is made in T&T's data between government,
business and private subscribers but in other developing countries, about
50% of working telephone lines are residential, 30% business and 20%
government. The high revenues per subscriber line, however, indicate heavy
business and government use of existing facilities. The majority of long
distance, nationwide dialing, international and telex facilities in T&T's
investment program (para 2.03), will benefit business and government
subscribers. However, the provision under the program of new subsidiary
routes, rural exchanges and PCOs will mainly benefit the populations of
currently unserviced rural areas.

Fiscal Impact
4.19      Since FY76, T&T's internal cash generation, before retention by
Government, has fully covered its requirements for operation and expansion
of the telecommunications network and produced substantial fiscal surpluses
for GOP. The net fiscal surplus for the FY75-81 period was about PRs 2,600
million. During the project period (FY87-90), T&T is expected to generate
a fiscal surplus for government of about PRs 10 billion (US$600 million).
Subsequently, traffic increases resulting from the Fifth Project are
expected to result in substantial higher resource mobilization thereafter.
Additional potential exists for increased mobilization of resources through
efficiency gains (due to institutional improvements) and higher tariffs.
Tariff Policies
4.20      A summary of T&T's current tariffs, which have remained basically
unchanged since 1980, although GOP recently announced a very small increase
In the local call fee effective July 1, 1986, is given in Annex 15. A
tariff review in 1983 under the Fourth Project focussed on a comparison of
tariff rates with other countries, and failed to review comprehensively the
structure of T&T's rates. However, monthly rental fees for telex were
increased by about 20% in March 1984 as a result of this review. Although
this review recognized the necessity for differential rates for off-peak
traffic and STD long distance calls (versus operator assisted calls), such
changes can only be introduced following the installation of toll ticketing
equipment and additional transmission capacity under the ongoing project.
The timing of overall tariff increases should be considered In the context
of the broader discussion of domestic resource mobilization once the
quality of service has improved. Given the substantial economic benefits
arising from optimization of system use from an appropriate tariff
structure, the proposed Economic Sub-unit, to be established within T&T
(para 2.11) will review the tariff structure: (a) with terms of reference
satisfactory to the Bank to be agreed by September 30, 1986; (b) review the
progress of the study with the Bank not later than March 31, 1987; (c)
submit the final study to the Bank not later than December 31, 1987; (d)
discuss the study recommendations with the Bank and apprise the Bank not
later than March 31, 1988 of its tariff restructuring measures and a
timetable to implement them.
4.21      T&T's collection rates for international calls have not been
increased since 1979. Following devaluation of the rupee since January
1981, customer billing rates for international calls are now about 30%
below the accounting rates used for payment to foreign administration by
T&T. T&T has thus been passlng up a relatively painless opportunity to
increase revenue from outgoing international calls. Furthermore, T&T's
currently favorable foreign exchange balance (estimated at $70 million per
annum) on international traffic is likely to be reduced if collection rates
are allowed to remain well below their corresponding accounting rates.
Consequently, during negotiations, it was agreed that GOP will cause T&T



- 27 -
not later than December 31, 1986, and periodically thereafter, to adjust
Its billlng rate for international calls so as to produce revenue equal to
that which would be produced by using the accounting rates.
Return on Investment
4.22      The rate of return calculations are based on the entire FY84-90
T&T Investment program (paras 2.01-2.02). On the basis of projected
incremental expenditures and revenues generated from the increased numbers
of working telephone and telex lines and from reduced long distance and
international call congestion, the financial rate of return of the FY84-90
program is about 19%. After adjustment for customs duties and the
application of a standard conversion factor of 0.90 to local costs and
benefits, the program's economic rate of return is 22% (Annex 16). These
rates of return understate the benefits from the Investment program since
no attempt has been made to estimate the consumer surplus for new
subscribers or increases in consumer surplus for existing subscribers due
to quality improvements. Furthermore, some equipment installed under the
program could handle substantially higher traffic volumes with inexpensive
additional Investments, but no such additional revenues have been
incorporated in the rate of return calculations.
Risk
4.23      Due to the large unsatisfied demand for telecommunications
services, the project offers no significant risk resulting from a possible
reduction in economic activity. The technology to be introduced, while
quite advanced, has been well tested in other countries, including some
with comparable environmental conditions. However, the fundamental risk is
that the institutional and implementation capacity of T&T may not be
sufficient to execute the project as proposed. Concern for this risk was
the primary consideration in project preparation and appraisal, and is
reflected in the project design. The management and operational reforms,
supported by the monitoring of performance indicators, extensive training,
and technical assistance, are all intended to reduce this risk.
4.24      A sensitivity analysis on the economic rate of return of the
Investment program (22%) indicates that a comblnation of 20% higher capital
expenditures, 20% higher operating costs, 20% lower revenues and a two-year
delay in project benefits would result in an internal economic rate of
return of about 14%.   An analysis of switching values at 11%, the oppor-
tunity cost of capital in Pakistan, indicates that for the project's net
present value to become zero either: (a) capital costs must increase by
131%; (b) operating costs must increase by 292%; or (c) revenues must fall
by 42%.

Environmental and Health Aspects
4.25      No adverse environmental or health effects are expected from the
project. The use of telecommunications tends to promote energy conserva-
tion and reduce environmental pollution to the extent that it substitutes
for transportation. The project also offers health and social advantages
In making scarce expertise available for consultation over a wider area and
by improving arrangements for health delivery and emergency care.
V.   CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
5.01      During negotiations agreements have been reached on the
following:
(a)  GOP will make available to T&T sufficient funds to
implement the total investment plan and to meet operating

Planning Unit will undertake traffic measurements and
design proper traffic engineering to ensure optimal
network usage (para 2.11);
(g) T&T will modernize and expand its training and research
program. T&T will be assisted by ITU and, for training
policy purposes, other consultants with qualifications
and experience satisfactory to the Bank whose terms of
reference will be furnished to the Bank for approval not
later than October 31, 1986, and will be employed not
later than March 31, 1987 (para 3.06);
(h) once the changes in the legal status of T&T have been
decided upon, GOP will discuss with the Bank the
mechanism, timetable and technical assistance required to
implement the changes (para 2.10); and
(i) Government receivables will be reduced to 150 days of
billing by June 30, 1987 and 90 days of billing by June
30, 1988 (para 3.12).
5.02      The following finai.cial covenants have been agreed upon during
negotiations:
(a) unaudited accounts will be submitted to the Bank within
six months of the end of FY87 and the corresponding audit
report within six months thereafter; this will be
decreased to five months each in FY88, and to four months
each thereafter (para 3.09);
(b) T&T will maintain a rate of return of at least 10% on net
revalued fixed assets in operation (para 4.10);
(c) in each year, self generated cash, as a percentage of the
rolling average of the local currency requirements of the
investment program for the current year and subsequent
year will not be less than 100% and T&T will review, not
later than April 1 of each fiscal year, whether it has
met and will meet this requirement for such fiscal year
and the next following fiscal year (para 4.12); and
(d) T&T shall not later than December 31, 1986, and
periodically thereafter, to adjust its billing rate for
international calls so as to produce revenue equal to not
less than that which would be produced at accounting rate
(para 4.21).
5.03      Conditions of loan effectiveness are that (a) 20% of the amounts
due to T&T from Government for services as of June 30, 1985 has been paid



- 30 -
(para 3.12); (b) full approval of all PC-1 documents has been obtained from
ECNEC (para 4.13); (c) a contract for direct import of digital switching
equipment for 50,000 local lines and 25,000 nationwide dialing lines has
been executed (para 2.07); and (d) a letter of intent for construction and
installation of a digital switching equipment manufacturing plant and
related transfer of technology has been issued (para 2.07).
5.04      Subject to agreement on the above, the proposed project provides
a suitable basis for a Bank loan of $100 million for a term of 20 years
including a grace period of 5 years.

components of the project by end June 1988, and (c) Bank financed
consultants are expected to be in position by end June 1987.

PAKISTAN
PAKISTAW TELEGRAPH AND TELEPHONE DEPARTHENT (T&T)
FIFTH TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
Draft Terms of Reference for Units to be Established Within T&T
General
1.        T&T has set a target density of four telephones per 100 popula-
tion by the turn of the century. While these targets are reasonable, they
translate into a growth rate of 15 percent per year and imply a doubling of
T&T's investment program and capacity every five years.1/ By the year
2000, the total number of telephone lines would be of the order of 5
million, T&T would be responsible for managing assets valued at about $8-10
billion in 1984 prices, and would have an annual investment budget of $1.5
billion with annual revenues of the order of $2.5 billion.
2.        In order to achieve these targets and to operate such a system
efficiently, T&T will require a different institutional structure. In May
1985 GOP created a Deregulation Commission to make recommendations on,
inter alia, establishment of autonomous corporation for telecommunication.
The Commission, headed by the Governor of the State Bank of Pakistan
recently submitted its recommendations on the future legal status of T&T to
the Finance Minister. However, GOP has not yet taken any decision in this
respect. Whatever the decision might be on the status of T&T, GOP and T&T
are firmly committed to the improvements of T&T's organization, management
and efficiency. New institutional framework and procedures need to be
developed and programs are required to train suitable qualified manpower to
operate the system with its more sophisticated technologies. New operation
and maintenance procedures are required to upgrade and maintain the quality
of service. Financial management techniques and tariff levels and
structures will have to be reviewed to generate sufficient revenues and
ensure optimal use of the facilities. Specific financial instruments
within a general strategy, must be identified to mobilize the required
foreign and local resources to finance this expansion.
3.        In order to assist in these institutional changes, T&T has
already created a Fundamental Planning Unit as recommended by the Bank's
appraisal mission. T&T will expand the role of this Unit to include beside
the technical planning, long term financial planning and human resource
development planning. T&T will also establish an Economic Sub-unit and a
Traffic Engineering Sub-unit within the Unit. Terms of reference for these
units will be as follows:
1/ Such a phone density would still be relatively low compared to other
countries with similar projected per capita incomes and the
inadequacies of the network would still impose significant constraints
to development.

Fundamental Planning Unit
4.        This unit will consist of professionals representing a broad
range of technical, economic, financial, and planning skills and will be
assisted by local and internationally recruited experts. The main task of
the unit, with the help of outside expertise when necessary, will be to:
(i) revise and update T&T's Master Plan, with specific emphasis on
items relevant to the introduction of the digital technology in the
network.  This should include:
- Routing Plan
- Transmission Plan
- Numbering Plan
- Signalling Plan
- Synchronization Plan
- Call charging Plan, and
- Other plans (Traffic management plan, Service quality
management plan, O&M concept, etc.).
(ii) to define a strategv to introduce digital technology in the
present analogue T&T network for both switching and transmission fields, in
order to use the new system features offered by SPC digital switching and
transmission systems. This should include:
- Concentration of SPC exchanges in big multi-exchange areas in
order to maximize the benefit of O&M;
- Reconfiguration and optimization of multi-exchange area
according to the adopted strategy; and
- Reconfiguration and optimization of the long distance network
and measures toward consolidation and integration of manual,
STD, NWD and the emerging digital networks.
(iii) to introduce modern planning principles, methods and tools and
prepare guidelines for the planning of local cable networks, dropwire,
primary, secondary and junction cables, local and tandem switching
equipment, long distance network, telex, data and computer networks. to
ensure the harmonious and balanced development of the local and long
distance network.
(iv) to prepare plans to replace old wornout equipment and materials to
ensure that in approximately five years the existing outside network will
be replaced and/or overhauled to improve quality of services; as necessary
its technical characteristics checked and brought to acceptable standards
so that a fault rate on the outside network will not be higher than 20
fault per 100 subs/month in 1988/1989. Plans should be prepared so that
old F-i electromechanical exchanges should be replaced in a period of 5-7
years and the traffic handling capacity of the remaining electromechanical
exchanges should be improved to provide acceptable service quality. Plans
should be prepared so that the quality of the outside plant including the
subscriber instruments and particularly the dropwire subscriber section
will be checked and deficiencies corrected in order to achieve satisfactory
quality of service.



ANNEX 8
- 41 -                       Page 3 of 5
(v) to develop a set of performance indicators to serve as overall
benchmarks to measure TT&T's performance. The indicators shall measure,
inter alia, the number of telephone exchanges, installed exchange capacity,
number of lines, circuits and public call offices, complaint, fault and
completion ratios, staff ratios, operator answering time, training volume,
average bill collection periods and revenues and expenditures per DEL. GOP
and T&T have agreed with the Bank on tentative indicators for all four
years of the project and definite targets for the first year. T&T should
analyse, in its half-yearly reports due June I and December 1, its
performance vis-a-vis the agreed indicators and will annually reach
agreement with the Bank before April 1 of each fiscal year, on targets,
monitoring and necessary corrective measures for the subsequent years.
(vi) to define T&T's human resource development policy and make plans
to meet T&T's personnel and training requirements. To a large extent,
T&T's ability to transform itself into a strong, independent institution
will depend on recruitment and motivation of appropriate, qualified
personnel. While the introduction of digital technology will permit
substantial reductions in the ratio of staff to telephones, it will also
require highly skilled personnel. Existing training capacity is underused
because of a staff perception that training is not relevant to their work,
and the facilities and courses are inappropriate for T&Ts's future needs.
(vii) to devise a medium- and long-term financial plan for T&T, taking
into account the results of the studies of the Economic Sub-unit referred
to in paragraph 6 below. The plan shall provide for T&T's future financing
with a view to achieving balanced growth of the system over time, taking
into account projected capital investments and working capital requirements
based on realistic assumptions of future demand and availability of
resources, both domestic and foreign.
5.        The Unit should coordinate its activities with the new manufac-
turing organization of digital exchanges and its foreign collaborator.
Terms of reference for the consultants to assist the Unit should be
furnished to the Bank by October 31, 1986 and consultants should be
employed by March 31, 1987.
The Economic Sub-unit
6.        The Economic Sub-unit will be established within the Fundamental
Planning Unit to assist the Unit in devising a mediumr- and long-term
financial plan for T&T.  The establishment of the Sub-unit was recommended
by Bank staff during appraisal to conduct economic studies for the tariff
structure review and assist T&T in subproject evaluation.  Given the
importance of tariff policy as a means of making efficient use of existing
telecomminications facilities, the Sub-unit will assist T&T in generating
the parameters required for formulating pricing strategies. A desirable
tool for planning the appropriate level and structure of tariffs is an
analysis of demand and usage of telephone and telex services by type of
service, user, location, and time of day. A satisfactory tariff study
should also include an analysis of the cost structure and supply
constraints on T&T services as well as the financial requirements of T&T.



ANNEX 8
-42 -                        Page 4 of 5
Such an analysis would also provide an important basis for the planning of
network expansions. Furthermore, a tariff study would also examine the
equity issues involved in the pricing of telecommunications services, for
example, the difference between call charges for local charges for
subscribers who are connected to exchanges with toll-ticketing and STD
facilities as compared to those connected to exchanges without these
capabilities. Thus the study will focus on cost accounting, a demand
assessment, and financial analysis to assess the adequacy of revenues
generated from the point of view of financial viability. It is also
assumed that marginal cost pricing, with the constraint that overall
revenue generation must be sufficient to ensure financial viability of the
entity, will be adopted for an appropriate tariff structure.
7.        The purpose of cost accounting analysis is to identify the
marginal costs of the principal services offered, distinguishing between
the major metropolitan artas and oLner regions.  It will identify the costs
of: (a) provision of telephone connection; (b) local calls; (c) long
distance calls; and (e) the same subcategories for telex.
8.        The bases of the calculations will be:  (a) financial accounts of
the enterprise; (b) operating records of the enterprise; (c) spot-checks
to establish on a sample basis the marginal costs of particular services;
and (d) relevant data available from other telecommunications administra-
tions. It is expected that these studies will be carried out by the staff
of the Sub-unit with very little support needed by outside consultants.
9.        The purpose of the demand assessment is to assess the strengths
of demand for each of the different services offered by the telecommunica-
tions entity, and the sensitivity of that demand to the prices which might
be charged. This is needed for two purposes: (a) in order to estimate the
cost to users (or potential users) of doing without the service, for cases
where it is not possible to meet demand fully; and (b) in order to identify
those services with least elastic demand which should be made to bear the
major part of any mark-up necessary to cover overhead and enable the
telecommunications entity to attain overall financial viability.
10.       This task will require a thorough review of existing records on
applications for service, calling rates, ineffective calls, followed by
surveys of a sample of existing and potential users in order to evaluate
the strength of demand for the different services and of the amounts that
customers would be prepared to pay for the different services (or that they
would suffer as losses, or extra expenses, if the services were not
available).
11.       Attention must be given, in connection with the demand assess-
ment, to the possible need to charge certain users,such as those in distant
rural areas, or public call offices, at rates below those that indicated by
marginal cost and financial viability considerations, in order to stimulate
socially highly desirable use. Certain limited cross-subsidization of this
nature may be a worthwhile means of bringing telecommunications facilities
within the reach of poorer people who would otherwise be excluded. These
demand assessments are likely to require some considerable support of
consultants.



- 43 -                           ANNEX 8
Page 5 of 5
12.       In the financial analysis the approximate tariffs for the differ-
ent services (some of which may well turn out to need to be cost-based
while others may need to be more demand-based) must then be multiplied by
estimated levels of service requirements to assess total revenues. These
should be compared with updated projections of cost, to assess the future
financial status of the enterprise.
13.       Iterations may be required to produce a structure of tariffs that
is consistent with financial viability. The results of these studies
should be a recommended set of prices for the various services. Recommen-
dations should also be made concerning how tariffs should be adjusted over
time in light of changes in costs, including inflation. T&T will require
the services of consultants to assist in carrying out these financial
studies.
14.       The Economic Sub-unit will also assist T&T in evaluating the
economic and financial viability of its subprojects. These assessments are
part of the process of completing PC-1 forms for each project as required
by the Planning Commission. The input of the Economics Cell in these
areas should improve the quality of that analysis. More importantly, it
would represent an important step in the integration of finance and
economics with T&T network planning.
15.       The scope of the tariff structure review and the terms of
reference for the studies included in it should be agreed with the Bank not
later than September 30, 1986. T&T should review the proress of the study
with the Bank not later than March 31, 1987 and submit the final study to
GOP and the Bank not later than December 31, 1987. GOP should discuss the
study recommendations with the Bank and should apprise the Bank not later
than March 31, 1988 of its tariff restructuring measures and a timetable to
implement them.
The Traffic Engineering Sub-unit
16.       In order to economically utilize the installed assets,  T&T will
also establish a Traffic Engineering Sub-unit within the Fundemantal
Planning Unit and equip it with the necessary traffic measuring equipment.
The group should plan, execute and study traffic measurements and through
proper traffic engineering ensure optimal usage of the network thereby
increasing T&Ts's revenue. The result of the studies should be transferred
to the planning department to improve planning for network optimization.

PAKISTAN
TELEGRAPH AND TELEPHONE DEPARTMENT (T&T)
FIFTH TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
Notes and Assumptions on T&T Financial Statements
1.        Figures for FY85 are based on T&T provisional estimates.
The projections for subsequent years are based on the following
assumptions:
Income Statement
2.        Telephone rental charges are projected on the basis of the
average number of telephone subscribers and FY85 average rental fees per
subscriber.
3.        Call charges include charges for local and automatic long
distance calls and are projected on the basis of the average number of
DELs and FY85 average revenues per DEL. Average revenues per DEL are
expected Lo remain constant for FY86 and FY87 and increase by 10% per
annum for FY88 onwards due to the increased traffic handling capacity
which will be installed under the project in service by FY88.
4.        International telephone revenues are projected to increase by
20Z each year, due to the completion of the type A earth satellite
station and new long distance routes which will facilitate international
Lraffic.
5.        Installation fees are projected based on the number of
subscribers to be connected at an installation fee of PRs 2,000 per
subscriber.
6.        Telegraph revenues are expected to remain costant as from FY85
since increased traffic will be handled by new telex facilities.
7.        Telex revenues are projected on the basis of the average
number of working telex lines and FY85 average telex revenues per
line. No increase in traffic per subscriber has been considered due to
the projected sharp increase in number of subscribers.
8.        Operating costs for operation and administration, mainly
wages, are expected to increase reflecting the expansion in the number
of staff although staff per 1,000 telephones are expected to decline
over the project according to the performance indicator on the staff
ratio. Projections include the effect of inflation as well.

ANNEX I 1
Page 2 of 3
9.        Maintenance cost projections are based on Lhe FY85 average
maintenance cost per line and projected exchange capacity. It is
expected that Lhe average maintenance cost per line will Increase aL Lhe
rate of inflation for FY86 and FY87. From FY88 onward, the cost per
line is projected to hold constant in current terms due to the
replacement of 75,000 lines of the most obselete equipment and the
520,000 line expansion using modern electronic exchange equipment which
require less maintenance.
10.       Depreciation has been calculated at the rate of 5% per year
for revalued fixed assets in oparation.
11.       Interest has been projected at the rate of 132 on average
outstanding long-term debt for the year.
12.       An extra-ordinary item of PRs 461.1 million in FY83 has been
booked as a retroactive adjustment of the net amount outstanding in
favor of Pakistan vis-a-vis foreign telephone adminilstrations for
overseas (incoming and outgoing) calls. From FY84 these r.!venues will
be included in international call revenues.
13.       Government appropriation includes retroactive adjustments for
accumulated interest on foreign loans which had been overstated by the
accumuilated of interest under current liabilities. Transfer to the
Government Consolidated Fund ceased as from FY81 with the establishment
of the T&T Fund, which is shown as an asset in the balance sheet. Since
neither the exact amount of the Government equity nor the return on that
equity has been defined, a provisional retroactive adjustment of PRs
1,500.0 million has been made in FY84 and included in Government
appropriation. Return to Government, an annual return of 50% on
operating income after interest payments, has been projected from FY87.
This is the corporate tax rate for non-exempt public corporations. This
assumption will be modified once the government equity issue is
resolved.
Balance Sheet
14.      MT's fixed assets in operation have been revalued from FY83 on
the basis of the estimated replacement cost of exchange lines
installed. The average life of exchange lines is estimated to be 20
years. Projections are based on the FY84 replacement cost estimated by
T&T and increases of 6% p.a. thereafter. This is expected to reflect
future replacement cost of fixed assets in services.
15.       Work in progress is expected to equal the current years'
capital expenditures (e.g., works are on average completed within one
and a half years).

ANNEX 11
Page 3 of 3
16.       Accounts receivable for domestic services  are projected to
decline over the projection period from 3.8 months of billing in FY85 to
2.6 months in FY91. Accounts receivables for international services are
projected to decline from 7.2 months of revenues in FY85 to 6.5 months
In FY86 onwards.
17.       Inventories are assumed to increase by only IO0  per year
taking into consideration that less spares for maintenance will be
required for new assets.
18.       Accounts payable and others (excluding PRs 1,500 million which
is payable to the Government for retroactive return for FY81-83 on its
equity investment in T&T) are assumed to increase by 10% per annum. The
retroactive return of PRs 1,500 milllon is projected to be paid to the
Government in FY87.
Funds Flow Statement
19.       As from FY87, T&T is expected to start repaying long-term
loans Government over ten years, with no grace period.

TELEGRAPH AND TELEPHONE DEPARTMENT (T&T)
FIFTH TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
Return on Investment
1.        T&T FY84-90 investment program includes ongolng works from
previous projects, investments in FY84 and FY85 and the proposed Fifth
Telecommunications Project. The close interrelation between the FY84 and
FY85 investments and the Fifth Project makes arbitrary any attempt to
separate incremental costs and revenues between the project and nonproject
components of the program. The rate of return calculations are, therefore,
based on the entire FY84-90 T&T investment program.
2.        All components for the rate of return calculations are expressed
in PRs at FY86 constant purchaslng power. Fu,e this purpose, nominal values
of incremental cost and revenue streams have been deflated by 7.8% in FY87,
7.5% in FY88, 7.3% in FY89, 7.0Z in FY90, and 5.5% in FY91. For FY91
onwards, incremental cost and revenue streams are assumed to remain
constant.
3.        The benefit period extends from FY86 to FY07, when on average the
equipment provided under the program is expected to have substantially
completed its useful life. No residual values of programmed investments
have been taken into account as the FY86 present value would be
insignificant.
4.        Incremental revenue estimates are based on FY85 tariff levels (no
tariff increase is projected under the project period) and projected
increase in numbers of telephone and telex subscribers and consequent
traffic increases attributable to the program. T&T's telecommunications
facilities are currently so congested that no significant traffic increase
can be handled without new investments. The incremental operating cost
estimates are based on additional assets and traffic generated under the
program, excluding depreciation and interest.
5.        A summary of cost and revenue streams at FY86 purchasing power
is given below in PRs million:
Capital       Incremental Operation
FY            Expenditure      Costs         Revenues
84                1,935.7
85                1,689.7
86                1,704.6        53.7          375.1
87                3,290.0       106.1          662.1
88                3,513.5       203.7        1,497.8
89                3,276.2       278.7        2,548.8
90                1,607.1      478.4         3,756.0
91-07                          678.7         4,592.4
The above cost and revenue streams result in a financial rate
of return of 19.1%.



54 -                   ANNEX 16
Page 2 of 2
6.        The economic rate of return was calculated by: (i) excluding 45%
customs duties on imported goods, (ii) applying a conversion factor of 0.9
to all other local costs (operating and local capital costs) and to local
revenues. The economic rate of return has been estimated to be 22.0%.
This rate should be regarded as the minimum economic rate of return
because:
(a) no attempt has been made to estimate the consumer
surplus for new subscribers or increase in
consumer surplus for existing subscribers when
telephone tariffs decrease in real terms and the
quality of service is improved; and
(b) no increase in net revenues after FY91 has been
attributed to the FY84-90 investment program.
Some of the equipment to be installed has,
however, ample spare capacity and could handle
substantially higher traffic volume with
inexpensive marginal investments. Therefore, the
full benefits of the FY84-90 investment program
will not be achieved before facilities are
expanded under subsequent programs.
7.        A sensitivity analysis of the economic rate of return was
performed with the following results:
Rate of Return
(a)  20 percent increase in capital expenditures              19.6%
(b)  20 percent increase in operating cost                    21.4%
(c)  20 percent decrease in revenues                          17.2%
-d) Two-year delay in project benefits                        20.8%
Ce)  Combination of (a), (b), (c) and (d) above               13.7%
