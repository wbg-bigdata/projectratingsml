MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT:   Project Completion Report on Pakistan
Fifth Telecommunications Project (Loan 2743-PAK)
Attached is the Project Completion Report (PCR) on the Pakistan: Fifth Telecommunications
project (Loan 2743-PAK, approved in FY87) prepared by the South Asia Regional Office, with Part II
prepared by the Borrower.
The objectives of this fifth Bank operation in Pakistan's telecommunications sector, for which a
Bank loan of US$100 million was approved in 1986, were to support: (i) the rapid expansion of the
network; and (ii) institutional improvements aimed at increasing the autonomy and efficiency of the
country's telecommunications agency (T&T). All of the project's physical objectives were either met or
exceeded. albeit with some delays due to initial procurement bottlenecks; telephone density was almost
tripled between 1986 and 1993. The project 's institutional objectives were fully achieved as T&T was
corporatized in 1991, and sector finances have remained strong all along. The project's technical assistance
components (including staff training and studies in the areas of information systems, tariffs and network
planning and operation) were satisfactorily carried out and helped the sector achieve significant efficiency
gains.
Accordingly, the outcome of the project is rated as highly satisfactory, its institutional
development as high and its sustainabillity as likely. Both Borrower and Bank performance were fully
satisfactory. The PCR is both concise and of excellent quality.
No audit is planned at this time.

FWTH TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
(LOAN 2743-PAK)
PREFACE
1.     This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Fifth Telecommunications Project in
Pakistan, for which a Loan 2743-PAK in the amount of US$100.0 million was approved on July 22,
1986. The loan was closed on December 31, 1993 after three years of extensions. The last disbursement
was on April 1, 1994 and an undisbursed amount of about US$1.9 million was canceled.
2.     This PCR was prepared jointly by the Energy and Infrastructure Operations Division, Country
Department 3, South Asia Region (Parts I and I), and the Borrower (Part II).
3.     The preparation of this PCR was started in December 1993 and is based, inter alia, on the Staff
Appraisal Report, the Loan Agreement, Supervision Reports, correspondence between the Bank and the
Borrower, and internal Bank memoranda.

FIFT TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
(LOAN 2743-PAK)
EVALUAION SUMMARY
Objectives
The project was designed to include the entire investment program (except for ongoing works and
start up investment for a subsequent plan) for the Pakistan's Telegraph and Telephone (T&T) Department
over FY86-90. It covered the expansion of the network and services at local, long distance and international
levels and strengthening of the operational capacity of T&T, as well as rural access to telecommunications
services, nationwide dialling and international facilities. The main project objectives were to facilitate
economic and social development and improve the operating efficiency of T&T.
Imlementation Experience
The start up of the project procurement was delayed due to changes in techncal requirements.
Project implementation was further delayed by T&Ts lack of autonomy and administrative efficiency as a
govermment department and the disruptions caused by its conversion into the Pakistan Telecommunictions
Corporation (PTC) in 1991. After its formation, PTC's implementation of works accelerated considerably
and new projects were added to the investment program (e.g., various BLT schemes in 1992-93 for 500,000
lines).
Results
The conversion of the T&T Department into the PTC corporation in 1991 was a substantial
institutional improvement. The installation of a 2,036-km fiber optic cable along the Indus River, from
Rawalpindi to Karachi, is perhaps the most outstanding physical component of the project. It provides a
modem, high-capacity backbone to the entire long-distance telecommunications network at a lower cost than
originally estimated for a system of half the capacity. T&T/PTC also installed about 1.1 million lines in the
period 1986-93, mostly after 1991. In spite of unprecedented expansion in a relatively short period, which
caused bottlenecks in the system, PTC was able to substantially improve service quality. However, further
progress is needed before PTC can meet customer expectation.
On the whole, the project was highly satisfactory despite implementation delays. On the
institutional side, the T&T Department was converted into the PTC corporation with substantial gains in
operating efficiency. T&Ts corporatization and the Bank's dialogue with Government on this matter led to
an acceleration of sector reform and, more recently, to PTC's privatization.
Some major indicators of T&Ts (or PTC's after 1991) performance from 1986 to 1993 are
summarized in the table below.

SustainabilitY
The project has provided PTC with a modern fiber optic long-distance network with substantial
spare capacity that will allow the profitable LD traffic to increase at marginal investment costs. Sector
reform was also initiated under the project with substantial improvements in operating efficiency. The
most recent move towards PTC's privatization should ensure that this trend continues. On the whole,
project results are most likely to be sustained or improved over the foreseeable future.
Findings and Lessons Learned
The main lessons learned under the project are:
(a)   the conversion of government department into a corporation takes more work and time
than generally expected. In addition to disruptions and project implementation delays,
the inventory and valuation of assets and liabilities to be taken over by the new entity
may substantially delay-the completion of its opening financial statements;
(b)    a higher degree of financial and operational autonomy will lead to more efficient
operations and this will be reflected in the performance indicators for satisfaction of
demand, service quality, and operating efficiency;
(c)    TA to maintain proper project cost accounts, especially for local costs, should be
provided under the project to enable adequate cost benefit analysis; and
(d)    PTC's corporatization and the Bank's dialogue with GOP in this matter accelerated
further sector restructuring, e.g. market liberalization (private cellular operators, etc.)
and, more recently, the privatization of PTC.

FIFTH TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
(Loan 2743-PAK)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PART I: PROJECT REVIEW FROM THE BANK'S PERSPECTIVE
Project Identity
Name:               Fifth Telecomnunications Project
Loan Number:        2743-PAK
RVP Unit:           South Asia Region
Country:            Pakistan
Sector:             Infrastructure
Subsector:          Telecommunications
Background
1.    The telecommunications sector, including the provision of domestic and international telephone,
telegraph and telex services, was managed and controlled by the Telegraph and Telephone (T&T)
Department of the Federal Ministry of Communicationis. The Pakistan Telecommunications Corporation
(PTC) was established in 1991 and assumed the responsibility to provide these services. The military,
police, railways and other agencies operate separate networks for their own use. Since 1990, the
Government has licensed private operators for cellular mobile, paging, data transmission, and card
payphone services as part of a policy to liberalize the sector. Under the authority of the Ministry of
Communications (MOC), the Telephone Industries of Pakistan (TIP) and Carrier Telephone Industries
(CTI) manufacture telecommnunications equipment in joint venture with Siemens AG of Germany.
2.    The Government, recognizing the critical role of telecommunications for the development of the
Pakistani economy, embarked on an ambitious program to expand and improve services under the Sixth
Five Year Plan (FY 84-88). The main objectives for the sector were to:
(a)   improve T&T's operational and managerial efficiency and its quality of service;
(b)    expand the telephone network by 520,000 lines, thus raising density from 0.6 to 0.9
Direct Exchange Lines (DELs) per 100 population by the end of FY 88;
(c)    extend local and long distance facilities to areas with the highest demand and revenue per
line, taking into account the requirements of agriculture, industry, and administrative and
social services;
(d)    expand and improve the international, telex and telegraph networks;
(e)   introduce modern technology and standards and to develop domestic manufacturing
facilities;
(f)   study the feasibility of converting the T&T Department into a self-financed independent



2
corporation; and
(g)    encourage the participation of the private sector in teleconmnunications development.
3.    In 1985, GOP requested the Bank to finance a Fifth Telecommunications Project in support of
the sector development under the Sixth Five Year Plan.
Project Objectives and DescriDtion
4.    Project Objectives. The Project was to support the national objectives for the sector as established
in the Sixth Five Year Plan. In addition to meeting part of the demand by expansion of the
telecommunications network, it would address, in particular, T&T's institutional and inefficiencies such
as poor quality of service to the customers.
5.    Project Description. The major Project components were:
(a)    provision of local network facilities for an additional exchange capacity of about 400,000
lines;
(b)    expansion of the long distance network to an additional 94 towns, and provision of about
9,000 new transmission channels;
(c)    continued modernization and improvement of telegraph and telex services by increasing
the telex exchange capacity by about 11,800 lines and extending telex and telegraph
facilities to smaller towns;
(d)    provision of new international teleconmnunications channels;
(e)   replacement of obsolete and worn out cable and exchange equipment (75,000 lines), open
wire carrier systems, and trunk positions;
(f)   improvement of T&T's organizational structure and management systems to enhance its
operational efficiency, productivity, quality of service, and planning capabilities;
(g)    economic studies and analyses of T&T's operations, investment program and tariff
structure; and
(h)    modernization and expansion of T&T's training and research facilities.
Project Design and Oraanization
6.    At the time of project appraisal, T&T had gained adequate experience in project implementation
under previous Bank supported projects. However, the complex installations and new technology to be
introduced under the project required special assistance and supervision of the contractors and suppliers
and the subcontracting of cable installation with private firms. The project also aimed at focusing T&T'
middle management on a series of performance indicators to monitor performance and establishing an
information system for senior management. Under the Fifth Project, with KfW funding, and ITU
technical assistance, T&T was to engage consultants for the optimization of its urban telephone network,



3
switching and transmission maintenance, and training in new technologies.
7.    Major organizational changes were also considered necessary for T&T to efficiently manage a
network to be very substantially expanded under the project. An initial step toward T&T strengthening
was the establishment of a Fundamental Planning Unit with an Economic Sub-unit and a Traffic
Engineering Sub-unit. A further step was the conversion of T&T into the PTC corporation. The basic
project design was maintained during its implementation.
Project Implementation
8.    Loan Effectiveness and Proiect Start-uR. The project was appraised in September 1984 and
presented to the Board in July 1986, and the loan was made effective in November 1986 (Table 11-2).
The delays were due to difficulties in determining project cofinancing, the Bank's insistence on adequate
autonomy for T&T, and to procurement issues. Under a "type B" loan, the Bank was to join a syndicate
of commercial banks to provide quick disbursing funds to be applied against any eligible project
expenditure, including local costs. The B-loan was finally removed from the project financing plan. As
a condition for effectiveness, it was agreed that Government would sign a contract for off-the-shelf digital
switching equipment and a letter of intent for the remaining equipment, establishment of an assembly
plant, and transfer of technology. Although the switching equipment was not to be financed by the Bank,
the selection of a supplier as a condition of effectiveness was considered critical to the progress of the
entire project. On the institutional side, the measuresthat the Govermment adopted went beyond what was
originally proposed by the Bank.
9.    Implementation Schedule. The project components financed by the Bank were originally
scheduled to be completed by June 30, 1990. Most of the installation and construction activities were
actually completed by mid-1992 and some only by mid-1993. The main reasons for the delays are (i) a
slow start-up of procurement and (ii) difficulties in the acceptance of the LD fiber optic transmission
system. Most of the contracts were signed 2-3 years after the loan effective date, including two contracts
for technical assistance for the Fundamental Planning Unit and the System Engineering Unit and the
contract for the supply and construction of the LD fiber optic system. Further delays were caused by
problems in establishing the letter of credit, significant design and quantity changes, and discrepancies
with the contractor for the testing and acceptance of the system. These were only resolved a year after
the system was ready for commissioning. The 1991 restructuring of the T&T Department into a
corporation and the introduction of new administrative requirements (e.g., import licenses)contributed to
implementation delays.
10.   The delays experienced in the installation of the fiber optic cable system are indicative of the type
of problems encountered by PTC in project implementation. In addition to the start-up delays, the
following factors delayed project completion from April 1991 to June 1993: (a) a 4-month delay in the
commencement of works due to the holding up of cable at Karachi Port because of the imposition of local
taxes on PTC goods (since T&T, as a GOP department, was exempted from such taxes, no budget
provision had been made); (b) the cable specifications were found different from the ones included in the
contract. After clarifications and a 4-month delay, the materials were shipped; (c) a further 4-month delay
of the fiber optic component was caused by the time needed to obtain a no-objection certificate from the
Punjab Highway Department; (d) after conversion of T&T into PTC, some equipment was retained three
months in the Karachi port due, again, to the imposition of import taxes on PTC for which budget
provisions had not been made. Most of the work on the system was completed in February 1993.



4
11.   Procurement. To avoid some of the delays incurred by earlier projects, the Bank insisted on the
Borrower using standardized procurement documents for equipment, civil works and consultant services.
However, three years after its effective date, T&T had committed only about 50% of the loan. The
contract for the LD fiber optic link between Rawalpindi and Karachi was awarded almost three years late
and the last payment to the consultants for T&T restructuring was subject to delays due to discussions
about the applicability of a 20% withholding tax.
12.   Priect Costs. 'he project cost estimated at appraisal was US$817.2 million, with a foreign cost
of US$462.2 million (57%). Actual expenditures on the project were not maintained separately in
T&TlPTC's overall accounts, and PTC has not been able to allocate the exact local costs to each of the
project. Further, due to implementation delays, the project was implemented in parallel with the Seventh
Five Year Plan (FY89-93), which made a separation of the local project costs more difficult. Tables EmI-
SA and  1-5B show estimated costs of the project as completed. The foreign costs are essentially the
same as the appraised costs, and local costs are about 4% higher.
13.   Disbursements. The disbursement performance of loan 2743-PAK is shown in Table E-3A and
the graph below. Due to delays in implementation of the project, only a 54% had been disbursed by the
original closing date (December 31, 1990). More loan funds were used for equipment and less for civil
works than originally projected. The loan allocations and the amounts disbursed under each category
are shown in Table Ill-3B. After three extensions of the closing date, the loan was closed on December
31, 1993, and April 30, 1994 was established as the final date for receipt of withdrawal applications.
An outstanding balance of US$1,917,203.39 was caiiceled.

Proiert Results
14.          Project Objectives The main project objectives were achieved. T&T was converted into
PTC by the 1991 PTC Act, providing it with more financial and operational autonomy to develop the
telecommunications sector in an efficient manner. The project assisted PTC to improve its staff training,
operational efficiency and planning capability. In addition to training in the operation and maintenance of
the various project equipments, PTC received assistance for the establishment of a Digital Switching R&D
Center, Software and Documentation Centers, and a Training Center financed by KfW. The Bank's loan
provided technical assistance for the setting-up of a Fundamental Planning Unit and studies on T&T
restructuring. With a substantial increase in its installed network capacity, PTC managed to maintain its staff
numbers and achieve a staff productivity of 32 employees per 1,000 telephone lines as of June 1993 (This
implies a doubling in labor productivity between 1986 and 1993). PTC has also significantly improved its
quality of service and operating efficiency, although there still is scope for further progress.
15.           By June 1990, 75% of the target of 400,000 new lines under the Bank project had been
realized. However, other projects, not foreseen at the time of appraisal, added capacity to the network so that
the total additional line capacity in June 1993 had exceeded appraisal estimates by 3.5 times (see Table III-
6A). The telephone density target (0.9 lines /100 population) envisaged by GOP for FY88 was achieved in
1991, and at project completion in 1993 it was 1 .7. Access of the rural areas to the national network was
increased through the installation of 3.190 additional public call offices (PCOs). The domestic long distance
network was substantially improved with the addition of a 565-Mbit/s fiber optic cable between Rawalpindi
and Karachi spanning a total length of 2.036 kmn, financed under the Bank's loan and an additional radio
frequency channel in the microwave network, financed by ADB. For international communications, a new
INTELSAT A-type station was installed under the ADB-financed component. Due to the worldwide
proliferation of facsimile communications, telex service did not grow as originally expected. Between 1986
and 1993, the additional installed telex line capacity was 5,810 (against appraised 11,800 lines). On the
whole, this was a very successful project despite initial implementation delays.
16.          Financial Performance. T&T/PTC's rapid expansion in 1986-1993 is reflected in its
financial perfornance (Part 111, Annex 3). The net plant in service increased from PRs 10.0 billion to PRs
54.6 billion, operating revenues from PRs 4.7 billion to PRs 24.5 billion, and operating income from PRs 2.7
billion to PRs 10.7 billion. Up to 1991, T&T maintained a rate of return of over 15% on revalued net fixed
assets in operation, which comfortably exceeded the covenanted 10%. At its creation in 1991, PTC booked
a revaluation adjustment for fixed assets of PRs 38.0 billion, which has remained unchanged since then. As
equipment prices have been stable in recent years, PTC's book values should reflect plant replacement values
reasonably well. PTC's rate of return of 21 % for 1993 is well above covenanted levels.
17.          T&T/PTC's internal cash generation has been satisfactory and it has been able to fund over
30% of its expansion program out of internal sources. This is remarkable, especially after PTC's
incorporation in 1991 when GOP started to collect a PRs 7.6 billion return on PTC's income along with
various taxes on telephone calls and imports. In 1993, PTC's long-term debt constituted only about 13% of
total capitalization, which indicates a very solid financial structure.
18.          The difficulties and arbitrariness of separating incremental costs and revenues for the
project from the rest of T&T/PTC's investment program was noted at project appraisal. The project rate of
return calculations at appraisal were, therefore, based on T&T's entire FY84-90 investment program. For the
same reasons, the recalculated project rate of return is based on T&TIPTC's entire FY87-92 investment



6
program, taking into account project start-up delays. Incremental revenues are based on 1991 tariff
levels, operating costs (excluding depreciation) on additional assets and traffic generated, and all cash
streams have been deflated up to 1994 by the whole sale price index for Pakistan as published by IMF;
as from 1994, all cash streams have been assumed to remain constant in real terms. On this basis, the
financial rate of return of the project is 21%, which is slightly above the 19% appraisal estimate.
19.   The economic rate of return was calculated on the same basis as the financial one, except that
taxes and duties on imported equipment were excluded from investment expenditures and the 35% tax
on domestic call charges included with other incremental benefits (as a minimum estimate of the consumer
surplus based on subscribers' demonstrated willingness to pay). On this basis, the economic rate of
return is 28%, which compares favorably with the appraised 22%.
20.   The above rates of return most likely underestimate the real returns for the project, because:
(a)    capital costs, especially for FY91 and 92, may include part of PTC's BLT investment but
none of the BLT revenues;
(b)   the fiber optic system provided under the project has substantial spare capacity, which
will permit the profitable long-distance traffic to increase into the next decade. Only
actual traffic increases up to 1994 have been included; and
(c)   tariffs are likely to be increased in real terms from their low 1991 levels.
21.   Impact of Proiect. Very positive results have been achieved in the institutional area with the
conversion of T&T into PTC. GOP also encouraged private sector involvement by granting licenses for
cellular, paging, cardphone, and data operators. Some progress was made on PTC's organization,
although its working methods and procedures still need improvement.
Project Sustainabilitv
22.   The sustainability of the operations and benefits of the project are expected to be very
satisfactory. The project was an essential part of T&T/PTC's program providing a high-capacity fiber
optic link as the backbone of the national long distance network and a very substantial portion of the new
local networks. The benefits will increase as the traffic builds up and the capacity of these systems is
being more fully utilized. PTC will remain the main operator for the foreseeable future as well, most
likely under private management. Its human resources and profitability should ensure continued
expansion and profitable operation.
Bank Performance
23.   During project implementation, the Bank maintained a dialogue with GOP on the restructuring
of the sector. The Bank assisted in resolving the procurement issues between the suppliers and PTC for
the fiber optic cable component between the suppliers and PTC. The Bank also offered assistance to
finance the consultancy needed for preparation of PTC's privatization, but GOP decided to use other
funds. Nevertheless, the Bank reviewed the consultant's reports and participated in meetings of the
Privatization Commission dealing with PTC's privatization. Due to the Bank's reorganization and
transfer of Pakistan from EMENA to South Asia, as well as lack of continuity in staff supervision, the
project implementation suffered to some extent, which is reflected in the quality of the information



7
available on its progress. On the whole, however, the Bank's performance was satisfactory.
Borrower Performance
24.   Except for the delays in the execution of the fiber optic cable project and some procurement
problems, the Borrower's performance was satisfactory. Even with the major change of T&T from a
Government Department to a corporation, PTC was able to maintain continuity and commitments to the
project's objectives and execution. PTC in its drive for accelerated expansion was not able, however,
to give prompt and sufficient resources for improving the quality of service. It is encouraging to note
that in the current FY95 PTC has given priority to the rehabilitation and improvement of the quality of
service. GOP has also requested Bank support for the setting up of a regulatory framework, the creation
of the Pakistan Telecommunications Authority (PTA) and the Frequency Allocation Board (FAB), and
providing for the privatization of PTC, which are major milestones in sector development.
Project Relationshius
25.   The project relationship between the Bank and GOP, the Borrower and the implementing agency,
T&T/PTC, has been very good. The cooperation extended to Bank missions and the response to project
and sector related concerns expressed by the Bank in correspondence and meetings have been very
satisfactory.
C=onsultin Services
26.   Consultancy services and studies were carried out as intended (Table III-6D) and were the basis
for important decisions by GOP, e.g. to corporatize PTC and developments in the areas of digital
switching technology and rural communications.
Project Documentation and Data
27.   The Loan Agreement 2743-PAK was quite adequate for the monitoring of the project objectives,
investments, and organizational and financial areas. The appraisal report for the project provided a useful
framework both for the Bank and T&T/PTC, to monitor project implementation. Except for local project
costs, PTC was able to provide satisfactory reports on implementation of the project.

PART I: PROJECT REVIEW FROM THE BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
(Prepared by PTC in March 1994)
The World Bank provided a loan of 100 Million
U.S.dollars to PTC against Fifth Telecom Project, code-named'Pak-
2743'.The loan was, in fact, in continuation of the previous four
loans,which had helped Pak T&T Department and now Pak Telecom to
expand its network to meet the telecom demand in Pakistan as well
as to raise the quality of service to international standards as
recommended by ITU. The development of a telecommunication
project cannot be considered inisolation. The completion of a new
project expands the existing network, which inturn generates more
telecom traffic. It is to be taken into account otherwise entire
network in a country may collapse denying telephone service to a
subscriber connected to such a network. World Bank has duly.
considered these aspects while appraising the project for
financing.  The  attention  has  always  been  focused  on  the
completion of the project,  the quality of the work executed and
the qualititive  improvement  in the existing network is to be
interfaced. The World Bank missions have been visiting Pakistan
regularly during the period of the execution of Fifth Telecom
Project and witnessing the progress of the project through site
visits. The progress is also monitored through receipt of
quarterly reports prepared and submitted by Pak Telecom to the
Bank in Washington.  The major components of the Fifth Telecom
Project are as follow:-
(a)       Provision of local network facilities over
the period July,1986 to June,1990 for an additional
exchange capacity of 402,000 lines;
(b)        installation of nation wide dialling(NWD)
facilities for an additional 94 towns and cities and
the expansion of the transmission capability of the
long distance network by 9,000 channels
(c)       continued modernization and improvement of
telegraph  and  telex  services,   increasing  telex
exchange capacity by 11,800 lines and the extension
of telex and telegraph facilities to smaller towns
(d)               provision   of   new   international
telecommunication channels via satellite, submarine
cables and improvement in maritime communication
facilities;



11
(e)      replacement of worn out cables and exchange
equipment (75,000 lines), open wire carrier systems
and trunk positions;
(f)     improvement of PTC's organizational structure
and management systems to enhance PTC's operational
efficiency, 'abour productivity, the quality of its
services and its medium and long term planning
capability;
(g)     installation of optical fibre systems between
the major cities of Pakistan;
(h)         studies  and economic  analysis  of PTC's
operations and investment programme and review of its
tariff structure;
(i)        the provision of consultancy services of
support  training,  studies  and  management  system
improvement.
The most challanging part of the project waa the
laying  of  optical  fibre --cable  from  Karachi  to  Islamabad;
challenging because it was a nev technology and the distance to
be covered was quite long. Pak Telecom followed the World Bank
procedures and guidelines in the selction of the successful
bidder, the World Bank staff duly overseeing the whole process of
tendering. The optical fibre system is now operative through
extending the telecommunication services through this modern
technology to almost all the major cities of Pakistan i.e.
Karachi,   Hyderabad,   Sukkur,   Multan,   Faisalabad,   Lahore,
Gujranvala, Sargodha, Ravalpindi and Islamabad. The international
competitive  bidding  carried   out  in  accordance  with  the
procurement guidelines of the World Bank has. helped in keeping
the prices low thus making the project very cost effective
without compromising the quality. The quality of the cable as
well as line equipment was tested in accordance with the
guidelines of the International Telecommunication Union(ITU). The
ITU experts were consulted and the test results were shown to
them who were satisfied with the performance and quality of the
optical fibre cable laid and the -line equipment installed.
Although the project was not completed on schedule yet the end
result compensated for the time lost. Because the expenditure was



12
less than stipulated in the estimates, the quality of the
completed system was according to international standards and
above  all  the  spare  capacity  became    available  for  future
utilization. Presently Pakistan Telecommunication is using 10
fibres only. Two more fibres are being equipped to meet the
requirement of telephone traffic generated by unprecedented
increase in the telephone density in Pakistan during the last
three years. Six fibres will be still available for future use.
The Bank has been focusing attention on corresponding
increase  in  Pak  Telecom  network.  The  Bank,  therefore,- is
motivated to finance the required balance expansion of the
telecom network.
The details are aa. follow:-

PTC/GOP                96.90 (M)             90.762
TOTAL:                462.20 (M)            448.376
The Bank played a constructive
role to assist the T&T Department in institution building by
convincing the Government of Pakistan to give it greater fiscal
and administrative autonomy by converting it into an autonomous
body. The Government of Pakistan accepted the suggestion and
converted the T&T into a corporation with effect from 14-12-1990
naming it Pakistan Telecommunication Corporation and giving it
full autonomy in fiscal and administrative matters.



13
Supervision missions were fairly regular and the
dialogue between the Bank, the Borrower (the Government of
Pakistan) and the Pak Telecom Corporation was smooth, in all
matters including procurement.
Completion of Fifth Telecom Project has not only
helped Pakistan Telecom to meet the rising demand for new
telephone connections but has also helped in mobilising the
economic activity in the country. The performance indicator
placed in the annextures are milestones in witnessing quality
improvement in Pak Telecom Network. The credit for this goes to
the Bank who guided Pak Telecom in the right direction.
The project was very successful in many ways. The
experience gained in coordination with a number of agencies that
were involved in co-financing, this project. It has been very
useful  in the processing and implementation of the follow up
project, which is also supported by substantial co-financing.
PTC has coped successfully with the increasing
complexities of financing of the foreign exchange part of
telecommunication projects. However, the coordination with the
different multilateral and bilateral agencies and suppliers
becomes every year more complex and difficult. The lessons
learned during the Fifth Project, reinforced during the ongoing
projects have led to the realization that the complex financing
transactions and the related procurement activities require added
sophistication in the handling of the foreign financiers and
suppliers. In fact, it is the lead role of the Bank that assisted
PTC to raise its telephone density alongwith improved quality of
system and that of manpower. The PTC. has requested the Bank to
continue the lead role in the future also.

Underivinf Assumptions:
Same assumptions as for the financial rate of return calculations (Table I11-6C), plus:
(i) the 45 % duties and taxes on imported equipment have been excluded from capital expenditures,
and
(ii) the 35 % tax charged on domestic call revenues has been included in incremental benefits, as a
minimum estimate of consumer surplus.
Comments:
The main difference between appraised and actual ERRs is due to the 35 % excise duty on domestic
calls, which was not contemplated at project appraisal.

FY84-90), 1991 tariff levels and additional assets and traffic generated under this investment program.
All cost streams have been deflated by the whole sale price index as published by IMF. As from 1994,
all cash streams have been assumed to remain constant in real terms.

to be made by PTC's commercial auditors.
2On average net fixed assets in operation, including revaluation sdjusiments.
3 Operating expenses as a percentage  of operating revenues.
4' The adverse development of the ratio in FY93 is due to the large *BLTinvestments put into operation
that year, thus increasing the rate base and depreciation of fixed assets and a decline in operating                                             a
income. Once the connection of new subscribers catches up with investments, die ratio will improve
