MIORANDUN  AND A       REOONIIGNTXON OF THE PRSXIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DI mm EtO W N    ASSOCIATION
TO THE EZECUTIVm  DIXRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE IXSLAMIC REPUBLIC OF PAKXIBTAN
FOR A SIXND  PRIMARY EDUCATION DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM
1.    The following memorandum and recommendations on a proposed development
credit to Pakistan of SDR (Special Drawing Rights) 85.2 million (US$ 112.5
million equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposee credit would be
on standard IDA terms with 35 years maturity and help finance the Sindh
Primary Education Development Program. The Program would be cofinanced by the
Kingdom of Norway (NORAD -- US$6.6 million equivalent), and the United Kingdom
Overseas Development Administration (ODA -- US$2.2 equivalent).
Background
2.    Despite increased government support to primary education during the
last decade, Pakistan's adult literacy rate (about 24%) and primary enrollment
rate (about 50%) remain amongst the lowest in the world. Rural - urban, and
male - female imbalances are stark. Literacy rates range from 5% for rural
females, to 55% for -uiban males. With a population growth of over 3% p.a.,
primary education needs to expand rapidly if participation rates are to
increase. The low educational level of much of the population will impede the
country's future economic development. In particular, efforts to improve
maternal and child health and reduce fertility will be severely hampered
without increased attention to female education.
3.    In the province of Sindh, only about 50% of the age cohort is in primary
school, and at current rates of enrollment and population growth, universal
primary education would not be achieved for boys and girls for at least 10 and
50 years respectively. Rural female enrollment is particularly low, with only
9% of the age cohort completing the five year primary education cycle, and
less than 1% still in school at age 14. The small number of rural girls in
secondary education constrains the growth of rural female primary education,
because of the low numbers of potential female primary school teachers.
However, the problems are not confined to rural girls. About 50% of all
children who enter first grade in Sindh drop out during the first three years
of schooling - before literacy is attained.
4.    Between academic years (AY) 1986-87 and 1995-96, an estimated 794,000
additional children (41% of total 1986-87 primary enrollments in the province)
will have to be accommodated just to keep pace with the rapidly expanding
school age population. The particularly fast urban population increase
without commensurate investments has resulted in gross overcrowding in often
dilapidated, and unsafe buildings. Class sizes of over 100 ara not uncommon,
and student learning in these conditions is almost impossible. In addition,
whole urban slum settlements have virtually no primary schools.

Rationale for IDA Involvement
5.    Government policy, supported by IDA with three credits since 1979, is to
give high priority to primary education. IDA's past involvement has assisted
the government to address major policy, institutional and fiscal constraints
to primary education development. The proposed operation would provide part
of the substantial support which would be needed in the next decade, and would
deepen the dialogue on primary education by supporting policies, investments
and expenditures to improve participation, learning and efficiency, and thus
achieve significant quantitative and qualitative improvements.
6.    A number of lessons learned from earlier operations have been taken into
account in the proposed operation, including: a) the desirability of single
province operations to streamline project implementation; b) establishinb
clear management systems and lines of communication; c) the extended time
required to introduce and establish innovations; d) the need for testing and
evaluation of new software; e) adopting construction methods and standards
familiar to the local authorities and contractors; and f) establishing
flexible financing and implementation mechanisms.
The Primary Education Develonment Profram - Obiectives'and Descrintion
7.    The objectives of the Primary Education Development Program (PEDP) in
Sindh are to: a) increase participation in schooling in rural and urban slum
areas; b) enhance delivery of primary education; and c) increase student
learning and achievement. ParticiRation would be increased by: a) improving
access, facilities and maintenance. Classrooms would be constructed in rural
and disadvantaged urban areas. Sanitation, water supply and boundary walls
would be provided for girls and mixed schools. Budgets would be increased to
improve school maintenance and construction implementation capacity would be
strengthened; and b) providing incentives to improve enrollment and retention
of children in school. The primary school year would be changed to start
after the hot season. A pilot school nutrition program would be introduced as
an incentive for parents to enrol children in school. Scholarships would be
provided to rural girls who complete grade 5, to continue through secondary
education. Starting in three districts, promorion between grades 1-3 would be
automatic barring exceptional cases, and school uniforms would be abolished in
rural areas. Delivery would be improved by: a) introducing measures to
enhance the recruitment, motivation and retention of teachers. These include
localizing primary teacher recruitment; relaxing the age limits for female
entry/reentry into primary teaching; lowering the entrance qualifications for
female teachers where shortages persist; giving preference to qualified
primary teachers for promotion; and expanding recognition and reward for
outstanding primary school teachers; b) improving the supply, training and
supervision of teachers. The output of new teachers would be increased, and
qualified primary teachers would be allowed to compete for teacher training
positions. In-service training programs and supervision of primary teachers
would be enhanced; and c) improving planning, management and implementation of
primary education by strengthening and reorganizing the management of primary



- 3-
education at the secretariat, divisional and district levels.  Student
achievement would be enhanced by improving the quality, durability,
distribution and availability of teaching and learning materials, textbooks
and supplementary reading materials, including the provision of free textbooks
to rural girls. The program would provide funds for civil works, educational
materials, vehicles, technical assistance (including training) and recurrent
costs.  The total cost of the nrogram is estimated at US$196.4 million
equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$39.0 million (20%). A
breakdown of costs and financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and
methods of procurement and disbursements are shown in Schedule B. A timetable
of key program processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in
Pakistan are given in Schedules C and D respectively. A map is also attached.
The Staff Appraisal Report (No. 8178-PAK), dated January 31, 1990 is being
distributed separately.
Agreed Actions
8.    The government has already agreed to introduce policy measures to
improve recruitment, deployment, promotion opportunities and motivation of
rural female teachers, designed to make primary teaching a more attractive
career. During negotiations, the following actions were agreed: a) as
conditions of Credit effectiveness: (i) Government approval of the PC-1 and
(ii) the signing of technical assistance agreements; c) as actions to be taken
during implementation: (i) adhere to agreed priorities and criteria for school
construction; (ii) maintain the role of the Directorate of Engineering Works,
and by June 30, 1991, carry out an expansion of the Directorate's staff; (iii)
in time for the academic year (AY) 1990-91, change the school calendar to
August 1-May 30; (iv) for two years, starting in AY 1990-91, in schools in
three districts: (a) experiment with flexible school hours to suit local
conditions; (b) abolish school uniform requirements in rural areas; (c)
abolish the end of year examinaticn for grades 1 and 2, provide automatic
promotion between grades 1 and 3 other than in exceptional cases, and
introduce achievement testing to monitor individual and cohort student
achievement; and (d) by June 30, 1992, evaluate the impact of these measures
on enrolment, attendance and retention of students, and introduce the measures
in all districts of Sindh by the beginning of AY 1992-93, if and to the extent
such an introduction is warranted on the basis of the evaluation and an
exchange of views with IDA; (v) by the start of AY 1992, assign all teacher
training places to new entrants to the teaching profession; and by December
31, 1991, allow those from the primary education stream with appropriate
qualifications and experience to compete for all teacher training positions;
(vi) constitute a steering group for in-service teacher training, and from
September 30, 1991, provide annual reports on the in-service craining program
for primary teachers; (vii) by December 31, 1990, complete the reorganization
of education administration in Sindh; (viii) pilot test all new primary
education textbook manuscripts prior to publication! (ix) provide the
necessary share of the PEDP investment program; and (x) conduct joint annual
reviews with IDA to assess progress, and to determine the following year's
components of the PEDP and the necessary budget for implementation.

9.    The PEDP would: a) increase primary school enrollments particularly for
rural girls; b) improve learning by enhancing the quality of instruction, and
the availability and standard of educational materials; c) improve efficiency
through measures to reduce repetition and drop-out; and d) improve delivery of
primary education through better management and administration. Aggregate
enrollments are expected to increase by 242 between AY 1990-91 and 1995-96.
Rural female enrollment would more than double, enabling the participation
rate to rise from 14X to 23X. By supporting a least cost investment approach
and efficient planning, the PEDP would maximize the benefits to be gained from
primary education expenditures at a time of severe resource constraints.
Risk.
10.   The major risk is that cutbacks in government expenditures on primary
education would jeopardize the achievement of the PEDP targets. The
consequences of rapid population growth are such that the PEDP represents the
minimum investment needed to allow for growth in the rural participation rate,
essential improvements in efficiency, and enhanced quallty of instruction to
ensure that children leave primary education literate and numerate. The
government is firmly committed to these objectives, and provided assurances at
negotiations that it would meet the necessary investment targets of the
proposed Program. A subsidiary risk is that the government may be unable to
carry out the physical and institutional objectives of a Program of the
proposed scale. However, the Sindh Government's physical implementation
capacity has improved during the implementation of previous IDA assisted
projects, and would be further strengthened in the proposed program. To
minimize institutional constraints, the organization and management of primary
education would be improved. In addition, the PEDP would in the main
consolidate and extend programs which had been positively tested in prevlous
operations, using and strengthening existing line agencies.
Recommendations
11.   I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors
approve the proposed credit.
