MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE WATER AND POWER DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY (WAPDA). PAKISTAN
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF PAKISTAN
FOR A TRANSMISSION EXTENSION AND REINFORCEMENT PROJECT
1.          The following memorandum and recommendation on a propose-3 Loan to
the Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA), a semi-autonomous agency in
Pakistan,  for US$162 million equivalent  is submitted for approval.   Ihe
Government of Pakistan (GOP) would be the guarantor of the proposed Loan. The
Loan would be at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, and repayable over
a period of twenty years including a five-year grace period. It would assist
in extending and reinforcing WAPDA's transmission system at least cost.
Background
2.          Pakistan's economic performance during the Fifth and Sixth Plans
(FY79-FY88) was impressive. Growth in GDP averaged about 6.5% annually, and was
spread across virtually all sectors of the economy. The overall improvement in
economic performance was fostered by prudent economic management and structural
reforms, including the deregulation of controls over investment, import
liberalization and the adoption of a flexible exchange rate policy;
rationalization of prices, particularly of agricultural and petroleum products;
and directing public development expenditures toward priority sectors.
3.          Despite these achievements, macroeconomic imbalances were a concern
by FY88.   In the 1980s, public sector expenditures increased faster than
revenues, resulting in a high fiscal deficit, which reached 8.7% of GDP in FY88
compared to 5% in FY80. Inflation began to increase in FY88, reaching about 10%
in FY89. While the merchandise export volume continued to grow, a deterioration
in the terms of trade and generally accommodative domestic credit contributed
to an overall increase in the trade deficit. These developments together with
the continuing erosion in remittances from Pakistanis abroad brought the current
account deficit to about US$1.7 billion or 4.1% of GDP in FY88. More critically,
the Central Bank's gross foreign reserves in September 1988 were equivalent to
less than two and a half weeks of annual imports of goods and services, and less
than the external short-term liabilities of the banking system. These imbalances
together with the low rates of savings and investment, which averaged between
12.5% and 15.9% in relation to historical GDP growth, are unlikely to support
future economic growth of the order of 5.5% and above annually on a sustained
basis, especially in view of the continued neglect of the physical infrastructure
and, until recently, low levels of investment in social sectors.
4.          In FY89, GOP adopted a medium-term macroeconomic adjustment program
to address these imbalances. The program was set forth in a Policy Framework
Paper (PFP), which was reconfirmed by the new Government headed by Prime Minister
Benazir Bhutto. The Bank's Executive Directors considered the PFP on December
19, 1988, and the Fund's Board approved a 15-month Standby Arrangement and a
Structural Adjustment Facility (FY89-91), supported by the PFP, on December 28,
1988. The key policy requirements of PFP are: (a) a reduction of the fiscal



2 -
deficit, through an enlarged sales tax and other measures to broaden the tax base
and the substantial containment of the growth of expenditures; (b) additional
trade policy reforms with significant liberalization of non-tariff barriers; and
(c) finincial sector reforms with a view to improving the efficiency of the
banking system and to strengthening management of domestic public debt, money
and credit according  to market principles.   Review of the first year's
performance indicates that GOP is in general compliance with the program.
Pro1ect Lttin.
5.          One of the objectives of the medium-term macroeconomic framework is
the reduction of fiscal deficit and inflationary pressures.   This is to be
achieved through the curtailment of expenditures by the public sector; the
mobilization of resources through improved taxation; better pricing and phasing
out of subsidies; and the enhancement of the role of PS in the development of
key sectors such as energy, industry, including financial intermediation, and
transportation. In order to support GOP's effort in implementing this framework,
a package of policies to support the structural adjustment of the sector, and
a CIP for the Seventh Plan were agreed with the Government. The CIP is comprised
of investments, private and public, critical to achieving the objectives of the
Seventh Plan, while ensuring that outlays for energy remain within the overall
investment and credit ceilings set under the medium-term framework. The CIP for
the power subsector for 7Y89-93, calls for the development of 7,058 MW of which
4,789 KW would be implemented by WAPDA and KESC, and the remaining 2,269 MW by
PS. The financing for WAPDA's and KESC's power generation development program
is identified, and the financing for the distribution is either secured or is
about to be completed through financing by USAID, Japan and the Bank for the
rural electrification; and United Kingdom, the Asian Development Bank and Japan
for urban distribution. However, the financing for the transmission is still
incomplete.
6.          During the Fifth Plan and Sixth Plan, WAPDA experienced shortages
of financial resources which forced it to concentrate its resources on generation
and, to much lesser extent, distribution. As a result, transmission developed
on an ad hoc basis, dictated by the need to evacuate power. ESL I and WAPDA IV
and V have rectified some of this imbalance; however, additional investments
at the 500-kV level are still required, if the network is to develop in step with
the generation development program agreed under CIP. In fact, the inadeqacy of
this network is increasingly becoming a constraint on WAPDA's ability to
efficiently dispatch power to meet the demand for electricity at least cost.
7.          In anticipation of the increased role PS is expected to play in the
development of energy, GOP created the Private Sector Energy Development Fund
(PSEDF) under financing from the Bank, cofinanced by bilateral agencies (Loan
2982-PAK). The Fund would cover 30% of the total cost of PS investments for the
development of energy, through loans at the prevailing market interest rates and
repayment over 23 years, including 8 years grace. The remaining 70% of the
financing is to be secured through equity (25%) and commercial loans (45%)
extended without sovereign guarantee. So far, GOP has received several proposals
which would provide 2,100 MW of the projected 2,300 MW called for under CIP for
1989-1993. The Hab Power Complex (HPC), the first and largest proposal to be
financed, constructed and operated by PS, would provide 1,292 MW of oil-based
thermal power generation. The power plant would be located in Baluchistan, 30
miles north west of Karachi. The feasibility study for the complex has been



- 3 -
completed.   Negotiations of the security package,  comprised of a set of
interrelated agreements, designed to safeguard the interests of the lenders,
Government and investors, is expected to be initialled before December 31, 1989.
Financial closure is expected by March 1990 and the commencement of the
implementation of the complex shortly thereafter.
8.          Under the security package, the investors assume completion and
operational risks while GOP guarantees the performance of its agencies in terms
of the purchase of power by WAPDA and the supply of fuel oil by either PSO or
PARCO.  Failure by investors to complete the power station as agreed, or to
supply the power contracted, would reduce the returns of the investors and, in
extreme cases, diminish their equity. On the other hand, failure by WAPDA to
purchase power in the agreed quantities would require GOP to pay for the power
contracted for with HPC.   The evacuation of power from HPC would require
interconnection between the complex and the national grid at the 500-kV level.
Moreover, in view of the requirement that PS investments be financed under
limited recourse, the security of lenders, in terms of repayment, hinges on the
revenues to be generated by the project. Unless concrete steps are taken by
WAPDA to implement the transmission link, necessary for HPC generation of
revenue, the international financial community would be reluctant to move to
financial closure. This would delay the implementation of CIP for FY89-93 and
in turn undermine GOP initiative in mobilizing PS investments for the development
of energy.
Project Oblectives
9.          The proposed Project would:  (a) contribute to the implementation
of CIP for FY89-93 for transmission through:  (i) the extension and reinforcement
of the 500-kV network to ensure adequate and effective evacuation of power from
the main thermal power generation centers at Guddu and Multan to the major load
centers in the middle and northern region of the country; and (ii) extension of
the transmission link between the HPC (1,300 MW), the first major power project
to be financed, constructed and operated by PS, and the national 500-kV network;
and (b) continue institution building efforts initiated under the Bank's earlier
lending operations by strengthening WAPDA's capabilities in implementing,
operating and maintaining an efficient and economic transmission system.
Project DescriDtion
10.         The proposed Project would comprise:
(a)   the installation of two single circuit 500-kV transmission lines,
about 200 km each, connecting the HPC and Jamshoro;
(b)   the installation of a third single-circuit 500-kV line, about 312
km between Guddu and Multan, and a second single-circuit 500-kV line
of about 300 km, between Multan and Lahore via Gatti;
(c)   the extension and reinforcement of existing 500-kV substations at
Lahore, Gatti, Multan and Guddu with associated facilities including
reactive compensation, telecommunication and control equipment; and
(d)   consulting services to assist and train WAPDA's staff in the design,
construction, operation and maintenance of the 500-kV network.

Rationalek fz Bank XInlvement
11.         The proposed Project is an Integral part of the ESL II program, which
provides the umbrella of priority investments and policy reforms to be
implemented during the period FY89-93.   ESL 1I is aimed at assisting GOP in
implementing LES and contributing to the achievement of a crucial objective of
the medium-torm macroeconomic framework agreed to with the Fund and the Bank,
that of reducing the fiscal deficit to sustain the economy's growth momentum and
control inflation. The Bank's support for this project Is to be viewed in the
context of its continuing role in both promoting private sector involvement in
energy development and rationalizing investments in the public sector.
12.         As ESL II provides the umbrella for the Bank's lending for specific
energy investments, including the proposed Project, all policy issues relating
to the energy sector in general and the power subector in particular are being
addressed under that Loan. Therefore, under the proposed Loan, agreements have
been reached on project specific issues only. Specifically the following have
been agreed as conditions of effectiveness of the proposed Loan: (a) approval
of the PC-1 by ECNEC for all components of the proposed Project; (b) appointment
of internationally experienced consultants to assist and advise WAPDA in the
design and implementation of lines in coastal areas of high moisture with salt
and dust content; and (c) issuance of bidding documents for at least 25X of the
total requirement for towers and earthing materials. The submission by WAPDA
of preliminary commitments by lenders for financing the Hab Power Complex (HPC)
is set as a condition of disbursement for the UPC component of the proposed
Project.
Benefits
13.         The proposed Project would assist GOP in extending and reinforcing
WAPDA's transmission system at least cost to promote the effective evacuation
of power from the power plants to be comissioned during the Seventh Plan period
by both the public and private sectors. Benefits under the proposed Project are
expected from the incremental sales of electricity and from the improvements in
the overall operating efficiency of power plants and reduction in losses in the
networks. The internal economic rate of return for the proposed Project is about
11 based on incremental sales of electricity which were valued on the basis of
the projected increases in tariffs required to achieve the 40X self-financing
ratio agreed to under ESL II.
Risks
14.         The proposed Project consists of normal electric utility work
entailing no unusual risks, and no particular difficulty is foreseen in its
execution.   Project cost estimates and implementation schedule are based on
similar work currently in progress in the country and on coiltracts let out during
the Second and Third Quarter of 1989, so there should be little risk of
substantial cost overrun or of extended slippage. There is, however, the risk
that HPC would slip by at most six months because of delays in financial closure.
The potential for this delay is being minimized by arranging interim financing
while the negotiations of the commercial loans are under way to cover the initial



-5 -
payments for the equipment requiring long lead time to manufacture and commence
civil works, and hence implementation of HPC would be maintained in line with
the forecast timetable.
Recommendation
15.         1 am satisfied that the proposed Loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank, and recommend that the Executive Directors approve
it.
