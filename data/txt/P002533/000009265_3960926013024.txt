MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF SAO TOME AND PRINCIPE
FOR A COCOA REHABILITATION PROJECT
1.        The following report on a proposed development credit to the
Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe for SDR 6.1 million
(US$7.9 million equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit
would be on standard IDA terms and would assist in financing a project to
rehabilitate two cocoa plantations and reinforce support activities for the
medium- and long-term development of the agriculture sector. The proceeds
of the credit would be channelled to the Bela Vista and Uba Budo State
Enterprises as equity. The Government would bear the foreign exchange
risk.
2.        Background.  Agriculture is the mainstay of STP's economy and
provides the livelihood of about 70% of the population, generating
approximately 30% of GDP and 90% of the country's exports. Out of
38,000 ha used to grow tree crops; cocoa covers 24,000 ha. Other cash
crops include coffee, palm oil and coconuts, and some food crops. Food
production consists of bananas, breadfruit, palm oil, root crops, and more
recently, vegetables. Foodstuff imports accounted for more than one third
of imports of goods in 1985. STP's ecology is favorabla for agriculture
whose history reflects the successive monocultivation of export crops.
Today, STP has an established infrastructure, principally for cocoa
production which was first introduced in 1870. Production peaked in 1913
at 36,500 tons, representing 12% of world production, but declined steadily
to about 10,000 tons by independence in 1975 and finally to 4,000 tons in
1986. The main reasons behind the recent decline are the lack of
management expertise, financial resources, appropriate incentives to
workers, and the macroeconomic distortions in the economy.
3.        To remedy this situation, the Government's strategy is to
(a) implement a structural adjustment program which includes a major
devaluation to improve the profitability of cocoa production;
(b) accelerate revival of the cocoa industry by reinforcing technical
support services to the cocoa subsector and rehabilitation of existing
plantations; (c) promote private sector involvement by creating adequate
conditions for foreign private participation in the state enterprises
(EEAs) and promote smallholder participation in agricultural production;
(d) diversify the agriculture sector over the medium-term to avoid the
risks of a single-crop economy; and (e) progressively define and carry out
social reforms which would improve the standard of living of the rural
population. The proposed project would assist the Government in
implementing this strategy, with emphasis on the cocoa subsector.

4.        Project Objectives.  The main objective of the project would be
to assist the Government in its efforts to achieve economic recovery
through increased cocoa production as well as assisting Government with
longer term objectives for the development of the agriculture sector as a
whole. The project would support foreign management to be contracted by
the Government to rehabilitate two cocoa plantations and would promote
adequate incentives to the workers, as well as improve support services to
the agriculture sector.
5.        Project Description.  The project would be carried out over a
five-year period and would support: (a) the replanting and rehabilitation
of about 3,500 ha in two plantations (Bela Vista and Uba Budo), each under
the management of a foreign firm whose contracts have been negotiated and
signed; the repair of processing equipment and irrigation works; and the
purchase of equipment and agricultural inputs and machinery; (b)
improvement of worker housing and social infrastructure and development of
food crop plots for workers; and (c) activities to facilitate future
financing of other cocoa plantations. The project would also establish:
(1) a Cocoa Applied Research and Development Unit to promote the planting of
high-yielding hybrids, to optimize the use of fertilizer, to control pest
and diseases, and to produce selected seeds; (2) a Food Crop Development
Unit to identify the most suitable food crops for domestic production; and
(3) an Agricultural Training Unit to train administrative personnel and
foremen employed on the two plantations. In addition, the project would
provide technical support to smallholders, carry out studies and help
prepare and implement strategies and action plans on subjects such as
agricultural diversification, land tenure, cocoa marketing, agricultural
credit, forestry and the ecology.
6.        Total project cost is estimated at US$21.8 million, with a
foreign exchange component of US$19.0 million (87%). IDA would contribute
US$7.9 million equivalent (SDR 6.1 million). Other cofinanciers are BADEA
(US$6.0 million equivalent), IFAD (US$1.9 million equivalent), CCCE (US$1.0
million equivalent), OPEC (US$1.1 million equivalent), USAID and Portugal
(US$0.9 million equivalent), WFP (US$0.6 million equivalent), and FAC and
AFVP (US$0.3 million equivalent). The Government would finance US$2.1
million equivalent. The breakdown of costs and the financing plan are
shown in Schedule A. Procurement arrangements and a disbursement schedule
are given in Schedule B.  A timetable of key project processing events and
the status of Bank Group operations in Sao Tome and Principe are given in
Schedules C and D, respectively. A map showing project location is also
attached.  The Staff Appraisal Report (No. 6146-STP dated May 29, 1987) is
being distributed separately.
7.        Rationale for IDA Involvement.  Substantial improvement of the
country's economic situation is linked to the rehabilitation of the cocoa
subsector. The proposed project would be the first major step in
implementing the Government's strategy to give its agricultural enterprises
true autonomy in their decision making process and in their access to, and
use of, resources. The Bank Group, including IFC, has a comparative
advantage in attracting external financing and private firms to assist the



-3-
Government in this undertaking. The project would be implemented in
parallel with the First Structural Adjustment Credit, facilitating the
supply responses and ensuring the viability of the country's external
accounts over the medium term.
8.        Main Agreements Reached.  At negotiations, the Government's
agreement was obtdined on the following: (a) by March 31, 1988,
implementation of measures to provide the EEAs with effective management
autonomy; (b) by March 31, 1988, elaboration of a flexible salary system
for field workers and team leaders; (c) by March 31, 1988, authorization
for the EEAs to recruit and discharge staff; (d) timely payment of workers'
salaries; (e) by December 31, 1987, regularization of workers' housing
situation; (f) composition and terms of reference for the Project Support
Unit, project coordixiator and deputy coordinator; (g) by September 30,
198(', a plan to carry out institutional reforms in applied research,
training, and agricultural services; (h) by December 31, 1988, review of
the system of import and sales of inputs and equipment to smallholders;
(i) by December 31, 1989, an interim review of project implementation,
including the extension of the foreign firms' role in managing other EEAs;
(j) monitoring of cocoa sales tax rates; and (k) reduction of environmental
risks. The effectiveness of one of the two management contracts, the
settlement of debt, and the establishment of an accounting system
acceptable to IDA of the EEA concerned are conditions of effectiveness of
the proposed credit. The same conditions for the other management contract
are conditions of disbursement on that management contract. Other
conditions of effectiveness are the establishment of the Project Support
Unit and the employment of its project coordinator, and of its deputy
coordinator.
9.        Justification.  The immediate benefit of the project would be an
increase in foreign exchange revenues from cocoa sales. Through the
experience of the project, the stage would be set for the rehabilitation of
other cocoa plantations, including future privatization possibilities.
About 1,500 workers would directly benefit from improved housing
conditions, better nutrition through the cultivation of food plots,
increased access to consumer goods and prompt payment of salaries and
bonuses. Smallholders would also benefit from access to inputs, tools and
machinery. The agriculture sector as a whole would benefit from the
strengthening of the technical support services. The economic rate of
return on the project's investments over 25 years is estimated at 21% and
is based on the production-related costs and benefits for the plantations
receiving IDA assistance. Sensitivity of the ERR has been tested to
shortfalls in revenues due to reduced yields or lower world market prices,
and increases in investment and production costs. The results indicate
that even with a 20% decrease in benefits, the ERR would be 14%; with a 20%
increase in costs, the ERR would be 15%.

10.       Risks.  The project faces no significant technical, marketing or
organizational risks. The use of new planting technology would be
carefully monitored by the foreign management firms. Furthermore, soil
analyses carried out by a reputable cocoa research institute under the PPF
have shown that the proposed technology is suitable to STP's ecological
conditions. Possible delays in government reforms to promote an economic
environment favorable to cocoa production are minimized by the recently
approved macroeconomic measures in the framework of the structural
adjustment program. Along with other measures to be taken under the
project, the devaluation is expected to ensure the viability of the cocoa
sector.
11.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
