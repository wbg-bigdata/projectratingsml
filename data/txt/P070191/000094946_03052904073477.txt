- Environmental Assessment for Adjusted
Shanghai Sewerage Project Phase III
1   Background
Shanghai Sewerage Project Phase III (SSPIII) is one of components included in Shanghai
Urban Environment Project (SHUEP) to seek an Adaptable Programme Loans (APLs) facility
from the World Bank. The Environmental Assessment (EA) of SSPIII was reviewed by
Shanghai Environmental Protection Bureau (SEPB) in February 2002.
In October 2002, Shanghai was awarded to host the Expo for 2010. To prepare the 2010's
Expo, an ambitious redevelopment programme for riversides along the Huangpu has been
launched. As the previous proposal of Minxing wastewater treatment plant for Area B of
SSPIII seems contrary against the redevelopment programme, Shanghai Planning and
Development Commission and Shanghai Construction Commission organised Shanghai
Water Authority (SWA) and other concerned agencies to further study and adjust the scheme.
A supplementary feasibility study report was submitted and reviewed following the planning
formality.
According to the remark given by SEPB to the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for
SSPIII, should there be any changes in components, characters, scale or siting of the project,
the ELS ought to be resubmitted for review and approval. Therefore, a supplementary report
to the EIS for SSPIII has been prepared to reflect the adjustment and for submission'.
The changes of adjusted SSPIII are mainly in the scheme for Area B (Table 1).

2   Adjusted Scheme for Area B of SSPIII
The previous scheme for Area B of the SSPIII covered 31.56 lkm(2  Now it is expanded to
37.09 km2 by including four self-draining areas in Hongkou and Yangpu districts and
Minxing catchment. The design dry weather flow is increased from 405,200 m3/d to 431,000
m13/d whilst the capacity of sewage treatment plant will still be kept at 500,000 m3/d.
The site of sewage treatment plant is moved from Minxing Road in the previous scheme to
Zhuyuan, and the alignment of main sewer is changed accordingly (Fig. 1).
2.1 Main Engineering Work for Area B
The main engineering work for Area B of SSPIII includes sewage collection system and
treatment facilities.
1) Sewage collection system:
Link sewers in sub-service areas, main storm-water drainage system, main sewer, and a
midway pump station. The total length of the sewers is 14.15 km
2) Construction of a sewage treatment plant at southeast side of Zhuyuan No.1 WWTP at
Chang Jiang estuary:
* Wastewater treatment - sewage treatment plant;
* Wastewater discharge - head tower, outlet pumping station and outfall.
2.2 Wastewater Treatment Plant
2.2.1 Design capacity
The design capacity of Zhuyuan No.2 Sewage Treatment Plant (for telling from Zhuyuan
No.1 WWTP of SSPD) is 0.5 million m3/d with average dry weather flow of 5.79 m3/s, dry
weather peak flow of 7.52 m3/s, and minimum flow of 3.47 m3/s. Most of the service area of
the treatment plant is combined sewerage service area with an interception ratio of 1.5 or 3.0
(interception ratio n is defined as the total capacity of collection system being (n+1) times dry
weather flow). Thus, the storm peak flow is 21.26 m3/s.
2.2.2 Design Strength of Influent and Effluent
Based on a survey, the strength of influent sewage is proposed. The effluent strength should
be in compliance with Grade 2 of integrated wastewater discharge standard (GB 8978-1996)
(Table 2).
Table 2 Design strength of influent and effluent in sewage treatment plant of SSPIII
Item              CODc,     BOD5      S       NH3-N    Total P
Influent strength (mg/L)       300      150      200       25       4.0
Grade 2 of discharge standard (mg/L)  120  30     30       25       1.0
2.2.3 Sewage Treatment Process
The sewage treatment plant at Zhuyuan will use an A/O process. It comprises two biological
steps namely anaerobic and oxydic processes respectively to remove phosphorus and BOD in
the sewage (Fig. 2).

Ulaving been pretreated by grid screening and sedimentation, the influent is introduced into an
anaerobic tanlk. in which phosphorus in the sewage will be released in a form of ortho-
phosphates into the mixed liquor Through a retention interval, the sewage flows into an
oxydic tank, in which ortho-phosphates in the mixed liquor will be drastically absorbed by the
sludge in an aerobic condition. Thus, the content of phosphorus in the liquid phase of sewage
will be significantly decreased. After a secondary sedimentation, the effluent with lower
phosphorus can be discharged whilst higher content of phosphorus remaining in the separated
residual sludge.
In the application of A/O biological phosphorus removal process, a ratio of BOD5 to total
phosphorus in the sewage is a key factor to affect the phosphorus removal efficiency. If the
ratio is too low, phosphorus-absorbing microorganisms in the sludge will be unable to
sufficiently take up phosphorus, and the content of phosphorus in the effluent will not be
dropped to a possibly lower level. It is reported that to achieve the phosphorus content lower
than I mg/L, the ratio of BOD5 to total phosphorus in the influent should be higher than 20, or
a ratio of dissolved BODs to dissolved phosphorus greater than 12. Based on the design
strength of the influent of SSPIII, the ratio of BOD5 to total phosphorus can meet the
requirement for biological phosphorus removal, and the phosphorus content in the effluent is
expected to be in compliance with the limit set in the Grade 2 of integrated wastewater
discharge standard (GB 8978-1996).  The anaerobic step in the process, however, is
unfavourable to nitrogen removal. Like the conventional biological treatment process, the
nitrogen removal is only about 20%. If the total nitrogen content in the influent is not so high,
the effluent can be in compliance. As the operation and management of the A/O biological
phosphorus removal process are rather simpler, and there is mature experience for the
operational management available in China, this process is therefore suitable.
2.2.4 Discharge Outfall and Handling of Sludge
An outfall is to be set at bankside of the Chang Jiang estuary at Zhuyuan for normal discharge
of the effluent, but a deep-water outfall will be set for emergency discharge.
The sludge generated in the sewage treatment process is handled with mechanical thickening
and dewatering. 582 m3/d sludge cake with water content of 65% will be hauled by trucks to
a sludge treatment works at Bailong Gang.
2.3 Rationale of WWTP Siting at Zhuyuan
An analysis of the wastewater treatment plant alternatives in SSPIII, i.e., Minxing option and
Zhuyuan option, has been conducted during the previous EA in terms of social and
environmental impacts. It was found that the both water bodies at Zhuyuan of Chang Jiang
estuary and in the lower reaches of the Huangpu River would unlikely cause significant
impacts if the effluent had been subject to appropriate treatment. The assimilative capacity of
Chang Jiang estuary,' however, is comparably much higher than that of the Huangpu River,
and moreover, the Zhuyuan option could eventually get rid of almost all the pollution
loadings collected by this system away from the Huangpu River, whilst the Minxing option
still allow the return of part of the loadings back to the Huangpu River by release of the
effluent. From a water quality point of view, especially no effect on the Upper Huangpu
water resources, the both options could be acceptable if relevant measures were taken for
minimising unanticipated impacts.

Then it was called for further consideration particularly in terms of economic, planning and
risk prevention aspects.  Some incompatibility did exist between the WWTP siting of
Minxing option and regional planning. For the Comprehensive Redevelopment Programme
of Riversides along the Huangpu is an ambitious plan launched by the SMG, all the
development projects should be in line with this core task, and the SSPIII scheme could be no
exceptions. Hence, the Minxing option seemed to be not consistent with this ambitious plan.
Since the successful awarding of hosting the 2010's Expo, the redevelopment of riversides
along the Huangpu River has become one of focal tasks in Shanghai before the year 2010.
More conflicts with the redevelopment plan have emerged in respect to siting the WWTP at
Minxing Road. Thus, the adoption of the Zhuyuan option becomes more rational in respect to
not only being in favour of the improvement on water quality of the Huangpu River, but also
the consistency with the regional planning in particular.

3   Potential Environmental Impacts of Adjusted Scheme for Area B
3.1  Impact of Effluent Discharge on Water Body of Chang Jiang Estuary
The potential environrmental impacts of the adjusted scheme for Area B of SSPIII on water
body of Chang Jiang estuary have been analysed in the previous EA report. It is summarised
as follows.
Based on modelling simulations, in general, it was found that the body of water in the
Zhuyuan area has a great capability of dilution. The discharge of wastewater after primary
enhanced treatment/secondary treatment into the area will not generate any notable effect on
the water quality in the surrounding body of water at Zhuyuan. Even under emergency
conditions (without treatment for a short period of time, e.g. a couple of days), the effect of
the wastewater discharge will be quite limited in a very small area. It was believed that with a
better design of the diffuser system, the effect could be limited further.
When the effluent enters Chang Jiang estuary at Zhuyuan, it will be mixed with river water,
and some particulates in the effluent will be collided with those in river water, and then a
series of bio-geo-physicochemical reaction process such as adsorption, exchange and complex
will occur. It is a kind of purifying process. Lingqiao emergency water intake is a key object
there (about 8 km upstream from Zhuyuan proposed outfall). According to the estimation by
modelling, in very dry season when annual Chang Jiang River discharge flow is 7,500 m3/s
(occurrence is over 95%), the CODCr increment at Lingqiao will be some 0.24 mg/L, BODs
about 0.055 mg/L, NH3-N 0.046 mg/L, and total P 0.00185 mg/L. It will have little impact on
Lingqiao water intake even by the effluent of primary enhanced treatment in SSPI combined
with the effluent of the SSPIII.
3.2 Impact on Ambient Air
Sludge disposal procedure at Zhuyuan WWTP will need 960 m distance for hygiene
protection, and therefore three surrounding farmer village will come under impact. If
treatment measures are adopted and pollutant removal rate can reach 90% or above, then the
hygiene protection distance will reduce to 250 m, and those three surrounding villages will
not be impacted by sludge disposal procedure.
3.3 Impact of Noise
Zhuyuan No. 1 WWTP is located on the northwest of the proposed Zhuyuan No. 2 WWTP,
the west of which is Haixu Road, the east is Yantang Road, and there are some residents on
the south. According to the modelling, on daytime, the noise contribution of its inflow pump
house to the south and north factory boundary, air blower room, sludge dewatering machines
and surrounding factory border all will exceed Class 2 limit value 50 dB(A) in «Noise
standard at boundary of industrial enterprises (GB 12348-90)»>, with the highest exceeding 9
dB(A). It reveals that some mechanical noise in the Zhuyuan WWTP will not meet the
requirements at the factory boundary. As the site of the Zhuyuan WWTP is a widely open
field at the bank of Chang Jiang, the village dwellers are rather farther away so that little
impact of noise will be exerted on them.
3.4 Impact on Social Environment
In light of the need for construction of a siphon tunnel across the Huangpu River, a midway
pump station and more main sewer to convey the collected sewage to the Zhuyuan WWTP, it

According to (<Land Administration Law of PRCD and relevant regulations of land acquisition
and resettlement for municipal construction projects in Shanghai, the project proponent
SWEC will allocate special budget and cooperate with district and township governments to
appropriately dispose the inhabitants to be resettled.
Along with the economic development of rural area and expansion of urbanised area in
Shanghai, a lot of farmning labours have turned to industrial sectors. Most farmers would not
very much mind losing land and having a city life. The rural resettlers will be generally
provided with housing in neighbouring newly-built farmer town, or according to relevant laws
and regulations with homestead and fund for building new houses by their own, or just with
cash. In the urban area, the resettlement will be carried on generally by providing new
commodity housing, or giving monetary redress.
The enterprises to be resettled will be relocated according to district and township plans.
They will obtain compensations for the loss of fixed assets and partly non-fixed assets by the
project proponent.
Through the resettlement, the dispersed farmers' households will be assembled gradually so
as to make the land use more rational and improve the living standard of farmers.
Some of enterprises will incur economic losses by the relocation. They will face production
halts, rebuilding and transforming. The workers in those enterprises will lose job in this
period, and their earning will decrease. It may raise some social problems of growing number
of such personnel who are waiting for job.

3.5  Impacts of Sludge Transport
The sludge produced in the sewage treatment process is black to brown in colour, and
contains about 35% to 55% of carbon, 4% to 6% of hydrogen, 20% to 30% of oxygen, 1.5%
to 6% of nitrogen, 0 5% to 4.5 % of sulphur, and a little quantity of heavy metals. The
contents of its leachate show that it is not a kind of hazardous wastes. It reveals that the
landfill is an appropriate way for disposal of the sewage treatment sludge.
The means of transporting the sludge cake will be watertight trucks, and the travel distance
from Zhuyuan to Bailong Gang sludge landfill is about 16 km. It will take about an hour for a
round trip without passing through the urban area.
The potential impact of conveying 582 m3/d sludge cake with 65% water content (about 204
t/d in dry weight) could be spill on the way, washing of trucks, and traffic noise and vehicle
exhaust. If the trucks are sealed up and have anti-leakage device, the spill of sludge can be
minimised to the least. Washing facility will be used to clean up the residual sludge attached
on the wheels and out side surface of truck bodies before leaving the loading or unloading
site. The wash water should be drained to sewerage system other than released to storm-water
drain system or casually discharged into surface water directly.
3.6  Potential Impact of Construction Activities
Major environmental impacts in the construction phase include road excavation, traffic
disruption, effects on land and water system quality as well as impacts of dust, excavated
spoil and noise on surrounding areas.  Actually, this is the stage with most serious
environmental impacts. Along with the conclusion of the construction, most of those impacts
would vanish, and local social, natural and ecological environment would get recovered.
3.6.1 Impact on Surface Waters
The area that construction will take place is quite flat and characterised with a network of
rivers and creeks. The proposed sewer will pass across a number of waterways. Therefore,
following impacts may be unavoidable from project construction on surface water in the area:
*   During the construction period, the land surface vegetation coverage rate would be
decreased drastically (even down to zero, i.e., all exposed) and dumps of soils and
spoils would be increased, thus resulting in an increased content of pollutants in run-
off and, in turn, directly impact the quality of water environment.
*   As the groundwater table in the construction area is comparatively high, it is
necessary to pump out impounded water. If directly discharged into the rivers or into
municipal storm-water drain system, it will increase solids in receiving water bodies
to accelerate the silt-up of riverbed; or may cause pipe blocking to result in flooding
in the drainage service area.
3.6.2 Impact on Road Traffic
The construction will involve some pieces of roads, which are often quite busy. During the
construction, the work will either traverse roads, or go along roads. Thus, the traffic will be
influenced a lot. Some of roads have to be temporarily closed, and others may be not closed
but dumped with different kind of debris or materials along the roads to make them narrower.
Traffic congestion among motorised vehicles, bikes and pedestrians may cause the roads in a
great mess or even accidents.

Haulage of spoil is another potential impact on the road traffic. Considerable amount of spoil
could be generated in the project components. If a truck is overloaded, spill of the spoil may
occur along the way, and moreover, cloud of dust flying up in dry weather or muddy surface
in wet weather could influence the travel of pedestrians and vehicles as well as the
environmental quality
3.6.3 Impact on Inland Water Traffic
As river courses have to be closed during construction period, boats are required to change
their routes. The time to be lasting for a river course to reopen to traffic depends on river
width, construction scale and complexity. It usually takes four months within which water
transport will be greatly affected.
The blocking of some navigable channels may influence certain enterprises that use those
waterways for transport of their materials. Some economic losses may be incurred to them. It
could only be restored when the construction finished.
3.6.4 Impact of Fly Dust
During the construction, building demolition work is the first and direct source of the fly dust.
Excavated spoil usually temporarily heaped up at the construction sites is another major
source, and its duration may last several weeks or even several months. Wind blowing or
vehicle travelling nearby could raise a cloud of dry dust over the sky resulting in sharp
increase in fine particulate content in the ambient air and serious impairment of the city's look
and surrounding landscape. When it rains or snows, construction sites would become muddy
due to flushing by rainfall or smelt snow water plus pressing by vehicles. It would make
inconvenience to pedestrians. Relatively, duration of the demolition work will be shorter, but
the excavation work may last longer.
3.6.5 Impact of Noise
Main sources of noise could be falling down of the building being demolished, operation of
construction machines and traffic homing of vehicles transporting demolished materials or
building materials. If the construction activities are carried on at night, the disturbance could
be very serious to prevent the nearby inhabitants from working or sleeping, in particular,
some part of work are to be carried on in densely populous area.
3.6.6 Impact of Debris and Domestic Refuse
Some of usable materials from building demolishing may be reused, but the rest may be
unusable such as broken bricks/tiles and debris. If they are disposed of improperly, the
tidiness of the area and future use of the land could be irmpaired. Especially, if they are
thrown into rivers or ditches, it could result in the waterways blocked up.
At the construction sites, there could be about thousands of workers and staff members
accommodated with lodging and catering on-site. Therefore, it is very important to have
proper facilities available for water and power supply as well as waste collection in those
temporary construction camps. Otherwise, seriously adverse effect on sanitary environrnent
of the construction sites may be caused to result in poor health condition of the working
people there. Much worse it might cause epidemic diseases greatly influencing construction
progress.  Meanwhile, the inhabitants in surrounding areas would also suffer from
mosquitoes, flies, offensive odour and diseases.

4   Environmental Management
4.1  Mitigation of Environmental Impacts
4.1.1  Construction Stage
The project proponent will put environmental requirement for the construction activities
explicitly in the contract to be signed with the contractors so that the latter can follow the
prescribed measures to control the pollution that may raised during the construction period by
their own will and the proponent may strengthen its supervision according to the contract.
To alleviate environmental problems and troubles to the surrounding residents that may occur
during construction stage, management will be strengthened with regard to noise from
construction activities, traffic jamming due to materials/spoil transport, flying dust raised
from the ground due to material handling and earthwork and other wastes from construction
camps:
*   Regularly spray the construction sites, transport routes and materials handling sites
with water in dry and windy days, especially in congested downtown area, or near
sensitive receptors, such as villages and residential areas;
*   Carefully schedule construction activities to minimise the impact of noise from
construction machinery to the surrounding environment, and prohibit uses of certain
noisy machines such as pile drivers, concrete vibrators, etc. at night-time;
•   Prepare road and river traffic plans in conjunction with relevant authority ahead of
construction in the congested urban centres, particularly in areas where roads or
waterways must be closed or semi-closed for pipe and sewer laying, and on river side
or in water construction;
Collect and divert sewage and other waste from construction camps to municipal
systems to avoid contamination of the surrounding areas;
*   Compensate appropriately and promptly the relocated and resettled residents,
farmers, commercial operations, schools, institutions and other organisations
according to relevant laws, regulations, guidelines and rates of the government or the
World Bank;
*   Well plan temporary land occupation, particularly in the farmland, ahead of the
construction in consultation with the farners and others affected to minimise the loss
of crops, and restore the land to its original state at the end of the temporary uses;
and
* Properly dispose of debris from demolishing buildings and spoil from earthwork at
construction sites in designated ways only, and strictly prohibit disposal of such
wastes in farmland, ponds or rivers.
4.1.2 Operational Stage
In the operational phase, appropriate mitigation measures will be taken for minimising the
avoidable environmental impact and keeping the system performance in anticipated status so
as to enhance the environmental effectiveness of all project components:
*   Properly follow the operation procedures and ensure the Zhuyuan WWTP and sludge
disposal facilities operation as designed;

A Supplement to Environmental Assessment for Shanglli Urban Environment Project
Develop contingency plans for power failure, overflows, equipment malfunctioning
and other conditions which may affect the proper functioning of the plant resulting in
discharge of untreated wastewater into the receiving environment;
*    Develop a management plan for pesticide and fertiliser application in the green area
to protect the safety of the public and workers; and
* Maintain regular consultation with the residents in the nearby communities and
respond promptly any concerns they may raise with regard to the operations of the
wastewater treatment, pumping station and sludge handling and disposal facilities.
4.2 Prescribed Mitigation Measures
In order to minimise the potential environmental impacts in the course of construction and
after commissioning.of SSPIII as possible, the mitigation measures that may put to use have
