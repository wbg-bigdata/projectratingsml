Program Purpose 
and 
Project Development Objective 
1. 
Program 
purpose 
and 
program 
phasing: 
The 
Shanghai 
Municipal 
Government 
(SMG) 
has 
adopted 
an 
ambitious 
and 
forward-looking Five-Year 
Development 
Plan 
(2001-2005) 
in 
which 
it 
seeks 
to 
enhance  the 
economic, 
financial, 
trade  and 
manufacturing 
stature 
of 
Shanghai, 
with 
the 
objective 
of 
Shanghai 
becoming 
a 
sustainable, 
global 
and 
competitive 
Municipality 
and 
an 
international 
economic,  trade 
and 
shipping 
center 
at 
the 
heart 
of 
the 
Yangtze 
River Delta 
economic 
region. 
China’s entry 
into 
the 
World 
Trade 
Organization 
(WTO) 
provides 
an added 
stimulus, 
reinforcing 
Shanghai’s 
development 
strategy 
of 
market-oriented reforms. 
As 
part 
of 
this 
overall 
development 
strategy, 
the 
Shanghai 
authorities 
have 
explicitly 
recognized 
the 
need 
not 
only 
to 
halt 
environmental 
deterioration, 
but 
also 
to improve 
urban environmental conditions 
to 
foster 
sustainable 
growth 
and 
improve 
living 
conditions 
for 
its 
citizens. 
The 
Urban 
Environmental 
Management 
Plan 
defines 
SMG’s 
strategy: 
physical 
and service-level 
targets are 
contained 
in 
the 
Tenth Five-Year 
Plan. 
Nearly 
all 
key 
policy 
decisions 
have already been 
taken 
to 
underpin implementation 
of 
the 
Urban 
Environment 
Management 
Plan, 
including: applying 
the 
principle 
that the 
polluter 
pays; 
redefining 
the 
role 
of 
state 
from 
that 
of 
a service 
provider 
of 
urban environmental 
services 
toward 
that 
of 
regulator 
with 
an 
increasing 
role 
for 
private 
sector 
initiatives; increasing 
financial 
self-reliance 
of 
urban environmental 
services 
for 
operations 
and capital 
investment;  and 
limiting 
the 
amount 
of 
capital 
investment 
in 
urban 
environmental 
services 
to 
be financed 
from 
the 
municipal 
government 
in 
the 
form 
of 
contributed equity. 
The 
longer-term social 
and 
environment protection 
goals 
include: 
redressing 
the 
imbalance 
in 
access 
to 
urban environmental 
services 
in 
the 
poorer and 
less 
well-served 
areas 
across 
the 
Municipality. 
using 
surface 
and 
groundwater 
resources, 
which 
should be balanced 
with 
their 
sustainable 
supply 
across 
the Shanghai 
Municipality; 
collecting, treating and disposing 
of 
all 
wastewater 
and 
runoff 
and sludge 
generated 
from 
municipal 
wastewater 
treatment 
in 
ways 
that 
protect 
public 
health 
and  atmospheric, 
terrestrial 
and 
aquatic 
environments 
and 
conserve 
diminishing 
land 
resources; 
collecting, 
transferring, 
treating 
and 
disposing 
of 
solid 
waste 
from 
households 
and 
the 
growing 
volume 
from 
food 
services 
in 
ways 
that protect 
public 
health and 
atmospheric, 
terrestrial 
and 
aquatic 
environments; 
optimizing 
the 
environmental  benefits 
in 
terms 
of 
air 
quality 
from 
the 
expected 
increase 
in 
availability 
of 
natural 
gas; 
and 
finding 
alternative/improved 
approaches 
for 
upgrading urban environmental 
services 
in 
currently 
underserved 
areas 
to: 
(a) 
support 
Shanghai’s 
cultural 
heritage 
protection 
objectives;  and 
(b) 
maintain 
community 
life 
without 
resorting to 
massive 
clearing/permanent 
relocation. 
There 
are 
currently 
no 
regular capital- 
or 
revenue-sharing 
arrangements 
between 
the 
nine 
districts 
(and 
one 
county)  and Shanghai 
City for 
the 
formers’  environmental 
infrastructure 
needs. These 
districts 
are 
growing rapidly 
and 
their 
environmental 
degradation 
is 
now 
a 
major problem requiring 
solutions  they 
cannot 
afford 
to 
finance 
entirely 
from 
their 
own 
resources. 
Under 
its 
Tenth Five-Year 
Plan, 
SMG 
is 
pursuing 
a 
program 
to 
promote 
the 
development 
of 
one 
satellite 
city 
(Songiiang) 
and 
nine 
central 
towns. 
There 
are 
currently 
11 
satellite 
cities, 
22  central  towns 
and 
over 
40 
other  towns 
in 
Shanghai 
-3- 
Page  8
Municipality. 
SMG 
proposes 
to 
formulate integrated 
institutional 
and 
financing 
arrangements 
that 
would 
better 
serve the 
needs 
of 
its 
suburban 
districts, 
including 
meeting part 
of 
the 
district 
urban environmental 
infrastructure 
requirements and 
services 
through 
a 
district financing 
vehicle. 
A 
successful 
model could 
be 
replicated 
in 
the 
rest 
of 
China. 
In 
order 
to 
meet 
its 
environmental 
objectives, 
SMG 
and 
the 
districtdcounty 
face 
large-scale  and 
continuing 
investment  commitments. 
Some estimates 
indicate 
that 
to 
meet the 
Tenth Five-Year Plan 
targets, 
they 
would 
need 
to 
finance a 
minimum 
of 
Y40 
billion 
($4.85 
billion 
equivalent) 
in 
the water and 
wastewater subsectors alone. 
SMG 
has 
therefore established a core 
program 
of 
activities 
and investments 
that 
it 
considers 
to 
be 
the 
top priority, 
and requested 
World 
Bank 
support 
over 
the 
next 
eight 
years 
through 
an 
Adaptable 
Program 
Loan 
(APL). 
The 
major 
organizing 
concept 
for including 
activities 
in 
the 
core 
program 
is 
that 
they 
are 
based 
on 
a 
metropolitan-wide 
vision 
of 
the  needs 
and 
require 
metropolitan-wide 
measures 
to 
be 
achieved. 
This 
core 
program 
is 
described 
in 
SMG’s 
letter 
of 
development 
policy 
and 
amounts 
in 
investment 
terms 
to 
a 
program 
of 
about 
$2.6 
billion 
equivalent. 
Shanghai’s strategy 
is 
deserving 
of 
Bank 
assistance. 
No 
other 
large 
city 
in 
China 
(or 
in 
the 
developing 
world) 
has 
adopted a 
strategy 
that 
so 
explicitly 
links 
environmental 
progress 
with 
long-term 
economic 
growth. 
Furthermore, 
no 
other 
city 
in 
China 
is 
as 
likely 
to 
be 
able 
to 
successfully 
spearhead 
new 
approaches 
to 
public-private 
partnerships 
in 
environmental 
services, 
and 
new 
approaches 
to 
tapping 
capital 
market 
finance, 
which 
are 
needed 
to 
implement 
such 
a 
strategy. Shanghai 
has 
long 
been a 
model 
for 
and 
leader 
of 
reforms 
in 
China 
and 
the 
reforms 
embedded 
in 
its 
very ambitious 
urban 
environmental 
strategy 
are 
likely 
to 
have 
major 
demonstration 
effects 
on 
urban 
areas 
throughout 
the 
country 
and 
the 
region. 
Shanghai 
has 
already 
received 
support 
from 
the 
World 
Bank 
for: 
(a) 
focused 
urban 
wastewater 
investments 
(First 
and Second 
Shanghai Sewerage 
Projects--SSP1 
and 
SSP2); 
and 
(b) 
urban 
water 
supply 
and 
solid 
waste management (Shanghai 
Environment 
Project--SEP). 
The Bank 
has 
had 
good 
experience 
in 
Shanghai. 
Implementation 
performance, 
including 
institutional 
performance, 
has 
steadily 
improved 
in 
successive 
projects 
and  the 
Bank 
has 
found 
in 
the 
city 
authorities 
a  partner 
who 
appreciates 
how 
environmental 
sector issues 
should be 
handled. 
With 
the 
exception 
of 
the 
wastewater 
investments and a 
small 
water 
supply 
subcomponent 
in 
Songjiang 
City 
financed under 
SEP, 
Bank 
financing 
has  been 
limited  to 
investments 
servicing 
the 
core  urban 
area 
of 
Shanghai 
City. 
The 
success 
of 
the 
above-mentioned 
projects 
in 
terms 
of 
institutional,  financial 
and 
physical 
performance improvements 
forms 
a 
solid 
base 
for 
Shanghai 
to 
proceed 
now 
in 
pursuing 
more innovative 
ways 
of 
providing 
services 
to 
its 
citizens, 
and 
to 
extending 
such services 
to 
its 
less 
affluent 
citizens 
living 
outside 
the 
city 
core. 
In 
order 
to 
finance even 
this 
smaller 
core 
program, 
SMG 
would 
either 
have 
to 
partially 
defer 
or 
reduce 
funding 
presently 
allocated 
to 
some 
of 
its 
other 
programs, 
including 
its 
important 
social  welfare 
programs, 
or 
seek 
alternative 
sources 
of 
funding 
more 
closely aligned 
to 
the 
financing 
of 
its 
proposed 
infrastructure 
investments. 
SMG 
has 
chosen 
to 
do 
the latter,  and 
has 
asked 
for 
Bank 
support 
in 
policy, 
institutional 
reform 
and investment finance. 
It 
has 
also 
asked 
Bank 
help 
in 
gaining 
access 
to 
long-term 
sources 
of 
finance  through, 
for 
example, issuance 
of 
infrastructure 
bonds, 
tapping the 
domestic 
capital 
market 
and 
involving 
the 
private 
sector, 
either 
alone 
or 
in 
partnership, 
in 
“build, 
operate 
and transfer” 
(BOT) 
schemes, 
or 
concessions. 
The 
proposed 
Shanghai 
Urban 
Environment 
Project 
(SmP) 
adaptable 
program 
loan (APL) 
would 
aim 
to 
support 
SMG 
to: 
(a) 
implement 
the 
urban environment goal 
of 
its 
development 
strategy 
and 
thereby 
help 
to 
ensure 
that 
economic 
growth 
takes 
place 
in 
an 
environmentally 
and 
institutionally 
sustainable 
manner; 
(b) 
provide 
major 
long-term 
environmental benefits 
to 
its 
millions 
of 
citizens 
and 
to 
the 
ecology 
of 
Shanghai 
Municipality 
(SM);  and 
(c) 
develop 
innovative 
policies, 
institutional 
reforms 
and 
financing

methods 
that 
are 
needed 
to 
support 
the 
environmental 
goals  and 
that 
will 
serve 
as 
models 
for 
local 
government and 
environmental 
reform 
throughout China. 
This 
smaller 
core 
program 
requires 
implementation 
of 
numerous 
and 
complementary 
measures, 
each 
with 
its 
own 
trajectory 
of 
policy 
formulation, 
institutional 
refodcapacity 
building, 
enabling 
steps 
and 
finally 
physical 
investments. 
The 
core 
program 
looks 
at 
first 
glance 
like 
a 
time 
slice, 
capturing 
a 
different 
combination 
and 
configuration 
of 
phases 
for 
each 
component. 
However, 
in 
conceptual 
terms, each phase 
of 
the 
overall 
core 
program 
is 
designed 
to give 
prominence 
to 
one 
aspect 
of 
the urban environmental 
strategy 
being 
pursued, 
which 
contributes 
to 
and 
enables 
the 
pursuit 
of 
the 
next 
phase 
of 
SMG's 
urban 
environment 
management strategy. 
In 
Phase 
1, 
prominence 
is 
given 
to 
further  developing 
the 
underpinnings 
and 
enabling 
conditions 
to 
pursue an 
integratedhegional 
approach 
to 
environmental 
issues. 
Investments 
included 
in 
this 
phase 
are 
those 
that 
are 
already 
known 
to 
be 
priority 
components 
of 
the 
integratedlregional 
approach 
(including 
the 
protection 
of 
upstream 
sources 
for 
water 
supply, 
expansion 
of 
shared 
landfills, 
complementary 
investments 
to 
increase 
efficiency 
of 
earlier 
investments). 
Further 
development 
of 
integratedhegional 
programs 
and related 
investments 
is 
expected 
to 
be 
continued 
during 
subsequent 
phases. Phase 
1 
will 
also test 
new 
approaches 
to 
upgrading urban environment 
services 
in 
a 
poorer, underserved 
area 
through 
a 
pilot 
program. 
Phase 
2 
will 
support 
implementation 
of 
programs  that 
address 
environmental 
issues 
of 
greater 
complexity 
and 
respond 
to 
the 
deepening 
of 
SMG's 
work 
on 
the 
environmental 
agenda 
(including 
solid-waste 
management 
program 
consolidation, 
bond 
finance 
and 
a 
district 
financing 
vehicle, 
and 
continue 
to 
expand 
the 
pilot 
approaches 
to 
upgrading urban environment 
services 
in 
poorer, underserved 
areas). 
Preparations 
for 
these Phase 
2 
activities 
are 
to 
be 
made 
during 
implementation 
of 
Phase 
1. 
Phase 
3 
is 
the 
stage 
at 
which 
the Shanghai 
authorities 
hope 
to 
begin 
realizing 
the 
fruits 
of 
their efforts to 
build 
up 
to 
a sustainable 
financial 
system 
for 
urban environment 
services. 
It 
is 
anticipated 
that 
further 
improvements 
to 
the operations,  management 
and 
finances 
of 
at 
least 
some 
urban 
environment 
service 
utilities 
over 
the course 
of 
Phases 
1 
and 
2 
would 
enable 
them 
to 
move beyond 
the 
municipal 
budget 
to 
finance 
their  capital 
investments 
on 
acceptable  terms, 
either 
on 
the 
capital 
markets  and/or 
obtaining 
finance 
from 
a  sustainable 
district  financing 
vehicle. 
Complementing 
this 
is 
the 
development  and 
establishment 
during 
Phases 
1 
and 
2 
of 
the 
supply 
side, 
including 
enabling capital 
market/financing 
arrangements 
and 
institutions. 
Phase 
3 
also continues the 
deepening 
of 
the 
environmental 
agenda, 
moving 
on 
to begin 
pursuing 
some 
of 
the 
improvements 
in 
air 
quality potentially 
available 
from 
the 
increased 
supply 
of 
natural 
gas 
to 
the Shanghai 
metropolitan 
area. 
2. 
Project 
development 
objective: 
(see 
Annex 
1) 
The 
three loans 
under the 
proposed 
APL 
are 
designed 
with 
the 
objective 
of 
improving 
environmental 
conditions 
by 
progressive development and 
implementation 
of 
integrated, 
metropolitan-wide 
measures. 
The 
main 
development 
objective 
of 
APLl 
is 
to 
put 
in 
place 
some 
of 
the 
underpinnings 
and 
enabling 
conditions 
for 
SMG 
to 
pursue 
this 
integrated, 
metropolitan-wide 
approach. 
Policies/programs 
will 
be 
formulated 
to 
enhance, 
among 
others, management 
of 
water 
resources, 
market-based 
approaches 
for 
solid 
waste services, 
development 
of 
new 
financing 
instruments, and 
the 
testing 
of 
alternative 
approaches 
for 
improving 
urban environment 
services 
in 
underserved 
areas. 
A 
second 
objective 
would 
be 
to install, 
in 
both 
the 
city 
center 
and 
some 
of 
the 
surrounding districts, 
facilities 
already 
known 
to 
be 
high 
priority to 
achieve 
metropolitan-wide  environmental 
objectives 
(e.g., 
protection 
of 
upstream 
sources 
for 
water 
supply, 
expansion 
of 
shared 
landfills, 
and 
complementary  investments 
to 
increase 
efficiency 
of 
existing 
-5- 
Page  10
wastewater 
facilities). 
The 
development 
objective 
of 
APL2 
is 
to 
have 
the 
surrounding districts participate increasingly 
in 
the 
metropolitan-wide 
measures 
to 
improve 
wastewater 
and 
solid 
waste  management, 
and 
to 
deepen 
the 
scope 
of 
the 
environmental 
agenda 
being 
addressed 
across the 
Municipality. 
Investments 
to 
be 
financed 
include 
those associated 
with 
the 
implementation 
in 
the 
districts and 
the 
core 
city 
of 
policies/programs 
developed 
in 
APLl 
(including 
associated 
human 
resource 
development). 
The 
environment 
agenda 
will 
be 
deepened 
to 
include, 
among 
others, 
air 
quality, 
development 
of 
policies/programs 
for 
treatment 
of 
medical 
waste, 
strategy 
for 
dealing 
with 
agricultural 
waste, 
approaches 
for 
rehabilitatiorhpgrading 
of 
urban environment 
services 
in 
old 
urban 
areas 
and 
rehabilitation/redevelopment 
of 
old 
industrial 
areas 
in 
the core 
city. 
The 
development 
objective 
of 
APL3 
is 
to 
have 
a 
technically  and operationally  effective, 
financially 
sustainable 
urban environmental 
services 
system 
across 
the 
Municipality. 
SMG, 
with 
the support 
of 
the 
central 
government, 
has 
proposed 
that the above 
objective be 
achieved 
with 
support 
from 
an 
APL 
over 
about 
eight 
years 
in 
three 
phases 
commencing 
about 
July 
1, 
2003 and 
ending 
about September 
30, 
2011. 
The 
aggregate amount 
of 
loans 
under the 
APL 
is 
expected 
to 
be 
about 
$700 
million, 
with 
tranches 
of 
$200, 
$300 
and 
$200 
million. 
3. 
Key 
performance 
indicators: 
(see 
Annex 
1) 
The 
success 
of 
SMG’s 
urban environment improvement 
program 
will 
be 
evaluated 
by 
the 
rate 
of 
progress 
made 
in 
meeting 
three 
types 
of 
goals--service  coverage, 
environmental 
outcome 
targets, 
and 
tests 
of 
financial 
sustainability 
for 
the 
provision 
of 
urban 
environmental 
services. These 
are 
related 
to, 
but 
not 
synonymous 
with, 
the 
proposed 
triggers 
for 
proceeding 
with 
approval 
of 
subsequent 
APLs, 
which 
are 
discussed separately. 
Performance 
indicators 
for 
each 
APL 
phase 
will 
be 
focused 
more 
on 
outputs and 
outcomes, 
and relate 
to 
the rate 
of 
progress 
on 
putting 
in 
place 
the 
necessary 
preparations and 
enabling 
arrangements 
to 
prepare 
for 
the 
next 
steps 
in 
deepening 
the 
environmental 
agenda 
and 
obtaining 
the 
benefits 
of 
an 
integratedlregional urban environmental 
services  strategy. 
Additional 
water 
quality 
and 
financial 
performance 
targets 
are 
described 
in 
Annex 
1.

Strategic 
Context 
1. 
Sector-related 
Country 
Assistance 
Strategy 
(CAS) 
goal supported 
by 
the 
project: 
(see 
Annex 
1) 
Document number: 
25 
141-CHA 
Date 
of 
latest 
CAS 
discussion: 
12/19/02 
CAS 
Memorandum 
of 
January 
22,2003 and 
Country Program 
Matrix 
(FY03-05) 
As 
China 
makes 
its 
historic 
social and 
economic transitions 
to 
a 
more urban 
society 
and 
a 
market-based 
economy, 
the 
project 
would 
directly 
support 
two 
of 
the  three 
CAS 
themes. 
Firstly, 
to 
facilitate 
an 
environmentally 
sustainable 
development 
process. 
Enhancing 
environmental 
management and 
mitigating 
water, 
and 
air 
pollution 
are 
key 
sectoral 
directions 
of 
the 
Banks 
CAS. The 
project 
supports 
this 
theme 
through: 
(a) 
the 
establishment 
of 
new 
mechanisms 
for 
environmental 
infrastructure 
finance; 
(b) 
the 
extension 
of 
urban 
wastewater 
collection, 
treatment 
and 
disposal 
facilities; 
(c) 
the  expansion 
of 
the 
collection, transportation 
and 
safe 
disposal 
of 
solid 
and 
non-hazardous 
industrial 
waste 
in 
the core 
urban 
area; 
and 
(d) 
the 
development 
of 
water 
resource 
protection 
in 
the 
Upper Huangpu 
Catchment. 
It 
would 
improve 
the 
efficiency 
of 
infrastructure 
services 
by 
strengthening, 
where 
necessary, the 
service 
delivery 
institutions, 
enhancing 
capacity through 
focused 
interventions. 
-6- 
Page  11
The 
second 
directly 
supported 
theme 
is 
to 
help 
improve 
the 
business 
environment, and 
facilitate 
the 
transition 
to 
a 
market 
economy, 
moving 
from 
the 
liberalization 
phase 
to 
the 
more 
challenging 
structural 
and 
institution-building 
phase. 
In 
particular, 
strengthen 
urban 
management 
and support China’s 
planned 
financial 
sector 
reform. 
With 
China’s accession 
to 
the 
WTO 
in 
2001, 
and 
the 
private 
sector 
continuing 
to 
grow 
dynamically, 
support 
for 
innovation 
and 
change 
through more 
programmatic 
and 
pilot 
operations 
with 
strengthened 
links 
to 
private 
sector 
financing, 
would be 
major 
features 
of 
Bank 
operations. 
The 
proposed 
APL 
has 
been 
designed 
by 
Shanghai 
to specifically 
support 
these 
strategic 
directions, 
in 
tangible 
ways, 
through developing new 
financial 
mechanisms 
and 
instruments, strengthening 
metropolitan 
management, 
and 
advancing 
environmental 
service 
delivery 
approaches. 
2. 
Main 
sector 
issues 
and 
Government 
strategy: 
Shanghai 
Municipality 
is 
one 
of 
four  provincial-level 
cities 
in 
China 
and 
is 
the 
country’s 
largest 
contiguous 
urban 
center, 
with 
a permanent, 
registered 
population 
now 
approaching 
14 
million 
and 
an 
additional 
temporary 
population 
of 
about 
3 
million. The 
city 
is 
China’s  most 
important industrial 
base, 
and the 
major 
center 
of 
commerce, 
trade, 
finance 
and 
science. 
Shanghai 
accounts 
for 
about 
1 
percent 
of 
China’s population, 
and 
about 
5 
percent 
of 
its 
gross 
domestic 
product 
(GDP). 
Shanghai 
made  substantial 
progress 
during 
the 
last 
decade 
of 
the 
20th  century 
in 
restructuring 
its 
economy 
and 
in 
upgrading 
its 
environmental infrastructure. 
However, 
in 
spite 
of 
the considerable recent 
investments 
in 
urban 
services, 
some 
3 
million 
of 
the 
urban 
residents 
live 
in 
very 
crowded 
conditions, 
with 
inadequate 
access 
to 
drinlung 
water 
and 
sanitation.  Less  than 
two 
thirds 
of 
wastewater 
and 
stormwater 
in 
Shanghai 
City 
is 
hygienically 
intercepted 
and disposed of,  and 
only 
some 
11 
percent 
of 
sewage 
flows 
are treated 
to 
secondary treatment  standards 
and safely 
disposed;  the 
existing 
sanitary 
landfill for 
municipal solid 
waste 
disposal 
has 
only 
about 
two 
years‘ 
capacity remaining; 
and the water 
quality 
in 
the 
Huangpu River, 
the 
main 
source 
of 
drinking 
water, 
has 
become 
increasingly 
polluted 
over 
the past 
five 
years, 
rendering 
it 
marginally 
acceptable 
as 
a source 
of 
dnnlung 
water. 
Air 
quality 
has 
also 
deteriorated 
during 
this 
period. 
The inequality 
of 
access 
to 
services 
is 
also 
of 
concern 
to 
SMG; 
this 
is 
exacerbated 
by 
an 
emerging disparity 
of 
incomes. 
SMG 
recognizes the need 
to 
urgently 
address these issues, 
in 
line 
with 
responding 
to 
the consequence 
of 
rapid 
economic 
growth 
and 
urbanization 
of 
eastern 
China 
and 
the 
Yangtze 
Delta, 
and 
in 
order 
to 
achieve 
its 
objective 
of 
becoming 
a 
world-class 
international 
economic 
and trade 
center; 
SMG 
has 
specific 
objectives 
aiming 
to 
achieve the highest 
standards 
of 
urban environmental quality. 
Shanghai 
considers 
that 
good 
environmental 
performance 
will 
both 
enhance 
the 
quality 
of 
life 
of 
its 
citizens and 
help 
it 
to 
continue 
to 
attract 
high-quality 
foreign 
investment. 
Shanghai‘s 
development 
strategy 
follows 
that 
with 
increasing 
global 
concern 
for 
the 
environment,  and 
with 
many 
multinational 
corporations 
worried 
about 
reputational 
risks, 
SMG 
would 
be 
able 
to 
turn 
good 
environmental 
performance 
into 
a 
competitive 
advantage 
in 
the 
future: 
the 
government 
intends 
to 
make 
greater  strides 
in 
changing 
the 
role 
of 
government 
from 
a 
provider 
of 
services 
to 
more 
of 
an 
enabler and 
facilitator. 
SMG 
has 
articulated 
five  policy 
themes 
that 
it 
proposes 
to 
address 
during 
implementation 
of 
its 
development 
plan. 
The 
five 
themes 
are: 
e 
developing 
innovative 
mechanisms 
for 
financing 
its 
environmental 
and 
other 
infrastructure 
investments, 
including 
adopting 
publidprivate 
partnership 
strategies; 
gaining 
experience 
in 
effectively 
engaging 
the 
nongovernment 
sector, 
both 
stand-alone 
and 
in 
partnership 
with 
the 
public 
sector; 
e 
augmenting 
existing urban 
infrastructure 
in 
a 
cost-effective 
manner; 
e 
enhancing environmental 
management 
and 
pollution 
control; 
and 
-7- 
Page  12
improving 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
the 
municipal 
management 
and 
service 
delivery 
institutions. 
Articulation 
of 
these 
themes  demonstrates 
the 
ambitious 
and 
far-reaching  nature 
of 
SMG’s 
urban 
environment 
strategy 
and 
program 
objectives, and 
SMG’s 
full 
understanding 
of 
the 
highly 
complex 
and 
interrelated 
nature 
of 
the 
measures 
needed 
to 
bring 
these 
objectives 
to reality. The 
themes 
and 
proposed 
measures 
in 
the 
SMG 
program 
represent 
a 
deepening 
of 
the 
environment 
sector 
development 
agenda, 
as 
they 
progress 
from 
the 
relatively 
straightforward 
issues 
in 
water 
supply  and 
primary 
types 
of 
infrastructure 
for 
wastewater 
collection 
(where  substantial 
progress 
has 
been achieved 
under 
previous 
Bank-supported 
projects) 
into 
more 
difficult 
and 
complex 
areas 
such 
as 
wastewater 
treatment, 
solid-waste 
management, 
and 
improved 
air 
quality. 
This 
sequence 
in 
itself 
reflects 
a  progressive 
evolution 
in 
the 
role 
of 
the 
public 
sector 
in 
environmental 
services, 
complemented 
by 
a 
growing 
prospect 
for 
private 
sector 
involvement. 
And 
as 
the subsectoral features 
develop and 
publidprivate 
roles 
evolve, 
they 
also enable 
a progression 
from 
reliance 
on 
financial 
support 
from 
the 
municipal 
budget, 
toward 
the 
sector’s 
own 
cash 
generation 
and, 
eventually, 
to 
tapping 
the 
financial/capital 
markets 
to 
fund 
capital 
investment 
needs. 
Overarching 
these 
themes 
is 
the 
broadening 
of 
their 
development 
vision 
in 
spatial 
terms 
beyond 
the 
city-center 
to 
also 
include 
the 
surrounding 
nine 
districts 
and  one  county. 
While 
administratively 
separate 
on 
some 
urban  environment 
matters,  the 
city 
center 
and 
the 
surrounding 
districts 
and 
county 
have 
significant 
mutual 
interests 
in 
pursuing 
an 
integrated, 
metropolitan-wide 
urban 
environment 
management approach. 
During 
its 
Tenth Five-Year 
Plan, 
environmental 
protection 
investments 
would 
account 
for 
3 
percent 
of 
the 
municipal 
GDP, 
to 
be 
financed 
by 
enhanced 
user 
charges 
and a range 
of 
new 
and 
refined 
financing 
methods. 
Quantified 
targets 
have been 
set 
for 
water  supply, 
wastewater 
collection 
and 
treatment,  and 
municipal 
solid 
waste 
management. 
The 
environmental 
legal 
system 
would 
also 
be 
strengthened and 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
environmental decision-malung 
processes 
improved. 
The 
City 
is 
responding 
to 
local, 
regional 
and 
global 
issues 
in 
its 
development 
plans, 
and continued 
augmentation 
of 
its 
infrastructure 
is 
critical 
for 
its 
future 
competitiveness. 
SMG 
recognizes 
the 
need 
to 
adopt 
a 
more holistic 
approach 
to 
environmental 
management 
involving not 
simply 
the 
control 
of 
point 
sources 
of 
pollution 
but 
also 
measures 
to 
influence 
other 
urban activities 
that 
generate 
pollution 
of 
a 
dispersed  nature. 
In 
this 
connection  the 
Tenth 
Five-Year 
Plan 
recognizes 
the 
growing 
impact 
of 
motorization 
on 
urban 
environmental 
quality. 
SMG 
also 
plans to 
further 
modernize 
its 
management, 
establishing 
an 
integrated 
legal 
framework 
for 
urban 
management 
with 
a 
rational 
division 
of 
responsibilities 
among 
local 
jurisdictions. 
This 
would 
be 
achieved through: 
(a) 
the 
establishment 
of 
a comprehensive 
urban hierarchy, 
consisting 
of 
major 
urban 
centers, 
satellite 
cities,  suburban 
areas 
and towns/townships; 
(b) 
a comprehensive 
urban 
infrastructure 
system; 
and 
(c) the 
adoption 
of 
an 
environmentally 
sustainable 
approach 
in 
all 
investments. 
3. 
Sector 
issues 
to 
be 
addressed 
by 
the 
project 
and 
strategic 
choices: 
Both 
the 
central 
and 
Shanghai 
municipal 
governments have 
determined that 
a 
project 
prepared 
along 
the 
lines 
of 
an 
APL 
would 
best serve Shanghai’s 
requirements 
for 
a 
programmatic and 
innovative 
approach 
to 
the 
provision 
of 
the 
next 
generation 
of 
urban infrastructure. 
For 
Shanghai, 
a 
programmatic 
loan 
would 
allow 
for 
a 
more 
integrated and 
flexible 
approach 
to 
development 
and 
metropolitan 
management 
than a 
solely project-focused 
strategy 
and 
would 
offer 
more 
scope 
for 
innovation through 
its 
inherent 
greater 
flexibility. 
A 
copy 
of 
SMG’s Program 
Development 
Letter 
is 
included 
as 
an 
attachment 
to 
Annex 
1. 
-8- 
Page  13
The overall 
objective 
of 
the 
APL 
program 
would 
be 
to 
support 
SMGs 
efforts 
to 
improve 
the 
competitive 
advantage 
of 
Shanghai 
in 
the 
region 
and 
the 
world 
through 
improved 
urban environmental 
conditions, 
thus 
improving 
the 
quality 
of 
urban 
life 
within 
the 
municipality 
and the 
sustainability 
of 
its 
infrastructure. 
This 
long-term 
development 
program 
would 
comprise  a 
blend 
of 
policy,  institutional 
and investment 
initiatives. 
The 
program 
would 
support 
a 
stronger 
market 
orientation 
for 
municipal 
services 
pricing, 
and 
institutions 
delivering 
those  services 
would 
be 
strengthened, 
as 
would 
the  Shanghai 
Water 
Authority 
(SWA) 
and the 
Shanghai 
Environmental 
Protection Bureau 
(SEPB) 
in 
their regulatory functions 
of 
water 
resource management 
and 
monitoring 
water 
and 
air 
quality. 
It 
would 
also 
aim 
to 
have 
a broader 
impact 
on 
the 
reforms 
and development 
of 
other 
cities 
in 
China through testing 
of 
new 
concepts and 
innovative 
measures, 
in 
particular innovative financing 
of 
waterhanitation 
and 
solid 
waste services. 
The 
operation 
builds 
on 
the 
main 
tenets 
of 
the  Bank's 
urban 
strategy, 
liveability, 
good governance, 
bankability 
and 
competitiveness, 
and extends 
the 
idea 
of 
sustainable 
development 
into 
the 
setting 
of 
a 
broad 
city 
region. 
In 
this 
respect, 
it 
is 
the 
first, 
and 
possibly 
the 
most 
ambitious, 
effort 
in 
the 
Bank 
to 
address 
the 
central 
issues 
of 
sustainable 
urban development 
on 
a 
large 
metropolitan 
scale. 
By 
focusing 
on 
the 
client 
concerns 
for 
environmental 
improvements, 
the 
project 
addresses 
two 
interloclung 
issues--environmental 
quality 
and 
competitiveness--both 
seen 
as 
central 
to 
quality 
of 
life 
and 
the 
generation 
of 
livelihood 
in 
the 
region. 
Sector 
reforms 
embedded 
in 
the 
project 
also 
have 
the 
effect 
of 
improving 
city 
financial 
practices and 
institutions, 
and demonstrating the 
imperatives 
of 
market 
pricing 
and 
cost 
recovery 
for 
environmental 
services. 
The  project 
agencies  are 
keenly 
aware  that 
the 
Municipality 
must 
achieve a 
coherence 
of 
effort 
in 
its 
regulations, service 
delivery 
and 
financial 
practices 
if 
Shanghai 
is 
to 
stay 
competitive 
in 
global 
markets 
and 
responsive 
to 
its 
citizens. 
Metropolitan 
environment 
management 
has 
always been a 
great 
challenge 
in 
developing 
countries and 
has 
been 
marked 
by 
deteriorating  qualities 
of 
environment 
and 
liveability,  institutional 
clutter  and 
overlap and 
lack 
of 
a coordinated,  comprehensive 
approach. 
This 
APL 
gives the 
opportunity to 
engage 
with 
these 
issues 
in 
a 
metropolis 
that 
is 
willing 
to 
reinvent 
its 
systems 
of 
governance and 
regionalize 
them 
to 
develop 
a 
more 
holistic 
and well-integrated 
approach and 
to 
show the 
political 
and 
administrative 
will 
to improve 
its 
liveability 
and 
responsiveness 
to 
its 
citizens. 
In 
that 
regard, 
this 
partnership 
would 
not 
only 
have 
great 
demonstration 
value 
for 
China, 
as 
well 
as 
for 
the 
region, 
but 
would 
also  have  the 
subsidiary 
effect 
of 
providing 
valuable 
inputs 
to 
the 
Banks 
pool 
of 
learning 
and 
knowledge 
with 
regard 
to metropolitan 
development. 
It 
is 
important 
to 
note here that the 
developing 
world, 
and 
particularly 
Asia, 
needs 
a 
success 
story 
with 
regard 
to 
metropolitan 
development. 
Sustainable 
long-term financing 
would 
be 
essential 
to 
meet the 
significant 
investment 
programs 
for 
the 
environment 
improvements 
SMG 
plans 
over 
the 
next 
decade. 
SMG 
recognized 
that the 
current 
funding 
methods 
using 
short-term 
funding 
for most 
long-term 
investment commitments 
is 
risky, 
inefficient 
and 
not 
sustainable. 
Hence, 
SMG 
has 
decided, 
with 
central 
government 
support, 
to 
develop 
a 
more 
responsive 
and 
innovative framework 
for 
infrastructure financing. 
This 
conceptual framework, "Financial 
Policy 
Objectives and 
Financial 
Innovations," 
discussing 
challenges 
and innovations, 
is 
provided 
in 
Annex 
15.

Need 
for 
Access 
to Domestic 
Capital Markets 
One 
of 
the 
most 
important 
legacies 
of 
the  Shanghai 
Urban 
Environment 
Project 
APL 
would 
be 
the 
precedents 
it 
establishes 
for 
financing municipal-level 
environmental  infrastructure. 
Shanghai 
is 
the 
acknowledged 
leader 
in 
China 
of 
local financial 
innovations. 
Its 
initiatives, 
if 
successful 
in 
providing 
stable 
access 
to 
long-term  financing 
for 
environmental 
investments, 
will 
be  widely 
imitated. 
The 
financing 
agenda 
therefore 
should 
address 
issues 
that 
are 
high 
on 
the 
priority 
list 
not only 
for 
Shanghai 
but 
also 
for 
other 
metropolitan 
regions and 
should 
reinforce 
the 
national program 
of 
financial 
sector 
reform, 
as 
applied to 
the 
municipal 
sector. 
Infrastructure 
finance 
in 
China 
today 
is 
primarily 
arranged through: 
(a) 
short- and 
medium-term “policy 
lending” 
through 
the 
China 
Development 
Bank 
(CDB), 
funded 
through 
Policy  Financial 
Bonds 
periodically 
issued 
by CDB 
(in 
some 
cases 
issued 
by 
a 
commercial 
bank, 
after 
competitive 
bidding 
for 
the 
“policy 
lending” 
and corresponding 
bond 
issue)--normally 
with 
a 5- 
or 
10-year 
maturity--with 
an 
implicit 
government 
guarantee; 
(b) 
short-term (mostly 
3-, 
sometimes 5-year) 
commercial 
bank 
lending; 
and 
(c) 
on- and 
off-budget 
revenues. 
China 
has 
very 
limited 
experience 
with 
municipal 
bonds, 
including 
a 
brief 
surge 
of 
municipal bond 
issuance 
in 
the 
early 
1990s 
that 
led to 
a 
number 
of 
defaults 
or 
near-defaults 
by 
the 
original 
issuers. 
This 
experience 
led 
to 
imposition 
of 
tight 
regulatory controls 
on 
municipal 
bonds, 
which 
now 
require 
individual 
approval 
of 
the  State 
Development 
& 
Reform 
Commission 
(SDRC). 
The 
interest 
rates 
for 
lending 
as 
well 
as 
bond 
issues 
are 
regulated 
by 
the People’s 
Bank 
of 
China. 
Municipal 
governments 
are 
not allowed 
to 
borrow 
against 
general 
revenues, 
but 
it 
is 
possible 
for 
them to 
borrow 
for 
special 
projects through 
municipal 
investment 
companies,  such 
as 
the 
Shanghai 
Urban 
Development 
and 
Investment Company 
(UDIC). 
These companies act 
on 
behalf 
of 
the 
municipality 
to 
mobilize 
funding 
for 
municipal 
infrastructure and 
other investments. 
Budgetary 
resources 
have 
played 
a 
declining 
role 
in 
infrastructure finance 
in 
recent 
years. 
In 
order 
to 
be 
able 
to 
finance 
its 
environmental 
program, 
Shanghai 
authorities 
will 
have 
to 
tap 
the 
domestic 
capital 
markets 
utilizing 
new 
financial 
instruments.  Shanghai 
officials 
estimate that 
over 
the 
next 
five 
years 
they 
will 
have 
to 
finance 
Y40 
billion 
($4.85 
billion) 
in 
the 
broadly defined metropolitan 
water 
sector. 
Capital 
funding 
available 
from 
the 
municipal 
budget 
is 
estimated  at 
only 
Y3.5 
billion. 
Multilateral 
and 
international 
donor 
agencies 
will 
provide 
a 
small part 
of 
the 
gap, 
leaving 
the great 
bulk 
of 
financing 
to 
be 
raised 
from 
nonstate 
sources 
either 
in 
the 
form 
of 
debt 
or 
investor equity. 
At 
present, 
credits 
for 
municipal 
infrastructure investment 
financing 
are 
provided 
primarily 
by 
commercial 
banks’ 
three-year loans. 
Since 
construction 
can take 
at 
least 
two 
years, 
project 
revenues 
will 
not 
be available 
to 
repay the 
loan 
and 
it 
is 
known 
that 
such 
loans 
will 
have 
to 
be 
rolled 
over. 
The 
continuous 
rolling 
over 
of 
short-term 
bank 
loans 
to 
finance 
long-term 
investment projects 
creates 
serious 
risks. 
It 
exposes 
both 
the 
municipality 
and 
the 
banks 
to 
vulnerabilities 
in 
case 
rollover 
is 
not 
feasible-due, 
for 
example, 
to 
an 
economic 
slowdown. 
It 
also 
breaks 
the 
efficiency 
links 
between 
financing 
strategy 
and tariffs, 
since 
economically 
efficient 
water 
and wastewater 
tariffs 
cannot 
be structured 
to 
repay 
short-term 
borrowing. 
Shanghai 
realizes 
that 
it 
needs 
to 
broaden 
its 
access 
to 
capital 
and 
tap 
the domestic 
bond 
market. 
The 
Shanghai 
UDIC 
has 
previously 
issued bonds 
for 
manufacturing 
and 
transportation, 
but 
not 
for 
environmental 
purposes. 
Bond 
financing 
for 
environmental 
purposes 
would 
have 
several  advantages. 
These 
include:  lengthening 
tenure 
and 
better 
matching 
assets 
and 
liabilities, 
accessing 
long-term 
institutional 
savings 
(securing 
approval 
for 
insurance 
company 
purchase 
of 
a  Shanghai 
UDIC 
environmental 
bond 
issue 
will 
be 
sought 
and 
would 
represent 
a 
major 
breakthrough 
in 
sustainable 
capital 
financing), 
lowering 
interest 
rates, 
while 
exerting 
pressure 
on 
commercial 
banks 
to 
lengthen  their 
infrastructure 
finance 
lending 
periods 
in 
order 
to 
remain 
competitive. 
One 
of 
the 
APL 
project 
objectives 
is 
to 
launch 
a 
program 
of 
regular 
municipal 
enterprise 
bond 
issuance 
to 
help 
finance 
local 
environmental 
-10- 
Page  15
investment. 
The 
bond 
issuer 
will 
be 
the 
Shanghai 
Water 
Assets 
Operation 
and 
Development Company 
(SWAOD), 
a 
sectoral subsidiary 
of 
the Shanghai 
UDIC. 
The 
first 
bond 
issue 
is 
planned 
for 
about 
mid-2005 
(see 
Annex 
15). 
This 
will 
give 
the 
Program 
ample 
time to 
work 
with 
SWAOD 
in 
preparing 
an 
institutional 
business 
plan,  a debt 
management 
policy, 
and a 
projection 
of 
future 
tariff 
increases necessary 
to 
service 
all of 
SWAOD’s 
debt 
from 
service 
revenues. 
All 
of 
these 
elements 
of 
long-term 
finance 
planning 
are 
now 
absent. 
A 
series 
of SWAOD 
bond 
issues, 
backed 
by 
full 
disclosure 
of 
SWAOD 
finances 
and 
sources 
of 
debt-service 
revenue 
in 
Offering 
Statements, also 
should 
help 
establish a responsible 
municipal-level 
bond 
market 
in 
China. 
In 
the 
past, 
bonds 
have been 
issued 
with 
virtually 
no 
financial 
disclosure, 
creating 
the 
expectation 
of 
implied 
government 
guarantees. 
Establishment 
of 
a 
well-functioning 
municipal 
bond 
market 
is 
one  element 
in 
deepening 
capital 
markets, 
improving 
disclosure 
standards 
in 
financial 
transactions, 
and 
moving 
toward project 
finance, 
all 
of 
which 
are 
primary 
financial 
sector 
reform 
goals 
shared 
by 
the 
Government 
and 
the 
World 
Bank. 
The 
suburban 
districts 
of 
Shanghai face 
even  greater  obstacles 
than  the  core 
city 
in 
raising 
stable, 
long-term financing 
for 
environmental  infrastructure 
investment. 
The 
second 
major 
objective 
of 
the 
financial 
component 
of 
the 
APL 
is 
to 
use 
Shanghai’s 
strength 
to 
help 
districts 
secure 
long-term financing 
at 
reasonable 
costs 
for 
their 
key 
environmental 
investments. 
National 
policy, 
as 
well 
as 
Shanghai 
municipal policy, 
discourages 
subsidizing districts’ 
investments 
from 
the 
municipal 
budget. 
Districts 
are 
intended 
to 
be 
self-financing 
levels 
of 
government 
as 
regards 
capital 
budgets. 
Under 
the 
APL, 
however, 
Shanghai 
Municipality 
and 
the 
districts 
recognize 
their  environmental 
interdependence. 
They 
have 
agreed 
to 
establish a 
District 
Financing Vehicle 
(DFV), 
to 
operate 
on 
commercial 
terms, 
that 
will 
help 
the 
districts 
raise 
long-term financing 
from 
the market. 
Several  models 
for 
the 
DFV 
were 
considered 
during 
project 
preparation. 
One 
could 
operate 
as 
a 
metropolitan-scale 
Municipal 
Development 
Fund, 
passing 
on 
portions 
of 
the 
Bank’s 
SHUEP 
loan 
as 
well 
as 
domestically 
raised 
funds, 
to 
the 
districts. 
A 
second 
model could involve 
a 
joint 
venture 
between 
the 
Shanghai 
UDIC 
and a nonstate 
partner, 
formed 
to 
invest 
in 
district 
environmental projects. 
Under 
a 
third 
model 
the 
DFV 
could 
establish 
lines 
of 
credit 
with 
participating commercial

so 
that 
projects 
approved 
by 
the 
DFV 
as 
technically 
feasible and 
cost 
efficient, 
and 
then 
given 
a 
credit 
enhancement such 
as 
municipal 
budget 
intercept authority, 
would 
automatically 
qualify 
for 
long-term commercial bank 
financing. 
Under 
Phase 
One 
of 
the 
APL, 
a Steering  Committee, 
headed 
by 
the  Shanghai 
UDIC, 
and 
including 
representatives 
of 
the 
Construction 
Commission, 
Planning 
Commission, Finance 
Bureau, and 
local 
banks, 
would 
define 
the 
institutional 
structure 
and 
modus 
operandi 
of 
the 
DFV. 
All 
parties 
have 
expressed 
a 
preference 
for 
a 
straightforward, 
low-risk 
design that 
could 
respond 
quickly to 
districts’ 
financing 
needs, 
while 
relying 
on 
the 
nonstate  sector 
for 
financing. 
The 
DFV 
would 
be 
formally 
established 
and 
begin 
operation 
in 
Phase 
Two.

Program 
Area. 
The 
program 
area 
comprises Shanghai 
Municipality 
(SM), 
with 
particular 
emphasis 
on 
(a) 
the 
core 
urban 
area; 
and 
(b) 
the 
Upper 
Huangpu 
Catchment, 
which 
is 
the 
principal 
source 
of 
water 
for 
the 
city. The 
urban 
area, 
of 
Shanghai, 
had 
a 
population 
of 
9.6 
million 
in 
November 
2000, 
with 
a 
density 
of 
14,500 
persons 
per 
square 
kilometer 
(pkm2); 
the suburban 
areas 
had 
a 
population 
of 
some 
6.8 
million 
(1,200 
p/km2) 
giving 
a 
total populatuion 
of 
16.4 
million 
(2,586 
p/km2). 
The jurisdictional 
distinction 
between 
Shanghai 
City 
and 
suburban 
districts 
requires 
project 
design 
to 
address  the 
issue 
of 
metropolitan-level  environmental 
management 
and 
governance 
for 
the 
APL. 
While 
environmental 
infrastructure 
services 
(water, 
wastewater, 
solid 
waste) are 
provided 
in 
Shanghai 
City 
by SMG 
agencies, 
responsibilities 
for 
investment, 
tariff-setting, 
asset 
management 
and 
service 
delivery

lie 
with 
suburban 
District 
Governments  and 
Chongming 
County 
(the 
single 
remaining

in 
Shanghai

both 
the 
Shanghai 
Municipal

During 
APL1, 
the 
project 
would 
help 
Shanghai 
Municipality 
(SM) 
to 
develop 
policies 
that 
would 
allow 
it 
to 
withdraw 
gradually 
from 
being 
a service 
provider 
in 
the 
environmental  infrastructure 
services sectors 
to 
that 
of 
a 
facilitator 
of 
such services. 
In 
this 
respect, 
SMG 
would 
arrange 
for 
the 
following: 
(a) 
the 
formulation 
of 
a 
preliminary 
plan 
and 
prospectus 
for 
the  issuance 
of 
long-term 
municipal 
infrastructure 
bonds 
to 
replace 
the 
traditional 
counterpart 
funding 
sources 
of 
tax 
and other 
receipts 
and  short-term  commercial 
bank 
loans; 
(b) 
the  development 
of 
improved 
integrated 
institutional 
arrangements 
between 
SMG 
serving 
the 
urban 
core 
area 
and 
the 
nine 
suburban 
districts 
(and 
one 
rural 
county) 
within 
SM 
concerning 
the 
planning, 
design, 
financing 
and  operation 
of 
environmental  infrastructure, 
including 
arrangements 
for 
the 
feasibility 
of 
establishing 
a 
district 
financing 
vehicle 
to 
help 
finance  the 
districts’ 
needs, 
including 
using 
a 
portion 
of 
long-term 
infrastructure 
bonds 
proceeds 
as 
counterpart 
funds 
in 
future; 
(c) 
a  demonstration 
program 
of 
environmental infrastructure 
services 
upgrading 
in 
an 
underserved 
area 
of 
the 
core 
urban 
area; 
(d) 
the 
development 
of 
an 
administrative 
framework 
and 
draft 
implementing 
regulations 
for 
service/management  contracts 
and/or 
concessions 
with 
the 
objective 
of

a 
social 
participation 
contract 
for 
a 
wastewater treatment and/or 
solid 
waste 
facility; 
(e) 
the 
initiation 
of 
a 
study, 
including 
water 
quality 
modeling, 
on 
agricultural 
pollution 
control 
options  and 
strategies 
supported 
by 
a 
social 
assessment 
on 
policy 
impacts; and 
(f) 
the 
initiation 
of 
a study 
on 
the 
feasibility 
of 
improving 
air quality 
in 
Shanghai. 
The 
APLl 
project 
would 
have the following 
components: 
(a) 
facilities 
for 
the 
collection, 
treatment 
and 
disposal 
of 
municipal 
wastewater 
from 
the 
areas 
of 
Baoshan, 
Yangpu, 
Hongkou 
and Pudong 
located 
in 
the 
urban 
area 
of 
Shanghai; 
(b) 
environmentally 
secure 
municipal solid

which 
is 
facing 
strong 
pressure 
for 
redevelopment; 
(d) 
protection 
of 
water resources 
in 
the 
Upper Huangpu 
Catchment, 
through 
providing 
facilities 
in 
Jinshan 
and 
Fengxian  Districts 
for 
treatment

wastes; 
and 
(e) 
strengthening 
of 
institutions 
with 
responsibility 
for 
environmental 
management, 
including 
executive 
capacity 
building. 
By

About 
500,000 
people 
in 
underserved 
areas 
have 
benefited 
from 
improved 
environment 
services 
under the 
urban 
planning 
and 
upgrading 
component 
of 
APLl 
and 
APL2. 
(a) 
Solid 
waste services 
covering 
at 
least 
25 
percent 
of 
the 
total 
volume 
of 
solid 
wastes 
in 
the 
urban 
areas 
of 
Shanghai 
Municipality 
are 
managed 
by 
corporate  entities;  and 
(b) 
SMG 
has 
adopted 
an 
administrative 
framework 
and 
implementing 
regulations 
for 
the 
execution 
of 
service 
or 
management 
or 
concession 
contracts 
for 
solid 
waste services. 
The institutional 
capacity 
and resources 
of 
the Shanghai 
Water 
Authority 
have been increased 
to 
enable 
it 
to 
carry 
out 
its 
responsibility  for: 
(a) 
the 
planning 
and 
investment 
strategies 
for 
urban 
environmental 
services 
related 
to 
water,  wastewater 
and 
drainage 
across 
the 
entire 
municipal 
area; 
and 
(b) 
the preparation and 
implementation 
of 
the 
Upper Huangpu 
Catchment Management Plan. 
Environmentally 
acceptable 
and 
sustainable sludge management 
practices have been 
introduced 
in 
all 
commissioned 
and operational 
wastewater treatment 
plants 
in 
Shanghai. 
SMG 
has 
prepared a 
time-bound action 
plan 
for 
improving 
air quality 
in 
Shanghai 
During 
APL3, 
SMG  will 
expect  to: 
(a) 
issue 
long-term 
bonds 
to 
finance 
its 
environmental 
infrastructure 
needs; 
(b) 
benefit 
from 
enhanced 
integrated 
institutional 
arrangements 
with 
suburban 
district 
governments;  (c) 
corporatize 
more 
if 
its 
solid 
waste management operations; 
(d) 
improve 
the 
environment 
of 
its 
lower 
income 
inhabitants 
through 
upgraded 
environmental infrastructure 
services; 
and 
(e) 
improve 
the 
quality 
of 
its 
water 
resources 
and 
air 
through specific 
investments. 
The 
APL3 
project 
would 
have  the  following 
components: 
(a) 
environmental  infrastructure 
improvements 
in 
the 
Upper  Huangpu 
Catchment; 
(b) 
rehabilitation 
of 
antiquated 
wastewater 
infrastructure; 
(c) 
redevelopment 
of 
depressed 
and 
derelict 
areas, 
containing 
a 
high 
proportion 
of 
low-income 
communities  and  large 
industrial 
communities, 
including 
housing: 
(d) 
first 
phase 
investments 
to 
address 
agricultural 
pollution 
control; 
(e) 
air 
quality 
management 
improvement 
investments; and 
(f) 
institutional 
and executive 
management 
strengthening 
and training. 
By 
the 
end 
of 
APL3, 
SMG will 
expect 
to 
have 
enhanced 
the  economic, 
financial, 
trade 
and 
manufacturing 
stature 
of 
SM 
through  achieving  environmental 
and 
institutional 
and 
financial 
improvements 
and 
services. 
It 
will 
expect 
to 
have become 
more 
of 
a service 
facilitator 
rather than 
a 
service 
provider. 
It 
will 
expect 
to 
have 
a 
cleaner 
environment 
leading 
to 
improved 
health 
for 
its 
citizens.

Key 
policy 
and 
institutional 
reforms 
supported 
by 
the project: 
Financial. 
Previous 
Bank-supported projects 
in 
Shanghai 
have 
engaged 
in 
significant  institutional 
reforms 
in 
the  water,  wastewater 
and 
solid 
waste  sectors. 
SMG 
was 
among  the 
first 
municipal 
governments 
in 
China 
to 
corporatize 
wastewater management 
operations and 
to 
implement 
a 
wastewater 
tariff 
at 
levels 
adequate 
to 
sustain the operation. 
It 
was 
also 
the 
first 
to 
implement 
successfully a 
citywide 
urban 
information 
system 
for 
the 
planning 
and 
management 
of 
urban construction. 
This 
process 
of 
policy 
and 
institutional innovation 
would 
continue 
under 
the 
project, 
grouped 
into 
the 
five 
themes 
mentioned 
in 
paragraph 
B2 
of 
this 
report. 
Some 
of 
the 
key 
policies 
and 
institutional reforms 
to 
be 
supported under 
APLl 
include: 
the 
strengthening 
of 
the 
SWA 
to 
direct 
municipal-wide 
water  resource 
management: 
corporatization 
of 
solid 
waste  management  services, 
enabling  regulations 
for 
service/management 
contracts 
andor 
concessions 
for 
a wastewater 
treatment 
facility or 
a 
solid 
waste service: enhanced 
tariffs 
for 
district 
wastewater companies; 
initiation 
of 
solid 
waste 
tariffs 
and 
charges 
in 
districts; and 
the design 
of 
the 
DFV.

3. 
Benefits and 
target 
population: 
The 
target 
population 
is 
all 
the residents 
of 
the 
Municipality, 
with 
a 
special 
operational 
focus 
on 
those 
who 
are 
un- 
or 
underserved 
by 
urban environment 
services. 
This 
operational concentration 
on 
un- 
and 
underserved 
areas 
is 
both 
a 
matter 
of 
equity 
and  a 
technically/economically 
valid 
way  to 
optimize 
efficiency 
of 
infrastructure 
investments  and 
environmental 
outcomes 
overall. 
The  lack 
of 
urban 
environment 
services 
adversely affects 
all 
residents 
in 
terms 
of 
its 
impact 
on 
the 
quality 
of 
life 
and 
the 
constraints 
to 
economic 
opportunity 
and 
growth. 
Health 
and other 
economic benefits 
from 
delivery 
of 
urban  environmental 
services 
are 
considerable, 
but 
not 
easily 
attributable; 
therefore 
economic 
costhenefit 
analyses 
are 
usually 
not 
attempted 
for 
individual 
infrastructure 
investments. 
Cost-effectiveness 
standards 
are 
applied 
to 
determine  the 
most 
effective 
investment 
choices. 
Recent 
country-wide 
studies 
have 
identified 
the 
emergence 
in 
China 
of 
a 
new 
class 
of 
urban 
poor,  larger 
in 
number 
than the 
old 
definition, 
with 
rising 
inequality 
and 
starker 
contrast 
between 
the haves 
and 
the 
have-nots, 
and 
a 
larger 
share 
of 
the 
poor  coming 
from 
those 
who 
are 
unemployed. 
The 
Shanghai 
authorities have 
identified 
an overlap 
between 
areas 
in 
the 
core 
city which 
are 
underserved 
or 
in 
need 
of 
major 
upgrading 
and 
those 
areas 
occupied 
by 
the 
relatively 
poorer 
sections 
of 
the 
population. 
Although 
not 
a 
part 
of 
a 
targeted 
poverty 
reduction 
program, 
the 
Shanghai 
urban environmental 
services strategy 
is 
expected 
to yield 
significant 
benefits 
to relatively 
poorer 
areas 
in 
the 
Municipality. 
Benefits 
of 
the 
program 
are 
expected 
to 
include: 
(a) 
creation 
of 
a sustainable 
mechanism 
for 
financing 
urban environment 
services 
infrastructure; 
(b) 
improvements 
to 
the water 
environment 
(and, 
to 
a lesser 
extent, 
to air 
quality); 
(c) 
more effective provision 
and 
operation 
of 
urban 
environment 
services; 
and 
(d) 
an 
effective 
system 
to 
assure 
sustainable  water  resource  management 
for 
the 
Municipality. 
Program 
activities 
are 
expected 
to 
also 
yield 
significant 
benefits 
in 
the 
form 
of 
protecting 
the 
key 
water 
sources 
for 
the 
metropolitan 
area 
in 
the upper 
reaches 
of 
the 
Huangpu River. 
4. 
Institutional 
and 
implementation 
arrangements: 
A 
program leading 
group 
has 
been 
established 
in 
SMG 
to 
provide 
policy 
guidance  and 
to 
monitor 
progress 
in 
pursuing 
the 
overall 
urban environment improvement 
strategy. 
Under 
the 
leading 
group 
there 
is 
an 
APL 
Project 
Office 
composed 
of 
representatives 
of 
the  Shanghai 
Development 
Planning 
Commission 
(SPC), 
the 
Shanghai 
Finance Bureau 
(SFB),  the 
Shanghai 
Water 
Authority 
(SWA), 
the 
Shanghai 
Construction and 
Management 
Commission 
(SCC), 
and 
representatives 
of 
a 
number 
of 
bureaus 
and 
implementing 
agencies. 
For 
APL1, 
the 
Project 
Office 
(PO) 
would 
be 
headed 
by 
SPC. 
The 
Shanghai 
Municipal 
Sewerage 
Company (SMSC),  together 
with 
the Shanghai 
Water 
& 
Environment Construction 
Company 
(SWEC), 
would 
implement 
the 
urban 
wastewater 
component. 
The 
Shanghai 
City 
Appearance 
& 
Environmental 
Sanitation 
Administration 
Bureau 
(SCAESAB) 
and 
the  Shanghai 
Chengtou 
Environment  Industry 
Development Company 
Limited 
(CEIC) 
would 
implement 
the 
urban 
solid 
waste management 
component. 
The 
Hongkou 
District 
Government 
(HDG) 
would 
implement 
a 
pilot 
infrastructure 
upgrading 
program, 
only 
after 
Bank 
review  and 
approval 
of 
resettlement 
action 
plans 
and  environmental 
assessments, 
prepared 
in 
accordance 
with 
Bank 
and Chinese practices 
and 
procedures. 
Hongkou 
would, 
in 
addition, 
prepare 
urban  upgrading 
proposals 
for 
implementation 
under 
APL2 
and 
APL3.  The 
wastewater 
collection, 
treatment  and 
disposal 
investments 
under 
the 
Upper Huangpu 
River 
Catchment 
would 
be 
implemented 
by 
wastewater  companies 
under 
the 
overall  coordination 
of 
the  Jinshan  and 
Fengxian 
District 
Governments, 
as 
follows: 
(a) 
the 
Fengxian 
District: 
by 
the 
Nanpai 
Sewerage 
Disposal 
Company 
Limited 
(NSDC) 
and 
(b) 
the 
Jinshan 
District: 
in 
Fengjing, 
by 
the 
Fengjing 
Water 
Purification 
Company 
Limited 
(FWPC);  and 
by 
the Jinshan 
Ocean 
Outfall 
Engineering 
General Company 
Limited 
(JOOC). 
Issuance 
of 
the 
long-term 
bonds 
has 
been 
assigned 
to 
SWAOD, which 
is 
responsible 
for 
raising 
finance 
for 
water 
and 
wastewater 
investments 
within 
the core 
city 
and 
will 
raise 
the 
counterpart 
financing 
for 
the 
-18- 
Page  23
wastewater 
components 
of 
APL. 
Responsibility 
for 
designing 
the 
district  financing 
vehicle 
has 
been 
assigned 
to 
the  Shanghai 
UDIC, 
which 
would 
arrange 
to 
administer 
APL 
onlending 
to 
districts 
for 
environmental improvement 
projects. 
The 
Shanghai 
International Tendering 
Company 
Limited 
(SITC) 
has 
been 
retained 
as 
the 
procurement 
agent 
for 
all 
aspects 
of 
civil 
and 
electrical 
and 
mechanical works 
requiring 
bidding 
through 
international 
competitive 
bidding 
(ICB) 
procedures. 
Construction 
management  services 
would 
be 
provided 
by 
international 
firms 
using 
joint 
internationalhational 
supervision 
teams. 
Onlending Arrangements: 
The 
proposed 
loan 
of 
$200 
million 
would 
be 
made 
to 
the 
People’s 
Republic 
of 
China. 
The 
loan 
would 
be 
for 
20 
years, 
including 
5 
years 
of 
grace, 
at the 
Bank’s 
standard interest rate 
for 
LIBOR-based 
US 
Dollar 
single-currency 
loans. 
The 
proceeds 
of 
the 
loan 
would 
be onlent 
to 
SM 
on 
the 
same 
terms 
and conditions 
as 
the 
Bank 
loan 
to 
China, 
including 
passing 
on 
the 
front-end 
fee 
and a 
commitment 
charge 
of 
0.75 
percent 
per 
year. 
SM 
would 
onlend 
part 
of 
the proceeds 
of 
the 
Bank 
loan 
to 
SMSC, and 
to district 
wastewater companies, 
through 
the 
district 
governments, 
for 
15 years 
including 
5 
years 
of 
grace, 
at 
an 
interest 
rate 
not 
less 
than the 
Bank’s rate 
to 
China 
plus 
SM’s 
portion 
of 
the 
front-end 
fee  and a 
commitment 
charge 
of 
0.75 
percent 
per 
year. 
SM 
would 
pass 
on 
the balance 
of 
the 
loan 
proceeds 
to 
the other 
implementing 
agencies 
through budgetary 
allocations. 
Financial 
Management: 
An 
assessment 
of 
project 
financial 
management 
including 
an 
assessment 
of 
the 
relevant 
revenue-earning 
implementing 
agencies 
was 
carried 
out 
prior 
to 
appraisal, 
to 
ensure 
that  the 
Bank’s 
minimum 
financial 
management 
requirements 
as 
stipulated 
in 
OP/BP 
10.02 
would 
be 
met. 
Traditional 
disbursement 
techniques 
would 
be 
used 
in 
accordance 
with 
an agreement 
reached 
between 
the 
Bank 
and 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Finance 
(MOF). 
To 
facilitate 
disbursements, 
a 
Special 
Account 
would 
be 
opened 
with 
an 
authorized allocation 
of 
$14 
million, 
equivalent 
to 
the 
estimated 
average 
four 
months’ 
expenditures 
to 
be 
financed 
by 
the 
Bank: 
the 
account 
would 
be 
opened 
in 
US 
Dollars 
in 
a 
bank 
acceptable 
to 
the 
Bank 
and 
be 
managed 
by 
SFB. 
Auditing 
Arrangements: 
As 
with 
other 
Bank 
Group-financed projects 
in 
China, 
the 
Foreign 
Investment 
Audit 
Bureau 
of 
the 
China 
National 
Audit 
Office 
(CNAO), 
established 
in 
1983 
under 
the 
name 
of 
State 
Audit 
Administration, 
would 
have 
overall responsibility 
for 
auditing 
the 
accounts 
of 
the project. 
The 
actual 
auditing 
work 
would 
be 
conducted 
by 
the 
Shanghai 
Municipal 
Audit 
Bureau 
under 
CNAO’s 
supervision. 
The 
Bank 
currently 
accepts 
audits 
performed 
under 
the 
responsibility 
of 
CNAO. 
Audits 
of 
the 
project 
accounts 
and 
the 
financial 
statements 
of 
implementing 
agencies 
and audits 
of 
the 
Special 
Account and 
Statements 
of 
Expenditures 
would 
be submitted 
to 
the 
Bank 
within 
six 
months 
after 
the 
end 
of 
the 
financial 
year. 
During 
appraisal, 
SMG 
confirmed 
that 
the 
audit 
reports 
of 
the 
implementing 
agencies 
would 
include 
opinions 
on 
whether  the 
agencies 
were 
in 
compliance 
with 
their 
respective 
financial 
covenants, 
and 
that 
these 
agencies have 
taken 
out 
adequate 
insurance 
on 
goods 
and 
works 
financed 
from 
loan 
proceeds. 
Monitoring 
and 
Evaluation 
Arrangements: 
The 
more routine 
aspects 
of 
monitoring 
are 
already 
in 
place. 
The 
Shanghai 
authorities 
are 
experienced 
in 
managing 
project 
investments 
following  Bank 
guidelines, and the 
PO 
would 
produce semiannual 
status 
reports 
for 
the 
Leading 
Group 
and 
for 
the 
Bank. 
The 
first 
such 
report 
would 
be 
submitted 
by 
January 
31, 
2004. 
Adequate 
systems 
and 
facilities 
are 
in 
place 
to 
monitor 
the 
quality 
of 
the water 
and 
air 
environment, 
and 
the 
project 
would 
assist 
in 
the 
use 
of 
geographical 
information 
systems (GIS) 
to 
enhance the management 
information 
systems 
for 
solid 
waste. 
The Tenth Five-Year Plan 
has 
established 
interim 
and 
final 
targets 
for 
environmental 
service 
delivery 
that 
can 
be 
monitored 
with 
existing 
management 
information 
systems 
in 
the 
various 
utilities 
and 
government 
bureaus, 
e.g., 
share 
of 
population 
served, 
share 
of 
sorted 
collection 
of 
domestic 
solid 
waste, 
-19- 
Page  24
share 
of 
wastewater collected, 
share 
of 
centralized 
treatment 
of 
food 
waste, 
m2 
of 
green 
space 
per 
capita, 
etc. 
The 
most 
important 
and 
challenging 
aspect 
of 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
would 
be 
tracking 
the pace 
toward 
fulfilling 
the 
overall 
development objectives, 
due 
to 
their longer-term nature and 
the 
interlinkages 
among 
phases 
and 
goals. 
Bank 
supervision 
would 
therefore 
give 
top 
priority to 
helping 
the Shanghai 
authorities 
understand 
the issues 
facing 
them, 
keep 
track 
of 
their 
progress, 
and 
maintain 
focus 
on 
what 
it 
takes 
to 
achieve 
their overall 
goals. 
Given 
the 
innovative 
nature 
of 
some 
project 
initiatives 
and sometimes 
highly 
technical 
features 
being 
investigated, 
Bank 
supervision 
would 
also 
need 
to 
provide 
expert guidance 
on 
some matters. 
Even 
though 
significant 
technical 
assistance 
is 
projected 
within 
the 
project, 
it 
is 
likely 
that 
the 
Bank would 
need 
to 
supplement 
its 
own 
expertise 
with 
world-class practitioners, 
particularly 
for 
overseeing the development 
of 
innovative financing 
arrangements. 
The supervision 
strategy 
would 
emphasize outcomes, 
continuity 
of 
expertise and 
maintaining 
a 
high 
caliber 
of 
Bank 
supervisory staff.

D. 
Project 
Rationale 
1. 
Project 
alternatives 
considered 
and 
reasons 
for 
rejection: 
The 
overall 
water 
consumption 
in 
Shanghai 
is 
currently 
estimated 
to 
be 
about 
8.5 
million 
cubic 
meters 
per 
day 
(Mm3lday): 
6.5 
Mm3/day 
in 
the Shanghai 
Municipal 
Waterworks Company 
(SMWC) 
service 
area; 
1.5 
Mm3lday 
in 
the 
suburbs 
and 
districts; and 
0.5 
MmYday 
from 
groundwater 
abstraction. 
The 
citywide 
wastewater generated 
is 
about 
5.75 
Mm3/day, 
including 
some 
0.7 
Mm3lday 
of 
groundwater 
infiltration. 
The 
present 
collection 
rate 
(percent 
of 
overall 
wastewater 
collected) 
is 
about 
68 
percent, 
of 
which 
24 
percent 
is 
discharged 
through 
sewers 
to 
the 
local river 
system, 
including 
the 
Suzhou Creek and 
Huangpu River, 
and 
48 percent 
is 
discharged 
following 
screening 
and 
gritting, 
and 
some 
treatment. 
Improved 
interceptors 
and 
collection 
capacity 
is 
clearly 
needed. 
About 
1.8 
Mm3lday 
(32 
percent) 
of 
wastewater generated 
flows directly 
to 
the 
local 
river 
system. These data 
imply 
a 
current 
system 
utilization 
rate (current 
flowldesign 
capacity and collected 
for 
possible 
- 
current 
and future 
- 
treatment) 
of 
about 
60 
percent. 
The 
present 
level 
of 
treatment 
(defined 
as 
a 
level 
higher 
than 
primary 
treatment) 
is 
11 
percent, 
which 
is 
low 
by 
comparison 
with 
other 
major 
Chinese 
cities. 
In 
the 
urban 
areas 
remaining 
to 
be 
sewered, 
a 
number 
of 
options 
ranging 
from 
localized 
wastewater 
treatment 
for 
each 
area 
to collection 
for 
conveyance 
to 
centralized 
treatment, 
were explored. 
SMG 
has 
decided 
to make 
use 
of 
existing 
wastewater 
assets 
that have 
additional 
capacity 
as 
a 
result 
of 
relocation 
and restructuring 
of 
industry. 
Therefore, 
the 
preferred 
option 
would 
be centralized 
treatment, 
which 
also 
would 
provide 
economies 
of 
scale 
and 
a 
lower 
unit 
cost. 
The overall 
principles 
of 
the 
updated 
Shanghai Wastewater 
Master 
Plan, 
prepared 
in 
draft 
and currently 
under 
review 
for 
approval, 
are 
as 
follows:

based 
on

to

possible. 
Sector Issue 
The 
total 
estimated 
wastewater 
flow 
for 
2020 
is 
8.5 
Mm3/d. The 
discharge standard 
and 
basis 
of 
control 
(total load 
control or 
concentration-based 
standards) 
need 
to 
be clarified 
before 
the treatment 
process 
selection 
can 
be 
finalized. 
It 
is 
of 
interest 
to 
note that 
the 
additional 
pollution 
load 
removed 
by 
secondary 
treatment 
is 
modest 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
assimilative 
capacity 
of 
the 
Yangtze 
River 
Estuary 
and 
the 
additional 
cost 
relative to 
chemical 
treatment 
is 
substantial. 
In 
particular, 
the 
chemical 
process 
is 
at 
least 
as 
effective 
as 
secondary 
treatment 
in 
the 
removal 
of 
phosphorus. 
Project 
The 
existing 
sludge management 
proposals 
require 
considerably 
more investigation 
because 
they 
do not 
currently 
demonstrate 
sustainability. 
Sludge 
treatment and 
disposal 
is 
such 
an 
important 
and 
costly 
issue 
that 
there 
needs 
to 
be 
a 
Municipality-wide 
Sludge Management 
Master Plan 
to 
develop 
an 
overall 
system 
that 
is 
both 
cost-effective 
and 
sustainable. 
This 
would 
be 
addressed 
during 
APL1. 
Implementation 
Progress (IP) 
The 
Shanghai 
Solid 
Waste 
Disposal 
Development  Plan 
identifies 
the 
broad 
range 
and 
quantity 
of 
different 
waste types 
that 
are 
generated 
in 
Shanghai. 
The 
present 
priorities 
of 
SCAESAB 
are 
to 
address 
domestic 
waste 
issues, 
expand 
landfill 
capacity 
and 
respond 
to 
a recent 
crisis 
in 
food 
waste disposal. 
Given 
the 
scarcity 
of 
landfill 
options 
in 
SM, 
the  strategy 
is 
to 
keep 
disposable 
waste 
quantities 
at 
approximately 
present 
levels 
through 
a 
waste 
reduction, 
resource 
recovery 
and 
recycling 
approach 
which 
may  include 
building 
incineration 
plants 
with 
energy 
recovery, 
composting 
plants,  and 
enhanced 
recycling 
by 
means 
of 
separation at 
source. 
For 
incineration 
to 
be 
economically 
viable,  the 
wet 
organic 
material 
of 
domestic 
waste, 
comprising two-thirds 
of 
the waste 
of 
Shanghai,  needs 
to 
be 
separated 
at 
source. 
Significant 
waste 
reduction 
in 
Shanghai 
can 
be 
achieved 
by 
composting, 
but 
the  cost 
of 
production 
would 
probably 
be 
considerably 
higher 
than  the 
market 
price 
of 
soil 
and 
not 
financially 
viable. 
However, 
from 
an 
overall 
economic 
point 
of 
view, 
composting 
may be 
the 
least-cost 
solution, 
when 
account 
is 
taken 
of 
the 
avoided 
cost 
of 
transportation 
and 
disposal. 
Moreover, 
SMG's ongoing 
greening 
program 
(not Bank-financed) 
could be 
a 
significant 
user 
of 
good-quality 
compost.

3. 
Lessons 
learned 
and reflected 
in 
the 
project 
design: 
Independent Projects 
Versus 
a 
Program 
Approach. 
The  Bank 
supported 
development 
of 
urban 
environmental 
services 
in 
Shanghai 
through 
three 
separate 
investment  projects--Shanghai 
Sewerage 
Project 
(SSP1, 
1987-93), 
Shanghai 
Environment 
Project 
(SEP, 
1994-2002) 
and 
Second 
Shanghai 
Sewerage 
Project 
(SSP2, 
1996-2003). 
Total 
investment 
costs 
amounted 
to nearly 
$1.4 
billion, 
with 
Bank 
financing 
of 
$555 
million. 
SSPl 
provided 
a catalyst 
for 
institutional 
and 
financial 
innovation 
in 
the 
drainage and 
sewerage 
subsector--with 
the 
creation 
of 
the Shanghai Sewerage 
Company, 
with 
powers 
to 
borrow 
and 
to 
charge 
for 
its 
services. 
However, 
even 
with 
the 
formal 
changes 
into 
company 
status, 
the 
company 
continued 
to 
operate 
as 
if 
it 
were 
still 
a government 
department, 
and 
introducing 
sewerage 
charges 
for 
households 
took 
longer 
than 
initially 
planned. 
Through 
SEP, 
the  Shanghai 
Municipal 
Government 
worked 
on 
water 
supply 
investments, 
while 
at 
the 
same 
time  reinforced  work  on 
identification 
and 
control 
of 
sources 
of 
pollution, 
improvements 
to 
municipal, environmental 
and 
utility 
management 
and 
finances, 
and 
supported 
training 
and 
technical 
assistance, 
including 
preparation 
of 
the 
Shanghai 
Environment 
Master 
Plan 
and 
the 
Hazardous 
Waste 
Management Study. 
During 
preparations 
for 
SSP2, 
the  Shanghai 
Municipal 
Government 
made 
further 
improvements 
to 
the 
institutional 
and 
financial 
arrangements 
in 
the 
sector, 
creating 
SMSC, 
installing 
new 
management 
and 
adjusting 
wastewater 
tariffs 
to 
achieve cost 
recovery. 
During 
the 
course 
of 
these 
three 
projects, 
it 
became 
clear that 
a 
longer-term 
framework 
was  necessary 
to 
guide 
work 
in 
the 
sector, 
in 
particular 
the 
policy 
and 
institutional 
reforms, where 
it 
is 
an 
iterative 
process, 
and the 
pace 
of 
reforms 
can 
be 
uneven 
and 
at 
times 
out 
of 
sync 
with 
each other. 
Trying 
to 
justify 
individual 
projects 
and 
investments against 
an 
institutional 
reform 
agenda 
that 
was 
still 
evolving 
was 
confusing 
to 
the 
Shanghai 
authorities and undermined 
the 
Bank's 
ability 
to 
engage 
constructively 
with 
a 
longer-term 
perspective. 
However, 
these 
three 
projects 
did 
help 
create 
enough  ingredients 
and 
experience 
for 
the  Shanghai 
authorities 
to 
move 
to 
a 
program 
approach, 
where the 
driving 
elements 
are 
no 
longer 
justifying 
individual 
investments, 
but 
rather 
how 
to 
build 
up 
the 
policies, institutions 
and 
infrastructure 
to 
contribute 
to 
the 
economic and social 
development 
goals 
of 
the 
city. 
Greater 
Reliance 
on 
User 
Charges. 
A 
major 
finding 
from 
the 
Operations 
and 
Evaluation 
Department 
(OED) review 
of 
water and 
sanitation projects 
across 
all 
countries 
has 
been 
generally 
good 
achievement 
of 
physical 
targets 
but 
less 
success 
in 
sustaining 
the 
financial viability 
of 
municipal 
environmental 
service 
providers. 
The 
recent 
OED 
review 
of 
all 
Bank-financed 
water supply 
and 
wastewater 
projects 
in 
China confirmed 
that 
these 
findings 
also 
apply 
to 
Chinese projects.  Therefore,  based 
on 
earlier 
sector 
work 
for 
China 
("Urban 
Environmental 
Service 
Management," 
Report 
No. 
13073-CHA) 
the 
Bank 
is 
constructively 
engaged 
with 
the 
Chinese 
authorities 
about the 
need 
for 
greater 
reliance 
on 
user 
charges, 
-23- 
Page  28
which 
are 
currently 
set 
by 
most 
borrowers 
at 
levels 
that 
would 
not 
sustain 
the 
services. 
In 
the 
case 
of 
SMSC, 
however, 
SMG 
has 
regularly 
authorized 
wastewater 
tariffs 
to 
be adjusted 
to 
ensure 
its 
financial 
viability 
and 
SMSC 
has 
been 
in 
full 
compliance 
with 
its 
financial 
covenants 
under 
SSP2 
over 
the past 
four 
years. 
In 
the course 
of 
preparing 
the 
series 
of 
APLs, 
Bank 
dialogue 
with 
the Shanghai authorities 
has 
progressed even 
further,  evidenced 
by 
SMGs 
commitment 
to  establish 
appropriate 
tariffs 
for 
urban 
environmental 
services 
across 
the 
metropolitan 
area, 
as 
a 
key 
building 
block to 
arranging 
for 
private 
participation 
in 
urban  environment  infrastructure 
services 
as 
well 
as 
to 
opening 
these 
utilities  to 
opportunities 
for 
project 
finance 
on 
the 
capital 
markets. 
Support 
for 
Institutional Management. 
The 
establishment 
of 
financially 
autonomous 
utility 
enterprises 
to 
develop  and 
manage 
urban 
services 
is 
a 
long-standing 
Chinese 
practice, 
and 
avoids 
many 
of 
the 
management 
difficulties 
of 
publicly-owned 
utilities 
in 
other 
countries. 
While 
wastewater 
collection 
and 
treatment 
has 
only 
recently 
been 
given 
the 
same 
autonomy, 
generally 
by 
organizing 
the 
existing 
drainage 
bureaus 
and 
construction 
management 
units 
into 
separate 
enterprises, 
SMG 
has 
already 
demonstrated 
its 
commitment 
to 
the 
concept 
of 
financial 
autonomy 
by 
establishing SMSC, 
which 
continues 
to 
perform 
well--institutionally,  financially 
and technically. 
The 
establishment 
of 
district 
wastewater  companies 
in 
Jinshan  and 
Fengxian 
Districts 
prior  to 
project 
implementation 
would 
provide  sufficient 
time 
for 
management 
and 
operational 
issues 
for 
these 
district-owned 
utilities 
to 
be 
clarified. 
4. 
Indications 
of 
borrower 
commitment 
and 
ownership: 
Shanghai’s 
vision 
is 
now 
to 
become 
one 
of 
the 
world’s  major 
megacities, 
as 
a 
competitive global 
municipality. 
It 
intends 
to 
accelerate 
its 
development 
to 
become  a first-class 
intemational 
economic, 
financial, 
trade 
and 
shipping 
center, 
vigorously 
pursuing 
institutional 
innovation 
and 
comprehensive 
city 
management. 
The 
city’s 
“corporate 
plan”  includes 
objectives 
to 
enhance 
the 
existing 
infrastructure 
to 
meet the 
demands 
of 
population 
growth 
and 
achieve the 
highest 
standards 
of 
urban 
environment. 
Shanghai 
has 
also 
committed 
to 
further modernizing 
its 
management, 
establishing 
an 
integrated 
legal 
framework 
for 
urban 
management, 
with 
rational 
division 
of 
responsibilities among 
local 
jurisdictions 
(cities,  districts, 
and 
towns), 
and 
accelerate the 
development 
of 
new 
investment and 
financing 
systems 
with 
diversified 
market-based instruments. 
The Letter 
of

Value 
added 
of 
Bank 
support 
in 
this 
project: 
The 
Bank 
brings 
considerable 
international 
experience 
in 
terms 
of 
assisting 
policy 
formulation 
and 
investment 
program 
design. 
Bank 
assistance 
will 
also 
draw 
upon our 
growing 
experience 
in 
addressing 
regional 
environmental 
issues 
in 
priority 
environmental improvement projects 
in 
China, 
including 
the 
cleanup 
of 
Dianchi 
Lake 
(as 
part 
of 
the 
Yunnan 
Environment 
Project), the 
Huai 
River 
Basin 
and 
the 
Liao 
River 
Basin 
in 
Liaoning 
Province, 
all 
included 
in 
China’s 
priority 
“three 
rivers, 
three 
lakes” 
program. 
The Bank 
has 
a 
long 
and 
productive 
collaboration 
with 
SMG 
in 
improving 
the 
city’s urban 
environment 
and 
infrastructure. 
Past 
Bank-supported 
operations 
have 
engaged 
in 
significant 
institutional 
reforms 
in 
the 
water, wastewater, 
transport 
and 
energy sectors 
in 
Shanghai.

NPV=US$

Annex

This 
APL 
is 
designed 
as 
support 
to 
one 
of 
the 
specific macro objectives 
of 
SMG, 
as 
set 
out 
in 
the 
Tenth 
Five-Year Plan 
and 
associated documents. 
As 
such, 
its 
overall 
objective 
would 
be 
to 
help 
Shanghai 
to 
achieve 
its 
overall growth 
targets 
both while 
protecting 
the 
environment 
of 
the 
city 
and 
by 
improving 
the 
environment 
of 
the 
city for 
the 
benefit 
of 
its 
citizens 
and 
to 
attract 
business 
and visitors. 
The 
investments  proposed 
under 
the 
APL 
would 
provide 
environmental improvements 
and 
associated 
economic 
benefits 
to 
the 
city, 
by 
improving 
the 
quality 
of 
ambient water and 
air 
in 
the 
urban 
core, 
and 
water 
quality 
in 
the 
Upper Huangpu 
Catchment, 
and 
by 
upgrading 
the 
living 
environment through better 
solid 
waste management 
and 
improving 
services 
in 
underserved 
areas. 
However, 
it 
is 
difficult 
to 
put 
a 
value 
on 
incremental 
improvements 
in 
environmental 
quality 
and 
it 
is 
even 
more 
challenging 
to 
attribute 
such 
improvements 
to 
specific 
interventions.  Therefore, 
although 
there 
would 
be 
measurable 
reductions 
in 
pollution 
loads 
associated 
with 
the 
investments and 
there 
would 
be 
specific 
physical 
improvements, 
it 
is 
not 
possible 
to 
calculate 
an 
EER 
for 
the 
project 
as 
a 
whole. 
For 
the 
major 
investments 
in 
wastewater 
and 
in 
solid 
waste management, 
the 
appropriate 
criterion 
is 
cost-effectiveness. 
The 
wastewater 
investments 
are 
intended 
to 
complete  the 
backlog 
of 
sewerage 
of 
Shanghai 
City 
by 
intercepting 
discharges 
to 
the 
urban 
creeks 
and 
talung 
the 
flows 
to 
points 
where they 
can 
be 
discharged 
back 
into 
the 
environment, 
with 
appropriate 
treatment, 
at the least 
overall 
system 
cost. 
This 
approach 
is 
based 
on 
a 
strategy that 
was 
established 
in 
1985 at 
the 
time 
of 
the 
first 
Bank 
support 
for 
urban 
water 
protection 
in 
Shanghai 
(SSP1) 
and that 
was 
endorsed 
at 
the 
time 
of 
the 
second 
major 
Bank 
project 
in 
the 
sector 
(SSP2). 
Changes 
to 
the 
regulatory 
requirements, 
which 
are 
under  discussion  at 
present, 
are 
adding 
complication 
to 
the analysis 
but 
the 
principle 
of 
cost effectiveness remains the 
same. 
The 
water 
quality 
in 
the 
main 
urban 
waterways 
has 
demonstrated considerable 
improvement over 
the 
period 
of 
SSPl 
and 
SSP2 
and 
this 
has 
provided 
clear economic benefits 
in 
terms 
of 
both 
amenity and 
property 
value, 
but 
valuation and 
attribution 
of 
these 
benefits 
is 
not 
possible. 
The main 
investment 
in 
solid 
waste 
is 
for 
an 
increase 
in 
the 
disposal 
capacity, 
by 
expanding 
the 
existing 
major 
landfill. 
This 
is 
again 
based 
on 
a 
least-cost 
approach 
but 
the 
project 
includes 
support 
to 
the 
relevant  authorities 
to 
begin 
to 
calculate 
and 
use 
marginal 
disposal 
cost  estimates 
for 
different 
components 
of 
the 
solid 
waste system, 
so 
as 
both 
to 
optimize 
the 
use 
of 
the 
system and 
to 
provide 
signals 
to 
waste generators 
of 
the 
real 
costs 
of 
their activities. 
The 
pilot 
urban upgrading activities 
are 
intended 
to 
help 
Shanghai 
to 
improve 
urban planning, 
identify 
and 
implement 
improvements 
that 
do 
bring 
clear  economic  benefits 
to 
its 
citizens 
and  therefore 
assessment 
of 
the 
benefits 
would 
be 
an 
essential 
part 
of 
the 
activities 
supported. 
However, 
since 
these 
interventions 
are 
currently 
at 
the 
pilot 
scale, 
it 
is 
not 
possible 
to 
estimate 
the 
economic 
rate 
of 
return 
for 
these 
Phase 
1 
activities. 
The 
Upper 
Huangpu 
Catchment  Management 
Program 
is 
intended 
to 
protect 
the  water 
supply 
for 
Shanghai 
and 
as 
such 
has 
a 
large 
potential 
benefit, 
in 
terms 
of 
costs 
avoided. 
As 
the 
Program 
proceeds, 
estimates 
would 
be 
made 
of 
this 
benefit. 
It 
is 
not 
possible 
to 
define 
a 
relationship between specific 
- 
25 
- 
Page  30
interventions 
and benefits 
(in 
tenns 
of 
postponing 
water 
supply 
expenditures) 
and therefore 
the approach 
to 
be 
adopted 
is 
the 
identification 
of 
key 
parameters 
[probably 
chemical oxygen 
demand 
(COD) 
and 
nutrients] 
and the 
evaluation 
of 
potential 
investments 
in 
terms 
of 
cost 
effectiveness 
in 
reducing 
the 
levels 
of 
those 
pollutants. 
The 
marginal 
cost 
would 
be 
estimated 
(in 
the 
form 
of 
average 
incremental 
costs) 
for 
different 
interventions 
and compared 
with 
each 
other and 
with 
typical 
costs 
for 
other 
schemes. These 
average 
incremental 
cost 
figures 
would 
then 
provide 
benchmarks 
for 
assessing 
options and 
interventions. 
2. 
Financial 
(see 
Annex 
4 
and Annex 
5): 
NPV=US$  million; 
FRR 
= 
% 
(see 
Annex 
4) 
The 
base 
cost estimates 
of 
the 
project reflect preliminary 
engineering 
designs 
and 
price 
levels 
prevailing 
in 
March 
2003. 
The 
unit 
prices were 
derived 
from 
the 
following 
sources: 
(a) 
quotations 
obtained 
from 
manufacturers and 
suppliers; 
(b) 
prices 
of 
goods 
and works 
from 
recent 
contracts; 
and 
(c) 
construction 
costs 
according 
to 
prices 
published 
by 
the 
central and 
Shanghai governments, 
all 
adjusted 
for 
inflation. 
Physical 
contingencies 
have been 
applied 
to 
civil 
works 
base 
costs 
at the 
rate 
of 
8 
percent, based 
on 
the 
experience 
of 
SMSC 
and 
SWEC 
in 
project 
implementation 
under 
past 
Bank-financed 
projects,  where 
physical 
contingencies 
have been 
in 
the range 
of 
5 
to 
7 
percent. 
This 
is 
due 
mainly 
to 
ground 
conditions 
(absence 
of 
rock) 
and 
the 
quality 
of 
detailed 
design. 
Construction supervision 
services costs 
have 
been 
included 
in 
the 
project 
cost estimates. 
Project 
management 
and 
engineering 
overhead 
costs 
of 
about 
10 
percent 
are 
also 
included. Price 
contingencies 
have been 
applied 
to 
expenditures  at 
projected global 
foreign 
and 
local 
inflation 
rates, 
as 
follows: local: 
2.0 
percent 
in 
2003 
and 
2004 
and 
3.0 
percent 
in 
2005 
and 
thereafter; 
foreign: 
1.7 percent 
in 
2003, 
2.2 percent 
in 
2004 and 
2.0 
percent 
in 
2005 
and 
thereafter. 
The dolladyuan 
exchange 
rate 
has 
been 
assumed 
to 
vary 
in 
order 
to maintain 
purchasing 
power 
parity. 
The financial 
objectives 
set 
by 
SMG 
for 
its 
wastewater 
utility 
entities 
are 
to 
achieve at least 
full 
cost 
recovery 
on 
their 
operations 
and, 
in 
the 
case 
of 
SMSC, 
to 
also  make  a 
contribution 
to 
its 
capital 
investment 
program 
from 
internally 
generated sources. 
SMSC 
and the 
districts 
have 
enacted wastewater 
tariffs sufficient 
to 
meet 
SMGs 
financial 
objectives 
for 
2003. 
Within 
the 
provisions 
of 
the 
current 
national Price 
Law, 
SMG 
plans 
to 
further 
reform 
its 
tariff 
setting 
procedures, 
as 
follows: 
0 
0 
0 
Codify 
the 
price 
structures 
of 
its 
service 
providers; 
Have 
various 
sector representatives 
work 
with 
the 
Price 
Monitoring 
and 
Supervising Department 
for 
the purpose 
of 
malung price 
setting more 
transparent 
and 
responsive 
to 
needs; 
and 
Make 
the 
price 
setting 
process 
more 
accessible 
to 
the 
public. 
Fiscal 
Impact: 
Shanghai 
municipal 
on-  and 
off-budget 
receipts 
and 
expenditures 
in 
2001 totaled 
about Y49.8 
billion 
($6.0 
billion 
equivalent) 
and 
Y72.6 
billion 
($8.8 
billion 
equivalent), 
respectively. 
The 
central 
government, 
in 
keeping 
with 
the 
current 
fiscal 
arrangements 
between 
the 
central and 
local 
governments, 
transfers 
an 
amount 
to 
Shanghai. 
Taken 
together, 
Shanghai 
enjoys 
a  modest 
surplus. 
Receipts  and 
expenditures 
are 
both 
projected 
to 
grow 
at about 
10 
percent 
per 
year 
in 
current 
terms, 
respectively. 
SMG 
expects 
to 
pass 
on 
about 
82 
percent 
of 
the 
Bank 
loan 
proceeds 
to 
financially 
autonomous 
wastewater 
entities. 
Should 
these 
entities 
be unable 
to 
fulfill 
their 
obligations, 
SMG 
would 
have 
no 
difficulty 
in 
covering 
debt 
service 
through 
its 
own 
resources 
as 
the debt service represented 
by 
the 
project 
is 
small 
compared 
to 
total 
municipal 
receipts. 
SMG 
would 
provide 
all 
funding 
not met 
by 
(a) 
the 
proceeds 
of 
the 
Bank 
loan, 
(b) 
district 
contributions, 
and 
(c) 
funds 
generated 
internally 
by 
the 
implementing 
agencies. 
Prior 
to 
appraisal, 
SMG 
independently 
assessed 
the 
districts’ 
ability 
to 
generate 
their  required 
- 
26 
- 
Page  31
counterpart 
funds 
from 
assured sources 
and 
have 
found 
these 
satisfactory. 
3. 
Technical: 
The 
proposed 
physical 
investments 
were 
designed 
by 
first-class  Chinese 
design institutes, 
taking 
into 
account 
the 
latest 
Ministry 
of 
Construction 
(MOC) 
design standards. 
The 
engineering 
designs and 
bid 
documents 
were 
reviewed 
by 
international 
consultants  and 
found 
to 
be 
satisfactory. 
The 
technologies 
involved 
are 
proven 
and 
within 
the 
capability 
of 
Chinese 
contractors and manufacturers 
if 
successful 
in 
winning 
bids. 
4. 
Institutional: 
4.1 
Executing 
agencies: 
The 
self-funding, 
self-accounting 
state-owned  Shanghai 
Municipal 
Sewerage 
Company  (SMSC) 
was 
established 
in 
December 
1995, 
following 
the merger 
of 
the 
existing 
Shanghai 
Sewerage 
Company 
and 
the 
Shanghai  Sewerage 
Project Construction 
Company 
(SSPCC). 
Since 
its 
establishment, 
SMSC 
has 
performed 
well, 
institutionally, financially 
and 
technically. 
In 
2000, 
and 
as 
part 
of 
SMG’s 
restructuring 
initiatives, 
SMSC 
was 
reorganized, 
creating 
three 
operating 
companies 
and 
the 
Shanghai 
Water 
& 
Environment 
Construction Company 
(SWEC), 
while 
retaining 
the 
SMSC Group 
Company. 
The SMSC 
Group 
Company retains 
all 
wastewater 
assets, 
and 
hires the 
operating 
companies 
on 
a 
contract 
basis 
to 
undertake 
operation  and 
maintenance 
of 
the 
sewerage 
facilities.  The 
role 
of 
SWEC 
is 
that 
of 
a 
construction-engineering 
firm 
(similar 
to 
the 
role 
of 
SSPCC 
in 
the 
First 
Shanghai 
Sewerage 
Project--Loan 
2794-CWCredit 
1779-CHA). 
SMSC 
and 
SWEC 
report 
to 
the Shanghai 
Water 
Authority 
(SWA), 
established 
in 
2000, 
combining 
the 
former 
Water 
Conservancy Bureau, the Shanghai 
Municipal 
Waterworks  Company  (SMWC), 
and 
SMSC 
Group 
Company. 
(Previously 
SMWC 
reported 
to 
the 
Shanghai 
Public 
Utilities 
Bureau,  and 
SMSC 
reported 
to 
the 
Shanghai 
Municipal 
Engineering 
Bureau.) 
S 
WA 
reports 
to 
the 
Municipal 
Construction 
and Management 
Commission. 
Project 
implementation responsibilities 
are 
as 
follows: 
(a) 
urban 
wastewater component--SMSC/SWEC, 
the 
latter acting 
on behalf 
of, 
and 
under contract 
to 
SMSC; 
(b) 
urban 
solid 
waste 
component--SCAESAB 
and 
CEIC; 
(c) 
urban 
planning 
and 
pilot 
upgrading 
component--the 
District 
Government 
of 
Hongkou; 
(d) 
Upper 
Huangpu 
Catchment 
environmental 
management 
component--Fengjing 
Water 
Purification 
Company 
Limited 
and 
Jinshan Ocean 
Outfall 
Engineering General Company 
Limited 
of 
Jinshan 
District; 
and 
Nanpai 
Sewage 
Disposal 
Company 
Limited 
of 
Fengxian 
District; 
(e) 
bond 
issue--SWAOD; 
(0 
district 
financing 
vehicle--Shanghai 
UDIC; 
and 
(g) 
institutional 
strengthening 
and 
training 
component--individual 
agencies. 
4.2 
Project 
management: 
The 
Project 
Office 
(PO), 
working 
closely 
with 
SPC, 
SCC, 
SFB, 
SEPB 
and 
SWA 
and 
other interested 
agencies 
and 
its 
Design Review 
and 
Advisory 
(DRA) 
consultants, 
arranged 
for 
and coordinated 
the 
project 
preparation 
work 
to 
the 
satisfaction 
of 
SMG 
and 
the 
Bank. 
The 
PO, whose 
staff 
has 
been 
drawn 
from 
the 
above-mentioned 
government 
agencies 
and  the 
implementing 
agencies, 
and 
which 
is 
experienced 
in 
implementing 
large-scale projects, 
would 
be 
strengthened, 
as 
necessary, 
and 
its 
personnel 
mix 
adjusted 
to  reflect 
the 
needs 
of 
the 
implementation 
and construction 
phases 
of 
the 
project. 
In 
accordance 
with 
Chinese 
practice, 
implementing 
agencies 
would 
form, budget and 
staff 
their 
own 
project 
management 
offices 
(PMOs) 
or 
sub-project 
offices, 
which 
would 
be 
involved 
throughout  project 
formulation 
and preparation. 
It 
is 
expected 
that the 
PMOs, 
with 
support 
from 
the PO, 
would 
significantly 
enhance 
project 
launch 
and 
subsequent 
implementation.

4.3 
Procurement 
issues: 
The 
Procurement 
Capacity 
Assessment 
(see 
Project 
File,  Annex 
8) 
found 
no 
concerns 
of 
substance. 
Attention 
would 
be 
given 
to 
procurement 
matters 
listed 
in 
its 
Action 
Plan 
during 
project 
supervision, 
building 
on 
the 
experience 
of 
Shanghai 
as 
an 
existing borrower 
from 
the 
World 
Bank 
Group. 
4.4 
Financial 
management 
issues: 
The 
task 
team  conducted 
a 
financial 
management 
assessment 
of 
the  adequacy 
of 
the 
financial 
management arrangements 
of 
the 
project. 
The 
information 
presented 
in 
Annex 
14 more 
fully 
describes 
the arrangements 
for 
financial 
management. 
The 
PO  would 
have 
overall 
responsibility 
for 
the 
coordination 
of 
preparation, 
training 
and 
implementation 
of 
the 
project. Implementation 
would 
be 
undertaken 
at 
the 
municipal, 
and 
district 
levels. 
The  project 
would 
use 
“The 
Temporary 
Regulations 
on 
Financial 
and 
Accounting 
Management 
for 
Projects 
Financed 
by 
the 
World 
Bank” 
issued 
by 
MOF 
during 
the 
construction 
stage 
and 
switch 
to 
“Accounting 
Standards 
for 
Industrial 
Enterprises” 
upon 
operation. 
In 
terms 
of 
disbursements,  the 
PO 
would 
produce 
project  financial 
management 
reports 
in 
line 
with 
the 
format 
and  content 
agreed 
to 
between 
the 
Bank 
and 
the 
Government 
of 
China. 
In 
addition, 
traditional 
disbursement 
techniques 
would 
be 
used 
as 
opposed 
to 
project 
management 
report 
(PMR)-based

There 
is 
no 
noncompliance 
with

for 
existing Bank-financed 
projects 
in 
the wastewater 
sector 
in 
Shanghai. 
5. 
Environmental: 
5.1 
Summarize the 
steps 
undertaken 
for 
environmental 
assessment 
and 
EMP 
preparation 
(including 
consultation 
and disclosure) and the 
significant 
issues 
and 
their 
treatment 
emerging 
from 
this 
analysis. 
The 
environmental 
assessment has 
been 
undertaken 
in 
two 
stages 
as 
follows: 
Environmental 
Category: 
A 
(Full 
Assessment) 
0 
A 
Framework 
environmental 
assessment 
(EA) 
comprising 
an 
overview 
of 
the 
key 
concepts 
of 
the 
APL, 
identifying 
potential 
environmental 
risks 
and 
providing 
a 
framework 
for 
assessment 
of 
individual 
interventions; 
Site-specific 
EAs 
for 
all 
APLl 
investments. 
0 
The 
purpose 
of 
the 
framework 
EA 
is 
to provide 
the physical, 
institutional 
and 
regulatory context 
within 
which 
the 
APL 
would 
be 
implemented. 
It 
provides 
the 
background  and  rationale 
for 
individual 
components. 
It 
also 
sets 
out 
those 
cross-jurisdictional  and 
cross-sectoral 
aspects 
of 
environmental 
management 
in 
the 
Municipality 
that 
require 
a 
comprehensive 
or 
coordinated 
management  approach 
because 
they  cannot 
be  resolved 
by 
the  actions 
of 
a 
single 
agency 
or 
an 
individual 
submunicipal 
government. 
The 
project-specific 
EAs 
have 
been prepared 
in 
accordance 
with 
national 
and 
Bank 
Group 
requirements 
and 
procedures 
and 
with 
the 
“Circular 
on 
Strengthening 
Environmental 
Impact 
Assessment 
Management 
for 
Construction 
Projects 
Financed 
by 
International 
Financial 
Organizations 
(June 
1993).” 
The 
Comprehensive 
APLl 
EA 
documents  such 
as 
the 
Environmental 
Assessment 
Report 
and 
the 
Executive 
Summary 
were 
prepared 
incorporating 
Bank 
comments. 
The 
Environmental 
Management 
Plan (EMP) 
is 
an 
integral 
part 
of 
the 
Environmental 
Assessment 
Report. 
A 
detailed 
annex 
covering 
environmental 
assessment 
and 
impact 
of 
the 
APLl 
has 
been 
prepared 
(Annex 
12), 
summarizing 
the 
findings 
of 
the 
Chinese 
EAs 
of 
the 
individual 
project 
components.

What 
are 
the 
main 
features 
of 
the 
EMP 
and 
are 
they 
adequate? 
The 
EMP 
includes 
plans 
for 
mitigation 
of 
the 
adverse 
impacts 
of 
the 
project 
components, 
the 
implementation 
of 
which would 
be 
the 
responsibility 
of 
the 
implementing 
agencies, 
principally 
SMSC, 
SWEC, 
SCAESAB, CEIC, 
and 
district 
wastewater companies. 
Overall 
monitoring 
of 
the 
impacts 
of 
the 
project 
and 
the effectiveness 
of 
mitigation 
measures 
would 
be 
the 
responsibility 
of 
SWA 
and 
SEPB.

5.4 
How 
have stakeholders been 
consulted 
at 
the 
stage 
of 
(a) 
environmental 
screening and 
(b) 
draft 
EA 
report 
on 
the 
environmental 
impacts and proposed 
environment 
management 
plan? 
Describe 
mechanisms 
of 
consultation 
that were 
used 
and 
which 
groups 
were consulted? 
A 
wide 
range 
of 
stakeholders were 
consulted 
including 
Shanghai 
government 
agencies, 
local 
government 
officials 
and 
community 
representatives. 
In 
addition, 
site-specific  consultations  were 
carried 
out 
in 
relation to 
local 
impacts 
and 
land 
acquisition. 
China 
has 
safeguard 
policies 
similar 
to 
those 
of 
the 
Bank 
Group 
and 
Shanghai, 
as 
an 
experienced 
Bank 
borrower, 
has 
a satisfactory 
track 
record 
of 
compliance 
with 
both 
sets 
of 
requirements. 
5.5 
What 
mechanisms have 
been established 
to 
monitor 
and 
evaluate 
the 
impact 
of 
the 
project 
on 
the 
environment? 
Do 
the 
indicators 
reflect 
the 
objectives and results 
of 
the 
EMP? 
SWA 
and  SEPB 
would 
be 
responsible 
for 
monitoring 
the 
overall  impact 
of 
the 
project 
on 
the 
environment 
in 
Shanghai. 
A 
set 
of 
monitoring 
indicators 
were 
prepared 
reflecting 
the 
changes 
in 
environmental 
quality 
(air 
and 
water), 
effectiveness 
and 
quality 
of 
environmental 
service 
delivery 
and 
efficiency 
of 
resource 
utilization 
(e.g. 
water 
conservation). 
6. 
Social: 
6.1 
Summarize 
key 
social 
issues 
relevant 
to 
the 
project 
objectives, and 
specify 
the 
project's social 
development 
outcomes. 
The 
adverse 
social 
impacts 
of 
the 
project 
are 
largely 
related 
to 
land 
acquisition 
and 
demolition 
of 
structures 
for 
different 
components 
of 
the 
project. 
In 
accordance 
with 
local 
laws, 
regulations 
and 
the 
World 
Bank 
OD 
4.30 
on 
Involuntary 
Resettlement, 
five 
RAPS 
have 
been  prepared 
for 
the 
project 
components 
of 
APLl. 
The 
Resettlement 
Policy 
Framework 
would 
also 
be 
applicable 
for 
future 
components. 
The 
five RAPS 
are 
based 
on 
a 
detailed 
census 
of 
the 
affected 
people, 
inventory 
of 
affected 
assets, 
socioeconomic 
surveys 
and 
extensive consultations 
with 
the project-affected 
people. 
The 
different 
components 
of 
APLl 
would 
require 
6,238 
mu 
of 
land, 
demolition 
of 
315,786 
m2 
of 
houses, 
relocation 
of 
83 
enterprises 
and 
business. 
These 
would 
affect 
7,519  people, 
including 
3,452 
in 
1,228 
household 
who 
would 
need 
to 
relocate. 
Both 
cash 
compensation 
and 
replacement 
housing 
would 
be 
offered 
to 
those 
who 
would 
lose 
their 
residences, 
as 
well 
as 
enterprises 
to 
be 
affected. 
They 
can 
choose 
either 
one 
of 
them. 
For 
the 
employees whose 
employment 
would 
be affected temporarily, 
cash 
compensation 
would 
be 
paid for 
their 
income 
losses. 
The 
RAPS 
detail 
the 
census, 
inventory, 
project 
resettlement 
policy, 
compensation 
rates 
and 
budget, 
compensation 
and 
rehabilitation 
programs, 
institutional 
and 
monitoring 
arrangements. 
The 
estimated 
base 
cost 
of 
the 
land 
acquisition and 
resettlement 
is 
Y538.5 
million, 
equivalent 
to 
$64.9 
million. 
No 
indigenous 
ethnic 
minority 
communities 
have been 
identified 
as 
living 
in 
the 
project 
areas. 
A 
two-step approach 
has 
been 
adopted 
for 
resettlement 
planning 
for 
the 
urban 
upgrading 
component 
of 
APL 
1 
and 
other 
phases 
of 
the 
proposed 
APL. 
A 
Resettlement 
Policy 
Framework 
has 
been 
prepared 
in 
- 
29 
- 
Page  34
accordance 
with 
local 
laws, 
regulations 
and 
World 
Bank 
OD 
4.30 
on Involuntary 
Resettlement. 
In 
the 
case 
of 
resettlement 
needs 
during 
preparation 
of 
APL2 
and 
APL3, 
RAPS 
would 
be 
prepared 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
policy 
framework. 
The 
World 
Bank 
has 
reviewed 
and 
found 
the 
Framework 
and 
RAPS 
satisfactory. 
6.2 
Participatory Approach: 
How 
are 
key 
stakeholders 
participating 
in 
the 
project'? 
Consultation 
would 
continue 
with 
communities 
in 
the 
areas 
directly 
affected 
by 
the 
project 
works. 
All 
affected 
households 
and 
communities 
in 
APLl 
have  been 
identified 
through 
socioeconomic 
and 
inventory 
surveys. 
Project 
information, 
including 
resettlement 
policies, 
has 
been 
provided 
to 
the 
affected 
populations  through 
different 
channels, 
including 
public 
meetings 
and 
newspapers. 
They 
were 
extensively consulted 
and 
participated 
in 
the 
finalization 
of 
the 
resettlement 
and rehabilitation 
program. 
6.3 
How 
does 
the 
project 
involve 
consultations 
or 
collaboration 
with 
NGOs or 
other 
civil 
society 
organizations? 
Local 
government 
officials 
and 
community 
organizations 
in 
the 
areas 
affected have 
been consulted 
and 
participated 
in 
the 
resettlement 
program 
finalization. 
Households 
directly 
impacted 
by 
works 
have 
been 
surveyed. 
Neighborhood 
meetings 
have  been 
organized 
to  solicit  their  views 
and 
concerns, 
as 
well 
finalizing 
the 
resettlement 
program. 
6.4 
What institutional 
arrangements have been 
provided to 
ensure 
the 
project 
achieves 
its 
social 
development outcomes? 
Internal 
and 
external 
monitoring 
would 
be 
undertaken 
continuously  throughout 
the 
implementation 
period. 
Detailed 
institutional 
arrangements 
are 
included 
in 
the 
RAP. 
6.5 
How will 
the 
project 
monitor 
performance 
in 
terms 
of 
social 
development outcomes? 
Standard 
monitoring 
requirements 
as 
set 
out 
in 
the Bank's 
procedures 
would 
be 
implemented. 
7. 
Safeguard 
Policies: 
7.2 
Describe 
provisions 
made 
by 
the 
project 
to 
ensure 
compliance 
with 
applicable 
safeguard 
policies, 
Compliance 
would 
be 
monitored 
during 
routine 
project  supervision  and 
the 
Annual 
Safeguard 
Compliance Report 
would 
provide 
full 
details 
annually.

Sustainability 
and 
Risks 
1. 
Sustainability: 
The 
project 
would 
be 
sustainable 
in 
three respects: 
(a) 
financially; 
(b) 
institutionally; 
and 
(c) 
achieving 
its 
development objectives. 
Financially, 
the 
establishment 
of 
long-term financing 
mechanisms 
would 
lead 
to 
improved 
infrastructure 
service 
delivery. 
The 
revenue 
and 
service 
charge  enhancements 
proposed 
under 
this 
project, 
together 
with 
the investments 
to 
improve 
the 
quality 
of 
water, 
the 
effective 
treatment 
and 
disposal 
of 
wastewater 
and cost-effective 
solid 
waste management, 
would 
provide 
a 
framework 
for 
urban 
service 
delivery 
sustainability. 
The  incremental 
operations  and  maintenance 
cost 
would 
be 
provided 
through 
increased 
tariffs 
and 
charges. 
Institutionally, 
the 
technical 
assistance 
to 
strengthen 
utility 
management 
will 
build 
the 
necessary 
capacity 
to 
sustain 
the 
efforts. 
Finally, 
the 
project 
addresses 
an issue 
of 
high 
priority 
to 
both 
the 
local 
and 
the 
national 
governments: 
vital 
self-interest 
in 
achieving 
environmental conditions 
necessary 
for 
sustained 
economic 
growth 
are 
a 
strong 
motivation 
to 
continue 
implementing 
the 
long-term 
water resource strategy.

Letter 
from 
the Shanghai 
Municipal 
People’s 
Government 
on 
Sending 
the Development 
Program 
for 
Shanghai 
APL 
Project 
The 
World 
Bank, 
Since  China’s 
reform 
and 
opening 
to 
the 
world 
and  under  the 
unified 
arrangement 
of 
the 
central 
government, 
Shanghai 
has 
achieved  substantial 
progress 
in 
becoming 
an 
international 
economic, 
financial, 
trade 
and 
shipping 
center. 
In 
order 
to 
further 
attract 
foreign 
and 
nonstate 
funds 
into 
Shanghai’s 
urban  infrastructure 
and 
ecological 
environment 
construction, 
and 
to 
further 
deepen 
the 
reform 
in 
investment  and 
financing 
system 
of 
infrastructure 
construction, 
the  Shanghai 
Municipal 
People’s 
Govemment 
(SMG) 
has, 
based 
on 
the 
repeated discussions 
with 
the 
World 
Bank 
on 
the 
implementation 
of 
Shanghai 
APL 
Project 
and 
with 
the 
principles 
of 
macro,  strategy 
and 
policy, 
initially 
prepared 
the 
Development 
Program 
(please 
see 
the 
appendix) 
for 
Shanghai 
APL 
Project, 
which 
is 
now 
sent 
to 
the 
World 
Bank 
for 
its 
review. 
The main 
contents 
of 
the 
Development 
Program 
are 
as 
follows: 
1. 
Overall 
Objective 
of 
the 
Project 
Development 
Program 
The 
implementation 
of 
Shanghai 
APL 
Project 
will 
help 
to 
speed 
up 
Shanghai’s 
urban infrastructure 
construction, 
improve 
its 
urban environment 
and 
enhance 
its 
comprehensive competitiveness. 
The 
overall 
objective 
of 
the 
Development 
Program 
is 
closely related 
to 
the 
Tenth Five-Year  Plan 
for 
Shanghai’s 
national 
economic 
and  social 
development. 
The 
specific  objective 
is 
to 
strengthen 
and 
enhance 
Shanghai’s 
comprehensive 
economic 
strength, 
service functions, 
development 
environment, 
innovative 
capability, 
management 
level, and 
quality 
of 
its 
people. 
The 
objective 
is 
also 
consistent 
with 
the 
Shanghai General 
Master Plan and 
the 
master 
plans 
for 
the 
environment 
sectors. 
Through implementation 
of 
the 
project, 
breakthroughs 
will 
be 
made 
in 
five 
aspects: 
water environment 
treatment, 
solid 
waste disposal, 
air 
environment 
treatment, 
comprehensive 
treatment 
of 
key 
industrial 
areas, 
and greening construction 
so 
as 
to 
further 
enhance 
Shanghai’s  comprehensive 
service functions, 
environmental quality, ecological 
environment, 
innovative capability 
and 
management 
level.

Implementation 
7. 
Project 
Organization: 
SMG 
has 
paid 
great 
attention 
to 
preparation 
and 
implementation 
of 
the 
APL 
Project. 
At 
the 
initial 
stage 
of 
the 
project 
preparation, 
SMG 
decided 
to 
adopt a three-level  operational 
structure 
to 
be 
responsible 
for 
coordination, 
management and 
supervision 
of 
the 
project. 
The 
first 
level 
is 
the steering 
committee 
responsible 
for 
the 
guidance 
and 
coordination 
of 
the 
major 
and 
important 
issues. 
Chaired 
by 
Mr. 
Qiang 
Si-xian, 
Secretary 
General 
of 
SMG, 
the steering 
committee 
has 
Mr. 
Wu 
Nian-zhu 
and 
Mr. 
Yang Xiong,  both 
are 
Vice 
Secretary  Generals 
of 
SMG, 
as 
its 
vice 
directors,  and 
has 
the 
responsible 
leaders 
of 
Planning 
Commission, 
Construction 
Commission, 
Finance Bureau 
and  other 
departments 
as 
its 
members. 
The 
second 
level 
is 
the 
working 
team. 
Headed 
by 
the 
Planning 
Commission, 
it 
has 
the 
staff 
from 
related 
departments 
of 
the 
Construction 
Commission 
and 
the 
Finance Bureau 
as 
its 
members. 
The  responsibility 
of 
the  team 
is 
to 
coordinate, 
manage 
and 
supervise  the 
daily 
work, 
to 
communicate and coordinate 
with 
the 
State 
Development 
Planning 
Commission, 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Finance 
and the 
World 
Bank. The 
third 
level 
is 
project 
offices,  i.e. 
subproject 
offices,  respectively 
set 
up 
in 
Shanghai 
Water 
Authority, 
Shanghai 
City 
Appearance 
and 
Environmental 
Sanitation 
Bureau,  and 
Shanghai 
Environment 
Protection 
Bureau,  etc. 
responsible 
for 
project 
implementation. 
The  project 
offices 
have 
regular 
staff 
working 
there 
and 
are 
also 
responsible 
for 
regularly  reporting 
the 
project 
progress 
to 
the 
working 
team. 
Supervision 
and 
Evaluation 
Plan 
for 
Project 
Implementation 
Supervision 
and 
Evaluation 
Plan: 
During 
the 
project 
implementation, 
the 
working 
team 
will 
coordinate, 
manage 
and 
supervise 
all 
activities  contained 
in 
the 
Development 
Program to 
ensure 
a 
smooth 
implementation 
to 
be 
carried 
out 
according 
to 
the 
Development 
Program, 
report 
timely 
to 
the 
steering 
committee 
the 
progress 
of 
projects 
and keep 
contact 
and 
communication 
with 
the 
World 
Bank. 
For 
example, 
it 
will 
coordinate 
and 
supervise 
the  preparation, 
design, 
investment, 
construction 
and 
progress 
program 
of 
the 
projects 
in 
all 
APL 
phases; 
evaluate 
whether 
the 
project 
agency abides 
by 
the 
relevant 
plans, terms 
of 
contracts, 
and 
other 
related regulatory 
documents. 
It 
will 
trace 
problems 
which 
may 
appear 
during 
the 
project 
implementation and 
give 
suggestions. 
It 
will 
forecast 
and 
evaluate  the 
effectiveness 
of 
solutions, 
sum 
up 
the experience 
and 
lessons 
from 
the 
previous project, and 
provide 
policies 
and 
institutional 
guarantees 
for 
the 
smooth 
implementation 
of 
later projects. 
In 
the 
last ten 
years, 
Shanghai 
and 
the 
World 
Bank 
have 
had 
a 
very 
successful 
cooperation 
in 
urban 
infrastructure and environment 
protection 
areas, 
which 
has 
deepened 
mutual 
understanding and 
trust. 
The 
implementation 
of 
Shanghai 
APL 
Project 
will 
provide 
a 
new 
opportunity 
for 
strengthening 
the 
cooperation between 
us 
in 
the 
environment 
protection 
field 
and 
for 
joint 
exploring 
reforms 
in 
the 
investment 
and 
financing 
system. 
We 
sincerely hope that the 
project 
will 
be 
carried 
out and completed 
smoothly and satisfactorily.

Detailed 
Project 
Description 
CHINA: 
Shanghai 
Urban Environment 
Project 
The 
investments 
arising out 
of 
the 
policy 
themes 
being 
pursued 
by 
the Shanghai 
Municipal 
Government 
(SMG), 
embodied 
in 
APL1, 
can 
be grouped 
under 
four 
main 
themes. 
Water 
Resources 
Protection. 
To 
support 
the 
policy 
that 
use 
of 
surface 
and 
groundwater 
resources 
should be 
balanced 
with 
their 
sustainable 
supply 
across 
all 
of 
Shanghai 
municipality, 
SMG 
would 
in 
the 
first 
phase 
of 
its 
Adaptable Program 
Loan 
(APL1) 
prepare a 
Metropolitan 
Shanghai 
Water 
Resources 
Conservation  and  Management  Strategy  comprising: 
(a) 
water 
use 
and  conservation 
policies; 
(b) 
proposed  regulations; 
(c) 
proposed  enforcement 
mechanisms; 
(d) 
monitoring 
program 
design; 
(e) 
integrated capital  investment 
plan 
for 
flood 
control, 
water 
extraction,  water 
supply 
and 
wastewater 
management; 
and 
(f) 
a 
metropolitan-wide 
institutional 
design and 
implementation 
plan. 
This 
plan would 
be 
adopted 
by 
SMG 
during 
APL1, 
with 
implementation commencing 
in 
APL2. 
To 
support 
the 
policy 
that 
water 
across 
all 
of 
Shanghai 
should  be 
available 
for 
required 
domestic, 
municipal,  industrial 
and 
agricultural 
uses 
at 
quality 
appropriate 
to 
the 
intended 
uses, 
SMG 
would 
place 
particular 
emphasis 
on 
the 
protection 
of 
municipal 
water 
supply 
sources 
in 
the 
Upper 
Huangpu 
Catchment. 
This 
would 
be 
done 
through: 
(i) 
the 
preparation 
of 
the 
Upper Huangpu 
Catchment Management 
Plan 
in 
APL1, 
defining: 
(a) 
water 
quality 
objectives and performance 
criteria (including 
designation 
of 
industrial 
zoning 
and 
land 
uses); 
(b) 
regulations; 
(c) 
penalties  and  incentives; 
(d) 
enforcement 
mechanisms; 
(e) 
monitoring 
requirements; 
(f) 
wastewater 
treatment 
capital 
investment  requirements; 
(g) 
wastewater 
treatment 
financing 
plan; 
(h) 
definition 
of 
institutional 
responsibilities; 
and 
(i) 
the 
adoption 
of 
the Management 
Plan 
by 
SMG 
and 
district 
governments. 
The 
latter 
would 
be achieved 
through 
enactment 
of 
discharge 
regulations 
and 
statutory 
land 
use 
zoning 
and 
development 
controls 
in 
all 
districts 
in 
the 
Catchment, 
enactment 
of 
penalties 
and 
incentive 
mechanisms 
to 
support 
these 
regulations, commencement 
of 
a water 
quality 
monitoring 
program 
throughout 
the 
Catchment, 
adoption 
of 
an 
Upper 
Huangpu 
Wastewater 
Treatment 
Capital 
Investment 
Plan 
with 
identified 
financing 
and 
implementation 
responsibilities, 
and 
institutional 
changes 
required 
to 
facilitate 
implementation 
of 
the 
plan. 
SMG 
would 
also  strengthen 
capacities 
of 
district 
governments 
to 
monitor 
land 
uses 
and 
wastewater 
generation, 
to 
approve 
land 
use 
changes, 
to 
enforce discharge regulations,  and 
to 
administer 
pollution 
reduction 
measures, a 
program 
of 
human 
resources 
development 
(HRD) 
in 
all 
three 
APLs, 
and 
continue 
the 
municipality’s 
nascent 
pollution 
permit trading 
system 
in 
cooperation 
with 
district 
governments. 
To 
support 
its 
policy 
that 
all 
wastewater  and 
runoff 
in 
all 
urban 
areas 
and 
all 
sludge 
generated 
from 
municipal 
treatment 
is 
collected,  treated  and  disposed 
in 
ways 
that 
protect 
public 
health, 
protect 
terrestrial 
and 
aquatic  ecosystems, 
and 
conserve 
diminishing 
land 
resources, 
SMG 
would 
prepare  an 
Integrated 
Wastewater 
and 
Sludge Management 
Plan 
for 
Metropolitan 
Shanghai 
in 
APL1. 
This 
plan 
is 
expected 
to 
become a 
model 
for 
other 
Chinese 
and 
Asian 
cities,  and 
would 
be adopted 
by 
SMG 
during 
APL1, 
and 
would 
include: 
(a) 
wastewater and 
sludge treatment 
policies; 
(b) 
enactment 
or 
refinement 
of 
regulations 
to 
support 
these 
policies; 
(c) enactment 
or 
refinement 
of 
penalties 
and 
incentive 
mechanisms 
to 
support 
the 
regulations; 
(d) 
adoption 
of 
a 
Capital 
Investment 
Plan 
with 
identified 
financing; 
and 
(e) 
institutional 
changes 
required 
to 
facilitate 
implementation 
of 
the 
plan. 
To 
ensure 
that 
municipal 
wastewater 
assets 
are 
operated 
according 
to 
best 
international 
practices, 
SMG 
would 
implement 
a 
human 
resources 
development 
program 
for 
senior executives and 
middle 
managers 
in 
the 
Shanghai 
Municipal 
Sewerage 
Company 
(SMSC) 
and the Shanghai 
Water 
and 
Environment Construction 
Company (SWEC) 
in 
all 
three 
phases 
of 
the 
APL. 
SMG 
would 
also 
implement 
a 
municipal 
executive development program 
as 
part 
of 
the 
project. 
SMG 
would 
prepare 
and adopt 
in 
APL2 
an 
explicit 
Policy 
and 
Regulations 
on 
Nonstate 
Involvement 
in 
Wastewater 
Services 
to 
improve 
the 
enabling 
environment 
for 
concession, 
build-operate-transfer 
(BOT) 
-

Page  50
and 
management 
contracts 
in 
Shanghai. 
It 
would 
also 
promote 
regional 
service 
delivery 
of 
wastewater 
services 
in 
suburban 
districts through negotiation 
and 
finalization 
of 
Interdistrict 
Service 
Agreements 
where 
regional 
service 
delivery 
is 
found 
to 
be 
cost-effective. 
SMG 
would 
also ensure 
that 
all 
wastewater 
service 
providers 
in 
suburban 
districts 
are 
fully 
corporatized 
with 
autonomous 
financial 
accounting. 
Through 
the 
pursuit 
of 
this 
policy 
SMG 
would 
have entered 
into 
an agreement 
during 
APLl 
for 
at 
least 
one 
treatment 
plant 
in 
the 
wastewater  system 
to 
be 
managed 
under 
public-private  participation 
arrangements. 
In 
addition, 
to 
support 
its 
policy 
of 
attaining 
the  State 
Environmental Protection 
Agency's  (SEPA) 
ambient 
air quality 
standards 
across 
all 
of 
Shanghai 
for 
all 
regulated 
atmospheric 
pollutants, 
SMG 
would 
prepare  an 
Air 
Quality 
Management  Study 
in 
APLl 
to 
define: 
(a) 
air  quality 
goals,  objectives, 
performance 
measures 
and 
policies; 
(b) 
key  air  quality  priorities 
and 
major 
emission 
sources; 
(c) 
emission 
reduction 
substrategies 
and 
measures; 
(d) 
jurisdictional 
roles; 
(e) 
proposed  regulations; 
(0 
proposed enforcement 
mechanisms; 
(g) 
monitoring 
requirements; 
and 
(h) 
an 
integrated 
capital 
investment 
plan 
for 
using 
natural 
gas 
for 
conversion 
of 
industrial 
boilers. 
This 
study 
would 
be 
expected 
to 
become 
a 
model 
for 
other Chinese and 
Asian 
cities 
in 
improving 
urban 
air quality. 
Solid 
Waste 
Management 
Improvements. 
To 
support 
its 
objective 
that 
solid 
waste 
from 
households, 
and the 
growing 
volume 
from 
food 
services, 
is 
collected, 
transferred, 
treated 
and 
disposed 
of 
in 
ways 
that 
protect 
public 
health and 
atmospheric, 
terrestrial 
and aquatic environments 
across 
all 
of 
Shanghai, 
SMG 
would 
pursue 
five 
principal 
targets 
during 
the 
period 
of 
the 
APL: 
(a) 
domestic and 
food 
services 
wastes 
would 
be 
managed 
in 
an 
integrated 
way 
at 
the 
metropolitan 
scale; 
(b) 
70 
percent 
of 
domestic 
solid 
waste 
in 
the 
"city 
proper" 
would 
be 
sorted 
at 
source 
by 
2005 
and 
collected 
for 
centralized 
treatment; 
(c) 
64 
percent 
of 
domestic 
and 
food 
services waste 
would be 
transferred 
in 
containers 
by 
2005; 
(d) 
the 
balance 
of 
domestic and 
food 
services waste 
would 
be 
transferred 
in 
covered trucks and 
barges 
by 
2005; 
and 
(e) 
urban and 
suburban 
domestic 
and 
food 
services waste 
would 
be 
collected,  treated 
and 
disposed 
of 
in 
controlled 
landfills or 
incinerators through 
least-cost 
solutions that meet 
environmental 
objectives. 
SMG 
would 
prepare 
and 
adopt 
in 
APLl 
a 
Solid 
Waste 
Disposal 
Development 
Plan 
for 
metropolitan 
Shanghai 
that defines: 
(i) 
collection, 
treatment 
and disposal 
objectives 
and 
quantifiable 
performance 
measures; 
(ii) 
regional 
service 
areas 
based 
on market 
demand; 
(iii) 
allowable 
technologies 
to 
be 
used 
in 
collection, 
treatment 
and  disposal; 
(iv) 
regulations 
and 
administrative 
directives; 
(v) 
penalties  and 
incentive 
measures 
to 
induce 
compliance; 
(vi) 
performance 
monitoring 
requirements 
and 
procedures; 
(vii) 
capital 
investment 
requirements; 
(viii) 
financing 
plan; and 
(ix) 
institutional 
responsibilities 
for 
all 
key 
domestic 
solid 
waste and 
food 
solid 
waste 
activities, 
including 
the clear 
allocation 
and 
codification 
of 
municipal 
and 
district 
responsibilities. 
The 
above 
policies 
and 
initiatives 
would 
be underpinned 
by 
a 
cost 
recovery 
plan. 
SMG 
has 
already  begun 
collecting 
fees 
for 
the 
collection  and 
disposal 
of 
food 
wastes. 
During 
APL1, 
SMG 
would 
develop 
and adopt 
market-oriented 
charges 
on 
users 
for 
the 
collection, 
treatment and 
disposal 
of 
municipal solid 
wastes. 
SMG 
would 
also 
strengthen 
the 
capacities 
of 
suburban 
district 
agencies 
and 
providers 
of 
solid 
waste 
management services 
in 
demand 
analysis, 
engineering 
and 
design, 
public-private 
partnerships, 
project 
management 
and 
financial 
management. 
As 
with 
wastewater  services, 
SMG 
would 
promote 
regional 
service 
delivery 
of 
municipal  solid 
waste  services 
in 
suburban 
districts  through 
negotiation 
and 
finalization 
of 
Interdistrict 
Service 
Agreements 
where 
regional 
service 
delivery 
is 
found 
to 
be 
cost-effective. 
SMG 
would 
also  ensure 
that 
all 
municipal solid 
waste 
service 
providers 
in 
urban 
and 
suburban 
districts 
introduce commercial 
accounting 
and 
management 
information 
systems, 
and 
are 
fully 
corporatized 
with 
autonomous 
financial 
accounting. 
SMG 
would 
prepare 
and 
adopt 
in 
APL2 
an 
explicit 
Policy 
and Regulations 
on 
Nonstate 
Involvement 
in 
Municipal Solid 
Waste 
Management 
Services 
to 
improve 
the 
enabling environment 
for 
concession, 
build 
operate 
and transfer 
(BOT) 
and 
management 
contracts 
in 
Shanghai.

Recognizing 
the 
growing 
problem 
across 
all 
of 
Shanghai 
Municipality 
in 
collecting,  treating 
and 
disposing 
of 
all 
categories 
of 
solid 
wastes, 
SMG 
would 
prepare 
a comprehensive 
Solid 
Waste 
Disposal 
Development 
Plan. 
This 
strategy 
and 
supporting 
regulations 
would 
be 
adopted 
by 
SMG 
in 
APL2 
as 
the 
basis 
for 
investments 
in 
this 
subsector 
in 
APL3. 
Urban 
Planning and 
Pilot 
Upgrading. 
SMG 
has 
plans 
for 
regeneration 
of 
older 
neighborhoods 
through 
upgrading infrastructure, 
revision 
of 
land 
use, 
and 
employment 
generation 
in 
the 
districts 
of 
Hongkou, 
Huangpu 
and 
Yangpu, 
which 
also 
contain 
the 
large lower-income 
industrial 
communities 
of 
the 
former 
state-owned 
enterprises. These 
areas 
are adjacent 
to 
the 
urban 
core 
of 
Shanghai 
with 
a 
population 
of 
around 
3 
million, 
and 
have 
extremely 
high 
densities, 
extreme 
overcrowding, 
poor 
housing 
without 
basic 
services, 
and 
infrastructure 
incapable 
of 
meeting current 
demands. These 
plans 
would 
be 
reviewed 
during 
APL1, 
to 
address 
key 
policies 
for 
planning 
and 
upgrading 
basic 
infrastructure 
and 
housing 
in 
Shanghai 
City: 
(a) 
providing 
basic 
services 
in 
these 
communities 
to 
standards 
that 
prevail 
in 
better-off 
areas 
in 
Shanghai 
City; 
and 
(b) 
upgrading 
services 
while 
minimizing 
resettlement and 
maximizing 
the 
retention 
of 
in-situ 
households. 
Policy 
and 
institutional 
actions 
would 
be 
clearly defined 
in 
the 
preparation 
of 
an 
urban 
planning 
and 
pilot 
upgrading 
program 
for 
Hongkou 
District 
in 
APL1, 
which 
would 
be 
adopted 
by 
SMG 
through 
statutory 
land 
use 
zoning 
and development controls, 
to 
avoid 
the 
unstructured 
development 
and loss 
of 
the 
cultural identity 
of 
the 
city. 
This 
framework 
would 
also 
include policies 
and 
regulations 
for 
the 
preservation and restoration 
of 
Shanghai’s 
heritage 
assets. 
Urban 
Environmental  Infrastructure 
Services 
Financing. 
Innovations 
in 
urban 
environmental 
infrastructure 
services 
financing 
under 
the 
APL 
would 
be 
underpinned 
by 
SMG’s 
policy 
that 
debt 
financing 
of 
capital 
investment 
in 
water,  wastewater 
and 
solid 
waste 
infrastructure 
should 
be 
financed 
principally 
from 
beneficiary 
charges, 
supplemented 
by 
borrowers’ 
general 
net 
assets 
with 
only 
limited 
and 
explicit 
commitment 
of 
municipal 
fiscal 
revenues, 
or 
direct 
or 
contingent 
government 
guarantees. 
This 
explicit 
recognition 
of 
the 
importance 
of 
project financing 
would 
be 
supported 
in 
the 
APL 
through: 
(a) 
the 
preparation 
of 
a 
policy outlining 
exceptions 
to 
full 
cost 
beneficiary 
charges, 
and 
allowable 
subsidies 
to 
poor 
households and 
distressed enterprises; 
(b) 
an 
incremental 
program 
of 
tariff 
adjustments 
to 
fully 
recover  capital, 
debt 
servicing,  depreciation, 
and operation and 
maintenance 
(O&M) 
costs 
of 
water, wastewater 
and 
solid 
waste management 
service 
delivery 
by 
the 
end 
of 
the 
APL; 
(c) 
independent 
oversight 
of 
the 
affordability 
and 
fairness 
of 
water,  wastewater 
and 
solid 
waste 
tariffs;  coordination 
of 
public 
inputs 
to 
rate-setting; 
and 
publicly 
recommend 
rate 
changes; 
and 
(d) 
preparation and 
enactment 
of 
municipal 
regulations 
that 
facilitate 
establishment 
of 
project 
revenue escrow 
accounts 
for 
debt 
servicing, 
or similar 
intercept 
mechanisms. 
SMG’s 
objective 
is 
that 
the 
debt 
portion 
of 
bulky 
capital 
investments 
in 
environmental infrastructure 
be 
financed through 
long-term borrowings 
from 
domestic 
capital 
markets that 
match 
the 
life 
span 
of 
the 
infrastructure 
asset. 
SMG 
policy 
is 
that  the 
tenure 
of 
debt 
financing 
for 
capital 
investments 
in 
water, 
wastewater 
and 
solid 
waste  management 
infrastructure 
assets 
should  match 
the 
life 
cycle 
of 
the 
infrastructure 
assets 
that 
provide 
the 
basis 
for 
project 
revenue 
streams 
from 
which 
most 
of 
the 
debt 
would 
be 
repaid. 
This 
policy would 
be 
supported 
through 
the 
structuring 
and 
issuance 
in 
the 
APL 
of 
a 
long-term 
wastewater 
infrastructure 
enterprise 
bond 
on 
domestic 
capital 
markets, 
prepared 
and credit-rated 
to 
international 
best 
practices. 
The 
bond would 
be 
explicitly 
collateralized 
with 
revenue 
streams 
flowing 
from 
beneficiary 
charges 
levied 
for 
services 
provided 
from 
capital 
investment 
in 
infrastructure 
assets 
supported 
by 
the 
bond,  and general 
net 
assets 
of 
the 
SMG-owned 
corporate  issuer 
with 
no 
or 
limited 
recourse 
to 
SMG 
guarantees. 
The 
APL 
would 
be 
used 
for 
technical 
assistance 
in 
issuing 
the 
long-term 
bond, 
and 
in 
providing 
credit 
enhancements 
to 
the 
issue. 
SMG 
would 
also  enact 
under 
the 
APL 
a 
policy 
for 
long-term  financing 
of 
capital 
investment 
in 
infrastructure 
in 
suburban  districts, 
facilitated 
by 
SMG 
support 
of 
a 
financing 
mechanism 
to 
pool 
districts’ 
credits 
and 
to 
systematically 
access 
domestic 
capital 
markets. 
This 
policy  would 
be 
-47- 
Page  52
implemented through 
the 
creation 
of 
a 
new 
financial 
intermediary--a 
district financing 
vehicle--modeled 
on 
best 
international practice 
in 
Municipal 
Development 
Funds, 
and 
financially 
supported through 
the 
APL.

Objective. 
The 
objective 
of 
the 
project 
component 
is 
to 
complete 
wastewater 
collection 
systems 
in 
the 
urban 
core, and 
treatment and disposal 
facilities 
to 
treat 
all 
wastewater generated 
in 
the 
Shanghai 
urban 
area 
(within 
the 
Outer 
Ring 
Road), 
and support  the 
first 
stage 
of 
a 
sludge management 
and disposal 
program. 
Current 
Situation. 
With 
the recent update 
of 
the 
Shanghai 
Development 
Master 
Plan, the corresponding 
water supply and 
wastewater master 
plans were 
also 
updated 
in 
December 
2001. 
Settlement 
trends 
and 
relocation 
of 
industry 
from 
the  Shanghai 
urban 
area 
have 
resulted 
in 
the 
revision 
of 
wastewater 
generation 
projections 
in 
the Shanghai 
urban 
area, 
defined 
as 
the 
area 
within 
the outer 
Ring 
Road. 
Prior 
to 
the 
early 
1990s, 
most 
wastewater 
was 
discharged untreated 
into 
the waterways,  canals 
and 
rivers 
flowing 
in 
and 
around 
the 
city; 
this 
posed considerable 
risks 
to 
public 
health and 
caused 
ongoing 
and 
noxious 
nuisance. 
Shanghai 
Municipal 
Government 
has 
however, 
partially 
with 
World 
Bank 
support, 
made  substantial 
investments 
in 
wastewater management 
over 
the 
past 
15 
to 
20 
years 
to 
intercept, 
collect, 
treat 
and 
dispose 
of 
wastewater  generated 
in 
the 
urban 
area 
of 
the 
city. The collection 
system, 
includes six 
main 
trunks 
sewers, 
comprises  1,261 
km 
of 
separate 
sewers, 
and 
1,169 
km 
of 
combined 
sewers. 
Including 
WWTPs 
completed 
and under construction, 
the 
design 
capacity 
of 
treatment plants 
discharging 
into 
the Yangtze 
River 
estuary 
and 
Hangzhou 
Bay 
amounts 
to 
4.15 
Mm3/day, 
comprising 
Shidongkou 
WWTP 
(under 
commissioning--design 
capacity 
0.4 
Mm3/day),  Zhuyuan 
I 
WWTP 
(under  advanced 
planning--design 
capacity 
1.7 
Mm3/day), Bailonggang 
WWTP 
(under construction--design 
capacity 
1.2 
Mm3/day), 
and 8 
urban 
and 
11 
suburban 
small 
WWTPs 
located 
within 
the 
city, 
with 
capacities 
varying 
from 
20,000 
m3/day 
to 
75,000 
&/day, 
totaling 
about 
0.85 
Mm3/day. 
These  plants, 
when  completed 
and 
commissioned, 
would 
have 
the 
capacity 
to 
treat about 
72 
percent 
of 
expected 
wastewater 
flows. 
Treated 
effluent 
is 
discharged 
to 
the 
Yangtze 
River 
through  outfalls, 
and 
meets the 
receiving 
water 
quality 
standard 
of 
Class 
IU.

System 
Deficiencies. 
Despite 
the impressive 
achievements 
in 
recent 
years 
in 
developing 
the Shanghai 
wastewater 
system, 
only 
about 
68 
percent 
of 
city 
wastewater 
is 
intercepted, 
and 
the 
utilization 
of 
the 
collection 
system 
and treatment 
facilities, 
is 
still 
low. 
There 
are 
missing 
links 
and 
property 
connections, 
misconnections 
(Le., 
wastewater 
connected 
to 
stormwater 
systems), 
and wastewater pipes 
discharging 
to 
rivers 
and 
canals, 
instead 
of 
to 
the 
collection 
system. 
Wastewater 
generated 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
Baoshan, 
Yangpu, 
Hongkou 
and Pudong 
do 
not 
enter the 
collection 
system. 
The 
extent 
of 
these 
deficiencies 
has 
not 
been 
fully 
assessed. 
Due to 
settlement 
trends 
and the 
relocation 
of 
industry, 
there 
is 
now 
a 
poor 
match 
between 
flows 
and 
facilities 
in 
the 
suburban 
areas, 
and  treatment 
facilities 
are 
not 
evenly 
distributed 
in 
the 
urban 
area. 
There 
is 
concern 
that 
overflows 
from 
initial 
storm 
(first 
flush) 
flows 
cause 
pollution 
in 
the 
Suzhou Creek and the 
Huangpu 
River. 
Sludge 
treatment 
and disposal 
is 
poor. 
Only 
a 
small  proportion 
of 
the 
1.3 
million 
tons 
of 
sludge  generated 
annually 
is 
currently 
disposed 
in 
an 
environmentally 
acceptable manner. 
Component Description. 
The 
component  to 
be 
financed 
under 
the 
project 
would 
comprise 
collection 
and 
trunk 
sewers 
and 
pumping 
stations, wastewater treatment 
plant 
and 
outfall, 
and 
sludge treatment. 
Collection 
System. 
The 
proposed 
collection 
system 
would 
include 
separate wastewater 
and stormwater 
collection 
systems 
in 
Baoshan 
(Area 
A), 
combined 
wastewater 
systems 
in 
Yangpu 
and 
Hongkou 
(Area 
B) 
and Pudong (Area 
C). 
The 
service 
area 
is 
about 167.7 
km2 
and 
covers 
a 
population 
of 
2.13 
million, 
with 
an 
estimated 2020 
wastewater 
flow 
of 
1.04 
Mm3/day. The 
three 
areas 
lie 
to 
the 
south 
of 
the 
Shidongkou 
system 
and 
to 
the 
north 
of 
the 
first 
stage 
of 
the 
Zhuyuan 
system, 
and 
north 
of 
the Suzhou 
Creek, 
and 
the 
area 
north 
of 
Pudong 
Zhaojiagou, 
not 
covered 
by 
the 
first 
stage 
of 
the 
Zhuyuan 
system. 
It 
is 
proposed 
to 
convey 
400,000 
m3/day 
of 
wastewater generated 
from 
Area 
A 
to 
the 
Shidongkou 
WWTP 
currently 
under 
construction, 
and the 
balance 
conveyed 
to 
the 
new 
treatment 
plant 
at 
Zhuyuan 
(Phase 
II). 
The 
collection 
system 
would 
comprise 
134.3 
km 
of 
collection 
sewers 
(design 
diameters: 
300 
to 
2,000 
mm) 
including 
eight 
pumping 
stations, 
9.5 
km 
of 
trunk 
sewers 
(design 
diameters: 
600 
to 
2,700 
mm) 
including 
one 
pumping 
station, 
and 
136.5 
km 
of 
stormwater conveyors 
(design 
diameters: 
800 
to 
3,500 
mm) 
including 
16 
pumping 
stations. 
Main 
Conveyor and Wastewater 
Treatment. 
Wastewater 
would 
be conveyed through 
a 
new 
13.5 
km 
main 
conveyor 
including 
a 
pumping 
station, 
to 
a 
new 
500,000 
m3lday 
treatment 
plant 
at 
Zhuyuan, 
incorporating 
full 
secondary treatment, 
and treated 
effluent 
discharged 
through 
existing outfalls 
to 
the 
Yangtze Estuary. 
Sludge 
Disposal. 
The 
proposed 
method 
of 
sludge 
disposal 
is 
to 
dispose 
of 
sludge at the 
Bailonggang 
sludge 
landfill. 
Proposals 
for 
co-disposal 
of 
sludge 
at 
the 
Laogang 
solid 
waste 
landfill 
would 
be 
developed 
and 
implemented 
under 
APLl.

Solid 
Waste 
Management 
services 
in 
the 
urban 
areas;

a 
market-oriented 
institutional 
arrangement 
for 
the 
provision 
of 
municipal 
solid

services;  and 
(d) 
introduce, 
on 
a 
pilot 
basis, 
a 
set 
of

economic, 
market-based 
instruments 
to 
support 
waste 
recycling.

Current 
Situation. 
Waste 
collection 
is 
done 
through mechanical 
loading 
onto 
the 
collection 
vehicles. 
Docks 
along 
the Suzhou 
creek 
and the 
Huangpu 
River 
and 
unauthorized 
dumps 
have 
been 
removed 
or 
closed, 
and 
a 
modern  collection 
and 
containerized  transfer 
and 
road 
transport  system 
has 
been 
implemented. 
The 
engineering works 
for 
the 
nightsoil 
wastewater 
entering 
into 
the 
urban 
wastewater 
treatment system 
after 
being 
discharged 
into 
the 
nightsoil 
pretreatment 
plant 
is 
in 
progress. 
The Laogang 
landfill 
was 
established 
in 
1987, and 
about 
13 
Mm3 
of 
waste 
has 
been placed 
in 
the 
fill. 
The Laogang 
landfill 
was 
upgraded and 
the 
capacity increased 
from 
3,750 
to 
about 
6,000 
tons/day. 
A 
new 
landfill 
site 
was 
established 
at 
Liming 
in 
the 
Pudong 
District 
with 
750 
tons/day 
capacity 
to 
replace 
the 
Jiangzhen 
landfill, 
located 
near 
the 
new 
Pudong 
International 
Airport. 
An 
incinerator 
with 
capacity 
of 
1,000 
to 
1,500 
tons/day 
has 
been 
constructed 
in 
the 
Pudong 
District, 
and a 
second 
incinerator 
plant 
of 
similar 
capacity 
is 
planned. 
A 
transfer station constructed 
at 
Pudong 
handles about 
1,200 
tons/day (about 
80 
percent) 
of 
the 
district 
solid 
wastes. 
Small collection 
trucks 
bring 
waste 
to 
the station,  where 
it 
is 
weighed, compressed 
(400 
to 
800 kg/m3) 
and 
loaded 
into 
12-ton 
containers, 
and transported 
25 
km 
to 
the 
Liming 
landfill. 
The district 
administrations 
are 
now 
responsible 
for 
the 
collection 
of 
municipal solid 
waste, 
while 
the 
Shanghai 
City 
Appearance 
& 
Environmental 
Sanitation 
Administration 
Bureau's 
(SCAESAB) 
responsibility 
is 
focused on 
overall 
management 
and planning, transportation 
and 
disposal. 
A 
separate 
company, 
the Shanghai 
Pu 
Cheng Heat 
& 
Power 
Energy 
Source 
Co., 
operates 
the 
Pudong incinerator 
and 
handles 
waste 
collection. 
Collection 
services 
are 
contracted 
out under 
competitive 
terms 
to 
groups 
within 
the 
Environmental 
Sanitation Bureau 
in 
Pudong and 
private 
enterprises. 
The 
terms 
of 
payment 
depend 
on 
the service 
area. 
The 
transfer 
and 
transport 
services are also 
contracted out 
by 
the 
District 
Administration 
for 
Y30 
per 
ton. 
It 
pays about 
Y25 
per 
ton 
for 
the 
disposal 
services. 
Constraints. 
The 
Laogang 
landfill 
covers 
an area 
of 
about 
3.2 
km2, 
and 
is 
adequate 
until 
end-2004. 
No 
user charges 
are 
levied 
at 
present; the system costs 
are 
financed 
from 
the 
district's 
recurrent 
budget. 
Component 
Description. 
The project 
would 
finance the 
implementation 
of 
the fourth-stage expansion 
works 
at 
the 
existing 
Laogang 
sanitary 
landfill, 
to 
increase 
the 
handling 
capacity 
to 
4,900 
tondday, 
which 
would 
extend 
the 
useful 
life of 
this 
facility 
by 
another 
18 
years 
or 
more, 
and equipment 
requirements 
for 
waste 
transport and 
dock 
rehabilitation. Specifically, 
the component 
would 
include: 
Landfill 
Improvements. 
The 
component 
would 
include 
civil 
works 
for 
landfill 
extension, 
including 
installation 
of 
facilities 
for 
leachate 
collection 
and 
treatment,

Current 
Situation. 
Adjacent 
to 
the 
center 
of 
the 
Shanghai 
city 
core 
are 
districts 
that have 
extremely 
high 
densities, 
poor 
housing and environmental 
conditions,  and 
infrastructure 
that 
has 
outlived 
its 
useful 
life. 
These 
areas 
include 
parts 
of 
Nanshi, 
Hongkou 
and Yangpu 
districts. 
Ninety 
percent 
of 
the households 
have 
no 
sanitary 
facilities, 
and 
are 
not 
connected 
to 
sewer  systems. These 
neighborhoods  have 
high 
densities, 
averaging about 
85,000 
persons 
per 
square 
hlometer, 
highest 
levels 
of 
unemployment 
and 
poverty,  very 
poor quality 
of 
urban 
environment, 
no 
open 
space, 
poor 
transport 
and urban facilities. 
These 
large 
pockets 
of 
urban 
poverty 
depress 
adjacent 
areas 
and 
pose 
unacceptable 
risks 
to 
safety  and 
health. 
Communities exist 
under 
duress, 
the 
identity 
of 
the  inhabitants 
has 
no 
expression, 
and 
these 
conditions 
increase  the 
potential 
for 
crime. 
SMG 
has 
strategic 
planning policies 
for 
regeneration 
of 
infrastructure, 
land 
use, 
and 
revitalization 
of 
these 
areas. 
The 
districts 
have 
no 
comprehensive 
development 
and 
structure 
plans, 
and 
rely 
increasingly 
upon 
the 
initiatives 
of 
private 
enterprise 
to 
carry 
out 
the 
detailed 
development, 
upgrading 
and  resettlement. 
The 
result 
is 
often 
an 
unstructured 
development 
of 
new 
high-rise 
apartments, 
as 
the 
development 
opportunities 
for 
renewal 
and 
maximization 
of 
profit 
accrue 
to 
developers. 
Planning 
authorities 
are, 
as 
yet, 
unable 
to 
adequately 
control 
design and 
construction through generally 
accepted 
policies, 
and 
do not 
have 
an 
established 
vision 
for 
the 
future. 
Component 
Description. 
The 
component 
is 
concerned 
with 
urban  planning, 
the 
upgrading 
of 
infrastructure 
services 
and 
regeneration, 
in 
the 
context 
of 
SMG’s 
strategic 
urban 
development 
policies 
within 
the 
Municipality. 
The 
project 
would 
assess 
the 
existing 
environments, 
the 
evaluation 
of 
options, 
design, 
sustainability, 
planning 
policy 
and 
related 
controls, 
as 
the 
framework 
for 
attracting 
developers 
from 
the 
public 
and 
private 
sectors. 
The  project 
seeks 
to 
assist 
in 
the 
planning, 
institutional 
and 
administrative 
frameworks 
for 
implementation, 
the 
creation 
of 
tangible 
economic, 
social 
and 
environmental benefits 
to 
the 
community, 
the 
improvement 
in 
health 
and 
safety, 
and 
strengthening 
environmental 
management. 
The project 
would 
identify 
institutional 
problems 
that 
may 
have 
arisen, 
and 
those 
that 
may 
impede 
the 
implementation 
and 
planning,  construction 
and 
management  goals 
of 
the 
district 
governments. 
Urban 
infrastructure upgrading 
would 
be continued through 
the three 
phases 
of 
the 
APL. 
Planning 
and 
upgrading 
proposals 
will 
be 
prepared 
for 
Hongkou, Yangpu and 
Huangpu 
districts, 
for 
implementation 
in 
APL2 
and 
APL3. 
Pilot 
upgrading 
would 
be 
carried 
out 
in 
Hongkou District 
in 
APL 
1. 
Support 
would 
be 
provided 
under 
APLl 
to 
infrastructure 
upgrading, and 
to 
pilot 
projects 
in 
the 
Hongkou 
District. 
It 
would 
include 
selective 
renewal 
and  upgrading 
of 
residential 
small-scale 
commercial 
environments, 
which 
would 
be 
done 
in 
a 
cost-effective 
manner and retain, 
as 
far 
as 
possible,  a 
high 
proportion 
of 
residents 
and 
traders 
in 
their traditional 
but 
improved 
environments. 
The 
Hongkou 
pilot 
would 
comprise 
three 
areas 
on 
both 
sides 
of 
Liyang 
Road 
and 
on 
Changchun 
Road, 
having 
residents 
with 
varying 
incomes, 
different 
house types, 
all 
in 
extremely 
poor 
condition, 
with 
living 
space 
generally 
less 
than 
15 
m2 
per household 
and 
basic services 
generally 
shared 
between 
multiple 
households. 
Financing 
of 
the 
Hongkou District 
pilot 
upgrading 
component 
would 
be 
subject 
to 
preparation 
of 
technical 
proposals, 
resettlement 
action 
plans 
and environmental 
assessments, 
satisfactory 
to 
the 
Bank.

US$45.70 
million 
Upper Huangpu 
River 
Catchment 
Environmental 
Management 
(Total 
Cost 
Y385.60 
million) 
Objective. 
The 
objective 
of 
this 
component 
is 
the 
improvement 
of 
environmental 
management 
of 
the 
Upper Huangpu 
River 
Catchment 
and protection 
of 
water resources. 
Current 
Situation. 
The Huangpu 
River 
holds 
strategic 
importance 
to 
the 
city 
of 
Shanghai and other 
towns 
in 
the 
upper  catchment 
because: 
(a) 
the 
upper 
reaches 
of 
the 
Huangpu 
are 
the 
primary 
water 
resources 
for 
the core 
city 
area 
and western 
suburbs, 
in 
addition 
to 
supporting agriculture 
and 
industry 
in 
the 
municipality; 
(b) 
the 
Huangpu 
River 
flows 
through 
the 
central 
business 
district 
of 
Shanghai 
which 
has 
high-value 
development 
of 
the 
riverfront 
for 
commercial, 
residential 
and 
leisure 
purposes; and (c) 
it 
is 
a 
major 
transportation 
route 
with 
large 
passenger 
and 
cargo 
terminals 
in 
the core 
city 
area. 
Pollution 
from 
domestic, 
industrial 
and 
agricultural 
waste 
in 
the 
upper catchment 
of 
the 
Huangpu 
River 
is 
one 
of 
the 
major 
sources 
of 
pollution 
in 
the 
river. 
SMG 
data shows 
that 
despite cleanup 
efforts 
by 
the 
government 
in 
recent 
years, 
water 
quality 
in 
the 
upper 
Huangpu 
River 
has 
been 
deteriorating 
each 
year. 
The Upper Huangpu 
Catchment 
Environmental 
Management component 
is 
therefore 
a 
key 
component 
in 
APL1, 
and 
subsequent 
APL2 
and 
APL3. 
The 
proposed investment 
program would: 
ensure the 
long-term 
sustainability 
of 
Shanghai’s 
water 
source 
at 
Daqiao; 
enhance 
the 
local 
environment 
in 
the upper 
reaches; 
ensure the safety 
of 
district 
and 
township 
water 
supply intakes 
for 
a 
large 
population; 
and 
provide 
strong 
support 
to 
SMG’s 
objective 
of 
raising 
the 
living 
standards 
of 
all 
residents, 
including 
in 
the suburban 
and 
rural 
areas. 
The 
component 
would 
also 
contribute 
to 
the 
APL 
objectives 
of 
innovation  through 
establishment 
of 
regional 
and 
cross-sectoral 
environmental 
management  strategies 
to 
deal 
with 
multifaceted 
pollution 
sources  and, 
in 
addition, 
address 
the 
important 
issue 
of 
municipal 
versus 
district 
and 
township 
responsibility 
(technical, 
financial, 
etc.) 
for 
environmental 
management 
and 
investments. 
Component 
Description. 
The component 
comprises 
policy 
development 
and 
physical 
investments, 
as 
follows: 
(a) 
preparation 
of 
the 
Upper 
Huangpu 
Catchment  Management 
Plan 
to 
establish 
pollution 
sources, 
and 
to 
develop 
strategies 
for 
their  control, 
comprising 
data 
collection,  modeling, 
analysis 
of 
pollution 
sources, 
policy 
development, 
and investment 
strategy; 
and 
(b) 
three  wastewater 
collection, 
treatment and disposal 
systems 
covering 
several 
towns 
within 
two 
Upper Huangpu 
Catchment 
districts 
(Jinshan 
and Fengxian), 
to 
treat domestic, 
industrial 
and 
agricultural 
wastes. 
The 
objective 
of 
the 
Catchment 
Management 
Plan 
for 
the 
Upper Huangpu 
catchment 
will 
be 
to 
provide 
the 
necessary 
planning, 
interagency 
coordination, 
regulatory 
framework, 
project 
and 
strategy 
development, 
to 
bring 
about 
the 
reduction 
of 
pollution 
in 
the 
watercourses 
of 
the 
Upper 
Huangpu 
area, 
and consequently 
an 
improvement 
in 
the water 
quality 
of 
the 
Huangpu River. 
The 
development 
of 
the 
plan 
would 
require 
significant 
mathematical 
modeling 
of 
the 
water 
quality 
and 
low 
regimes 
in 
the 
Upper 
Catchment. 
The 
Plan preparation 
will 
be 
a 
coordinated 
effort 
between relevant 
municipal 
and 
district 
level 
authorities, 
under 
the leadership 
of 
the 
Shanghai 
Water Authority. 
Xingta 
(2001 
population 
of 
about 
25,000), 
has 
2.5 
km 
of 
collectors and 
two 
secondary 
branch 
collectors, 
link 
sewers 
and 
connections, 
a 
50,000 
m3/day 
pumping 
station, 
and 
a 
pilot 
2,000 
m3/day 
treatment 
plant. 
It 
is 
planned 
to 
construct  a 
WWTP 
of 
100,000 
m3/day  capacity 
in 
two 
phases, 
along 
with 
network 
improvements. 
Fengjing 
town 
(2001  population 
of 
about 
40,000) 
has 
a 
combined 
wastewater 
and 
stormwater 
system 
in 
the 
old 
town 
area, 
constructed 
in 
the 
early 
1990s, 
which 
discharges 
directly 
to 
the 
-

- 
Page  59
urban 
rivers. 
A 
new 
separate 
wastewater 
network 
is 
planned, 
along 
with 
a treatment 
facility: 
the 
existing 
network 
system 
would 
also 
be 
upgraded. 
Nanqiao 
town, 
with 
an 
urban 
population 
(2001) 
of 
about 
400,000, 
has 
a 
22 
km 
600-1,500 
mm 
diameter conveyor that 
is 
fed 
by 
600 
mm 
diameter 
secondary 
sewers 
collecting 
wastewater 
from 
13 
smaller towns. 
The 
conveyor 
starts 
at 
the 
Huangpu 
River 
in 
the 
north 
and 
terminates 
in 
a 
1,856 
meter 
outfall 
into 
Hangzhou 
Bay. 
The spinal conveyor 
system 
was 
constructed 
between  1997 and 
1999. 
There 
are 
six 
pumping 
stations 
along 
this 
main 
spine. 
The 
town 
has 
plans 
to 
construct a 
wastewater treatment 
facility 
in 
three 
phases, 
and 
there 
will 
be 
a 
total 
of 
19 
pumping 
stations 
along 
the 
secondary 
sewers, 
which 
will 
collect 
sewage 
from 
13 
townships 
and 
deliver 
it 
to 
the 
main 
spine. 
The project 
investments 
are 
described 
below. 
Jinshan 
Sea 
Outfall  Wastewater 
Subcomponent: 
This 
project include 
a 
17.5 
km 
extension 
of 
an 
existing

mechanical and electrical 
equipment 
for two 
previously 
constructed 
pumping 
stations 
along 
the 
conveyor 
route, 
secondary 
and tertiary 
collection 
sewers 
in 
Tinglin, 
Zhuhang and 
Shanyang towns, 
connections

Provision 
has 
been made 
in 
the 
conveyor 
to 
collect 
wastewater 
from 
two 
towns 
(Yexie 
and 
Zhangze) 
in 
part 
of 
the 
Songjiang 
District, 
south 
of 
the 
Huangpu River, 
which 
would 
include 
an 
extension 
of 
the 
conveyor 
to 
the 
two 
towns. 
The 
treatment  process 
proposed 
comprises 
primary 
sedimentation 
followed 
by 
a 
modified 
A20 
system 
with 
chemical 
treatment 
of 
the 
sludge 
stream 
to 
enhance 
phosphorus 
removal. 
The project 
is 
located 
on 
the westem side 
of 
Jinshan 
district, 
and 
would 
collect 
domestic, 
industrial 
and 
agricultural 
wastewater.  Some 
major 
animal 
husbandry 
enterprises 
located 
close 
to 
the 
conveyor 
in 
Zhuhang 
town would be 
connected 
to 
the 
conveyor. 
Jinshan: 
Fengjing 
Wastewater Subcomponent: 
The 
Fengjing 
wastewater 
system 
is 
designed 
to 
collect 
domestic, 
industrial 
and 
agricultural 
wastewater 
from 
the 
two 
towns 
of 
Fengjing 
and 
Xingta, located 
in 
the secondary 
protection

m3/day 
treatment 
plant 
with 
secondary treatment, 
which 
will 
discharge 
to 
a 
tributary 
of 
the 
Huangpu River. 
The 
proposed 
oxidation 
ditch 
process 
would be 
adequate 
to 
achieve 
the 
ammonia 
discharge 
standard. 
During 
the 
detailed 
design,  measures 
to 
achieve 
the 
stringent discharge standard 
of 
0.05 
mg/l 
for 
phosphorus 
would 
be 
addressed.

Cost Effectiveness Analysis 
Summary 
CHINA: Shanghai Urban Environment Project 
Summary 
of 
benefits 
and 
costs: 
Main 
Assumptions: 
Cost-effectiveness 
indicators: 
Macroeconomic 
and 
Institutional 
Context 
This 
project 
would 
provide financial 
support and 
technical 
assistance 
to 
Shanghai 
Municipal 
Government 
(SMG) 
in 
implementing 
several 
key 
elements 
of 
Shanghai’s 
development 
program. 
The city’s 
approach 
is 
set 
out 
in 
the 
Tenth Five-Year Plan 
(TFYP) 
for 
2001-2005, 
which 
was 
approved 
by 
the 
Municipal 
People‘s Congress 
in 
February 
2001 
after a considerable 
period 
of 
extensive 
structured 
discussion 
with 
different 
groups 
in 
the 
Municipality, 
with 
the 
National 
Government 
in 
Beijing 
and 
with 
a 
wide 
range 
of 
other  parties. 
The 
TFYP 
has 
been endorsed 
by 
the 
National 
Government and provides 
the 
policy 
and 
planning framework 
for 
Shanghai 
in 
the 
medium 
term. 
Shanghai 
Municipality 
had 
a 
gross 
domestic 
product 
(GDP) 
of 
about $57 
billion 
($4,173 
per 
capita) 
in 
2000. 
Its 
industrial 
base 
continues 
to 
diversify 
with 
an 
expanding 
services sector 
and 
it 
is 
responsible 
for 
about 
5.5 
percent 
of 
national industrial 
output. 
Throughout the 
1990s, 
when 
Shanghai 
had 
strong 
political 
support 
from 
the 
central 
government,  the 
city 
underwent a 
major 
transformation,  the 
centerpiece 
of 
which 
was 
the development 
of 
the 
Pudong 
New 
Area, 
which 
rose 
from 
farmland 
on 
the 
east 
bank 
of 
the 
Huangpu River, facing 
the 
traditional 
commercial 
center 
along 
the 
Bund 
(the 
quays 
along 
the west 
bank 
of 
the 
river). 
This 
new 
business 
district, 
which 
now 
has 
a 
population 
of 
close 
to 
1 
million, 
is 
linked to 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
municipality 
by 
a 
river 
tunnel, 
two 
bridges and 
light 
rail 
and 
has 
a sophisticated 
communications infrastructure. 
It 
is 
also 
served 
by 
the 
new 
Pudong 
International 
Airport. 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
urban upgrading 
and “suburbanization” 
are 
occurring 
in 
the 
Shanghai 
City, 
the 
established 
urban 
core 
of 
Shanghai, 
with 
a 
significant 
shift 
in 
patterns 
of 
investment and 
growth, and 
a 
blurring 
of 
the 
traditional distinction 
between 
the 
urban 
core and 
the 
rural 
outer 
districts. 
The overall vision 
set 
out 
in 
the 
TFYP 
is 
of 
Shanghai 
as 
the center 
of 
a 
competitive “Global Metropolitan 
Region” 
covering 
close 
to 
200 
million 
people 
in 
the 
wider 
Yangtze 
Delta 
Region, 
including 
the 
heavily 
urbanized 
and 
industrialized corridor 
along 
the 
lower 
reaches 
of 
the Yangtze 
River. 
This 
broad 
area 
has 
a 
GDP 
estimated 
at 
around 
$300 
billion 
(in 
1995). 
The 
TFYP 
sets 
out 
five 
major 
goals 
for 
Shanghai: 
0 
0 
0 
0 
Accelerated restructuring 
to 
a 
market 
economy; 
Enhanced 
performance 
of 
all 
types 
of 
enterprises, 
with 
a 
new 
role 
for 
the 
municipal 
government 
in 
relation 
to 
enterprises; 
Accelerated 
economic development 
through integration 
of 
the 
municipality 
into 
the 
global 
economy, 
under the 
new 
World 
Trade Organization 
trade 
regime; 
Strengthening domestic and 
international 
competitiveness; and 
-61

Page  66
Improving 
the 
living 
conditions 
and 
economic 
livelihoods 
of 
Shanghai’s 
residents. 
These 
five 
goals 
are 
the basis 
for 
much 
more detailed 
development objectives  and 
related policies 
for 
Shanghai, 
and 
are 
supported 
by 
six 
sets 
of 
priority 
actions, 
covering 
economic 
diversification, 
enterprise 
reform, infrastructure 
upgrading, 
building 
human 
capital 
and 
encouraging 
innovation, and 
fundamental 
change 
to 
urban 
governance 
and 
management 
at 
both municipal 
and 
district 
levels. 
Finance 
for Infrastructure. 
SMG 
is 
looking 
to improve 
access 
to capital 
for 
its 
service 
companies 
and 
to 
bring 
increasing 
“social” 
(i.e., 
private)  investment 
into 
the 
provision 
of 
infrastructure. 
The 
APL 
will 
address 
these 
issues 
with 
the 
objective 
of 
opening 
up 
alternative 
sources 
of 
finance 
for 
ongoing 
investment. 
There 
is 
strong 
state 
government support 
for 
exploring 
these 
opportunities. 
At 
present the 
level 
of 
the 
municipality’s 
GNP 
that 
is 
invested 
in 
environment-related 
capital 
works 
is 
estimated at 
just 
under 
3 
percent over 
the past 
five 
years 
and 
this 
is 
expected 
to 
increase 
to 
3 
percent 
in 
the 
course 
of 
the 
TFYP. 
This 
is 
up 
from 
a 
reported 
2 
percent 
in 
1995. 
The 
share 
of 
environment infrastructure 
in 
the 
external 
capital 
requirements 
of 
SMG 
is 
acceptable 
at 
present 
but 
is 
being 
monitored 
by 
the 
municipal 
finance 
officials. 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
in 
order 
to help 
the 
outer 
districts 
to 
access 
a range 
of 
sources 
for 
their 
investments, 
the 
APL 
will 
help 
Shanghai 
with 
the 
definition 
and  establishment 
of 
a 
District 
Financing 
Vehicle 
that 
could 
blend 
different 
sources 
to provide 
competitive longer-term 
finance 
to 
the 
districts. 
Indicators. 
The 
environmental 
section 
of 
the 
TFYP 
sets 
out 
numerical 
targets 
for 
pollution 
control 
and 
for 
coverage 
of 
environment 
services. 
Of 
direct 
relevance 
to 
this 
APL 
are 
a target 
of 
70 
percent rate 
of 
sewage 
treatment 
and 
95 
percent 
controlled 
treatment/disposal 
of 
municipal  solid 
waste 
(with 
a 
subsidiary  target 
of 
50 
percent 
of 
this 
waste 
to 
be 
recycled). 
These 
figures 
provide 
a 
framework 
for 
setting indicators 
within 
the 
APL, 
although 
the coverage 
of 
the 
indicators 
is 
much wider 
than 
the 
basic 
scope 
of 
the 
APL. 
An 
important 
consequence 
of 
the 
internal 
Shanghai discussions 
on 
the issue 
of 
targets 
is 
an 
increasing 
stress 
in 
policies 
and 
in 
management 
actions 
on 
service 
indicators 
as 
measures 
of 
outputs. 
This 
is 
a 
significant 
attitudinal 
change 
from 
tracking 
progress 
in 
terms 
of 
investment 
inputs. 
This 
approach 
will 
be 
supported 
and 
reinforced 
in 
all 
the 
components 
of 
the 
APL. 
APL COMPONENTS 
The  overall 
APL 
covers 
a range 
of 
urban 
infrastructure  and environment 
issues 
and 
would 
support 
investments 
in 
several subsectors. 
For 
the 
proposed 
APLl 
investments, the economic 
analysis 
is 
typically 
based 
on 
cost-effectiveness. 
Urban 
Wastewater  Management. 
This 
component 
includes 
the 
third 
and 
final 
stage 
of 
backlog 
sewerage 
for 
Shanghai 
City, 
following 
Shanghai 
Sewerage 
Projects 
(SSP) 
1 
and 
2 
in 
the 
implementation 
of 
an 
1985 
sewerage strategy 
for 
Shanghai. 
The 
basis 
of 
that 
strategy, 
which 
was 
reviewed 
and endorsed 
during 
the 
preparation 
of 
SSP2, has 
been 
to 
intercept 
combined 
sewer 
outflows 
currently going 
into 
the 
creeks 
in 
Shanghai 
City 
and 
to 
take 
them 
to 
the 
Yangtze 
River 
for 
discharge. 
The 
rationale 
for 
this 
has 
been 
that 
treatment  requirements 
for 
discharge 
to 
the 
Yangtze  have 
been 
less 
stringent 
than 
for 
the 
Huangpu 
River 
in 
the 
city 
area, 
at 
least 
in 
the 
initial 
stages. 
SSPl 
and 
2 
comprised 
a 
series 
of 
interceptors 
and 
two 
major 
trunk 
sewers 
draining 
the 
central 
and  southern 
areas 
of 
the 
city to 
two 
preliminary 
treatment 
and 
outfall 
sites 
on 
the 
Yangtze 
River 
(at 
Zhuyuan 
and Bailonggang). 
Both 
of 
these 
systems are 
operating 
successfully 
and 
the 
resulting  reduction 
of 
loads 
on 
the 
city 
waterways 
has 
produced 
significant 
improvements 
to 
the 
water 
environment 
in 
the center 
of 
Shanghai 
City 
and 
especially 
along 
Suzhou 
Creek and 
the 
Bund 
area.

The 
third 
and 
final 
stage 
of 
implementation 
of 
the strategy 
(known 
as 
SSP3 
within 
APL1) 
covers the 
provision 
of 
backlog 
sewerage 
to 
the 
remaining 
northern 
areas 
of 
Shanghai 
City, 
serving 
a 
population 
of 
about 
2.4 
million 
in 
some 
of 
the 
poorest 
areas 
of 
Shanghai 
and 
collecting 
an 
average 
flow 
of 
just 
over 
1 
Mm3/d. The 
proposal 
for 
the  wastewater 
componenet 
(designated 
SSP3) 
would 
take 
the 
flows 
to 
the 
existing 
Zhuyuan 
site where 
expansion 
of 
the 
current 
preliminary 
treatment 
and 
outfall 
facilities 
would 
be 
provided before 
discharge 
to 
the Yangtze. 
Tightening 
of 
Wastewater Discharge Standards. 
China 
has 
a comprehensive system 
of 
water 
quality 
and 
wastewater  discharge  standards, 
which 
are 
consistent 
with 
good 
international 
practice. 
There 
has 
been 
flexibility 
in 
the past 
in 
the 
interpretation 
and 
application 
of 
these 
standards 
but 
rising 
concerns 
over 
the 
serious 
levels 
of 
water 
pollution 
in 
many 
parts 
of 
China 
have 
led 
to 
an increasing 
stringency 
in 
the 
application 
of 
these 
standards. 
Of 
particular 
relevance 
to 
the design 
of 
SSP3 
is 
the insistence 
by 
the 
national 
authorities 
that  the 
whole 
Yangtze 
River, 
including 
the 
estuary 
area 
be 
considered a 
Class 
II 
water body, 
requiring 
secondary 
treatment 
for 
any 
new 
wastewater discharges. 
The existing 
SSPl 
and 
SSP2 
systems 
are 
designed 
with 
enhanced 
primary 
treatment 
(intended 
to 
reduce 
the solids 
load 
and 
also 
to 
remove 
phosphorus, 
which 
is 
the 
critical 
nutrient 
for 
the estuary 
area). 
This 
is 
adequate 
to 
meet 
the 
local 
water 
quality 
requirements  and  considerably 
cheaper 
than 
secondary 
treatment. 
Monitoring 
has 
shown 
that the 
existing 
systems are 
operating 
as 
predicted 
and 
that 
the 
local 
impacts 
systems 
are less 
significant 
than 
forecast 
at 
the 
design 
stage. 
Under 
the 
new 
requirements, 
the 
higher levels 
of 
treatment 
will 
provide 
some 
additional 
reduction 
in 
pollution 
loads 
but 
at 
significantly 
high 
costs, 
which 
changes 
the 
economics 
of 
the 
options 
for 
SSP3. 
Wastewater 
Master 
Plan. 
A 
new 
Wastewater 
Master  Plan 
has 
been  prepared 
for 
the 
whole 
Municipality, 
in 
line 
with 
overall 
development 
planning 
under 
the 
TFYP 
for 
the 
period 
2000-2005. 
This 
Wastewater 
Master Plan 
has 
been 
approved 
by 
the 
Shanghai 
Municipal 
Government and 
sets 
out 
the 
broad 
parameters 
for 
planning 
and investment 
in 
water 
pollution control 
over 
the 
coming 
five 
years 
and 
beyond. 
The 
basic aims 
of 
the 
Wastewater 
Master Plan 
are 
to 
address 
not 
just 
domestic 
and 
industrial 
wastewater 
but 
also 
intensive animal 
raising 
(a 
key problem 
in 
the 
Upper 
Huangpu 
Catchment), 
and 
to 
deal 
with 
these 
in 
a 
mixture 
of 
“centralized” 
and “local” 
systems. 
(“Centralized’ 
treatment 
systems 
are 
those based 
on 
major 
interceptors and 
large 
treatment 
plants.)  Issues 
of 
particular 
concern 
in 
the development 
of 
the 
Master 
Plan 
are 
the 
low 
utilization 
of 
the 
existing 
facilities; 
a 
mismatch 
in 
the 
location 
of 
facilities 
(as 
population 
and 
industry 
moves 
from 
the 
overcrowded 
city 
center 
to 
the 
suburbs); 
the 
large 
areas 
still 
served 
by 
combined 
sewers, 
resulting 
in 
storm 
overflows 
to 
the waterways; 
and the need 
to 
deal 
better 
with 
the 
question 
of 
sludge. 
The 
key 
principles 
of 
the 
Master Plan 
are 
expressed 
as: 
“Three 
increases, 
Two 
strengthenings, 
and 
One 
utilization.” 
These 
are 
as 
follows.  The 
first 
principle 
is 
to 
increase the 
capture 
of 
wastewater 
flows 
and 
storm overflows 
into 
the sewer 
systems; 
to 
increase the 
utilization 
of 
the 
existing 
infrastructure; 
and 
to 
increase 
the 
percentage 
of 
flows 
that 
are 
treated 
before 
discharge. 
The 
strengthenings  relate 
to 
wastewater treatment 
for 
Shanghai 
City 
and 
to 
protection 
of 
the 
Upper 
Huangpu. 
The 
“one 
utilization” 
refers 
to 
careful 
and suitable 
use 
of 
the water 
resources 
of 
the 
municipality 
for 
the 
benefit 
of 
the 
people 
of 
Shanghai. These 
principles 
provide 
a 
very 
sound 
basis 
for 
the 
future direction 
of 
the 
sector 
and 
are 
consistent 
with 
Bank 
objectives 
of 
focusing 
on 
results and ensuring 
cost 
effectiveness. 
In 
line 
with 
the 
Master 
Plan 
directions, 
the 
Municipality 
expects 
to 
invest 
about 
Y18 
billion 
in 
wastewater 
systems 
over 
the 
TFYP, 
representing 
investment levels 
of 
about 
$430 
million 
per 
year, across 
the 
whole 
area 
of 
the

Municipality 
. 
Existing 
Systems. 
In 
moving 
to 
the 
implementation 
of 
these 
approaches, the 
Master 
Plan 
considers 
six 
major 
catchments 
for 
the 
Municipality, 
three 
of 
which 
include 
Shanghai 
City 
and 
some 
adjoining 
areas 
and 
the 
other 
three 
of 
which 
relate 
to 
the 
ruralhburban 
areas 
(and the islands 
in 
the 
Yangtze 
estuary). 
The 
remaining 
undrained 
catchments 
in 
Shanghai 
City 
(taken 
as 
the 
area 
inside 
the 
Ring 
Road) 
include 
some 
areas 
to 
the northeast 
that 
are 
not 
served 
and a number 
of 
older 
and 
poorer 
dense 
areas 
north 
of 
Suzhou 
Creek. 
There 
is 
also 
a 
small 
area 
between the 
city 
and the 
existing 
Zhuyuan 
plant 
which 
will 
be 
included 
in 
SSP3. 
The 
two city 
areas 
together 
cover 
about 
150 
km2 
and 
would 
serve 
a 
population 
estimated 
at 
2.3 
million 
in 
2002 
(based 
on 
a 
decrease 
from 
existing population 
as 
redevelopment 
occurs 
and housing conditions 
are 
improved 
(especially 
in 
that 
area 
which 
includes 
parts 
of 
the 
Hongkou 
and 
Yangpu Districts, 
which 
are 
the 
most 
dense 
and poorest 
parts 
of 
Shanghai 
City). 
Approach 
to 
Serving 
SSP3 
Areas. 
Detailed 
estimates 
have been made 
of 
the 
design 
flows 
from 
these 
areas 
and 
these 
estimates 
total 
about 
1.6 
Mm3/d 
for 
the 
design 
year 
of 
2020. 
Analysis carried 
out 
during 
project 
preparation 
compared 
two 
broad 
options 
for 
the treatment 
and disposal 
of 
these 
remaining 
loads. 
One 
is 
based 
on 
the 
original 
strategy 
of 
transport 
to 
the 
Yangtze 
and 
discharge  after  appropriate 
treatment, 
as 
has 
been 
implemented 
under 
SSPl 
and 
SSP2. 
The 
most 
logical 
and 
favorable 
location 
for 
this 
discharge 
is 
adjacent 
to 
the 
existing 
Zhuyuan 
outfall 
site 
(as 
had 
been 
originally 
envisaged) 
and 
this 
option 
is 
known 
as 
Zhuyuan 
II. 
The 
alternative  approach 
is 
based 
on 
sharing 
the 
loads 
between 
the 
remaining 
capacity 
in 
the 
Zhuyuan 
(SSP1) 
system 
and 
local 
treatment 
in 
the catchment 
at 
Minxing 
with 
discharge 
to 
the 
Huangpu. 
The 
Zhuyuan 
11 
system 
has 
a 
number 
of 
advantages 
on 
environmental 
grounds, 
in 
particular 
the 
elimination 
of 
the discharge 
of 
treated 
effluent 
to 
the 
Huangpu 
(and 
the  associated 
risk 
of 
overflow, 
malfunctions, 
etc.) 
and 
the 
location 
of 
the 
treatment 
plant 
in 
an 
area 
with 
significant industrial 
activity, 
away 
from 
the 
inner  city.  The 
selection 
of 
the 
Minxing 
site 
was  also 
reviewed, 
to 
see 
if 
a 
viable 
lower-cost 
site 
could 
be 
found. 
However, 
the 
site 
is 
already 
at 
the 
northem 
edge 
of 
the 
service 
area. 
Other possibilities 
were 
eliminated 
by 
planning 
constraints 
(areas 
designated 
for 
urban 
redevelopment) 
or 
by 
the 
inability 
to 
buy 
land 
from 
major 
industrial 
enterprises 
along 
the 
river. 
Least-cost 
analysis  was 
carried 
out 
by 
the 
design 
team, 
with 
the  design 
review 
and advisory 
(DRA) 
consultants, 
comparing 
both 
the 
capital 
and 
net 
present 
value 
(NPV) 
costs 
of 
the 
two 
options. 
The 
results 
showed 
that 
the 
options 
were close 
to 
each 
other 
but 
that 
the 
Zhuyuan 
II 
option had both lower 
capital 
costs 
[Y1.57 
billion 
($198 
million) 
against 
Y1.86 
billion 
($223 
million)] 
and 
a 
lower 
NPV 
(Y2.27 
billion 
($273 
million) 
versus Y2,795 
billion 
($337 
million). 
These estimates 
include 
costs 
of 
land, resettlement, 
and 
all 
construction 
costs. 
Foreign 
exchange 
requirements 
for 
both 
options 
are 
very 
similar 
and 
of 
the 
order 
of 
10-14 
percent 
of 
the 
costs 
of 
treatment. 
The 
most 
important 
cost 
components 
are 
civil 
works 
which 
account 
for 
40 
percent 
of 
total 
base 
costs 
and 
resettlement 
which 
accounts 
for 
about 
32 
percent 
of 
the total. 
A 
review 
of 
the 
details 
of 
the 
costs 
showed 
that 
the costs 
of 
the 
pumping 
stations 
and 
conveyors 
to 
Zhuyuan, 
which 
cross the 
increasingly 
built-up 
Pudong 
area are 
more 
than 
balanced 
by 
the 
higher 
land 
costs 
and 
treatment systems costs associated 
with 
the 
confined 
Minxing 
site. 
Marginal 
Costs. 
The 
average 
incremental 
cost 
(AIC) 
values 
were 
calculated 
for 
these 
options 
and 
are 
in 
the 
range 
of 
from 
Y2.3 
to 
2.6 
($0.28 
to 
0.31) 
per 
m3 
and 
are 
similar 
in 
both 
financial 
and 
economic 
terms. 
Property 
Connection 
Costs. 
The 
costs 
of 
connecting 
properties 
to 
the 
new 
sewerage 
system need 
to 
be 
included 
in 
the 
economic 
assessment. 
Broad 
cost estimates 
were prepared 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
number 
of 
- 
64 
- 
Page  69
households 
and 
other  properties 
to 
be 
connected, 
and 
unit 
connection 
costs 
provided 
by 
SMSC. 
The 
resulting 
estimates 
indicate 
total 
property  connection 
costs 
of 
about 
Y800 
million 
($96 
million), 
including 
the 
additional 
costs 
for 
nonresidential 
properties 
in 
both 
areas. 
For 
the 
purposes 
of 
analysis, 
it 
has 
been 
assumed 
that the 
costs 
will 
be incurred over 
a four-year 
period 
from 
2007 
to 
2010. 
Benefits 
of 
the 
Wastewater 
Component 
In 
the 
late 
1980s, 
SMG 
embarked 
on 
a 
major 
investment 
program to 
develop 
the 
City’s 
wastewater 
network 
and 
sewage 
treatment 
facilities. 
Considerable 
progress 
has 
been made 
over the last 
10 
years 
with 
the 
active 
support 
of 
the 
World 
Bank. 
In 
this 
context, 
the 
Wastewater Component 
of 
SHUEP 
represents 
a 
logical 
extension 
of 
those 
works 
and 
will 
generate 
a 
wide 
range 
of 
environmental 
and 
public 
health 
benefits. 
To 
help 
to 
understand 
these, 
a Socioeconomic Survey 
of 
600 
households 
and 
225 
industrial 
and 
commercial 
enterprises 
was 
commissioned 
from 
the  Shanghai 
Municipal 
Statistics 
Bureau 
(SMSB). 
Detailed information 
was 
sought 
also 
from 
relevant 
municipal 
agencies 
for 
a range 
of 
direct 
benefit 
areas 
such 
as: 
public 
health; 
potential 
cost savings 
in 
septic 
tank and 
nightsoil 
operations; 
flooding 
impacts; 
and 
land 
and 
property 
value impacts. 
Property 
Rental 
Values. 
Data 
collected 
by 
the  Shanghai 
Environmental 
Protection 
Bureau 
(EPB) 
demonstrate 
that the water 
quality 
in 
the 
Huangpu 
has 
improved significantly 
from 
the “days 
of 
the 
Black 
and 
Stink” 
which 
prompted 
SMG 
to 
undertake 
the 
sewerage 
program. 
Analysis 
done 
at 
the 
time 
of 
the 
initial 
Sewerage 
Strategy 
identified 
a 
number 
of 
potential 
benefits 
of 
the program, 
including 
increased 
property 
values 
along 
the 
major 
waterways. 
It 
has 
turned 
out 
that Suzhou Creek 
in 
the center 
of 
the 
city, 
which 
was 
formerly 
the 
most 
polluted 
tributary 
of 
the 
Huangpu, 
has 
become 
an 
axis 
for 
high-value 
property 
development, desirable 
for 
both 
commercial 
and 
residential 
purposes. 
Over 
the 
same 
period, the 
promenade  beside  the 
Huangpu 
River 
along 
the 
Bund, 
which 
was 
always  a 
popular  location, 
has 
undergone 
major 
redevelopment 
and 
is 
now 
a 
major 
attraction 
for 
domestic and 
foreign 
tourists, 
as 
well 
as 
locals. 
It 
is 
not 
possible 
to 
attribute 
a 
specific 
portion 
of 
the 
significant 
increase 
in 
economic value 
of 
the 
river 
precincts 
to 
the water 
quality 
improvements 
but 
clearly 
the 
sewerage 
program 
is 
bringing 
major 
economic benefits. 
The 
provision 
of 
improved 
sewerage 
and stormwater drainage 
facilities 
will 
enhance 
property 
values 
in 
the 
project 
area. 
The 
results 
of 
the 
socioeconomic survey 
demonstrate the 
high 
to 
medium 
priority 
which 
respondents 
attach 
to 
improvements 
in 
their 
living 
environment, 
key 
urban 
services 
and 
measures 
that 
will 
enhance the status 
of 
Shanghai. Therefore, 
it 
is 
expected that the 
new 
wastewater 
and stormwater 
facilities 
will 
generate 
increased 
property 
values 
throughout 
the 
project 
area. 
This 
was 
confirmed 
in 
discussions 
with 
the 
Shanghai 
Municipal 
Housing, 
Land 
and 
Resources 
Administration 
Bureau, and 
local 
property 
consultants. 
An 
estimate 
was 
made 
of 
the  size 
of 
the 
benefits 
associated 
with 
rental 
value 
increases. 
The 
property market 
in 
Shanghai 
is 
still 
in 
the 
early 
stages 
of 
development, 
and most 
property 
is 
owned 
and 
controlled 
by 
the 
state. 
Therefore, 
residential household 
rents were 
used 
as 
a 
proxy 
for 
enhanced 
property 
values, 
although 
rents 
are 
acknowledged 
to 
be below 
realistic 
market levels 
in 
Shanghai. 
Based 
on 
the 
results 
of 
the 
socioeconomic 
survey, the average 
household 
rent 
in 
the 
project 
area 
is 
Y66.7 
($8) 
per 
month 
and 
amounts 
to 
3.1 percent 
of 
average 
household 
income 
in 
2002. 
Properties close 
to 
creeks, 
canals, 
tributaries 
and 
the 
main 
watercourses 
(Suzhou 
Creek  and 
Huangpu River) 
will 
be 
the 
main 
beneficiaries 
in 
terms 
of 
enhanced 
environmental benefits 
(e.g. 
eliminated 
and 
reduced 
smells, 
periodic 
flooding 
from 
storm 
events, 
etc.). 
There 
is 
not sufficient 
data 
to 
make 
confident 
estimates 
of 
the 
increases 
in 
property 
values  associated 
with 
the 
environmental improvements 
but 
reasonable estimates 
indicate 
incremental 
residential 
rents 
in 
the 
areas 
close 
to 
the waterways 
are 
projected 
to 
rise 
from 
Y315.2 
million 
- 
65 
- 
Page  70
($38 
million) 
in 
2007 
to 
Y683.5 
million 
($82.3 
million) 
by 
2020. 
Potential property benefits attributable 
to 
commercial 
and 
industrial 
enterprises 
in 
the 
project 
area 
have 
not 
been 
estimated 
because 
of 
the 
lack 
of 
an 
adequate 
database. 
Other 
Benefits. 
Other 
benefits 
that 
have 
not 
been 
quantified 
include: 
Public 
health. 
The 
project should lead 
to further 
improvements 
in 
public 
health. 
According to 
the 
socioeconomic  survey 
(January 2002), 
waterborne and water-related 
diseases 
are 
more 
prevalent 
in 
the 
project 
area 
north 
of 
Suzhou Creek than 
in 
the  southern 
districts 
of 
the 
city. Ten 
percent 
of 
respondents 
north 
of 
Suzhou 
Creek 
reported 
water-related 
illnesses, 
compared 
with 
5.5 
percent 
in 
the 
southern 
districts. 
This 
observation 
is 
also 
supported 
by 
information 
presented 
in 
the Suzhou Creek 
Rehabilitation 
Project 
Report 
which 
states 
that 
viral 
hepatitis and 
dysentery 
are 
the 
two 
leading 
water 
pollution-related 
diseases 
and 
that 
in 
the 
Suzhou 
Creek project 
area, 
the 
combined annual 
morbidity 
rate 
for 
the 
two 
diseases 
was 
nearly 
10 
percent 
higher 
than 
for 
urban 
Shanghai. 
The 
wastewater 
and 
stormwater 
project 
will 
reduce 
some 
of 
the 
physical 
vectors 
which 
convey 
waterborne 
and 
water-related 
diseases (e.g. 
septic tanks, 
nightsoil 
facilities, 
other basic 
sanitation facilities, 
vermin 
and 
rodents, 
unsanitary 
canals 
and 
waterways, 
etc.), 
but 
parallel initiatives 
will 
be 
needed 
in 
public 
health 
education and improvements 
in 
personal hygiene. 
Septic 
tanks 
and 
nightsoil 
disposal. 
The project 
would help 
to 
achieve 
significant 
cost  savings 
through 
the 
replacement 
of 
septic  tanks 
and 
nightsoil 
facilities 
which 
are 
still 
prominent 
forms 
of 
sanitation 
in 
large 
areas 
of 
Putuo, 
Zhabei and 
Hongkou 
Districts. 
There 
would 
also 
be 
significant 
amenity 
improvements. 
Public 
health 
protection 
and improved 
urban 
services. 
The 
safe 
collection, 
treatment and disposal 
of 
urban 
wastewater, 
the 
similar 
improvement 
in 
nightsoil 
disposal, 
and the 
proposed improvements 
in 
the 
municipal solid 
waste 
system 
in 
the 
Municipality 
(see 
subsequently)  represent an 
important 
and 
cost-effective 
strategy 
for 
public 
health protection. 
Shanghai 
will 
reap the 
indirect 
non-quantifiable 
but 
not 
insignificant 
benefits 
of 
these 
city 
management 
decisions 
in 
the 
years 
to 
come, 
reducing 
the 
risks 
of 
diseases 
and 
epidemics, 
and sustaining economic 
growth 
and 
urban 
livability. 
Flooding 
and overflows. 
The 
proposed stormwater conveyors 
to 
be 
constructed 
in 
the 
northern 
area 
would 
alleviate 
the 
impact 
of 
frequent 
flood 
events 
during 
the 
rainy 
season, 
and 
eliminate 
unsanitary 
overflows 
from 
septic tanks 
and other 
sanitation 
facilities. 
It 
is 
reported 
that 
80 
percent 
of 
this 
area 
(117 
km2) 
is 
prone 
to 
periodic 
flooding 
to 
depths 
of 
about 
30 
cm, 
which 
implies 
that about 
1.1 
to 
1.2 
million 
people 
are 
at 
risk, 
of 
whom 
approximately 
120,000 
(1 
1 
percent) 
are 
poor 
(income 
of 
below 
$1 
per 
day). 
Flooding 
also 
disrupts 
normal 
commercial 
and 
industrial 
activities 
in 
the 
area, 
which 
has 
an adverse 
effect 
on 
the 
local 
economy. 
Environmental 
impacts. 
One 
of 
the 
central objectives 
is 
the 
rehabilitation 
and 
cleanup 
of 
the 
city’s 
main 
waterways 
(Suzhou 
Creek 
and 
Huangpu River) 
and 
minor 
tributaries. 
In 
the  socioeconomic 
survey, 
between 
81 
and 98 percent 
of 
respondents 
in 
the 
project 
area 
highlighted 
the 
importance 
of 
the environment 
in 
justifying 
further 
investment 
in 
the 
municipal 
sewerage 
and 
wastewater treatment 
system. 
Tourism. 
The 
socioeconomic  survey 
also 
showed 
that 
70 
percent 
of 
respondents 
to 
the 
household 
questionnaire 
in 
the 
project 
area 
believe 
that 
further 
improvements  and  extensions 
of 
the 
city’s 
sewerage 
and 
sewage 
treatment 
network 
would 
have a 
beneficial impact 
on tourism 
to 
Shanghai. 
The 
tourism 
sector accounts 
for 
5 
percent 
of 
GDP. 
In 
2000, 
Shanghai 
received 
64.3 
million 
domestic 
-

Page  71
visitors 
and 
1.8 
million 
foreign visitors 
spending 
an 
estimated Y93.6 
billion 
($11.3 
billion). 
Ability 
to 
Pay 
The 
City 
and 
the adjacent 
districts 
form 
a 
major 
growth 
region 
for 
the Chinese 
economy, 
with 
GDP 
growing 
at 
an 
average 
of 
11 
to 
13 
percent 
per 
year 
for 
the 
last 
decade, 
and expected 
to 
grow 
at 
9 
to 
10 
percent 
per 
year 
over 
the 
TFYP 
period 
(2001-2005). 
Average 
GDP 
per capita 
reached 
about Y34,640 
($4,173) 
in 
2000 
(the 
highest 
in 
China) 
and 
is 
expected 
to 
reach 
Y54,OOO 
($6,605) 
in 
2005. 
Overall, 
these 
developments 
will 
generate 
a 
higher 
level 
of 
real 
income 
and 
increased 
ability 
to 
pay 
for 
environmental 
improvements, 
pollution 
reduction 
and urban 
services such 
as 
sewerage 
and 
stormwater 
drainage. 
Based 
on 
the 
results 
of 
the 
Socioeconomic 
Survey, estimates have 
been 
made 
of 
the 
incremental 
ability 
to 
pay 
for 
improved 
sewerage services 
in 
the 
Project 
Area. 
In 
2002, 
domestic households 
in 
the 
project 
area 
had 
an average 
income 
of 
Y2,140 
($258) 
per 
month, 
of 
which 
an 
average 
of 
Y1l.l 
per 
month 
($1.3) 
or 
0.5 
percent 
was 
spent 
on 
sewerage services. 
Average household water 
consumption 
was about 
17.8 
m3 
per 
month 
(189 
litersheadday). The 
resulting 
average sewerage 
charge 
was 
Y0.62 
($0.075) 
per m3 
of 
water  consumed 
(SMSC 
charges 
for 
sewerage 
services 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
water  consumption). 
This 
proportion 
of 
household income 
spent 
on 
sewerage  services 
(0.5 
percent) 
is 
low 
by 
intemational 
standards. These 
results 
clearly indicate 
that domestic 
households 
and 
commercialhndustrial 
enterprises 
are 
able 
to 
pay a 
higher proportion 
of 
their 
income 
to 
support 
an 
efficient 
and 
effective 
sewerage service, 
both 
now 
and 
in 
the 
future. 
Poverty and 
Distributional 
Aspects 
Poverty 
alleviation 
is 
an 
important 
issue 
for 
both 
SMG 
and 
the 
World 
Bank. The 
aim for 
this 
project 
is 
to 
ensure 
that 
low-income 
and 
other 
disadvantaged groups 
within 
the 
municipal 
area 
participate 
fully 
in 
the 
environmental  benefits 
and 
improved 
urban 
services 
which 
would 
accrue 
from 
the 
successful 
implementation 
and 
operation 
of 
the 
wastewater  management 
components 
of 
the 
APLl 
investment 
package. 
Official 
statistics 
for 
Shanghai 
indicate 
that 
poverty 
is 
not 
a 
significant 
problem 
in 
the 
city 
overall 
with 
less 
than 
1 
percent 
of 
the 
urban 
population 
below 
the 
World 
Bank’s 
poverty guideline 
of 
$1 
per 
day 
[equivalent 
to 
Y750 
($90) 
per 
month 
for 
a 
household 
of 
three persons]. 
However, 
the results 
of 
the 
socioeconomic  survey 
indicate 
that 
more 
than 
14 
percent 
of 
the 
population 
in 
the 
districts 
north 
of 
Suzhou Creek 
is 
below 
this 
level. 
The 
survey 
results 
indicate 
average 
monthly 
household 
income 
of 
Y2,140 
in 
the 
districts 
north 
of 
Suzhou 
Creek, 
with 
only 
small 
variations 
ranging 
from 
Y2,020 
per 
month 
in 
Putuo 
District 
to 
Y2,385 
per 
month 
in 
Yangpu 
District. 
Based 
on 
the 
results 
of 
the socioeconomic 
survey, 
it 
is 
estimated that 
340,000 
people 
in 
about 
113,000 
poor 
households (14.1 
percent 
of 
the 
target 
population 
of 
2.4 
million) would 
benefit 
from 
the proposed 
investment 
in 
new 
and 
improved 
sewerage 
systems, 
wastewater 
treatment 
facilities, 
stormwater 
drainage, 
and 
the 
resulting 
environmental improvements.

Urban 
Solid 
Waste 
Management 
Context. 
The 
total 
amount 
of 
all 
types 
of 
solid 
waste generated 
in 
Shanghai 
is 
about 
89,000 
t/d 
of 
which 
domestic 
solid 
waste 
comprises 
about 
12,500 
t/d. 
This 
represents an average 
of 
about 
0.84 
kg/t/d 
which 
is 
typical 
for 
a 
large 
city 
at 
this 
stage 
of 
development. 
About 
6,000 
t/d 
of 
the 
domestic 
waste 
from 
the 
urban 
area 
(63 
percent 
of 
the 
total 
generated) 
goes 
to controlled 
landfills 
at 
Laogang 
(which 
takes 
about 
4,900 
t/d) 
and at 
Li 
Ming. 
The 
remainder 
of 
the 
urban 
domestic 
waste 
and 
most 
of 
the 
rural 
domestic 
waste 
goes 
to 
open 
dumps, 
of 
which 
219 
have been 
identified. 
There 
are 
two 
municipal solid 
waste 
incinerators 
in 
Shanghai 
Municipality, 
one 
recently completed 
in 
Pudong  and  a 
second 
under 
construction.  There 
are 
also 
a 
number 
of 
small 
composting 
and  other 
“treatment” 
plants. 
In 
the 
urban 
area, 
collection 
and transportation 
of 
domestic 
waste 
is 
the 
responsibility 
of 
the 
Districts. 
The 
Shanghai 
Municipal 
Government (SMG) 
takes 
responsibility 
from 
the  transfer 
stations 
onward. 
Outside 
this 
urban 
area, 
the 
Districts 
are 
fully 
responsible 
for 
managing 
the 
wastes. 
In 
Shanghai, 
as 
in 
all 
other 
large 
cities, 
space 
for 
landfill 
is 
very 
difficult to 
find 
and there 
is 
no 
realistic 
alternative 
for 
the 
city 
apart 
from 
expansion 
of 
the 
existing 
facility  on  land 
already 
allocated 
for 
this 
purpose. 
Songjiang 
District, 
one 
of 
the 
more 
wealthy 
of 
the 
suburban 
areas, 
has 
recently 
established a 
new 
sanitary 
landfill 
for 
its 
own 
use 
but--as 
in 
other 
environmental 
services-there 
is 
a 
lack 
in 
regional 
coordination 
and 
planning 
and 
the 
Songjiang 
site 
is 
not 
intended 
for 
the 
use 
of 
the 
whole 
metropolitan 
area. 
Food 
waste. 
SMG 
has 
recently banned 
the 
traditional 
practice 
of 
farmers 
taking 
food 
waste 
from 
the 
urban 
restaurants 
and 
markets, 
to 
feed 
their 
pigs. 
This 
action, 
which 
was 
taken 
to 
protect agriculture 
from 
the 
risk 
of 
animal 
diseases 
being 
transmitted, 
has 
resulted 
in 
the 
need 
for 
the 
waste 
authorities 
to 
handle 
approximately 
1,100 
t/d 
of 
food 
waste. 
The 
high 
water 
content 
of 
this 
waste 
is 
causing 
problems 
in 
both 
transportation and 
landfilling. 
Other 
solid 
wastes. 
In 
addition 
to 
the 
domestic 
waste 
and 
the 
food 
waste, 
there 
are 
several 
other 
waste 
- 
68 
- 
Page  73
streams 
which 
are 
not 
included 
in 
this 
component 
but 
which 
may be 
addressed 
in 
APL2. 
These 
include 
large quantities 
of 
construction 
and 
industrial 
solid 
waste 
(much 
of 
which 
is 
recycled 
in 
one 
way 
or 
another) 
and 
hazardous 
waste, 
which 
is 
a 
small quantity 
but 
a 
very 
important 
part 
of 
the 
overall 
waste 
stream. 
A 
separate 
project 
is 
being 
developed 
to 
consolidate 
the management 
of 
medical 
wastes 
into 
a 
coherent 
system, based 
on 
good 
management 
and approved technology. There 
is 
also 
a 
separate 
nightsoil 
system 
which 
removes 
about 
4,700 
t/d 
of 
nightsoil 
from 
the 
urban 
area 
for 
use 
as 
fertilizer 
in 
rural 
areas. 
Master Plan 
There 
is 
a 
Solid 
Waste 
Disposal 
Master 
Plan, 
currently 
in 
draft, 
which 
sets 
out 
broad principles 
of 
comprehensive 
waste management 
and 
has an 
overall 
goal 
of 
reducing 
waste 
at 
source 
so 
that 
no 
further 
increases 
in 
total 
waste 
occur 
beyond 
2010. 
It 
also 
sets 
out 
a 
vision 
of 
a balanced 
disposal 
system 
where 
recycling,  composting and incineration 
(including 
energy recovery)  reduce 
the 
reliance 
on 
landfilling. 
This 
Master 
Plan 
needs 
to 
be 
complemented 
by 
more specific action 
plans 
providing 
detail 
on 
issues such 
as 
transportation 
of 
wastes, 
organization 
and 
finance,  closure  (or  upgrading) 
of 
existing 
dumps, 
and 
incentives 
for 
change. 
The Master 
Plan provides 
estimates 
of 
the 
change 
in 
waste 
composition 
and 
the 
anticipated 
mix of 
facilities. 
However, 
beyond 
supporting 
the 
increasing 
use 
of 
market 
approaches 
and 
the 
involvement 
of 
the 
private 
sector, there 
is 
limited 
operational detail. 
A 
key 
issue 
that 
would 
be 
addressed 
under  the 
APL 
is 
the 
importance 
of 
regional 
cooperation 
for 
addressing 
some 
issues such 
as 
major 
disposal 
facilities. 
This 
would 
be 
encouraged 
by 
the 
gradual 
shift 
of SMG 
away 
from 
operation 
of 
facilities, 
which 
should 
allow 
a 
more 
commercial 
approach 
and 
the 
identification 
of 
cost 
effective 
regional initiatives, 
where appropriate. 
Laogang 
Landfill. 
The 
existing 
Laogang 
landfill 
is 
located 
about 
60 
km 
from 
the 
center 
of 
the 
city, 
on 
reclaimed 
land 
along 
the Yangtze 
River 
estuary. 
Waste 
is 
transported 
to 
the 
site 
on 
a 
fleet 
of 
barges 
that 
collect 
from 
urban 
transfer 
stations 
and 
travel to 
the site 
along 
the 
canal 
system. 
The 
present 
landfill, 
which 
is 
nearing 
capacity, 
covers  an 
area 
of 
about 
2,000 
by 
800 
meters 
and 
has 
been 
operated 
as 
a 
controlled 
landfill, 
although 
lacking 
an 
impermeable 
liner 
and 
some 
other 
features 
of 
a 
modern 
sanitary 
landfill. 
The 
rate 
of 
utilization 
of 
the 
landfill 
is 
about 
4,900 
t/d, 
which 
is 
controlled 
mainly 
by 
the barge 
system 
and 
the transfer 
facilities 
at the docks 
of 
the 
landfill. 
The project 
would 
include 
a 
perimeter 
wall 
and 
road 
system 
which 
would 
create 
four 
large 
working 
areas, 
each about 
1,000 
by 
800 
meters, 
effectively 
doubling 
the 
area 
of 
the 
site. 
The worlung 
areas 
would 
each 
be 
divided 
into 
about 
12 operating 
cells. 
Design 
improvements 
during 
the 
feasibility 
have 
resulted 
in 
a 
number 
of 
changes 
such 
as 
increasing 
the 
worlung 
height 
of 
a 
typical 
cell 
from 
the 
current 
practices, 
to 
provide 
an 
increased 
effective volume 
of 
about 
35 
Mm3. 
This 
would 
increase 
the 
project 
working 
life 
from 
11 
to 
about 
18 
years  (at  the 
current 
filling 
rate), 
greatly  increasing 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
the 
investments. 
The 
landfill 
would 
be 
provided 
with 
a 
high 
technology 
liner 
system 
to 
prevent 
the 
escape 
of 
leachate 
from 
each 
cell. 
The 
leachate 
will 
be 
collected 
and 
treated 
in 
an 
aeration system 
and then 
discharged 
by 
pipeline  to 
a 
major 
domestic 
wastewater 
treatment 
plant. 
A 
landfill 
gas 
collection 
system 
would 
be 
installed. 
In 
the 
initial 
years 
the 
gas 
would 
be 
flared, 
until 
sufficient 
volumes 
are 
being 
released 
for 
power 
generation 
to 
be 
a 
realistic option. 
In 
addition, 
the 
project 
would 
include 
a 
trenched 
vertical 
wall 
around 
the 
current  site 
to 
contain any 
leachate 
that 
may 
be 
lealung 
and 
the leachate 
system 
from 
the 
earlier 
stage 
would be 
linked into 
the 
new 
system. 
Other 
design details 
are 
in 
line 
with 
modem 
practice 
- 
69 
- 
Page  74
and the design 
has 
been 
reviewed 
and revised 
to 
obtain 
a 
cost-effective 
approach. 
Food 
Waste. 
The existing 
waste 
collection 
system 
has 
been severely stressed 
by 
the recent 
ban 
on food 
waste 
being 
taken 
for 
pig 
food. 
One 
consequence 
has 
been that 
there 
are 
insufficient 
collection 
vehicles 
and 
even those 
which 
are 
available 
are 
not 
adequate 
to 
transport  the 
typically 
very 
wet 
wastes. 
As 
a 
result, 
there 
has 
been 
considerable 
spillage 
and 
leakage 
during 
transport 
of 
the 
wastes. 
The 
project 
would 
help 
with 
the 
purchase 
of 
sealed 
containers 
and 
appropriate 
vehicles. 
There 
are 
a 
number 
of 
pilots 
under 
way 
for 
treating 
and 
disposing 
of 
the 
waste 
and later 
phases 
of 
the 
APL 
may 
support the 
implementation 
of 
technical 
solutions, 
if 
appropriate. 
Consideration 
of 
Alternatives 
There 
is 
no 
real 
altemative 
to 
the 
Laogang 
site 
for 
the necessary 
short 
to medium 
expansion 
of 
landfill 
capacity 
for 
Shanghai.  Shanghai’s 
growth 
continues, 
especially 
in 
the 
suburbs 
as 
efforts 
continue 
to 
reduce 
overcrowding 
in 
the 
city 
center and 
land 
prices 
are 
rising 
as 
a 
functioning 
land 
market 
starts 
to 
emerge. 
However, 
design 
improvements 
made 
during 
project 
preparation  resulted 
in 
a 
60 
percent 
increase 
in 
useable 
capacity 
for 
relatively 
small 
increases 
in 
construction 
cost. 
In 
this 
way, 
the 
efficiency 
of 
the 
planned 
investments have been increased 
significantly. 
Consideration 
was 
given 
during 
design 
to  installing 
a 
power 
generation  system 
to 
be 
fueled 
by 
the 
landfill 
gas 
collected 
but 
the 
current 
relatively 
low 
rate 
of 
gas 
production 
and 
the distance 
from 
a 
source 
of 
power 
demand made 
this 
uneconomic 
at 
present. 
However, 
a 
gas 
collection 
system 
is 
included 
in 
the 
design and 
the 
feasibility 
of 
power 
generation 
will 
be 
kept 
under 
review 
as 
the 
new 
cells 
are 
filled 
and 
capped. 
The 
food 
waste 
component 
is 
responding 
to 
an 
immediate 
need 
for 
a 
better 
collection 
system. 
No 
investments 
are 
being 
made under 
APLl 
in 
treatmentldisposal 
while 
various 
pilot 
activities continue 
in 
the 
city. 
If 
additional 
facilities 
are 
demonstrated 
to 
be 
necessary 
and 
cost 
effective, 
they 
can 
be 
considered 
for 
support under 
later 
stages 
of 
the 
APL. 
Basis 
of 
Financial and 
Economic Analysis 
An 
analysis 
has 
been 
carried out 
in 
constant 
early-2002 
prices 
based 
on 
a 
comparison 
of 
the 
“with” 
and 
“without” 
project 
scenarios. 
All 
monetary 
values 
have been evaluated 
on 
an 
incremental 
basis 
over 
the 
economic 
life 
of 
the 
main 
proposed investments 
(18 
years 
in 
the 
case 
of 
the 
Laogang project 
from 
2004 
to 
2021), 
with 
capital 
replacement 
for 
components 
with 
a  shorter 
asset 
life 
(e.g. 
6 
years 
for 
most 
machinery 
and equipment). 
Incremental 
operation and 
maintenance costs are 
included 
over 
the 
life of 
the 
assets. 
Shadowkonversion 
factors have 
been applied 
for 
the economic analysis. 
Opportunity 
cost 
of 
land. 
Discussions 
with 
property 
consultants 
in 
Shanghai 
indicate 
that 
land 
in 
the 
area 
of 
the 
Laogang 
site 
has 
a 
current 
value 
of 
Y332 
($40) 
per 
m2. 
However, 
in 
view 
of 
the 
proximity 
of 
the 
existing 
landfill 
facility, 
the value 
has 
been 
halved 
to 
Y166 
($20) 
per 
m2 
in 
order 
to 
provide 
a 
more 
realistic 
assessment 
for 
the economic  evaluation. 
The 
economic 
assessment 
includes 
the closure 
costs 
(i.e., 
environmental 
rehabilitation) 
and 
the 
residual 
land 
value 
of 
the 
landfill 
site 
at 
the 
end 
of 
its 
operational 
life 
in 
202 
1. 
The 
estimated 
capital 
cost 
is 
about 
Y1.62 
billion 
($195 
million), 
of 
which 
foreign 
exchange 
costs account 
for only 
17 
percent 
of 
the 
total--in 
financial 
prices. 
In 
economic prices, 
the 
capital 
costs 
are 
6 percent 
lower 
at 
Y1.53 
billion 
($184 
million). 
Per head 
of 
population, 
the 
investment 
for both 
the 
landfill 
and 
the 
-

- 
Page  75
food 
waste 
system 
amounts 
to 
Y260 
($31) 
per 
head 
in 
financial 
prices 
and 
Y245 
($30) 
per 
head 
in 
economic prices. 
Per household, the 
respective figures 
are 
Y720 
($87) 
in 
financial 
prices 
and 
Y675 
($81) 
in 
economic prices. 
Average 
Incremental 
Costs 
At 
a discount  rate 
of 
10 
percent 
(opportunity 
cost 
of 
capital 
used 
for 
China),  the 
average 
incremental 
costs 
(AICs) 
are 
as 
follows:

economic prices. 
The 
Chinese 
feasibility 
study 
(December 
2001) 
suggests 
an 
average charge 
of 
Y90 
($1 
1) 
per 
ton. 
Therefore, 
the design, 
review 
and advisory 
(DRA) 
consultants' 
estimates 
are 
38 
percent 
higher 
in 
financial 
prices 
and 
30 
percent 
higher 
in 
economic  prices. 
The 
difference 
is 
largely 
explained 
by 
the 
fact 
that the 
DRA 
calculations 
include 
a 
land 
value. 
Food 
Waste 
Collection: 
YlOl 
($12) 
per 
ton 
in 
financial 
prices and 
Y92 ($11) 
per ton 
in 
economic 
prices. 
The 
Shanghai 
Price Bureau 
issued the 
first 
price 
guidelines 
for 
the 
food 
waste service 
on 
December 
4, 
2001 
(Hu 
Jia 
Fei, 
2001, 
No. 
087). 
The 
document stipulates a 
maximum 
price 
of 
YlOO 
($12) 
per 
ton 
for 
collection 
and 
Y115 
($13.8) 
per 
ton 
for 
disposal. 
For 
the 
collection 
service,  the 
DRA 
estimates 
are 
very 
similar 
at 
a 
10 
percent discount 
rate. 
The 
average cost 
of 
landfill 
can 
therefore 
be 
estimated 
at 
about 
$15/t 
taken 
over 
the 
life 
of 
the 
facility. 
This 
figure 
would 
be 
at 
the 
lower 
end 
of 
comparable 
international 
costs, 
reflecting 
the 
fact 
that 
much 
of 
the 
overall required 
infrastructure 
is 
already 
in 
place, 
including 
access 
roads, 
waste-handling facilities, 
power 
supply, offices, 
etc. 
However, 
given 
the 
distance 
of 
the 
site 
from 
the 
major 
areas 
of 
generation, the 
average cost 
of 
waste 
disposal 
will 
be 
much 
higher 
than 
$15/t 
and 
will 
depend 
on 
the 
exact place 
of 
generation, 
the 
system 
of 
waste transfer, 
bulk 
haulage 
(currently 
by 
barge), 
etc. 
One 
of 
the 
tasks 
under 
the 
APL 
would 
be 
to 
introduce proper costing 
for 
different 
collection, 
transfer 
and 
disposal options 
so 
that 
the 
overall 
waste management 
system can 
be 
optimized. 
Establishing 
the 
real 
cost 
of 
the 
landfill 
option 
would 
provide 
a 
base 
reference 
cost against 
which 
other options such 
as 
recycling, 
incineration 
and composting 
can 
be 
assessed. 
It 
is 
important 
for 
the 
municipal 
authorities 
to 
recognize that 
these 
investments 
are 
creating 
an 
asset 
that 
has 
a 
total 
present 
worth 
of 
over 
half 
a 
billion 
dollars 
(based 
on 
the 
total volume 
available). 
This 
is 
a 
finite 
resource, 
which 
will 
be 
difficult 
to 
replace 
once 
it 
has 
been 
utilized, and 
it 
must 
therefore 
be 
used 
to 
generate the 
maximum 
possible 
financial 
returns and 
social benefits 
over 
its 
lifetime. 
Socioeconomic 
Survey 
Results 
The Client 
and the 
DRA 
Consultants 
commissioned 
a Socioeconomic Survey 
of 
600 
households 
and 
225 
industrial 
and 
commercial 
enterprises. Some 
of 
the 
main 
results 
relating 
to 
domestic 
solid 
waste 
and 
food 
waste 
provide useful 
insights. 
Significantly, 
the survey 
shows 
that 
households 
are 
willing 
and 
able 
to 
pay 
for 
an 
improved 
service. Some 
of 
the 
more interesting 
results 
are 
summarized 
as 
follows. 
Domestic 
solid 
waste. 
More 
than 
75 
percent 
of 
respondents 
think 
that the 
solid 
waste 
service 
is 
average 
to 
good, 
and 
about 
20 
percent 
felt 
that 
it 
was 
unsatisfactory. 
There 
is 
considerable separation 
of 
waste, 
with 
more 
than 
90 
percent 
of 
those 
interviewed 
participating. 
Less than 
5 
percent 
actually pay 
for 
the 
collection 
and 
removal 
of 
their 
solid 
waste 
but 
between 
38 
and 
45 
percent 
of 
households 
in 
the survey 
are 
reported 
to 
be 
ready 
to 
pay 
(although 
more 
than 
half 
those 
- 
71 
- 
Page  76
interviewed 
expressed 
unwillingness). However, 
on 
average, 
most urban 
households 
in 
the 
survey 
would 
accept 
paying 
Y5 
to 
6 ($0.6 
to 
0.7) 
per 
month 
for 
solid 
waste services. 
This 
willingness 
to 
pay (WTP) 
figure 
would 
amount 
to 
less 
than 
0.25 
percent 
of 
average 
household 
income 
which 
is 
Y2,124 
($256) 
per 
month 
for 
all 
districts 
in 
the 
city 
Food 
waste. 
The 
socioeconomic 
survey 
included 
75 
hotels,  restaurants 
and 
other 
catering 
outlets 
generating 
food 
waste 
in 
the 
city 
districts 
north 
and south 
of 
Suzhou Creek. 
The 
responses 
indicate 
that 
commercial 
food 
outlets 
are 
generally 
aware 
of 
the 
need 
for 
efficient 
and clean 
solid 
waste  disposal 
services, 
including 
a special service 
for 
the 
hygienic 
collection 
and disposal 
of 
food 
waste. 
Similar to 
the 
household 
survey, 
the results 
also 
indicate 
that 
enterprises 
are 
generally 
willing 
and able 
to 
pay 
for 
improved 
solid 
waste 
and 
food 
waste services. 
More 
than 
82 
percent 
of 
food 
catering 
outlets 
interviewed 
pay 
for 
the 
collection 
and 
removal 
of 
their 
general 
solid 
waste. 
Based 
on 
62 
responses, 
the 
average 
payment 
is 
Y622 
($75) 
per 
month 
for all 
solid 
waste services. 
(The 
average 
quantity 
of 
solid 
waste 
is 
1,254 
kg 
per 
month 
of 
general 
solid 
waste and 
522 
kg 
per 
month 
of 
food 
waste.) 
31 
percent 
of 
catering 
enterprises 
in 
the  survey 
are 
prepared 
to 
pay 
specifically 
for 
a 
food 
waste 
service and 
based 
on 
23 
responses, 
the average 
WTP 
is 
Y104 
($12.5) 
per 
month 
for 
a 
food 
waste 
service. 
Benefits 
Household 
payments. 
Based 
on 
the results 
of 
the 
Socioeconomic Survey 
estimates 
have been 
made 
of 
the 
incremental 
ability 
to 
pay 
for 
the 
improvement 
and 
extension 
of 
the 
domestic 
solid 
waste  services 
provided 
by 
the 
Laogang 
Landfill 
operation 
for 
Shanghai 
City. 
The 
results 
of 
the socioeconomic 
survey 
indicate 
that 
households 
are 
prepared 
to pay 
an 
average 
of 
Y5 
($0.6) 
per 
month or 
0.24 
percent 
of 
income 
for 
domestic 
solid 
waste services. 
The 
ability 
to pay 
is 
projected 
to 
rise 
from 
Y163.1 
million 
($19.6 
million) 
in 
2005 
to 
Y196.5 
million 
($23.7 
million) 
in 
2010 
and 
Y264.1 
million 
($31.8 
million) 
by 
2020, 
based 
on 
the 
same 
percentage 
but 
taking 
into 
account 
increase 
in 
household 
income. 
Property  rental 
values. 
The 
proposed 
improvement 
and 
extension 
of 
the 
services 
provided 
by 
the 
Laogang 
Landfill 
facility 
will 
allow efficient solid 
waste 
disposal 
services 
throughout 
the 
city 
to 
be 
maintained, 
which 
will 
help 
to 
sustain 
and 
enhance 
property 
values 
in 
Shanghai. 
This 
was 
confirmed 
in 
discussions 
with 
the 
Shanghai 
Municipal 
Housing, 
Land 
and 
Resources 
Administration 
Bureau, and 
local 
property consul 
tan 
ts 
. 
Residential household 
rents  have been 
used 
as 
a 
proxy 
for 
enhanced 
property 
values 
and a 
general 
approach 
has 
been adopted 
based 
on 
assuming 
a 
small 
increase 
in 
residential property 
rents. 
These 
estimates amount assuming 
that 
about 
3 
percent 
of 
the 
increase 
in 
rents can 
be 
attributed 
to 
the general 
cleanliness 
of 
the 
urban 
environment. 
This 
amounts 
to 
between 
0.2 
and 
0.4 
percent 
of 
average 
household 
income. 
The 
value 
of 
such 
an incremental 
portion 
residential property 
rents 
are 
projected 
to 
rise 
from 
Y56.1 
million 
($6.7 
million) 
in 
2005 
to 
Y171 
million 
($20.6 
million) 
in 
2010 
and 
Y463.2 
million 
($55.8 
million) 
by 
2020. 
The 
estimated 
residential 
property 
benefits 
will 
not 
reflect 
the 
total potential 
property benefits. 
This 
is 
particularly significant 
for 
the business 
districts and 
the 
industrial 
enterprises 
within 
the 
Outer 
Ring 
Road 
which 
are 
expected 
to 
mainly 
tertiary 
industries 
under the Shanghai 
Master 
Plan: 
and, 
therefore,  more 
conscious 
of 
the need 
for 
modem 
urban 
services 
and 
an 
improved 
living 
environment 
for 
which 
they 
will

be 
prepared 
to 
pay higher property 
prices and rents. 
Food 
waste 
service. 
The 
results 
of 
the 
socioeconomic survey 
indicate 
that 
food 
catering 
outlets 
(hotels, 
restaurants, 
and 
others) 
in 
Shanghai 
are 
aware 
of 
the 
need 
for 
hygienic 
disposal 
of 
food 
waste 
and 
are 
willing 
to 
pay 
for 
the  service. 
The 
survey 
respondents 
in 
the 
commercial  catering 
sector 
indicated 
average 
food 
waste 
of 
522 
kg 
per 
month 
and 
a 
willingness 
to 
pay 
of 
Y104 
($12.5) 
per 
month 
for 
a 
disposal 
service, 
which 
is 
equivalent 
to 
an average 
value 
of 
Y200 
($24) 
per 
ton. 
On 
December 
4, 
2001, 
the Shanghai 
Price 
Bureau 
(SPB) 
issued 
the 
price 
guidelines 
for 
the 
proposed 
food 
waste 
service 
(Hu 
Jia 
Fei, 
2001, 
No. 
087). 
The 
document 
stipulates 
a 
maximum 
charge 
of 
YlOO 
($12) 
per 
ton 
for 
collection 
and 
Y115 
($13.8) 
per 
ton 
for 
disposal. 
The combined 
charge 
of 
Y215 
($26) 
per 
ton 
is 
very 
similar to 
the 
willingness 
to 
pay 
figure 
derived 
from 
the 
socioeconomic survey. 
Rates 
of 
return. 
These 
benefits,  estimated 
above, 
can 
be 
attributed 
to 
the 
broad 
improvement 
of 
the 
municipal solid 
waste management 
and 
demonstrated 
that the 
project 
can 
contribute 
to 
the 
achievement 
of 
significant 
benefits. 
However, 
the 
full 
amount 
of 
the 
benefits 
cannot 
be 
attributed to 
the investments 
under 
this 
project 
and 
so 
it 
is 
not 
appropriate 
to 
use 
the 
broad 
benefits 
to 
calculate specific 
rates 
of 
return 
for 
these 
investments. 
Public 
health 
benefits. 
These 
have 
been discussed 
previously, 
together 
with

Urban 
Planning and Pilot 
Upgrading. 
This 
component 
will 
support 
rehabilitation 
of 
some 
of 
the 
older 
and 
poorer 
areas 
of 
the 
inner 
urban 
area, 
to 
provide 
immediate improvement 
in 
environmental 
services 
and 
also 
to 
establish 
physical 
parameters 
and 
institutional 
mechanisms 
which 
can 
be 
used 
on 
a larger 
scale. 
The 
focus 
of 
the 
rehabilitation 
is 
the 
Hongkou District, 
where 
there 
is 
high 
density 
housing 
and 
a 
source 
of 
recognized 
cultural 
heritage 
sites. 
The 
District 
Government 
has 
prepared a 
Plan 
to 
control 
rapid 
and 
intrusive 
new 
development, 
upgrade 
conditions 
for 
the 
residents 
and 
preserve 
the 
heritage 
assets. 
Housing 
renewal 
and renovation 
will 
be 
mainly 
carried 
out 
by 
the 
District 
Government program. 
The 
component 
would 
be  a 
pilot 
program, 
with 
the 
objective 
of 
upgrading 
the 
housing 
quality 
and 
services 
in 
the 
area 
while 
preserving 
the 
overall 
neighborhood 
character. 
If 
this 
can 
be 
carried 
out 
successfully, 
it 
would 
allow 
significant 
benefits 
to 
accrue 
to 
those 
who 
chose 
to 
remain 
in 
the 
area, 
while 
also 
providing 
the 
opportunity 
for 
those 
who 
wish 
to 
move 
to 
more 
spacious 
accommodation 
further out 
from 
the 
city 
center. 
Since 
this 
is 
one 
of 
the 
poorer 
areas 
of 
the 
city, 
achieving 
this 
objective 
would 
have 
social 
and 
economic 
benefits. 
Since 
this 
component 
is 
focusing 
on identifying 
cost 
effective 
approaches 
to 
upgrading 
the 
services 
in 
the 
older 
areas 
and 
on 
helping 
the 
District 
Government 
to 
find 
ways 
to 
increase 
the 
value 
of 
these 
neighborhoods, 
it 
is 
not 
possible 
at 
this 
stage 
to 
estimate rates 
of 
return 
to 
investments. 
An 
output 
of 
this 
work 
should 
be 
a 
much 
better understanding 
of 
the 
costs 
and benefits 
of 
upgrading 
efforts 
in 
the 
older 
historic 
parts 
of 
Shanghai. 
Upper 
Huanmu 
Catchment 
Environmental 
Management. 
SMG 
established  the  Shanghai 
Water 
Authority 
in 
2000 
with 
a 
mandate 
to 
address 
water 
resources 
and water 
quality 
in 
the 
whole 
area 
of 
the 
Municipality. 
It 
has, 
in 
its 
short 
existence, 
identified 
the 
protection 
of 
the 
Upper 
Huangpu 
catchment 
as 
a 
critical 
factor 
for 
the water 
supply 
of 
the 
city 
but 
has 
not 
yet 
been able 
to 
pay 
it 
adequate 
attention. 
This 
component 
would 
provide 
assistance 
for 
the 
development 
of 
an 
Upper Huangpu 
Catchment Management 
Plan 
and 
would 
support  a 
number 
of 
pilot 
investments 
in 
municipal 
and 
agricultural 
wastewater 
treatment. 
Among 
the 
objectives 
of 
this 
work 
are 
to 
develop

interventions 
and 
to 
promote 
the 
institutional 
and 
financial 
mechanisms 
to 
ensure 
that investments 
under 
a 
future 
Catchment Management 
Plan 
would 
be 
sustainable. 
Any 
mechanisms 
that 
increase the 
financial 
costs 
to 
agriculture 
(even 
if 
these are 
based 
on 
the 
polluter 
pays 
principle) may 
have an 
impact 
on 
the 
viability 
of 
individual 
enterprises 
or 
categories 
of 
rural 
industry 
and 
these 
impacts 
will 
be 
analyzed 
and 
addressed 
if 
necessary. 
A 
number 
of 
possible 
priority 
interventions 
have 
been 
identified, 
including 
three 
wastewater  treatment 
plants  that 
would 
treat 
both  municipal 
wastes 
and 
wastes 
from 
intensive 
agricultural 
activities. 
Evaluation 
of 
these 
investments 
would 
be 
against cost 
effectiveness 
in 
reduction 
of 
loads 
on 
the 
river 
system, 
including both 
oxygen 
demand and nutrients. 
This 
analysis 
would 
help 
to 
define 
values 
for 
unit 
reductions 
in 
key 
pollutants 
and 
these 
would 
be 
used 
as 
benchmarks 
for 
the 
evaluation 
of 
interventions 
under 
the 
Catchment Management 
Plan.

Finances 
1. 
Assumptions 
for 
Financial 
Projections. 
The 
assumptions 
made 
when 
calculating 
the 
projections 
of 
the 
on-budget 
and 
off-budget 
revenue 
and 
expenditure 
statements 
of 
Shanghai 
Municipality 
(SM) 
for 
the 
period 
1999-2008 
are 
set 
out 
below. 
Financial 
revenues are those 
arising 
from 
taxes, 
levies, 
administrative 
fees 
and other 
revenues. 
2. 
Revenue Forecast. 
The 
actual 
(1999-2002) 
financial 
revenue 
figures have 
been 
derived 
from 
data 
provided 
by 
the  Shanghai 
Finance 
Bureau 
(SFB). 
To 
estimate 
future 
revenues,  an 
overall 
conservative 
average 
annual 
increase 
of 
about 
10 
percent 
in 
current 
tem 
has 
been 
assumed 
using 
2002 
as 
the 
base 
year. 
3. 
Expenditure 
Forecast. 
Between 
1998 and 2002, 
budgetary expenditures registered 
or 
projected 
to 
register, 
between 122 
and 126 percent 
of 
revenues. 
SFB projects 
the 
ratio 
of 
expenditures 
to 
revenues 
to 
remain 
high 
through 
2010. 
To 
estimate 
future 
expenditures,  an 
overall 
average 
annual 
increase 
of 
about 
10 
percent 
in 
current 
terms 
has 
been assumed 
using 
2002 
as 
the base year.

The self-funding, self-accounting 
state-owned Shanghai 
Municipal 
Sewerage 
Company 
(SMSC) 
was 
established 
in 
December 
1995, 
following 
the 
merger 
of 
the 
existing 
Shanghai 
Sewerage 
Company 
and 
the 
Shanghai Sewerage 
Project 
Construction Company 
(SSPCC). 
Since 
its 
establishment, 
SMSC 
has 
performed well, 
institutionally, financially 
and 
technically. 
In 
2000, 
and 
as 
part 
of 
SMG’s 
restructuring 
initiatives, 
SMSC 
was 
reorganized, 
creating 
three 
operating 
companies 
and 
the  Shanghai 
Water 
& 
Environment Engineering 
Company 
(SWEC), 
while 
retaining 
the 
SMSC Group 
Company. 
The 
SMSC 
Group 
Company retains 
all 
wastewater 
assets, 
and 
hires 
the 
operating 
companies 
on 
a 
contract 
basis 
to 
undertake  operation  and  maintenance 
of 
the 
sewerage 
facilities. 
The 
role 
of 
SWEC 
is 
that 
of 
a 
construction-engineering 
firm 
(similar 
to 
the 
role 
of 
SSPCC 
in 
the 
First 
Shanghai 
Sewerage 
Project--Loan 
2794-CWCredit 
1779-CHA). 
SMSC 
and 
SWEC 
report 
to 
the Shanghai 
Water 
Authority 
(SWA), 
established 
in 
2000, 
combining 
the 
former 
Water 
Conservancy Bureau, the Shanghai 
Municipal 
Waterworks Company 
(SMWC), 
and 
SMSC 
Group 
Company, 
which 
previously 
reported 
to 
the 
Shanghai 
Public 
Utilities 
Bureau, 
and 
the Shanghai 
Municipal 
Engineering 
Bureau, 
respectively.

In 
Jinshan 
District, 
two 
wastewater 
projects 
would 
be 
undertaken. 
The 
Jinshan 
Ocean 
Outfall 
Engineering 
General 
Company 
Limited 
(JOOC) 
was 
established 
in 
1993 
as 
a 
self-funding, 
self-accounting 
state-owned 
enterprise. 
JOOC reports to 
the 
Jinshan 
Urban 
Construction 
& 
Development 
General 
Corporation 
(JUDIC). 
In 
2002 
Fengjing 
township 
established a 
similar 
enterprise 
named 
the 
Fengjing 
Water Purification 
Company 
Limited 
(FWPC). 
It 
reports 
to 
the 
Jinshan 
District 
Construction 
Commission. 
In 
Fengxian 
District, 
the 
Nanpai 
Sewage 
Disposal 
Company 
Limited 
(NSDC) 
was 
established 
in 
2002. 
It 
reports 
to 
the 
Fengxian 
District 
Construction Commission. 
Both 
districts 
have 
recently 
introduced 
wastewater 
tariffs 
of 
Y0.68/m3, 
the 
tariffs 
being 
collected 
the 
by 
districts’ 
water

Assumptions 
to 
the 
projections 
of 
the 
main 
financial 
statements 
of 
the 
Shanghai 
Municipal 
Sewerage 
Company 
Ltd. 
(SMSC) 
and 
district 
wastewater  companies 
of 
Jinshan 
District: 
(a) 
Fengjing 
Water 
Purification 
Company 
Limited 
(FWPC); 
(b) 
Jinshan

Engineering 
General Company 
Limited 
(JOOC); 
and 
(c) 
Fengxian 
District: Nanpai 
Sewage 
Disposal 
Company 
Limited 
(NSDC), 
for 
the 
period 
2002-2015 have 
been prepared. 
7. 
Inflation 
and 
Exchange Rates. 
Yearly 
general domestic 
inflation 
rates used 
in 
the 
projections 
are 
2  percent 
in 
2003 
and  2004  and 
3 
percent 
in 
2005 
and 
thereafter. 
Foreign price 
increases 
are 
estimated 
at 
1.7 
percent 
in 
2003, 
2.2 
percent 
in 
2004, 
2.0 
percent 
in 
2005 
and 
thereafter. 
The 
exchange 
rate 
used 
to 
convert 
foreign 
costs 
to 
local 
currency, 
where 
applicable, 
was 
Y8.3 
per 
$1.0. 
It 
is 
assumed 
that 
exchange 
rate 
adjustments 
would, 
on 
average, 
maintain 
purchasing 
power parity 
over 
the 
projection 
period. 
Income Statement 
8. 
Sales. 
Projections 
of 
sewage 
quantities 
are 
based 
on 
“minimum 
demand” 
and 
maximum 
capacity 
figures,  and at the 
equivalent 
of 
100 percent 
of 
water 
supplied 
and 
billed 
to 
the Shanghai 
Municipal 
Waterworks 
Company’s 
(SMWC) 
domestic 
consumers, 
and 
90 
percent 
of 
water 
supplied 
to 
nondomestic 
consumers. 
Other operating 
revenue 
for 
SMSC 
is 
derived 
from 
the 
proceeds 
of 
the 
5 
percent 
public 
utilities 
tax 
collected 
by 
SMWC 
as 
part 
of 
its 
water 
supply 
tariffs, 
which 
are 
turned 
over 
to 
SMSC 
monthly. 
Nonoperating 
income 
includes 
transfers 
from 
SMG 
to 
cover the 
costs 
incurred 
by 
SMSC 
in 
stormwater 
removal, 
estimated 
to 
be 
23.5 
percent 
of 
SMSC’s 
operations and maintenance 
costs. 
9. 
Tariffs. 
The 
following 
average 
tariffs 
expressed 
in 
yuan per 
m3 
have 
been 
estimated 
for 
the 
years 
2003 
to 
2008, 
in 
order 
to 
meet 
SMG’s  financial 
objectives for: 
(a) 
SMSC, 
including 
malung 
a 
contribution 
to 
capital investment 
of 
10 
percent; 
and 
(b) 
the 
district 
wastewater  companies 
of 
Jinshan 
District: 
FWPC 
and 
JOOC, 
and 
Fengxian 
District: 
NSDC. 
The 
legal 
procedures 
of SMG 
would 
need 
to 
be followed 
before 
any 
tariff 
adjustment 
is 
authorized and implemented.

10. 
Operating 
Costs. 
Salaries, 
wages 
and staff 
benefits 
are assumed 
to 
increase 
at 
the 
rates 
given 
in 
para. 
8 
above. 
Energy, materials and other 
costs 
are 
assumed 
to 
increase 
in 
line 
with 
general 
inflation 
also. 
Long-term 
assets 
are 
depreciated 
at 
2.5 
percent 
(40 
years) 
and 
short-term 
assets 
at 
6.67 
percent (15 
years). 
The 
split 
of 
assets 
is 
assumed 
at 
80 
percent 
long-term 
and 20 
percent 
short-term,  based 
on 
project 
cost 
estimates 
and 
information 
supplied 
from 
SMSC. The 
composite 
depreciation 
rate 
is 
3.8 
percent. 
It 
is 
assumed 
SMSC 
and 
the 
district 
wastewater companies 
would 
pay 
a 
business 
tax 
of 
3.7 
percent a 
year and 
income 
tax 
of 
33 percent. 
11. 
Interest 
and 
Amortization 
Expenses. 
The 
proceeds 
of 
the 
IBRD 
loan 
are assumed 
to 
be 
onlent 
to 
the wastewater companies 
at 3.0 
percent a 
year. 
Amortization 
of 
loans 
would 
be on 
the 
basis 
of 
equal 
payments 
of 
principal 
and interest. 
The 
companies 
would 
bear 
the 
foreign 
exchange 
risk. 
Shanghai 
Municipality would 
provide 
the 
local 
capital

funds 
as 
capital 
grants.

Procurement and Disbursement 
Arrangements 
CHINA: Shanghai Urban Environment 
Project 
Procurement 
1. 
Procurement Capacity 
Assessment 
Two 
sets 
of 
procurement 
laws 
and regulations 
exist 
in 
China 
for 
procurement 
administration--Chinese  regulations, and 
procedures 
for 
procurement 
financed 
by 
external 
donors. 
Bank-financed 
procurement 
has 
been 
carried out 
satisfactory 
through 
exemptions 
to 
the 
domestic 
bidding 
requirements. 
The 
Chinese 
procurement 
regulations 
for 
national 
competitive 
bidding 
(NCB) 
are 
prescribed 
in 
the 
Shanghai 
Administration 
Regulation 
on 
Tendering 
and 
Bidding 
of 
Construction 
Projects, 
issued 
by 
Shanghai 
Municipal 
Government 
in 
1998. 
Provisions 
in 
these 
regulations 
that 
are 
inconsistent 
with 
Bank 
procurement 
Guidelines 
are: 
the 
merit point 
system, 
used 
for 
the 
pre-qualification 
evaluation 
and 
bid 
evaluation; 
limit 
on 
the 
number 
of 
bidders; 
rejection 
of 
bids 
outside 
a 
narrow 
price 
range; 
application 
of 
a geographic 
preference 
through 
use 
of 
a 
prior 
approval 
procedure; 
low 
bid 
security, 
ranging 
from 
0.05 
to 
1 
percent; 
levy 
of 
a 
charge 
of 
0.02 
percent 
of 
the 
contract 
price 
to 
the 
Construction 
Project 
Bidding 
and 
Tendering 
Office 
as 
administration 
fee; 
short 
bidding 
period 
(as 
little 
as 
20 
days); 
and 
selection 
of 
local 
construction supervision 
firms 
using 
the 
same 
procedures 
as 
for 
civil 
works 
contracts. 
2. 
Special provisions 
in 
the 
Chinese 
public 
procurement 
regulations  specify 
that 
Bank-financed 
procurement 
is 
exempt 
from 
the 
requirement 
to 
observe 
Chinese 
bidding 
regulations. 
In 
past 
Bank-financed  projects 
in 
Shanghai, 
Bank 
procurement  guidelines 
and 
procedures 
have 
been  used 
satisfactorily 
without 
exception. 
The 
State 
Development 
& 
Reform 
Commission 
(SDRC) 
issued 
instructions 
in 
2000 
regarding 
bid 
invitation notification 
in 
designated 
national 
newspapers. 
Bid 
notices 
are 
also 
posted 
in 
the 
various 
ministry 
websites. 
3. 
The Project 
Office 
(PO) 
has 
been designated 
as 
the 
main 
coordinating 
agency 
for 
APL1. 
Under 
APL1, 
the 
urban 
wastewater 
component 
is 
the 
largest 
component  (about 
67 
percent). 
It 
would 
be 
implemented 
by 
the Shanghai 
Water and 
Environment 
Company 
(SWEC), 
on 
behalf 
of 
the 
Shanghai 
Municipal 
Sewerage 
Company (SMSC) under 
a 
contractual 
arrangement. 
The 
staff 
of 
SWEC, 
which 
has 
been 
drawn 
from 
SMSC, 
has 
considerable experience 
of 
World 
Bank 
procurement 
procedures through 
implementing 
Bank-financed  projects over 
the  past 
15 
years. 
SWEC 
has 
considerable 
experience 
in 
implementing international competitive 
bidding 
(ICB) 
and 
NCB 
procurement under 
three 
Bank-financed 
projects. 
All 
procurement 
and 
project 
management 
is 
handled 
by 
the 
Planning 
and Technology 
Unit 
of 
SWEC. 
SWEC 
has 
a 
solid 
core 
of 
professional 
staff, and 
has 
continuously 
engaged 
external 
consultants 
to 
assist 
in 
construction supervision 
and contract 
administration. 
SWEC 
would 
be 
directly 
responsible 
for 
procurement 
of 
the 
urban 
wastewater 
component 
under 
APLl 
on 
behalf 
of 
SMSC. The 
latter 
would 
sign 
all 
procurement 
contracts, 
however, 
as 
it 
is 
the 
borrower 
of 
World 
Bank 
loan 
proceeds. 
4. 
SWEC 
has 
the 
specific 
responsibility 
under 
APLl 
to 
assist 
and 
advise 
"new" 
project 
management 
offices  (PMOs) 
in 
procurement 
management. 
One 
training 
workshop 
has 
already 
been 
carried out 
for 
implementing 
agency 
staff. 
Further training 
would 
be 
carried out 
when 
procurement 
staff 
are 
recruited 
by 
the 
"new" 
project 
agencies. 
The 
other 
PMOs 
would 
recruit 
procurement 
agents 
to 
assist 
them 
in 
procurement 
management 
and 
contract administration. 
5. 
Major 
actions  agreed 
during 
the 
Procurement 
Capacity 
Assessment 
Report 
(a 
copy 
is 
in 
the 
Project 
File, 
see 
Annex 
8) 
include: 
(a) 
individual PMOs 
would 
appoint 
experienced  and 
adequately 
qualified 
staff 
dedicated 
for 
procurement activities; 
(b) 
all 
PMOs 
should 
select 
their 
ICB 
procurement

agents; 
and 
(c) 
SWEC 
will 
update 
its 
procurement 
manual 
for 
procurement 
staff 
in 
all 
PMOS. 
6. 
Procurement 
procedures and arrangements 
satisfactory 
to 
the 
Bank, 
as 
reflected 
in 
Table 
A, 
were 
agreed 
upon 
with 
the 
Project 
Office 
(PO) 
and the 
implementing 
agencies. 
All 
procurement 
would 
be 
undertaken 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
Bank 
Group’s  Procurement Guidelines, 
January 
1995 and 
revised 
in 
January 
and 
August 
1996 
and 
January  1999, 
and “Selection 
and 
Employment 
of 
Consultants 
by 
World 
Bank 
Borrowers” 
dated January  1997 
and 
revised 
in 
September  1997, January 
1999 
and 
May 
2002. 
Chinese 
Model 
Bidding 
Documents 
and 
Bank 
Standard 
Bidding 
Documents 
would 
be 
used 
for 
procurement 
of 
goods 
and works. 
7. 
Civil 
Works. 
The total 
of 
civil 
works 
is 
estimated at about 
$308.3 
million, 
of 
which 
about 
$36.1 
million 
(12 
percent) 
would 
be 
procured 
using 
ICB 
procedures. 
ICB 
procedures 
would 
be 
used 
for 
all civil 
works 
contracts 
of 
estimated  value  over 
$10.0 
million 
equivalent 
each. 
Civil 
works 
that 
are 
small, 
scattered 
or 
scheduled 
too 
far 
apart 
to 
be 
packaged 
into 
larger 
contracts, 
or 
would 
not 
attract 
the 
interest 
of 
foreign 
bidders, estimated 
to 
cost about $272.2 
million 
(88 percent), 
would 
be 
awarded 
through 
NCB 
procedures,  acceptable 
to 
the 
Bank. The 
NCB 
procedures 
to 
be 
used 
in 
Shanghai 
for 
Bank-financed 
procurement have been 
reviewed 
by 
the 
Bank 
recently, 
and 
were 
found 
to 
be 
satisfactory. 
They 
include: 
use 
of 
Model 
Bidding 
Documents 
agreed 
between 
the 
Bank 
and 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Finance: 
publication 
of 
bid 
invitations 
in 
national 
newspapers; 
provision 
of 
a 
minimum 
30-day 
bidding 
period; 
use 
of 
post-qualification criteria 
as 
necessary; 
public 
bid 
opening; and 
allowance 
for 
interested 
foreign 
bidders 
to 
bid 
for 
NCB 
contracts. 
Restrictive 
practices 
applicable 
to 
procurement 
using 
on

14. 
Prior review 
procedures 
would 
be 
used 
for: 
(a) 
civil 
works 
contracts 
estimated 
to 
cost 
the equivalent 
of 
$10.0 
million 
or 
more per 
contract; 
(b) 
goods contracts 
estimated 
to 
cost 
the equivalent 
of 
$500,000 
or 
more 
per 
contract;  and 
(c) 
consultant 
services contracts 
estimated 
to 
cost the 
equivalent 
of 
$100,000 
or 
more 
per contract 
for 
firms. 
In 
the 
case 
of 
consultant 
services, 
all 
terms 
of 
reference, regardless 
of 
their 
value, 
would 
be 
subject 
to 
prior 
review. 
In 
2004, about 
20 
percent 
of 
the contracts 
not 
subject 
to 
prior 
review 
would 
be 
subject 
to 
ex-post 
review; 
the ex-post 
review 
levels 
would 
be 
reduced 
in 
subsequent 
years, 
depending 
on 
Shanghai's 
procurement performance.

PROJECT 
OBJECTIVES 
This 
project 
has 
the basic 
objective 
of 
supporting 
Shanghai 
Municipal 
Government 
(SMG) 
in 
urban 
environment 
management 
and 
in 
the sustainable 
provision 
of 
urban environment infrastructure 
services. 
It 
builds 
on 
more 
than 
15 
years 
of 
cooperation 
with 
SMG 
on 
water, 
sanitation 
and 
solid 
waste 
issues 
during 
which 
significant 
improvements 
have been 
made, 
both 
in 
service 
delivery 
and 
in 
environmental 
improvements 
in 
some 
areas 
of 
the 
city. 
In 
particular 
the 
condition 
of 
the 
Huangpu 
River, 
for 
centuries 
the 
main 
thoroughfare 
of 
Shanghai, 
has seen 
marked improvement. 
The 
project 
would 
support 
both 
management/institutional 
advances 
and 
specific 
investments 
in 
urban 
infrastructure. 
Some 
of 
these 
investments 
are 
large 
in 
size 
and 
would 
have 
significant potential 
impacts 
on 
the 
local 
environment. 
As 
a 
result, 
although 
the 
overall goal 
is 
broad 
environmental 
improvement, 
the 
APL 
has 
been 
given 
an 
environmental 
assessment 
(EA) 
“A” 
category 
in 
order 
to 
address 
possible 
negative 
impacts 
of 
individual 
components. 
Structure 
of 
the 
APL 
and 
EA 
procedures 
The 
APL 
has 
been  designed 
in 
three 
phases, 
each 
of 
which 
would 
have 
several  components. 
The 
components 
for 
the 
first 
phase 
(APLl) 
have been 
identified 
and prepared 
for 
appraisal. 
The 
components 
for 
subsequent 
phases 
have 
been 
agreed 
in 
principle 
but 
would 
be 
subject 
to 
review 
and 
revision 
as 
the 
program 
advances. 
The 
whole 
APL 
is 
subject 
to 
the 
requirements 
of 
the 
Environment 
Assessment 
Operational 
Policy 
(OP 
4.01). 
Given 
the  scale 
of 
some 
of 
the 
investments  proposed 
(wastewater 
treatment 
plants, 
landfill 
expansion, 
etc.), 
the 
overall 
APL 
has 
been 
categorized 
by 
the 
Bank 
as 
an 
“A’, 
requiring 
a 
full 
EA. 
Each 
of 
the 
components 
in 
APLl 
is 
subject 
to 
EA. 
The major 
investment 
components 
require 
state-level 
(State 
Environmental Protection 
Agency 
- 
SEPA) 
EAs 
under the Chinese 
system 
and 
have 
been 
carried 
out 
in 
a 
manner consistent 
with 
OP 
4.01 Category 
A. 
Some components 
only 
require municipal-level 
EAs 
in 
the Chinese 
system 
but 
are 
still 
subject 
to 
full 
EAs 
for Bank 
purposes. 
To 
put 
the 
individual 
investments 
in 
context 
and 
to 
address 
the 
organizational and 
policy 
dimensions 
of 
APL1, 
a 
project-wide 
EA 
summary 
has 
been 
prepared, 
together 
with 
an 
APL 
“Framework 
EA” 
which 
addresses 
the 
whole 
set 
of 
interventions 
proposed 
for 
the 
APL 
and outlines 
the 
environmental 
objectives, 
the 
monitoring 
systems 
and 
the 
EA 
review 
procedures 
that 
will 
apply 
to 
the 
APL. 
A 
supplementary 
EA 
was 
prepared 
in 
early 
2003 
to reflect 
updated 
costs 
and updated design decisions. 
APL 
Framework 
The 
broad 
framework 
for 
the 
APL 
is 
defined 
by 
the 
Tenth Five-Year  Plan 
(TFYP) 
of 
the  Shanghai 
Municipal 
Government, 
in 
its 
various 
policy 
and implementation 
documents, 
and 
by 
the 
Development 
Program 
for 
the 
APL 
agreed 
between 
SMG 
and 
the 
Bank. 
The overall objective 
is 
to 
help 
SMG 
to 
implement 
a  sustainable 
development 
strategy 
through 
efforts 
on 
environmental 
improvement 
and 
institutional 
strengthening, 
in 
order 
to 
provide 
its 
over 
13 
million 
citizens 
with 
extensive 
and 
long-term 
environmental 
benefits, 
and 
also 
to 
achieve 
the 
aims 
of 
promoting 
innovation, 
enhancing 
institutional 
reform 
and 
improving financial 
mechanisms.

The 
APL 
has 
been developed 
to 
be 
consistent 
with 
the 
different 
Master 
Plans 
in 
key 
environmental 
areas, 
as 
well 
as 
with 
the 
directions 
set 
for 
institutional reform. 
In 
broad 
terms 
the 
APL 
will 
address 
six 
broad 
areas, 
with 
the balance between 
these 
varying 
over 
the 
different 
phases 
of 
the 
APL.

The 
proposed 
coverage 
of 
the 
different 
phases 
is 
as 
follows 
(see 
Table 
1 
below 
for 
more 
detail). 
APLl: 
Major 
investments 
would 
include 
the 
completion 
of 
the sewerage 
system 
for 
the 
inner city; 
expansion 
of 
the 
city’s 
main 
landfill 
and support 
to 
other 
solid 
waste management 
(SWM) 
activities; 
urban infrastructure upgrading 
in 
Hongkou District; 
urban environment 
improvements; 
planning 
and 
initial 
investments 
in 
protection 
of 
the 
Upper  Huangpu 
Catchment 
(municipal 
wastewater 
and 
agricultural 
waste 
collection, 
treatment and disposal). 
APL2: 
This 
phase 
would 
continue 
to 
support 
SWM, 
including 
addressing 
industrial 
waste; 
would 
increase 
investments 
in 
the 
Upper Huangpu 
Catchment 
protection; 
and 
would 
expand 
the 
urban 
infrastructure upgrading efforts 
to 
poorly 
serviced 
areas. 
APL3: 
The 
third 
phase 
is 
expected 
to 
address 
the 
consolidation and 
site redevelopment 
of 
older 
urban 
wastewater 
treatment plants 
(WWTP); 
complete 
the 
establishment 
of 
systems 
for 
continued 
investment 
in 
the 
Upper  Huangpu 
Catchment; 
expand 
the  scope 
of 
the 
urban  infrastructure 
upgrading, 
and 
support a 
number 
of 
activities 
to 
address 
the 
more complex 
air 
pollution 
abatement 
problems. 
Within 
this 
broad 
outline, 
the 
specifics 
of 
each 
component 
of 
each phase 
have been 
agreed 
and 
appraised 
by 
the 
Bank 
and 
the 
appropriate 
level 
of 
environmental 
assessment  has 
been 
be 
undertaken, 
in 
accordance 
with 
Chinese 
and 
Bank 
requirements. 
Indicators 
Broad 
performance 
indicators 
have been 
set 
out 
in 
the 
Development Program 
for 
the 
main 
sectors 
being 
addressed 
in 
the 
APL. 
The 
parameters 
used 
are 
consistent 
with 
those 
set 
out 
in 
the 
TFYP 
and cover 
issues such 
as 
coverage 
of 
wastewater 
collection, 
proportion 
of 
wastewater  treated, 
efficiency 
of 
solid 
waste 
collection, 
recycling 
rates, 
per 
capita 
open 
space 
and 
green 
areas. 
In 
addition, regular 
monitoring 
of 
water 
quality 
continues, 
both 
in 
the 
urban 
reaches 
of 
the 
rivers 
and 
creeks 
and 
also 
in 
relation to 
the 
protection 
of 
the water

on 
these 
overall

BACKGROUND 
TO 
EA 
FOR 
THE 
PROJECT 
(APL1) 
The 
Shanghai 
Academy 
of 
Environmental 
Sciences 
(SAES) 
carried out 
the 
Environmental 
Assessment 
(EA) 
of 
the 
proposed Shanghai 
Urban Environment Project 
(SHLJEP), 
representing 
Phase 
1 
of 
the 
APL, 
in 
accordance 
with 
Chinese 
national 
and 
Bank 
procedures, 
with 
support 
from 
independent 
international 
consulting 
specialists. 
Various 
drafts 
were 
reviewed 
and 
discussed 
in 
detail 
during 
project 
preparation.

The  draft 
EA 
documents  were 
submitted 
to 
the 
Bank 
in 
February 
2002. 
The 
final 
EA 
Report, 
Environmental 
Action

(EAP) 
and 
Executive 
Summary 
(ES) 
were 
submitted 
to 
the 
Bank 
in 
March 
2002 
and 
found to 
be satisfactory. 
The 
EA 
Report 
was 
sent 
to 
the 
Bank’s 
Information 
Center 
in 
February 
2002. 
During 
the 
EA 
work, 
the 
local 
people 
were 
consulted, 
and 
their opinions 
have been 
reflected 
in 
the 
project 
design and 
environmental 
mitigation 
measures, 
as 
appropriate. 
A 
supplementary

BASELINE 
ENVIRONMENTAL 
DESCRIPTION 
Socioeconomic 
Situation 
Shanghai 
Municipality 
is 
one 
of 
four 
provincial-level 
cities 
in 
China 
and 
its 
largest 
urban 
center, 
with 
a 
permanent, 
registered 
population 
approaching 
14 
million 
and 
an 
additional 
temporary 
population 
of 
about 3 
million. 
The 
city 
is 
China’s 
most 
important industrial 
base, 
and 
the 
major 
center 
of 
commerce, 
trade, 
finance and 
science, 
accounting 
for 
about 
5 
percent 
of 
its 
national 
gross 
domestic 
product 
(GDP). 
The 
reported 
GDP 
per capita 
was 
the 
highest 
among the 
provinceshational-level 
cities 
in 
China 
(about 
$4,173 
in 
2000, 
more 
than 
four 
times the 
national 
average 
- 
reported figures 
would 
vary 
depending 
on 
population 
assumptions made). 
There 
is, 
nevertheless, 
a 
significant 
income disparity 
between 
the 
urban 
and 
rural 
population, 
and 
over 
3 percent 
of 
even 
the 
urban 
population 
within 
the 
municipality 
have 
an 
income 
lower 
than 
the 
locally 
defined poverty 
lines; 
in 
addition, over 
15% 
of 
the 
non-registered urban 
population 
are 
currently 
below 
the 
poverty line.

Natural 
Environment 
Shanghai 
is 
the largest and most 
heavily 
industrialized conurbation 
in 
China, 
producing 
about 
11 
percent 
of 
national industrial 
output. 
Shanghai 
Municipality, 
located 
in 
the Yangtze 
River 
delta plain, 
occupies 
an 
area 
of 
6,200  square 
kilometers 
(km2), 
of 
which 
300 
km2 
are 
classified 
as 
urban. 
The 
Shanghai 
Municipality 
area 
(population 
7.5 
million 
in 
the 
12 
districts 
in 
Shanghai 
City 
and a 
further 
6 
million 
in 
the 
adjacent suburban 
districts 
and 
one 
county) 
is 
bordered 
to 
the 
north 
by 
Jiangsu 
Province 
and 
to 
the 
east 
by 
Zhejiang 
Province. 
The 
City 
lies 
in 
a 
convergence zone 
of 
cold, 
dry 
and 
warm, 
humid 
air 
masses. 
Rainfall 
patterns 
are 
influenced both 
by 
monsoons 
and 
temperate 
cyclones.  There 
are 
well-defined 
seasons 
with 
average 
monthly 
temperatures 
ranging 
from 
3.4"C 
in 
January 
to 
27.2"C 
in 
August. 
Annual 
average 
rainfall 
is 
1,148 
millimeters 
(mm) 
with 
a 
pronounced 
rainy 
season 
from 
June 
to 
September. 
The 
prevailing 
wind 
is 
northwesterly 
in 
winter 
and 
southeasterly 
in 
summer. 
The 
Yangtze 
River 
is 
the 
longest and largest 
river 
in 
China 
and 
the 
fourth 
largest 
in 
the 
world 
in 
terms 
of 
flow. 
The 
river 
rises 
on 
the 
border 
with 
Tibet, 
and 
its 
total 
catchment 
area 
of 
1.8 
million 
km2 
covers 
approximately 19 
percent 
of 
the 
total 
land 
area 
of 
China. 
It 
traverses 
a 
total 
of 
approximately 
6,300 
river 
km 
before discharging 
to 
the East 
China 
Sea 
to 
the 
east 
of 
Shanghai. 
The 
mean net 
downstream 
flow 
in 
the Yangtze 
River 
at 
its 
most downstream 
gauging 
station 
at 
Datong 
(550 
km 
upstream 
of 
the 
confluence 
with 
the 
Huangpu) 
is 
approximately 
30,000 
cubic 
meters 
per 
second (m3/s), 
with 
typical 
dry-season 
flows 
in 
the 
range 
of 
10,000 
to 
15,000 
m3/s and 
wet-season 
flows 
in 
excess 
of 
50 
000 
m3/s. 
The 
flow 
regime 
will 
be 
modified 
as 
a 
consequence 
of 
both 
the 
Three 
Gorges 
Project 
and 
the 
major 
diversion 
of 
water 
from 
the  Yangtze 
River 
to 
the  water-short 
northern 
provinces. 
The 
diversion 
may 
reduce 
dry-season 
flows 
by 
about 
10 
percent. 
On 
an 
annual 
average basis 
the 
tidal 
inflow 
at 
the 
river 
mouth 
could 
be approximately 
266,000  m3/s, 
some 
nine 
times 
the 
average 
river flow. 
The 
inflow 
on 
a 
spring 
tide 
could 
be 
of 
the 
order 
of 
5 
billion 
m3. 
The Huangpu 
River flows 
through 
the 
Shanghai 
municipal 
area, 
discharging 
into 
the 
Yangtze 
River 
at 
Wusongkou 
some 
18 
km 
to 
the 
north 
of 
the 
city. Flows 
in 
the 
Huangpu 
are 
measured at 
the 
gauging 
station 
at 
Mishidu, 
about 
70 
km 
upstream 
of 
the 
confluence 
with 
the 
Yangtze 
River. The 
river 
is 
tidal 
at 
Mishidu 
and 
the 
mean 
net downstream 
flow 
is 
approximately 
340 
m3/s, 
about 
1 
percent 
of 
that 
in 
the 
Yangtze. 
Under 
extreme 
conditions 
of 
low 
natural 
flow 
in 
the 
Huangpu 
and 
peak 
tidal 
influence 
from 
the 
Yangtze, there 
can 
be 
net 
upward flows 
at 
Mishidu 
for 
periods 
of 
up 
to 
several 
days. 
Water 
Quality 
Water 
quality 
in 
the 
Yangtze 
River 
upstream 
of 
the 
confluence 
with 
the 
Huangpu 
is 
generally 
good. 
Existing 
wastewater  discharges 
from 
Shanghai 
through 
the 
outfalls 
at 
Zhuyuan 
and 
Bailonggang 
have 
been demonstrated 
to 
be 
well-dispersed  and have 
very 
limited 
impact 
on 
water 
quality. The 
Yangtze 
carries 
very 
substantial 
quantities 
of 
silt, 
with 
suspended 
solids 
concentrations exceeding 
500 
mg/liter 
on 
average 
and annual 
silt 
loads 
of 
the 
order 
of 
500 
million 
tons. 
In 
the estuary the 
silt 
is 
mainly 
fine 
sand 
and 
clay, 
which 
has 
a 
strong adsorption capacity 
for 
a range 
of 
pollutants, 
particularly 
heavy 
metals. 
The 
previous 
Shanghai  sewerage 
projects supported 
by 
the 
Bank 
included 
diversion 
of 
about 
2 
Mm3/d 
of 
wastewater 
from 
the 
Huangpu 
catchment 
for 
discharge 
to 
the Yangtze 
through 
long 
tunneled outfalls 
at 
Zhuyuan and Bailonggang. 
Monitoring 
of 
water 
quality 
in 
the 
Yangtze 
River 
in 
the 
region 
of 
these 
outfalls 
has 
shown 
that 
the 
discharges are 
well-dispersed 
with 
minimal 
impact 
on 
local 
water quality. 
The quality 
of 
the 
Yangtze 
River, 
in 
particular 
the 
concentrations 
of 
nutrients 
nitrogen 
and 
phosphorus, 
is 
also 
important 
in 
that 
it 
is 
a 
major 
source 
of 
water 
entering 
Hangzhou Bay, 
which 
is 
experiencing 
increasing problems 
of 
red 
tides. 
The 
Yangtze 
receives 
numerous 
discharges 
of 
urban 
and 
industrial 
wastewater 
and extensive drainage 
from 
agricultural 
areas. 
As 
a result,  concentrations 
of 
nitrogen 
and 
- 
105 
- 
Page  110
phosphorus 
are 
high, 
particularly 
during 
the 
dry 
season 
when 
concentrations 
are 
of 
the 
order 
of 
0.5 
mg/l 
and 
0.17 
mg/l 
on 
average 
respectively,  and 
the 
Yangtze 
accounts 
for 
up 
to 
90 
percent 
of 
the 
nutrient 
loads 
entering 
Hangzhou Bay. The 
loads 
are 
dominated 
by 
agriculture 
(fertilizer runoff) 
in 
the 
case 
of 
nitrogen 
and 
animal 
wastes 
in 
the 
case 
of 
phosphorus. 
Control 
of 
point-source 
loads 
from 
urban 
wastewater 
would 
not 
in 
isolation 
be 
sufficient 
to 
reduce 
the 
nutrient 
loads 
of 
the 
Yangtze substantially. 
Significant 
reductions 
in 
these 
loads 
would 
require 
comprehensive 
agricultural 
waste 
and 
fertilizer 
management 
on 
a catchment-wide 
basis. 
All 
sources 
of 
the 
Huangpu 
are 
generally 
of 
good quality 
although 
showing 
some 
evidence 
of 
decline. 
However 
water 
quality 
in 
the 
Huangpu 
declines 
significantly 
as 
it 
traverses 
the Shanghai 
Municipality 
area 
as 
a 
result 
of 
discharges 
of 
domestic 
and 
industrial 
wastewater and 
runoff 
from 
agricultural 
areas. 
Water 
quality 
problems 
are 
exacerbated 
under 
conditions 
of 
low 
natural 
flow 
in 
the Huangpu, when 
the 
tidal 
influence 
of 
the 
Yangtze 
River 
causes 
extensive 
upstream movement 
of 
pollution 
from 
the 
lower 
reaches 
of 
the 
river. 
Water 
quality 
in 
the 
Huangpu 
in 
the 
urban 
area has 
progressively 
improved 
as 
a 
result 
of 
the 
major 
sewerage 
investments  undertaken 
by 
SMG 
based 
on 
a 
policy 
of 
diversion 
of 
wastewater 
out 
of 
the 
Huangpu 
catchment 
for 
discharge 
into 
the  Yangtze. 
However, 
in 
the 
Upper 
Huangpu, where the 
key 
strategic water 
supply 
intake 
at 
Daqiao 
is 
located, 
there 
is 
evidence 
of 
declining 
water 
quality 
as 
a 
result 
of 
discharges 
of 
untreated 
wastewater 
from 
the 
outlying 
districts 
and 
from 
agriculture, 
particularly 
intensive animal 
rearing. 
Future 
Water Quality 
Objectives 
The  future 
water 
quality 
objective 
for 
the 
Huangpu 
is 
the  Category 
III 
standard 
of 
the 
Chinese 
Environmental Quality 
Classification, 
representing  water 
quality 
suitable 
for 
abstraction 
of 
water 
and 
potable 
supply 
after 
treatment. 
Although 
it 
has 
considerable 
assimilative 
capacity, 
there 
is 
concern 
at 
a 
national 
level 
in 
respect 
of 
a 
potential 
decline 
in 
water 
quality 
in 
the Yangtze. 
This 
concern 
is 
largely 
as 
a 
consequence 
of 
the 
changing 
flow 
regime 
in 
the Yangtze 
arising 
out 
of 
its 
strategic 
role 
in 
China’s  water 
resources 
through 
the 
key 
water transfer 
project, 
and 
also 
the 
implications 
of 
water 
storage 
in 
the Three 
Gorges 
Dam. 
As 
a 
result 
of 
these 
concerns, 
water 
quality 
objectives 
for 
the Yangtze 
River 
over 
its 
entire 
length 
have 
been made 
more 
stringent, the target 
being 
Category 
II. 
Water 
and 
Wastewater Management 
The overall 
water 
consumption 
in 
Shanghai 
is 
8.5 
million 
cubic 
meters 
per 
day 
(Mm3/day) 
The 
citywide 
wastewater generated 
is 
5.75 
Mm3/day, 
including 
0.7 
Mm3/day 
of 
groundwater 
infiltration. 
The 
present 
citywide 
collection 
rate 
is 
about 
68 
percent, 
and about 
1.8 
Mm3/day 
(32 percent) 
of 
wastewater 
generated 
flows 
directly 
to 
the 
local 
river 
system. These data 
imply 
a 
current 
system 
utilization 
rate 
of 
about 
60 
percent. 
The 
present 
level 
of 
treatment 
(defined 
as 
a 
level 
higher 
than 
primary 
treatment) 
is 
11 
percent. 
The 
overall principles 
of 
the 
recently 
updated Shanghai Wastewater 
Master 
Plan 
are 
as 
follows: 
0 
0 
0 
0 
Major

use 
of 
the 
Yangtze

Estuary’s assimilative 
capacity, 
increasing 
levels 
of 
treatment 
in 
future, 
as 
appropriate; and 
- 
106- 
Page  111
0 
Sludge management 
policy 
based 
on 
minimization, pollutant 
source 
control 
to 
minimize toxicity 
and 
use 
as 
a 
resource, whenever 
possible. 
The 
total 
estimated 
wastewater 
flow 
for 
the year 
2020 
is 
8.5 
Mm3/d. 
The 
discharge standard appropriate 
for 
treated wastewater 
discharged 
to 
the 
Yangtze 
River 
is 
the 
national integrated 
wastewater  discharge 
standard and 
this 
is 
the 
long-term 
objective 
for 
all 
treated 
wastewater  discharges 
from 
Shanghai. 
The 
present 
proposal 
for 
the discharge 
at 
Zhuyuan 
is 
for 
secondary treatment. 
The 
additional 
pollution 
load 
removed 
by 
secondary 
treatment 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
chemically 
enhanced 
primary 
treatment 
process 
proposed, 
at 
least 
as 
an 
interim 
measure, 
for 
the 
other 
discharges 
to 
the  Yangtze  at 
Zhuyuan 
and 
Bailonggang 
is 
modest 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
very large assimilative 
capacity 
of 
the Yangtze 
River 
Estuary. 
However, 
the 
additional 
cost 
of 
secondary 
treatment 
relative 
to 
chemically 
assisted 
primary 
treatment 
is 
substantial, 
in 
the 
order 
of 
double 
on 
a 
capital 
cost basis. 
Moreover, 
the 
chemical 
process 
is 
at 
least 
as 
effective 
as 
secondary 
treatment 
in 
terms 
of 
the 
removal 
of 
the 
important 
pollutant 
phosphorus. 
The 
final 
selection 
of 
treatment 
processes 
to 
meet secondary 
treatment 
discharge standards 
would 
be 
made 
during 
the detailed 
design 
stage. 
Wastes 
Management 
The 
quantity 
of 
waste generated 
in 
Shanghai 
is 
very 
substantial and 
disposal 
costs 
are 
high 
because 
of 
the 
lack 
of 
disposal 
opportunities 
in 
or 
close 
to 
the 
urban 
area. 
The 
municipal solid 
waste 
in 
Shanghai 
contains a 
high 
proportion 
of 
organic 
waste 
and therefore 
has 
a 
high 
moisture 
content, 
which 
restricts 
effective 
treatmenddisposal  options.  There 
is 
some 
degree 
of 
recycling 
of 
certain 
components 
of 
municipal solid 
waste 
in 
Shanghai 
but 
generally 
on 
an 
informal 
basis. 
The 
major 
Laogang 
landfill 
site that 
receives 
municipal solid 
waste 
from 
the 
urban 
area 
of 
Shanghai 
has 
been 
developed 
in 
two 
stages, 
beginning 
operation 
in 
1989. 
The 
site 
is 
located 
some 
60 
km 
from 
the 
Shanghai 
city 
center 
on 
the 
East 
China 
Sea 
coast 
in 
Nanhui District. 
The 
Phase 
1 
site 
capacity 
was 
3,000 
t/d 
of 
solid 
waste, 
based 
on 
a 
filling 
area 
of 
3,000 
mu 
(200 
ha), 
and 
this 
was 
increased 
to 
6,000 
t/d 
in 
1992. 
Although 
there 
is 
effective 
cover 
for 
deposited 
waste, 
compaction 
of 
waste 
on 
the 
site 
is 
limited 
to 
that  achieved 
by 
the 
bulldozers 
used 
for 
movement 
and  spreading 
of 
waste 
within 
the 
site,  and the 
controls 
on 
leachate and 
landfill 
gas 
are 
inadequate. 
E. 
ENVIRONMENTAL 
BENEFITS 
The 
project 
as 
a 
whole 
is 
substantially 
positive 
in 
environmental 
terms, 
with 
the 
benefits 
greatly 
outweighing 
the 
negative 
impacts. 
Collection 
and 
treatment 
of 
the 
remaining 
wastewater 
in 
the urban 
areas 
of 
Shanghai 
(from 
areas 
designated 
"A", 
"B", 
and 
"C") 
will 
reduce 
substantially 
the 
pollution 
loads 
discharged 
to 
the 
lower 
Huangpu 
and thereby 
improve 
water 
quality. 
The diversion 
of 
wastewater away 
from 
the 
Huangpu 
catchment 
for 
treatment  at 
Zhuyuan 
is 
the 
preferred 
solution 
in 
terms 
of 
level 
of 
improvement 
in 
water 
quality 
in 
the Huangpu,  and 
risk 
minimization. 
Moreover 
it 
would not 
result 
in 
deterioration 
of 
water 
quality 
in 
the Yangtze 
River. The 
alternative 
for 
Area 
B 
of 
secondary wastewater 
treatment and discharge 
to 
the 
Huangpu 
was 
rejected 
as 
being 
less 
effective 
in 
terms 
of 
water 
quality 
improvement 
in 
the 
Huangpu 
by 
virtue 
of 
the 
impact 
of 
the 
residual 
pollution load 
associated 
with 
the 
treated 
wastewater, 
particularly 
under 
low flow 
conditions 
in 
the Huangpu. 
In 
addition 
this 
option 
would 
be more costly 
and 
would 
have greater 
engineering 
risks 
in 
both 
construction and 
operation. 
The 
investments 
in 
the 
Upper 
Huangpu 
catchment 
are 
particularly important 
in 
terms 
of 
safeguarding 
water 
quality 
and enabling compliance 
with 
water 
quality 
objectives 
in 
the 
Upper 
Huangpu 
and 
in 
particular 
the 
sustainability 
of 
the 
key 
strategic  water 
supply 
abstraction 
at 
Daqiao. 
The 
proposed 
initiatives 
represent 
the 
beginning 
of 
a 
major 
program 
of 
water 
quality 
improvements 
in 
the 
catchment, 
- 
107 
- 
Page  112
and 
will 
also 
for 
the 
first 
time 
bring 
pollution 
from 
agricultural 
waste 
under 
a 
degree 
of 
control. 
The 
waste management 
component 
would 
improve 
the 
efficiency 
of 
the waste management service and 
would 
reduce 
the 
environmental impact 
of 
landfill 
operations 
at 
Laogang through 
better 
standards 
of 
operation, 
improved control 
and 
management 
of 
leachate 
and 
the 
introduction 
of 
more effective 
controls 
on landfill 
gas. 
The 
landfill 
site 
at 
Laogang 
would 
be 
operated 
to 
international 
standards 
of 
sanitary 
landfills 
and 
would 
form 
part 
of 
an 
overall 
integrated 
waste management 
system 
for 
Shanghai 
involving 
additionally  incineration 
and 
composting. 
The 
improvements 
in 
waste 
collection, 
segregation  and 
recycling 
would 
improve 
the 
flexibility 
and extend 
the 
options 
for 
waste 
treatmenddisposal 
and 
would 
reduce the 
overall 
environmental 
burden 
of 
waste management 
by 
reducing 
the 
quantities 
of 
waste 
that 
require 
transport 
and 
disposal. 
In 
particular 
the proposed 
separate 
collection and 
disposal 
of 
food 
wastes 
will 
avoid 
health-related 
concerns 
in 
respect 
of 
the present 
practice 
of 
use 
of 
food 
waste 
for 
animal 
feed. 
F. 
POTENTIAL 
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS 
AND 
THEIR 
MITIGATION 
MEASURES 
Although 
the 
balance 
of 
the 
project 
in 
environmental 
terms 
is 
substantially positive, 
nevertheless 
some 
negative 
impacts 
have 
been 
identified 
in 
the 
EA 
process 
for 
all 
components, 
and 
these 
require 
mitigation 
measures. 
The 
principal 
impacts 
and their 
appropriate 
mitigation 
measures 
are 
described 
below. 
Sludge 
Production. 
Treatment 
of 
wastewater 
at 
the 
treatment 
plants  proposed 
would 
generate 
substantial quantities 
of 
sludge. 
The 
aggregate 
quantity 
of 
sludge 
produced 
at the  treatment plants 
in 
Shanghai 
would 
be 
in 
the order 
of 
3,000 
tons 
of 
dewatered sludge 
cake 
per 
day. 
It 
is 
doubtful 
whether 
adequate 
outlets 
exist 
for 
the 
beneficial 
use 
of 
this 
quantity 
of 
sludge 
on 
a sustained 
basis. 
Disposal 
of 
the 
sludge 
would 
therefore have 
to 
be, at 
least 
in 
part, 
by 
landfill, 
and 
environmentally 
secure 
landfill 
facilities 
would 
be 
provided 
where 
these 
do not 
already exist. 
A 
comprehensive sludge 
management 
plan 
is 
under 
preparation 
as 
a component 
of 
the 
overall 
Wastewater 
Master 
Plan 
for 
Shanghai 
Municipality. 
The 
APLl 
component 
of 
Urban 
Wastewater  Management 
has 
a 
provision 
for 
sludge 
treatment 
and 
disposal. 
Dispersion 
of 
Wastewater 
Discharges. 
The 
degree 
of 
wastewater 
treatment 
has 
yet 
to 
be finalized, 
but 
regardless 
of 
the 
level 
of 
treatment 
afforded 
to 
wastewater, 
there 
may 
be 
a 
zone 
close 
to 
the 
point 
of 
discharge 
where there 
is 
significant 
impact 
upon 
local 
water 
quality 
and 
local 
water 
quality 
objectives 
cannot 
be 
met. 
Initial 
water 
quality modeling 
carried out 
to 
predict 
the 
impact 
of 
discharges 
at 
Zhuyuan 
indicated 
that 
chemically 
enhanced 
primary 
treatment 
of 
both 
SSPl 
and 
APLl 
discharges 
at Zhuyuan 
would 
result 
in 
a 
very 
small 
mixing 
zone 
of 
area 
0.6 
km2, 
in 
which 
water 
quality 
would 
be 
no 
worse 
than 
Category 
IIt. 
In 
the 
case 
of 
secondary 
treatment 
for 
both 
discharges there 
would 
be 
no 
deterioration 
in 
water 
quality 
below 
Category 
II. 
To 
maximize 
the 
initial 
dispersion 
of 
the wastewater  discharges, 
and thereby 
minimize 
the 
area 
of 
the 
so-called 
mixing 
zone 
required 
for 
water 
quality to return 
to 
background 
levels, 
the 
treated 
wastewater 
would 
be discharged 
through 
efficient 
diffuser 
systems. 
The 
detailed 
configuration 
of 
these 
diffuser 
systems 
would 
be 
designed 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
mathematical dispersion 
and 
water 
quality 
modeling. 
The 
environmental 
investments proposed 
(principally 
in 
wastewater and 
solid 
waste 
collection, 
treatment 
and 
safe 
disposal), 
would 
have 
significant 
though 
indirect 
benefits 
to 
public 
health 
and 
hygiene, 
and 
are 
vital 
inputs 
to 
health 
risk 
mitigation. 
These 
far-reaching 
and 
long-term 
benefits 
would 
contribute 
to 
urban efficiency, 
economic 
growth, 
public 
dynamism 
and 
creativity.

Impact 
of 
Landfill. 
Increases 
in 
the 
operational 
area 
and the quantities 
of 
waste 
disposed 
of 
at 
Laogang 
will 
exacerbate the 
key 
environmental 
impacts 
of 
landfill, 
namely 
leachate 
and 
landfill 
gas. 
The 
project 
will 
include 
enhanced 
controls 
on 
the 
generation 
of 
leachate 
and 
more effective 
treatment 
and  the 
effective 
collection 
and 
safe 
management 
of 
landfill 
gas. 
Depending 
upon 
the 
overall 
level 
of 
gas 
generation 
it 
is 
expected that 
gas 
will 
be 
exploited 
for 
beneficial 
use. 
The  overall 
burden 
of 
waste 
management 
in 
terms 
both 
of 
transport and disposal 
would be 
reduced 
by 
proposed 
initiatives 
for 
waste 
minimization 
and 
treatmendrecycling.

Construction Spoil. 
Substantial  quantities 
of 
spoil 
would 
be 
generated 
as 
a 
result 
of 
excavation 
for 
pipeline installation 
and 
for 
the 
construction 
of 
wastewater 
treatment plants. 
Most 
of 
the 
material 
would 
be 
reused 
on 
site, 
and 
spoil 
disposal 
plans have 
been prepared 
for 
each 
project 
component where 
excess 
spoil 
would 
be 
generated. 
It 
is 
expected 
that 
all 
spoil 
would 
be 
beneficially 
used 
in 
other 
local 
construction 
activities 
and therefore 
spoil 
disposal 
would not 
be 
problematic.

Other 
Construction Impacts. 
Other 
impacts 
of 
construction 
include 
noise 
from 
construction 
machinery, 
generation 
of 
dust 
and 
disruption 
of 
local 
traffic. 
These 
would 
be minimized 
by 
appropriate 
restrictions 
on 
working 
hours and 
the 
operational 
procedures 
of 
the 
contractors concemed. 
Other Operational 
Impacts. 
The 
other 
significant 
potential 
impacts 
of 
the  operation 
of 
wastewater 
treatment plants and 
pumping 
stations 
are 
noise 
and, 
in 
the 
case 
of 
wastewater 
treatment plants, 
odor. 
These 
would 
be minimized 
by 
the 
careful 
siting 
of 
the 
facilities 
and 
by 
the 
provision 
of 
buffer 
zones 
and 
landscaping 
as 
appropriate. 
Where 
there 
are 
sensitive noise receptors 
close 
to 
the 
facilities, 
the 
noise 
emissions 
would 
be minimized 
by 
appropriate 
acoustic 
insulation 
of 
machinery.

CHINA: Shanghai Urban Environment Project 
Project 
Description 
1. 
The 
proposed Adaptable 
Program 
Loan 
(APL)  project 
consists 
of 
three 
phases. 
APLl 
includes 
the 
construction 
of 
one wastewater treatment 
plant 
and 
collection 
system 
for 
the 
urban 
core 
currently 
not 
served, 
development 
of 
a 
solid 
waste 
disposal 
site, 
urban planning 
and 
pilot 
upgrading, 
and 
Upper 
Huangpu 
catchment 
environmental 
management, 
including 
the 
development 
of 
wastewater 
collection 
and 
treatment 
systems 
in 
the upper 
catchment. 
Five 
resettlement 
action 
plans 
(RAP) 
have been prepared 
for 
APLl 
and 
one 
resettlement 
policy 
framework 
has 
been 
developed 
to 
guide 
resettlement 
planning 
for 
the 
urban 
upgrading 
component 
in 
APLl 
and 
project 
proposals 
in 
APL 
2 
and 
3. 
Resettlement 
Planning 
2. 
The 
Shanghai 
Water 
Authority 
(SWA),  through 
SWEC, 
was 
responsible 
for 
the  resettlement 
planning 
of 
APLl 
and organized 
different 
teams 
to 
carry  out 
the  assignment. 
Resettlement 
planning 
included 
detailed 
census 
of 
affected 
people, 
inventory 
of 
impacts 
and 
socioeconomic 
surveys.  These 
resettlement 
planning 
activities 
provide 
a 
detailed 
record 
of 
adverse 
project 
impacts, 
including 
land, 
houses, 
businesses, 
institutions, 
and 
the 
number 
of 
people 
affected.  Socioeconomic 
surveys 
were 
conducted through 
questionnaires, 
interviews 
and focus 
group 
discussions 
as 
part 
of 
the resettlement 
planning 
process.

on 
Involuntary 
Resettlement. 
The 
following 
basic 
principles 
were 
adopted 
for 
resettlement 
planning: 
The 
RAP 
was 
prepared 
in 
line with 
relevant 
Chinese laws, 
regulations 
and 
World 
Bank

Compensation 
will 
be 
paid 
at 
replacement 
cost 
without 
depreciation: 
Land 
compensation 
will 
be 
paid 
before acquisition 
; 
House 
compensation 
will 
be 
paid 
before construction 
of 
the 
new 
house: 
Compensation 
rates 
must 
be 
finalized 
through 
consultation: 
Lack 
of 
legal 
title 
will 
not 
bar 
an 
affected 
person 
from 
his 
or 
her 
resettlement entitlements: 
and 
The 
objective 
of 
resettlement 
is 
to 
enable 
the 
affected 
persons 
to 
improve 
or 
at least restore 
their 
living 
standard. 
Rehabilitation 
Strategy 
and 
Measures 
5. 
Three 
components 
would 
require acquisition 
of 
farm 
land. 
For 
farmers 
who 
lose 
farm 
land, the 
livelihood 
rehabilitation 
strategy 
follows 
the 
traditional 
Chinese 
approach, 
which 
is 
land- 
and 
agnculture-based, 
and 
depends 
on 
village 
collectives for 
livelihood 
restoration. 
All 
affected 
farmers 
would 
be allocated 
farm 
land 
within 
the 
village 
and 
the 
land 
compensation 
fund 
would 
be 
paid 
to 
the 
village 
and 
used 
collectively 
in 
the 
villages 
for 
agriculture and sideline 
development. 
6. 
About 
3,452 
people 
in 
1,228 
households 
would 
lose 
their 
residential 
houses  due 
to 
project 
activities. 
The 
majority 
of 
these 
households 
are 
urban 
residents. 
After 
extensive consultations 
with 
the 
affected  population, 
the 
project 
has 
planned 
to 
offer 
two 
options 
for 
their 
relocation, 
Le., 
cash 
compensation 
and 
replacement  housing. 
Urban 
residents 
could 
choose 
to 
find 
and 
buy 
their 
own 
replacement 
housing 
with 
the cash 
compensation. 
For 
those 
who 
do not 
want 
to 
find 
and 
buy 
their 
own 
replacement  housing, 
the 
project 
would 
provide 
ownership 
of 
a  replacement 
housing 
unit 
in 
government-built 
apartments. 
For 
relocating 
rural 
residents, 
the 
project 
would 
provide 
compensation at 
replacement 
cost 
with no 
depreciation. 
7. 
A 
total 
of 
80 
business enterprises 
would 
be 
affected. 
Most 
of 
them 
would 
be 
affected 
temporarily 
during 
the 
construction 
period 
and 
would 
resume 
business 
after construction. Compensation 
for 
business 
loss 
has 
been 
provided 
for 
in 
the 
RAPs. 
A 
few 
government 
agencies 
would 
require relocation 
and 
new 
sites  have 
been 
planned 
for 
them. 
The 
project 
would 
also 
impact 
some 
public 
infrastructure. 
Compensation 
based 
on 
replacement value 
would 
be 
paid to 
the 
relevant government 
agencies 
or 
local 
governments 
to 
restore 
the 
affected infrastructure and 
services. 
Management Organization 
8. 
A 
multilevel 
organization 
has 
been  established 
for 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
RAPs. 
This 
organization 
includes the 
Project 
Resettlement 
Office, 
and 
project 
offices 
in 
the 
drainage 
companies. 
An 
independent 
monitor 
has 
been 
selected 
for 
resettlement 
implementation. 
Details 
of 
staffing 
and 
their 
responsibilities 
are 
provided 
in 
the 
RAPs. 
Public 
Consultation 
And 
Participation 
9. 
Public 
consultation and 
participation 
have 
played 
a 
key 
role 
in 
formulating 
the 
RAPs. 
The 
affected 
residents, 
business 
people and 
district 
governments 
participated 
in 
the 
census, 
inventory 
and 
formulation 
of 
the 
livelihood 
rehabilitation 
strategy,  measures 
and 
relocation 
sites. 
Their 
feedback 
has 
- 
116 
- 
Page  121
been 
incorporated 
in 
the 
RAPs. 
The 
RAP 
contains 
a 
list 
of 
major 
consultation 
sessions. 
10. 
Public 
consultation 
and 
participation 
would 
continue 
during 
the 
RAP 
implementation. Project 
information 
would 
be 
provided to 
the 
affected 
people 
through television, 
radio 
broadcast, newspapers, 
bulletins 
and 
posters. 
The 
RAP 
would 
be 
summarized 
into 
a resettlement 
information 
booklet 
(RIB) and 
distributed 
to 
every 
affected 
household. 
Regular 
consultation 
meetings 
would 
be 
held 
in 
the 
neighborhoods. 
Grievance 
Redressal 
Mechanism 
11. 
A 
mechanism 
has 
been designed 
for 
gnevance 
redressal 
under 
each 
of 
the 
project 
components. 
All 
gnevances 
can 
be 
filed 
in 
either 
written or 
verbal 
form. The 
redressal channel 
lies 
within 
the 
project 
management 
and 
government 
systems. 
Recording 
requirements and 
timeframe 
have 
been 
established 
for 
grievance 
resolution. 
This 
mechanism 
would 
be 
disclosed 
as 
part 
of 
the 
RIB. 
Resettlement 
Implementation 
Monitoring 
12. 
Internal 
and  external 
monitoring 
have 
been  designed 
as 
part 
of 
the 
project 
resettlement 
management. 
The 
project 
resettlement 
offices 
would 
carry out 
internal 
monitoring 
of 
the 
resettlement 
implementation. 
The monitoring 
procedures,  content, 
staffing, 
responsibility,  timeframe  and 
reporting 
have 
been 
detailed 
in 
the 
RAPS. 
An 
external 
monitor 
has 
been 
contracted 
for 
independent 
monitoring 
of 
the 
RAP 
implementation. 
Independent 
monitoring 
would 
cover 
physical 
progress 
of 
RAP 
implementation, 
including 
compensation 
payment, 
allocation 
of 
residential 
sites, 
farmland 
allocation, and 
restoration 
of 
infrastructure. 
The 
independent 
monitor 
would 
also 
review 
the 
public 
consultation 
process, 
operation 
of 
the 
resettlement 
project 
offices, 
grievance  redressal  mechanisms 
and  restoration 
of 
livelihood 
of 
the 
affected 
farmers. 
Independent 
monitoring 
would 
be conducted 
twice 
a 
year 
during 
the 
project 
implementation period. 
Compensation 
And 
Resettlement 
Budget 
13. 
The RAPs 
contain 
compensation 
rates 
for 
various impacts. 
Land 
compensation 
rates 
included 
a 
land 
compensation  and  resettlement 
subsidy. 
Compensation 
rates 
for 
structures 
are 
calculated 
for 
replacement 
costs. 
The 
affected  infrastructure 
would 
be 
compensated 
for 
reconstruction 
and 
the 
compensation budget 
was 
finalized 
through negotiation 
with 
the 
owning 
government 
agencies. 
14. 
The  RAPs 
contain 
a 
detailed 
resettlement 
budget 
that  covers 
all 
basic  resettlement 
costs, 
management 
costs, 
contingencies, 
survey, 
design 
and 
monitoring 
costs. 
The 
basic  resettlement 
cost 
includes  compensation 
for 
land, 
house, 
other 
structures, 
standing crops 
and 
trees, 
business 
profit 
loss, 
reconstruction 
of 
affected infrastructure and 
relocation 
subsidies. 
A 
management cost 
is 
included 
in 
the 
budget 
as 
well. The 
land 
acquisition 
and resettlement 
costs 
are 
estimated 
to 
have 
a 
base 
cost 
of 
at 
Y538.5 
million, 
equivalent 
to 
$64.9 
million. 
Resettlement 
funds 
would 
be 
financed 
through 
counterpart 
funds. 
Fund 
disbursement 
procedures and 
monitoring 
mechanisms have been designed 
and 
documented 
in 
the 
RAPS.

Project 
Financial Management 
System 
CHINA: 
Shanghai 
Urban 
Environment Project 
Executive 
Summary 
and 
Conclusion 
1. 
The 
task 
team 
has 
conducted 
an 
assessment 
of 
the adequacy 
of 
the 
project 
financial 
management 
system 
of 
the Shanghai 
Urban 
Environment Project. 
The 
assessment, 
based 
on 
guidelines  issued 
by 
the 
Financial 
Management 
Sector 
Board 
on 
June 
30, 
2001, 
has 
concluded 
that 
the 
project 
meets 
minimum 
Bank 
financial 
management requirements, 
as 
stipulated 
in 
BP/OP 
10.02. 
In 
the 
team’s 
opinion, 
the 
project 
will 
have 
in 
place 
an 
adequate 
project 
financial 
management 
system that  can 
provide, 
with 
reasonable 
assurance, 
accurate and 
timely 
information 
on 
the 
status 
of 
the 
project 
in 
the 
reporting 
format 
agreed 
with 
the 
project 
and 
as 
required 
by 
the 
Bank. 
2. 
Funding 
sources 
for 
the 
project 
include 
the 
Bank 
loan 
and counterpart 
funds. 
The Bank 
loan 
proceeds 
would 
flow from 
the 
Bank 
into 
the 
project 
special 
account 
to 
be 
set 
up 
at 
and 
managed 
by 
the 
Shanghai 
Finance Bureau 
(SFB), 
to project implementing 
agencies 
(or 
project 
companies), 
and 
finally to 
contractors 
or 
suppliers. 
The Bank loan 
would 
be signed 
by 
the 
Bank 
and the 
People’s 
Republic 
of 
China 
through 
its 
Ministry 
of 
Finance (MOF), 
and 
onlending 
arrangements 
for 
the 
Bank loan 
would 
be signed 
between the 
People’s 
Republic 
of 
China 
through 
its 
MOF 
and Shanghai 
Municipality 
through 
its 
SFB 
and 
then 
between 
SFB 
and the 
implementing 
agencies. 
In 
terms 
of 
disbursement 
technique,  the 
project 
would 
be 
disbursing 
based 
on 
traditional 
disbursement  techniques 
and 
would 
not  be 
using 
project 
management 
report 
(PMR)-based 
disbursements, 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
agreement 
between 
the 
Bank 
and 
MOF. 
The 
counterpart 
funds 
would 
be 
raised 
and contributed 
on 
behalf 
of 
the Shanghai 
Municipal 
Government 
to 
the 
project 
by 
urban 
development and 
investment 
companies 
at 
the 
municipal 
and 
district 
levels. 
3. 
No 
outstanding 
audits 
or 
audit 
issues 
exist 
with 
any 
of 
the 
implementing 
agencies 
involved 
in 
the 
proposed 
project. 
The 
task 
team, 
however, 
would 
continue 
to 
be  attentive 
to 
financial 
management 
matters 
and audit 
covenants 
during 
project 
supervision.

has 
been 
performed 
for 
China, 
though 
dialogue 
with 
the 
Government 
of 
China 
in 
respect 
of 
the 
CFAA 
exercise 
has 
been 
initiated 
and 
is 
currently 
underway. 
No 
CFAA 
would 
be carried out 
in 
FY03, 
and 
the 
Bank 
has 
relied 
on 
a 
similar 
exercise 
carried 
out 
by 
the 
Asian 
Development 
Bank 
in 
2000 
for 
reference.

However, 
based 
on 
observations 
of 
developments 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
public 
expenditures, accounting 
and 
auditing,  and 
Bank 
experience 
with 
China 
projects 
for 
the past 
few 
years, 
it 
is 
noted 
that substantial 
achievement 
in 
the 
aforementioned 
areas 
has 
been 
made 
and 
further improvement 
is 
expected 
in 
the 
next 
few 
years. 
As 
the 
economic 
reform 
program 
further  unfolds, 
the 
Government 
of 
China 
has 
come 
to 
realize 
the 
importance 
of 
establishing and 
maintaining 
an 
efficient 
and 
effective 
market mechanism 
to 
ensure transparency 
and 
accountability, and 
minimize 
potential fraud 
or 
corruption. 
10. 
Due 
to 
a 
unique 
arrangement 
by 
the 
Government 
of 
China, 
funding 
(in 
particular 
Bank 
loans) 
of 
Bank 
projects 
is 
controlled 
and 
monitored 
by 
MOF 
and 
its 
extension,  i.e. 
finance 
bureaus 
at 
the 
provincial, 
municipal/prefecture and 
county 
levels. 
However, project activities 
are 
usually carried 
out 
by 
implementing 
agencies 
of 
a 
specific 
industry 
or 
sector  due 
to 
the 
level 
and 
complexity 
of 
expertise 
involved. The 
above arrangement 
usually 
requires 
more 
and closer 
coordination 
on 
the 
project, 
as 
the 
multilevel 
management 
of 
the 
funding 
and 
implementation 
mechanism 
sometimes 
works 
to 
the 
detriment 
of 
smooth 
project 
implementation.

of 
the

is 
one 
of 
the 
factors 
critical 
to

Based 
on 
discussions, 
observation  and 
review 
of

and 
work 
experience 
of 
the 
staff 
identified 
for

note 
that 
the

are 
qualified 
and 
appropriate 
to 
the 
work 
they 
are

19. 
To 
strengthen the 
financial 
management 
capacity 
and 
achieve 
consistent 
quality 
of 
accounting 
work, 
the 
task 
term 
has 
suggested 
that a 
project financial 
management 
manual 
(Manual) be 
prepared. 
The 
manual 
would 
provide 
detailed 
guidelines 
on 
financial 
management, 
internal 
controls, 
accounting 
procedures, 
fund 
and 
asset 
management 
and 
withdrawal 
application 
procedures. 
The 
financial 
management 
manual 
has 
been prepared and 
found 
acceptable. 
It 
would 
be 
made 
available 
to 
all 
relevant 
project staff 
before 
project 
effectiveness. 
20. 
As 
most 
implementing 
entities 
are 
new 
to 
the 
Bank’s 
projects,  a 
well-designed  and 
focused 
training program 
in 
project 
financial

would 
be 
provided 
prior to 
project 
effectiveness 
by

State-owned, 
Infrastructure Oriented 
Projects 
(the 
“Standards”), 
taking 
into 
consideration 
the 
unique 
characteristics 
of 
Bank 
projects. 
The 
Standards 
are 
modeled after 
the 
principles 
of 
International Accounting 
Standards 
and 
provides detailed guidelines 
to 
accounting 
for 
activities 
of 
Bank 
financed 
projects. 
23. 
Each 
of 
the 
implementing 
entities 
would 
be 
managing, 
monitoring 
and 
maintaining 
respective 
project 
accounting 
records. 
Original 
supporting 
documents 
for 
project 
activities 
would 
be 
retained 
by 
originating  implementing 
entity. 
In 
addition, 
each 
implementing  entity 
would 
prepare 
financial 
statements, 
which 
would 
then 
be 
reviewed,  approved 
and consolidated 
by 
the 
PO 
before 
submission 
to 
the 
Bank 
for 
review 
and 
comment 
on 
a 
regular 
basis. 
Internal 
Audit 
24. 
There 
is 
no 
formal

by 
SFB 
and

task 
team 
would 
be 
relied 
upon 
to 
provide 
part 
of 
the 
internal 
audit 
functions. 
External 
Audit 
25. 
The 
Bank 
requires  that 
project  financial 
statements 
be 
audited 
in 
accordance 
with 
standards 
acceptable 
to 
the 
Bank. 
In 
line 
with 
other 
Bank-financed projects 
in 
China, 
the 
project 
would 
be 
audited 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
Government 
Auditing 
Standards 
of 
the People’s

Plan 
38. 
As 
there 
are 
a 
number 
of 
implementing 
agencies 
involved 
in 
the 
project, supervision 
coverage 
for 
each 
mission 
is 
expected 
to 
be 
limited 
and therefore 
rotational 
basis 
should 
be 
adopted. 
Furthermore, 
to 
maximize 
effectiveness  and 
efficiency, 
procurement  and 
financial 
management 
and 
disbursement 
specialists 
should 
jointly 
participate 
in 
supervision missions 
for 
procurement and 
SOEs 
reviews. 
During 
the 
initial 
implementation 
stage, 
more 
supervision missions 
(initially twice 
a 
year) 
should be carried out 
to 
have 
better 
coverage and 
ensure 
that procurement guidelines 
are 
followed 
and expenditures 
incurred 
are 
eligible 
and 
well 
supported. 
More 
detailed reviews 
at 
the 
initial 
implementation 
phase can also 
help 
ensure 
that 
the 
financial 
management 
system 
is 
properly 
set 
up 
and 
financial 
statements 
are 
prepared 
in 
line 
with 
stipulated 
format 
and content. 
The 
mission 
frequency 
can then 
be 
subsequently 
reduced 
to 
a 
normal 
level.

Additional 
Annex 
15: 
Financial Policy Objectives and 
Financial Innovations 
CHINA: Shanghai Urban Environment Project 
Introduction 
1. 
The 
financing 
components 
of 
the 
APL 
are 
designed 
to 
support 
the 
overall 
APL 
policy 
vision, 
while 
at 
the 
same 
time 
moving forward 
the 
national 
agenda 
for 
financial 
sector 
reform 
as 
applied 
to 
the 
municipal 
sector. 
Four 
objectives 
have been 
identified 
for 
the 
financial initiatives: 
0 
To 
develop 
long-term, 
stable 
sources 
of 
financing 
for 
Shanghai’s 
environmental  infrastructure 
investments. 
0 
To 
reflect 
the 
environmental connection 
between 
Shanghai’s 
districts 
and 
the 
core 
city 
by 
using 
the 
municipality’s 
financial 
strength 
to 
help 
districts 
gain 
access 
to 
long-term 
financing 
for 
environmental infrastructure. 
0 
To 
have 
Shanghai 
take the 
lead 
among 
municipal 
governments 
in 
applying to 
the 
municipal 
sector 
the 
financial 
sector 
reform 
agenda 
identified 
at 
the 
national 
level, 
including 
building 
direct 
access 
to 
the 
capital 
market 
for 
municipal 
enterprise 
bond 
issues, 
and 
establishing 
higher 
standards 
of 
disclosure 
and 
transparency 
in 
capital 
financing. 
0 
To 
strengthen the 
financial 
management 
capacity 
of 
Shanghai’s 
municipal 
agencies 
responsible 
for 
planning 
and 
financing 
environmental infrastructure 
investments. 
2. 
During 
the appraisal 
process, 
the Shanghai 
Municipal 
Government (SMG) 
and the 
Bank 
agreed 
that 
these 
policies 
could 
most 
effectively 
be 
achieved 
through 
two 
specific 
financial 
innovations: 
the 
introduction 
of 
a 
program 
of 
municipal 
enterprise 
bond 
issuance 
to 
help 
pay 
for 
environmental 
investments 
through 
long-term 
bond 
financing, 
and the establishment 
of 
a 
District Financing 
Vehicle 
which 
would 
help 
district 
governments 
raise 
long-term financing 
to 
carry out 
high-priority 
environmental 
investments 
in 
the 
districts. 
Magnitude 
of 
Shanghai’s 
Financing 
Challenge 
3. 
Shanghai 
officials 
estimate 
that 
over 
the 
next 
five 
years 
they 
would 
have 
to 
finance 
approximately 
Y40 
billion 
(or 
$4.85 
billion) 
in 
the 
water 
and 
wastewater  sector  alone, 
in 
projects 
covering 
water supply, 
wastewater 
collection 
and 
treatment, 
and drainage and containment. 
Both 
national 
and Shanghai 
municipal 
policy call for 
strictly 
limiting 
the amount 
of 
capital 
investment financed 
from 
the 
State 
and 
municipal 
budgets 
in 
the 
form 
of 
contributed 
equity. 
Funding 
from 
this 
source 
is 
estimated 
at 
only 
Y6 
billion. 
Multilateral 
and 
international 
donor 
agencies 
would 
provide 
loan 
funds 
to 
cover 
a 
small 
part 
of 
the 
remaining financing 
gap. 
However, 
the 
great 
bulk 
of 
financing 
would 
have 
to 
be raised 
from 
domestic 
nonstate sources 
or 
the 
international private capital 
market. 
4. 
In 
broad 
terms, Shanghai 
is 
committed to raising 
nonstate 
capital financing 
for 
the 
environmental 
sector 
through 
four 
basic 
strategies. 
Each 
of 
these 
strategies 
seeks 
to 
generate 
longer-term financing. 
The 
strategies 
include: 
Attracting 
equity 
investments, 
from 
both 
domestic 
and international 
investors, 
to 
finance 
new capital 
projects 
like 
wastewater treatment 
plants and 
water 
supply 
systems.

Generating 
capital to help 
finance 
new 
environmental 
projects 
through 
the 
sale 
of 
existing 
assets 
in 
the 
environmental 
sector. 
Borrowing 
from 
domestic 
commercial and 
development 
banks. 
Bank 
loans 
are 
presently 
the standard 
way 
for 
local 
government entities 
to 
access 
the 
credit 
market. 
However, 
the 
maturity 
of 
bank 
loans 
would 
have 
to 
be 
extended considerably 
if 
they 
are 
to 
serve 
as 
a 
stable  source 
of 
financing 
for 
long-term 
investments. 
0 
Accessing 
the 
domestic 
capital 
market 
directly 
through 
the issuance 
of 
longer-term 
bonds. 
5. 
All 
of 
these 
financing 
options 
would 
be 
pursued 
by 
Shanghai 
during 
the 
APL 
and 
are 
consistent 
with 
APL 
policy 
objectives. 
The 
magnitude 
of 
financing 
that 
has 
to 
be raised 
makes 
it 
necessary 
to 
pursue 
all 
possible 
avenues 
of 
efficient 
access 
to 
financial 
markets--from 
equity 
investments 
to 
intermediated 
borrowing 
from 
banks 
to 
direct 
borrowing 
from 
the 
capital 
market 
via bond 
issues. 
The 
use 
of 
multiple 
channels 
for 
accessing 
capital 
should 
encourage 
competition 
across the subsectors, 
helping to 
drive 
down 
the 
long-term 
costs 
of 
capital 
to 
Shanghai. 
6. 
The 
principal 
counterpart 
institution 
for 
the 
APL’s 
wastewater 
investment 
program would 
be 
the 
Shanghai 
Water 
Assets 
Operation 
and 
Development 
Company 
(SWAOD). 
This 
company 
faces  an 
immediate 
financing 
challenge 
to 
meet 
its 
counterpart 
financing 
obligations and 
to 
finance 
the rest 
of 
its 
capital 
budget. 
SWAOD 
estimates 
that 
it 
would 
need 
to 
generate 
Y3.5 
billion 
in 
new 
domestic 
financing 
over 
the 
next 
three 
years 
just 
to 
meet 
its 
counterpart 
financing 
obligations 
to 
the 
World 
Bank 
under 
SSP2 
and 
the 
APL. 
It 
would 
also 
have 
to 
refinance 
Y2.3 
billion 
of 
existing 
debt. 
Present 
Credit 
Mechanisms 
and 
the 
Need 
for Longer-Term Borrowing 
7. 
At 
present, 
credits 
for 
local-level 
infrastructure 
investment 
are 
provided 
primarily 
by 
commercial 
banks 
in 
the 
form 
of 
three- 
to 
five-year 
loans. 
Most 
loans 
carry 
three-year 
maturities. 
The 
use 
of 
short-term 
loans 
to 
finance 
long-term 
investment 
projects 
has 
several 
disadvantages 
and 
creates 
significant financial 
risks. 
8. 
First, 
local-level borrowers generally 
are 
not 
in 
position 
to 
repay 
loans 
of 
this 
type 
on 
schedule. 
Major 
infrastructure projects 
may 
require 
two 
years 
to 
complete, 
with 
the 
result 
that 
a 
project 
has 
very 
little 
revenue-generating  experience 
before 
the 
entire 
loan 
repayment 
becomes  due. 
In 
practice, 
municipalities investing 
in 
long-term 
environmental projects 
generally 
are 
unable 
to 
repay 
the 
principal 
on 
their short-term 
loans, 
and have resorted 
to 
rolling 
over short-term 
debt. 
This 
makes 
them 
vulnerable 
to 
any 
changes 
in 
policy 
or 
extemal 
circumstances that 
could 
interfere 
with rolling 
over 
future 
loans. 
An 
economic 
slowdown 
or 
a 
surge 
in 
local-level 
debt 
could 
make 
banks 
unwilling 
to 
continue 
to 
roll 
over 
short-term 
loans, 
precipitating 
a 
financial crisis 
in 
the 
municipal 
sector. 
9. 
Second, 
from 
the 
perspective 
of 
the 
banking 
sector, 
China 
as 
part 
of 
World 
Trade Organization 
(WTO) 
entry 
has 
embarked 
on 
a 
policy 
of 
cleaning 
up 
the 
banlung 
sector, 
which 
is 
now 
burdened 
by 
a 
very 
high 
rate 
of 
nonperforming 
loans. 
If 
new 
policies 
are 
introduced 
to 
prohibit 
banks 
from 
making 
loans 
that cannot 
be 
repaid 
according 
to 
the 
literal 
terms 
of 
the 
lending 
agreement, 
the 
practice 
of 
rolling 
over short-term 
loans 
to 
finance 
long-term 
investments, 
would 
be greatly curtailed. 
The 
present 
financing 
system 
thus 
is 
vulnerable 
to 
banking 
sector 
reform, 
as 
well. 
In 
fact, 
the 
existence 
of 
large 
amounts 
of 
outstanding  short-term 
bank 
loans 
to municipal-level 
entities, 
whose 
principal 
cannot 
be 
repaid when 
nominally 
due, has 
become 
one 
of 
numerous 
obstacles 
to 
thorough banking-sector 
reform. 
10. 
Third, 
financing 
infrastructure  investment through  short-term 
borrowing 
severs 
the 
economic 
- 
128 
- 
Page  133
link 
between debt 
repayment and 
tariff 
structure. 
Tariff 
rates cannot 
be 
adjusted 
so 
that 
consumers 
pay 
the 
full 
costs 
of 
debt service when 
loans 
are 
for 
a 
three- 
to 
five-year 
period, 
much 
of 
which 
is 
spent 
in 
project  construction. 
To 
obtain 
the 
efficiency 
advantages 
of 
full 
cost 
recovery  through  tariffs, 
the 
borrowing period 
has 
to 
be 
stretched 
out. 
Ideally, 
the 
borrowing period 
should 
roughly 
coincide 
with 
the 
useful 
life 
of 
the infrastructure, 
so 
that 
users 
of 
different 
generations 
contribute 
proportionately 
to 
the 
costs 
of 
construction 
and depreciation. 
11. 
All 
of 
the 
financing 
strategies 
identified 
in 
the 
previous 
section 
potentially 
can 
provide 
access 
to 
longer-term  financing. 
In 
fact, 
some 
movement 
in 
this 
direction 
already 
has 
occurred. 
The 
China 
Development 
Bank 
(CDB) 
is 
now 
making 
longer-term 
loans 
to 
local 
government entities 
for 
projects 
of 
national importance. 
One 
of 
the 
districts 
in 
the Shanghai 
periphery recently received 
a 
10-year 
loan 
from 
CDB 
to 
finance  infrastructure 
associated 
with 
a 
new 
port 
and  associated 
new 
town. 
In 
the  team’s 
meetings 
with 
commercial 
banks, the banks 
indicated 
a 
willingness 
in 
principle 
to 
extend 
loan 
maturities 
for well-prepared infrastructure 
investment projects, especially 
if 
these 
had 
been 
reviewed 
and 
approved 
by 
the 
World 
Bank.. 
The 
Shanghai 
Urban 
Development 
Investment 
Corporation 
(UDIC) 
has 
issued 
bonds 
to help 
finance infrastructure 
investments, 
primarily 
in 
the 
transportation 
sector. 
One 
bond 
of 
Y 
1 
billion 
carried 
an 
eight-year 
maturity, 
the 
longest 
maturity 
to 
date. 
12. 
Some 
of 
the 
financing 
strategies 
also 
carry 
special 
risks. 
The 
sale 
of 
environmental 
assets--though 
appropriate 
in 
principle 
when 
funds 
are 
reinvested 
in 
new 
infrastructure 
projects--has 
placed 
a 
financial 
burden 
on 
SWAOD 
in 
practice. 
SWAOD 
is 
divesting 
itself 
of 
potential 
income-generating 
assets, 
while 
the terms 
of 
sale 
require 
SWAOD 
to 
devote a 
significant portion 
of 
its 
capital 
budget 
to 
recurring 
subsidies 
to 
the 
private 
purchaser. 
Financial 
Sector 
Reform 
13. 
China’s 
transition to 
the 
post-WTO 
world 
is 
a 
major 
policy 
theme, 
both 
for 
China’s 
national 
institutions 
and 
for 
international 
policy 
dialogue 
with 
China. 
A 
key 
component 
in 
adjusting 
to 
the 
post-WTO 
world 
is 
reform 
of 
the 
financial 
sector. 
Financial 
sector 
reform 
has 
been 
identified 
as 
a 
high 
priority 
by 
China,  the 
World 
Bank, 
the 
IMF 
and 
other 
international 
institutions. 
China 
has 
committed 
itself 
to 
permitting 
international competition 
within 
the 
banking 
sector 
and throughout 
the 
financial 
sector 
within five 
years 
of 
WTO 
entry. 
This 
timetable 
gives 
extra urgency 
to reform 
of 
domestic 
financial 
institutions 
and 
to 
revamping 
regulatory 
oversight.

Strengthening 
capital 
market 
development. 
At 
present, 
the 
banking 
sector 
dominates 
financial 
activity 
in 
China. 
Almost 
all 
banks 
and other 
financial 
institutions 
are  state-owned. 
The 
capital 
market 
is 
underdeveloped, 
especially 
as 
a 
source 
of 
financing 
for 
corporate 
and 
municipal 
investment 
financing 
(see 
Table

Modernizing 
financial-sector 
regulation. 
At 
present, 
regulation 
typically 
takes 
the 
form 
of 
direct 
control. 
All 
bond 
issues, 
for 
example, 
must 
be 
approved 
on 
a 
case-by-case 
basis 
by 
State 
Development 
& 
Reform 
Commission 
(SDRC) 
and 
other 
national-level institutions. 
Broadening 
the 
scope 
for 
market 
signals 
in 
the 
financial 
sector. 
Financial 
sector 
regulation 
currently 
makes 
relatively 
little 
use 
of 
market 
signals. 
All 
bonds 
are 
issued 
at 
an 
interest 
rate dictated 
by 
the 
People’s 
Bank 
of 
China, 
which 
takes 
into 
account  macroeconomic 
conditions, 
but 
does 
not 
distinguish 
bond 
yields 
by 
credit 
risk 
or allow 
the 
market 
to 
establish interest-rate 
differentials 
to 
reflect 
risk 
at 
the 
time 
of 
bond 
issuance. 
Strengthening 
or 
creating 
long-term 
bond 
markets. 
Only 
in 
the 
last 
year 
has 
the 
national 
government 
begun 
to 
issue 
long-term 
bonds, 
with 
small 
issues 
of 
10, 
15, 
and 
20 
years. 
Establishment 
of 
a 
robust 
risk-free 
yield 
curve should 
encourage the 
rest 
of 
the 
market, 
including 
the 
subnational 
sector, 
to 
begin 
issuance 
of 
longer-term 
debt, 
and 
provide 
a 
basis 
for 
market 
pricing 
of 
this 
debt. 
Increasing 
disclosure  and 
transparency. 
China’s 
financial 
sector 
currently 
operates 
in 
an 
opaque 
manner. 
This 
extends 
both 
to 
the 
overall financial 
position 
of 
key 
institutions 
and 
to 
the 
financial 
backing 
that 
supports 
individual 
loans 
or individual 
bond 
issues. 
Municipal 
enterprise 
bond 
issues 
in 
particular 
are 
bought 
on 
the 
“reputation” 
of 
the 
issuer and 
an 
implied 
guarantee 
that the 
municipality 
would 
not 
let 
the 
issuer 
fail. 
There 
is 
little 
market 
scrutiny 
of 
underlying financial 
conditions, 
and 
little 
information on which 
to 
base 
such 
a 
judgment. 
15. 
The financial 
innovations incorporated 
into 
the Shanghai 
APL 
are 
designed 
to 
help 
establish a 
municipal-level 
bond 
market 
that 
introduces 
the 
most 
important 
elements 
of 
financial 
sector 
reform 
into 
municipal-level 
enterprise 
bonds, 
while 
at 
the 
same 
time 
lengthening 
credit 
maturities. 
The 
APL’s 
financial 
program 
provides 
an 
opportunity 
to 
fit 
subnational 
(“municipal”) 
capital 
financing 
into 
the 
reform 
framework 
being 
pursued 
at 
the 
national 
level. Such 
integration 
is 
critical 
to 
the 
long-term 
success 
of 
local 
financing initiatives. 
Local 
govemment 
capital 
finance 
cannot strengthen 
its 
market orientation 
if 
it 
is 
kept 
as 
a 
separate 
channel 
of 
the 
credit 
market, 
insulated 
from 
competition 
with 
the rest 
of 
the 
financial 
sector.

Issues 
16. 
Discussion 
with 
Shanghai 
counterpart 
institutions 
and 
with 
the 
Bank’s 
financial 
sector 
reform 
team 
has 
identified 
a 
program 
of 
continuing,  long-term 
bond 
issuance 
as 
the 
financial 
innovation 
that 
offers 
the 
best 
opportunity 
for 
combining 
Shanghai’s 
need 
to 
access 
long-term 
capital 
on 
a 
stable, 
continuing 
basis 
with 
the 
financial 
sector 
reform 
objectives 
outlined 
above. 
17. 
A 
municipal-level 
bond 
issue 
in 
itself 
is 
not 
a 
novel 
instrument. 
There 
was 
a 
flurry 
of 
local 
government 
bond 
issuance 
in 
the 
early 
1990s, 
which 
resulted 
in 
a 
number 
of 
subsequent 
defaults 
by 
the 
issuers. 
This 
history 
is 
one reason 
that 
national 
authorities 
established 
the 
strict regulatory 
regime 
now 
in 
place. 
The 
Shanghai 
UDIC 
has 
been 
a 
successful recent issuer. 
It 
has 
issued bonds 
as 
one 
means 
of 
raising capital 
finance, especially 
for 
transportation  projects. 
A 
bond 
issue 
is 
an 
appropriate 
instrument 
for 
introducing 
fundamental 
reforms, 
important 
both 
to 
Shanghai’s 
future  capital  financing 
of 
environmental projects and 
as 
a 
precedent 
for 
municipal-level 
capital 
financing 
elsewhere. 
Key 
reforms 
to 
be incorporated 
in 
a 
local 
bond 
issue 
include: 
Maturities. 
The 
policy 
objective 
is 
to 
move toward 
truly 
long-term 
bond 
issuance. 
However, 
there 
are 
limits 
on 
how 
greatly 
bond 
maturities 
can 
be 
changed 
at 
once. 
As 
noted, Shanghai 
has 
experience 
with 
one 
small 
bond 
issue 
of 
eight-year 
maturity. 
Otherwise, 
all 
bond 
issues 
have been 
for 
five 
years 
or 
less. 
The national 
government 
has 
begun longer-term 
bond 
issuance, 
also 
on 
a 
relatively 
small 
scale, 
only 
in 
the 
last 
few 
years. 
A 
two-step 
process 
therefore 
may be 
necessary, 
in 
which 
the 
Shanghai 
institution 
first 
issues 
a 
bond 
in 
the 
8- 
to 
10-year range, then, 
following 
market 
acceptance, 
moves 
toward 
longer-term 
issuance. 
Accessing 
Long-Term 
Institutional 
Savings. 
A 
bond 
is 
an 
appropriate 
instrument 
for 
tapping 
long-term  institutional 
savings. 
In 
the 
Chinese 
market, 
this 
means 
tapping 
insurance  company 
savings. 
There 
are 
no 
other substantial 
institutional 
investors 
(commercial 
banks are 
prohibited 
from 
purchasing 
bonds; 
pension 
funds 
are 
not 
yet 
significant 
buyers). 
To 
be 
eligible 
for 
insurance 
company 
purchase, 
a 
bond 
must 
be 
approved 
for 
this 
purpose 
by 
the 
Insurance  Regulatory 
Commission 
(IRC). 
The 
IRC 
must 
judge 
the safety 
of 
the bond; 
it 
also 
examines 
whether 
the 
bond 
issue 
is 
sufficiently 
large 
to justify 
institutional 
purchase. 
In 
practice, 
IRC 
responds 
to 
insurance 
companies’ 
requests 
to 
authorize 
purchase 
of 
specific 
bond 
issues. 
Securing 
IRC 
approval 
for 
insurance 
company 
purchase 
of 
Shanghai 
environmental 
bond 
issues 
would 
represent 
a 
major 
breakthrough 
in 
sustainable 
capital financing. 
No 
subnational  government 
bond 
has 
yet 
received 
approval. 
The 
initial 
bond 
issue 
is 
likely 
to 
be 
too 
small 
to 
achieve 
this breakthrough. However, 
it 
should be 
an 
important 
goal 
for 
the 
overall program 
of 
bond 
issuance. 
0 
Liquidity. 
One 
way 
of 
supporting 
long-term 
bond 
issuance 
is 
development 
of 
a 
liquid 
secondary 
market, 
so 
that 
purchasers 
are 
not locked 
into 
holding 
a 
bond 
issue 
for 
its 
entire 
lifetime, 
but 
can 
sell 
the 
bond 
on 
the 
market 
if 
their 
circumstances 
change. 
The 
Shanghai 
Stock Exchange 
lists 
some 
bonds. 
However, 
the 
market 
for 
bond 
trades 
is 
extremely 
thin. 
There 
is 
no 
market-maker 
system. 
Trades 
occur 
very 
infrequently 
and 
in 
small 
volumes. 
Improvement 
of 
the 
bond 
listing 
and 
bond 
trading 
procedures 
is 
a 
policy 
goal 
of 
financial 
sector 
reform. 
Shanghai 
should 
be 
ready 
to 
take 
advantage 
of 
any 
reforms 
that 
strengthen 
the 
secondary 
bond 
market 
in 
China, 
by 
preparing to 
meet 
listing 
requirements. 
Given 
the 
time required 
to 
obtain 
listing 
under current 
rules--estimated 
by 
the 
Stock 
Exchange 
at 
12 
to 
18 
months 
when 
all 
goes 
smoothly-such 
listing 
may 
or  may 
not 
be 
worthwhile 
for 
an 
initial 
bond 
issue, 
depending 
upon 
the 
gains 
in 
liquidity 
that  can 
be 
achieved 
through 
listing.

Disclosure. 
A 
bond 
issue 
can 
be 
a 
very  effective 
device 
for 
increasing 
financial 
disclosure 
and 
transparency, 
two 
goals 
that 
rank 
high 
in 
China’s 
capital  market 
development. 
Past 
Offering 
Statements 
provide 
very 
little 
information 
either 
on 
the 
financial  condition 
of 
the 
issuer, 
the 
investment projects 
that 
bond 
proceeds 
would 
finance, 
or 
the  sources 
of 
funds 
to 
be 
used 
for 
repayment. 
There 
is 
no 
presentation 
of 
the 
issuer’s 
annual 
budgets 
or 
financial 
statements. 
There 
is 
no 
disclosure 
of 
the issuer’s 
balance 
sheet. 
There 
is 
no 
disclosure 
of 
the revenue 
sources 
to 
be 
used 
for 
debt 
servicing or 
the 
connection between 
debt service and 
tariff 
charges. 
Fuller 
disclosure 
would 
help 
greatly 
in 
capital 
market  development 
for 
the 
municipal 
sector 
and 
in 
particular 
in 
moving 
toward 
public 
sector 
project 
financing, 
where 
borrowing 
is 
secured 
solely 
by 
project 
revenues. 
Under 
these 
conditions, 
a 
solid 
understanding 
of 
fully 
disclosed 
project 
revenues 
and 
costs, 
plus 
regulatory 
and other 
risks, 
must 
substitute 
for implicit 
or 
explicit 
guarantees 
as 
security 
for 
the 
bond 
issue. 
Preparation 
of 
Offering 
Statements 
that 
move 
toward 
full 
disclosure and 
lay 
the 
groundwork 
for 
future 
project financing 
is 
a 
priority 
goal 
for 
the 
APL. 
a 
Interest Rate. 
Interest 
rates 
for bond 
issues 
are 
set 
by 
the People’s 
Bank 
of 
China. 
Rates are 
set 
below 
the cost 
of 
bank 
loans, 
thus 
providing 
another 
incentive 
for 
developing 
this 
type 
of 
capital 
market 
access. 
It 
would 
be 
desirable 
to 
have interest 
rates 
set 
by 
the  market, 
and 
this 
is 
a 
policy 
refom 
objective 
at 
the 
national 
level. However, 
a Shanghai-level issue cannot 
be 
expected 
to 
be 
the 
vehicle 
for 
such 
a 
fundamental 
change 
in 
national 
policy. 
Mechanics 
of 
a 
Local Bond 
Issue 
18. 
Bond 
issuance 
in 
China 
is 
highly 
regulated. 
In 
addition 
to 
obtaining 
the 
case-by-case 
approval 
of 
SDRC 
for 
a 
bond 
issue, issuers 
must 
comply 
with 
a 
set 
of 
general regulations. 
As 
these 
pertain 
to 
the 
local 
government 
sector, 
regulations include: 
0 
Municipalities 
(Le., 
municipal 
governments) 
are 
now 
prohibited 
from 
issuing 
bonds 
directly 
or 
guaranteeing the bonds 
of 
others. 
0 
Local 
government 
bonds 
can 
be 
issued 
only 
by 
asset-owning 
companies. 
Local 
government 
institutions 
have been reorganized 
so 
as 
to 
separate 
asset 
ownership and 
asset 
management 
from 
service 
delivery 
functions. 
The 
assets 
serve 
as 
collateral 
for 
bonded 
debt. 
0 
Bonds 
must 
be 
guaranteed 
by 
a 
third-party 
asset-owning 
or 
financial 
enterprise. 
In 
order 
to 
issue 
bonds, an 
institution 
must 
have a 
three-year 
track 
record 
of 
profitable 
operation. 
Cumulative 
outstanding 
bonds cannot 
exceed 
40 
percent 
of 
the 
issuing 
institution’s 
assets. 
0 
Bonds 
cannot 
be 
used 
to

more 
than 
30 
percent 
of 
a 
project’s 
cost. 
Bond-Issuing 
Institution 
and 
Preparation 
for 
Issue 
19. 
SMG 
has 
identified 
SWAOD 
as 
the 
bond 
issuer. 
SWAOD 
is 
a 
municipal 
enterprise 
100 
percent 
owned 
by 
UDIC. 
It 
was 
established 
in 
December 
2000. 
Under 
its 
charter 
SWAOD 
owns 
and 
manages 
water 
and 
wastewater 
assets 
in 
the  core 
city 
and 
is 
responsible 
for 
obtaining  financing 
for  new 
investments 
in 
these 
sectors. 
It 
can also 
invest 
in 
the 
remainder 
of 
the 
municipality, 
either 
directly 
as 
a 
fixed 
asset 
owner, 
or indirectly 
as 
a shareholder 
in 
project 
companies.

SWAOD 
is 
one 
of 
what 
is 
envisioned 
to 
be 
a 
series 
of 
specialized sectoral subsidiaries under 
UDIC. 
When 
SWAOD 
was 
established, 
UDIC 
transferred 
to 
its 
balance 
sheet 
both 
water 
and 
wastewater 
assets 
and 
the corresponding 
financial liabilities. 
SMG 
has 
identified 
SWAOD 
as 
the agency 
responsible 
for 
raising 
the 
counterpart 
funds 
for 
APL 
investments 
in 
wastewater 
collection 
and 
treatment 
in 
the 
core 
city.

The 
World 
Bank 
team 
was 
provided 
with 
SWAOD’s 
financial 
statements 
for 
calendar 
2001 
(income 
and 
cash 
flow 
statements), 
as 
well 
as 
its 
balance 
sheet 
as 
of 
the 
beginning

end 
of 
2001. 
The 
consolidated 
balance 
sheet 
is 
set 
forth 
in 
Table

It 
shows 
that 
as 
of 
year-end 2001, 
SWAOD 
had net 
assets 
(owner’s 
equity) 
of 
approximately Y9.9 
billion. 
This 
is 
sufficient 
coverage 
to 
start 
SWAOD’s 
bond 
issuance 
program. 
Continuation 
of 
the bond-issuance 
program 
over the 
long 
run 
would 
require 
that 
tariff 
policies 
be 
put 
in 
place 
that increase 
SWAOD’s 
retum 
on

for 
its 
first

a net 
profit 
of 
Y253 
million, 
representing a 
retum 
on 
total 
assets 
of 
approximately 
1.3

The 
current regulations 
in 
effect 
for 
enterprise 
bond 
issues 
require 
that 
an 
issuer have a 
three-year 
financial history 
of 
profitable 
operation. 
SWAOD 
therefore 
must 
compile 
two 
additional 
years 
of 
profitable 
operation before 
it 
can 
meet the issuance 
requirement. 
If 
SWAOD 
continues 
to 
be 
profitable, 
it 
would 
complete the 
three-year 
period 
in 
December 
2003, 
with 
audited 
financial 
statements 
confirming 
its 
profitability 
available 
in 
June 
2004. 
Allowing 
time 
for 
formal bond 
issuance 
approvals 
by 
SMG 
and 
SDRC, 
under the 
current 
bond 
issuance 
regulations, 
the 
first 
half 
of 
2005 
represents 
the earliest  target 
date 
by 
which 
SWAOD 
could 
reasonably be expected 
to 
issue 
a bond. 
SWAOD 
intends 
to 
use 
the proceeds 
from 
its 
initial 
bond 
issue 
to 
repay 
short-term 
debt 
used 
as 
construction financing. 
23. 
Consideration 
was 
given 
to 
having 
UDIC 
issue 
the 
first 
bond, 
so 
that 
the 
bond 
issuance 
program 
could 
start 
at 
an 
earlier 
date. 
However, 
UDIC’s 
borrowing 
capacity 
would 
be 
fully 
utilized 
in 
raising 
funds 
for 
investment 
in 
other 
sectors. 
SWAOD 
has 
been 
established 
specifically 
for 
the  purpose 
of 
financing 
and managing 
assets 
in 
the 
water and 
wastewater sectors. 
It 
was 
judged 
to 
be 
desirable 
to 
focus 
on 
strengthening 
SWAOD’s 
financing 
and 
financial 
management 
capacity, 
as 
the 
institution 
that 
would 
-

Page  138
have 
long-term 
responsibility 
for 
this 
aspect 
of 
environmental capital financing. 
24. 
Work 
in 
Phase 
One 
of 
the 
APL 
would 
prepare 
for 
a 
program 
of 
SWAOD 
bond 
issuance, 
as 
part 
of 
an 
overall 
strategy 
of 
long-term capital financing 
of 
SWAOD’s 
budget. 
All 
of 
the general 
financial 
preparation 
for 
bond 
issuance can 
be completed 
in 
Phase 
One, 
as 
well 
preliminary 
design 
of 
the 
initial 
bond 
issue 
and 
testing 
of 
its 
marketability. The 
formal 
approval 
process 
cannot  start 
until 
SWAOD 
actually 
meets 
the 
threshold 
test 
of 
three years 
of 
profitable 
operation. 
Detailed 
design 
of 
the 
first 
bond 
issue 
cannot start 
until 
a 
reasonable 
time 
before 
the 
planned 
issuance 
date, 
since 
the 
design 
would 
depend 
upon 
SWAOD’s 
actual 
financial condition 
at 
the 
time, other 
sources 
of 
long-term capital 
financing, 
the 
tariff 
regime 
that 
has 
been  approved, 
and 
general 
conditions 
in 
the 
economy  and 
bond 
market. 
In 
addition, national-level 
regulations 
concerning 
municipal 
enterprise 
bond 
approvals, 
financial 
disclosure, 
and 
secondary 
market 
operations 
are 
now 
under 
review. 
It 
is 
universally 
expected 
that 
the  current 
regulations,  adopted 
in 
1993, 
would 
be 
substantially 
revised before 
the 
time 
of 
SWAOD’s 
first 
bond 
issue.

In 
China, 
the 
bond 
underwriter 
plays an 
active 
role 
in 
design 
of 
a 
bond 
issue, 
preparation 
of 
the 
Financial 
Management 
Assistance 
to 
SWAOD 
26. 
A 
municipal 
enterprise 
bond 
issue, 
or 
even 
a 
series 
of 
bond 
issues, 
would 
not 
on 
their 
own 
solve 
the 
financing 
challenge 
for 
SWAOD 
or 
for 
the 
wastewater 
environmental 
sector 
in 
Shanghai. 
Credit 
financing 
of 
this 
kind 
must 
be placed 
within 
an 
overall financial 
management strategy 
that 
assures 
the 
capacity 
to 
repay debt and 
adhere 
to 
a 
business 
plan. 
Collaboration 
with 
SWAOD 
during 
APLl 
would 
focus 
on 
building 
up 
the 
financial 
management 
capacity 
of 
this 
new institution, 
while 
preparing 
for 
bond 
issuance 
in 
APL2. 
27. 
The 
flow 
chart, 
entitled 
Bond 
Preparation 
Process, Phase 
1, 
illustrates 
the 
financial 
management 
capacity 
building 
to 
take 
place 
in 
APL1. 
A 
Financial  Advisory 
team, 
consisting 
of 
domestic  and 
international 
experts, 
would 
be 
selected 
to  work 
with 
SWAOD 
to: 
(1) 
translate 
its 
Charter 
into 
a 
multiyear 
Business 
Plan 
with 
clear objectives,  output 
targets, 
and 
performance 
measures 
regarding 
the 
development  and 
management 
of 
water 
supply 
and 
wastewater 
assets; 
(2) 
prepare a 
Debt 
Management 
Policy, 
which 
projects 
future-years’  debt service 
and 
sources 
of 
financing 
for 
debt service 
for 
existing 
debt  obligations, 
sets 
targets 
for 
the 
capital financing 
mix 
taking 
into 
account  the  various 
legal 
and 
institutional 
constraints,  and 
sets 
goals 
for 
establishing and 
maintaining 
a 
good  credit 
rating 
with 
implications 
for 
debt management; 
and 
(3) 
finalizes 
a 
five-year investment 
plan, 
so 
that there 
is 
greater 
clarity 
regarding 
just 
which 
investments 
SWAOD 
is 
expected 
to 
finance. 
28. 
Once 
this 
preparatory 
work 
has 
been 
completed, 
SWAOD 
and the 
financial 
advisory team 
would 
prepare 
a 
Capital Financing 
Program, 
indicating 
how all 
of 
the 
investments 
it 
is 
tasked 
with 
undertaking 
would 
be 
financed. 
SWAOD 
and the 
financial 
advisory  team 
would 
assess 
the 
implications 
that 
the 
capital financing 
strategy 
has 
for 
total 
debt service 
by 
year, 
and 
the 
implications 
in 
turn 
of 
debt 
service 
requirements 
for 
water 
and 
wastewater 
tariffs. 
The 
national 
State 
Development 
and 
Reform 
Commission 
(SDRC)  and 
the 
national 
Ministry 
of 
Construction 
have 
in 
recent 
years 
notified 
provincial-level 
cities 
that they 
are 
expected 
to 
set 
water 
and 
wastewater 
tariff 
and 
fee schedules 
in 
the 
future 
so 
as 
to 
recover 
from 
users 
the 
full 
operating 
costs 
of 
systems 
plus 
depreciation, debt 
service, 
and 
other 
costs 
of 
capital. 
Lmplementation 
of 
these 
instructions 
should 
both simplify 
future 
capital 
finance 
planning 
and place 
environmental 
sector 
investment 
on 
much 
more 
solid 
ground. 
SWAOD 
and 
the 
financial 
advisory team 
would 
prepare 
recommended 
tariff 
schedules 
and 
identify 
SWAOD’s 
other 
sources 
of 
recurring 
revenue.

adequate

SWAOD’s

with 
margins 
as 
approved 
in 
SWAOD’s 
debt 
management 
policy 
31. 
At 
negotiations, 
it 
was 
agreed 
that: 
a) 
SWAOD 
would: 
(i) 
prepare 
and 
adopt 
a 
five-year 
capital 
investment 
plan  which 
includes 
a 
capital  financing 
plan, 
a 
debt 
management 
plan 
and 
a 
revenue 
adjustment plan;  and 
(ii) 
formulate 
the 
preliminary 
design 
of 
long-term 
bonds 
to 
finance environmental 
infrastructure; 
and 
(b) 
SMG 
would: 
(i) 
review 
the 
said 
preliminary 
design 
and 
submit 
it 
to 
the 
central 
government 
for 
approval;  and 
(ii) 
complete 
a 
time-bound action 
plan 
for 
Phase 
2 
in 
preparation 
for bond

issuance. 
It 
was 
further 
agreed that, 
providing 
approval 
of 
the 
National 
Government 
was 
obtained, 
SWAOD’s 
initial 
bond would 
be 
issued 
during 
Phase 
2, 
before 
moving forward 
to 
APL3, 
with 
a target 
date 
for 
issuance 
of 
June-July 
2005. 
32. 
The 
primary 
risks 
to 
this 
schedule 
are 
threefold. 
First, 
SWAOD 
may 
fail 
to compile 
three years 
of 
profitable 
operation 
or 
fail 
to 
meet 
some 
of 
the 
other 
output 
requirements 
of 
Phase 
1. 
This 
risk 
is 
judged 
to 
be 
small, 
given 
the 
importance 
to 
SWAOD 
of 
establishing 
its 
creditworthiness 
and 
the 
flexibility 
that 
SWAOD 
and 
SMG 
have 
of 
increasing 
its 
revenues. Second, 
SDRC 
may not 
approve a 
SWAOD 
bond 
issue, 
or 
SWAOD 
may 
fail 
to 
meet 
whatever replacement requirements are 
in 
effect 
at 
the 
national 
level 
at 
the 
time 
of 
proposed 
bond 
issuance. 
This 
risk 
is 
more 
substantial, 
as 
SDRC 
has 
strictly 
limited 
the 
aggregate 
volume 
of 
subnational 
bond 
issues. 
The 
future rules 
that 
may 
be 
incorporated 
in 
the 
bond-approval 
process are 
unknown. 
Based 
on 
discussions 
to 
date, 
however, 
it 
appears 
that 
the 
National 
Government 
would 
welcome 
a 
SWAOD 
bond 
issue 
if 
it 
sets 
a  precedent 
for 
prudent 
financial 
management 
and 
longer-term 
financing 
within 
the 
municipal 
environmental 
sector. 
Third, 
there 
is 
a 
risk 
that 
SMG 
would 
not 
approve 
the 
tariff 
adjustments 
or 
alternative  revenue 
sources 
necessary 
to 
assure 
SWAOD’s 
debt 
servicing 
capacity. 
This 
risk 
also 
is 
significant. 
Tariff 
adjustments 
are 
subject 
to 
a 
public 
hearing 
process. 
The 
tariff 
increases necessary 
are 
significant. 
At 
the 
same 
time, guidance 
has been 
given 
from 
the 
National 
Government 
to 
set 
tariffs 
and 
charges 
at cost-recovery levels. 
Any 
shortfalls 
are 
likely 
to 
be 
compensated 
by 
assigning 
SWAOD 
other revenue 
sources. 
It 
is 
by 
no 
means 
certain, however, that 
the 
revenue-generation system 
would 
be 
made 
predictable, reliable, 
and 
transparent, 
as 
well 
as 
adequate 
to 
cover 
SWAOD’s 
debt 
service. 
This 
would 
be 
a 
continuing 
focus 
of 
the Project, and 
so 
is 
partly 
within 
the 
influence 
of 
APL 
implementation. 
Financing 
the 
Environmental 
Infrastructure 
Requirements 
of 
Districts 
33. 
The 
investment program 
laid 
out 
in 
the 
APL 
recognizes 
the 
interdependence 
of 
Shanghai’s 
traditional 
urban 
core  and  the 
surrounding administrative 
areas, 
now 
established 
as 
districts. 
Water 
supply 
intakes 
for 
the 
traditional 
core 
would 
be protected 
by 
district 
investments 
aimed 
at 
improving 
river 
water 
quality. 
Much 
of 
the 
business 
investment 
now 
driving 
the Shanghai 
region’s economic 
growth 
takes 
place 
in 
the 
districts. 
34. 
This 
interdependence 
is 
not 
reflected 
in 
capital financing 
arrangements. 
District 
governments 
are 
responsible 
for 
financing  their 
infrastructure 
investment  requirements 
on 
their 
own, 
using 
their 
own 
budget 
resources 
and 
their 
own 
access 
to 
the 
capital 
market. Exceptions 
are 
made 
only 
on 
a 
case-by-case 
basis, 
and 
are 
rare. 
35. 
Discussions 
during 
APL 
preparation 
have 
produced 
a 
shared 
vision 
that extends 
to 
financing 
mechanisms 
some 
of 
the 
interdependence 
already 
recognized 
in 
infrastructure priority-setting, 
without 
violating 
the general 
rule 
that 
SMG 
would not 
subsidize the 
districts’  infrastructure 
investments. 
SMG 
would 
extend 
to 
the 
districts 
its 
favorable 
access 
to 
capital 
and 
credit 
markets 
through 
onlending, 
shared 
borrowing, 
or 
other 
forms 
of 
agreement. 
This 
change 
in 
policy 
promises 
to 
create 
expanded 
financing 
opportunities 
for 
the 
districts 
at 
competitive 
costs. 
Districts, 
for 
example, 
have 
not 
been 
permitted 
to 
issue 
their 
own 
bonds, 
and generally 
have been unable 
to 
match 
the 
credit 
terms 
available 
to 
SMG 
or 
to 
attract private-sector investors 
to 
the 
environmental 
sector. 
36. 
The institutional 
form 
and 
modus 
operandi 
of 
the 
District 
Financing 
Vehicle 
(DFV) 
would 
be 
developed 
during 
APL1. 
Several 
different 
models 
have 
been 
discussed. 
One 
model 
would 
create 
a 
revolving loan 
fund 
that 
would 
be 
financed 
both 
by 
a 
share 
of 
the 
World 
Bank loan 
and 
a 
share 
of 
the 
initial 
Shanghai 
bond 
issue 
or 
some 
other 
source 
of 
domestic  credit. 
The 
DFV 
would 
operate 
like 
a 
metropolitan-scale 
Municipal 
Development 
Fund. 
It 
would 
onlend 
to  District 
environmental 
asset 
- 
136 
- 
Page  141
companies 
to 
help 
finance 
key 
environmental 
projects. 
The 
World 
Bank 
and 
other 
international financial 
institutions 
(IFIs) 
have 
substantial 
experience 
with 
municipal 
development 
funds 
and 
similar 
intermediary  institutions 
used 
to 
finance 
smaller-scale 
investment 
projects  through 
onlending. 
The 
results, 
both 
in 
China 
and 
elsewhere, have been 
mixed. 
To 
be 
successful 
municipal 
development 
funds 
would: 
(a) 
operate 
in 
institutionally 
familiar 
ways 
so 
that projects can 
be approved 
and 
funds 
disbursed 
swiftly: 
(b) 
be 
able 
to provide 
credit, 
after 
allowance 
for 
administrative 
costs 
and 
bad-loan 
risks, 
at 
rates 
that 
are at 
least 
competitive 
with 
domestic 
banks; 
and 
(c) support, 
rather than 
supplant, 
development 
of 
the domestic 
credit 
market. 
37. 
A 
second 
model 
that 
has 
been 
discussed 
involves  creation 
of 
a 
Joint 
Venture  entity, 
where 
onlending 
of 
World 
Bank 
funds 
might 
be coupled 
with 
equity 
investments 
by 
a 
joint 
venture 
partner. 
In 
a 
third 
model, 
the 
DFV 
would 
serve 
a 
facilitative 
rather than 
direct 
financing 
role. 
It 
would 
review district 
project 
proposals, 
confirm 
that a proposed 
project 
is 
well 
designed 
and cost-effective,  then 
assign 
it 
a 
special 
credit 
enhancement, such 
as 
fiscal 
intercept 
authority 
(i.e., 
the 
right 
of 
lenders 
or 
investors 
to 
“intercept” 
fiscal 
transfers 
in 
the 
event that a 
district fails 
to 
meet 
its 
debt service 
obligations, 
during 
the 
process 
of 
financial 
settlement 
between 
the 
municipal 
and 
district 
governments). 
Backed 
by 
this 
kind 
of 
support, 
a 
district  project 
then 
could qualify  for 
a  preapproved 
line 
of 
credit 
from 
a 
participating 
domestic bank, 
or 
present 
a 
low-risk 
profile to 
a 
potential 
nonstate 
investor. 
In 
this 
model, 
domestic 
bank 
lending to 
approved 
projects 
could 
be matched 
with World 
Bank 
loan 
funds 
provided 
to district project 
companies 
through 
the 
district 
finance 
bureaus, 
the 
same 
channel  that 
is 
being 
used 
to 
supply 
WB 
financing 
to 
district 
projects 
in 
APL1. 
38. 
SMG 
has 
assigned 
to 
UDIC 
lead 
responsibility 
for 
evaluating 
the 
various 
options 
and 
establishing 
the 
DFV. 
An 
SMG 
Steering Committee, 
consisting 
of 
representatives 
of 
the 
Development 
Planning 
Commission, 
the 
Finance 
Bureau, 
the 
Construction 
and 
Management Commission, 
other 
project 
agencies 
as 
needed 
and 
local 
banks, 
would 
be 
formed 
to 
work 
with 
UDIC 
on 
program 
design. 
UDIC 
has 
expressed 
a strong 
preference, 
consistent 
with 
APL 
goals, 
that the 
DFV 
operate 
on 
commercial 
terms 
with 
limited 
credit 
risk 
exposure. 
Key 
Issues 
to 
Be 
Resolved 
39. 
One. 
Several 
key 
issues 
regarding 
the 
DFV 
operations 
have 
been 
identified 
for 
resolution 
during 
Phase 
(1) 
Credit 
Risk 
of 
Subloans. 
A 
lending or 
onlending 
model 
can 
operate 
commercially 
only 
if 
there 
is 
low 
risk 
in 
underlying 
loan 
repayments. 
UDIC 
characterized the 
districts 
and 
district project 
companies 
as 
generally 
low 
credit 
risks, 
but 
felt 
that repayment 
risk 
still 
was 
too 
high 
to 
make 
onlending 
attractive 
to 
commercial 
investors. Repayment 
risk 
is 
perhaps 
higher 
for 
an 
institution 
like 
UDIC, 
which 
in 
the past 
has 
provided 
districts 
with 
funds 
that 
are 
not 
expected 
to 
be 
repaid, 
than the 
risk 
for 
clearly 
identified 
commercial 
lenders. 
International 
experience  indicates  that  the 
surest 
way  to 
eliminate 
onlending 
risk 
is 
to 
introduce 
“intercept” 
authority, 
which 
permits  the 
DFV 
or 
other 
lender 
to 
be 
paid 
directly 
by 
the 
municipal 
government 
from 
funds 
otherwise 
due 
to 
the 
district, 
in 
the event 
that debt service 
payments 
are 
not 
made 
on 
time. 
Alternatively, 
lending 
contracts can 
require 
that 
borrowing 
districts 
establish dedicated 
reserve 
accounts 
that 
can 
be 
tapped 
directly 
by 
the 
DFV 
for 
debt 
service 
payment. 
Certain 
types 
of 
revenue 
collected 
at 
the 
district 
level may 
be 
paid directly 
into 
these 
dedicated reserve 
accounts. 
The 
Shanghai 
Finance 
Bureau indicated 
that 
there are 
now 
two 
types 
of 
fiscal 
flows 
between 
the 
SMG 
- 
137- 
Page  142
and 
district-level 
governments. 
First, 
districts 
receive 
an 
amount 
of 
transfer 
from 
the 
municipal 
government. 
Second, 
there 
are  taxes 
that 
districts 
collect 
on 
behalf 
of 
the 
municipal 
and 
district 
governments. 
Districts 
transfer a 
portion 
of 
the 
receipts 
to 
the 
municipal 
government, 
and a 
percentage 
of 
the 
portion 
is 
later 
refunded 
back to 
the 
districts 
under the current 
tax-sharing 
program. 
It 
was agreed 
that 
during 
Phase 
One, 
it 
would 
be 
determined 
whether 
fiscal 
“intercept” 
arrangements 
are 
institutionally 
feasible, 
and 
whether 
alternative forms 
of 
credit 
risk 
mitigation 
are 
feasible. Reduced 
credit 
risk 
would 
enhance 
the 
operation 
of 
all 
models 
of 
the 
DFV. 
(2) 
World 
Bank 
and 
DFV 
Project 
Review. 
Many 
Municipal 
Development 
Funds 
have 
failed 
because 
there  are  elaborate 
requirements 
regarding 
project  review 
and 
approval. 
Streamlined 
loan 
applications  and 
timely loan 
decisions 
are 
essential 
to 
the 
success 
of 
a 
commercial 
model 
of 
lending. 
It 
was 
agreed 
that the 
UDIC 
Steering 
Committee 
would try 
to 
identify 
the 
most 
straightforward institutional 
arrangements 
and loan 
approval 
processes 
acceptable 
to 
both 
SMG 
and 
the 
World 
Bank. 
(3) 
Domestic 
Bank 
Lines 
of 
Credit. 
It 
was 
agreed 
that 
early 
in 
Phase 
One  the 
UDIC 
Steering 
Committee 
would 
meet 
with 
local 
banks 
to 
determine 
their 
interest 
in 
financing 
or 
cofinancing district 
loan 
projects, 
or 
participating 
in 
other 
forms 
of 
credit financing 
for 
district 
projects.  Banks 
could be 
invited 
to 
be 
permanent 
members 
of 
the 
Steering 
Committee. 
One 
goal 
would 
be 
to 
structure 
the 
DFV 
so 
that 
it 
had 
the 
greatest value-added 
in 
helping 
districts 
get 
access 
to longer-term financing 
from 
banks 
for 
environmental 
projects. 
Banks 
would 
be 
asked 
to 
identify 
the 
critical 
gaps 
that  a 
DFV 
could 
fill 
to 
support 
longer-term 
lending--whether 
this 
involved 
technical 
project review, 
credit 
enhancement, 
or 
other 
steps. 
APLl 
and 
APL2 Work 
Products 
40. 
It 
was agreed 
during 
appraisal that 
all 
preparatory 
work 
for 
the 
DFV 
would 
be completed 
during 
APL1. 
Before 
moving to 
APL2, 
the 
Steering 
Committee and 
UDIC 
would 
recommend 
a 
specific version 
of 
the 
SPV 
for 
adoption. 
A 
timetable 
for 
establishing the 
DFV 
would 
be 
agreed 
between 
SMG 
and the 
Bank 
before 
moving to 
APL2, 
and  a 
mutually 
acceptable 
Work 
Plan 
for 
implementation 
would be 
adopted. 
Actual 
establishment 
of 
DFV 
would 
occur 
in 
APL2, along 
with 
the 
initial 
environmental 
project 
financings 
supported 
by 
the 
DFV. 
It 
is 
recognized that 
it 
is 
possible 
that 
UDIC, 
SMG, 
and 
the 
Bank 
may 
conclude 
as 
a 
result 
of 
APLl 
investigations 
that 
it 
is 
not 
practicable 
to 
set 
up 
a 
DFV 
or 
that  such 
a 
Vehicle 
would 
add 
only minimally to 
financing 
opportunities 
already available. 
41. 
A 
domestic  and 
international 
advisory  team 
would 
be 
selected 
to work 
with 
UDIC 
and the 
Steering 
Committee 
on 
DFV 
design 
and implementation. 
The 
advisory 
team 
would 
provide 
international 
experience 
with 
similar  financial 
intermediaries, 
including 
experience 
with 
Environmental 
Revolving 
Funds 
elsewhere 
in 
China. 
It 
also 
would 
collaborate 
with 
UDIC 
and the Steering 
Committee 
in 
assessing 
districts’ 
demands 
for 
capital  financing 
from 
a 
DFV 
and 
their 
preferences 
regarding  institutional 
structure; 
in 
worlung 
with 
banks 
and 
other 
SMG 
institutions 
to 
identify 
the 
step-by-step procedures 
that 
would be involved 
in 
loan 
or 
investment 
approval 
and 
the  disbursement 
of 
funds; 
in 
establishing 
eligibility 
criteria for district 
projects; 
and 
in 
all 
other 
aspects 
of 
institutional 
design.
