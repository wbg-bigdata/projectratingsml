Shanghai Urban Environment Project
(Draft)
1   Introduction
1.1 Background
The Shanghai Municipal Government (SMG) has adopted an ambitious and for-ward looking Five
Year Development Plan in which it seeks to enhance the economic, financial, trade and
manufacturing stature of Shanghai, with Shanghai becoming a sustainable global competitive
city-region, and an international economic, trade and shipping centre at the heart of the important
Yangtze Delta. The SMG places a high priority on meeting six overall goals:
1) developing Shanghai's economic strengths, keeping a sustainable, rapid and sound
economic growth;
2) developing Shanghai's services sector, particularly its functions as a centre of international
trade and high value-added manufacturing, building Shanghai as a city with plenty of
business opportunities and comparatively low cost for both domestic and foreign investors;
3) improving Shanghai's environmental conditions towards a Liveable City, to enhance the
living conditions of the city's citizens, and to attract foreign and domestic investment;
4) developing Shanghai's innovation capacities, particularly education and R+D;
5) improving urban management, exploring new measures to manage this emerging modern
city; and
6) improving the citizen's quality of life.
Attainment of these goals will require substantial investments and improvements in urban
environmental management and in urban development management.
The policies and programs through which these goals are being addressed are outlined in sector
master plans for wastewater management, solid waste management, and forestation. The recent
revision of these plans has all been completed, and is currently being reviewed by the government.
They are expected to be approved for implementation very soon.
Based on SMG's Long Term Development Strategy, and the comprehensive Tenth Five Year Plan,
very specific performance targets and action plans have been prepared in each of these revised
(APL EA Draft En 0202.doc)
-4-



Environmental Assessment for Shanghai Urban Environment Project
sector master plans. These sector master plans have outlined the specific targets, and provided a
solid foundation for the proposed Shanghai Urban Environment Project (SHUEP).
Collaboration with the World Bank in urban infrastructure and environment investments during the
last decade has been very successful. The Shanghai Municipal Government wishes to continue this
collaboration through an integrated program of investments and associated reforms under a
proposed Adaptable Program Loan (APL).
1.2 Legislative and Regulatory Considerations
In accordance with the requirements of «<Environmental Protection Law of People's Republic of
China»> and «<Guidelines for Environmental Management of Construction Projects>», environmental
impact assessment (EIA) shall be conducted to any proposed new construction, reconstruction or
expansion projects. An environmental impact statement should be prepared to address the present
environmental quality at location where a proposed project has been sited, and assess possible
impacts in both construction period and after its commissioning. There have been a series of
regulations and standards both at State and local levels available for governing the assessment.
Besides, the environmental impact statement should include stipulated measures for pollution
prevention and control. The statement shall be submitted to the administrative departments
responsible for environmental protection for approval. The planning departments shall not approve
a project until its environmental impact statement has been reviewed and approved.
According to World Bank's policies, environmental impact assessment (EIA) is an instrument to
identify and assess the potential environmental impacts of a proposed project, evaluate alternatives,
and design appropriate mitigation, management, and monitoring measures. The SHUEP has been
determined by the Bank to be subject to Category A EA requirements, based on the fact that a
number of the individual investment components will require a Category A environmental
assessment.
As a topic of the environment has been concerned world-wide, the World Bank provides guidance
for Bank-financed projects on EA to cover specific sectors as well as cross-sectoral issues. In the
Bank statements, some of the emphasised issues that may be related to the proposed SHUEP
include environmental action plans; water resources management, pest management, safeguarding
cultural property, involuntary resettlement, and etc. Those topics should be addressed in the EA
report.

Environmental Assessment for Shangai Urban Environment ProJect
2 Proposed APL Development Programme
2.1 Overall Structure of the Strategic Framework
A preliminary Development Programme for the proposed APL is based on the detailed assessment
of practical demands, urgency of projects in each environmental infrastructure sub sector, status of
project preparation, and careful review of a wide range of institutional and other actions proposed
by the govermment's agencies that are desirable, practical and attainable as triggers in the APL.
'The SMG has adopted an ambitious and forward looking Five Year Development Plan in which it
seeks to enhance the economic, financial, trade and manufacturing stature of Shanghai, with
Shanghai becoming a sustainable global competitive city-region, and one of international
economic, finance, trade and shipping centres at the heart of the important Yangtze Delta. The APL
aims to help the government to implement its development strategy in an enviromnentally and
institutionally sustainable manner, it aims to provide major long term environmental benefits to the
millions of citizens and to the ecology of the greater Shanghai region, and aims to help SMG in its
goal of developing innovative policies, institutional reforms and financing methods that will not
only transform the way SMG operates, but more importantly will serve as- models for local
government and environmental reform throughout China.
Three phases are proposed. Phase One will focus on wastewater infrastructure and a first set of
high priority solid waste infrastructure investments serving the City Proper (the area within the
Outer Ring Road) and the Upper Huangpu Catchments Area. It will continue and expand on the
strategic investments made with the World Bank on the Shanghai Environment Project (SEP) and
Shanghai Sewerage Projects. In addition, redevelopment of the historic area in the city centre, and
an urban landscaping component to improve Shanghai's urban environment are also included.
Phase One will start in the second half of 2002 and extend to the end of 2007.
Phase Two, while still addressing infrastructure and environment needs in the City Proper
dominated by the investment of Solid Waste #2 and Urban Landscaping, will provide an
opportunity to support the efforts of suburban District and County governments in improving the
level and quality of urban infrastructure services, particularly the investment of several waste water
treatment plants in the rural area. Phase Two will start a program of redeveloping large industrial
communities within the city to improve the urban environment and serve SMG's strategy of
building an ecological Shanghai. Innovative institutional and financing arrangements will be
tested in Phase Two, both in the City Proper and in suburban Districts. Phase Two would
commence in the second half of 2003 and extend to 2008.
Phase Three, while continuing the efforts of redeveloping large industrial communities in the city,
will focus on the air pollution management, particularly, prompting CNG for public buses to
replace gasoline, and building CNG gas stations. This is one of the measures that SMG has now
considered under its energy restructuring strategy to manage the emerging trend that the increasing
vehicle pollution is now gradually becoming the major source of air pollution in this city. In Phase
Three, priority is also given to the rehabilitation of infrastructure that has reached its useful service
life in the City Proper. It is tentatively planned to commence at the start of 2006 and extend to the
end of 2010.

market-based instruments user charge instruments and waste reduction;
policies and enabling regulations for service/management contracts and/or concessions;
. plan and prospectuses for new forms of infrastructure and environment protection
financing, and an independent mechanism for price setting for water and wastewater
(regulatory authority or commission), with tariffs being reviewed and regulated by this
agency.
Physical urban environment investments would be in wastewater management, Upper Huangpu
River wastewater management, solid waste management, urban infrastructure upgrading, urban
environment improvement, environmental quality monitoring, and senior management training
and institutional strengthening. The details are as follows:
1) Urban Wastewater Management. Completion of wastewater collection systems and
treatment facilities to treat all wastewater generated in the Shanghai metropolitan urban

*  food services solid waste management: the city is facing a challenge of managing the
wet waste caused by an unanticipated surge in small restaurants, and the growing
number of small-scale food vendors;
*  the expansion and upgrading of the strategic Laogang landfill (Phase IV) over a
four-year period; and
*  addition of facility management capacities to the Sanitation Bureau's GIS to improve
infrastructure operations.
3) Investment in three small-scale wastewater treatment plants identified in the Upper
Huangpu Protection Plan.
4) Shanghai Old Town Greenbelt Ring Project, an 8.96 ha node in north east corner of the
Shanghai Old Town in Huangpu District as part of the government's ongoing program of
constructing a round greenbelt enclosing the Old Town.
5) Investment to protect and rehabilitate Shanghai's historic area in former Nanshi District
(now amalgamated into Huangpu District).
Actions that the Shanghai Municipal Government is currently considering to propose as the
"'triggers" of Phase One include:
1) Prepare a satisfactory Letter of Development Programme and related Project Program;
2) Prepare an updated Wastewater Management Plan, including the management of disposal
of sludge;
3) Prepare an updated Solid Waste Management Plan;

in districts and counties.
5) Launch the water resource protection plan;
6) Agree in principle on the following:
*  extend the role of Shanghai Water Authority to become a Greater Shanghai Water
Management Authority with overall responsibility for the planning and co-ordination of
all water sector management policies and interventions throughout the area of the
Shanghai Municipality;
*  raise domestic capital using appropriate financial instruments, and creating requ-ired
environment;
*  seek private sector participation in service provision (through bidding process) and
remove impediments over time.
7) Extend the current solid waste charges to cover restaurants for food waste.
In addition to the DRA assistance currently being provided through the World Bank's PHRD, SMG
is considering possible additional requirements for technical assistance in:
1 ) Institutional capacity building and training;
2) Urban environment infrastructure assets operation and management (water supply,
wastewater and solid waste);
3) Pollution Permit Trading;
4) Technical services for the Survey of Agricultural Pollution in Upper Huangpu Water
Resource Protection Region;
5) Metropolitan Water Resource Management & Policy;
6) Metropolitan Solid Waste Management and technical services on the topic of solid waste
tariff, solid waste minimisation, Government's Monitoring of Non-State Service
Delivery/Operation;
7) Management and treatment technology of Food Waste; and
8) Design and operation of Rural Environmental Infrastructure Investment Revolving Fund
(the Rural Water Resource Protection Pilot Fund).
2.2.2  Phase Two
The objectives of Phase Two are to:
1) Continue support for the implementation of the solid waste management master plan;
2) Support the implementation of the government's Landscaping and Forestation Master Plan
outside the Outer Ring Road; and
3) Introduce and test innovative approaches to redeveloping of large-scale industrial
communities in the city, and introduce innovative approaches to the financing of
environmental infrastructure in both the City Proper and in suburban districts.
Phase Two would include further policy and institutional reform measures, including:
(APL EA Draft En 0202.doc)
g9-



Environmental Assessment for Shanghai Urban Environment Project
*  completion of implementation of the first stage of water conservation and sludge
management programs;
*  Corporatisation of some 50 % of solid waste services, and upgraded institutional
arrangements for service providers/producers implemented;
.  implementation of upgraded municipal solid waste management program, and a
demonstrated (at least 20% social capital ownership and financing) level of social capital
participation and new financing approach in the water supply, wastewater and solid waste
sectors;
* with long term domestic bonds routinely issued for infrastructure financing.
Physical investments in urban wastewater management, Upper Huangpu River wastewater
management, urban solid waste management, urban infrastructure upgrading, urban environment
improvement, and institutional strengthening. Four components are under consideration:
1) Solid Waste # 2 which would comprise investments in:
* Containerisation of solid waste and improvements in transport to landfill, composting
and incineration facilities;
* Separation of solid wastes at source, and transfer to collection stations;
* Improvements to solid waste haulage from collection stations through fleet upgrading
and selected road improvements at regional receiving sites; and
* Centralised treatment facilities of ordinary industrial solid waste and hospital disposals.
2) Forestation, consisting of three investments:
* Continue investment in the government's ongoing program of constructing a 500 meter
greenbelt along the Outer Ring Road;
* Reforestation in a strategic corridor along the Upper Huangpu River; and
* Landscaping along the transportation corridor from Shanghai through Chongming
Island, to Northern Jiangsu.
3) To assist the rural district government in their investment of wastewater treatment plants.
Priority will be given to the key areas such as Upper Huangpu Water Resource Zone, new
seaport area in Nanhui District, and Chongming County. Subject to the approval from
central government, an innovative pooled financing vehicle: a pilot Rural Water Resource
Area Protection Fund (an Infrastructure Revolving Fund capitalised by SMG under the
APL, and from which UDICs and infrastructure operating companies in suburban districts
could borrow for capital investments of wastewater management infrastructures) will be
explored, and ideally would be tested to finance one wastewater plant in the rural region if
feasible.
4) Focusing on redeveloping a large industrial community in the City Proper. SMG has been
strongly supporting the redevelopment of sub-standard residential areas throughout the
city during the past decade. It is interested in proceeding to the next stage of renewal by
addressing the many complex issues surrounding the redevelopment of large tracts of land
(APL EA Drafi En 0202.doc)
- 10-



Environmental Assessment for Shanghai Urban Environment Project
occupied by municipally-owned industrial SOEs. These large areas comprise not only
industrial sites but also extensive residential and public facilities and supporting
infrastructure. Innovative approaches to redevelopment of these areas will be explored,
including the codification and transfer of property rights, asset valuation, and the formation
of public-private land development corporations to access non-state financing. The site for
this component need to be identified, but the industrial communities in Yangpu District is
recommended at this point with a consideration that sewage system of this area will be
improved under Wastewater Management #3 in APL Phase 1, it would make more sense if
a urban redevelopment component would follow.
Actions that SMG is currently considering to propose as triggers to Phase Two include:
1) Approval of Huangpu Water Resource Protection Master Plan and Catchment
Management Plan, including control of all pollution sources within the catchment area, and
the related institutional framework;
2) Implementation of a comprehensive public outreach water conservation program;
3) Approval of a comprehensive solid waste management plan, including the adoption of
market-based instruments for user charges, treatment, disposal and tipping fees, service
pricing policies, waste reduction, recycling, resource recovery and the handling and
disposal of hazardous and hospital waste;
4) Completion of policy and enabling regulation for service/management contracts and/or a
concession, and the signing of a social capital participation contract (BOT or concession)
for a wastewater treatment facility;
5) Completion of plan and prospectus for the issuance of long term domestic bonds for
infrastructure financing. Shanghai will make its best efforts to obtain approval of the
national government;
6) Studies on the policies and plans for establishing pilot municipal fund for water resource
protection;
7) Regulation drafted and submitted for municipal approval for agricultural pollution control
in greater Shanghai area.
Technical assistance requirements for Phase Two could include:
1) Continue TA on institutional capacity building and training;
2) Advisory services on Urban Landscaping and Large Scale Public Green Space focused on
the issues of physical planning, financing & investment management, cost sharing and
recovery, relocation and O+M mechanism;
3) Wastewater Sludge Management;
4) Private Participation in Service Delivery, and Commercialisation of Infrastructure Service
Delivery, (in particular the performance monitoring for non-state delivery);
5) Advisory services on Regional Service Delivery Mechanisms; and
6) Other necessary TAs that might be identified during the APL implementation.

Environmental Assessment for Shanghai Urban Environment Project
2.2.3 Phase Three
The objectives of Phase Three are to:
1) support government's program of redeveloping large industrial conmmunities within the
city that are undergoing pressures from industrial re-structuring;
2) support the implementation of SMG's CNG program under its energy restructuring
strategy targeted for improving the air quality in the city, and
3) rehabilitation and upgrading of the more and more existing over-run wastewater treatment
facilities in the old city proper.
Phase Three would include physical investments in Upper Huangpu River wastewater management,
urban infrastructure upgrading, urban environment improvement, and institutional strengthening.
Three components are being considered:
1) Industrial Community Redevelopment #2. Project site is to be identified close to the end of
Industrial Community Redevelopment #1 under APL Phase Two. Possible sites could be
an expanded area in Yangpu District (if Yangpu is selected for Industrial Community
Redevelopment #1 under APL Phase Two) or communities in Wusong and Taopu
industrial areas within the city proper (in Outer Ring Road).
2) Municipal environment improvement project including city greening phase 3 and the
investment of renovation of public buses for CNG construction of CNG gas stations, coal
de-sulphuring and probably the CNG thermnal power plants. SMG gave a high priority to
this component in Phase Three so as to manage the growing pressure of vehicle pollution to
the city's air quality in addition to the other measures that the government has put in place
such as new standards of exhaust gas for automobiles, etc.
3) Wastewater Infrastructure Rehabilitation.  A considerable proportion of collection
networks in older urban areas is becoming obsolete, and need to be upgraded. In addition,
older wastewater treatment facilities in selected areas are occupying what has become
valuable land; their relocation, consolidation or closure could be undertaken in this
component of the APL.
Actions that the government is currently considering to trigger Phase Three include:
1) Completion of implementation of the first stage water conservation and sludge
management programs;
2) Corporatisation of 30% to 50% of solid waste services, and upgraded institutional
arrangements for service providers/producers implemented;
3) Implementation of upgraded municipal solid waste management program, including waste
minimisation, recycling, residential user charges and tipping fees;
4) Level of social capital participation and new financing approach in water supply,
wastewater and solid waste sectors reaches to 10% to 20%;
5) Under the precondition of obtaining the approval from the State government, the planned
long term domestic bonds will be issued;

3.1 Analysis of Compatibility of APL Strategic Framework with Shanghai Master Plan
It is stated in Article 29 of Planning Law of P. R. China that all the land use and construction within
the city planning area shall comply with the city planning, and following related administration.
Based on Shanghai City Master Plan (1999 - 2020) and Instruction for Shanghai City Master Plan
(2010) endorsed by China State Council in May 2001, the assessment will address the
compatibility of the strategic framework for APL Shanghai Urban Environment Project with
Shanghai City Master Plan.
The analysis shows that APL strategic framework is in full compatibility with Shanghai City
Master Plan (Table 3-1).

Environmental Assessment for Shanghai Urban Environment Project
3.2 Compatibility with Comprehensive Redevelopment Programme along Riversides of the
Huangpu River
3.2.1 Briefing on Comprehensive Redevelopment Programme along Riversides of the
Huangpu River
The municipal government of Shanghai formally launched a Comprehensive Development
Programme on Riverside along the Huangpu River on the 10th Jan 2002. It will be another
ambitious project following Pudong development started 12 years ago in Shanghai. The project
aims to developing riversides along the Huangpu River into an international-level one,
demonstrating the city's image. The riversides will be shifted from current warehouses and docks
to financial and trade zone, tourist attraction, and residential areas. It will help Shanghai to reach
its long-term objective, i.e., an international centre of economy, finance, trade, and shipping. Total
investment is expected to be 100 billion yuan RMB.
The ambitious project will cross five administrative districts as Pudong, Luwan, Huangpu,
Hongkou and Yangpu. Total planning area is 2,260 ha with riverbank of 20 km long. Four areas
are planned to be the focal points:
*  Yangpu Bridge: This area, 1.99 kM2, will be a residential area as well as an education,
science & technology park.
* Shanghai shipyard to north Bund: This area, 1.06 km2, will be renovated focusing on
shipyard rebuilding and international water transport centre setup. Docks at Shanghai
Shipping Yard will be rebuilt into a tourist and entertainment site, meanwhile, office and
residential buildings will be set up along the riverside. These constructions at the crossing
of Huangpu River and Suzhou Creek together with buildings at Bund and Liujiazui
Financing and Trade Zone will form a unique landscape in Shanghai.
*  Shiliu Pu to Dongchang Area: This area, 0.35 kin2, will be developed into a residential area.
Existing water transport station will be removed, and some warehouses will be rebuilt into a
holiday market. An Old Town will be set up as a new tourist and shopping centre among the
traditional architectures of Yu Garden. The Old town and new development zone, past and
future will be linked here.
* Nanpu Daqiao: This area is about 3.43 km2 large. It will be developed into an area for
living, working and entertainment. The site of 2010 Expo will be the hot spot in this area. It
is planned that a man-made isle will be set up, like Fuxing Isle at downstream of the
Huangpu.
When all the development projects along the Huangpu are completed, two axes in the City will
come into being. One is a east-to-west axis from Century Park in Pudong to Hongqiao
Development Zone in Puxi, and the other is a north-to-south axis that is along the city's artery,
Huangpu River, and will be the shining star demonstrating Shanghai's development in the 21st
century.

Environmental Assessment for Shanghai Urban Environment Project
3.2.2 Analysis of Compatibility of APL Strategic Framework with Comprehensive
Redevelopment Programme of Riversides along the Huangpu
Comprehensive redevelopment of riverside of the Huangpu is the core project for Shanghai to
implement the City Master Plan in the new century. Therefore, all the construction projects shall be
in line with this core task, helpful to the environmental improvement and functional change of the
Huangpu River.
1) Sharing common development target
These two projects are bearing the common strategic objectives that are to build Shanghai into an
international centre of economy, trade, finance and shipping, to improve the overall environmental
quality and living standard, and to upgrade the sustainability of Shanghai. The two projects are
compatible and supplementary to each other.
2) SHUEP in APL Programme will facilitate the comprehensive redevelopment on riverbank site
along Huangpu
*  The service area of SSP-III covers Baoshan, Hongkou, Yangpu and Pudong districts.
Except Baoshan District, the rest areas are included in the major redevelopment zone in
Huangpu River project;
*  Construction of WWTPs at Upper Huangpu aims to protect drinking water source and
improve water quality at water intake. Downstream users will be benefited;
*  Solid waste management project will provide a sound solution for the domestic refuse,
restaurant wastes, hospital wastes through waste minimisation, reusing and recycling;
*  The Old Town project, listed in the SHUEP, is also suggested in Huangpu River
redevelopment project.
•  Some urban infrastructure engineering and rehabilitation of industrial zones are also
covered in Huangpu River redevelopment project.
3) Policy mechanism for Huangpu River redevelopment project is just what is advocated in APL
strategic framework
To facilitate the comprehensive redevelopment of riversides along Huangpu River, the SMG has
released a group of favourite policies. The role of government will be changed with planning,
policy support and service as major tasks.  Shanghai has established Huangpu River
Redevelopment Investment (Group) Ltd. to care the project physical operation. In the APL
strategic framework it is stressed that the role of government should be changed from an investor of
environmental infrastructure and a direct service provider into an organiser and a mediator.
Financing through various sources and establishing environmental industries to provide services
are advocated. In fact, China's entry into WTO has already laid a common platform for the SHUEP
in APL Programme and Comprehensive Redevelopment Project of Riversides along Huangpu
River. These two projects are with same innovative policy mechanism.

3.3 Assessment of Impact on Regional Environment Quality in Shanghai
3.3.1 Regional Environmental Objectives in Shanghai
3.3.1.1 Objective of Ambient Air Quality
An integrated objective of ambient air quality by 2005 is to make Shanghai a metropolis with good
ambient air quality, suitable for business development and living whilst the main index of ambient
air quality should reach the average level of same kind of metropolis in developed countries in mid
1990s. By 2010, the main index of ambient air quality will reach the same level of developed
countries.
3.3.1.2 Objective of Surface Water Quality
Objective of water quality in the end of "the tenth five year" period is to let the black and stink be
eliminated in main waterways in city proper area, the pollution of suburban waterways be arrested,
water quality of Suzhou Creek and The Huangpu River improve continuously, so as to improve the
aquatic ecosystem step by step, and let fishes return in river.
A long-term objective is to overall meet the requirement for water environmental functions, let
fishes appear in rivers with beautiful scenery along rivers, so as to create a good ecological
environment in Shanghai.
3.3.1.3 Objective of Acoustic Environment
Short-term objective of the acoustic environment is:
100% compliance for regional ambient noise;
90% compliance for traffic noise;
* 90% compliance for stationary sources;

Long-term objective:
* 100% compliance for regional ambient noise;
* 95% compliance for traffic noise;
* 100% compliance for stationary sources;
* 28 more neighbourhoods and areas in compliance.
3.3.1.4 Objective of Solid Waste Disposal
Focused on no harm disposal of domestic garbage, to establish a service system of sorting.
collection and minimisation and reusing, to construct secure landfill site for hazardous wastes, thus
form a sanitary management and garbage disposal system for a mega-metropolis. By 2005, 90% of
city proper area will practise sorted collection of domestic garbage, the garbage reuse rate will
reach 64%. In the "tenth five year" period, it is planned to invest 8.4 billion yuan to construct 53
garbage handling facilities and 11 comprehensive solid waste treatment plants basically to realise
the no harm of domestic garbage and comprehensive utilisation of industrial solid wastes.
3.3.1.5 Objective of Greening Planning
The new round of integrated planning objective is to readjust the layout of green land, compliment
(APL EA Draft En 0202.doc)

Environmental Assessment for Shanzhai Urban Environment Project
types of green land, make city scenic spots abundant, and improve urban environment quality. The
objective is to form a large greening system in urban environment of city proper which take
"circulation, insertion, gallery, garden" as the basic, combining with forest land at seashore, green
land in beaches, shelter green land and greening along both sides of main traffic roads and the
corridor of high tension lines, greening belts along rivers, orchards, economical forests, scenery
areas and special green lands.
Near-term objective is to achieve over 6 m2 of public green space per capita, over 12 m2 of green
space per capita, and greening rate > 18%, greening coverage rate > 30%.
2
Long-term objective by 2020 is to reach public green space per capita > 10 m2, green space per
capita > 21 m , greening coverage rate > 35%.
3.3.2 Actions Planned to Improve Local Environment in Shanghai
To continuously improve the environment and provide a sound environmental infrastructure for
living and business in Shanghai, an environmental planning, the objectives for medium and long
term environmental protection, as well as the action plan for 2001 - 2005 have been set out in
Shanghai based on the city master plan. The implementation of projects according to APL strategic
framework along with city renewal will push the city-wide implementation of the environmental
plan.
3.3.2.1 Actions for Ambient Air Protection
The actions planned to improve ambient air will be:
*  to relocate polluting enterprises within the city centre;
*  to make balanced use of energy such as prohibiting new installation of coal-fired facilities
within Inner Ring Road and promote electricity-based energy consumption;
*  to renovate coal-fired industrial boilers of small-and-medium size with natural gas fired
ones;
* to introduce clean coal technology and establish co-generation facilities within the area
between Inner Ring Road and Outer Ring Road; and
* to promote cleaner production technology and enhance pollution control over existing
point sources.
To ensure the roadside air quality compliant with Class 2 level of National Ambient Air Quality
Standard, following measures will be implemented:
To enforce a more rigid vehicle exhaust standard for new vehicle, European III standard
will be enforced on light-duty vehicles by the year 2008, while for heavy-duty vehicles and
motorcycles, it is required that the emission standard shall be in line with the international
practice by the year 2010.
* To improve inspection and maintenance on the vehicles in use;
To promote cleaner fuel application for vehicles;
* To boost mass transportation and implement a regional traffic volume control programme,
and etc.

Enviromnmental Assessment for Shangha Urban Environment Projlect
3.3.2.2 Actions for Water Environment Protection
Following actions planned will be implemented for the water environment improvement:
*  The industries with direct discharge of effluent into The Huangpu River will be relocated;
*  Dry weather flow being discharged into The Huangpu River via pumping stations will be
intercepted into the sewerage system;
*  Sewage interception system for Pudong section of SSP-II will collect the sewage which is
currently directly discharged into The Huangpu River, and completed during 2001 - 2005;
*  The existing hydraulic infrastructure will be fully deployed to regulate the water flow in
some small-and-medium sized waterways;
*  Land areas between Nanpu and Yangpu Bridges will be rehabilitated based on the scheme
approved by SMG.
3.3.3  Potential Impact of the Strategic Framework on Regional Environment
3.3.3.1 Improvement on Air Quality
As the air pollution is quite concerned in Shanghai, SMG gave a high priority to it. An air pollution
control component could be included in APL Programme. This could comprise the conversion of
boilers used for district heating, and conversion of buses and taxis for use of cleaner fuel, e.g., CNG,
etc. to deal with the growing pressure of vehicle pollution to the city's air quality. Such kind of
action is actually a part of the planned measures to be taken for improving the ambient air, and will
no doubt benefit the environment in Shanghai.
In addition, in connection with the proposed components in the programme, a series of different
sectoral actions are closely related to the improvement of local air quality. Those could include the
upgrading of operation process in collection, transport and disposal of garbage by solid waste
management, greening and landscaping for city centre upgrading by urban rehabilitation,
eliminating of the black and stink in the waterways in the city proper by wastewater management,
and so on.
3.3.3.2 Improvement on Water Environment
It is expected that the implementation of proposed APL strategic framework will reduce sewage of
considerable amount directly discharged into the Huangpu River and its tributaries. This will
somewhat improve the water quality.
If the implementation of projects of APL is coincided with Shanghai Tenth Five-Year Water
Environmental Plan, there will be a great improvement in the water environment in Shanghai. At
that time, over 70% of direct loadings in the middle and lower reaches of The Huangpu River could
be reduced to result in the water quality there meeting Category IV level; whilst over 40% of direct
loadings in the upper Huangpu would be cut down to make the water quality achieving Category III.
For the major waterways in the City Proper, Category V level could be met.
Meanwhile, the rehabilitation on land area along the downtown section of The Huangpu River will
be synchronically implemented. Bustling downtown together with rivers and green pedestrian
corridors will be a unique feature for Shanghai, a city by water.

Environmental Assessment for Shanghai Urban Environment Project
3.3.3.3 Improvement on Treatment and Disposal of Solid Waste
The implementation of the SHUEP will form an overall process management system for handling
solid waste from its source to the ultimate disposal. Sorting collection, containerised transport,
recycling and reuse, sanitary landfill, incineration, biochemical treatment, and etc. will be applied.
By 2010, the sorting collection of domestic refuse in the urban area of Shanghai would be near to
98%, recycling for reuse 20%, compacting collection 95%, thus, the transport of refuse will be
basically sealed and containerised. In the whole city proper, the reuse of domestic refuse could be
expected to reach* 70%, non-hazardous disposal 100%, and 75% night soil disposal would be
conveyed by sewers.
By 2010, the sorting collection of domestic refuse in the rural area of Shanghai would be near to
98%, recycling for reuse 15.2%, compacting collection 80%, and the collection system of refuse
will be all established in all villages. In the whole rural area, the reuse of domestic refuse could be
expected to reach 75.1%, non-hazardous disposal 100%, and 50% night soil disposal in towns
would be conveyed by sewers.
3.3.3.4 Improvement on Ecological Condition
Greening and landscaping will form a variety of beautiful scenery. It will help Shanghai improve
bio-diversity and create a better eco-environment.
1) To alleviate "heat island" effect in city
Because of the thermal pollution from industrial and scarcity of green space, the city proper has a
serious "heat island" effect regardless of the waterways such as the Huangpu River, Suzhou Creek
traversing. The vegetation, especially big trees, is a useful tool to regulate the air humidity and
temperature, prevent strong wind, and improve local climate. According to a research on the effect
of Yanzhong Green Space in the downtown in 2001, it has been found that the green space is
capable of alleviating the intensity of local heat island by decreasing 0.6°C of the air temperature.
Greening project of APL Programme will increase the green coverage and improve the local
eco-environment. It will play an important role in alleviate local "heat island" effect and create a
comfortable living surroundings.
2) To beautify the city
The Old City and others are the areas mixed with industries, residents and docks at present, and are
all planned to renew. The APL Programme will improve those areas for providing good
entertainment and relaxation sites for the citizens and visitors.
3) To clean air and reduce noise
Green plants have a unique function in respect to cleaning the air. They can reduce dust, absorb
toxic or harmful gases, and release healthy negative ions. A green corridor can also reduce noise as
well.
3.4 Assessment of Social Impact
3.4.1 Potential Impact of Land Acquisition
1) To accomplish the renewal of areas which land is to be acquired
(APL EA Draft En 0202.doc)
- 22 -



Environmental Assessment for Shanghai Urban Environment ProJect
The land to be acquired in the projects in APL Programme is mostly in the areas, which are old and
mess with lack of availability of good infrastructure and green space in Shanghai. In the new round
of Shanghai Master Plan, they have been prioritised to rehabilitation. The implementation of the
APL Programme will speed up this plan to realise and enable those areas to shift their functions
more rational.
2) To raise land value
It is estimated that the price of real estate may several folds increase in such as Old Town Greenbelt
Ring, NW Park and their vicinity. The steep rising for the price of properties along the riversides
due to the successful project of Suzhou Creek Rehabilitation and establishment of Lujiazui
Financial and Trade Centre are convincing examples.
3.4.2 Impact on Living Standard of Resettlers
In the proposed sites to be acquired in the projects of APL Programme, most residents are living in
old houses, and some even in sheds and shacks. Incomplete infrastructure, dense population and
environmental degradation result in unsatisfactory living conditions for residents. All of the
industrial polluters, together will those old residential houses will be relocated. The residents will
move into some larger residential areas, constructed according to the city master plan.
Taking a certain residential area in the Old City as the example, the living condition there is
compared with another one for resettlement located between Inner Ring Road and Outer Ring Road
(Table 3-2).

It is illustrated there will be a great improvement regarding living environment and housing,
however, education, communications, health care and entertainment facilities will be not so
convenient and facilitated as the downtown areas. However, the overall living conditions for the
resettlers will be greatly improved.
3.4.3 Impact on Population Distribution
The SMG is making efforts to optimise the population structure and improve citizen's quality.
Reduction of the population density, particularly in the downtown area, is one of the tasks. The
resettlement at such as Old Town Greenbelt Ring is in line with this trend. There will be a great
change regards to the population distribution and structure in this area.
3.4.4 Impact on Scenery Views
The Old Town Greenbelt Ring and upgrading of wastewater management and solid waste
management systems are also parts of the comprehensive development project along the Huangpu
River. The Huangpu River is the major waterway in Shanghai. The waterway rehabilitation
together with greening and landscaping programme has been prioritised in the Shanghai Master
Plan. This is the first largest landscaping project in Shanghai for the new century. This is a
planning at higher standard and higher level.  The waterways will create a harmonious and
dynamic environment for Shanghai. According to this master plan, some key industrial polluters
like shipyards, steel plants, and construction material plants will be removed. The areas along the
Huangpu River will be redeveloped into a relaxation and recreation site for visitors and citizen. It
will become a key scenery spot and a symbol of Shanghai in the 2l1 5 century. It will be no doubt to
support and promote the realisation of this ambitious plan by providing with adequate
infrastructure through implementation of the APL Programme.
3.4.5 Impact on Cultural Property
A city's architecture is the showcase of its history. The Old Town Greenbelt Ring in the APL
Programme, for instance, is to be located in the old town, which represents the unique tradition of
Shanghai. Yu Garden and Chenxiang Pavilion are the state-level preserve properties, together with
10 city and district level ones, and some tradition residential areas and shops. Surrounded by Yu
Garden on the north, Wen Miao (Culture Temple) on the south, and Shuyin Pavilion on the east, this
whole area is preserved as a small traditional old town of Shanghai. In particular, the proposed site
of the Old Town Greenbelt Ring will be closely linked with the Bund Historic and Cultural Style
Preserve Zone and its opposite, the Lujiazui Financial and Trade Zone, across the Huangpu River.
The Bund is an outstanding architectural showcase, and nearby Shanghai General Post Office is
another state-level preserve building. Lujiazui Financial and Trade Zone is the demonstration of
the city's recent development since 1990. It is a picture of modem Shanghai. From Yu Garden, Old

Environmental Assessment for Shanghai Urban Environment Project
Town, the Bund, to Lujiazui, and other development projects along the riversides of the Huangpu
River, it is a track of five-hundred-year development and history of Shanghai.
Therefore, the APL Programme will actively promote the historic and cultural property
preservation in this area.
3.4.6 Impact of Policy and Institutional Reform
The development target of SHUEP in APL Programme will come true through a package of
measures in policy, institutional and financial reform, and physical project investment. The reason
why the World Bank wishes to provide loan to SMG depends to a considerable degree upon the
innovation capacity in respect to policies, institutional arrangement, and Shanghai's wish to
become an example for other cities in China. Just as the preparation for the APL project, the SMG
is continuing to change from a direct service provider to more of a regulator and facilitator, and to
implement the project according to market operational mechanism. Shanghai is seeking for
domestic and overseas outstanding enterprises, qualified personnel and capital to participate in
development of projects, and to promote the construction for urban environment in Shanghai.
Therefore, the APL strategic framework will certainly give Shanghai impetus to further reform and
opening.
Besides, the APL is an appropriate vehicle to improve the management of the Huangpu River
catchment. A catchment should be managed as a whole regardless of its extent across the
administrative boundaries. There has been a lot of lessons by the responsibilities for water
resources management split among different agencies. The APL Programme may be expected to
give impetus to change such a situation. It could greatly benefit the whole catchment.
3.4.7 Influence on the World Bank
Now, Asia-Pacific region is taking a leading role in the global economic development. China has
become one of the countries with highest economic growth and highest international investment.
Shanghai is the leading city and the most dynamic areas in China. Selecting Shanghai to
implement the APL Programme would be a sensible choice.
Shanghai, as so called a "dragon's head" of the Chang Jiang, has an enormous influential capacity
to the inland part of China. As Shanghai is situated at the middle of the western coastline of Pacific
Ocean, it can play an example role in developing countries all over the world through the
widespread exchange with the global community for the latest 200 years. The SMG is one of the
strongest local governments possessing market consciousness and highest efficiency. All of these
would be of great advantage to ensuring the security of World Bank loan, and to managing the
implementation and finally to realising the development targets of APL Programme.
Therefore, the implementation of APL Programme in Shanghai could further promote the influence
of APL itself as well as the World Bank in the world. It can become a bridge to connect the whole
world.

4.2 Shanghai Sewerage Project III
Since 1 980s the SMG has reinforced the input on environrmental programmes, the SSP-I and SSP-II
were completed, improving the water quality of the Huangpu River and Suzhou Creek. But
sewages from some areas of Suzhou Creek catchments and parts of Huangpu, Baoshan, Zhabei
Districts as well as part of Pudong Area still discharged to the Huangpu River, to damage the water
environment and to restrict the sustainable development of Shanghai. In order to improve the
drainage system, solve the problem of mixing of sewage and storm runoff, the SSP-III is expected
to effectively solve the problem of handling the sewage of North and Northeast parts of urban area.
It also provides the solution to the intercepted sewage from tributaries of Suzhou Creek and
Hongkou Gang and Yangpu Gang areas, and then improves water quality of Suzhou Creek,
Huangpu River and their tributaries.

4.2.2 Main Elements of the SSP-III
1) Sewage collection system:
Trunk sewer and link sewers in sub-service areas, main storm runoff drainage system in Baoshan
District.
2) Construction of Minxing Sewage Treatment Plant, or No.2 Zhuyuan Sewage Treatment Plant:
Wastewater treatment - sewage treatment plant;
Wastewater discharge - outlet pumping station and outfall.
4.2.3 Sewage and Storm Runoff Collection System and Diversion
4.2.3.1 Area A
1) Collection system and pipe alignment
Most part of this area is using separate system. In order to avoid re-excavating the roads due to
laying sewage sewer and storm drainage sewer not at same time, the construction of both systems
will carried out at same time.
It will serve the area south of Yunzao Bang (including the area in Zhabei District which has not
been served by the SSP-I and the Suzhou Creek tributary catchment interception project).
(APL EA Draft En 0202.doc)
-27 -



Environmental Assessment for Shanghai Urban Environment Project
Total service area is 55.56 km2 with population of 0.5511 million and design capacity of 0.2334
million m3/d.
134.63 km trunk sewer will be build, meanwhile 3 sewage pump stations at Minzhu, Wenshui and
Zhangmiao will be build. Of 136.45 km storm draining pipes, 82.515 km will be laid in the near
future whilst the rest 53.93 km will be in the far future. Of total 16 storm drainage pump stations,
10 ones will be built in the near future.
2) Sewage discharge
To utilise the spare capacity of the SSP-I and Shidong Kou Sewage Treatment Plant, they may
receive 0.40 million m /d and 0.60 million m3/d of sewage flows respectively.
4.2.3.2 Area B
1) Discharge option
There are two options for discharge in the Area B:
Option 1: On-site treatment by construction of a sewage treatment plant with a capacity of 0.50
million m3/d to meet the requirement for Class 2 of Shanghai Integrated Wastewater Discharge
Standard and then discharge its effluent into the Huangpu River.
Option 2: Conveyance of the sewage in the Area B to Zhuyuan where the Zhuyuan No.2 Sewage
Treatment Plant to be facilitated to meet the requirement for Class 2 of Shanghai Integrated
Wastewater Discharge Standard and then discharge its effluent into Chang Jiang
2) Collection system and pipe alignment
Service area of the collection system is Changbai, Kongjiang, Da Dinghai, Zhoujiazui and Fuxing
M2
Isle drainage systems, east of Yangpu Gang, covering an area of 11.37 km  with population of
0.307 million and design capacity of 1.63 million m3/d.
6 trunk sewers are to be laid with a length of 9.54 km in total, and a sewage pump station at the
Jiamusi Road is to be built.
If the sewage is sent to Minxing Sewage Treatment Plant, 3.554 km long trunk sewer in 3,500 mm
in diameter will be built whereas 13.524 km trunk sewer in 2,700 - 3,500 mm in diameter for the
Option 2.
4.2.3.3 Sewage Collection System in Area C and Pudong New Area
It will be implemented by near-term and long-term steps:
Near-term: the secondary trunk sewer (including pump station) is designed based on projected
sewage flow, 5 pieces with 34.2 km long in total and 7 midway lifting pump stations will be
constructed.
Long term: the tertiary trunk sewer with 248.28 km long in total for all towns, and 8 local pump
stations are to be built.
4.2.4 Wastewater Treatment Plant
A sewage treatment plant is to treat the sewage from the Area B. There are two options: on-site
treatment and diversion to outside. On-site treatment is to build a sewage treatment plant beside the
(APL EA Draft En 0202.doc)
- 28 -



Envirornmental Assessment for Shangha Urban Environment Pro'ject
Huangpu River and release its effluent into it. Diversion to outside is to collect the sewage and
send to Zhuyuan, then discharge into Chang Jiang after being treated.
Siting of the sewage treatment plant has two options: Minxing Sewage Treatment Plant and
Zhuyuan No 2 Sewage Treatment Plant.
4.2.4.1 Design capacity
The design capacity is 0.5 million m3/s with average dry weather flow of 5.79 m3/s, dry weather
peak flow of 7.52 m3/s and minimum flow of 3.47 m3/d, and storm peak flow of 21.26 m3/s.
4.2.4.2 Design Strength of Influent and Effluent
Based on the survey of sewage water, the strength of influent is proposed. The effluent strength
;should be in compliance with Class 2 of the Shanghai local discharge standard (Table 4-3).
Table 4-3 Design strength of influent and effluent of the sewage treatment plant
Item          CODcE    BOD  |   SS    NH3-N    TP

Class 2 of local standard (mg/L)  120  30  30    10     1.0
4.2.4.3 Sewage Treatment Plant Site Alternatives
Option 1: The location is selected at the area east of Jungong Road, north of Minxing Road, south
of Gongqing Nursery, west of planned road (Fig. 3).
Option 2: The location of the plant is selected at south side of Zhuyuan No.1 Sewage Treatment
Plant. The land is under reservation by Zhuyuan No 1 Sewage Treatment Plant (Fig. 3).
4.2.4.4 Sewage Treatment Process Alternatives
1) Minxing Sewage Treatment Plant
Secondary treatment process is adopted, plus nitrification and phosphorus removal, the effluent is
to be disinfected prior to being discharged and partly be recycled.
There are three options for the sewage treatment scheme:
a. A2/O nitrogen and phosphorus removal technology is adopted, the effluent reused for landscape.
b. High efficiency sedimentation pond + bio-filtration treatment, half underground.
c. High efficiency sedimentation pond + bio-filtration treatment, underground.
2) Zhuyuan No 2 Sewage Treatment Plant
A2/0 nitrogen and phosphorus removal technology is adopted.
4.2.4.5 Comparison of Alternative Technologies
Two different treatment technologies at the same location is compared (Table 4-4).
It seems that both sewage treatment technologies all could meet the requirement for «Shanghai
Integrated Wastewater Discharge Standard>), thus both are feasible.

Environmental Assessment for Shanghai Urban Environment Project
4.2.4.6 Discharge Outlet
1) Discharge into Chang Jiang
The sewage collected from the Area B is to discharge into Chang Jiang at Zhuyuan, just south of the
existing outfall of the SSP-1. A head tank would be combined with that of the outlet pump station
into one located at inside 100 m from of the dyke. The discharge mode would be beside the bank.
When an emergency discharge happens, a deep outfall would be used.

The outlet is to be set below the average level split into 2 - 3 ones with 30 m interval in between.
The size of the outlet is 3,500 mm in diameter. During the dry season, the average flow rate is at 3
- 4 m3/s each. When an emergency happens, the sewage is to directly discharge into the Huangpu
River via a bypass.
4.2.4.7 Treatment and Disposal of Sludge
The sludge generated in the process of high efficiency sedimentation plus bio-filtration treatment
will be 271.4m3/d with water content of 65%; whilst in the process of A2/O                nitrogen and
phosphorus removal will be 186 m3/d with the same water content.
Sludge treatment will use mechanical concentrating and dewatering process; and its disposal will
use barges or vehicles to send to a sludge treatment works at Bailong Gang.
4.2.5 Environmental Measures Planned
4.2.5.1 Treatment of Stink
1) Minxing Sewage Treatment Plant
(APL EA Draft En 0202.doc)
- 31 -



Environmental Assessment for Shanghai Urban Environment Project
The foul smell generated from the sewage treatment plant will be collected and treated with
bio-filtrator, and finally emitted through a 16 m high stack. The biological technology could
decompose pollutants in the waste gas into CO2 and H20 so as to avoid causing the secondary
pollution. The installation of this process will need certain area but can be under the ground and
covered as the top keeps the same level of the ground.
2) Pumping Stations
The grid basin in the pumping stations will be covered with shelters, in which the foul stink gases
would be concentrated and drawn to the treatment cabins before exhausted into the air.
4.2.5.2 Noise Prevention
1) Minxing Sewage Treatment Plant
All the installations are to be set under the ground thus to mitigate the noise disturbance.
2) Pumping Stations
Basically, submersible pumps are to be used in the pumping stations. The noise intensity of such
kind of pumps will be 15 dB(A) lower than that of ordinary axial pumps. Meanwhile, the sound
insulated doors and windows of the pump houses are to be used to greatly reduce the impact of
noise to the surroundings.
4.2.6 Total Loading of Pollution Derived from the SSP-II1
The release of pollution loads from the SSP-III has been estimated (Table 4-5).
4.3 Laogang Landfill Expansion Project IV
4.3.1 Status of Previous Laogang Landfill Projects
The Laogang Landfill started to construct in 1985, and its Phase I was commissioned in 1990 with
an operation area of 1.5 km2. Since then, the Phase II was completed in the end of 1993, and the
Phase III was in the early 2000. The total investment for the three phases amounted to 320 million
yuan RMB, and the Landfill has covered an area of 3.2 km2 and a disposal capacity increased from
2,500 t/d to 7,500 tJd as a whole. At present, its actual capacity has reached 9,500 t/d. It is the only
scaled landfill site for disposal of 90% of domestic refuse in Shanghai.
In the present time the Laogang Landfill has not met the requirement for a sanitary landfill site.
The major problems are as follows:
no reliable anti-permeating measures in the landfill site;
* the treatment of leachate incompliant with a discharge standard;
* serious stink due to the exposure to the air when handling refuse on docks and filling work
area;
no separate drainage system facilitated to finished landfill cells;
* water quality in the harbour basin polluted;
* offensive smell emitted from leachate treatment system and regulating pond;
no overall plan for the utilisation of the finished landfill site.

Enviromnmental Assessment for Shangai Urban Environment Projlect
In 2001, the annual wastewater discharge from the Laogang Landfill amounted to 3.865 m3, in
which, 0.365 million m3 were leachate, 36,500 m3 were domestic wastewater, and the rest was the
amount for changing the water in harbour basin. The annual pollution loads amounted to 1,091 t of
CODCr, 279 t of BOB5, 0.16 t of petrol, 151 t of NH3-N, and 817 t of SS.

were hydrogen sulphide, and 0.206 million m3 were ammonia.
4.3.2 Briefing of the Laogang Landfill Expansion Project IV
Laogang Landfill Expansion Project Phase IV for disposal of 4,900 t/d of domestic refuse is to be
located on the reclaimed shoals east of the previous landfills (Fig. 4). The proposed area will cover
3.36 million m2 (4,200 m from north to south, and 800 m from east to west) to fill up from +2 m to
+13 m with a volume of 35 million m3. Its expectation life will be 18 years. The total investment
will be 973.389 yuan RMB, and it will be completed and commissioning in 2004.
The technical standard of sanitary landfill is taken as technical requirements for construction and
operation of the Project. Vertical barrier and HDPE liner as an artificial anti permeating system
will be built to enclose the operation area, and a separate drainage system and leachate treatment
system will be facilitated as well. The way of transporting garbage will gradually be containerised.
The filling operation uses such processes of compacting by layers, daily covering, interim covering
and finishing covering after slope filling. The gas will be exhausted in the early stage, and
collected and utilised to evaporate the leachate later.
The refuse to be disposed of by the Project is mainly domestic from the urban area, and could be
something additional from  rural area and residues from  reusing process after 2005.  The
composition of domestic refuse to be disposed of could be different from time to time (Table 4-6).

4.3.3  Project Scheme
4.3.3.1 Layout of the Phase IV Landfill Zone
The base of landfill zone is at a level of about 3.4 m above the datum enclosed by a cofferdam with
a top elevation of 8.0 m. The area of filling zone is over 320 ha.
The main road system consists of the roads in direction from east to west and from north to south
connected with a circular round on the top of the cofferdam to form a complete round line. The
{APL EA Draft En 0202.doc)
- 34 -



Environmental Assessment for Shanghai Urban Environment Project
landfill site is by those roads divided into four sub-zones each with two anti-permeating subzones
in a size of 500 m (N-S) x 800 m (E-W) The anti-permeating subzones are separated by E-W dikes
with 5.0 m in width on the top at the elevation of 4.5m and 1:2 side slope, and N-S dikes with 1.0 m
in width on the top at the elevation of 4.5m and 1:2 side slope. Thus, an operation unit is in size of
500 m (N-S) x 133 m (E-W).
4.3.3.2 Anti-Permeating System
Vertical permeation prevention is to build a vertical barrier enclosing the sites of the Landfills I, II
and III. The barrier will be based on a natural horizontal anti-permeating layer existing at the
elevation of -10 m to effectively cut off the connection of inside contaminated groundwater from
the outside.
Horizontal permeation prevention is structured in a consecutive order from bottom to top as
follows (Fig. 5): groundwater collecting system, 20 cm thick sand drainage layer, up to 25 cm thick
clay layer, base of anti-permeating film (400 g/m2 long fibre polyester geo textile with a
permeability K< x IO-12 cm/s), 2 mm thick HDPE anti-permneating film, covering layer (400 g/m2
long fibre polyester geo textile), duct for draining leachate, 10 cm thick earth net, 20 cm thick sand
layer, and 10 cm thick gravel layer.
4.3.3.3 Separate Drainage and Storm Runoff Diversion
Three keys in the separate drainage for wastewater and rainwater in the Phase IV are to control that
during operation, after the formation of interrnediate covering, and after finished covering. Thus,
the measures to be taken are to drain the runoffs in the underground intruding the layer beneath the
anti-permeating layer, in the base between filled and unfilled units, on road surface, on the
intermediate covering surface and finished covering surface.
4.3.3.4 Options for Discharge of Storm Runoff
Along the outside of Phase III cofferdam, an open ditch is to lay for collecting the runoff from the
finished covering of the previous three Phases into an open drainage channel discharging to the
East China Sea. The runoff generated in the four units from north to south of the Phase IV will be
collected by gravity into either open ditches along the outside of Phase III cofferdam or the inside
of eastern cofferdam of Phase IV, and then released into the open drainage channel.
4.3.3.5 Filling Operation and Covering
1) Transport of refuse
Based on the current situation, the transport of refuse will be in compatible mode by using
,containers and in bulk. Having left docks, transfer trucks will be driven eastwards along the trunk
roads across the zones of the previous Phases. Then the trucks pass the roads on the unit separate
dikes via those on the main separate dykes and enter a filling operation unit to unload refuse.
2) Filling operation
The filling operation can be done in two working spots simultaneously. Three bulldozers at each
spot and three compacting rollers shared by three spots will be equipped. Bulldozers will spread
and level a 0.6 m thick single layer, and conduct primary compacting before a special compacting
imachine rolls 3 times to reach a dry compacting density not less than 0.6 t/m3 (corresponding to 1.1
*- 1.2 t/m3 of wet weight based on the present garbage composition). Then, refuse spreading and
4'APL EA Draft En 0202.doc)
-35 -



Environmental Assessment for Shanghai Urban Environment Project
compacting on the next layer will be repeated.
Corresponding to the three operational elevations (+4.5 m, +8 m and +13 m), the filling operation
will adopt a scheme to reach the final level through two stages. Thus, the loading can be increased
on the foundation stage by stage to suit the characters of lower bearing capacity and higher
subsidence in the filling zones, as well as to help reduce the wastewater generation and ease the
separate draining, collecting and discharging.
Refuse landfill operation at the first stage is accomplished in two steps, i.e., filling up to +4.5 m
elevation in the first step and then filling from +4.5 m to +8 m elevation in the second step. The
first step of filling operation (+4.5 m elevation) adopts pit-filling method while the second one
(+4.5 m to +8 m elevation) adopts piling method on an inclined plane.
The second stage of filling operation (+8 m - +13 m elevation) adopts piling method on a inclined
plane with 5 m thick refuse filling layer.
3) Covering
There are three types of covering in the refuse landfill process:
*  Daily covering - After the filling operation has been finished every day, daily covering
should be conducted with the material of degradable plastic membrane (degraded within
one year) by a special scroll mounted at the back end of the bulldozer as a laying tool.
*  Intermediate covering - When the first stage of landfill started from the bottom of a unit is
up to the top of the main separate dyke, the intermediate covering should be carried out
with a 30 cm thick compacted earth layer.
*  Slope piling and finished covering -  When the first stage of landfill is finished in a
landfill zone, the slope piling will be started until the final elevation of +13 m reached and
then a finished covering will be made.
The surface area of the final covering of the Phase IV will be about 2.80 million mi2. The top
covering will be 50 cm thick soil layer and 20 cm nutrient soil.
4.3.4 Environmental Measures Planned
4.3.4.1 Treatment and Discharge of Wastewater
It is an expansion project. Wastewater in the landfill could be from three sources: leachate from
filled units, leachate from the units of the Phase IV being filled, and washing water from docks.
The wastewater amounts to 2,600 m/d in total with average strength of 10,000 mg/L of CODc,.
2,500 mg/L of BOD5, 1,200 mg/L of NH3-N, and 500 mg/L of SS.
In the feasibility study report, it is indicated that the option by treatment to meet the Grade 3 of
,<Shanghai Wastewater Integrated Discharge Standard (DB31/199-1997)x) and then conve' to
Bailong Gang Sewage Treatment Plant has a predominant advantage in technical and economical
terms, and has recommended as the most suitable alternative for upgrading the leachate treatment
system in the Laogang Landfill Expansion Project IV. The recommended process is to build up two
sets of treatment facilities, each of which has a capacity of 1,300 m3/d.
Based on the existing system of oxidation pond, the wastewater will run through a regulating pond
(partially to be refilled), anaerobic biochemical process, A/O intra-cycling biochemical
(APL EA Draft En 0202.doc)
-36 -



Environmental Assessment for Shanghai Urban Environment Project
denitrification, chemical coagulation - coarse filtration - ultrafiltration and man-made wetland
system, and then the effluent will be conveyed to Bailong Gang Sewage Treatment Plant.
The expected effluent can meet the Grade 3 of the local standard.
4.3.4.2 Generation and Control of Stink
Food residues and rinds can account for two thirds of all the municipal waste in Shanghai. The
organic in household refuse in forms of protein, fat and polysaccharose such as starch and cellulose
may be fermented and decomposed by anaerobic micro-organisms in the course of garbage
collection, transfer, transport, and arrival to the docks at the Laogang Landfill. In the process,
offensive smelled gases are produced containing ammonia (NH3), CH3SH, H2S, (CH3)2S and etc.
Those gases will release in the processes of unloading and spreading whilst refuse entering the
landfill site.
Based on an experiment on the emission of foul smell from domestic refuse in Japan, the emission
strength of major substances would be at rates of 9.2 kg/d of H2S, 68 kg/d of NH3, 0.97 kg/d of
CH3SH from 2,000 t of refuse.
Presumably, 15% of the stink substances have dissipated during water transport, and 60% of the
rest would be concentrated released in the course of loading, unloading and landfill within about
seven hours and half. The foul gases can be herefrom estimated to emit during handling 4,900 tL/d
of refuse in rates of 1.53 kg/d of 112S, 11.3 kg/d of NH3, and 0.16 kg/d of CH3SH.
As compacting and covering will be done timely after refuse has been filled, the refuse exposure
area and duration can be reduced so as to control the emission of foul gases. It could be also helpful
to reduce the release of stink in the course of loading and 'unloading at docks whilst adopting
containerised transport.
4.3.4.3 Generation, Control and Use of Methane
The filled domestic refuse can generate gases mainly containing methane (CH4), carbon dioxide
(CO2) and etc. (Table 4-7). The yield rate may be up to 48 m3 per tonne of refuse within five years,
and 25%, 40%, 20% 10% and 5% of the total would be released in the first, second, third, fourth
and fifth year respectively. Therefore, the yield of landfill gas in the operation period of the
Laogang Landfill Expansion Project IV can be estimated to be in the range of 0.035 - 0.235 million
m3/d with the fifth through fifteenth years being a peak period (Table 4-8).
Table 4-7 Major constituents in landfill gas

In the initial operation period of the Landfill, the gas yield would be rather lower. In this case,
(APL EA Draft En 0202.doc)
-37 -



Environmental Assessment for Shanghai Urban Environment Project
natural exhaust of the gas may be a good choice. Wells in a size of 800 mm in diameter will be laid
crisscross with an interval of 40 m centred by perforated PVC pipe in DNI50 and filled with
crushed stone of 32 -100 mm in diameters. They are built up in sections with top of the wells and
the gas leading pipes being 0.5 m and 1.0 m above the covered surface respectively. As designed,
on top of the wells there will be mounted a kind of burning device for landfill gas. The collected
flammable gas will be automatically ignited through an automatic detector when a certain
concentration is reached. It will exhaust and bum out the landfill gas in time so as to remove the
stink and ensure the safety in filling operation as well.
Three years after the commissioning of landfill, the landfill gas generated in the covered landfill
units could be put to use. The PVC collection mains will link all the landfill gas pipes. The
collected gas will be conveyed to a purifier by a compressor and used for evaporating the landfill
leachate.
4.3.4.4 Control of Flies
In the course of transport of refuse, using compacting sealed trucks can control the flies' breeding.
Killing flies at the Laogang Landfill will use special processing measures assisted with some
pesticides. The process will use concentrated filling within subzones and cover it in time to reduce
the exposure of refuse and cut off the course of flies' breeding.
4.3.4.5 Control of Noise
Noise of the Phase IV would be mainly from loading and unloading activities at docks, running of
transfer trucks from docks to landfill sites, and landfill operation.
The control measures can be by using equipment with lower noise, limiting operation hours,
avoiding idle running of machines so as to mitigate the impact on the surroundings of the landfill
site as possible.
4.3.4.6 Isolating Green Belts
As the Phase IV is a consecutive project of the previous Phase III, the arrangement of isolating
green belts should be consistent with original plan. The kind of trees should well be selected such
as fast-growing tall trees, evergreens, and coniferous trees alternating with broadleaf trees.
4.3.5 Management of Site Closing and Its Ultimate Use
The stabilisation period of landfill refuse is rather long and may extend for about 20 - 40 years.
The practicability of ultimate using closed site will closely rely on the management of site closing
during the stabilisation period. According to the location of Laogang and the requirement for
development of green spaces in Shanghai, the ultimate use of the Phase IV area should be as a
nursery base and a recreation park. Thus, it is better to work out a greening plan as early as possible,
and support the vegetation restoration programme in the period of management of site closing.
4.3.6 Total Loads of Pollutant Emission
The annual loading in the Phase IV is summarised as follows: 0.949 million m3 of wastewater flow,
228 t of CODIr, 87.3 t of BOD5, 19 t of NH3-N; 4.3 t of H2S, 0.4 t of CH3SH, and 34.9 t of NH3

4.4 Upper Huangpu Protection Wastewater Management (Fig. 6)
4.4.1 Jinshan Sewerage Project
Jinshan Sewerage Project is located in the eastern of Jinshan District of Shanghai. The project
includes sewage discharge trunk sewer, 4 sewage pump stations, sewage discharge outlet and
Xinjiang secondary sewage treatment plant. Total investment is 17.14864 million yuan RMB
(1997 price).
The project collects the industrial wastewater, domestic wastewater and a small amount of animal
wastewater. The service area is 30.48 km2.
Xinjiang sewage treatment plant occupies an area of 4.45 ha and adopts A-A-O sewage treatment
technology. The final design treatment capacity is 100,000 m3/d.
4.4.2 Fengjing Wastewater Treatment Plant
The Fengjing Wastewater Treatment Plant will be built in southwest ofjunction of Huanfeng Road
(N) and Qixian Jing, east by Qixian Jing and opposite Fengjing railway station.
'The whole project is separated by three steps. Phase I, design capacity of the wastewater treatment
plant is 14,000 m3/d covering 2.47 ha; 28,000 m3/d covering 5.27 ha in next phase.
The project belongs to municipal and environmental infrastructure. Its total investment is 87.2
million yuan RMB, among which 31.04 million yuan RMB for the plant for wastewater collection
system. The construction period is 2 years.
The project includes two parts: the wastewater plant and wastewater collection system. The plant
'will construct inlet pump, sedimentation tank, anaerobic tank and oxidation ditch, secondary
sedimentation tank, chlorinating contact tank, and sludge thickening tank and balancing tank,
residual sludge pump, dewatering machine house, and other auxiliary buildings. The collection
system consists of sewer and lifting pump station.

Environmental Assessment for Shanghai Urban Environment Project
CODcr and NH3-N in the wastewater are main impact factors in the project. In nornal operation,
the concentration increment of CODCr and NH3-N would be 0.7799 mg/L and 0.0014 mg/L, 4.15%
and 7.0% of concentration at present respectively.
After the project commissioning, most of wastewater being discharged into the river without any
treatment will be collected and treated in the new plant. Thus, the gross pollutant will be cut down
and water environment will be improved. It will contribute to the protection of the Upper Huangpu
catchment.
Whilst in an abnormal operation, the pollution load of the discharge into river will be increased.
The concentration increment of CODcr would be 1.253 mg/l, 6.66% of that at present. The
increment of unionised ammonia would account for 9.5%. Thus, the water intake of Fengjing
Brewery in its upstream may be influenced.
4.4.3 Fengxian South Sewer Wastewater Treatment Plant
Fengxian South Sewer Wastewater Treatment Plant consists of four parts: 1) a wastewater
treatment plant; 2) collection sewer; 3) six pump stations; 4) an outlet
The wastewater treatment plant will be located in end of No.4 Road in FengxianDistrict. Distance
to #6 pump station is about 900 m. It is a rectangle area with 480 m from east to west and 339 m
from north to south. On the land of the proposed site, there are now the shrimp breeding ponds.
Total investment of the plant costs 199.6 million yuan RMB, and the land area is about 16.3 ha.
Wastewater treatment process is aeration circulation oxidation ditch (Carrousel 200 oxidation
pond). Sludge is to be treated by three steps: thickening, dewatering and sending out to disposal in
short term, whilst digestion being under consideration for future.
Wastewater to be collected is from industries, animal farms and households, and the domestic
origin accounts for 58% and the rest is from industries and animal farms.
Solid waste will be produced from screening, sand sedimentation and secondary sedimentation
(Table 4-10).

5   Description of the Environment
5.1 Physical Environment
5.1.1 General
Facing the East China Sea, Shanghai is the most populous city in China, and situated at 31 '1 4"N of
latitude and 121 '29"E of longitude in the front of an estuarine delta of Chang Jiang (Yangtze River).
The estuary borders in the north, Hangzhou Bay in the south, and the sea in the east (Fig. 1 ).
The city had a total area of 6,340.5 km2 at the end of 2000, 0.06% of China's total territory. The
city extends about 120 km from north to south and nearly 100 km from east to west. Shanghai has
an urban area of 3,924.24 km2 and rural area of 2,416.26 km2. Its land area covers 6,219 km2 and
water area runs 122 km2. Chongming Island is the third largest island in China, covering an area of
1,041 km2.
Shanghai is formed by silting up gradually under the reciprocity between the estuarine river and the
tide. Its topography is plain, morphology is simple with the altitude higher in the Southeast and
lower in Northwest between 3.5 - 4.5 m or even up to 5 m somewhere. The-average elevation is
3.87m above Wusong Datum. The groundwater table is relatively high, in general in the range of
0.5 - 1.5 m.
Shanghai has a subtropic monsoon climate with distinct four seasons. In general, it is mild and
humid in spring, hot and much rainy in summer, clear and crisp in autumn, and cold and less
rainy/snowy in winter. Its annually average temperature is in range of around 15°C with extremes
of over 40°C and about -I 0°C. The annual precipitation reaches about 1,100 mm, 60% of which fall
in the period from May to September. Especially, in June and July every year, here is a so-called
plum raining season which may last for over 40 days at most whilst reaching a maximal 370 mm of
rainfall in total. The prevailing wind directions are from SE in April through August, from NW in
November through February next year, and are changeable (mostly from NE) in March, September
and October. The annually mean speed of wind is about 3.0 m/s.
5.1.2 Aquatic Environment
5.1.2.1 General
Netted with many rivers and lakes, the Shanghai area is known for its abundant water resources,
with the water area accounting for 11% of total.
Chang Jiang estuary is an enormous water body subject to irregular semi-diurnal tide. It is
dominated by fresh water of an average river flow of 29,000 m3/s. Regards tidal levels, for
example at Wai Gaoqiao, the highest tidal level is 5.64 m and the lowest one is -0.43 m. The
average duration of flood tide is 4.55 hours and of ebb tide is 7.86 hours. With vast water-and-air
interface, it has very favourable reaeration capability. In general, it is in good water quality though
the river has received considerable amount of pollution loads along the way from upstream towards
the East China Sea. The changes in silt load follow seasonal and tidal pattems with an average
level of about 0.5 kg/m3 and an uppermost level reaching 5.0 kg/m3. Thus, the water uses of Chang
Jiang estuary as drinking water sources are limited by rather higher silt load, especially in flood

season, and several incidents of saline intrusion during drought period.
The water of Hangzhou Bay is brackish and unsuitable for drinking. Its silt load is obviously lower
than that in Chang Jiang estuary. It is generally in good condition in exception of higher nitrogen
and phosphorous contents.
Both of those water bodies are ecologically important sustaining aquatic life forming a major
fishing ground in China.
The Huangpu River traverses the city proper and its drainage area covers over 5,000 km2 in
Shanghai in a form of waterway network in the alluvial plain. It is the last tributary of Chang-Jiang,
and is situated in the downstream of Taihu Lake Basin. About 50% of the Lake water are released via
it with an annually mean river discharge flow of about 318 m3/s.
The Huangpu River is classified as a lake-original tidal river and is also subject to a type of
irregular semi-diurnal tide. At Wusong Kou, the mouth of the Huangpu River, the highest tidal
level has ever reached station 5.74 m in the record whilst the average one is 3.28 m. The average
tidal range is 2.27 m with the biggest one of 4.48 m. The flood tide lasts 4 hours and 33 minutes
whilst ebb tide does 7 hours and 52 minutes in average. About 12 hours and 25 minutes form a tidal
cycle. Tropic storm and extreme-cold air also influence its tidal levels.
At the mouth, the maximum inflow in flood tide reaches 12,100 m3/s, and the maximum current
velocity during flood tide is 1.8m/s.
It has been suffering from water pollution caused by human activities to some extent to threaten its
rational uses. As tidal-influenced, the river current is reversible back and forth for several times
before the water can empty into Chang Jiang estuary. When low flow comes from upstream, or
even higher tidal level meets from downstream to hinder a free release of the river water, the
wastewater discharged into the river will be retarded around the received reaches much longer to
result in undesirable consequences of pollution build-up. The tidal inflow from Chang Jiang
estuary, however, has somewhat alleviated this problem, in particular, in the lower reaches of the
Huangpu River.
Though the Huangpu River is not the only water resources available in Shanghai, however, it has
been playing a very important role in sustaining the socio-economic development of Shanghai. The
river system has multiple functions including providing as water sources for agricultural, industrial as
well as domestic uses, as navigable channels for communication and transport, as a water body
receiving runoff as well as industrial and domestic effluents, etc.
5.2 Biological Environment
5.2.1 Terrestrial Ecosystem
5.2.1.1 Vegetation in Wetland
The intertidal zone at the south of Chang Jiang estuary grows commonly. Because of the influence
of reclamation, the higher tidal zone is relatively narrow. There are rivers crossover on the land and
a lot of pools as well. So wetland vegetation includes intertidal zone vegetation at the foreland of
Chang Jiang estuary and aquatic vegetation in freshwater. Intertidal zone vegetation is dominated
by reed community, and etc. They grow at the foreland of Chang Jiang estuary. Aquatic vegetation
(APL EA Draft En 0202.doc)
-43 -



Environmental Assessment for Shanghai Urban Environment Project
in freshwater includes foxtail alga community, goldfish alga community, black alga community,
duckweed, purple float, hollow amaranth, water lettuce, water hyacinth, etc. They grow at rivers
inside of the levee and pools, rills, ditches, etc.
5.2.1.2 Artificial Vegetation
The most common artificial vegetation in this area is artificial forest belt along the road, shelterbelt
along the bank and farm, and shelterbelt along the coast, etc. Generally, sycamore and metasequoia
are planted. And poplar, Cinnamomum camphora, elm are also planted.
Secondary, it is afforestation plants in the town. There are some areas in the park and near the
houses for afforestation plants. The most common plants are Cinnamomum camphora, Magnolia
grandiflora L., cedar, Chines rose with red autumnal leaves, Cape jasmine, metasequoia, larch,
holly, coral tree, etc, which are artificial cultivated.
The crop community includes foodstuff, nursery, vegetable and cole, etc.  Generally, the
community is a combination of foodstuff and economic crop.
5.2.2 Aquatic Ecosystem
5.2.2.1 Aquatic Ecosystem in Chang Jiang Estuary
There are nearly 170 species of freshwater fish, salt-fresh water fish, saltwater fish,
marine-freshwater migrant and marine fish at the area.
There are nearly 1 00 species of benthic organisms. The dominant species is corbicular of Mollusca
and Branchiura sowerbyi, Limnodrilus hoffmeisteri of Annelida.
There are nearly 120 species of zooplankton, such as Cladocera, rotifer, decapods, amphipoda,
euphausiid shrimp.
5.2.2.2 Aquatic Ecosystem in the Huangpu River
*The common species of phytoplankton are Melosira in the project area of the Huangpu River. The
common species of zooplankton are Labidocera eucnaeta at Wusong Kou area; and there are a lot
of attached biota which are enduring to pollution at the mouths of Yunzao Bang and Suzhou Creek.
The dominant species of benthic organisms in Wujing section of the Huangpu River are Tubifex,
and Limnodrilus of oligochaete in annelid.
5.3 Socio-Economic Environment
5.3.1 Population
By the end of 2000, Shanghai had a total population of 16.74 million (including the floating
population) and the registered population had 13.22 million, 1% of total population in China. In
2000, the average population density in the city stood at 2,084 inhabitants per square kilometre,
whilst 2,897 in the urban area.
The city's natural population growth rate was -1 .9%o in 2000, with the birth rate reaching 5.3%o and
inortality rate 7.2%o.

5.3.2 Industries
5.3.2.1 Primary Industry
In 2000, the agricultural sector in Shanghai was reported to have an added value of 8.165 billion
yuan RMB, an increase of 16.8% over that of 1995. The total agricultural output value reached
21.65 billion yuan in 2000, 17.9% rise over that in 1995 and representing an annual growth rate of
3.4%.
During the 1995 - 2000 period, the proportion of planting in the total agricultural output value
decreased from 42.6% to 41.5% and that of animal husbandry went down from 44.7% to 40.3%,
while fisheries rose from 12.5% to 17.5%. The output value of vegetable, fruit, flower, poultry,
fresh milk production and special breeding also reported remarkable increase during the period.
5.3.2.2 Secondary Industry
In 2000, Shanghai realised an industrial added value of 199.160 billion yuan, jumping 58.9% over
1995 according to the comparable prices, and representing an annual growth rate of 9.7%. Of the
total, heavy industrial sector made up for 120.659 billion yuan while light industrial sector
accounted for 78.501 billion yuan.
'I'he city's total industrial output value reached 691.536 billion yuan, a whooping increase of 78.6%
over 1995 according to the comparable prices, and representing an annual growth of 12.3%.
Shanghai's six pillar industries, namely the automobile industry, the electronic and
telecommunications equipment industry, the iron and steel industry, the petrochemical and fine
chemical processing industry, the power station complete sets and parts manufacturing industry
and the home electric appliances industry, have further consolidated their dominance by
technology renovation and product upgrading and maintained the role as the powerhouse in the
local industrial economy. Their total output value hit 329.2 billion yuan in 2000, up 18.7% from
the previous year and accounting for 53.6% of the city's total industrial output value. The added
value of the six pillar industries totalled 54.728 billion yuan, making up 71.1% of the city's total
from the industrial sector. In the same year, the six pillar industries generated a combined profit of
23.368 billion yuan, growing 41.2% from 1999 and accounting for 61.4% of the city's total
industrial profit.
5.3.2.3 Tertiary Industry
Shanghai has adhered to the policy of giving first priority to development of the tertiary industry,
actively restructuring the secondary industry and steadily improving the performance of the
primary industry. As a result, the city has made salient progresses in the strategic restructuring of
the local industries and has reported rapid development of its tertiary industry focusing on finance,
trade and information technology. The city's industrial structure has been further optimised.
In 2000, the output value of the city's tertiary industry reached 228.26 billion yuan, an increased of
100% over that of 1995 according to the comparable prices.
The output value of the tertiary industry for the first time accounted for more than 50% of the city's
GDP in 2000, with the ratio of the city's primary industry, second industry and tertiary industry
readjusting from 2.5:57.3:40.2 in 1995 to 1.8:48:50.2.

Environmental Assessment for Shanghai Urban Environment Project
5.3.2.4 Employment
Since early 1990s, the number of labourers employed in different economic sectors has been
changing with economic restructuring. The number of labourers working in the secondary industry
dropped from 59.3% of the city's total workforce in 1990 to 42.1% in 2000. Meanwhile, the figure
with the tertiary industry continued to increase, jumping from 29.6% in 1990 to 46% in 2000. The
tertiary industry has provided a growing number of jobs for surplus labourers, helping to ease the
city's unemployment problem.
5.3.3 Infrastructure
In the last decade starting from the beginning of 1 990s, Shanghai invested a total of more than 310
billion yuan in its urban construction projects, representing an average annual growth of 33%, and
the capacity of the infrastructure has been drastically enhanced (Table 5-1).

In 2000, Shanghai achieved the phase goal of getting rid of black and stink for the main stream of
Suzhou Creek. The quality of the main water body of the Huangpu River had also somewhat
improved. The total pollutant discharge volume had declined and the content of TSP and NOx in
the air dropped by 7. 1% and 8. 1%, respectively, from the previous year.
In 2000, Shanghai added 828 ha to its public green space, built 30 pieces of large greenbelts in size
of over 3,000 m2 each, and opened seven new parks, including the Century Park and the Hongqiao
Central Park. At the same time, 350 ha of green space had been added to the newly completed
residential areas.
By the end of 2000, green area made up 22% of the city's urban area, 1.7% up over that of the
previous year. The per capita green area reached 4.6 mi2, 0.98 M2 up.

53.4 Living Standard
The average expense of each inhabitant in Shanghai in 2000 was 11,546 yuan RMB. The sum
of wages was 61.453 billion yuan whilst the average one was 1 5,420yuan, 9% higher than that in
the previous year. The net income per capita in the rural area was 5,596 yuan, 2. 1% higher than that
in the previous year. The popularity of coal gas has been 100%. There have been 55 beds in
hospitals, 81 health care professional staff and 38 doctors per every 10,000 inhabitants. There are
4.6m2 green space per capita, 1.0 m2 more than that in the previous year.
5.4 Environmental Problems
5.4.1 Water Pollution Loadings
Based on an investigation on water pollution sources in 2000, there are 55,979 pollution sources in
Shanghai. The volume of wastewater reaches 5.04 million m3/d with CODcr loading of 1,704 t/d
and amnmonia nitrogen loading of 123 t/d. According to statistic data, the proportion of the
wastewater from industrial, municipal, and animal farm pollution sources is 40.6%, 58.7% and
0.7% respectively, whilst the CODCr loadings from those sources are 22.0%, 61.5% and 16.5%, and
ammonia nitrogen loadings are 21.7%, 68.9% and 9.4%, respectively.
Statistics depending on discharge routes show that the wastewater from 15,340 pollution sources is
centralised to discharge amounting to 1.45 million m3/d. Wastewater from 6,860 pollution source
goes into sewage treatment plants with a volume of 0.77 million m3/d. Wastewater from 33,779
pollution sources goes directly or via municipal discharge outlets into the surface water in a
quantity of 2.82 million m3/d without being properly treated.
5.4.2 Water Pollution
The wastewater discharge has seriously polluted the main waterways in Shanghai. Based on the
classification of water quality, the Upper Huangpu Water Source Protection Zone is classified as
Category II, the Sub-Zone as Category III, while its lower reaches as Category IV. The
observations have shown that water quality of almost all functional zones has not always met with
their functional requirements. For instance, the water quality at Songpu Bridge is basically at
Category III, whereas that at Wusong Kou reaches Category IV but some indices are inferior.
5.5 Component Specific Environmental Condition
5.5.1 Environmental Condition at Laogang Landfill
5.5.1.1 General
The proposed Laogang Landfill is located at Laogang Township in Nanhui District about 60 km
away from downtown. It adjoins Zhaoyang Farm and Binhai Township, is 3 km from Laogang
Town on the west and 3 km from Dazi Canal on the south. The nearest residences are located 1,000
m away.
The Expansion Project IV will lie at reclaimed shoal, which elevation has been at 3.8 m above
datum with an outward slope of about 1/1,000. As the shoal was formed in the last decade, there
are no buildings on it, and merely a few human activities such as gathering in reeds etc. Thus, there
are no cultural properties at all. According to the reference about planning for nature preserves in
(APL EA Draft En 0202.doc)
-47 -



Environmental Assessment for Shanghai Urban EnVironment Project
Shanghai, this site is not a forest nor a kind of nature preserves.
5.5.1.2 Ambient Air Quality
It has been found by monitoring that H2S and NH3 concentrations in the air at the Laogang Landfill
site and its vicinity were partly incompliant to the standard in the rang of about 30% - 90% and 6%
- 13% higher than their relevant limits in maximum, and their foul smell intensity reached Classes
2.3 and 1.3 respectively. The methane concentration at outlets of the leading pipe were all less than
5%, in compliance with the requirement set in <Technical Standard for Sanitary Landfill of
Municipal Solid Waste (CJJ17-88)>>.
5.5.1.3 Quality of Surface Water at Laogang Landfill Site
In the water body at harbour where refuse is handled, the concentrations of total phosphorus and
CODCr are incompliant to Category V of the surface water quality standard, and that of NH3-N at a
chemical enterprise even once reaches up to nearly triple limit level. In respect to the water body in
Chang Jiang estuary at Laogang Landfill, except the concentrations of NH3-N, petrol and total
phosphorus are slightly over the limits, that of CODCr, BOD5 and cyanides are all in compliance
with the Category II requirements of surface water quality standard.
5.5.1.4 Quality of Groundwater and Soil at Laogang Landfill Site
The groundwater at Laogang is brackish and very hard. In the groundwater, chlorides, NH3-N and
hardness are almost all much higher than their limits, whilst PV (permanganate value) and As are
60% and 10% respectively incompliant to Category V of «Groundwater Quality Standard
(GB/T14848-93)>>. The others such as pH value, fluorides, cyanides, volatile phenols, LAS, Cu, Zn,
Hg, Cr, Cd, Pb and Ni are all in compliance.
It is observed that in the soil surrounding the Laogang Landfill, As, Cr and Cd are in compliance
with Class I of <<Soil Environmental Quality Standard (GB 15618-1995)»>, whilst Hg, Pb, Cu, Ni
and Zn are in compliance with Class 2

6   Analysis of Alternatives of the Project
6.1 Analysis of Sewage Treatment Plant Siting Alternatives
6.1.1 Comparison of Project Scale and Investment
6.1.1.1 Capital Cost Comparison
Because of difference in treatment processes and overall layouts of the sewage treatment plants, the
project scale of construction and equipment installation differs greatly (Table 6-1).
Table 6-1 Cost comparison of different treatment options

It can be seen that if only take the cost for construction, installation and trunk sewer into account,
the investment cost of Zhuyuan No 2 Sewage Treatment Plant is the highest among the four options.
It is because that the plant at Zhuyuan needs to build trunk sewer from Puxi to Pudong. The cost of
the plant at Minxing Road which adopts high efficiency sedimentation plus bio-filtrator and all
under the ground will be ranked the second.
Actually, the plant at Minxing Road could need less land, shorter sewer to be laid and fewer
midway pump station to be built than that of Zhuyuan.
6.1.1.2 Gross Investment Comparison
According to the Feasibility Study Report, the option of sewage treatment plant to be built all under
the ground at Minxing Road has been recommended. The gross investment comparison between
recommended option and Zhuyuan option can be seen in Table 6-2.
Regards the gross investment, the cost of Minxing Sewage Treatment Plant is 250 million yuan
RMB higher than that of Zhuyuan No.2 Sewage Treatment Plant. This is mainly because that
Minxing Sewage Treatment Plant is to be located at the bank of the Huangpu River, as the
resettlement cost within the Outer Ring Road is much higher than that of Zhuyuan No.2 Sewage
Treatment Plant, which is to be located beside Chang Jiang, out of the Outer Ring Road with much
lower land price.

6.1.1.3 Running Cost Comparison
The estimation of running cost has shown that the unit total cost and runmning cost of Minxing
Sewage Treatment Plant are higher than that of Zhuyuan Sewage Treatment Plant (Table 6-3), i.e.,
the running cost 0.016 yuan RMB or 3.8% higher. One thing should be mentioned is that in the
estimation of running cost, the transport cost for sludge has not been included. If it has been
covered, the running cost of Minxing option should be further higher

6.1.2 Compatibility Comparison with Planning
6.1.2.1 Consistency with Planning
The implementation of a sewage treatment plant is to reduce or eliminate the water pollution.
Therefore. two alternative sites are consonant with relevant requirements of "Shanghai City Master
Plan", "Shanghai Enviromnental Protection Plan", "Shanghai Water Environmental Rehabilitation
and Protection Plan, and the Tenth Five Year Programme" as well as "Shanghai Sewerage System
Plan".
6.1.2.2 Compatibility Differences between Different Siting
Regards the compatibility of regional plan, Minxing Sewage Treatment Plant would be located at
Wujiao Chang Town of Yangpu District where are mainly industries and warehouses in the region
now. According to regional plan of Yangpu District, the land is reserved for industries. Now in the

Environmental Assessment for Shanh Urban Environent Project
Comprehensive Redevelopment Programme of Riversides along the Huangpu, Jungong-Xianying
Road is the northern end, about 0.5 km far from Minxing Road. According to the planning, the
scope may further extend along the Huangpu River stretching both southward and northward. In
the Comprehensive Redevelopment Programme of Riversides along the Huangpu, the focused
development region of Yuanpu Bridge will be built into a distinguishing riverside settlement with
traditional style, and a science-education office park. Landscape will emphasise the line of sight
corridor effect to waterside, and combine the historic architecture with bank public facilities to
enrich the landscape of both sides. There really exists some incompatibility between the sewage
treatment plant construction and regional plan.
Zhuyuan No 2 Sewage Treatment Plant is to locate at the south side of Zhuyuan No I Sewage
Treatment Plant where the land has been reserved the future development. In the view of the
function there in the regional development plan, the sewage treatment plant construction there is
relatively coordinate with the plan.
6.1.3 Capacity Comparison of Effluent Receiving Water Bodies
6.1.3.1 Capacity of Chang Jiang Estuary at Zhuyuan Section
The watercourse of Chang Jiang is divided into South and North Branches by Chongming Island.
The South Branch is divided into South and North Channels by Changxing Island. Zhuyuan is
located between Wai Gaoqiao and Xiao Jiuduan.
Split of river flow by South Branch is much greater than that of North Branch, 98% - 99% of water
volume descends along South Branch. The flow in South Channel changes between 34.7% -
63.7%. The inflow tide may reach about 3.25 billion mi3, whilst up to 4.5 billion m3 in spring tide.
Flood tide in South Channel lasts a period of 4 hours and 50 minutes (usually 4 - 5 hours) whilst
ebb tide does 7 hours and 35 minutes (usually 7 - 8 hours). The ebb slack lasts for a quite short
time. The increase of ebb current velocity after the flood slack is very slow, and the maximal
current velocity occurs after about 3 hours.
Residual current in South Channel is all bearing toward sea in the flood season. The residual
current in the surface layer in main channel can reach 37 cm/s, while that at the northern flood
trench is only 12.4 cm/s. The residual current in the drought season is rather complicated, i.e., that
in main channel is bearing seawards, whilst that in flood trench and southern shoal is upstream.
There may appear plane circulation on some circumstance, and the surface residual current in main
channel may be in the range of 7.5 - 29.8 cm/s, lower than that in flood season, depending upon the
reaction between river discharge flow and tidal flow. It is benefit for shift and transform of
pollution if an outfall is to set at where the residual current bears outwards.
Based on long term observations and the data collected during 1997,1999 and 2000, all have shown
that the recent baseline of water quality at Zhuyuan section of Chang Jiang is basically in
compliance with Category II of the surface water standard. It means that there exists rather large
capacity available. It has also been indicated that nowadays the discharge of sewage from the
SSP-1 amounting to about 1.40 million m3/d,
6.1.3.2 Capacity of Lower Huangpu River
Influenced by tide of Chang Jiang estuary, the flow in water system of the Huangpu River is

- 51 -



Environmental Assessment for Shanghai Urban Environment Project
reversible. The maximal tidal inflow entering Huangpu River through Wusong Kou is 12,100 m3/s,
and the largest tide outflow is 6,000 m3/s, among which about 90% of water released are tidal flow.
Daily mean gross tidal inflow is 112 million mi3. Annual inflow may reach 42.3 billion m3, which
account for 80% of gross water volume of the Huangpu River. It means that 80% of surface
resources is the inflow via Wusong Kou from Chang Jiang.
Pollution load in the Huangpu River water system was the receiving of about 4.0 million m 3/d of
sewage in the 1980s. Nowadays, the load has been reduced to less than 2.80 million m 3/d.
Recently, Suzhou Creek has now been under rehabilitation, interception of the wastewater in the
catchment of its six tributaries will soon be completed, the rehabilitation of Yangpu and Hongkou
Gangs is going on, in the Upper Huangpu cut-down of the pollution is carrying on, and in Pudong
the construction of collection system has started. Based on all of these actions, it could be expected
that in next three or four years, the pollution load may be reduced to below 1.0 million m3/d, and the
environmental status there could be much better. After several years, there could have be possible
for receiving effluent which has been subject to secondary biochemistry treatment and phosphorus
removal and denitrification. Though discharging effluent into the Huangpu River may be affected
by tidal flow, according to mathematical modelling, under the most unfavourable hydrological
circumstance, the trace up distance is still 15 - 17 km left from the upstream Water intake, so that it
would not affect the safety of the drinking water source upstream.
There are some issues on effluent discharge into the Huangpu River that may draw necessary
attention to. The mass point trace back doesn't mean the upper limit of the influence. It may be
valuable to think about the possibility of releasing the effluent during the ebb tide, and the direct
abstraction of river water in the lower reaches for water supply should be controlled.
6.1.4 Preliminary Conclusion of Siting Alternative Comparison
According to the analysis, it is feasible in terms of environmental capacity to discharge the treated
effluent into both water bodies at Zhuyuan of Chang Jiang and Minxing Road of lower reaches of
the Huangpu River. In addition, when relevant measures are to be taken for minimising the
unanticipated impacts, the both alternatives would be environmentally acceptable. They could
contribute in a similar way to the improvement on the water environment in Shanghai.
It has not been yet as a conclusion that was derived from an overall and comprehensive analysis.
Further elaboration on it would be worthwhile, in particular, in terms of economic aspect and
planning consideration. Though the alternative of Minxing plant is compatible with Shanghai City
Master Plan, however, some incompatibility might exist between the sewage treatment plant siting
and the regional plan. The Comprehensive Redevelopment Programme of Riversides along the
Huangpu is an ambitious plan launched by the SMG, thus all the development projects shall be in
line with this core task.
6.2 Analysis of Wastewater Treatment Options for Refuse Landfill Leachate
Here are three proposed alternative sets for treatment of leachate:
* Alternative I: treatment to meet the Grade 2 of «<Shanghai Wastewater Integrated Discharge
Standard (DB31/199-1997)>> (100 mg/LofCODcr, 30 mg/LofBODs, 15 mg/L of NH3-N),
and then directly discharge to the sea;
(APL EA Draft En 0202-doc)
- 52 -



Environmental Assessment for Shanghai Urban Environment Project
*   Alternative II: treatment to meet the Grade 3 of the Shanghai local standard (300 mg/L of
CODCr, 150 mg/L of BOD5, 25 mg/L of NH3-N), and convey to Bailong Gang Sewage
Treatment Plant prior to being discharged to the sea;
*   Alternative III: treatment to meet the Grade 3 of «(Pollution Control Standard for Domestic
Refuse Waste Landfill (GB 16889-1997)>> (1,000 mg/L of CODcr, 600 mg/L of BOD5), and
then convey to Bailong Gang Sewage Treatment Plant prior to being discharged to the sea.
The Alternative I uses a process that needs rather complicated system management and
maintenance, and its investment and operating costs are relatively higher, but it has less
environmental impact. The Alternative II uses a process that needs generally complex system
management and maintenance, and its investment and operating expenses are moderate. Its
effluent can directly enter the sewage treatment plant so that there is almost no impact upon the
local surface water. As the Alternative III uses a simple process, it is quite easy to manage and
maintain, and it needs lower investment and operating cost, but its effluent strength could be two to
three times over the requirement for connecting to the sewage treatment plant Table 6-4).

*   This is the first part of the expenses for the treatment system and drainage system. The figures in the brackets are

A comprehensive analysis of the three alternatives with respect to environmental protection
requirement, reliability of operational management and control of construction and operation cost
indicates that the Alternative II is the optimal one. It has also been recommended by the feasibility
study report as a renovating scheme for leachate treatment system of Laogang Landfill IV.
The capacity of Bailong Sewage Treatment Plant in short term will be 1.20 million m3/d of dry
weather average flow. At present, its sewerage network is receiving about 1.00 million m3/d of
wastewater. It means that it is able to receive the flow of 2,600 m3/d from this project. The effluent
strength of the leachate treatment facility could basically meet the requirement for the influent of
Bailong Gang Sewage Treatment Plant. Therefore, discharge of the effluent from leachate
treatment system into the Bailong Gang collection system would be feasible.
The additional pollution loading to Bailong Gang system would be about 780 kg/d of CODIr, 390
kg/d of BOD5, and 65 kg/d of NH3-N, i.e., only increasing 0.22%, 0.27% and 0. 18% respectively.
It would impossibly be affecting the treatment effect there.

Environmnental Assessment for Shanghai Urban Environment Proj'ect
7   Assessment of Environmental Impacts of the Project
7.1 Environmental Impact of Shanghai Sewerage Project Phase III
7.1.1 Impacts on the Huangpu River and Chang Jiang Estuary
7.1.1.1 Impact of Effluent on the Huangpu River
When the effluent enters Minxing Road reaches of the Huangpu River, it goes back and forth with
tidal current, and is gradually diluted, migrated, transformed and degraded during the course of
movement. According to calculation by mathematical model, the farthest trace distance would not
affect Daqiao water intake in the dry season with 17 - 20 km left from Daqiao (hydrological
occurrence of 90%). It means that it must have no impact on the upstream water intake. Minxing
Road reaches are situated at 14 km away from Wusong Kou, 8.5 km away from Yangshupu
Waterworks, 11.5 km away from the mouth of Suzhou Creek, 18 km away from Nanshi
Waterworks. The effluent can quickly be diluted after having entered the Huangpu River.
In the scenario of 90% occurrence during dry condition, after having discharged 7.52 m3/s of the
effluent, the largest concentration increment of CODcr at Yangshupu Waterworks is 3.01 mg/L and
that of BOD5 is 0.75mg/L; whilst at Nanshi Waterworks that of CODc, is 2.86 mg/L and that of
BOD5 is 0.7 mg/L.
7.1.1.2 Impact of Effluent on Chang Jiang Estuary at Zhuyuan
When the effluent enters Chang Jiang estuary at Zhuyuan, it will be mixed with river water, and
some particulates in the effluent will be collided with those in river water, and then a series of
'bio-geo-physicochemical reaction process such as adsorption, exchange and complex will happen.
It is a kind of purifying process. Lingqiao emergency water intake is a key object there (about 8 km
upstream from Zhuyuan proposed outfall). According to estimation by the model, in very dry
season when annual flow is 7,500 m3/s (occurrence is over 95%), the CODcr increment at Lingqiao
is some 0.24 mg/L, BOD5 about 0.055 mg/L, NH3-N 0.046 mg/L, and total P 0.00185 mg/L. It
would have no impact on Lingqiao water intake even by the effluent of physicochemical treatment
in SSP-I combined with the effluent of the SSP-III.
It seems that either at Chang Jiang estuary or at Lower reaches of the Huangpu River, the discharge
of effluent subject to secondary treatment would unlikely cause big impacts. Comparably, the
capacity at Chang Jiang estuary is higher than that at the Huangpu River, however, the length of
trunk sewer will be shorter if the sewage treatment plant is to site at the Huangpu River that reveals
its advantage.
7.1.2 Impacts on Air and Acoustic Environment
7.1.2.1 Impacts on Ambient Air
As Minxing Sewage Treatment Plant adopts underground sealed structure, foul gases is to gather
and treat. When hydrogen sulphide and ammonia have met the limit set in "Stink Pollution
Emission Standard", they are to discharge by a 16m high stack. After calculation, under the
circumstance of common climate, pollutant concentration is lower than the requirements of
"harmful pollutant in ambient in residential area air permit once highest concentration", impact on
(APL EA Draft En 0202.doc)
- 55 -



Environmental Assessment for Sharthai Urban Environment Project
ambient environment is very small. But H2S concentration will be incompliant to the standard
within 40 - 250 m from the source, whilst NH3 within 40-70 m under inverse temperature.
It is uncertain that if Zhuyuan No 2 Sewage Treatment Plant adopts measures to gather and treat
foul gases. But if not, then the sludge disposal procedure needs 960 m distance for hygiene
protection, and three surrounding farmer village will come under impact. If adopting treatment
measures and pollutant removal rate reaching 90% and above, then the hygiene protection distance
could reduce to 250 m, and those three surrounding villages would not be impacted by sludge
disposal procedure.
7.1.2.2 Impacts on Acoustic Environment
As Minxing Sewage Plant adopts completely sealed structure, according to an analogy analysis of
an underground water pump house of the People's Park with similar structure, machinery noise
from the sewage treatment plant would basically have no impact on ambient environment.
Zhuyuan No 1 Sewage Plant is located on the north of the proposed Zhuyuan No 2 Sewage
Treatment Plant, the west of which is Haixu Road, the east is Yantang Road, there are some
residents on the south. According to the modelling, on daytime, the noise contribution of its inflow
pump house to the south and north factory boundary, air blower room, sludge dewatering machines
and surrounding factory boundary all could exceed Class 2 limit value (50 dB(A)) in "Industrial
Enterprise Boundary Noise Standard", with the highest exceed 9 dB(A). It reveals that some
machine noise of Zhuyuan No 2 plant can not meet the requirements within the factory boundary.
7.1.3 Impacts on Social Environment
There are difference in the social impacts between Minxing and Zhuyuan No 2 Sewage Plants
(Table 7-1). It can be seen that the floor space, borrow land area and road impacted are all greater at
Zhuyuan than that at Minxing. Moreover, as Minxing Sewage Plant is located in a build-up region
in Puxi, while Zhuyuan sewage plant is in rural area in Pudong, therefore, the latter involves
cultivated land acquisition and dweller resettlement, but less in enterprise resettlement.

7.1.4 Impacts on Sludge Transport
No matter what the location selected is, sludge disposal is through machinery thickening,
centrifugation dewatering and then sent to Bailong Gang sludge landfill.
The difference between two location is the difference of transport distance. If it is at Minxing Road,
then adopting vehicle transport for distance of 32km, passing through major traffic line of Shanghai,
making a round trip will take 2 hours. If it is at Zhuyuan, it is 16 km away from Zhuyuan to Bailong
Gang, the transportation distance could shorten one half, so that the transport could take shorter
time. Therefore,just for the sludge transport, the impacts of Minxing Road option would be greater
than that of Zhuyuan option.
7.2 Environmental Impact of Laogang Landfill Project IV
7.2.1 Impact on Ambient Air
As organic contents in the refuse to be disposed of in the Laogang Landfill Expansion Project IV
could be about 13% decreased from that of present one, and the measures of compacting layer by
layer and timely covering would also be taken, the diffusion of foul pollutants could be reduced to
some extent. Meanwhile, farther distance between the landfill operation spots and the residential
areas could further alleviate the impact.
Estimated by computation, the concentrations of H2S and NH3 at residential area 1,000 m leeward
could be in compliance with their relevant standard limits in the case of either average wind
velocity or breeze, but in the case of fume, incompliance incident may locally occur for a spell.
Although the landfill units of the previous phases have been already filled and finished with
covering so as to ease the release of stink gases whilst the Project IV is put into operation, however,
the intensity of foul gases could be at a slightly perceptible level in the condition of breeze during
summer time at residential areas 1,000 m away.
In respect to the influence of waste gas emission from the operation machines, the concentrations
of S02, NOX, and TSP at residences 1,000 m leeward could still be in compliance with Class 2 of
National Ambient Air Quality Standard.
7.2.2 Impact on Surface Water
After commissioning of the Laogang Landfill Project IV, 2,600 m3/d of wastewater generated will
be treated and its effluent will be diverted to Bailong Gang Sewage Treatment Plant. The pollution
impact on the surface water at Laogang section of Chang Jiang estuary and other local water bodies
could, therefore, be basically avoided.
As the implementation of the Laogang Landfill Project IV will take over problems existing in
systems of the previous phases, the efficiency of wastewater treatment could be enhanced and the
effluent would be diverted to Bailong Gang for further treatment. It could result in dramatic
reduction in pollution loading and notable progress in eliminating the direct discharge of leachate
only treated by oxidation pond without compliance at present at Laogang.

Environmental Assessment for Shangha Urban Enviuonment Pro'ject
7.2.3 Impact on Groundwater
The observation indicates that the refuse landfill leachate from the previous three phases has caused
influence on the surrounding groundwater to certain degrees, as there has been no anti-permeating
measures available.
In the Project Phase IV, anti-permeating measures will be adopted so as to prevent effectively the
groundwater from being contaminated by the landfill leachate. The vertical barrier to be built to
enclose the landfill site of the previous three phases could effectively halt the horizontal movement
of the leachate. As there has been no anti-permeating liner available on the bottom of the existing
landfill site, a vertical permeation of the leachate could still occur. Along with the ageing of the
filled refuse, leachate strength could be lowered so that the impact on groundwater may be eased.
7.2.4 Impact on Soil
In domestic garbage there are waste batteries, fluorescent tubes, dyestuff, paint, and etc. containing
heavy metals. After such wastes were disposed of in the landfill, the contained metals could be
gradually transformed into a kind of soluble cation or anion complex compounds under the reaction
with weakly acidic organic. It will result in soil contamination along with the landfill leachate
enters the soil.
The observations in the period from 1994 through 2001 indicate that in the soil around the Laogang
Landfill site, contents of the heavy metals tend to increase whilst all are still in compliance with
Class 2 of soil quality standard without degradation. In the Project IV, anti-permeating measures
will be taken, the contamination of heavy metals to the soil through the leachate may be effectively
prevented. Thus, further contaminating the soil may be unlikely.
7.2.5 Impact on Ecosystem
The Laogang Landfill Expansion Project IV is located in a reclaimed shoal, in which, though part
of the habitat has been polluted by the leachate from the previous phases, the destruction of
vegetation and the migration of birds could be an irreversible consequence. Beyond this area, the
vast and constantly growing shoal could, however, compensate for it, and in its vicinity there also
have been sizeable shoals, plus the broad Jiuduan Sha Wetland Nature Preserve just opposite
located. It seems that this Project would unlikely bring about obvious impact on the wetland and
rare birds in Shanghai.
In the filled area of the previous three phases, only some kind of weeds in voluntary community has
occurred, and no indication of birds' and other animals' return has been found. Promoting the
planning and implementation of the ecological restoration and re-cultivation as well as
compensating the ecological demands of habitants and nature may ease the environmental
pressure.
After the commissioning of the Project IV, the leachate generated from the previous phases will not
be discharged again so that the impact on the reclaimed shoal on the east could be minimised.
Though the storm runoff will still be discharged into the reclaimed shoal, the separate system could
alleviate the impact on it.
Once the landfill units have been filled, the direct pollution from the operation of landfill will not
(APL EA Draft En 0202.doc)
-58-



Environmental Assessment for Shanghai Urban Environment Project
exist basically. If the ecological restoration could start as early as possible, it would form an
important isolating belt to separate the Project IV from the residential area. In addition, more
advanced means of transport and landfill process will be adopted in the Project IV, the impact of its
operation could be much lesser.
7.2.6 Impact on Fly's Density in the Vicinity of Laogang Landfill Site
A routine monitoring has shown that a change in the fly's density is not notable though the disposal
amount of refuse at Laogang Landfill site is progressively increased. The fly's density is dependent
upon the operation spot, i.e., the farther the distance away from the operation spot, the lower- the
density. The fly's densities are not very much different in spring and autumn. The wind direction
has shown its remarkable effect on the fly's density, and on the south of the landfill site, it is more
affected than that on the north.
Referring to an experiment, by means of all measures to be taken in the Phase IV to reduce the
exposure of refuse to the air, at the operation spot where the fly breeds, the density may be
controlled within 2 ind./cage/d. Therefore, the influence of fly's breeding could be anticipated to
be much lesser.
73   Environmental Impact of Upper Huangpu Wastewater Treatment
7.3.1 Impact of Fengxian South Sewer Wastewater Treatment Plant
By now there have been 16,000 m3/d wastewater discharge into Hangzhou Bay from the existing
South Sewer, and the water quality of the receiving water body has still been in original level with
no indication of being polluted. It means that the condition of dilution and diffusion in Hangzhou
Bay is rather favourable for siting this outfall there.
Inorganic nitrogen is main pollutant in the water body of Hangzhou Bay. In the period from July to
November in 2000, monitoring results show that the content of nitrogen exceeded Class 3 of the
Sea Water Quality Standard in a rate from 12.5% to 18.8%. The dominant pollution factor is
inorganic nitrogen.
Pollution of heavy metals is slight, and Cu, Cr, Ni concentrations are lower than detection limited
and Zn concentration is lower than Class 1 limit.
7.4 Environmental Impact of Old Town Greenbelt Ring Project
7.4.1 Impact on Socio-Economic Condition
In general, the resettlement is proceeding smoothly, the proponent of the Project is carrying out the
resettlement in accord with relevant policies. Up to now, the resettlement has almost completed
and the inhabitants have moved and resettled according to a plan, and the budget has been available.
Basically speaking, the resettlement proceeded satisfactorily.
For most resettlers, the population density in the Old Town is too high to live, not only in terms of
tight living space, but also of lacking sanitary facilities. The resettlement may give them an
opportunity to improve their living condition. Though their new homes are rather far away
compared with that in the Old City, however, they have a choice to adopt a way of buying desirable
housing by themselves if the monetary resettlement mode accepted. As regards the units, the
(APL EA Draft En 0202.doc)
- 59 -



Environmental Assessment for Shanghai Urban Environment Project
resettlement may also give them an opportunity to reorganise for developing new channels for
business.
The social benefit of the project is distinct, i.e., improving inhabitants' living environment of the
Old City, boosting the tourism development of Yu Garden area, promoting area land value and
improving investment environment, etc.
7.4.2 Impact on Ambient Environment
The impact of the Old Town Greenbelt Ring Project on the air would only limited in the period of
building demolition and by other construction activities. The impacts could include fly dust, noise,
and inconvenient communication. Such impacts would be almost unavoidable for the construction
sites are located in so densely populous area. The only way for mitigation would be by careful
management of construction.
The eco-environmental benefit of the project are adjusting local climate, decreasing city heat island
effect, absorbing carbon dioxide, giving out oxygen, increasing the concentration of negative ion in
the air, absorbing toxic and harmful gases, decreasing dust content and capturing dust, etc.
7.4.3  Preservation of Cultural Properties
There are historic sites of Dajing Pavilion and Shanghai Bookstore as a revolutionary ruins in the
project area. They have been named as cultural preservation heritage by the SMG municipal
government. The project has fully considered the preservation and resettlement of those two
buildings in the initial stage of the project implementation. The measures to reserve Dajing
Pavilion is suitable, and the scheme that first removing Shanghai Bookstore and then rebuilding it
at other place is feasible.
7.4.4 Implication in Pest Management
The pesticides and fertiliser used by green land of the project have no distinctly impact on the
environment. Strengthening management and reasonably planting can effectively prevent plant
from harn of diseases and insect pests. Safe biological pesticide will be adopted once plant
diseases and insect pests occur. Special pesticide storehouse does not need to be built and insect
pesticide will not be used.

8   Public Participation
8.1 Public Participation in SSP-III
Most public think project is very essential, and the support rate is more than 73%, whilst at the
same time 32% public hold free and easy attitude for not knowing about the project.
66% persons express understanding of the impact in the construction period, and 72% public think
that they can overcome environmental problems such as traffic and noise.
37% public express complaint about noise from the operation of the project, 55% persons think
impact of foul smell can not be tolerated.
Of the affected inhabitants, 48% persons express that they are ready to move, 48% ones are ready to
accept monetary compensation and new dwellings, 52% persons still have some worrying about the
resettlement or did not express any of their opinion.
8.2 Public Participation in Laogang Landfill Project
An announcement about the Project was publicized by the client on Wen Hui Bao on the 29th
December 2001, as well as by the EA team on website of Shanghai Environment Online
(http://www/envir.online.sh.cn), and meanwhile a 24-hour telephone hot line has been opened.
The visitors to the website have reached over 50,000 ones, who are from more than 20 countries
within those following 20 days.
To conduct the public participation, three types were used: questionnaires, meetings, and
on-the-spot interviews. The interviewees were people who live or work in the vicinity and could be
affected, or staffs in local governments, or representatives of social organisations, or ordinary
inhabitants.
100 copies of questionnaires had been sent and 96% returned. Sexes, ages, educational levels and
occupations of the interviewees could well reflect the situation of the area.
Most of the interviewed villagers have rather well known this project and its significance. 63% of
the interviewees think it is necessary, 21% stand by and 57% understand this project, whereas only
8% don't support it. Most enterprises have all well known the main elements of the project as well
as its importance.
The public comments include:
*  The Phase IV should become an advanced sanitary landfill site;
*  Anti-permeating system should be facilitated in the landfill zones to prevent groundwater
and soil from contamination;
*  The leachate should be treated in compliance with standard prior to being discharged;
*  Timely covering will be necessary over the filled refuse to minimise the diffusion of stink
and fly's breeding;
*  A green insolating belt in certain width is needed around the landfill site so that the
influence of fly on the surrounding inhabitants could be lessened as possible.

8.3 Public Participation in Old Town Greenbelt Ring Project
The inhabitants and units in the area of the project generally support the implementation of the
project. Individuals and enterprises to be resettled hope that reasonable resettlement measures are
to be adopted, and transparency of the resettlement policies should be enhanced to resolve the
resettlers' worrying and the preserve the their interest. The inhabitant around the area of the project
requires the contractors to adopt practical measures to guarantee the normal running of requisite
facilities.

9 Environmental Management Plan
9.1 Mitigation of Environmental Impacts
9.1.1 Recommended Mitigation Measures for Shanghai Sewerage Project-III
In order to avoid occurring of potential environmental impacts during the course of construction
and operation, it has been reconimended for the mitigation measures that may use (Table 1 0-1 ).
9.2 Institutional Strengthening and Training
9.3 Monitoring
9.3.1 Monitoring Requirement for Shanghai Sewerage Project-III
Environmental monitoring in construction stage mainly includes three aspects, i.e., monitoring
pollution from construction activities, wastewater strength and flow, and receiving water quality.
During operation stage, the monitoring includes three parts, i.e., monitoring at dischargers, pump
stations and sewage treatment plant, as well as receiving water bodies.
Recommendation and requirements on the environment monitoring both in construction and
operation periods listed in Table 10-2 and Table 10-3.
9.3.2 Monitoring Programme for Laogang Landfill Expansion Project IV
A programme for the Landfill Project is necessary to make routine monitoring on foul smell and fly,
leachate, sludge and noise (Table 10-4). The sampling sites should be set following the process of
generation and migration of the pollutants, i.e., the sources, the outlets of treatment facilities, the
ecosystem in the landfill site, at the boundary and beyond.

Environmental Assessment for Shanghai Urban Environment Project
10 Conclusion
Phase I for APL Shanghai Urban Environment Programme is proposed to have four components:
Shanghai Sewerage Project Phase III, Solid Waste Management Project Phase I (including three
sub-components as Phase IV of Laogang Landfill, Food Waste Collection and Treatment Project,
Management Information System for Sanitation Facilities), wastewater treatment plants at Upper
Huangpu catchment (including three sub-components: WWTPs at Fengjing, Xinjiang and
Fengxian), and Shanghai Old Town Greenbelt Ring Project. It is expected that Phase I of APL will
be completed between 2002 to 2007 with total investment of 6.847 million USD, among which 2.5
million USD will be loaned by APL.
'The implementation of APL Phase I is in full compliance with the strategic objectives put forward
in the Shanghai City Master Plan approved by the State Council and it conforms to the core project,
the Comprehensive Redevelopment Programme of Riversides along the Huangpu, in Shanghai in
the 21st century. The APL Phase I will lay a solid basis for implementation of Shanghai City
Master Plan.
Siting of each sub-component is based on the location of existing environmental infrastructure as
well as future layout planning. Location for these components is reasonable.
When APL Phase I is completed, water treatment capacity in Shanghai will increase 714,000 m3/d.
Water environment in the Huangpu River and its tributaries will be effectively protected, and water
quality will be improved. In the middle and lower reaches, the water quality will reach Category IV
of national classification, while the upper reaches will achieve Category III. Regarding household
refuse, 90% will be sorted during collection, 64% will be conveyed by closed lorries, 49% will be
recycled or reused and the non-hazardous disposal rate will be over 95%. Shanghai will establish
an effective management mechanism over the solid wastes, from cradle to grave. As to old city
rebuilding, the Old City Park project will be a combination of heritage preservation and modem
development. Environmental objectives for APL Phase I is feasible and accessible.
Implementation of APL Phase I is ensured by a package of favourite policies, institutional and
financial support. APL Phase I will help the government in Shanghai to improve its roles in
planning and decision making, and it will attract much more qualified enterprises, talents and
capital to participate in the environmental infrastructure construction in Shanghai. APL Phase I
will push Shanghai toward further reforming in order to follow up with WTO practices.
Based on all the items mentioned above, it is concluded in this assessment that Phase I for Shanghai
Urban Environment Project in the APL Programme is feasible.
