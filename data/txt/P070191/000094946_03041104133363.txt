1. INTRODUCTION
1.1 Assessment Origins
Shanghai is a city with a glorious revolutionary history. Many revolutionary activities
have left behind precious relics and sites. While Shanghai is marching towards an
international metropolis and becoming an important center of finance, economy, trading and
seaport, these precious relics and sites should be protected satisfactorily as irreproducible
historical and cultural recourses.
The northern part of Old Hongkou takes up about 83.6ha. In this part, near Duolun
Road, Shanyin Road, Liyang Road and Luxun Park, there are lanes of old Shanghai fashions,
various contemporary building and precious relics and sites, which is one of the most famous
historical culture sites in China as well as in Shanghai.
According to the whole layout of Hongkou District, this Project-- Reconstruction of the
Contemporary Buildings under Protection near Liyang Road, will pay equal attention on
development and historical style and features protection to renovate the old buildings built in
1 920-30s into inimitable ones. After reconstruction through restoration and inner decoration,
their dwelling functions and using values will be highly raised.
The Project is located at Siping Road, Liyang Road and Baoan Road in the east;
Changchun Road in the west; North Xingjiaqiao Rd in the south; 138 Lane of Baoan Road
in the north with an area of about 9.36ha. Three Blocks, i.e. A, B, C blocks, are divided in
this Project. The total investment is I billion yuan.
It is required by the Environmental Protection Law of the People's Republic of China
and Management Regulations for Construction Project Environmental Protection to
implement environmental impact assessment (EIA) regulation for construction projects that
may produce impacts to the environment. According to the Category List for Classifying
Management of Construction Project Environmental Protection, an EIA report must be
compiled for the present Project.

1.3 Assessment Objectives
The objectives of the present environmental impact assessment are:
In the local area of the construction site, to survey the features of the natural and social
environment, to evaluate the existing environmental quality including air and noise, and to
analyze the compatibility of the project construction with the development plan of the local
area.
Based on engineering analysis and analogical comparison with similar projects, to
determine the characteristics of pollution sources generated in main production processes, to
find major pollutants and emission amounts, and to estimate emission amounts after control
measures being implemented.
To predict and evaluate the impact level and extent on air quality and noise within the
assessment area, during and after the construction project.
To evaluate the feasibility of the environmental protection measures, and to provide
control methods and suggestions for further pollution control and impact mitigation.
1.4 Scope of Assessment and Pollution Control/Environmental
Protection Targets
1.4.1 Assessment Level
This Project belongs to a real estate reconstruction program. After reconstruction, the
[SEPA-Tongji Research Institute of Environmental Protection Science and Technology]  -3 -



EA for Shanghai Hongkou District Liyang Road Old House Protection and Rehabilitation Project
major water pollutant -sewerage will be disposed into the Municipal Wastewater Pipelines
with daily amount of 192m3/d. There will be no remarkable noise producing sources in this
Project. The acoustic environment is mainly affected by traffic noises from North
Xingjiaqiao Road in south, Baoan Road in east and Changchun Road in west. According to
the character, pollutant discharge amount and environmental sensitive degree in this Project,
the assessment levels are determined as following:
(I) Atmospheric environment
According to the Engineering Analysis, the major air pollutants of the end emission of
this Project are NO2 and S02, produced when food cooking and gas burning. Because the
emission rate is not high and estimated emission strength is less than 2.5X 109m3/h, the
atmospheric environmental impact assessment for this Project is therefore determined as
Grade 3.
(2) Water Environment
The major items to be assessed for the sewerage of this Project are SS, NH3-N, BOD5.
CODCr. The sewerage will be drained into the Liyang Road Municipal Wastewater Pipelines
at the middle of this Plot and finally be treated to reach the Second Class Emission Standards
by the Quyang Wastewater Treatment Plant. Therefore, the present assessment only analyzes
the attainment situation of the sewerage to be disposed and as Grade 3.
(3) Acoustic Environment
This Project is located in a residential and commercial mixing area. According to the
classification in the Environmental Noise Pollution Prevention and Control Law of the
People's Republic of China, the Second Category is applicable to the present Project. Since
there is no remarkable noise producing sources in this Project, the acoustic environmental
assessment is determined as Grade 3.
1.4.2 Assessment Area
(1) Water Environment
The major pollutant is sewerage for the real estate construction project. So the
assessment point of wastewater discharge is selected at the discharge outlet of this Project to
enter municipal wastewater pipelines.
(2) Atmospheric Environment
As described, the major air pollutants of the end emission of this Project are NO2 and
SO2, produced when food cooking and gas burning. Because the emission amounts is not
high and have little effects on surrounding environment, the assessment area for air quality is
selected as a 2 X 2 km2 area surrounding the Project site.
[SEPA-Tongji Research Institute of Environmental Protection Science and Technology)  -4 -



EA for Shanghai Hongkou District Liyang Road Old House Protection and Rehabilitation Project
(3) Acoustic Environment
The major noise pollutants are from nearby traffic noises and during the period of
Project construction. Affected by the traffic noises from Xingjiabei Road in north, Baoan
Road in east and Changchun Road in west, the acoustic environmental assessment is
determined as the key issue and its assessment area is selected within lOOm extended from
the borders of this Project.
1.4.3 Pollution Control and Environmental Protection Targets
(1) The objective of water pollution control is to let the sewerage attain the emission
standards of the 3rd Grade of Wastewater Synthetic Emission Standards of Shanghai
(DB31/199-1997, before entering Quyang road municipal wastewater pipeline and then
treated in Quyang Wastewater Treatment Plant..
(2) The objective of air pollution control is to attain the emission standards for Grade 2
(GB3095 - 1996 )    functional zone; the target of environmental protection is the
community surrounding the Project.
(3) The objective of noise control is to attain the Grade 2(Grade 4 beside main traffic
line) in Urban Area Environmental Noise Standards (GB3096-93) and Category II standard
of Industrial Enterprise Borderline Noise Standards (GB12348-90) ; the sensitive
protection targets are those residents in and surrounding this Project.
1.5 Key Issues of Assessment
Respective to the features of this Project and the local environmental setting, the key
issues in the present assessment include:
(1) Engineering analysis:
(2) Existing environmental quality survey for ambient air quality and noise level;
(3) Environmental impact assessment for ambient air quality and noise level;

3. Survey of the Regional Environment of the Construct Project
3.1 Survey of Natural Environment
3.1.1 Geographic Location
Hongkou district is located in the north-east of Shanghai. It belongs to Baoshan country,
Shanghai country separately in Qing dynasty. The south area was kept away as American
Concession (later co-named as public concession with Britain after 1848. Hongkou district
was set in 1945 named after the name of the district and transferred to north Sichuan Road
district in 1956 then to Tilan Bridge district in 1960. It became the district of today after
transferred once more to the region of Jiangwan town of Baoshan country and Dabasi
(today's Dabaishu). The region locates in the north-east of Shanghai neighboring to the east
to Yangpu district at Dalian Road, Dalianxi Road, Handan Road and Yixian Road, looking
to the south over Pudong district and Huangpu district to Huangpu River, Suzhou River,
linking to the west with Zhabei district alongside with Henanbei Road, Luofu Road,
Dongbaoxing Road, Yujingpu, bordering to the north with Baoshan district to Sanmen Road.
It is about 23.48km2 wide and has permanent population about 860,000 along with floating
population about 140,000. There are 9 streets and one town in the district, so the location is
predominant and the traffic is convenience. It is a district that gathers commerce central,
trade central and center district.
The object of the project locates in the north district of the old Hongkou and is adjacent
to the commerce region in Sichanbei Road, east to Baoan Road and Liyang Road, west to
Changchun Road, south to Xingjiaqiaobei Road, north to lane 138 in Baoan Road. It is one
of the economical functional regions that will mainly develop in the future, viz. the organic
constituent of the functional region which included Sichuanbei Road-Duolun Road-Hongkou
soccer stadium.
3.1.2 Topography and River
Several riverway such as the branches of Huangpu River(Yujingpu, Shajing port,
Hongkou port) wander across Hongkou District making up of the advantaged natural
resource. The river system of Hongkou port is the maternal river of Hongkou. It is 21.6km
long and 376500 m2 wide within the district and comes across throughout the nine streets
and the one town in the whole district. At the same time, it is the main channel taking up the
task of flood prevention and waterlog exclusion in Hongkou, Zhabei and Baoshan district.

The pollution source and situations of pollutants producing are as follow.
(I) Wastewater
The main wastewater is living sewage up to 252.1m3/d after the project finished. It will
tally with the third class diffusion standard of Shanghai after collection and sent to municipal
sewage pipeline in Liyang. At last it will go to Quyang water quality purify factory. Pollutants
in living sewage and the diffusion amount are listed in table 4-3.

(2) Waste gas
The waste gas mainly comes from the flue produced in kitchen and the gas produced from
burning fuel in the city. Flue will diffusion from top of the buildings through exhaust canal in
buildings after purified by flue-exhauster.
(3) Solid waste
Living solid waste will be up to 480 kg/d. They will be put in bags and collected in 12
garbage boxes set beside roads then sent to transfer station.
4.2 Waste water drainage and analysis of its control steps
(I) Estimate to the amount of water supply and drainage
The amount of water supply and drainage is 364.4 t/d and 252.1 t/d respectively. They are
listed in table 2-3.

EA for Shanghai Hongkou District Liyang Road Old House Protection and Rehabilitation Project
(2) Waste water drainage amount and qulity
Concentration and amount of pollutants in drainage are listed in table 4-3.
The drainage amount of waster water is 252.1 t/d and pollutants such as CODCr, BOD5s 
NH3-N, SS, propagation oil is75.6, 37.8, 6.3, 88.2, 7.6kg/d respectively.
(3) Sewage management steps
Living sewage produced by dwelling house public building will tally with the third class
diffusion standard of Shanghai after collection and sent to municipal sewage pipeline in Liyang.
At last it will go to Quyang water quality purify factory and drainage to water body in city after
reaching drainage standard.
(4) Feasibility analysis of sewage canal
Sewage can not let liberty restricted by sewage quality and construction status of
surrounding sewage pipeline. It must ensure that sewage be treated effectively without letting
to the freshwater riverway directly. Currently the living sewage let in pipeline directly and sent
to Quyang water quality purify factory.
Living sewage amount will decrease after rebuilt and water quality will be improved
because some offices in the region would move away and living habitual of tenements would
change. At the same time the sewage let to municipal pipeline through district sewage pipeline
will be treated efficiently in Quyang water quality purify factory. Since the situation provide
objective conditions for pipeline the exploiter should apply to related government department for
draining water to the municipal sewage pipeline directly.
Compared the two treatment methods the sewage pipeline has less influence to
surrounding environment. It helps alleviating fume diffusion from sewage treatment station and
solving the problem of residual sludge treatment. Furthermore, from the point of view of
engineer economy it is more reasonable of treating centralize than separately.
4.3 Waste gas diffusion and analysis of its control steps
Waste gas from kitchen
Natural gas is used in kitchens in this region. The most amount consumed in city is 200m3
/hr, average at about 100 m3 /hr. Diffusion amount is estimated in the basis of 12.8 kg NO,(in
which, 6.3 kg NO2). 1.0 kg SO2, 2.4 kg flue being diffused with burning 104 m3 gas( diffusion
parameter is cited from Environment Practical Data Handbook). Pollutants produced by
burning gas are listed in table 4-4.

4.4 Solid waste and analysis of its control steps
(1) Classification and amount of solid waste
Living garbage will be brought when people live in after the project finished.
Living garbage mainly come from kitchen and other living ways. The produce amount of
living garbage is about l.Okg/d.p based on present living standard of Shanghai and statistical
data recent years. There are 96 tenements in the region and about 480 residents in the premise
of 5 person every tenement. Garbage amount calculate based on this situation is listed in table
4-5. Components of living garbage are listed in table 4-6.

Garbage from residents' house are sent to collection box in the community and then

(2) Analysis of solid waste treatment
According to the set principle of solid waste management ordinance the waste produced
by the project is living garbage and belongs to common solid waste.
[SEPA-Tongji Research Institute of Environmental Protection Science and Technology]  -26 -



EA for Shanghai Hongkou District Liyang Road Old House Protection and Rehabilitation Project
The amount of solid waste produced by residents after the project finished is 182.5 t/a
based on the engineer analysis.
Living solid waste will be put in bags and collected in 12 garbage boxes set beside roads
then sent to transfer station at Baoan road and treated together by environment protect
department.
4.5 Analysis of main surrounding pollution source
4.5.1 Main waste gas pollution source
There is no industry waste gas pollution source around the project. The gas source is tail
gas from Xingjiaqiaobei Road in the north, Liyang Road across mid-part of the region, Baoan
Road in the east and Changchun Road in the west of the region. Among these places, Baoan
and Changchun Road are so narrow and so many stalls and simple buildings distribute
alongside the pavements that people have to walk on the drive-lane. This makes the traffic is
heavy so the tail gas pollution of automobiles is serious. Liyang Road will rebuild to be the
interior street in the community and it will help reducing vehicle flux greatly resulting in
alleviating pollution. But with the degenerating of traffic function of Liyang Road will
certainly increase the vehicle flux in the other three streets. They will be the main pollution
resource in the future.
Sichuanbei Road locates 40m to the west of Changchun Road which is the west boundary
of the region and is almost parallel with it. Siping Road locates 50m to the east of Baoan Road
and Liyang Road which are the east boundary of the region and is almost parallel with them.
Because these two streets being the main traffic artery in north-south direction, the vehicle tail
gas has some influence in the project. But the influence is not so great for the streets are kept
away by buildings from the community.
4.5.2 Noise source
At present, the main noise source comes from traffic in Liyang Road, Xingjiaqiaobei Road
and Changchun Road. It will come from Xingjiaqiaobei Road and Changchun Road and Baoan
Road after the rebuild being finished. The nearest distance from Xingjiaqiaobei Road to the
north part of the project is about 24m. The traffic flux will increase as a result of widening the
street and it will influence residents in the north part greatly. Changchun Road and Baoan Road
is close to boundary of the community and they will take the traffic pressure breakaway from
Liyang Road after rebuild. This part of the region will still be influenced by the noise
regardless of putting up with greenbelt between the buildings and streets.

4.6 Environment analysis of plane arrangement
In view of architecture arrangement this project pays much attention to architecture
arrangement and environmental sight design. Greenbelt, racket court, waterscape and club are
built centralized in the community. Greenbelt ratio reaches 60%. Various dwelling houses
distribute properly in the community. All these establishments provide comfortable and
convenient dwelling environment.
The dwelling houses are kept away from surrounding streets that produce great noise by
greenbelt. This has some effects to the residents dwell along the streets but the effects are not in
evidence because of the restrict of former construct arrangement.
Circular pump in the water area is going to use submersible pump. It is anticipated that
circulate noise would not affect residents nearby.
Since the garbage boxes being arranged in greenbelt besides roads in the community and
the garbage being collected and transferred on schedule, they will have almost no influence to
residents and sight.
Analyses in general the plane arrangements of the project have no serious environment
problems except traffic noise.
Suggestion: Because the project is oriented to be a top grade uptown so the doors and
windows in all rooms should be sound insulation. In order to cut down the influence to
residents at the best, signs of no-homing and speed-limiting at I5km should be set in the
community.

Based on the monitoring results in Table 5-9 and compared to the assessment standards
in Table 1 -8, it is shown that:
Site 1I the noise levels of day and night can attain the assessment standards and not
affected by surrounding traffic noises.
Site 2" the noise levels are higher than the assessment standards because of the traffic
noises in Baoan Road. The maximum excess value is 7.1dB(A) in daytime and 2.7 dB(A) in
nighttime.
Site 30 the noise levels are much higher than the assessment standards because of the
traffic noises. The maximum excess value is 16.5dB(A) in daytime and 15.1dB(A) in
nighttime.
Site 4# the noise levels are much higher than the assessment standards because of the
traffic noises. The maximum excess value is 16.1dB(A) in daytime and 15.4dB(A) in
nighttime.
Site 5# the noise levels are much higher than the assessment standards because of the
traffic noises. The maximum excess value is 12.9dB(A) in daytime and 12.7dB(A) in
nighttime.
Site 6 -the noise levels are much higher than the assessment standards in daytime
(13.7dB(A))but only slightly high in nighttime(O.4dB(A)).
Site7# the noise levels are much higher than the assessment standards in daytime
(11.9dB(A))but slightly higher in nighttime(2.IdB(A)).
Site 80 the noise levels of day and night all are much higher than the assessment
standards, in daytime (18.1dB(A)) and in nighttime(25.2dB(A)).
In general, the existing environmental quality of this Plot is highly affected by
surrounding traffic noises and the Leq can't attain the assessment standards, especially at night.

6.Sound Environment Predict and Impact Assessment
6.1. Predict and Impact Assessment of Noise due to Traffic
6.1.1 Predict of Noise due to Traffic
Establishing prediction model, we can predict and assess noisy range and degree due to
the traffic(North Xingjiaqiao Road, Changchun Road and Baoan Road).
According ((Technical Guidelines on Environmental Impact Assessment Acoustic
Environment)) (HJ/T2.4-1995), the following equation which is fit to predict the traffic noise
along the road can be adopted. Vehicles droved on the roads are classified. Noise of all classes
is calculated respectively at first. Then total equivalent sound level is calculated by
superposition.
L,q (h), = L., + 1 0 lg( S T )+lOlgD  +lOlg[°(l  2I)+ MAS 30

average sound level apart 7.5m from center road caused by vehicles of all classes can be
calculated by regressive equations listed in following table.

North Xingjiaqiao road, Changchun road and Baoan road are city road. According to
investigation, average velocity of small vehicles is 40km/h and average velocity of middle
vehicles is 30km/h0
(3) N,
In terms of general planning of North Sichuan road area, transportation of the area
surrounding this Project will run through uptown as little as possible to protect specific
historical atmosphere of the area. Because of passable road density from south to north and
obvious deficiency of road from east to west in this area, Hailun Raod which lies at the south of
assessing area, Tongxin Road-East Jiangwan Road-Shanyin Road-Ouyang Road which lies at
north of assessing area and North North Xingjiaqiao Road which lies in south of assessing area
will be broadened to alleviate traffic jam from east to west. The vehicles running from south to
north will pass through East Jiangwan Road and Tianai Road outside assessing area. Therefore,
the prediction vehicle flow of North North Xingjiaqiao Road is 150% of the current vehicle
flow and the prediction vehicle flows of Changchun Road and Baoan Road which are given the
same value are 120% of current vehicle flow of Changchun Road.

(4) Situation and greening of the road
North North Xingjiaqiao Road will be broadened to four fast lanes, two slow lanes and pavements.
The total width will be 40 meters. The ground between pavement and ftrst line of buildings will be
covered by greenery.
Baoan and Changchun Road all have two fast lanes and two slow lanes. The total width will
be 15 meters. The ground between pavement and first line of buildings also will be covered by greenery.
6.2.3 Prediction result and assessment
Since there are no sideways along Baoan Road, cars, bikes and pedestrians are all in the
same route and the traffic is lower. After this Project is completed, the situation in Baoan Road
will be almost the same as in Changchun Road, which are extended from south to north. So the
traffic flow in Baoan Road is refer to that in Changchun Road in this noise assessment, the
calculated results on noise levels are listed Table 6-3-6-5.

The above prediction results show that the traffic noises from the three roads will affect
greatly on the first row buildings of this Project facing the roads. Now that the existing noise
levels are already overrun, the effects on the buildings will be even greater, especially at night,
after the reconstruction is completed owing to the broad roads. So the protective measures
should be applied for the first row buildings by the unit of construction and designer.
The ideal environmental noise levels for normal sleep is 3OdB(A) and the maximum value
is 5OdB(A). In our country, the noise level under 4OdB(A) is required for bedrooms according
to the "Design Criterion of Noise on Residence Building (GBJ118-88) ".
The standard of noise level under 5OdB(A) will be adopted for all the flats in this Project.
Noise isolation measures, such as using double-windows, must be applied.
According to the "Residence Building Design Criterion( DGJ08-20-2001) in Shanghai ",
noise isolation of 3OdB(A) can be reached by using double-windows. After such measures are
adopted, all the flats of this Project can meet the required standard of noise at night.

7. Other environmental impact analysis
7.1 Atmospheric impact analysis
With this project implemented, the main roads around the programming reconstructed
community are the Liyang Road and Baoan Road to the east, the Changchun Road to the west
and Xingjiaqiao north Road to the south.
With this project carried out, the main atmospheric impacts are caused by emission
released from vehicles of the Liyang Road and Baoan Road to the east, the Changchun Road to
the west and Xing Jiaqiao north road to the south, except underground garage. The main air
pollutants are CO and NO2. Here atmospheric impact assessment is going to focus on the effect
of emission from automotives of the Xingjiaqiao north road to the south of the community,
since the vehicle is not heavy.
7.1.1 Emission impact forecasting
7.1.1.1 Forecasting content
(1) The forecasting and calculating of source intensity
According to the vehicle flux predicted, linear source intensity of the Xingjiaqiao North
road calculated is listed in Table7-1.

(2) Forecasting and calculating
The first row of two-store building of 7-meter height inside this community, is opposite to
the Xingjiaqiao North road with 10-meter distance away. The possible maximum concentration
averaged in an hour of this building is going to be calculated under conditions of different
levels of atmospheric stability(B,C,D and E) and various kinds of wind speed. Besides,
forecasting concentration of pollutants discharged by road vehicles in different stores will be
calculated respectively.

7.1.2 Atmosphere impact assessment
The selected assessment standard of average CO concentration per hour is I Omg/m3.
It is manifested in Table 7-2 that the contribution of automotive emissions to the CO
concentrations averaged in an hour in different stores of the south first row building is mostly
under 1.0mg/m3. Only under D and E atmospheric stability with lower wind speed, could the
value be above 1.0mg/mr3. The maximum value is 1.8777 mg/m3, which is also far lower than
the concentration of the assessment standard.
The selected assessment standard of NO2 concentration averaged in an hour is 0.24mg/mr3.
It can be seen in Table 7-2 that the contribution of automotive emissions to the NO,
concentrations averaged in an hour is mostly under 0.1 mg/m3. Only under D and E atmospheric
stability with lower wind speed, could the value of different stores be over 1.0mg/m3, with the
[SEPA-Tongji Research Institute of Environmental Protection Science and Technology]  -43 -



EA for Shanghai Hongkou District Liyang Road Old House Protection and Rehabilitation Project
maximum 0.2160mg/mr3.
Due to the obstruction of the first building, the impact of automotive emissions to the back
buildings is much smaller.
So, the impact of automotive emissions is acceptable, and the environmental air quality
will be still under the standard. Moreover, the route of the No. 47, 592 and 863 buses, which
pass the single-way Liyang road every day, are going to be changed for the reconstruction
project. As the result, only small vehicles will be allowed on Liyang road in the future, which
will obviously improve the environmental air quality in this community.
7.2 Water environmental impact assessment
7.2.1 The total discharged water pollutants analysis
According to the investigation of the sewerage flux and quality of communities in
Shanghai, the gross of sewerage and that of major pollutants at present from this community
are calculated and listed in Table7-3. Moreover, the total value of sewerage and that of main
pollutants from this community in the future are estimated and showed in table 7-4.

Total value ( Va)  27.61     13.80     2.30    32.21        2.76
The discharge amount of CODcr is 27.61t/a, which of BOD5 is 13.80t/a, NH3-N 2.30t/a, SS
32.11t/a and animal and vegetable oils 2.76t/a.
Thus, the main contaminants' gross amount's variety in this subzone's domestic sewage
before and after the project can be calculated, whish is shown as table 7-5.

Variety       -91.87     -44.94    -7.66      -107.19         -9.19
Through the table, it can be seen that the project is going to reduce domestic sewage by
306.25kt/a, and all the main contaminant are going to be reduced greatly. The decrement of
each contaminant is CODcr 91.87t/a, BODs is 44.94t/a, NH3-N 7.66t/a, SS 107.19t/a and
animal and vegetable oils 9.19t/a respectively.
7.2.1 Analysis of the project's drainage effects
According to the analysis of sewage and contaminant's total discharge amount, after the
project is completed and the residents live there, all the daily discharge amount of sewage and
main contaminants will decrease somewhat. In term of some environment protection regulation
of Shanghai, domestic sewage of this subzone lead to the metro sewer line directly, and come
into Quyang sewage clarification plant finally. As a result, the construction of the project is not
going to affect the surface water much.
7.3 Environmental impact analysis of construction period
The houses and supporting facilities to be reconstruct in this project have a huge scale and
the construction period is relatively long, which is about five years--from Mar., 2003 to Sep.,
2007. Accordingly, the relocation of residents is planned from Mar., 2003 to Jan., 2007. Thus
the environmental impact in construction period should pay more attention to.

2. Transport truck
It can be seen from table 7-6 that the main contaminant discharged during construction
periods is dust. In each construction period there is dust exist, including dust emission of
construction storage space and dust emission of road caused by vehicle running, and last long
time. Secondly, the main pollution source is the exhaust gas of construction machinery and tail
gas pollution let by heavy transport trucks.
(1) Lamp black and exhaust gas of construction machinery and transport trucks
This gas include the exhaust gas exhaled by construction machinery and transport trucks
buming oils, which contain NOx, CO and HC. On the one hand, the gas can not be controlled,
on the other hand the time that the gas source being used is limited. So it can be done to reduce
contaminates' discharge amount through managements to control trucks and machines' running
time.
(2) Construction dust emissions
Construction dust emissions include two parts: One is the dust emission of building
materials' storage caused by wind, the other is the dust emission of roads caused by
construction vehicles.

construction periods
Make fully preparation before construction, arrange each zone's construction plan as good
as possible, reduce the area of the site that constructing in the same period, set up some shield
with some height around the building site, strengthen the plan and management of the
construction site, prevent building materials from dust escape during load and unload, storage
and mixing.
There should be definite position and direction in both construction material deposit
(mainly sand and stone) and concrete-mixing field, and dustproof measures. Gush out faucets
should be set up in loose material deposit set up and water should be sprayed for dustproof .
Dustproof bag should be set at the under-part exit of Bulk cement in case the cement lets
go.
The main arterial highway of transport vehicle pass way should be sprinkled water and
cleaned regularly in order to keep road entrance and exit surface clean and moist, which can
reduce the dust pollution of the ground.
Cooperate with traffic department to organize the traffic well finish during the
construction time, to prevent traffic jam incurred because of construction, and to reduce the
emission of waste gas because of the idle speed of vehicle.
Strengthen the maintenance of machinery and vehicle. Forbid the overloading of
construction machine whose fuel is diesel oil. Reduce the discharge of the pollutant.
7.3.2 Affect analysis and managing measurements of sound environment
during construction time
7.3.2.1 characters of yawp pollution during construction time
The noise pollution in the course of building can be divided into the following four kinds
according to different construction stages:
(1) Stage of remove and cubic of earth and stone: Excavator, bull-dozer, air compressor,
loader etc., and the noise generate from transporting vehicles; According to the survey,
heavy-duty transport vehicle of earth and stone can generate equivalent sound magnitude
greater than 90 dB(A) when they pass in and out building site. During the course of building,
we carry out the regulation ((The Noise Limit around Construction Site)) (GB 12523-90).
(2) Stage of piling: Noise of Pile driver, this kind of noise can up to 90 dB(A) from the
place 30m far away, The adopted the pressure piling method can lighten the influence of piling
noise greatly at present. Because the project amount is limited, the noise pollution has not been
outstanding yet this stage.
[SEPA-Tongji Research Institute of Environmental Protection Science and Technology]  -47 -



EA for Shanghai Hongkou District Liyang Road Old House Protection and Rehabilitation Project
(3) Structure stage: Noises such as concrete mixer, vibrator, electric saw etc. If adopting
the commodity concrete, the noise from transporting vehicles will be very serious, too.
According to national standard GB12523-90's request, boundary noise equivalent sound grade
can't be greater than 70 dB(A) in the daytime and can't be greater than 55dB(A) at night.
(4) Noise from the crane and lift at fitment stage, the impact of this kind of noise on
surrounding environment is relatively small; According to national standard GB12523-90's
request, the boundary noise equivalent sound grade can't be greater than 65 dB (A) in the
daytime and can't be greater than 55 dB(A) at night. The working noise of the construction
machines, for instance air compressor machine, excavator, concrete mixer, bull-dozer and etc.
will produce the noises of 70-90 dB (A). And its interfere radius is large, coverage is far.
According to the characteristics such as long building course cycle, transporting goods at
night, it is easy to cause influence to adjacent resident's life. So strict control and managing
measures should be taken.
7.3.2.2 The countermeasures and suggestions to environmental protection during the
construction time
Carry out the regulation of management that forbid the work which can generate great
noise, for example piling, and etc. strictly in Shanghai Environmental Pollution Regulations,
Arrange high noise constructing activities rationally, construct at night should apply separately.
(1) Carry out the request in ((The Noise Limit around Construction Site)) (GB12523-90).
If there is need to work at night, it must apply to the environmental protection department. And
the construction can go on in appointed date after getting permission.
(2) Set up protective screen around the building site. Add some portable and easy sound
insulation protective screen near the high noise equipment. Reduce the impact from equipment
noise on environment.
(3) Strengthen the traffic administration near the building district, avoid the traffic jam and
reduce blow.
(4) When assigning high noise equipments in building site, they should be set relatively
far from the resident. Imports and exports of transport vehicles also should be placed relatively
far from the resident.
7.3.3 Affect analysis and managing measurements of sewage environment
during construction time
The major sewage of the construction period in this project is mud water that constructing
and equipment produced. At the same time the wastewater generates in rain days consisted of a
[SEPA-Tongji Research Institute of Environmental Protection Science and Technology]  -48 -



EA for Shanghai Hongkou District Liyang Road Old House Protection and Rehabilitation Project
large amount of silt particle, suspend solid and mineral oil. All these formed the unsafe factors
to the pavements and streets around, which need great attention during construction time.
(I) Stage of constructing, when removing the groundwater in construction and the mud
water generate during smashing concrete, Propose digging a simple pond at the construction
site to eliminate mud water after sediment or to separate mud and water through centrifugal
machine then discharge. Directed discharging into the sewage system is forbidden or it will
cause the jam in cloacae.
(2) Ooze out water, wash water, rainwater and etc. within construction site should be
discharged into the drainage designed in advance. When taking out the groundwater or the
water accumulated in the hole, under the precondition that will not affect the traffic, it's better
to discharge the wastewater into the well with hose.
(3) A 50cm high simple defending wall should be set up around the material pile site using
stones or cement in order to prevent bulk material from being eroded by rainwater and washed
out into water bodies.
7.3.4 The disposal and managing measures of dregs during construction time
The solid waste is mainly building rubbish in construction time. When the old building is
removed or constructed, project dregs and building rubbish such as wood, brick and tile etc.
will generate. This project has some removal houses and some abandon soil in the course of
foundation excavation, which can be digested in or nearby the district, those surplus should be
collect and cleared up as soon as possible and apply to relevant departments for the landfill in
fixed position. Strengthen the constructing course management, which can control the building
rubbish's amount and their impact on environment.
It will produce wood, tiles and muck when dismantling the old building and constructing.
So the solid waste in the construction period is mainly construction waste. Some dismantled
building and terra produced in the foundation excavating in the project can be disposed in the
community and vicinage. The residue must be gathered as soon as possible and apply to the
managing department for fixedpoint landfill. Intensifying management in the construction
period could control production of construction waste and its influence to the environment.
The people's government of Shanghai has explicit regulation to the disposal of
construction waste and engineering muck. The units undertaking projects must abide by it.
7.3.5 The quarantine and epidemic prevention of the builders
The builders came from many areas and lived in groups. They probably carried diseases
and can easily catch local illness. So the epidemic prevention must be done to improve the
[SEPA-Tongji Research Institute of Environmental Protection Science and Technology]  -49 -



EA for Shanghai Hongkou District Liyang Road Old House Protection and Rehabilitation Project
ability against disease and avoid epidemic. The builds' dejection and domestic waste must be
properly disposed. Relieving nature everywhere and leaving waste about are forbidden. To
avoid epidemic occur and illness propagation spread, there should be temporary lavatories and
waste collection points in the construction situ. The management of habitation and dietetic
hygiene and epidemic prevention must be paid great attention to. The disabled tabby and
concrete should be deposited or landfilled in the proper bottom land after the construction. The
contaminative killesses, dejection and waste must be cleaned out, sanitized and filled with
cleanly earth.

8. Analysis of the Impact on the Social Environment and Comprehensive
Assessment of Ecological Suitability of the Environment in the Residential
Area
8.1 Public Participation
Public participation is a part of EIA work and is a kind of communication between the
owner and the public. Its purpose is to allow communities and persons, especially those
individuals who will be directly affected by the project to learn the property, goal, location and
scope of the project, and any possible big environmental problems arising from the project.
Conducting public participation will improve the effectiveness of EIA work and promote the
sense of environmental protection for ordinary people.
8.1.1 Time and Approaches of Public Participation
There are various ways of public participation including information dissemination,
information feedback, feedback collection and information exchange. According to the
requirement of the EIA, a public participation survey was conducted for the Protective
Rebuilding Project of Old Architectures in Liyang Road, Hongkou District (referred to as the
Project hereinafter) in December 2002.  Under the assistance of local Street Inhabitant
Committees (SICs), opinions were collected using methods of information feedback such as
questionnaire, field investigation and special survey. The survey form is shown in Table 8-1.

Brief introduction to the Project
In order to improve the housing conditions in the North Sichuan Road and Liyang Road and
implement the master planning of old architecture protection, it is decided to conduct the
Protective Rebuilding Project of Contemporary Buildings near Liyang Road, Hongkou
District. The Project will probably cause pollution problems such as flying dust and
noise. Meanwhile buildings of enterprises and inhabitants will be resettled.

8.1.2 Scope and Targets of the public participation
The survey should reflect the opinions and suggestions of the inhabitants in the entire
project area and the persons to be investigated should be representative. The inhabitants,
household representatives and enterprise representative in the Blocks A, B and C within the
project area were selected. The persons to be investigated represent different ages, occupations,
education levels and housing conditions. Besides, they should evenly distribute in the blocks
and opinions from minority groups should be especially considered. The persons to be
surveyed were selected among the registered ones in SICs. 280 questionnaire forms were
issued and 223 were taken back. The retrieve rate is 80.71%.
The investigated persons range from 20 to 88 in age, from primary school to university in
education level, with various occupations such as workers, staffs, teachers, students, engineers
and technicians, the unemployed and retired. Among the 226 investigated persons, 163 live in
Block A, 9 in Block B and 54 in Block C. The statistics is given in Table 8-2.

(13) If own house is dismantled, 51.33% hope to get compensation with the similar houses,
23.01% hope to get cash in once and 5.31% hope to get cash in long term.
It can be found that all the investigated persons quite support the Project and most
representatives of the household and enterprises will also support it from the viewpoint of
holistic interest. Some people were cautious and avoided answering in a straightforward way
because their interest is related to the Project directly. Some people raised good suggestions in
the respect of environmental protection and requests to the environmental department which
are summarized as follows.
(I) Many people think that the current housing condition is poor and the living space is
too small. They hope that the Project could be conducted as soon as possible to improve the
housing condition and the environment. They have shown their initiative to support the Project.
(2) Inhabitants hope that the environmental department should manage the Project strictly
according to relevant laws and regulations so that it can be smoothly conducted meanwhile
their interest can be guaranteed. Especially during the construction period care should be taken
of the inconvenience and disturbance resulted from the construction, controlling the disposal of
solid waste, noise, piling, and noise in the evening caused by construction
(3) Most household representatives hope that the new Blocks should have better green
environment and be an ecological residential area. They also hope to improve the
comprehensive conditions such as security and traffic.
(4) The Project is related to individuals' interest. Some inhabitants asked that the
[SEPA-Tongji Research Institute of Environmental Protection Science and Technology]  -55 -



EA for Shanghai Hongkou District Liyang Road Old House Protection and Rehabilitation Project
government should make reasonable policy for resettlement and method for compensation of
resettlement. The replacement should not result in degraded living conditions and housing
conditions. Some of them asked to be relocated nearby or at original places. Some old, sick and
disabled persons hope to have such facilities as hospital, shopping, security and school. Most
inhabitants hope to get compensation with similar houses, some of them hope to get cash in
once, and only a small part hope to get cash in long term.
In conclusion, Most people support the Project. They hope that after the construction of
the Project the measures of environmental protection should be substantial and the
environmental monitoring should be strengthened.
8.2 Analysis of Social Environmental Impact
As one of the most important parts in Shanghai Old Downtown Area and act as one of the
most important functional core areas in Hongkou District, the northem part of Lao Hongkou,
covering about 83.6ha., is now facing more and more intensified pressures of redevelopment.
The areas along Liyang Road, Duolun Road, Shanyin Road and Luxun Park hold great values
on old town scene, historical architecture and culture, which is an important historical and
cultural Special Zone in Shanghai as well as in Hongkou District. The orientation of
development in this area will feature a complex of culture, tourism and relaxation etc. The
balance between old downtown reconstruction and historical scene protection will be
considered while up-grading the functional level of this Old Downtown to meet the needs of
social development.
This Project belongs to a project featuring old downtown reconstruction, protective
contemporary architecture renovation and environmental construction. During construction,
some municipal roads, green lands and underground pipelines will be effected. Those buildings
that are not up to the plan and no value of protection will be pulled down. Some factories,
shops and families will be removed. They will be compensated accordingly. After
reconstruction and inner decoration, the functional standards of each new flat and the level of
the community will be up-graded greatly. The improving of living conditions and construction
of more green lands will be propitious to its surrounding environment and people's living
standards. The reconstructed community, featuring inhabitance, culture and tourism, will play
an important role to the development of Hongkou District as well as upgrade the street of
Sichuan Road N. to a high-level shopping and sightseeing complex.

8.3 Comprehensive Assessment of Ecological Suitability of the
Environment in the Residential Area
8.3.1 Establishing of the Assessment Indicator System
The indicator system is a 3-layer hierarchical one. There are 2 indicators for the first layer,
ie, the natural ecological environmental indicator and the cultural ecological indicator. There
are 7 indicators at the second layer, ie, the environment quality, and the green and landscape
(belonging to the natural ecological indicator), architecture and facility, culture and education,
traffic convenience, population density, and comprehensive management (belonging to the
cultural ecological indicator). There 14 items in the third layer. The system is introduced in
detail in Table 84.

9. The argumentation of the countermeasure to control pollution in the
operating period
9.1 The commentary of the countermeasure for pollution control
In the project, the water, electricity and coal gas were switched in through municipal
pipeline. The mainly sewage is domestic discharges. The sewage was brought into municipal
waste pipe through the pipe in the block and was treated in the Quyang effluent plant finally.
There are not underground parking lots, transformer substation and fan facilities house in the
community. So the countermeasure to control pollution is seldom took into account. In the
design at present, the disposal of the domestic waste is mainly considered. It is planned to setup
some waste collection point. The different domestic waste will be classified and collected by
bags and piled in different garbage bins respectively. The waste in garbage bins was transported
to the collection point by the realty management staff everyday and was disposed by the
environmental sanitation department. The waste in the community will be cleaned up everyday.
9.2 The measures for farther pollution control
The mainly environmental problem of the project is the traffic noise pollution from the
circumjacent roads such as Liyang road, Changchun road, Siping road and Xingjiaqiao north
road. The measures as follows is planned to adopted to settle these questions.
(I) Only the dillies can pass through the Liyang road which past across the middle of the
community and the heavy traffics' passing is forbidden. To install conspicuous hooting
forbidden sign at the road section which pass the community can alleviate the influence of
noise to the residents in the community.
(2) When designed, sufficient frontage of the first row of the building would be left
beforehand to landscaping or build earth slope. It can beautify the community and ameliorate
the environment by reducing noise.
(3) The windows and doors of the houses facing the street should adopt the sound
insulation measure. The chamber facing the street can't be designed as bedroom. It will be only
used as accessorial chamber.
(4) Hooting is forbidden when the vehicles pass in and out the community. The speed of
the vehicles passing through the community is govemed.

9.3 The environment profit and loss analysis
Fixing the sound insulation windows and doors on the first row of the building near the
Xingjiaqiao north road, Changchun road. Bao'an road and Liyang road will increase the
investment for about Y300,000. Furthermore, the landscaping and construction of waterscape
need more investment too.

10. Conclusions and Suggestions
10.1 Main Conclusions
I.According to the whole layout of Hongkou District, this Project-- Reconstruction of the
Contemporary Buildings under Protection near Liyang Road, will pay equal attention on
development and historical style and features protection to renovate the old buildings built in
1920-30s into inimitable ones. After reconstruction through restoration and inner decoration,
their dwelling functions and using values will be highly raised.
The Project is located at Siping Road, Liyang Road and Baoan Road in the east;
Changchun Road in the west; North Xingjiaqiao Road in the south; 138 Lane of Baoan Road
in the north with an area of about 9.36ha. Three Blocks, i.e. A, B, C blocks, are divided in this
Project. The total investment is I billion yuan.
2
The Project covers total construction area of about 94430m , among which Block A of
56190.3m2, Block B of 16806.5 m 2and Block C of 14859.5 m 2. The assorted public facilities
area is about  nm and the capacity rati. is 0.36 with total investment of I billion yuan.
This project locates in north part of the former Hongkou. The region is one of integrate
service center in Shanghai and is the main part of public service and activity center in Hongkou.
It is a multifunctional district with culture life fallow, sightseeing and traveling, commerce and
food service. At the same time it is the characteristic region organic combining the history with
present and integrated service with middle and top grade inhabitation.
The reconstruction and the Protection is on the premise of preserving the primary
construction style and the view of the community. The disordered buildings will be removed in
order to improve environmental quality and increase the green ratio. In a word, the project is
compatible with both surrounding environment and programming.
2. The latest monitoring data of air quality were collected from the Environmental Protection
Monitoring Station near the project. It is shown that the hourly concentration ranges, daily
average concentrations and percentages beyond standard of SO2 and NO2 are all under the
assessment criterion while those of PM1o changed a lot and the percentage beyond standard is
40%. In general, the ambient air quality in assessment area is fine.
Because east ,south, west, and middle of the plot affected by traffic noise of Liyang and Baoan
Road, North North Xingjiaqiao Road, Changchun Road, and Liyang Road respectively, the
existing environmental quality of this Plot is worse than the assessment standards, especially at
night except site 1 which is not affected by surrounding traffic noises..

3. The water source will be not changed after reconstruction and the tap water will be taken in
from the municipal tap pipeline under the Liyang Road at middle of the Plot. Now the water
consumption amount isl364m3/d and discharge amount is 1091.2m3/d.
After reconstruction, the maximum water consumption amount will be 364.4m3/d.The drainage
amount of waste water of this project is 252.1 t/d and pollutants such as CODcr BOD5,
NH3-N, SS, propagation oil is75.6. 37.& 6.3. 88.2 7.6kg/d respectively. Living sewage produced
by dwelling house public building will tally with the third class diffusion standard of Shanghai
after collection and sent to municipal sewage pipeline in Liyang. According regulations
referred to environmental protection on Shanghai, sewage will go to Quyang water quality
purify factory at last.
4. The noisy sources around the project are mainly from nearby traffic noise. According to the
existing monitoring and prediction results, Relatively great effects are from Liyang Road and
Baoan Road at the east, North Xingjiaqiao Road at the south, Changchun Road at the west and
Liyang Road at the middle of the community. After reconstruction, only mini cars can pass
through the Liyang Road which past across the middle of the community and the heavy traffics'
passing is forbidden, which is benefit to the sound environment inside the community. The
buildings next to North Xingjiaqiao Rd is rather affected by traffic noise and so necessary noise
protection measures must be applied.
5. The impact of automotive emissions is acceptable, and the environmental air quality will be
still under the standard. Moreover, the route of the No. 47, 592 and 863 buses, which pass the
single-way Liyang road every day, are going to be changed for the reconstruction project. As
the result, only small vehicles will be allowed on Liyang road in the future, which will
obviously improve the environmental air quality in this community.
6. The amount of solid waste produced by residents after the project finished is 182.5 t/a.
Living solid waste will be put in bags and collected in 12 garbage boxes set beside roads then
sent to transfer station at Baoan road and treated together by environment protect department.
7.The waterscape in this Project should meet the standards of GradeVin "Surface Water
Environment Quality Standard". To avoid water quality deterioration, a water pump system will
be adopted to make water recycle flowing while fountains are set to supplement oxygen into
water. Forbidden to throw and no wastewater enter into the water through rain pipes by
strengthening management measures.
8.The comprehensive score of ecological suitability is 84, corresponding to high quality
housing area and near the villa area, indicating that the Project has good ecological suitability.

The development of real estate can promote the development of commerce as well as the
development of local economy. Above all, this Project is acceptable.
10.2 Suggestions
1. The restaurant in the business building should be arranged in direction of downwind of the
main wind direction.
2. After reconstruction, only mini cars can pass through the Liyang Road which past across
the middle of the community and the heavy traffics' passing is forbidden. And conspicuous
"No homing " signs will be set on the nearby road section. This will reduce the impact on
the residents in this Project. When designed, sufficient frontage of the first row of the
building would be left beforehand to landscaping or build earth slope. It can beautify the
community and ameliorate the environment by reducing noise.
3. The windows and doors of the houses facing the street should adopt the sound insulation
measure. The chamber facing the street can't be designed as bedroom. It will be only used
as accessorial chamber.
4. Homing is forbidden when the vehicles pass in and out the community. The speed of the
vehicles passing through the community is governed.
