     "2.8 Notification and Advertising
            The international community should be
     notified in a timely manner of the opportunity to
     bid. This will be done by advertising invitations
     to apply for inclusion in a bidder's invitation
     list, to apply for prequalification, or to bid;
     such advertisements should be placed in at least
     one newspaper of general circulation in the
     Borrower's country and, in addition, in at least
     one of the following forms:
            (i)     a notice in the United Nations

            (ii)    an advertisement in a newspaper,
                    periodical or technical journal of
                    wide international circulation; or
            (iii)   a notice to local representatives of
                    countries and territories referred
                    to in the Guidelines, that are
                    potential suppliers of the goods
                    required."
     (b)  The following is added at the end of paragraph
2.21 of the Guidelines:
     "As a further alternative, bidding documents may
     require the bidder to state the bid price in a
     single currency widely used in international trade
     and specified in the bidding documents."
     (c)  Paragraphs 2.55 and 2.56 of the Guidelines are
deleted

Account in respect thereof, such documentation and
information as the Bank may reasonably request to support
withdrawal applications in respect of such contract.
5.   The provisions of the preceding paragraph 4 shall
not apply to contracts on account of which the Bank has
