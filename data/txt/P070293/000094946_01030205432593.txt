EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
I. Preamble
1. Four key Public Enterprises (PEs) are being privatized under the Nigeria Privatization
Support Project (NPSP) by the Federal Government of Nige'ria (FGN) and financed by the
International Development Agency (IDA) of The World Bank. The enterprises are: National
Electric Power Authority (NEPA), Nigerian Telecommunications Limited (NITEL), Nigerian
Mobile Teleconmunications Limited (M-TEL), and Nigeria Airways Limited (NAL). Additional
eighty-six (86) State-Owned Enterprises (SOE) that have been scheduled in the Public
Enterprises (Privatization and Commercialization) Act No. 28 of 1999, were screened for
probable environmental audit requirements on the basis of their activities.
2. The Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE), and the Secretariat of the National Council on
Privatization (NCP) under the Office of the Presidency of FGN are responsible for the
privatization and commercialization processes of the PEs. As part of the divestiture processes,
the environmental issues at the enterprises are being addressed during the project preparation by
including environmental audits to analyze existing conditions at and around specific sites and
facilities of the enterprises. Hence, this report is the result of environmental pre-audits carried out
to rank and prioritize the facilities for the PEs with respect to those requiring comprehensive
(Full) aludit, partial audit and no audit.
3. The assignment was carried out in two phases: phase I involved review of all existing
documentation and historical information, as well as, performing visual inspection of selected
sites and facilities; and phase II comprised assessment of risks, prioritization of pollution
concerns, and ranking of sites according to the need for auditing at divestiture. The report has
been prepared for the BPE and the World Bank, Private Sector Development Department with
Paul Ballard as the Task Team Leader. The Environmental Audit Team (EAT) that conducted
the pre-audit assessment comprised Dr. Kobina Atobrah (Team Leader) and Malick A. K. John
(Principal Environmental Engineer).
4. The enterprises for the pre-audit assessment were from the following sectors: power and
energy utilities, telecommunications, and the (airline) transportation industry. The pre-audit was
carried out to develop a prioritized list of concerns related to past and on-going activities in the
privatization candidates; and a review of the capacity of the Bureau of Public Enterprises, as well
as the Ministry of Environment (formerly Federal Environmental Protection Agency, FEPA), to
monitor and enforce existing regulations as well as the capacity to execute remediation plans.
II. Environmental Setting:
5. The major environmental issues of concern in Nigeria include soil degradation, rapid
deforestation, desertification, and droughts in the northern regions that are severely affecting
marginal agricultural activities. Furthermore, constraints in the generation, transmission and
distribution of electricity to the national grid from hydropower dams and gas-fired thermal plants
are causing disruptions to the national economy. The national environmental issues and concerns



can be exacerbated through the privatization of public enterprises and the accelerated
industrialization of Nigeria. Some of the immediate problems could be: the health impacts of
*pollution derived from inadequate water supply and shortage of electricity supply; air and noise
pollution; poor sanitation, drainage and solid waste services and management; poor industrial
hygiene; and poor industrial waste management.
6. In general, there is relatively low coverage and access to basic services such as water supply
and sanitation, drainage, solid waste collection and disposal. For instance, controlled landfills,
incineration and resource recovery facilities are few. Hence-the health and safety issues,
including medical monitoring and providing appropriate industrial hygiene for workers, would
be essential in minimizing the negative effects deriving from the environmental concerns
affecting the country, including the prevention of HIV/AIDS exposure to the larger population.
111. Selection of Facilities for Environmental Audits:
7. Rankings of the Facilities belonging to the enterprises were undertaken based on the degree of
risk to the environment emanating from the sites. The risk characterization was a process of
estimating the probable incidence of adverse impacts to potential receptors under various
exposure conditions, including an elaboration of uncertainties associated with such estimates.
The ranking process applied in the pre-audit assessment involved the qualitative estimation of
the potential risks and/or hazards due to activities at the Facilities.
8. The Facilities of the PEs were assigned scores on the basis of Audit Index Factors (AIF)
which have been determined for the sites. The AIF was the degree of pollution potential for a
Facility of an enterprise by which assessment for full audits could be determined. The Audit
factors were incorporated into a relative ranking scheme that used a combination of weights and
ratings to produce a numerical value called Audit Index. To obtain the number from each Audit
factor that determined the index for the pollution potential, the weight was multiplied by the
rating. The total of the numbers for individual Audit factors gave the Audit Index. Evaluation of
the Audit Index with respect to the Facilities of the PEs provided the relative significance of
each site with respect to pollution potential. The cumulative scores for each Facility were
determined, and the site with the highest score assigned the most likely site to require a full audit
to be undertaken. The ranking procedure is similar to the scoring process of the DRASTIC Index
(Aller and Others, 1987; Atobrah and Others, 1989; Atobrah, 1990; Asante-Duah, 1993; and
Asante-Duah and Others, 1996). The Audit Index gives a measure of whether a site is located in
a generally sensitive or vulnerable area and has a significant pollution potential to the
environment.
IV. Rating Components:
9. The criteria considered to have little impact on the environment were ranked by assigning the
lowest rating of one (1), and the criteria with significant impact on the environment were
assigned the highest rating of ten (10). The rating components for evaluating and characterizing
the audit potential of a site were as follows:



*  Type of Enterprise (i.e. activities at facilities);
*  Air Emissions (i.e. impact on air quality);
*  Wastewater (i.e. impact on surface water and groundwater receptors);
*  Solid Waste (i.e. impact on the environment);
*  Noise;
*  Occupational Health and Safety Issues;
*  Environmental Management and Regulatory Framework; and
* Level of Capacity Building, Training and Awvareness.
V. Weighting Components:
10. EachAudit factor was assigned a relative weight ranging from one (1) to five (5); the least
significant with a weight of 1 and the very significant with a weight of 5. For example, a factor
such as 'Air Emission' is assigned a weight of 5 if the impact is very significant and a weight of
I if the impact is of least significance. The weighting was assessed on the overall affects on
pollution potential for the sites by considering weighting components such as:
*  Depth to water;
*  Soil and aquifer media;
.  Topography;
*  Impact on land-use and planning;
*  Impact to wetlands and water bodies; and
*  Impact on workers.
VI. Results
11. The Facilities of the PEs were ranked into categories of those that required full audits, those
requiring partial audits and those requiring no audits, based on the cumulative Audit Index
Factors (AIF) for the site.
The rankings were categorized as follows:
- Facilities with Audit Index Factors of cumulative scores above 140 were
considered high risk and would require full audits;
-  Facilities with Audit Index Factors of cumulative scores ranging from 100 -
140 were considered medium risk and would require partial audits;
-  Facilities with Audit Index Factors of cumulative scores less than 100 were
considered low risk and would require no audits.
12. Based on the field assessments and on the scores for the Audit Index Factors, the Facilities
of the PEs have been ranked as follows:



A. Facilities Requiring Full (or Comprehensive) Audits:
> NEPA FACILITIES: All the Hydro Electric Power Stations, consisting of Kainji
(192), Shiroro (154) and Jebba (144), as well as the Thermal (Gas-Fired) Power
Stations of Afam Power Station (145), Delta Power Station, Ughelli (147), Lagos
Power Station, Egbin (142), and Sapele Power Station (162).
> NITEL FACILITIES: The Facilities at Abuja (Wuse) (141), Benin City (149),
Lagos Facilities (158), New Bussa (149).
>  THE NATIONAL CONTROL CENTER (NCC), OSHOGBO.
B. Facilities Requiring Partial Audits:
> NEPA FACILITIES: Bulk Supply Substations at Kaduna (138) and Kano (136).
> NITEL FACILITIES: The Facilities located in and around Ajaokuta (114), Lokoja
(114), Kaduna (124), Kano (131), and Sapele (122).
> NIGERIA AIRWAYSLIMITED (NAL) FACILITIES: Lagos Facilities (129), and
Kano (133).
C. Facilities Requiring No Audits:
> M-TEL FACILITIES: Facilities located at Abuja (98), Lagos (99), Kaduna (95),
and Kano (92).
> NIGERIA AIRWAYS LIMITED (NAL) FACILITIES: The facilities located at
Abuja (90), Kaduna (80), and Benin City (80).
VII. Summary ofPre-Audit Findings:
13. In general, the significant environmental pre-audit findings for both the NEPA and NITEL
facilities requiring comprehensive (full) audits commonly included the following: waste (used)
oil getting into the downstream waters, no spill contingency plan for prevention and control, poor
management of waste oil; solid wastes consisting of metal scraps from abandoned engines and
vehicles, pile of discarded metal pieces and old rusted roofs for maintenance areas; poor
management of estate for staff; no environmental management plan/system available for station,
including lack of knowledge on regulatory framework, no liaison with Ministry of Environment,
and no capacity building for environmental services and requirements.
14. The Kainji Hydro Power Station required a proper management and rehabilitation of the
housing estates for the staff, and Jebba Power Station would need urgently a replacement of the
Braithwaite water tank for upgrading the water supply system to the station.
15. The pre-audit findings for the Nigerian Airways Limited (NAL) facilities at Kano and Lagos
iv



indicated: lack of knowledge on regulatory framework, no liaison with Ministry of Environment,
and no capacity building for environmental services and requirements; handling of waste (used)
oil was poor and inadequate, and no contingency plans for oil spill prevention and control; no
enforcement of health and safety measures at work place.
16. Based on the activities at the National Control Center (NCC) at Oshogbo, comprehensive
audit would be required to be undertaken, including the possibility of dismantling some
equipment and an execution of a decommissioning plan.
17. Consultations: Consultation with stakeholders were carried out whenever possible during
the field inspections of various facilities and sites across the country. There was a lack of
knowledge about the privatization and commercialization processes currently being pursued by
BPE at most of the facilities in the rural and urban areas. In general it was observed that at the
NEPA and NITEL facilities inspected no new lands were required within the existing
boundaries, and that resettlement of displaced persons have been taken care of long time ago.
18. Divestiture Guidelines: A 'road map' or guidelines, consisting of about fourteen (14)
steps, have been proposed to assist the Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE) in determining when
to conduct environmental audits and decommissioning plans during the divestiture of
privatization candidates. The steps include when to conduct various plans, such as contingent
liabilities, sampling protocol, performance indicators, and environmental management. Also the
steps show at what stage to develop terms of references (TOR) for environmental audits. Also
guidelines for environmental auditing have been provided as ANNEXE A.
VIII. Decommissioning Plans
19. During the pre-audit assessment it was observed that both NEPA and NITEL, and possibly
Nigeria Airways, would require decommissioning plans to dismantle, remove, and transport to
safe disposal sites obsolete plants and equipment. The need for decommissioning plan must be
evaluated during the full audits of the facilities. When the need is determined, the
decommissioning plan must be conducted separately from the environmental audit, and must
adhere to the World Bank regulations that demand a decommissioning plan (DP) with a full
environmental assessment and properly carried out cost estimates.
IX Statutory Framework:
20. The policy initiatives and underlining principles of FGN have been geared towards the
framework of the country's natural resource management policies for integrating environmental
concerns into the private sector plans, programs and development actions.
In 1989, the FGN formulated a National Policy on Environment that led to the establishment of
the Federal Environmental Protection Agency (FEPA), through Decree No. 58 of 1988 as
amended by Decree 59 of 1992 and further amended by Decree 14 of 1999 with the mandate for
the overall responsibility towards ensuring a good quality environment for Nigeria. Since then
FEPA has been absorbed into the Ministry of the Environment and no longer operates as a
separate or independent agency.
v



21. It is generally recognized by FGN that standards, guidelines and statutes to protect the
environment and support private sector participation must be set at levels at which no known or
anticipated adverse human health effect would occur and which allows an adequate margin of
safety. The guidelines and standards must be developed under the instructions and environmental
assessment procedures described in the World Bank operational policy, bank procedures, good
practices and safeguard policies (i.e. OP/BP/GP4.01). Until these standards are developed
specifically for Nigeria, it would be advisable to adhere to the standards by the World Health
Organization (WHO), European Union Standards, and the United States Environmental
Protection Agency (USEPA).
22. Legal Framework on Liabilities: The Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE) must work
closely with the Ministry of the Environmnent (MOE) to ascertain who assumes the
responsibilities for environmental liabilities at the PEs. For instance, do the liabilities fall on the
new owners or on the former owners? It appears the laws of Nigeria are silent on these issues,
and hence both BPE and MOE should work jointly in order to determine the appropriate law(s)
covering environmental liabilities with respect to: privatization policy, due diligence, and
indemnification, so that there would be a clear understanding of who is liable for contamination,
both past, current and in the future, i.e. during and after divestiture.
23. Monitoring Protocols: There were lack of standards for monitoring environmental
parameters, i.e. measuring physico-chemical and microbial parameters for water quality and air
quality for Nigeria. As a result, the enterprises have been conducting self-monitoring using
standards that were not consistent. An EnvironmentalAdvisor must be hired to and be made
responsible for determining and preparing guidelines and environmnental performance indicators
that are measurable for monitoring sites and facilities of the PEs. The performance indicators can
serve as the instrument for responding to any potential environmental hazard that may occur as a
result of activities by the enterprises. Furthermore, the EnvironmentalAdvisor, on behalf of
BPE, can liaise with the MOE to set up a monitoring and accountability protocol that would
require either monthly, quarterly or yearly reporting from the PEs with respect to addressing
significant mitigation measures and meeting the environmental management challenges of the
facilities.
X Cost Estimates for Conducting Audits:
24. The overall costs for conducting the necessary and appropriate elements of the
Environmental Auditing Programs for Privatization are not to exceed one million, two hundred
and fifty thousand dollars (i.e. US$1,250,000.00).
The cost estimates can be broken into:
* cost for comprehensive audits for NEPA facilities - US$425,000.00;
* cost for comprehensive audits for NITEL facilities - US$200,000.00;
* cost for comprehensive audits for NCC, Oshogbo (also for NEPA) -
US$75,000.00;
vi



*  cost for partial audits for NEPA facilities -US$100,000.00;
* cost for partial audits for NITEL facilities -US$100,000.00;
* cost for partial audits for NIGERIA AIRWAYS facilities -US$100,000.00;
* cost for hiring Environmental Advisor for BPE - US$250,000.00;
XI. Recommendation:
25. Based on the environmental pre-audits conducted for the four key public enterprises in
Nigeria, it is recommended that comprehensive (full) audits be undertaken for the following
facilities:
National Electric Power Authority (NEPA):
* The Hydro Power Stations located at Jebba, Kainji and Shiroro;
* The Thermal (Gas-Fired) Power Stations located at Afam, Delta (Ughelli), Lagos (Egbin),
and Sapele.
Nigerian Telecommunications Limited (NITEL):
* Facilities located at Abuja, Benin City, Lagos and New Bussa.
National Control Center (NCC):
*  Facilities located at Oshogbo
26. Partial audits must be carried out for the following facilities:
National Electric Power Authority (NEPA):
* The Bulk Supply Substations located at Kaduna and Kano, as well as other major bulk
supply substations in the country;
Nigerian Telecommunications Limited (NITEL):
* Facilities located at Ajaokuta, Lokoja, Kaduna, Kano and Sapele/Benin City area.
Nigeria Airways Limited (NAL):
*  Facilities located at Lagos and Kano airports.
27. No audits should be required for the facilities belonging to M-TEL and the facilities for
Nigeria Airways located at Abuja, Kaduna and Benin City. Furthermore, it should be assumed
that the other facilities belonging to NEPA and NITEL, particularly in the rural areas, would not
require any audits at this time, based on a random 'drive through' observations during the site
visits across the country.
28. Decommissioning Plans: It is recommended that undertaking actual decommissioning
plans for each site must be evaluated and the costs be determined during the comprehensive
audits.
29. Legal Framework and Contingent Liabilities: It is recommended that the former owners
vii



bear the liabilities of past actions before they hand over to the private sector, or the cost for
remediationlmitigation measures must be deducted out of the privatization cost.
30. Guidelines and Environmental Performance Indicators: The EnvironmentalAdvisor to
BPE must liaise with The Ministry of the Environment (MOE) and be responsible for
determining and preparing guidelines and environmental performance indicators which are
measurable for monitoring sites and facilities of the enterprises being privatized, or have already
been privatized.
It is recommended that the allocated amount (US$250,000.00) must be provided to hire the
Environmental Advisor for a three year period.
Furthermore, it is recommended that the Environmental Advisor should liaise with the MOE and
set up a monitoring and accountability protocol that would require either monthly, quarterly or
annual reports with respect to addressing significant mitigation measures and meeting the
environmental management demands due to the activities and operations of the enterprises. The
monitoring protocol would require working in partnership with the leading agencies, such as The
Ministry of Agriculture, non-governmental organizations NGOs), community-based
organizations (CBOs), and other relevant government institutions.
31. Guidelines for Environmental Management in Divestiture: As part of the divestiture of
public enterprises, the 'road map' or guidelines proposed should be used in conjunction with the
guidelines for environmental auditing (ANNEXE A) by the Environmental Advisor of BPE to
assist in preparing due diligence, and in supporting the integration of environmental management
within the divestiture processes for the current and future privatization candidates.
32. Training: It is recommended that the Environmental Advisor should assess and recommend
effective training for the senior management of all the privatization candidates as part of capacity
building requirements in the divestiture processes. The training could consist of workshops or
seminars, with the initial training provided by a qualified local environmental management firm
supported by international consultants.
33. Environmental Management Systems/Plans: Each enterprise must have on its premise a
Senior Official responsible for environmental management activities, and liaise with both the
Environmental Advisor of BPE and the MOE on environmental laws and regulations pertaining
to the activities of the enterprise and participate in training and be part of the capacity building
for environmental management.
34. The Environmental Advisor must coordinate and support the development of contingency
plans that link city/urban contingency plans with that of the privatization candidates.
Furthermore, it is recommended that the enterprises develop and incorporate environmental
management systems/plans (EMS/P) into its management structure. The EMS/P must include
elements such as:
*  execution of environmental monitoring programs for the enterprises;
*  knowledge and compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations;
*  conduct occasional drills to alert the staff and workers on how to react and operate
in cases of emergencies;
*  conduct training and awareness programs as part of good management practices
viii



while promoting capacity building within the enterprise;
* develop the capacity to execute coherent sampling and monitoring programs as
part of remediation plans; and
* carry out medical monitoring, while including HIV/AIDS awareness programs.
35. Period of Performance: The comprehensive and partial environmental audits of the
enterprises must be completed prior to the divestiture of each enterprise. However, the
implementation of the audit action plans and decommissioning plans must be negotiated with the
appropriate interested partners as part of the full divestiture bf each enterprise. This means that
the execution of any proposed audit action plans need not be completed prior to negotiations.
The implementation schedules can be determined during the negotiation of the loans in the
privatization process.

1. INTRODUCTION:
1.1 Background:
This report is an environmental pre-audit assessment of four (4) Public Enterprises (PEs) in the
Federal Republic of Nigeria that are being privatized under the Nigerian Privatization Support
Project (NPSP) by the Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN). The pre-audit is part of the
processes for the privatization and commercialization of State-owned enterprises, and is being
conducted by the Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE) and the Secretariat of the National Council
on Privatization (NCP) under the Office of the Presidency of the FGN. The report has been
prepared for the BPE and the World Bank, Private Sector Development Department with Paul
Ballard as the Task Team Leader, TTL.
The Government of Nigeria has decided that it will transform its role from owner, financier and
operator of PEs to that of policy maker and regulator for the provision of public services. The
goal is to create an enabling environment for the provision of infrastructure services that
improves corporate governance and promotes private sector participation in the
telecommunications, power and air transport sector to stimulate social development and
economic growth.
The assignment was carried out in two phases: phase I involved review of all existing
documentation and historical information, as well as, performing visual inspection of as many
facilities as possible across the country; phase II comprised assessment of risks, prioritization of
pollution concerns, and ranking of facilities according to the need for comprehensive (full)
audits, partial audits and no audits at divestiture.
1.2 Listings
As indicated in the Terms of Reference (TOR, see Appendix) the four key enterprises for the
pre-audit assessment were:
* National Electric Power Authority (NEPA)
* Nigerian Telecommunications Limited (NITEL)
* Nigerian Mobile Telecommunications Limited (M-TEL)
* Nigeria Airways Limited (NAL)
The Lagos State Water System was dropped from the original list because of an on-going
discussion on the nature and scope of divestiture of the enterprise.
Additional listing component was to screen eighty-six (86) Public Enterprises that have been
scheduled in the Public Enterprises (Privatization and Commercialization) Act No. 28 of 1999.



Other listing component of the pre-audit was to strengthen the Ministry of the Environment
(formerly Federal Environmental Protection Agency, FEPA) for supporting the PE divestiture.
1.3 The Nature and Scope of Support:
The proposed privatization support for the project included the following components:
* strengthening of the overall institutional and policy framework for PE divestiture,
including streamlining of procedures for divestiture execution, capacity building
in BPE and NCP, and strengthening of coordination between sector reforms and
privatization; and adoption of consistent overall policy for PE retrenchment;
* implementation of electricity sector unbundling, restructuring, legal and
regulatory reform and NEPA divestiture, aimed at major improvements in service
delivery, efficiency and access for private business and the general population,
and expanded, more reliable investment and supply through competitive private
sector entry and operation;
* implementation of telecommunications sector liberalization, and regulatory
reform, and privatization of the two major state-owned carriers, NITEL and M-
Tel, aimed at major expansion in connectivity through private investment and
entry of new private operators, improved service quality and more affordable
tariffs, due to competition and market liberalization;
* implementation of air transport sector restructuring, through privatization of
Nigeria Airways Limited (NAL), in context of adoption of phased program for
sector liberalization, aimed at improved reliability, safety and efficiency of
international air transport services, and expanded opportunities for private entry
and competition;
1.4 Meetings and Activities:
Several meetings were held with the Senior Officials of the Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE)
that included the Director of Operations, Mr. Tijjani M. Abdullahi and the Deputy Director,
Alhaji A. Adesokan. Also the meetings included Mr. Paul Ballard, the Task Team Leader of the
World Bank and his associate, Ms. Shenhua Wang.
The meeting agreed upon the following tasks to be included in the general assignment for the
pre-audit assessment:
* consultation with stakeholders would be carried out whenever possible during the
field inspections of various facilities and sites across the country;
*  screening of all the enterprises on the list for privatization (eighty-six PEs) would
be carried out based on their activities and their potential impact on the
environment. The screening would group the enterprises into those requiring
comprehensive audits, partial audits, and no audits;
* guidelines would be proposed to show a road map that would enable the BPE
determine the environmental requirements of the future privatization candidates.
2



Meetings were also held with the Managing Directors and Senior Officials of the enterprises, as
well as, with the Directors and Senior Officials of the Ministry of the Environment (including the
former FEPA). The field assessments for the environmental pre-audits were conducted during
the months of November and December 2000, with a visit to as many sites as possible in the
northern and southern regions of Nigeria. These sites were selected strategically to cover a
random sample of facilities for each enterprise. The exercises focused on determining which of
the facilities of the enterprises required full audits to be undertaken. In arriving at the selection
criteria, a system involving the rankings of the Facilities using Audit Index Factors was
developed for the the PEs. The methodology worked very well, and was found to be consistent
with similar ranking formats by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US. EPA)
and other recognized authorities (see the reference used for the report).
This report has been prepared by an Environmental Audit Team (EAT) comprised Dr. Kobina
Atobrah (Team Leader), and Malick A. K. John (Principal Environmental Engineer). The team
worked closely with the Deputy Director for Operations, Alhaji A. Adesokan, and a senior staff,
Mr. Abdullahi R. Imam of BPE, particularly in obtaining the necessary and appropriate letters
authorizing the visits to the facilities of the four enterprises.
2. PROJECT OBJECTIVES
The primary objective of the project was to carry out an environmental pre-audit of the four key
public enterprises listed for divestiture and to develop a ranking that determined the need for a
comprehensive (full) audit, partial audit or no audit before divestiture.
In addition, the objectives included determining the environmental conditions of the enterprises
and determine the probable mitigation measures that may be required for the enterprises. The
goal is to use the pre-audit report to providing the necessary information for internal planning
before divestiture and for external reporting, as well as, indicating the 'road map' for
determining the environmental liabilities and audit studies for future privatization candidates.
Furthermore, the objectives included the review of the national environmental legislation and
administrative framework and capacity for enforcement and compliance, in conjunction with the
relevant safeguard policies of the World Bank Group.
3.0 ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
3.1 Initial Conditions
The Federal Republic of Nigeria is bounded by Cameroon to the east, Chad to the northeast,
Niger to the north, Benin to the west, and the Atlantic Ocean to the south. Until 1991, the capital
was the largest city, Lagos, on the southwestern coast; at that time the new city of Abuja, in the
country's interior, became the capital. Nigeria has a federal form of government and is divided
into 36 states and a federal capital territory.
Nigeria covers an area of 923,768 sq. km (356,669 sq. mi). The country measures about 1,200
km (about 750 mi) from east to west and about 1,050 km (about 650 mi) from north to south.
3



The topography ranges from lowlands along the coast and in the lower Niger Valley to high
plateaus in the north and mountains along the eastern border.
The broad, mostly level valleys of the Niger and Benue rivers form Nigeria's largest physical
region. The Niger enters the country from the northwest, the Benue from the northeast and they
join at the city of Lokoja in the south central region and continue south, where they empty into
the Atlantic at the Niger Delta. Together, they form the shape of a 'Y'. The ecology varies from
tropical forest in the south to dry savanna in the far north, yielding a diverse mix of plant and
animal life.                                     v
The population of Nigeria is 101,232,251 (July 1995 est.), half under the age of 15, and the
growth rate is about 3.16% (1995 est.). There are three main ethnic divisions made up as follows:
Hausa and Fulani (north), Yoruba (southwest), and Ibos (southeast). The gross domestic product
(GDP) of Nigeria is $48.2 billion (1998 est.) and the real GDP growth rate is 4.2% (1999 est.)
with agriculture 54%, industry 19%, government 15% and services 12%.
The electric generation capacity of Nigeria is 5.9 giga-watts (1997 est.) and electricity generation
for the country is 13.575 billion kilowatt-hours (1997 est.). The total energy consumption is 1.0
quadrillion (1998 est.) which is only 0.3% of the world total energy consumption, and per capita
energy consumption (1998 est.) is 9.0 million Btu (versus United States value of 350.7 million
Btu). The energy-related carbon emissions (1998 est.) is 27.1 million metric tons of carbon
(0.4% of world carbon emissions).
Nigeria is party to major international environmental agreements including: Conventions on
Biodiversity, Climate Change, Desertification, Endangered Species, Hazardous Wastes, Laaw of
the Sea, Marine Dumping, Marine Life Conservation, Nuclear Test Ban, Ozone Layer Protection
and Whaling.
3.2 National Policy on the Environment:
The Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN) has taken a number of steps to address various
environmental problems in the country. In 1989, the FGN formulated a National Policy on
Environment that led to the establishment of the Federal Environmental Protection Agency
(FEPA), through Decree No. 58 of 1988 as amended by Decree 59 of 1992 and further amended
by Decree 14 of 1999 with the mandate for the overall responsibility towards ensuring a good
quality environment for Nigeria. Since then FEPA has been absorbed into the Ministry of the
Environment and no longer operates as a separate or independent agency.
In addition, the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Decree No. 86 of 1992 was
promulgated. As a result, EIA Sectoral Guidelines for major sectors of the economy and EIA
procedural guidelines have been developed and are operational. After a decade, the National
Policy on Environment has been updated and revised in 1999 with a number of complementary
policies, strategies and management approaches that ensure, among other factors, that the
environmental monitoring and auditing of existing major development projects are routinely
carried out", as well as, ensuring a mandatory environmental audit of all major existing energy
projects..
4



3.3 Environmental Concerns:
The major environmental issues of concern in Nigeria include soil degradation, rapid
deforestation, desertification, and droughts in the northern regions that are severely affecting
marginal agricultural activities.
Since Nigeria is major oil producing country with about esti4nated proven oil reserves of 22.5
billion barrels (1999 est.) there are potential pollution problems associated with the onshore and
shallow offshore exploration and production activities, particularly in the Niger Delta region.
Nigeria's four refineries have a combined nameplate capacity of over 438,750 bbl/day, but
problems including sabotage, fire, poor management and lack of tum-around maintenance
(TAM) have sharply decreased actual output, thereby causing significant lines at petrol filling
stations throughout the country. Also, it has been reported in the national press that petroleum
product smuggling for resale to neighboring countries (Nigerian prices are highly subsidized) has
exacerbated the country's fuel shortage.
Nigeria contains an estimated 124 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) of proven natural gas reserves (IOth
largest in the world). Due to a lack of gas utilization infrastructure, about 75% of the gas
produced is flared and about 12% is injected to enhance oil recovery. The flaring of the natural
gas is causing major environmental pollution problems within the affected areas in the Niger
Delta region. Therefore, the challenge is to achieve zero flaring of the natural gas within the next
ten years. The newly proposed West African gas Pipeline Project may alleviate the current
problems associated with the flares.
The current national environmental issues and concerns of Nigeria are very similar to those of its
neighbors, i.e. Cameroon and Benin. These include: overpopulation and movement of refugees
into its borders, notably from Niger and Chad; draining of wetlands for agricultural use; soil
erosion; overgrazing; and the continuing spread of HIV-AIDS related problems and malaria.
The industrialization of Nigeria is being accelerated through the privatization of public
enterprises. This could give rise to critical and most immediate problems such as:
* the health impacts of pollution derived from inadequate water supply and shortage
of electricity supply;
+ poor sanitation, drainage and solid waste services;
* poor urban and industrial waste management;
* air pollution;
* noise pollution.
In general, there is relatively low coverage and access to basic services such as electricity, water
supply and sanitation, drainage, and solid waste collection. For instance, controlled landfills,
incineration and resource recovery facilities are few. Hence, health and safety issues, including
medical monitoring and providing appropriate industrial hygiene for workers, would be very
necessary in order to minimize the negative effects deriving from the environmental concerns
affecting the country.
5



4. RANKING
In order to determine which of the Facilities of the PEs required a full and comprehensive audit
to be undertaken, rankings have been carried out of the facilities based on risk characterization.
The risk characterization is a process of estimating the probable incidence of adverse impacts to
potential receptors under various exposure conditions, including an elaboration of uncertainties
associated with such estimates. The ranking process appliedsin this assessment involves the
qualitative estimation of the potential risks and/or hazards due to activities at the Facilities of the
PEs.
An adequate characterization of risks and hazards at a potentially contaminated site allows for a
comprehensive (full) environmental audit to be performed during which the site remediation
process can be better focused, and cleanup criteria can be developed based on the 'acceptable'
level of risks to potential receptors. Furthermore, during the comprehensive audits the greatest
risk can be identified and the site mitigation measures selected to address those issues.
The ranking procedure was similar to the scoring using the DRASTIC Index (Aller and Others,
1987; Atobrah, 1990; Atobrah and Others, 1989), and was based on risk characterization of
hazardous wastes (Asante-Duah, 1993; Asante-Duah and Others, 1996). The ranking approach
provided indication on whether the site was located in a generally sensitive or vulnerable area
and has a significant pollution potential to the environment.
4.1 The Environmental Pre-Audit Evaluation Criteria:
The facilities of the enterprises were assigned scores on the basis of the Audit Index Factors
(AIF) developed for the various sites. The AIF is a degree of pollution potential for a facility by
which assessment for comprehensive audits can be determined. The criteria considered to have
little impact on the environment were ranked by assigning the lowest score of one (1), and the
criteria with significant impact on the environment were assigned the highest score of ten (10).
The scores for each facility were then summed and the site with the highest score assigned the
most likely site to have full audit to be undertaken.
4.1.1 Rating Components:
The rating components for evaluating and characterizing the audit potential of a site were as
follows:
*  Type of Enterprise (i.e. activities at facilities and sites)
*  Emissions and Air Quality
*  Wastewater (i.e. impact on surface water and groundwater receptors)
*  Waste Oil and Spill Control Measures
*  Solid Waste
*  Noise
*  Occupational Health and Safety Issues
6



* Environrmental Management and Regulatory Framework
* Capacity Building, Training and Awareness
The audit evaluation factors were assigned rating components ranging from one (1) to ten (10);
with the least significant rated as 1 and the very significant rated as 10. The Audit Factors were
incorporated into a relative ranking scheme that used a combination of weights and ratings to
produce a numerical value called Audit Index.
4.1.2 Weighting Components:
The weighting was assessed on the overall affects on pollution potential for the sites and
facilities by considering the weighting components as follows:
* Depth to water;
* Soil and aquifer media;
* Topography;
* Impact on land-use and planning;
* Impact on wetlands and water bodies; and
* Impact on workers
Each audit factor was assigned a relative weight ranging from one (1) to five (5); the least
significant with a weight of 1 and the very significant with a weight of 5. For example, a rating
component such as 'Air Emission' was assigned a weight of 5 if the impact to the environment
was very significant and a weight of 1 if the impact to the environment was of least significance.
To obtain the number for each Audit Index Factor (AIF) that determined the degree of the
pollution potential, the weight was multiplied by the rating. The total of the product for
individual Audit Factor gave the Audit Index. Evaluation of the Audit Index for the Facilities of
the PEs provided the relative significance of each facility or site with respect to the pollution
potential.
Based on the cumulative Audit Index Factors derived for the different sites, the Facilities of the
PEs have been ranked into categories of those that required comprehensive (full) audits, those
that required partial audits and those that did not need any audits to be undertaken at this
moment.
The rankings were categorized as follows:
- Facilities with Audit Index Factors of cumulative scores above 140 were
considered as high risk that would require comprehensive (full) audits;
- Facilities with Audit Index Factors of cumulative scores ranging from 100 -
140 were
considered as medium risk and would require partial audits;
7



-  Facilities with Audit Index Factors of cumulative scores less than 100 were
considered as low risk and would require no audits.
5. RESULTS OF RANKING
Based on the cumulative scores for the Audit Index Factors, the facilities of the PEs have been
ranked as follows:
5.1 Facilities Requiring Full (or Comprehensive) Audits:
5.1.1 NEPA FACILITIES:
a). Hydro Electric Power Stations:
i.    Jebba Power Station (144);
ii.   Kainji Power Station (192);

6.0 SECTOR ANALYSIS
6.1 Electricity Utility:
As indicated on EXHIBIT below the Hydro Power Stations for NEPA provided the cumulative
scores for the Audit Index Factors (AIF), ranging from 154 to 192. These facilities would require
full environmental audits to be undertaken.
The Thermal Plants, which were all gas-fired, had cumulative scores for AIF ranging from 142
to 162. With exception of Sapele Power Station (with AIF 162), these scores were relatively
lower than the Hydro Plants. Nonetheless, facilities for the Thermal Plants would require full
environmental audits to be undertaken.
Other NEPA facilities, such as the Bulk Supply Substations at Kaduna and Kano, indicated
modest AIF cumulative scores of 136 to 138, and would require that partial audits be undertaken.

6.2 Telecommunication Utilities:
The telecommunication sector comprised the two major state-owned carriers, NITEL and M-
TEL. As indicated on EXHIBIT below the facilities for NITEL, in comparison to M-TEL,
indicated high cumulative scores for the AIF between 141 to 158. Therefore, the NITEL facilities
required comprehensive audits to be undertaken, whereas the M-TEL facilities, showing AIF
scores of less than 100, do not require any audits at this time to be undertaken. Other NITEL
facilities indicated modest cumulative scores ranging from tl 4 to 131, and would require partial
audits to be undertaken.

6.3 Transportation Industry:
The international air transport services by Nigeria Airways Limited (NAL) provided scores for
the AIF of less than 140 (i.e. from 129 to 133). The cumulative scores were relatively moderate
and the facilities at Kano and Lagos Airports would require partial audits to be undertaken. The
other facilities at Abuja, Kaduna and Benin City indicated low values for the AIF and would not
require any audits to be undertaken at this time. EXHIBIT below indicates the general
distribution of the AIF for those sites inspected.

7.0 DESCRIPTION OF KEY PRE-AUDIT FINDINGS
7.1 NATIONAL ELECTRIC POWER A UTHORITY(NEPA) Facilities:
The National Electric Power Authority (NEPA) had at the time of the pre-audit assessment,
seven generating stations consisting of three (3) hydro and fpur (4) thermal (gas-fired) facilities.
The hydro power stations were: Kainji, Jebba and Shiroro; and the gas-fired thermal plants were:
Afam, Delta (Ughelli), Lagos (Egbin), and Sapele. The present capacity requirement for Nigeria
from both hydro- and thermal- power stations was 4600 MW. However, during the pre-audit
assessment the total capacity dropped from 2600 MW to 1600 MW.
In addition, NEPA had other facilities such as Bulk Supply Substations, Transmission Lines
and Distribution Systems, as well as, The National Control Center (VCC) located at Oshogbo.
The NCC was responsible for maintaining the good quality of power supply by keeping system
voltages to specifications for the country in order to meet the demand of the average consumer in
load availability in the system while ensuring the supply in every facet of the grid network for
Nigeria. Also, the NCC was to maintain economic loading of generators in order to reduce
production cost, and to enhance system security and reliability.
The key pre-audit findings were as follows:
A. HYDRO POWER STATIONS:
1 Kainji Hydro Power Station:
Background and Initial Conditions:
Kainj i Power Station is a hydroelectric dam on the Niger River located in Niger State of Nigeria.
Four generating units were commissioned in 1968, with two in 1976 and the last two in 1978.
The power station had about 400MW by January 1't 2000, although by the time of the pre-audit
(December, 2000) the capacity had been reduced considerably since most of the generating units
required maintenance and rehabilitation. For instance, none of the eight turbines of the dam was
serviceable during the site visit, and one turbine had been the cause of flooding at the plant few
days prior to the mission.
Key Pre-Audit Findings:
The significant findings were:
Waste (Used) Oil: Waste oil and oil spills from the turbines were found floating into the
reservoir. No contingency plans were available for spill prevention and control. A significant
amount of oil/lubricant spills was observed at the bays of the four proposed new turbines. These
spills were found washed downstream to the reservoir at Jebba.
21



Water Quality: There was visibly high turbidity of the water downstream. There was no
monitoring program related to the environment, such as, sampling for physico-chemical or
microbial parameters of the lake waters or downstream waters.
Estate Management: The estates of the power station for the staff were more or less in the final
stages of decay, the buildings have been erected essentially for the original Construction crews
of the dam as temporary quarters and subsequently allocated as permanent residences. The
conditions of sanitation were poor and potable water supply was a problem. The state of the
buildings and services called for a very detailed study as to whether NEPA should continue
maintaining or replacing the entire outfit.
Environmental Management (Including Regulatory Framework, Capacity Building): There was
very little environmental management system or plan in place for the power station. The liaison
between the Federal ministry of Environment (forrnerly FEPA) and the station was weak, and
there was little knowledge on the regulatory framework with respect to environrnental
management that could guide the activities of the station. Furthermore, there was no senior
personnel directly responsible for environmental management of the station, and hence the need
for capacity building in that regard.
Health and Safety Issues: The power station takes the safety of the workers and visitors very
seriously. Hard hats are provided to all workers and visitors, however, some of the workers were
seen not to use the personal protection equipment, such as ear muffs/plugs, and goggles at all
times inside the plant.
Solid Waste: Metal scraps from abandoned and old vehicles were found at the maintenance yard.
There was poor collection of household wastes at the estates, resulting in illegal dumps on the
properties.
Decommissioning of Equipment and Materials. Several pieces of equipment would need to be
dismantled and transported to safe disposal sites, including obsolete engines, machines, old and
abandoned vehicles, batteries, etc.
Summary of Findings:
The significant environmental pre-audit findings included the following: waste (used) oil getting
into the downstream waters, with no spill contingency plan for prevention and control, and poor
management of waste oil; solid wastes consisting of metal scraps from abandoned engines and
vehicles, pile of discarded metal pieces and old rusted roofs for maintenance areas; poor
management of estate for staff; no environmental management plan/system available for station,
including lack of knowledge on regulatory framework, no liaison with Ministry of Environment,
and no capacity building for environmental services and requirements. The score for the
environmental Audit Index Factors was 192, which placed the station in the highest risk category
and would therefore require a full (comprehensive) audit to be undertaken.
2. Jebba Hydro Power Station:
Background and Initial Conditions:
22



The Jebba Hydro Power Station is located downstream of the Kainj i Hydro Power Station, along
the Niger River in Kwara State of Nigeria. The power station has six (6) generating units that
were commissioned in 1968. The dam, the reservoir and the estates were managed far better than
the other NEPA facilities in terms of infrastructure and operations, as well as estate management.
The water supply system comprised two pumps at the reservoir intake and four pumps at the
treatment plant. The equipment though serviceable had very little life left in them.
Key Pre-Audit Findings:
Estate Management: The station has two camps. The water supply tank/reservoir that served
these camps was severely damaged because it was on the verge of being burst and fractured. The
panels forming the walls of the tank were corroded badly and should be replaced. Vast amount of
water was spewing out of the tank (of the Braithwaite type). The present system should be
replenished from boreholes and a new Braithwaite tank should be installed.
Water Hyacinth: Floating weeds were seen far from the powerhouse and the bridge at the station.
According to the security personnel at the site and the Assistant General Manager, the water
hyacinth is still a major problem even though their presence is minimized at this period of the
year, i.e. towards the end of the rainy season. Some clumps may, therefore, grow in the head
pond area beyond the dam where the water current is lower than elsewhere. The weeds were
likely to be eichornia crassipes, salvinia molesta and/orpistia stratiotes which as a group are
commonly known as water hyacinth, water fern, lettuce, kariba weed or water celery.
Environmental Management: Although a senior personnel has been assigned to be responsible
for the environmental management of the station, there was no consistent environmental
management system or plan being adhered to at the facilities. Also, there was little contact and
no liaison between the national Ministry of Environment (formerly FEPA) and the management
of the station. There was no capacity building for environmental management within the
facilities.
Health and Safety Issues: The facility complied with the standard industrial hygiene codes.
Occasionally, some of the workers were seen without ear muffs/plugs and eye goggles inside the
plant when needed.
Summary of Findings:
The key findings included: disruption of the potable water supply to the two camps of the Jebba
station for the staff and workers as a result of fractured water tank/reservoir; possible
proliferation of water hyacinth at the head pond area of the dam; mediocre environmental
management of the station that needed to be improved and turned into a coherent and consistent
plan or system. The score for the environmental Audit Index Factor (AIF) was 144, making the
station qualify for a full (comprehensive) audit.
3 Shiroro Hydro Power Station:
Background and Initial Conditions:
23



The station is located in Niger State of Nigeria on the Shiroro Gorge along the Kaduna River.
The station has four generating units that were commissioned as follows: one (1) in 1989 and
three (3) in 1990. Only two of the turbines were operational during the visit to the station. Water
hyacinth was of no consequence at this site.
Key Pre-Audit Findings:
Waste (Used) Oil: Waste oil and lubricants at the station were collected into sumps, treated and
re-cycled. However, no contingency plans existed for spill prevention and control to mitigate any
potential losses of fuel.
WVater Quality: There was no sampling and monitoring of physico-chemical and microbial
parameters at the station. Waste (used) water from the station was discharged directly into the
downstream water.
Environmental Management: There was no coherent and consistent environmental management
plan or system for the power station. There was very little interaction or liaison with the national
Ministry of Environment regarding the regulatory framework/ guidelines for environrnental
management. Also, there was no capacity building for environmental management and no
training has been provided in years for anything related to environmental management.
Health and Safety Issues: There was no conscious effort in addressing health and safety issues,
such as worker safety and protection against bodily harm. The standard personal protective
equipment (PPE) of hard hats, ear plugs, boots, and goggles were provided to the workers on
routine basis, however, no supervision was provided to make sure the PPE were used properly
and at all times when required.
Summary of Findings:
The key findings included: upstream activities of the farmers and fishermen, including precious
stone prospectors, could create interference into the operations of the station; no contingency
plans for the management of waste oil and spills; no pollution controls for wastewater effluent to
the downstream water; and no environmental management plan/system for the station.
Environmental Audit Index Factor (AIF) score was 154, placing the facility in the highest risk
category and would require a full (comprehensive) audit.
B. THERMAL (GAS-FIRED) STATIONS:
Site inspections were carried out at Sapele and Lagos (Egbin) Power Stations. Both the Afam
and Ughelli stations were assessed based on information obtained at Sapele and Egbin, and
partially based on senior officials who have worked at these places before.
The pre-audit findings for those sites visited were as follows:
1. Sapele Power Station:
Background and Initial Conditions:
24



The Station is located in Ogorode, Delta State of Nigeria. The Station uses gas-fired turbines to
generate electricity. Six of the turbines (of 120 MW each) were commissioned in 1987 and four
(of 75 MW each) were commissioned in 1991.
There was no monitoring of noise levels within the plant. Thermal/heat radiation is of concern
throughout the plant.
Key Pre-Audit Findings:
Waste (Used) Oil: Oil/lubricants were used in compressors and turbines at the plant. The waste
or used oil from the facilities were collected into sumps and water/oil separators, pre-treated and
re-cycled. There were occasional spills and escape into the canal near by. No contingency plans
existed for spill prevention and control measures.
Wastewater: Effluent water, mostly from the condensers, was discharged into a relatively long
canal in order to let the temperatures cool down before entering downstream water of the Ethiope
River that is a tributary of the Benin River. The water quality of the canal was not monitored at a
consistent level. For instance, there was no monitoring of physico-chemical and microbial
parameters of the water entering the river.
Estate Management: A substantial part of the senior staff residences, including the Acting
General Manager's house, is directly below the high-tension transmission lines. This could lead
to a major hazard due to the electromagnetic effects from the lines and should be discouraged.
Environmental Management: There was no coherent and consistent environmental management
plan or system for the power station. There was very little interaction or liaison with the national
Ministry of Environment regarding the regulatory framework/ guidelines for environmental
management. There was no capacity building for environmental management at the station.
Health and Safety Issues: Standard order issues of personal protective equipment (PPE) such as
boots, hard hats, goggles and ear muffs were provided to the workers at the station, but there was
no supervision of their proper use at the right locations and at the right times when required.
Summary of Findings:
The key pre-audit findings included: thermal/heat radiation was a major concern within the plant;
noise levels required to be monitored; water quality parameters, consisting of temperature,
physico-chemical and microbial parameters, should be monitored before effluent discharge from
canal into the Ethiope River; environrmental management should be incorporated to management
good practices; and residential quarters underneath the transmission lines should be re-allocated
or demolished.
2 Lagos (Egbin) Power Station:
Background and Initial Conditions:
The Station is located in the outskirts of Lagos at Egbin, Lagos State. The Station is the largest
thermal power station in the country. There were six turbines of 220 MW each, with two turbines
commissioned in 1985, two in 1986 and the last two in 1987.
25



Key Pre-Audit Findings:
Waste (Used) Oil: There was no contingency plan for oil spill prevention and control measures
at the facility. The waste oil was collected and re-cycled, although some amount escaped and
mixed with wastewater to become the effluent from the plant.
Wastewater and Water Quality: There was no monitoring of the physico-chemical and microbial
parameters, including temperatures, of the water entering the canal at the plant. A new
installation is in the works for additional gas-fired turbines by Enron (of Texas, USA) near the
plant, and an environmental assessment of possible impacts has been proposed.
Environmental Management: There was no coherent and consistent environmental management
plan or system for the power station. There was very little interaction or liaison with the national
Ministry of Environment regarding the regulatory framework/ guidelines for environmental
management. There was no in-house training or capacity building for environmental
management provided at the power station.
Health and Safety Issues: There was no conscious effort in addressing health and safety issues,
such as worker safety and protection against bodily harm. The standard personal protective
equipment (PPE) of hard hats, ear plugs, boots, and goggles were provided to the workers on
routine basis, however, no supervision was provided to make sure the PPE were used properly
and at all times when required.
Summary of Findings:
The key pre-audit findings included: water quality parameters, consisting of temperature,
physico-chemical and microbial parameters, should be monitored before effluent discharge from
canal into the bay, especially with the coming on board of the proposed new facility by Enron
nearby; thermnal/heat radiation was a major concern within the plant; noise levels required to be
monitored; environmental management should be incorporated into the management good
practices for the station.
7.2 NIGERIAN TELECOMMUNICATIONS LIMITED (NITEL)
General Background and Initial Conditions:
NITEL has been divided into six zones, namely: Lagos Zone with headquarters in Lagos; Central
Zone with headquarters in Abuja; South West Zone with headquarters in Ibadan; South East
Zone with headquarters in Enugu; North East Zone with headquarters in Bauchi and North West
Zone with headquarters in Kaduna. Each State of the Federation of Nigeria and the Federal
Capital represents a Territory. Lagos is however structured into 3 territories. The Corporate
Headquarters are located in Abuja.
NITEL has about 800,000 telephone lines and about 13,000 telex lines in the network. The
digital system was introduced into the network in 1990, and the existing capacity has about
26



450,000 digital lines. Also, NITEL has introduced relatively new services such as Internet
Service and On-Line Billing, as well as, Audio Mail Service and Network Paging Service.
The Central Zone of NITEL with the bulk of the facilities located at Wuse, Abuja, was the most
modern and was typical of the problems encountered nationwide. The zone had about 43
telephone exchanges, out of which 22 were digital and the rest were analogue. The total installed
capacity of the exchanges had about 93,552 lines with 15,268 being analogue and 78,284 being
digital lines. About 65% of the total installed capacity was utilized as at October 2000.
Furthermore, about 554 machines were installed in various locations in the zone, with over 76%
(419) pay phones were functioning and 24% (135) were faulty due to faulty spare parts and lines.
Key Pre-Audit Findings:
Since the facilities for the enterprise were numerous (see EXHBIT 1), only selected areas were
chosen for inspection throughout the country. The facilities inspected were located in the
following areas: Abuja (Wuse), Benin City, Lagos, New Bussa, Ajaokuta, Lokoja, Kaduna,
Kano, Sapele, and some rural areas.
The pre-audit findings were common to the areas, and are described as follows:
Solid Waste Management and Decommissioning of Equipment: Discarded materials and
equipment, such as underground cables and wires, were found at some locations. Analogue
equipment not in use and other obsolete instruments were found at the facilities. It was reported
that there could be old cross bar exchanges at few locations that would require to be
decommissioned. The storage and warehouses contained discarded equipment and materials,
including assortment of batteries, plugs, telecom devices, etc. that needed to be disposed off
properly.
Environmental Management (Including Capacity Building and Regulatory Framework): No
personnel (or senior staff) had been assigned with the responsibility for environmental
management at the facilities. There was no coherent and integrated environmental management
plan or system for the activities pertaining to environmental management, including viable and
executable contingency plans. The liaison between the management and the Ministry of the
Environment (formerly FEPA) was non-existent. Furthermore, there was a lack of awareness on
the environmental laws, regulations and guidelines by the management of the enterprise, and
hence, the regulatory framework for environmental management was virtually non-existent at the
facilities. There was no sufficient training or awareness workshops or seminars on environmental
management provided to the staff and workers of the PE.
Emission andAir Quality: The ventilation in some of the rooms was found to be inadequate.
There was not enough air circulation and the air conditioners were not functioning properly.
Therefore, the humidity was relatively high making the room temperature above normal and
could impact the delicate instruments and equipment.
Health and Safety Issues: Workers were encouraged to make use of personal protective
equipment (PPE) such as boots, hard hats, gloves and goggles. Workers laying cables and
working on transmission lines and towers were supposed to wear protective clothing but did not
have good supervision to enforce the discipline.
27



WVaste Oil and Spill Control/Prevention: Spill contingency plans were unavailable for containing
oil spills (including diesel oil and petroleum) for the zone. Generators were used constantly and
oil/lubricants for the equipment were sometimes spilled on the floors and the areas where the
generators were located.
Summary of Findings:
The key findings included: Lack of contingency plans for oil spill control and protection
measures; inadequate solid waste management including disposal (decommissioning) of obsolete
equipment, such as batteries, old cross bar exchanges; abandoned or discarded analogue
equipment and materials; absence of coherent and consistent environmental management
plan/system; weak contacts with the Ministry of the Environment; lack of knowledge on
regulatory framework; no capacity building program for environmental management; and poor
supervision of worker health and safety issues.
The scores for the environmental Audit Index Factors were as follows: Abuja (141), Benin City
(149), Lagos (158), and New Bussa (149). These scores were high and the facilities would be
required to undertake full (comprehensive) audits.
Other facilities would require partial audits based on the scores for the AIF. These were:
Ajaokuta (114), Lokoja (114), Kaduna (124), Kano (131), and Sapele (122).
7.3 NIGERIAN MOBILE TELECOMMUNICA TIONS LIMITED (M- TEL)
Background and Initial Conditions:
The Nigerian Mobile Telecommunications Limited (M-Tel) was established in January, 1996
and incorporated on 21st May, 1996 as a commercial public enterprise. M-Tel operates TACS
network to provide services in 18 States and plans to extend services to all States of the country
by using digital cellular service (GSM) systems.
The facilities of M-Tel were located at the cellular network of the country as follows: Service
Area I - Lagos; Area II - Enugu; Area III - Abuja; and Area IV - Jos. Most of the original
facilities belonged to NITEL and M-Tel has been "piggy backing" on NITEL facilities
nationwide.
M-TEL was in the process of implementing a National Cellular Network Rehabilitation and
Expansion to provide additional 10,000 lines in Lagos and also extend services to the omitted
parts of the South West, South East, South South, North Central, North West and provide
services to the North East. Furthermore, the enterprise was in the implementation of Area III
(Abuja) network by rehabilitating the infrastructure and replacing the 5,000 lines Mobile
Switching Center (MSC) with a 75,000 lines MSC. Finally, M-TEL has plans to introducing the
Digital Cellular Service (GSM) to provide 400,000 lines and cover all State capitals, highways
and commercial centers in Phase I (2000-2002).
Pre-Audit Findings:
The M-TEL facilities did not require any environmental audits at this time. This situation might
change when the enterprise embarks on the ambitious expansion programs planned for the future.
28



At the minimum, an environmental management plan/system (EMP/S) should be developed and
instituted in-house to address any future environmental problems and issues.
7.4 NIGERIA AIR WA YS LIMITED (NAL):
Background and Initial Conditions:
Nigeria Airways is currently undergoing drastic re-structuritig and as a result, all its equipment is
down. The few offices operating in the country were at low level of service. Site inspections for
the pre-audit assessment were conducted at Kano, Kaduna, Lagos, Abuja, and Benin City.
Key Pre-Audit Findings:
It was determined that the facilities at Kano Airport and Lagos Airport required partial audits to
be undertaken. No audits were required to be undertaken for the facilities in Abuja, Benin City,
and Kaduna.
The observations below were common to both facilities in Kano and Lagos. These were as
follows:
Waste (Used) Oil: Waste or used oil from the maintenance operations and from the
rehabilitation of equipment were poorly collected and hadly re-cycled. At Kano the waste oil
were simply allowed to drain into the sewers at the airport. There was no contingency plans for
oil spill prevention and control measures. Generators were used constantly and oil/lubricants for
the equipment were sometimes spilled on the floors and the areas where the generators were
located.
Health and Safety Issues: Health and Safety Issues: Workers were encouraged to make use of
personal protective equipment (PPE) such as boots, hard hats, gloves and goggles. Workers on
maintenance equipment were supposed to wear protective clothing but did not have good
supervision to enforce the discipline.
Environmental Management (Including Capacity Building and Regulatory Framework): No
personnel had been assigned with the responsibility for environmental management at the
facilities. There was no coherent and integrated environmental management plan or system for
the activities pertaining to environmental management, including viable and executable
contingency plans. The liaison between the management and the Ministry of the Environment
(formerly FEPA) was non-existent. There was a lack of awareness on the environmental laws,
regulations and guidelines by the management of the enterprise, and hence, the regulatory
framework for environmental management was virtually non-existent at the facilities. There was
no capacity building and no sufficient training or awareness workshops or seminars on
environmental management provided to the staff and workers of the PE.
Summary of Findings:
The main findings included: lack of contingency plans for oil spill control and protection
measures; inadequate solid waste management including disposal (decommissioning) of obsolete
29



equipment, such as batteries, engines, vehicles; absence of coherent and consistent
environmental management plan/system; weak contacts with the Ministry of the Environment;
lack of knowledge on regulatory framework; no capacity building program for environmental
management; and poor supervision of worker health and safety issues.
7.5 NATIONAL CONTROL CENTER, OSHOGBO:
Background and Initial Conditions:        - 
The National Control Center (NCC) located at Oshogbo is responsible for maintaining the good
quality of power supply by keeping system voltages to specifications for the country. The goal of
the specifications was to meet the demand of the average consumer in load availability in the
system while ensuring the supply in every facet of the grid network for Nigeria. Also, the NCC
was to maintain economic loading of generators in order to reduce production cost, and to
enhance system security and reliability.
Furthermore, the NCC was to organize and release generators and transmission equipment for
maintenance purposes in schedule manner to avert breakdown while in service.
Potential Pre-Audit Findings:
Although there was no time during the pre-audit mission to inspect the NCC site at Oshogbo, the
review and evaluation of the necessary information indicated the following militating
constraints:
There was insufficient generation to cope with the national power demand since generation is
very low. Many key equipment mal-functioned on regular basis, such as the Automatic Voltage
Regulation (A.V.R.s), and the Governor Systems in Kainji Power Station generators have broken
down.
Other problems were that of Transmission Lines that trip every dry season time due to bush
burning. This posed a serious threat to system stability and to Generator health and life span.
Furthermore, it was disclosed that the Kainji Kaplan Units and Delta Black Stating Units needed
to be quickly restored with their Governors. There was lack of system monitoring facility at the
NCC. Most of the equipment was bad, old and obsolete, and needed to be decommissioned.
There was no single measure and meter functioning.
It appeared the digital frequency counter was the only working meter for frequency control, and
for ordering emergency load shedding to save the system from collapse. The 330kV transmission
lines must be cleared always of fouling trees and agents and protected from bush burners.
Although the environmental Audit Index Factors for the site were not determined, the facility at
NCC should undergo comprehensive (full) audit, since the site was a sensitive area to the power
generation of Nigeria.

8. SCREENING OF OTHER PUBLIC ENTERPRISES
The current Privatization program by BPE envisages the fuill or partial divestment of interest in
about eighty-six (86) Public Enterprises in which the Federal Government owns minority or
controlling interest. These enterprises have been scheduled in the public Enterprises
(Privatization and Commercialization) Act No. 28 of 1999 and are reproduced below.
The eighty-six (86) public enterprises have been screened as to whether environmental audits
were to be conducted as part of the commercialization and privatization processes. No site visits
were conducted and the preliminary screening was based on the nature and scope of the activities
carried out by the enterprises.
The probable results of the preliminary screening were as follows:

Comments on the Screening of PEs:
Without knowing the particular activities of the industries listed under AFRICAN
INVESTMENTS, they have been listed as requiring full audits, in order to be consistent with the
other industries in sugar, cement and chemicals.
Although The Tafawa Balewa Square Investments Ltd. under DEFENCE has been placed as
requiring a full audit, this status can only be confirmed when a pre-audit has been carried out.
The specific (particular) activities of the enterprise could not be deternined at this time.
9. DECOMMISSIONING PLANS
During the pre-audit assessment it was observed that all the enterprises would require some form
of decommissioning of old equipment and materials. Some of the equipment comprised: old
plants, control panels; vehicles; tanks; and buildings that may need demolishing. It is
recommended that undertaking actual decommissioning plans for each enterprise must be
evaluated and the costs be deternined during the comprehensive audits.
10. STATUTORY FRAMEWORK
This chapter has been devoted to reviewing and evaluating the laws and regulations by which the
Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE) and the relevant government agencies, such as the Ministry
of the Environment (MOE), would have the capacity to monitor and enforce existing regulations
and execute remediation plans within the process of privatization of Public Enterprises.
The policy initiatives of the Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN) have been geared towards the
framework of the country's natural resource management policies for integrating environmental
concerns into the private sector plans, programs and development actions.
These initiatives are summarized as follows:
10.1 National Policy on the Environment:
As indicated in the chapter on Environmental Setting (i.e. Chapter 3), the FGN has taken a
number of steps to address various environmental problems in the country. In 1989, the FGN
formulated a National Policy on Environment that led to the establishment of the Federal
Environmental Protection Agency (FEPA), through Decree No. 58 of 1988 as amended by
Decree 59 of 1992 and further amended by Decree 14 of 1999 with the mandate for the overall
responsibility towards ensuring a good quality environment for Nigeria. Since then FEPA has
been absorbed into the Ministry of the Environment and no longer operates as a separate or
indepcndcnt agcncy.
In addition, the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Decree No. 86 of 1992 was
promulgated. Also, it is generally understood that the National Policy on Environment should
36



strengthen the consultative and advisory roles of the National Council on the Environment and
the State Environmental Protection Agencies (SEPA) and other institutions.
These initiatives, coupled with the policies on energy and electricity, provided a strong linkage
of the utility reform and re-structuring with the environmental management of Nigeria
appropriate for the privatization and commercialization of the enterprises within the sectors.
The revised policy is based on fundamental re-thinking and a clearer appreciation of the
interdependent linkages among development processes, environmental factors as well as human
and natural resources. It is recognized that the actions and activities designed to increase the
productivity of the society and meet the essential needs of the populace must be reconciled with
environmental issues that had hitherto been neglected or not given sufficient attention.
Other important initiatives include the following:
o National Guidelines for Environmental Audit in Nigeria (1999);
o National Guidelines on Environmental Management System in Nigeria (1999);
o  Environmental Impact Assessment Sectoral Guidelines: Oil and Gas;
Infrastructures, and Agriculture and Rural Development (1995);
o  The Electricity Act (1927 revised 1975);
o  Report of Technical Committee on Privatization of NEPA (2000);
o  Action Plan for Transmission Sub-Sector to Improve Power Supply (April 2000);
o  National Electricity Policy Draft (November 2000).
10.2 National Agenda 21:
Nigeria's Agenda 21 of 1999 was a blue print of action from now on into the 215' century and
beyond by Government, UN development agencies, NGOs and independent sector groups in
every area in which human activity impacts on the environment.
The objectives of Nigeria's Agenda 21 seek to:
i.    Integrate environment into development planning at all levels of
government and the private sector,
ii.   Intensify the transition to sustainable development;
iii.   Address sectoral priorities, plans, policies and strategies for the major
sectors of the economy; and
iv.   Simultaneously foster regional and global partnerships.
In combating environmental problems, sustainable development practices and policies have
become integral parts of the planning process of the FGN. Redressing the backlog of
environmental problems, however, remains a central concern for both the people and the
different levels of government.
37



10.3 Telecommunication:
In 1998 the Ministry of Communications approved the National Policy on Telecommunications
and refined (revised) in 2000. In order to promote the policy goals of total liberalization,
competition and the private sector-led growth of the telecommunications sector, a 22 member
Telecommunications Sector Reform Implementation Committee (TSRIC) was inaugurated in
February 2000.                                  %
The policy, supported by the National Council on Privatization (NCP), is part of the current trend
of globalization and convergence in the telecommunications industry where the country
(Nigeria) needs a more proactive policy that recognizes international best practices.
Between 1960 and 1985, the telecommunications sector consisted of the Department of Posts and
Telecommunications (P & T) in charge of the internal network and a limited liability company,
the Nigerian External Telecommunications (NET) Limited, responsible for the external
telecommunications services.
In January 1985, the erstwhile P&T was split into Postal and Telecommunications Divisions.
The latter was merged with NET to form Nigerian Telecommunications Limited (NITEL), a
limited liability company, while the Postal Division was reconstituted into another organization
called the Nigerian Postal Service (NIPOST). The main objective of establishing NITEL was to
harmonize the planning and co-ordination of the internal and external telecommunications
services, rationalize investments in telecommunications development and provide accessible,
efficient and affordable services.
10.4 The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC):
This commission was established under the Decree 75 of 1992, whose main objective included
creating a regulatory environment to facilitate the supply of telecommunication services and
facilities. The NCC has set out guidelines for undertaking, among others, the provision and
operation of private network links employing cable, radio communications, or satellite within
Nigeria.
In 1996 the Nigerian Mobile Telecommunications Limited (M-TEL) was separated from the
NITEL. M-TEL is the only mobile cellular telephony network in the country, although a total of
twelve other mobile cellular operators have been issued licenses but only a few have commenced
limited operations while approvals have also been given for the issuance of licenses to 21 other
operators.
The role of the FGN in the telecommunications sector includes giving the overall direction for
the telecommunications development; the Ministry of Communications formulates broad
telecommunications policy by proposing policy options and recommending to Government such
measures as legislation, fiscal incentives, overall monitoring of the radio spectrum allocation in
the country, etc.
38



It has been proposed that a National Frequency Management Council (NFMC) be established
and liaise with the NCC and the Nigerian Broadcasting Commission (NBC) on the assignment of
frequencies.
10.5 Relevance of the Statutory Framework in the Privatization of PEs in Nigeria:
To meet the national energy needs through increased use of hydropower and gas-fired plants and
improved efficiency of energy use, the FGN has stated that the private sector should be
encouraged to generate and distribute hydro-electricity by removing the monopoly ingenerating,
transmitting and distributing from NEPA; encourage industries/institutions to switch to hydro
and gas-fired energy sources, and discourage the use of traditional fuel-wood that increases de-
forestation by supplying electricity to rural communities. The national legislation, taken together,
addressed the need for the lead agency (in this case NEPA and NITEL) to promote the use of
renewable sources of energy by creating necessary incentives, and to take measures for the
conservation on non-renewable sources of energy by encouraging the planting of trees and wood
lots by individual land users, institutions and community groups.
10.6 Legal Framework on Liabilities:
The Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE) must work closely with the Ministry of the Environment
(MOE) to ascertain who assumes the responsibilities for environmental liabilities at the PEs. For
instance, do the liabilities fall on the new owners or on the former owners? It appears the laws of
Nigeria are silent on these issues, and hence BPE and MOE must determine the appropriate
law(s) covering environmental liabilities with respect to: privatization policy, due diligence, and
indemnification, so that there would be a clear understanding of who is liable for contamination,
both past, current and in the future, i.e. during and after divestiture.
10. 7 Monitoring Protocols:
Although environmental audit has been proposed as a legal requirement in the National
Guidelines for Environmental Audit in Nigeria (as amended by Decree No. 14, 1999), the
capacity of auditors in Nigeria is still small at both the regulatory and private sector levels. In the
few cases that have carried out environmental audits the enterprises have relied on overseas
auditors, a situation that is not economically sustainable. Hence, capacity building must be
created at all levels for environmental audits in Nigeria.
There were lack of standards for monitoring environmental parameters, for instance, for
measuring water quality and air quality for Nigeria. Therefore, the individual PEs has been
conducting self-monitoring using standards that were not consistent. The MOE must be
responsible for determining and preparing guidelines and environmental performance indicators
that are measurable for monitoring sites and facilities of the PEs.
39



The performance indicators can serve as the instrument for responding to any potential
environmental hazard that may occur as a result of activities by the enterprises. Furthermore,
MOE must set up a monitoring and accountability protocol that would require either monthly,
quarterly or yearly reporting from the PEs with respect to addressing significant mitigation
measures and meeting the environmental management challenges of the enterprises.
11. TRAINING AND CAPACITY BUILDING
A "training of trainers" program should be developed and provided to the personnel of the
enterprises, preferably the senior management staff, on environmental management in the
context of good management practices. The "train the trainers" sessions for the senior officials in
the short term would provide the vehicle to provide, in turn, long-term training to the staff and
workers of the enterprises. The training could also form the basis for developing capacity
building within the enterprises. The initial training could be provided by a qualified
local/national environmental management consultant/firm, with support provided by an
international consultant.
The training must be a part of the environmental auditing for the privatization process. The
relevance of the training program is to ensure that the management personnel of the PEs
appreciate the need for environmental auditing and monitoring. Also the training will ensure that
conditions of good management practices are adhered to, mitigation measures are effectively
applied and the benefits expected from environmental management are achieved in order for the
privatization processes to be sustainable. .
The targeted audience should be the senior management of all the PEs. It is anticipated that the
training will be initiated after the completion of the audits. The training should be seen as part of
capacity building for the environmental auditing in the privatization processes, and therefore,
should be borne or financed as part of the costs for the audits for the NPSP. This project should
include components to strengthen the institutional capacity through training.
The following are the details for conducting environmental training and awareness
workshops/seminars for the management staff of the PEs, as part of the environmental audits of
the enterprises. Since environmental management is absent at majority of the enterprises, it is
highly recommended that the senior management be provided with training on environmental
management practices that will underpin the desired environmental audits of the PEs. It is
suggested that this "training of trainers" format be extended to the senior management of all the
four key enterprises.
The components should cover the following areas:
- Information on national Environmental Regulations and Guidelines for the
enterprises of Nigeria;
- Training and Awareness of Environmental Management and Good Practices for
the enterprises through national workshops, seminars and training of trainers
sessions;
40



- Institutional Strengthening and Capacity Building of Ministry of the Environment
(formerly FEPA) to coordinate with enterprises on environmental management;
- How to conduct environmental auditing every year of all enterprises, followed
by training sessions on good practices for environmental management.
Training Programs
Description of Technical Assistance
The Training and Awareness Programs on Environmental Management and Good
Practices should be held after the completion of the environmental audits of the PEs.
Participants for the workshops and seminars should be drawn from the management of the
various privatization candidates/ enterprises, as well as those already privatized. The Train the
Trainers sessions should cover:
- the management of environmental information,
- applicable environmnental laws and regulations of Nigeria,
- international environmental assessments and auditing,
- environmental management systems/plans (ISO 9000, 14000)
The training may cover areas such as, compliance with company policies, procedures and good
management practices; landuse planning, social and resettlement issues; regulations on the
environment with respect to health and safety issues for workers; medical monitoring; hazardous
materials handling, safe disposal and transportation; and environmental database management,
information technology, and reporting.
BUDGET
The training involving workshops and seminars will require a budget not to exceed one million
dollars (US$1,000,000.00). The cost estimates cover the training for participants from all the
Public Enterprises, and not limited to only the four key ones of NEPA, NITEL, M-TEL, and
NIGERIA AIRWAYS LTD.
Each PE must bear the cost for its participants, such as, their travel, and subsistence expenses,
honorarium, hotel, etc. A total of three international consultants and a similar number for
local/national experts would be required to conduct the training exercises. Also, about three to
four training sessions within the year may be conducted across the country. The format and
details for the training should be left to both BPE and MOE.
The breakdown is as follows:
Professional Fees for International Consultants ........   US$600,000.00
Professional Fees for Local Experts and Consultants..      200,000.00
Miscellaneous for international travel, etc.               200,000.00
Total                                             US$1,000,000.00
41



12. INTER-AGENCY RELATIONSHIPS:
An inter-agency cooperation, especially between the Ministry of the Environment (formerly
National Environmental Protection Agency, FEPA) and the Bureau of Public Enterprises of the
National Council of Privatization, would provide the best means of coordinating, supervising and
benefiting from the various actions being conducted by different agencies and institutions
relating to the environmental management of public enterprises.
Ideally, the inter-agency relationship (working through committees) should be formally instituted
under the leadership of BPE, and should involve national, State, and local government agencies
and institutions which have interests, skills and experience to deal with the wide range of
complex environmental and social issues associated with significant environmental management
issues, such as for example, hydro power development and gas-fired thermal plants.
The relationship should include agencies that comprise: water; energy; oil and gas; agriculture;
physical planning; human resettlement and land use planning; health and labor; finance; and
regulatory framework.
BPE should liaise with the Ministry of the Environmnent by setting up advisory panels or
committees. The activities of the panel could be expanded to accommodate the appropriate areas
of concern for BPE. For instance, the geographical information system ((IS) capabilities of the
Ministry of the Environment may be utilized to develop a pollution potential mapping and the
characterization of contamination vulnerability for the vicinities of the public enterprises.

13.7 CLARIFICATION OF COSTESTIMATES.
The overall cost estimates for carrying out the relevant tasks associated with the environmental
auditing of the PEs, with respect to the privatization processes for NEPA, NITEL, and Nigeria
Airways Limited, is not to exceed one million two hundred and fifty thousand dollars
(US$1,250,000.00).
44



The stated amounts refer to the following audit action items:
-  conduct of the full audits and partial audits for NEPA (US$525,000.00);
-  conduct full audits and partial audits for NITEL (US$300,000.00);
-  conduct full audit at NCC (US$75,000.00);
-  conduct partial audits for NIGERIA AIRWAYS LIMITED (US$100,000.00);
-  hire Environmental Advisor (US$250,000.00).
The audit estimates do not include preparation of decommissioning plans (DP). During the
audits there should be assessment as to the need for a DP. However, when that need is
established a decommissioning plan (including preparation costs) must be undertaken for that
enterprise separate from the audit, and must be costed separately from the costs for the audits.
The costs do not include implementation of any mitigation measures, such as rehabilitation of
estates at Kainji and installation of a new water supply system at Jebba for NEPA. The key
remedial and mitigation measures stated in the report are the measures being recommended to be
investigated, at the minimum, that would require to be confirmned during the full environmental
audits at the various sites for each PE, for example the decommissioning plans. The costs for
implementation and financing of mitigation measures will be determined separately in each audit
as appropriate
During the conduct of the full audits, the cost evaluations would include estimates of capital and
operating expenses associated with remedial actions along with an implementation schedule. In
general, if at all possible the cost data on operation and maintenance (O & M) and other recurrent
costs should be made available during the full audits. It may be difficult to separate operating
and recurrent costs from capital costs during the audits. However, it is important to obtain the
information to make meaningful cost comparisons between simplified systems and other
alternatives.
The cost estimates for the proposed full environmental audits and partial audit will involve the
following:
Number of consultants: Four to Six Environmental Professionals with knowledge on technical,
engineering, economic, financial, legal, labor and sociological background drawn from
international firms; and about five local experts with similar background and as part of the
international team.
Other Direct Charges (ODC): These charges consist of travel and subsistence expenses,
laboratory analysis where needed, local transportation, report preparation, leasing of field
equipment and instruments where appropriate, etc. The ODC would be from 15% to 20% of the
overall costs.
Period of Performance: The period of performance for the audits should be from six to nine
months, covering about twelve hundred (1000) person days. The Professional Fees should be
negotiable for all consultants, with suggested average daily rate of US$1000 (for international
consultants) and US$450 (for domestic consultants).

14. A ROAD MAP FOR ENVIRONMENTAL
MANAGEMENT
OF DIVESTITURE PROCESSES OF PUBLIC
ENTERPRISES
14.1 Environmental Guidelines and Requirements
Background:
This 'road map' for environmental management should be considered as part of the overall
guidelines that will assist the BPE in future privatization transactions. Taken together with
ANNEXE A, the road map will help the EnvironmentalAdvisor (to be hired) provide the
necessary guidance for the due diligence processes during the preparation for divestiture of
enterprises. ANNEXE A details the guidelines for conducting environmental audits during the
due diligence processes.
46



14.2 Proposed Road Map:
As part of the due diligence and integral part of advisory work to help with the divestiture
preparation for each public enterprise for comprehensive audits, the following steps would be
required:
Conduct pre-audit assessment by ranking the enterprises for the need for
Comprehensive audits (CA), partial audits (PA), and no audits (NA);
Prepare the Terms of Reference (TOR) for CA and PA;
Prepare procurement/bidding packages for audits and partial audits;
Conduct Comprehensive (full) audits and Partial audits;
Indicate key audit findings and action plan for mitigation;
Prepare cost estimates for each action plan;
At this stage, the TOR for the Comprehensive Audits must include the breakdown of
environmental liabilities into past, on-going, and future operations of the audited enterprises.
Furthermore, recommendations must be made as to who should pay for the environmental
liabilities incurred by the various enterprises.
If dams are involved in the activities of the facilities, there must be a an overview of dam safety
at the relevant enterprises, with a reference to the World Bank's safeguard policy in this regard.
At this point inter-agency cooperation is needed, especially with the Ministry of the
Environment:
*     Develop plan for Contingent Liabilities;
Develop plan for Sampling Protocol;
Develop plan for Perfornance Indicators;
Estimate costs for all recommended action plans;
*     Develop plan for environmental management systemn/plan for facilities;
At this stage it is essential to determine the need for decommissioning of equipment (either old,
obsolete, or alternative usage). The decommissioning plan must adhere to the World Bank
standards and guidelines that require that a fully costed environmental assessment be conducted
for the dismantling, packaging and disposal of materials to safe sites and locations.
Identify need for decommissioning plans (DP);
Develop TOR for DP;
Prepare procurement/bids for DP.
15. CONSULTATION WITH STAKEHOLDERS
Consultation with stakeholders were carried out whenever possible during the field inspections
of various facilities and sites across the country. There was a lack of knowledge about the
privatization and commercialization processes currently being pursued by BPE at most of the
47



facilities in the rural and urban areas. In general it was observed that at the NEPA and NITEL
facilities inspected no new lands were required within the existing boundaries, and that
resettlement of displaced persons have been taken care of long time ago.
Kainji Dam Site: It was found that the transmission lines at the vicinity of the Kainji dam site
were too low and too close to the ground. There was prevalence of crop farming being carried
out by the local people under the transmission lines and along the access roads. This situation
could be dangerous and should be addressed by re-locating these farmers away from the
transmission lines.
Sapele Power Station: The residences for the senior staff, including that of the Acting General
Manager (AGM), Mr. A.A. Adeniyi, were directly under the high-tension (132kV) transmission
lines. There was a meeting with the staff and was advised to re-locate to safer area since the
transmission lines could impact them negatively due to electromagnetic effects.
NITEL Facilities: The consultation revealed that extensive farming of crops was a common
occurrence around the tower bases, access roads, and storage sites wherever NITEL facilities
were located in the rural areas. Although the 'right-of-way' clearances were being used by
farmers for crop production, they did not appear to be of any major hazard to the environment.
Since these areas were old, existing facilities a detailed Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) were
not required because it could not be determined whether any persons have been affected socially
and economically. .
Finally, the consultation indicated that most of the potential persons that could have been
displaced previously have their livelihoods and standard of living at least restored in real terms to
pre-displacement levels.
16. RECOMMENDATION
1. Based on the environmental pre-audits conducted for the four key public enterprises in
Nigeria, it is recommended that comprehensive (full) audits be undertaken for the following
facilities:
National Electric Power A uthority (NEPA):
The Hydro Power Stations located at Jebba, Kainji and Shiroro;
The Thermal (Gas-Fired) Power Stations located at Afam, Delta (Ughelli), Lagos (Egbin), and
Sapele.
Nigerian Telecommunications Limited (NITEL):
Facilities located at Abuja, Benin City, Lagos and New Bussa.
National Control Center (NCC):
Facilities located at Oshogbo
48



2. Partial audits must be carried out for the following facilities:
National Electric Power Authority (NEPA):
The Bulk Supply Substations located at Kaduna and Kano, as well as other major bulk supply
substations in the country;
Nigerian Telecommunications Limited (NITEL):
Facilities located at Ajaokuta, Lokoja, Kaduna, Kano and Sapele/Benin City area.
Nigeria Airways Limited (NAL):
Facilities located at Lagos and Kano airports.
3. No audits were required for the facilities belonging to M-TEL, other facilities for Nigeria
Airways located at Abuja, Kaduna and Benin City. Furthermore, it was assumed that the other
facilities belonging to NEPA and NITEL, particularly in the rural areas, would not require any
audits at this time, based on a random 'drive through' observations during the site visits across
the country.
4. It is recommended that the rehabilitation of Kainji Estates and installation of a new water
supply for Jebba Power Station must be negotiated as part of the divestiture arrangements with
the new owners, or can be borne by the government. Either way, these are major issues that need
to be addressed urgently. The estate management findings for Kainji and Jebba must be seen as
posing significant environmental liabilities for the enterprise, and hence should be part of any
future mitigation measures to be addressed in the future.
5. Decommissioning Plans: During the pre-audit assessments, it was observed that all the
enterprises would require some form of decommissioning of old equipment and materials. Some
of the equipment comprised: cranes, old plants, control panels, and batteries. It is recommended
that undertaking actual decommissioning plans for each site must be evaluated and the costs be
determined during the comprehensive audits.
6. Legal Framework and Contingent Liabilities: The Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE)
must work closely with the Ministry of the Environment (MOE) and other appropriate and
relevant government agencies, in order to determine who assumes the responsibilities for
environmental liabilities at the enterprises, and whether the liabilities fall on the new owners or
on former owners at the time of divestiture. It is recommended that the former owners bear the
liabilities of past actions before they hand over to the private sector, or the cost for
remediation/mitigation measures must be deducted out of the privatization cost
7. Guidelines and Environmental Performance Indicators: The Bureau of Public Enterprises
(BPE) must hire an Environmental Advisor who will assist in providing guidance on
determining and preparing environmental performance indicators that are measurable and
monitorable for the privatization candidates. The Ministry of the Environment (MOE) can be
contacted to provide supervision where appropriate in the monitoring of the measurable
environmental indicators for the sites. Also, the Environmental Advisor will assist in using the
49



guidelines (see ANNEXE A) in collaboration with the Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE),
should enable the latter determine the environmental requirements of future privatization
candidates by combining with its own road map or guidelines as spelt out in this report. The
Environmental Advisor can be hired for US$250,000.00 for a period of three years.
8. Guidelines for Environmental Management in Divestiture: As part of the divestiture of
public enterprises, the 'road map' or guidelines proposed must be used by BPE to assist in
supporting the integration of environmental management within the privatization processes for
the current and future candidates. The road map should be taken together with the guidelines in
ANNEXE A to maximize the appropriate guidance needed with the help of the Environmental
Advisor.
9. Training: It is recommended that the Environmental Advisor develop an appropriate training
program for the senior management of all the enterprises as part of the guidelines for
environmental management in the divestiture processes for the privatization candidates.
10. Environmental Management Systems/Plans: Each enterprise must have on its premise a
Senior Official responsible for environmental management activities, and liaise with the MOE on
environmental laws and regulations pertaining to the activities of the enterprise and participate in
training and be part of the capacity building for environmental management. The Environmental
Advisor should include the EMS/P in the guidelines for the divestiture processes for the
privatization candidates.
11. The Environmental Advisor to be hired must coordinate and support the development of
contingency plans that link city/urban contingency plans with that of the enterprise. Furthermore,
it is recommended that the enterprises develop and incorporate environrnental management
systems/plans (EMS/P) into its management structure. The EMS/P must include elements such
as:
- execution of environmental monitoring programs for the enterprises;
- knowledge and compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations;
- conduct occasional drills to alert the staff and workers on how to react and operate in cases of
emergencies;
- conduct training and awareness programs as part of good management practices while
promoting capacity building within the enterprise;
- develop the capacity to execute coherent sampling and monitoring programs as part of
remediation plans;
and
- carry out medical monitoring, while including HIlV/AIDS awareness programs.
12. Period of Performance: The comprehensive and partial environmental audits of the
enterprises must be completed prior to the divestiture of each enterprise. However, the
implementation of the audit action plans and decommissioning plans must be negotiated with the
appropriate interested partners as part of the full divestiture of each enterprise. This means that
the execution of any proposed audit action plans need not be completed prior to negotiations.
The implementation schedules can be determined during the negotiation of the loans in the
privatization process.
50



13. Cost Estimates: The overall costs for conducting the necessary and appropriate elements of
the Environmental Auditing Programs for Privatization are not to exceed one million two
hundred and fifty hundred thousand dollars (i.e. US$1,250,000.00).
The cost estimates can be broken into:
cost for comprehensive audits for NEPA facilities - US$425,000.00;
cost for comprehensive audits for NITEL facilities - US$200,000.00;
cost for comprehensive audits for NCC, Oshogbo (also for NEPA) - US$75,000.00;
cost for partial audits for NEPA facilities - US$100,000.00;
cost for partial audits for NITEL facilities -US$100,000.00;
cost for partial audits for NIGERIA AIRWAYS facilities - US$100,000.00;
cost for Environmental Advisor to develop guidelines and monitoring protocols -
US$250,000.00

ANNEXE A:
A.] GUIDELINES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL A UDITING:
A. 1.1 Background:
These guidelines have been developed for use in conjunction with the 'road map' (Chapter 14 of
this report) for conducting environmental audits as part of the due diligence preparation in the
divestiture of public enterprises.
A. 1.2 COMPREHENSIVE (FULL) AUDITS AND PARTIAL AUDITS:
The environmental comprehensive (full) audit must provide support and guidance in the
preparation of the due diligence liabilities in the divestiture of privatization candidates.
The objectives must include the following:
* determine the potential pre-existing, on-going, and future environmental liabilities prior to
divestiture;
*  measure the enterprise environmental conditions against the risk of being held responsible
for contingent
damages after privatization;
* review the national legislative framework to ascertain the roles of the privatization candidate
and the
new investors on clean-up responsibilities at divestiture.
Specific environmental indicators should include the environmental audit index factors that
comprise:
Type of Enterprise (i.e. activities at facilities and sites)
Emissions and Air Quality
Wastewater (i.e. impact on surface water and groundwater receptors)
*     Waste Oil and Spill Control Measures
*     Solid Waste
Noise
Occupational Health and Safety Issues
57



*     Environmental Management and Regulatory Framework
*     Capacity Building, Training and Awareness
The above factors must be assessed against the overall affects on pollution potential for the sites
and facilities by considering the following components:
*     Depth to water;
*     Soil and aquifer media;
*     Topography;
*     Impact on land-use and planning;
*     Impact on wetlands and water bodies; and
*     Impact on workers
Also, the factors should include solid waste management and sanitation; land-use and habitation
management (i.e. settlement/resettlement issues); occupational health and safety issues;
wastewater and sewerage management on properties; emission and air quality management; used
oil and waste oil management; and the overall environmental management (including capacity
building, regulatory and legislative framework) of the privatization candidates.
The environmental full audits must be carried out in two phases: first phase to collect historical
information and documentation; phase two should involve detailed physical sampling and where
contamination is identified, the issue of remediation and clean-up will be dictated by the number
of factors such as legislation, future land use, risk of contaminants spreading and possible
impacts on human health and the environment.
Specifically, the environmental full audit must include the following:
* Carry out a detailed assessment of the biophysical, geological and geophysical issues
pertaining to the privatization candidate, such as land-use and planning alternatives that directly
or indirectly impact on the environment;
* Identify all significant environmental and occupational health and safety concerns related to
both past and on-going activities;
 Prepare a prioritized list (i.e. high, medium, and low) of concerns related to past activities;
* Prepare a prioritized list (i.e. high, medium, and low) of concerns related to on-going
activities;
* For both past and on-going environmental concerns, provide recommendations and
estimated costs on what rehabilitation and clean-up measures are required in view of
privatization;
*   Review the capacity of the Federal Government and the Ministry of the Environment
(MOE) capabilities to monitor the responsibilities for known or contingent environmental
damages and pre-existing environmental problems;
*  Determine who assumes the cost for liabilities;
* Provide recommendations and cost estimates for the past and on-going activities in relation
to Nigeria and The World Bank safeguard policies;
*  Determine who is responsible for developing measurable and monitorable environmental
performance indicators for the privatization candidates; and
Determine who enforces the monitoring of the audit action items.
58



Decommissioning Plans: If it is determined that equipment needs to be dismantled, packaged
and transported to safe disposal sites, a decommissioning plan must be developed, adhering to
the World Bank Safeguard policies with fully undertaken environmental assessment and fully
developed cost estimates.
Training and Capacity Building: Training of personnel for environmental management for the
Privatization Candidates must be assessed as part of the full audit, and if found to be necessary,
training programs must be developed for the enterprise personnel. The cost estimates must be
provided for the training and awareness programs on environmental laws and regulations and on
good management practices for the privatization candidates.
Institutional Strengthening: The full audits can be used to develop institutional strengthening of
the country's environmental management (i.e. the Ministry of the Environment) capabilities by
retaining technical assistance (through the hiring of an Environmental Advisor to BPE) in order
to develop measurable performance indicators for the various facilities, conduct sampling
protocols, and develop monitoring schedules for enforcement of audit actions, both curTently and
in the future. The technical assistance can be acquired from local/national environmental
consultants and from research institutions like the local/national Universities.
