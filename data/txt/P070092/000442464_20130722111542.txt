1.     ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT

1.1    Introduction

          An initial Environmental Impact Assessment has been carried out to identify critical issues, its
          impact and mitigation measures and preparation of Environment Management Plan. In this
          context, the general policies, guidelines, codes of practices provided in the Environmental and
          Social Screening and Assessment Framework (ESSAF), which is consistent to Bank
          operational policies and procedures has been followed. The present project focuses on repair,
          rehabilitation, reconstruction and upgradation of part of damaged roads including cross
          drainage structures (Irish Crossings/ Culverts) mostly located on wadis.


          Considering the nature and magnitude of reconstruction works, potential environmental impacts
          are likely to be negligible except some minor impacts on air pollution are likely to occur during
          construction including increase in noise level which is temporary. There is no requirement of
          land acquisition and also no need of involuntary resettlement. Therefore, no major impacts are
          anticipated and hence the proposed operations under the project are likely to be classified
          under Category B as per the World Bank operational policies, 1999. Under the Yemeni
          Environmental Regulations, the project falls under Category 2.


          Overall, the project has beneficial effect. Significance of environmental impacts arising due to
          ‘With Project’ and ‘Without Project’ has been evaluated based on environmental parameters.
          Table 1.1 shows the significance of environmental impacts. However, any adversities arising
          from the project implementation and operation can be mitigated/ reduced by mitigating
          measures at the design stage.


1.2   Project Description

 1.2.1 Description of the existing road

        The existing roads under the contracts are found to be badly damaged at various locations by the
        flash floods. The types of damages noted in the existing roads are detailed below:
                 The most observed common damages are erosion of embankment slope and shoulders.
                  At some locations, such erosions are severe resulting damage of part of pavements.



                                                         1-2

FPERP-RR1, RR2, RR3, & RR4                               1/Environmental Impact Assessment & Safeguard Procedures


                Inadequate slope protection works both in fill and cut has resulted in wash out/ erosion of
                 one or both sides of the road. This has resulted at certain stretches, total wash out of the
                 road.
                Minor damages to road pavements and shoulders occurred due to infiltration of water
                 into the pavement layers thereby loosening the base layers which has resulted in
                 pavement settlement.
                Irish crossings were observed to be partly or fully damaged.
                The flood carried debris which blocked the opening of single or multi-cell box culverts
                 and pipe culverts causing local damages to wing walls, aprons and part of the adjoining
                 embankment.
                At certain stretches of hill section of the road, side drains are found to be filled up with
                 debris from rock fall and slides.
                Damages and blockages of the road have been observed due to rock fall and slides
                 caused by the heavy rain. The consequences of such damages have further caused
                 damages to the road pavement.
                Where the road is in higher grade more than 7%, the surface run-off due to extensive
                 rain has eroded the shoulder and edge of the pavement extending the damage to the
                 base course and sub-base.
                Poor construction along with lack of compatibility of design with the terrain and soil
                 requirement has also contributed to the damages.
                Poor maintenance has also contributed to the damage of the roads. It is a fact, the
                 unexpected flood of Level-3 tropical storm is not a common phenomenon that occurred
                 in past and as such the existing roads even well-designed could not withstand such
                 widespread flooding resulting in damages to the roads.



1.2.2    Description of the proposed works

        The major works included under this Contracts are essentially intended for rehabilitation of the
        damages caused due to the flood of October, 2008 and consists of strengthening and
        rehabilitating the pavement; necessary improvements to cross-drainage structures, erosion
        protection works; and installation of required road furniture. The items of works are:

        i.        The Contractor and his employees shall adhere to the mitigation measures set down and take
                  all other measures required by the Engineer to prevent harm, and to minimize the impact of his
                  operations on the environment.

       ii.        The Contractor shall not be permitted to unnecessarily strip clear the right of way. The
                  Contractor shall only clear the minimum width for construction and diversion roads should not
                  be constructed alongside the existing road.

       iii.       Remedial actions which cannot be effectively carried out during construction should be carried
                  out on completion of each Section of the road (earthworks, pavement and drainage) and before
                  issuance of the Taking Over Certificate:

              (a) These sections should be landscaped and any necessary remedial works should be
                  undertaken without delay, including grassing and reforestation;

              (b) Water courses should be cleared of debris and drains and culverts checked for clear flow
                  paths; and

              (c) Borrow pits should be dressed as fish ponds, or drained and made safe, as agreed with the
                  land owner.

       iv.        The Contractor shall limit construction works to between 6 am and 7 pm if it is to be carried out

                  areas such as near a hospital.

       vi.        To prevent dust pollution during dry periods, the Contractor shall carry out regular watering of
                  earth and gravel haul roads and shall cover material haulage trucks with tarpaulins to prevent
                  spillage.

    1.6.2             Transport
        i.        The Contractor shall use selected routes to the project site, as agreed with the Engineer, and
                  appropriately sized vehicles suitable to the class of road, and shall restrict loads to prevent
                  damage to roads and bridges used for transportation purposes. The Contractor shall be held
                  responsible for any damage caused to the roads and bridges due to the transportation of
                  excessive loads, and shall be required to repair such damage to the approval of the Engineer.

       ii.        The Contractor shall not use any vehicles, either on or off road with grossly excessive, exhaust
                  or noise emissions. In any built up areas, noise mufflers shall be installed and maintained in
                  good condition on all motorized equipment under the control of the Contractor.

       iii.       Adequate traffic control measures shall be maintained by the Contractor throughout the

              provide appropriate training as necessary.

       ii.    The Contractor shall install and maintain a temporary septic tank system for any residential
              labor camp and without causing pollution of nearby watercourses.

       iii.   The Contractor shall establish a method and system for storing and disposing of all solid
              wastes generated by the labor camp and/or base camp.

       iv.    The Contractor shall not allow the use of fuel wood for cooking or heating in any labor camp or
              base camp and provide alternate facilities using other fuels.

       v.     The Contractor shall ensure that site offices, depots, asphalt plants and workshops are located
              in appropriate areas as approved by the Engineer and not within 500 meters of existing
              residential settlements and not within 1,000 meters for asphalt plants.

       vi.    The Contractor shall ensure that site offices, depots and particularly storage areas for diesel
              fuel and bitumen and asphalt plants are not located within 500 meters of watercourses, and are
              operated so that no pollutants enter watercourses, either overland or through groundwater
              seepage, especially during periods of rain. This will require lubricants to be recycled and a
              ditch to be constructed around the area with an approved settling pond/oil trap at the outlet.

      vii.    The contractor shall not use fuel wood as a means of heating during the processing or
              preparation of any materials forming part of the Works.

    1.6.4          Quarries and Borrow Pits
        i.    Operation of a new borrows area, on land, in a river, or in an existing area, shall be subject to
              prior approval of the Engineer, and the operation shall cease if so instructed by the Engineer.
              Borrow pits shall be prohibited where they might interfere with the natural or designed drainage
              patterns. River locations shall be prohibited if they might undermine or damage the river
              banks, or carry too much fine material downstream.

       ii.    The Contractor shall ensure that all borrow pits used are left in a trim and tidy condition with
              stable side slopes, and are drained ensuring that no stagnant water bodies are created which
              could breed mosquitoes.

       iii.   Rock or gravel taken from a river shall be far enough removed to limit the depth of material
              removed to one-tenth of the width of the river at any one location, and not to disrupt the river
              flow, or damage or undermine the river banks.

       iv.    The location of crushing plants shall be subject to the approval of the Engineer, and not be
              close to environmentally sensitive areas or to existing residential settlements, and shall be
              operated with approved fitted dust control devices.

    1.6.5          Earthworks
        i.    Earthworks shall be properly controlled, especially during the rainy season.

       ii.    The Contractor shall maintain stable cut and fill slopes at all times and cause the least possible
              disturbance to areas outside the prescribed limits of the work.

       iii.       The Contractor shall complete cut and fill operations to final cross-sections at any one location
                  as soon as possible and preferably in one continuous operation to avoid partially completed
                  earthworks, especially during the rainy season.

       iv.        In order to protect any cut or fill slopes from erosion, in accordance with the drawings, cut off
                  drains and toe-drains shall be provided at the top and bottom of slopes and be planted with
                  grass or other plant cover. Cut off drains should be provided above high cuts to minimize water
                  runoff and slope erosion.

       v.         Any excavated cut or unsuitable material shall be disposed of in designated tipping areas as
                  agreed to by the Engineer.

       vi.        Tips should not be located where they can cause future slides, interfere with agricultural land or
                  any other properties, or cause soil from the dump to be washed into any watercourse. Drains
                  may need to be dug within and around the tips, as directed by the Engineer.

    1.6.6             Historical and Archaeological Sites
        i.        If the Contractor discovers archeological sites, historical sites, remains and objects, including
                  graveyards and/or individual graves during excavation or construction, the Contractor shall:

              (a) Stop the construction activities in the area of the chance find.
              (b) Delineate the discovered site or area.
              (c) Secure the site to prevent any damage or loss of removable objects. In cases of removable
                  antiquities or sensitive remains, a night guard shall be present until the responsible local
                  authorities and the Ministry of Culture take over.
              (d) Notify the supervisory Engineer who in turn will notify the responsible local authorities and the
