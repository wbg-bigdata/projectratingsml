MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF TIE PRESIDENT
OF TIHE lNTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO
THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF BANGLADESH
FOR AN INTEGRATED NUTRITION PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the People's Republic of Bangladesh for SDR 40.1 million, the equivalent of
US$59.8 million, on standard IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years, to help finance an Integrated
Nutrition Project.
2.    Country/Sector Background. Bangladesh has some of the severest malnutrition problems in the
world: 68 % of children under five years of age are moderately or severely underweight', reflecting basic
protein-calorie malnutrition; 64% of them are severely or moderately stunted2, and 17% of them suffer
from wasting'. Moreover, 35 % - 50% of babies are born with less than the minimum acceptable weight
of 2.5 kg, and about 70% of women and children suffer from nutritional anemia. The prevalence of
night blindness due to Vitamin A deficiency is 1.7% and total goiter prevalence, 47%. All the three
known groups of causes of malnutrition contribute: a) inadequate household food security, b) weak health
services and poor environmental sanitation, and c) inappropriate "caring" practices, i.e., eating, feeding,
personal hygiene and health care behaviors. Because malnutrition affects not only productivity but
learning capability and health status, efforts to improve nutrition are vital to the overall economic and
social development of Bangladesh.
3.    The principal problems in dealing with malnutrition in Bangladesh include both poverty itself and
the lack of a clear strategy and a well-orchestrated program. Improved agricultural performance has
increased food availability, but lack of purchasing power for the poor continues to impede food security.
Government action against malnutrition has been limited, with no comprehensive effort to control the
problem nationally. The Bangladesh National Nutrition Council, set up by the Government in 1975 to
coordinate nutrition policies, has produced little impact. The efforts of the various relevant sectors and
the Non-Government Organizations (NGO) have not been brought together. The Ministry of Health and
Family Welfare (MOHFW) has the main responsibility for nutrition, but its activities have been limited.
It has undertaken some efforts such as Vitamin A distribution, iodine injections for people living where
goiter is endemic, and iron supplementation to pregnant mothers. MOHFW has also established an
Institute of Public Health Nutrition which provides training and conducts research. Some activities
contributing to nutrition are carried out in other sectors: iodation of salt, homestead gardening, and food
distribution targeted to the poor. But most of these programs need to be strengthened and focused better
on nutrition. Programs that integrate measures to deal with basic protein-calorie malnutrition and specific
disorders like iodine deficiency need to be developed. Some NGOs are active in the sector, though their
projects are confined to certain geographical areas. The Food and Agriculture Organization and the
World Food Programs have been focusing on enhancing food security; United Nations Children's Fund
(UNICEF) and to a lesser extent the World Health Organization have been the only other international
agencies which have supported nutrition programs.
1      Children whose weight-for-age is less than the reference median by 2 or more standard deviations.
2      Children whose height-for-age is less than the reference median by 2 or more standard deviations.
3      Children with weight-for-height less than the reference median by 2 or more standard deviations.

4.     Against this backdrop, an extended dialogue between the Bank and the Government, with the
active participation of UNICEF, has generated considerable interest at the highest levels of the
Government in addressing nutrition. The commitment in the MOHFW and in the Prime Minister's Office
has been particularly keen, and other ministries have demonstrated substantial interest in an inter-sectoral
effort. The Government's determination to deal with malnutrition is evidenced by several recent actions,
including the request for IDA's assistance for a Nutrition Project. The Government has agreed to include
the proposed project in its development plans, as it conforms with the sectoral investment priorities
outlined in the Fourth Five Year Plan.
5.    Project Objectives. This six-year project will initiate the development of a national nutrition
program in Bangladesh, to improve the nutritional status of the population so that malnutrition would
eventually cease to be a public health problem. To promote the development of the national nutrition
program, the project has three intermediate objectives: (i) national capacity building; (ii) community
empowerment for nutrition action; and (iii) achievement of measurable nutritional impact in those areas
exposed to all project components. The project has been designed with a major role for NGOs.
6.     Project Description. The six-year project would have three components:
a)     National Level Nutrition Activities (32% of base costs).
This component comprises four sub-components:
i.     Program Development and Institution Building to develop an effective national nutrition
program, particularly involving the role of NGOs; to develop local expertise in nutrition;
to promote policy research and operational research in nutrition; to strengthen the
capacity of Bangladesh National Nutrition Council to provide technical support in
addressing policy issues and strategy formulation; and to streamline the role of various
national level institutions in nutrition;
ii.    An IEC sub-component to develop appropriate nutrition IEC messages based on sound
research, to produce IEC materials for use in activities through interpersonal methods (as
part of the Community-Based Nutrition Component) and the media using the private
sector;
iii.    Strenethening existing nutrition activities to fill major gaps in national coverage, to
improve the efficiency of iron supplementation programs, and to promote more effective
breast-feeding practices; and
iv.    Project Management. Monitoring and Evaluation to set up an effective monitoring system
and evaluation process based on well-defined indicators and targets appropriate to the
needs of both project staff and policy/decision-makers. This component would provide
for a mid-term evaluation at the end of three years, the results of which would determine
the nature and extent of project expansion. This component will also finance the
incremental costs of a new Project Office under MOHEW.



3
b)     Community Based Nutrition Component (56% of base costs).
This is the core component of the project. It will be carried out in some thanas by NGOs and
in others by local administrations, working with NGOs and women's groups. The component
provides nutrition interventions centered around growth monitoring and promotion4, with
carefully targeted and supervised supplementary feeding at a location provided by the
communities themselves. It also provides an effective Information, Education and Communication
(IEC) effort aimed at encouraging "caring" behaviors that promote nutrition and at mobilizing
communities (particularly women) to deal with their nutritional and health needs.  This
component would adopt two targeting strategies: (i) a general targeting strategy, which includes:
all children under two years of age and women for nutritional screening; and a special focus on
those children and women who meet nutritional criteria for supplementary feeding and special
IEC; (ii) an experimental targeting strategy to be tested as a pilot in one thana: focusing on newly
wed couples and their first child until the child becomes two years old. The component would
benefit women and the poor most, because the incidence of severe nutritional problems is highest
among these groups. It would be introduced in a phased manner, starting in six thanas in the first
year. After the first two years, following a review of experience, 17 more thanas would be
added in each of the third and the fourth years. The rationale for such a gradual and phased
approach is to learn operational lessons from the first two years of project implementation as this
is the first time that the Government is going to implement a large community-based nutrition
program.
c)    Inter-sectoral Nutrition Program Development (12% of base costs).
This component would help finance activities outside the health sector and beyond the scope of
Community-Based Nutrition Component (CBNC) that have the potential to improve nutrition.
The emphasis will be on reorienting existing activities to have more nutritional impact and on
developing and testing innovative approaches particularly to reach the poor and specifically
including women. An Inter-Sectoral Nutrition Fund (ISNF) will be established. Various line
ministries and NGOs will be able to draw on ISNF for carrying out activities under sub-projects
meeting agreed criteria, after being cleared by an Inter-Sectoral Nutrition Cell under MOHFW.
All sub-project proposals to be financed from ISNF will be subject to prior review by IDA.
Examples of possible activities under this component are: improving consumption and nutrition
effects of selected targeted food programs; enhancing consumption/nutrition impact of agricultural
policies and programs; coordinating home gardening and livestock farming with CBNC; IEC
directed at the proper use of sanitary facilities and safe water; and emphasizing nutrition
education in the school curricula.
7.     Costs andfinancing. The project's estimated cost is US$67.3 million equivalent, with a foreign
exchange component of US$2.9 million. The Government will finance the equivalent of US$7.5 million
and IDA, the equivalent of US$ 59.8 million. A breakdown of the project costs and financing plan is
4    Growth Monitoring and Promotion has evolved into one of the standard approaches in malnutrition
control. This approach involves regular weighing of children, charting the weights against the
child's age in a standard 'growth chart' to monitor his/her weight gains against established norms
and taking appropriate action if the growth falters. The action would primarily be nutrition
counseling of the mother (or alternative care-taker as the case may be); it could include supervised
supplementary feeding and/or referral to a health care facility.

given in Schedule A. Procurement methods, disbursement categories and projections are in Schedule B.
Retroactive financing up to US$500,000 is proposed to cover start-up costs incurred between March 1,
1995 and Credit-signing. The start-up activities include: putting in place the team responsible for project
implementation, baseline surveys, preparation of training materials and the audience research necessary
for IEC message development. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank
Group Operations in Bangladesh are in Schedules C and D, respectively. The Staff Appraisal Report,
No. 13193-BD, is being distributed separately.
8.    Project Implementation.   MOHFW  will be responsible for the overall implementation and
management of the project, through a Project Office; it will be strengthened through the project to carry
out its new functions. The sectoral activities under the inter-sectoral component would be carried out by
the respective line ministries. The coordination of inter-sectoral activities will be the responsibility of
the Inter-Sectoral Nutrition Cell within MOHFW. NGOs will implement the community nutrition
component in some thanas, and be closely involved in other thanas, as well as providing assistance on
key aspects of other components. UNICEF would provide technical support at all stages of project
implementation. To ensure adequate project readiness, the Project Office has already been created, key
staff recruited, and accommodation and other facilities arranged. Baseline surveys, preparation of
training materials and audience research for IEC are under way.
9.     Project Sustainability.   The project design has the necessary ingredients for sustainability:
maintaining strong political will and commitment through continued advocacy; translating it into action
by the formulation of a clear national nutrition program and strategy; developing local technical,
managerial and operational capacity; and enabling people to recognize and address their own nutrition
problems, thus promoting a sense of ownership. The central concept of the project is not to create a
dependence on services but to change people's behaviors so that the impact on their nutritional status
would be lasting. Most of the incremental recurrent costs of the project are those of supplementary food
and compensation for the proposed community nutrition promoters. According to established IDA policy,
incremental recurrent costs of the project will be financed on a declining scale basis. These costs, though
recurrent within the project's life, are not expected to continue indefinitely; CBNC is designed to be a
time-bound effort, with such intensive action being needed for say 10-15 years. The issue of future
financing of CBNC activities -- both their continuation in the 40 project thanas and their nationwide
expansion -- will be addressed at the mid-term review, depending on project experience which would
determine the shape of the national nutrition program. Successful CBNC interventions should lead to
significant reductions in the burden of malnutrition, making it progressively cheaper and easier to control
using local resources, as shown by experience elsewhere.
10.   Prior experience within Bangladesh. Several NGOs in Bangladesh have undertaken various
forms of community level nutrition activities, particularly involving women. One of these, which has
been in operation for more than two years in one Thana (Muktagacha), is being carried out by the
Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee (BRAC). Fashioned after the Bank-financed Tamil Nadu
Integrated Nutrition Project, BRAC's Community Based Pilot Nutrition Initiative has covered an
estimated population of 156,000 including 5,000 under-two children, 20,000 women of child-bearing age
and 5,000 adolescent girls. The main strategy of this pilot initiative involves monthly weighing of
children under two and measurement of mid-arm circumference of women to screen them for possible
supervised supplementary feeding. Initial evaluation of BRAC's project has shown not only the feasibility
of such a community-based approach, but also the nutritional improvements which could be achieved;
most importantly, it has shown that caring practices at the household level have been improved through
the project interventions.

11. Lessons from Previous Bank/lIDA Involvement. Although this would be the first IDA-financed
nutrition project in Bangladesh, IDA's experience in several other countries, e.g., India (Tamil Nadu),
Indonesia, Guinea-Bissau and Colombia, described in their Project Completion Reports and OED
evaluations, have yielded valuable lessons for the design of the Bangladesh project. The most important
lessons are: the feasibility of reaching women and the poor more generally through community-based
interventions like growth monitoring, targeted food supplementation and nutrition IEC, the need for a
strong political cormnnitment and the involvement of the Government in project preparation, the essential
qualities of the field workers/volunteers, especially women, their minimum required strength and the
necessity for their good training and very close supervision for the labor-intensive tasks of CBNC to be
carried out effectively. Based on these lessons, the project proposes to lay the greatest emphasis on
CBNC, suggests careful targeting of beneficiaries, provides for adequate numbers of female Community
Nutrition Promoters' and two female supervisors for every 20 Community Nutrition Promoters, prefers
field-based training of volunteers to an institution-based approach, includes a strong IEC component,
stresses monitoring and evaluation, includes a mid-term review so as to apply mid-course corrections to
operational strategies and contemplates a specific inter-sectoral component with the innovative idea of
setting up an Inter-Sectoral Nutrition Fund (ISNF).
12.   Rationale for IDA Involvement. The project is fully consistent with the Country Assistance
Strategy. It reflects the priority emphasis on human resource development and on the needs of the very
poor in particular, as outlined in the Country Assistance Strategy, discussed by the Executive Directors
on February 17, 1994. Enhancements in educability and productivity of the Bangladeshi population
through better nutrition are an essential part of human resource development. Improving nutritional status
of women and children is a critical objective of national development, needed to achieve the full potential
of other substantial investments in health and family planning services, basic education, and women's
opportunities. There is no other source of significant external financing currently available to Bangladesh
for community-based nutrition programs of the type envisaged under this project. Without IDA support
to this project, malnutrition is likely to remain unaddressed in the foreseeable future. Through its proven
ability to engage the Government in a policy dialogue, IDA is in a unique position to assist it in
formulating and implementing a comprehensive nutrition strategy and program. IDA's experience with
nutrition projects worldwide and its familiarity with the issues of malnutrition specific to Bangladesh (a
sector study in 1985 and subsequent project identification activities) enable IDA to provide the necessary
leadership for concerted action against malnutrition.  IDA's past and current involvement in the
population and health sub-sectors in Bangladesh have shown the need for a comprehensive nutrition
program for a more complete investment in the human resources sectors. The project would be
coordinated with relevant activities of the ongoing Fourth Population and Health Project.
13.   Agreed Actions. During negotiations, agreements were reached with the Government on the
following actions: (i) not later than September 30, 1995, the Government will furnish a revised
implementation and monitoring plan reflecting details and modifications as agreed during the negotiations
to IDA for its concurrence (a draft implementation volume including broad implementation and
monitoring plans has already been prepared and was discussed at the negotiations) and thereafter, carry
out the said plan in a timely manner; (ii) the Project Office will be maintained and operated with adequate
staff, funding and other facilities; (iii) by September 30, 1995, a Management and Technical Support
5   In 3 thanas, one Community Nutrition Promoter will cover 1,000 population while in 3 other thanas
one Community Nutrition Promoter will cover 1,500 population. The more cost-effective ratio will be
determined by a review at the end of two years.



6
Team will be set up with the necessary expertise; (iv) by December 31, 1996, a review of the major
national level institutions active in nutrition or related fields will be carried out, the recommendations and
findings of such review furnished to IDA and recommendations implemented taking account of IDA's
comments; (v) by June 30, 1998, a mid-term evaluation of the project will be conducted by independent
professional experts, as per terms of reference acceptable to IDA; (vi) to implement CBNC, the
Government will enter into an agreement with one or more organizations acceptable to IDA and in
accordance with terms of reference acceptable to IDA; (vii) by June 30, 1996, and by December 31,
1996, the Government will have selected thanas meeting criteria agreed with IDA, for introducing CBNC
in the third and fourth years respectively; (viii) before CBNC activities are begun in a thana, a baseline
survey of nutritional status will be carried out according to terms of reference and methodology
acceptable to IDA; (ix) the Inter-Sectoral Nutrition Fund (ISNF) will be established promptly after credit-
signing and operated in a manner satisfactory to IDA; (x) the Inter-Sectoral Nutrition Cell will be
maintained and operated with the authority to clear sub-projects found suitable as per agreed criteria, to
be financed from ISNF, all such sub-project proposals being subject to prior review and approval by IDA;
and (xi) the Government will furnish to IDA audit reports of project accounts by independent auditors
acceptable to IDA within nine months of the close of each fiscal year.
14.   Poverty Category. Program of Targeted Interventions: This Project would reduce poverty by
decreasing malnutrition, thereby improving educability and productivity. The project focuses on the
undernourished, particularly poor women and children. The selection of the target groups of beneficiaries
is based on nutritional rather than income criteria, but the majority of the poorest women and children
suffer from severe nutritional deficiencies and would therefore be the main beneficiaries.
15.   Environmental Aspects. No detrimental environmental impacts are expected. The inter-sectoral
component of the project is likely to benefit the environment by promoting the use of sanitary latrines
and safe water supply and by improving sanitation practices.
16.   Program Objective Categories. As the project seeks to improve the nutritional status particularly
of women and children, it would contribute to the following project objective categories of the Bank:
Poverty Alleviation, Women in Development, and Human Resource Development, through enhanced
educability, improved employment opportunities, increased productivity and better health status.
17.   Project Benefits. The project would build the Government capacity to formulate and implement
a comprehensive national nutrition program. It would lead to better nutrition particularly among women
and children under 2 years of age, improved learning capacity, and increased productivity. Through its
special focus on women, the project would also enhance women's status in the society. The project will
contribute indirectly to increased practice of family planning by promoting children's survival prospects.
Finally, it will- foster community organization in rural Bangladesh. Though the project would mainly
affect the population groups being targeted by CBNC, basic changes in household behaviors related to
health and nutrition would benefit the entire population of the CBNC thanas in the long run; the national
level nutrition activities would benefit all of Bangladesh, and eventually the benefits of CBNC would also
be extended nationwide. By improving general health, the project will also reduce the burden of disease,
thereby resulting in cost savings for the health care system. This being a social sector project, it is not
possible to calculate precise financial and economic rates of return, but cost-effectiveness has been
considered carefully. Since there will be direct and indirect beneficiaries, it is difficult to estimate the
total number of beneficiaries of the project. But over 3 million women and under-two children in the 40
thanas are estimated to be screened by CBNC, leading to a unit cost of US$10 per beneficiary over 6
years; the costs of the national level activities and inter-sectoral nutrition development have not been



7
included in this calculation, as their benefits would be spread over the whole country. The project is
likely to yield useful lessons on community-based efforts of the kind being envisaged, not only for the
planned nutrition program in Bangladesh, but also for other similar programs elsewhere and for other
intersectoral development efforts.
18.    Risks. The project faces three principal risks. (i) The country now has limited capacity to
implement nutrition activities. The project seeks to reduce this risk in several ways. It would phase the
introduction of the main nutritional intervention very gradually, while working to expand implementation
capability. It would also support a strong Project Office to promote effective project implementation and
include a component for Program Development and Institution Building. Moreover, the project design
also includes an active involvement of NGOs in project execution. Additional technical assistance will
be provided by UNICEF and by the Institute of Nutrition, University of Mahidol, Thailand. Despite all
these measures to enhance implementation capacity, this project is the first of its kind in Bangladesh and
will require intensive supervision from IDA. (ii) Coordinating and implementing activities undertaken
through different ministries under the Inter-Sectoral Component could pose difficulties. To mitigate this
risk, the project would require the establishment of an Inter-Sectoral Nutrition Cell within MOHFW as
well as substantive inputs from the respective agencies (including NGOs) implementing inter-sectoral sub-
projects. (iii) Volunteers could be ineffective as Community Nutrition Promoters and Community
Nutrition Organizers. The project would minimize this risk by carefully formulating and pre-testing the
job descriptions of these field-level workers, providing strong training and supervision support and
instituting effective monitoring mechanisms, with the support of NGOs.
19.   Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed development credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
