PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
MADAGASCAR
FIRST AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
(Cr. 1064-MAG)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) of the First Agri-
cultural Credit Project in Madagascar, for which IDA Credit 1064-MAG for
US$11.50 million was approved on September 9, 1980. The Credit was fully
disbursed when it closed on December 31, 1986 some 2 112 years later than
originally scheduled.
The PCR was prepared by the World Bank's Resident Representative's
office in Madagascar, and is based on data provided by Bankin'ny Tantsaha
Mpamokatra (BTM), review of the Staff Appraisal Report (No. 2898-MAG) dated
July 1980, the President's Report (No. P-2788-MAG) dated August 20, 1980,
the Credit Agreement dated December 23, 1980, and relevant reports, corres-
pondence and memoranda in Bank files, as well as interviews with Bank
staff.
The draft report has been read by the Operations Evaluation
Department (OED), and copies were sent to the Borrower and its agencies for
comments in February 1989. No comments were received.

PROJECT COKPLETION REPORT
IADAGASCAR
FIRST AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PRJECT
(Credit 1064-MAG)
I. EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
The First Agricultural Credit Project was appraised in September
1979. Project cost was $14.20 million, and IDA provided a Credit equi-
valent to $11.50 million on September 9, 1980. The project was revised to
focus on institutional strengthening and the financing of key imports for
the agricultural sector. The Credit closing date was twice extended and
the Credit was finally closed in December 1986, instead of June 1984 as
originally foreseen, with cancellation of US$0.7 million.
Oblectives
The main component of its design was funding for an increase in
BTM (Agricultural Development Bank) lending to small farmers, largely for
export crops but alsc for industrial and food crops. Other components
provided consultancy, training and equipment to build up BTM as an insti-
tution.
IMplementation Experience
The Credit became effective in August 1981. Project implemen-
tation coincided with a catastrophic period for the Malagasy economy which
had repercussions in every sector.   Agriculture suffered from a battery of
controls at the same time as investment, input supply and producer services
collapsed. As a result, supply and demand for credit--which formed the
basis of the project--dwindled sharply. The credit was amended three times
to allow the use of Credit funds for import of vital inputs, in order to
unblock the input supply constraint, but this had little impact on lending
levels.
The banking sector also suffered a severe financial crisis of low
profitability and illiquidity resulting from unwise lending, largely to the
public sector, but also reflecting the poor performance of the economy as a
whole. The institution building components of the project were expanded to
help BTM through this difficult period.
Results
The project did not achieve its objective of financing extra
lending to small farmers (only 2% of IDA funds for the purpose were dis-
bursed). The real value of smallholder lending fell during the project
period and the number of beneficiaries did not grow. However, the project



-vi -
did sustain the smallholder program through a period in which it might
otherwise have collapsed and helped BTM to test alternative approaches.
The institution building components contributed to BTM's financial and
institutional rehabilitation and pointed the way to financial sector
reform, as well as leading lito the Second Agricultural Credit Project,
with a credit of US$10.0 million signed on July 31, 1987. The import
financing (which absorbed most of the original credit funds), paved the way
for the Agricultural Sector Adjustment Credit in 1986.
Sustainability
The sustainability of the institutional developments will clearly
depend on future government support for credit operations, together with
the future course of the country and economy after a period of severe
decline. The bulk of project expenditures, however, went eventually for
critical imports to meet immediate needs, where the sustainability concept
is of little application.
Fndingst
At the project level, the main lesson is that the formula for
providing financial services to small farmers has not yet been found in
Madagascar. The project pointed up some conditions that will be required
for success: a conducive policy context, availability of other services,
and the need to base interventions on a complete financial circuit, includ-
ing savings, not just lending.



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT.
MADAGASCAR
FIRST AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
(Cr. 1064-HAG)
I. INTRODUCTION
A. The Project As Appraised
1.01     The First Agricultural Credit Project was appraised in September
1979. The main component of its design was funding for an increase in BTM
(Agricultural Development Bank) lending to small farmers, largely for
export crops but also for industrial and food crops. Other components
provided consultancy, training and equipment to build up BTM as an
institution. Project cost was $14.20 million, and IDA provided a Credit
equivalent to $11.50 million. In practice the main thrust of the project
turned out to be institutional strengthening and the financing of key
imports for the agricultural sector.
B. Implementation and Revision
1.02     The Credit beeame effective in August 1981.  The project period
coincided with a catastrophic period for the Malagasy economy which had
repercussions in every sector of the economy. Agriculture suffered from a
battery of controls at the same time as investment, input supply and
producer services collapsed. As a result, supply and demand for credit--
which formed the basis of the project--dwindled. The credit was thrice
amended to allow the use of Credit funds for import of inputs, in order to
unblock the constraint to input supply, but this had little impact on
lending levels.
1.03     The banking sector also suffered a severe financial crisis of low
profitability and illiquidity resulting from unwise lending, largely to the
public sector, but also reflecting the poor performance of the economy as a
whole. The institution building components were greatly expanded to help
BTM through this difficult period.
1.04     The Credit closing date was tw,:e extended and the Credit was
finall- closed in December 1986, instead of June 1984, as originally
foreseen.
C. Obiectives. Results and Lessons
1.05     The project did not achieve its objective of financing extra
lending to small farmers.  rhe real value of smallholder lending fell
during the project period and the number of beneficiaries did not grow.
However, the project did sustain the smallholder program through a period
in which it might otherwise have collapsed and helped BTM to test
alternative approaches. The institution building components contributed to
BTM's financial and institutional rehabilitation and pointed the way to
financial sector reform.
1.06     At the project level, the main lesson is that the formula for
providing financia'l services to small farmers has not yet been found in

for success: a conducive policy context, availability of other services,
and the need to base interventions on a complete financial circuit,
including savings, not just lending.
1.07     A second project, effective in November 1987, is largely a DFC-
type credit for agricultural SMEs. However it provides funds for
continuing tests of formulae for rural financial services, and funds for a
study. These modest actions may lead to a more 3uccessful d-itign for the
future. In the meantime, the report concludes, BTM is providing its most
effective aid to agricultural production through its extensive financing of
marketing of agricultural produce.
II. AGRICULTURE AND RURAL FINANCE
A. Importance of Ari'culture and Subsector Description
2.01     Agriculture is Madagascar's dominant economic sector; it employs
85% of the population and accounts for more than 802 of export earnings.
Production and farming systems vary widely, with many commodities produced,
but production in value terms is dominated by paddy (302) and beef (162).
A small group of export crops, (coffee, cloves, and vanilla) accounts for
about 15% of production but some three-quaxters of merchandise exports.
Industrial crops, notably sugar and cotton, contribute about 72 of
agricultural production value. Approximately 802 of total production comes
from smallholder activity, and small farmers (in the 1 to 2 ha. range) are
the backbone of Nadagascar's agricultural economy. Over half of
agricultural production by value is for subsistence and the share of
subsistence production has slowly increased over the past decade. In
contrast to most sub-Saharan African countries, irrigation is widely
practiced in Madagascar, with water control systems in use on about 1
million hectares, one third of cultivated land. Overwhelmingly, irrigated
land is used to produce rice, the staple of the Malagasy diet. The
country's rich and varied agricultural potential offers excellent prospects
for raising incomes, improving the supply of industrial inputs, and for
increasing foreign exchange earnings, but this potential is far from being
realized.
B. Policy and Developments 1980-87
2.02     The history of this project perfectly reflects the difficult
history of the Malagasy agricultural spctor during the period when the
project was carried out.  The Government's policy during the first part of
this period, up to 1983, was to nationalize marketing and processing
activities; to dictate internal terms of trade via monopoly marketing
circuits; to centralize input supply activities; and, contrarily, to



-3-
decentralize other producer services - extension, credit - to regional and
even local levels through links with the "fokonolonal system. 1
2.03     All this combined with severe balance of payments and fiscal
crises, again largely policy-induced, to produce stagnation in the
agriculture sector. Paddy production levelled off and imports of rice shot
up, edible oils production slumped, coffee export quantitites fell by a
third. The agriculture sector (and the economy as a whole) suffered
agonizing supply shortages, collapsing marketing circuits and incentives,
and a general reversiou to a lower, subsistence level of activity.
2.04     Hard times forced tough decisions and from 1983 the Government
began piecemeal to dismantle the dirigiste structure and to rebuild
services and incentives. The climb back is proving harder than the decline
but by 1985 signs of reviving interest and activity were ev'dent.  1987 saw
a bumper paddy crop, wider availability of inputs and a generally free
marketing and pr4c*ing system. In general, the outlook for agriculture in
1988 is better than for ten years, and Government is investing in services,
notably research and extension, to keep pace with demand.

"fokonolona", traditional Malagasy concept of a local kinship
community, was taken as the generic name for the local government
reform that resulted from the 1972-5 revolutions. This reform
replaced the colonial system of a central power hierarchy descending
to village level with an ascending hierachy of institutions
beginning at the the village level, each level of which elected the
next level, up to provincial level.  This system was intended to
bring people into responsible political participation at all levels
and to be the main engine of rural development. Its ability to
harness people's energies for rural development has in practice been
sma'll as the institutions have occupied an uneasy status. At times
they lack popular support, being seen to represent narrow
"political' interests. At other times they show a populist tendency
to placate rather than impose. The development of the system in the
late 1970s, was accompanied by a relaxation of 'colonial' fiscal and
administrative rules - poll tox was abolished, health and education
fees reduced, sanctions against bush fires were neglected. The
result has been a hybrid structure, largely ineffectual, as it has
lacked both political authority, popular support and source of
funds.



C. Banking Secte'r
The Banking Sector
2.05     In 1977 the Government reorganised the banking sector to create
just three state-owned banks, each with a sectoral specialisation (trade,
industry and agriculture). The BTM, implementing agency for the project,
is the agricultural bank. The sector thus acquired two distinctive
characteristics: the banks formed a small cartel that tended to collude on
commercial policy and to show little competitive instinct; and the banks,
as wholly-owned parastatals, were treated by Govarnment as instruments of
policy.
2.06     The result was that the banks were required to participate in
Government investment policy, sometimes overtly through share subscription,
-more usually covertly through permanent and growing oveFdraft facilities
for state enterprises. This process accelerated in the early 1980s when
the banks were required to fund the unprofitable operations of the numerous
ill-conceived public investments of the 1978-9 period. The result lay for
sometime undetected by weak audit and poor accounting standards but emerged
as a major problem by 1985. At this time, BTM had 52% of its portfolio
classed as doubtful. High interest spreads, required to build up bad debt
provisions, passed the cost on to the customer.
2.07     By 1985, banking sector reform had became an issue.  International
standard audits and provisions policies were introduced. Government and
the banks set up processes to reform or liquidate dud parastatal
enterprises. Separate boards for each bank were set up and interest rates
freed to encourage competition.
The BTM
2.08     BTM results from the fusion of two institutions and traditions.
It inherited in 1977 the branch network and staff of a regular commercial
bank; this was merged with a small, centralized rural development bank.
This has given BTM a unique and highly advantageous heritage, at once a
bank obliged to respect efficiency and profits in commercial banking and an
institution with experience in, and a vocation for, term lending in rural
areas.
2.09     However, BTM has never resolved the inherent conflict between
these roles, nor properly exploited the advantages of each. As a
commercial bank it has never generated the domestic resource base to allow
it to expand lending; and in fact the profitability of term lending in
rural areas has always been questionable. In practice, the obligation to
tie up funds in de facto term loans to parastatals has undermined its
portfolio.
2.10     Nonetheless, the BTM has retained a professionalism and a spirit
that reflect its heritage and still offer the possibility of exploiting it.
Top management is largely from the development bank stream and retains a
strong interest in developing this side of the business. The commercial



- 5 -
branch network has begun to participate more fully in rural lending,
particularly to smallholders. At headquarters a new department was
established in early 1988 in an attempt to develop term lending business.
D. Rural Finance
Rural Cre'it--the Formal System
2.11     BTM's unique qualification for rural finance has been outlined
above. It has an extensive branch network in all the major agricultural
areas of the country. It has in 1988 a total of 44 branches and 22 field
offices in total (41 branches and 26 field offices at appraisal in 1979).
It is a generalized bank as well as a specialised agricultural bank, but
nonetheless retains a strong resource base and lending program in rural
areas. The 1987 accounts show:
FMG billion    % of total
lending
Lending to agricultural production       9.8               6
Lending to agricultural marketing       45.3              29
Total lending                          159.0             100
(Source: Annex 1)
2.12     Since the early 1970s, BTM (and its predecessor) has operated a
smallholder lending program. With the advent of the fokonolona system (see
note 1 to paragraph 2.02) this program has been called "Financement du
Monde Rural' or FMR. Initially FMR operated only as group credit. This
group credit uses the ufokontany', the lowest level in the fokonolona
hierarchy, to absorb some of the administration costs of lending to small
farmers, and to provide the moral support of the community in making the
lending decision and in tecovering the loans. The basic rules are as
follows:-
o the fokontany authorities and the local extension agent draw
up a list of applicants for loans;
the BTM officer, the fokontany authorities and the extension
agent go through the list and agree on a position on each
applicant;
BTM then finances the loans, the fokontany authorities help
with disbursement and collection;
in the event of the repayment rate being below 952, the
fokontany is "closed", and is not eligible for finance the
next year.



-6-
2.13     These loans are for farmers tiith under 5 ha (about 99% of Malagasy
farmers). The interest rate is the best going rate. This has gone from
10% in 1979 to 16% in 1988 (Annex 7). The fokontany receives a small
commission for its wo:.
2.14     In 1980, BTM also 'ntroduced an individual smallholder lending
program, called FMR-ODRI, designed to cater for medium term lending for
equipment, for land development etc. These loans are approved directly by
BTM and contracted with individuals.
2.15     Performance of the FMR programs has been mixed and is described in
more detail below (para 4.03 to 4.23). It has never touched more than a
small fraction of the farm population, the largest program in the last
years being that of 1986 when 25,000 farmers (2% of total farm families)
received loans. FMR lending has never exceeded 2% of BTH's total lending
or 0.5% of total bank credit in Madagascar. The FMR program has never been
linked to savings or other rural financial services.
2.16     Total credit to the agricultural sector has ranged between 32% and
39% of BTM's lending since 1980.
Rural credit - The Informal System
2.17     No data are available on the prevalence of informal credit but
various forms of rural usury are wides)read. Most common are sales of
standing crops (an illegal practice) and credit from local stores to be
reimbursed by crop deliveries at harvest. No mutual savings associations
exist in rural areas, although an attempt is being made by one NGO to
develop this.
'II. THE PROJECT
A. Identification. Preparation, Appraisal
3.01     The post-1975 revolution Government had a vision of decentralized
rural development, mobilising commitment and resources at the field level
through the fokonolona structure. Certain hitherto centralized services
were to be linked in to this system; rural credit was one, but attempts
were also made to decentralize extension, input supply and veterinary
services and to make them responsible to the fokonolona strucuture. With
this vision Government requested the Bank during the 1977 Annual Meetings
to help identify a rural credit project.
3.02     A first identification mission in March 1978 was impressed by the
BTM. The mission put its finger on several very important problems that
were just germinating--notably some poor quality lending done at
Government's behest and with Government's "guara.ntee", and the absence of
audit to any acceptable standard. But the smallholder lending program was
growing and its performance was good--113,000 loans 1971-6 with an arrears
rate of 4%; and BTH looked sound.



3.03     Subsequent prepatration missions developed a project that would
channel IDA funds through the BTM to a variety of investments including
lending to smallholders for fooderops in selected areas where extension was
operating, and for industrial and export crops; lending to agro-Lndustry;
and lending for "collective" investments.
3.04     From the beginning, the credit component program was recognized as
high risk. During preparation it was noted that the elimination of private
trade was threatening marketing services and that lack of incentives was
leading to slack credit demand. The final project brief noted the inherent
difficulty of supervising group credit and remarked on the "politicisation'
of the process via the fokontany.
3.05     By appraisal, which took place in September 1979, the dwindling
supply of inputs, the weakness of the extersion service, the diminution of
incentives through price controls, together with the inevitable dependence
of the smallholder repayment rate on variables like the weather, were all
issues. However, the Government and BTM were felt to be essentially
pragmatic. The conlusion of the appraisal mission was that the risks weru
very real for fooderops and livestock, but that export and industrial crops
were largely protected by their own pricing and services regimes. The
mission recommended a project that concentrated on lending to smallholders
for export and industrial crops and on strategic lending for foodcrops.
The idea of lending to agroindustry and collective investments was dropped
except for a small experimental credit component.
3.06     The decision meeting endorsed the appraisal mission's judgement
and agreed on some safeguards. A general dialogue on agricultural pricing
policy was required (a covenant was to provide for this). The problem of
risk arising from weather was to be handled by the establishment of a crop
insurance fund. However, insufficient consideration was given to the
difficulties of implementing this concept in practice.2
3.07     Negotiations focussed on a traditional Bank issue, the interest
rate, which at 7X - 102 was about zero or marginally negative in real
terms. It was agreed to raise the schedule, with a top rate of 122.
2/
In May 1980 the Minister of Finance prompted the Government to set
up a crop insurance fund using the export crop stabilization funds
as financial backing. This decision has never been implemented,
although the insurance companies introduced a funded scheme in 1987
on a small scale. In view of the nature of farming in Madagascar--
small, largely subsistence agriculture--the costs and risks of this
kind of operation are enormous. The economic climate prevailing
during project implementation would have made these risks almost
impossible to evaluate.



B. Proiect Description and Costs
3.08     The project as presented to the Board was intended to be
implemented over three years and comprised:
(a) Seasonal credit, for the maintenance of existing plantations
of coffee, cloves, and vanilla, along the northeastern and
western coasts; for the maintenance of sugar cane
plantations, mainly in Mahanjaga faritany; and for the
cultivation of foodcrops (paddy, maize, and groundnuts)
mainly on the central plateau;
(b) Medium-term credit for the regeveration of old coffee
plantations, the establishment of new sugar plantations, and
the purchase of draft animals;
(c) Long-term credit for the establishment of new plantations of
coffee, vanilla, pepper and cocoa;
(d) Experimental credit (short, medium and long-term) to
smallholders or village-level cooperatives for various
agricultural activities, e.g., vineyards establishment, steer
stall-fattening, and small-scale pig fattening;
(e) Staff training for BTM in financial, managerial, and computer
disciplines;
(f) Logistical support to BTM, notably vehicles for a pilot
program of mobile banks; and
(g) Consultant services to prepare a feasibility study to
introduce a Data Base Management system in BTM.
3.09     Projects costs were estimated at $14.20 million, of which $12.90
million (91%) for loans to smallholders, $630,000 (4%) for the experimental
credit to smallholders, and the balance of $670,000 (5%) for consultants,
training and the mobile banks. Financing was to be provided by IDA ($11.50
million, 81%) and BTM ($2.70 million, 19%). These resourees were to be
provided to BTM as equity and reflows from smallholder repayments would be
earmarked for relending to smallholders.

v. Benefits and Risks
3.10     The main beneficiaries of the project were to be 25,000 families
producing export crops whose incomes would more than double. 1200 families
producing sugar cane and 6000 families producing fooderops would also
benefit. The rate of return from these investments was calculated at 60%.
The main risks discussed in the appraisal report were, first, the provision
of extension and input supply services. This risk was considered beyond
project specific resolution but extension for export and industrial crops
was adequate, and the BTM's lending to foodcrops was conditional on the
adequacy of extension. Second, the marketing and pricing structure was a
constraint; as already mentioned, this was to be the subject of a
covenanted dialogue. Finally, BTM's performance and its relations with the
fokonolona would require monitoring; the institution was, however,
financially sound and well managed.
IV. IMPLEMENTATION
A.  Board Approval, Effectiveness, Extensions,
Completion, Closure
4.01     The Board approved an IDA credit of SDR 8.7 mlllion on September
9, 1980. The Credit became effective on August 17, 1981. During the
period of the Credit three amendments were signed which: (1) reallocated
the lion's share of credit funds to finance imports of inputs and tractors,
the counterpart passing to the BTM for its original purpose of funding
agricultural lending; (2) greatly enlarged the institution building
component, mainly for consultancy and computer equipment; and (3) extended
the closing date progressively from June 30, 1984 to December 31, 1986.
The last disbursement was made in July 1987.  Disbursements totalled SDR
8.27 million, 95% of the total. SDR 426,000 were cancelled.
B. Actual Implementation v. Proiect Design

C.  Credit Component
4.03     This component was to receive 912 of IDA Credit funds and
represented the heart of the project.
4.04     In practice the appraisal mission's identification of the risks
regarding the component was rapidly proved correct. By the time of the
first supervision mission in November 1980, and even before effectiveness,
the Bank was writing to Government that "le montant des arrires paralyse
le FMR" (the level of arrears is paralyzing the FMR).  The FMR recovery
rate on the due date for the 1977/8 season was 22%. The BTM's response had
been to cut lending almost in half for the 1978/9 season, which achieved a
slightly better repayment rate of 381 by the due date-. The diagnosis was
balanced between the politicisation of the lending process and the problems
of poor harvests due to the weather.
4.05     This early experience set a pattern for the following years.  Many
fokontany remained closed due to arrears. An effort to expand lending.in
the first project year, 1981, led to a drop in the recovery rate, and BTM
rapidly--and wisely--retrenched. As a result, the real value of FMR lending
never regained the pre-project level. The program was equivalent to 12,100
t of fooderops fertilizer in 1980, but only 7,900 t in 1987, as shown in
the table below:

(Source: Annexes 4 and 6)
4.06     The lending process and the weather continued to be identified as
constraints, but they were dwarfed--and all hope of fulfilling appraisal
targets was eliminated--by the evolution of sector-wide and economy-wide
factors quite beyond the scope of the project.



- 12 -
4.07     In the agricultural s2ctor, the dwindling of incentives and the
break up of marketing circuits on the demand side, was paralleled by the
eroding capacity of research and extension and by the drying up of input
supply. Macroeconomic factors of fiscal and balance of payments crisis had
their impact on services and supply. During the period 1979-83 the
agricultural sector underwent a very lean period which touched not just the
vulnerable foodcrops and livestock sectors but also the hitherto relatively
insulated export crop sector. Fertilizer sunply dropped from its mid 1970s
peak, tractors and imported equipment were just not available; and
incentives to invest and to produce more for the market disappeared.
4.08     As early as mid-1981, when the Credit was becoming effective, the
idea was mooted that the disbursement of the IDA funds could move upstream
to finance imports of agricultural inputs which, once in the market, would
unblock at least one of the constraints on BTM's agricultural lending.
This idea was accepted by IDA and a first amendment in July 1982 permitted
BTM to import fertilizers. The program was developed cautiously at first,
with restriction to one area around Antsirabe where an extension project
offered promise of technical support. Under a second amen'dment in October
1983, the list of goods eligible widened to include tractors, equipment and
spare parts and controls on end use were dropped. Under a third amendment
in April 1985, the program became a tect for a subsequent liberalized
import regime supported under the IDA Agricultural Sector Adjustment
Credit.  By credit closing SDR 5.89 million (67X of the total Credit) had
been disbursed on these programs.
4.09     It was agreed that the counterpart of these funds (FMG 3,831
million) would flow back to the BTM for the original purpose of financing
incremental lending on the FMR. By the project closing date a total of FMG
950 million, equivalent to about $1.8 million or 202 of the original
smallholder lending component, had been financed. IDA recognized the logic
that some of the counterpart should be allocated to fund non-smallholder
lending as the Credit was being used to import tractors and ochq.r items not
likely to be bought by smallholders. BTM was allowed to use 50% of the
counterpart for this purpose (FMG 1,915 million) and this was fully
utilised by the closing date. A balance of FMG 966 million remains,
awaiting increases in smallholder lending (Annex 10).
4.10     Why, despite the reallocation of the Credit, was incremental
smallholder lending only at 2U% of appraisal targets after an
implementation period of six and half years, double the originally foreseen
commitment period of three years? The reasons are many:
the recovery rates remained poor and the ratchet effect of
BTM's practice of 'closing' fokontanys continually reduced
the eligible population.
extension, input supply, marketing services and incentives
improved only slowly from 1983, and B!M's programs M'ept the
same slow pace. The agricultural economy had turned inward
and often reverted to unmonetized subsistence. Population
growth made the resurgence of market orientation more
difficult.



- 13 -
* the inherent problems of smallholder lending--high cost, high
risk, dependence on the weather--continued and no 'royal
road" opered up to solve them.
* the important export crop lending program never materialized.
In fact, the exp- i crop sector presented no incentives
either to new investment or to maintenance of existing
investments during this period, and BTM never began to
implement the program.
* speciiic policy decisions connnected with liberalization of
the economy had an impact on credit demand and profitability.
Increases in the price of inputs occurred through the
elimination during 1984-7 of both overt and covert (exchange
rate) subsidies. Producer prices for foodcrops oscillated
from very high levels, well above import parity, in the early
days of liberalisation (1984/6) to levels moderated
indirectly by Government interventions that were below import
parity (1987). The perceived interest of borrowing to buy
inputs declined.
*  BTM's FMR program remained the lending vehicle.  Flexibility
was introduced--the rules fo: reopening fokontanys were given
liberal ir.terpretation, credit associations became eligible
under the program, the ODRI (para 2.14) was introduced--but
the paradigm of mass credit via the quasi-political fokontany
remained. Yet the weakenesses of the system were apparent to
all. To quote from supervision mission observations: 'the
guarantee of the fokontany is meaningless and unenforceable"
(March 1981); "loans are given out through the (fokontanys)
without an in-depth assessement of their capabilities to
administer the loans' (March 1982); 'an innovative approach
to lending through other organisations is necessary--the
principle problem has been the lack of an effective and
workable mechanism to onlend to a large number of small
farmers" (November 1982).
4.11     To BTM's credit, it recognized the need to search for new
approaches, and under the guise of the original "Experimental Credit"
component, it began to search for them (see below, para 4.13).
4.12     Ironically, in a com?onent beset by problems throughout
implementation, the interest rate issue which was debated at negotiations
and which has bedevilled so many other credit projects, was never a
problem. Supply and management prob'ems upstream of credit delivery meant
that the allocative inefficiency and moral hazard presented by
preferential, sometimes negative real, interest rates never became an issue
during implementation.

D. Experimental Credit
4.13     The experimental credit component as originally designed (para
3.08) was never implemented; problems with the FMR and the difficult
conditions in the agriculture sector prevented BTM from taking _he risks
involved. However, from 1985, BTM implemented a "pilot credit management
project' using funds from the experimental credit category. This pilot
project was intended to explore ways of improving the performance of the
smallholder credit program.
4.i4     When the outlook in the sector began to improve somewhat from 1983
(para 2.04), the cry went up for agricultural credit, seen as a necessary
accompaniment to intensification, particularly for input and equipment
purchase, in a decapitalized sector. BTM then faced a classic conundrum--
how to provide agricultural credit with a system that had been discredited
through poor performance, and how to build smallholder.lending in
comimunities with a history of arrears.
4.15     The solution adopted, with IDA encouragement and technical input,
was to try to revive the FMR by intensifying the BTM management input; and
by introducing flexibility, for example, in allowing credit associations to
qualify in addition to fokontanys, and in allowing fokontanys to requalify
If arrears were concentrated on a few individuals (the individuals were
excluded). It was hoped that this would reduce arrears, increase lending
and develop a viable (ie self-sustaining) mass credit model.
4.16     As this approach was costly and experimental, it was limited to
six BTM branches3 of which four in areas of revived agricultural services
and two in areas which did not so benefit (these two acting as a control).
The approach was based ont
-    increase in field staff, and in staff mobility;
-    regular visits to borrowing communities (5 times during the
loan cycle); and
-    simplification of procedures.
4.17     The 'pilot project" started in 1986.  The objectives set for this
test were to try to establish a financially sound basis for smallholder
lending through:
-    increase in the recovery rate to 75% in 1986, to 85% in 1987
and to 951 in 1988;
-    increase in lending; and
-    promotion of other financial services, notably savings.

(Lac Alaotra), MH'hitsy, Arivonimamo (encadrement diffus).



- 15 -
4.18     The project initially had considerable success.  In the pilot
branches recovery levels went up to 811 in 1986 and to 85Z in 1987.
Lending volumes in FMG terms went up 431 in 198617 over 198516. However,
in the second year of the pilot problems emerged. Although the overall
recovery rate was satisfactory (851), the recovery rate of that year's
seasonal credit fell; at the same time lending in 198718 was down 201 on
the 198617 performance.
4.19     The main reason for this initial success fo'.lowed by a reversion
can be found in the shift in the basic profitability of the main operation
BTM was financing, paddy production. In 1986, high paddy prices and low
input prices gave a rough Benefit: Cost Ratio of 3. In 1987, a bumper
harvest, low paddy prices and higher post-devaluation input prices gave a
rough Benefits Cost Ratio of 1.3. The effect on farmers' ability to repay
their 198617 loans and their interest in new loans for 198718 is clear.
4.20     In terms of financial soundness, only two of the six test branches
covered the cost of their operations through the interest income of about
151 on outstandings. If the default rate of 151 is added, this gives a
program cost of at least 301 of outstandings per year, before imputting any
cost of funds.
4.21     In terms of farmers served, the extra effort in these six branches
increased the number of loans made from 5300 in 1985/6 to 7500 in 1986/87.
The number of loans fell back in 1987/8 to 5200. No measurable increase in
savings activity has been reported.
4 '47&'    An analysis of this experience suggests the harsh conclusion that
a durable formula for providing financial services to Malagasy smallholders
has still to be found. The fundamental problems remain:
very low level of monetisation;
shifting profitability;
the lack of a savings instrument with low transaction costs;
and
lack of an efficient mechanism tying t e rural sector into
the banking system.
4.23     The lessons drawn ares
new relations should be tested, particularly savings and
credit associations, which could be counselled by
BTM and linked in to the formal system once they had
attained some viability;
look to the rich areas, particularly the cash crop areas; and
a continued high level of support will be essential until the
right model is developed.
Under the follow-up project BTX will be studying new initiatives
in other countries and testing those that look most appropriate.

E. Training
4.24     The objective of this component was to create a permanent capacity
to provide in-house training for managerial and financial staff, with
emphasis on accounting, financial analysis, banking practice and
management. BTM recruited a technical assistant in 1983. After initial
problems in the appointment of counterparts, the training unit was set up.
The stay of the technical assistant was extended at BE's request by one
year, to a total of three years.
4.25     An IDA evaluation (done by EAPIT) of the training component in
1986 concluded that overall the programs had been effective. Regarding the
capacity of the training unit, EAPIT concluded that there was a lack of in-
house expertise and that links between training and personnel management
needed to be reinforced, otherwise programs could not contribute to
coherent professional growth. With EAPIT guidance, and with consultant
assistance from both the French audit firm (para 5.16) and from local
consultants, BTM then set up a new personnel management structure, wrote
job descriptions, and carried out an evaluation of all staff.  These
actions fed in to a process of career development which BTM is now
managing, and created the outline of a trainirng    ds assessment, which
contributed in turn to the revision of the training activities. The EAPIT
evaluation pointed to the over-dominant role played by the technical
assistant; the technical assistant was encouraged to transfer
responsibility to his counterpa:ts, and BTM was able to suppress the post
by mid-1986.
4.26     Although the process is still evolving, indications are that both
personnel management and training are now operational and of good standard.
There are three full-time trainers. A comprehensive training program is
carried out each year, including in-house courses, often with outside
expertise; training in local professional centers; and occasional overseas
courses for senior staff.
F. Mobile Banks
4.27     The objective of this component was to test the feasibility and
profitability of using mobile banks to bring banking services to rural
areas. Of seven vehicles provided for, BTM, cautiously, purchased three in
1983. During the project period the mobile banks were tested in a number
of areas where the richness of agriculture promised a higher level of
banking activity (Lac Alaotra, Manakara, Antsirabe) and also in one region
where the distarce between branches was very great (the south west, based
at Toliara). The mobile banks have never attracted a significant volume of
general banking business and have been used mainly for disbursement and
recovery of FMR loans and for cash transfers between branches. For this
reason, the fleet of three mob!le banks proved adequate ind no further
vehicles were purchased. BTM intends (as of April 1988) to test again the
possibility of drumming up banking business by making the mobile banks
fully fledged "guichets", able to deal with a whole range of client



- 17 -
transactions on the spot. It is not clear that Malagasy farmers will place
trust in this mechanism, nor that BTM will ever generate enough business to
make mobile banks a profitable investment. They form however a useful and
necessary complement to the FMR operation and could play a large role in
new efforts to develop rural financial markets.
G. Computer Component
4.28     The "computer component' of the project comprised three months
consultant services for a feasibility study tc establish a data base
management system, and a training program on the BTM's newly acquired
computer. Between appraisal and 1983, BTM successfully argued to IDA that
its existing branch level accounting machines were totally inadequate and
in the October 1983 amendment to the Credit a new category (Category 7) was
created providing SDR 1 million for office machines and equipment, and for
vehicles (see para 4.35). BTM also argued to IDA that the proposed three
months of consultancy was inadequate, and IDA agreed to a 12-month
technical assistance contract. BTM recruited a technical assistant in 1983
who rapidly concluded that BTM's best interest lay in decentralized real
time processing. Given the cost implication of this, BTM, with IDA
encouragement and finance, recruited a consultant from the French firm,
which was by then working on BTM's audit (psra 5.16), to conduct a critical
appraisal of this proposal. The consultant endorsed the general thrust of
the BTM's proposal and advised that BTM prepare a strategic plan based on
it. In March 1985 IDA reviewed the strategic plan and agreed that the
development of a decentralized banking operation system in the main
branches was well justified.
4.29     It was therefore agreed that the technical assistance should be
extended by two years, that BTH should undertake a study tour of similar
operations in Francophone Africa, and that bidding documents should be
prepared for microcomputers for the main branches, the number to be
determined on a cost benefit calculation, within available financing, once
bids were in.
4.30     In November 1985, BTM launched an ICB and received 13 bids.  The
evaluation of bids identified three best offers, none of which proposed
equipment which existed in Madagascar. Only one of the three suppliers had
an established agency arrangement in the country. IDA participated in a
BTM visit to the European offices of all three suppliers. However, an
immediate decision on supplier was not possible for three reasons:
BTM and IDA disagreed on the evaluation of local service back
up, IDA maintaining that the existence of an existing service
with trained staff, systems and track record should receive
more weight than stated intentions, however promising.
the bid evaluated best by BTM was for relatively untried
equipment to which IDA attributed a high risk factor.



- 18 -
Government independently signed a cooperation agreement with
one of the suppliers for transfer of technology etc., and
wished BTM to select this supplier. 4
4.31     A series of missions and exchanges took place in the first half of
1986. Ultimately the issue was resolved by BTM agreeing to a conditional,
phased contract, with the major equipment delivery being conditional on
satisfactory performance of equipment and vendor during the systems
development phase. This solution allowed IDA to agree BTM's evaluation of
local service back up for the lowest evaluated bid and to accept the level
of risk associated with this untested supplier. The third constraint was
automatically resolved, as the retained bidder was Government's partner.
4.32     The phasing of the contract meant that it could not all be
financed under the existing Credit. Of the total value of PF 9.73 million
($1.50 million), FF 2.64 million ($410,000) was financed on this Credit and
provision for the balance was made in the follow-up Credit (para 7.07).
4.33     IDA agreed with BTM's proposal to further extend the stay of the
technical assistant to manage the software development team; the first
delivery of equipment took place in early 1987.
4.34     Indications are that this much-evolved component is proceeding
successfully and will contribute to the improvement of BTMI's banking
services. The equipment so far (April 1988) is doing well, supplier back-
up is good, and in-house software development is proceeding well and ahead
of schedule. Although non-agricultural clientele will benefit also, an
important feature of the decentralisation is that clientele in provincial
agricultural centres will benefit from greatly improved service. 5

faces this same problem and the issue has been finessed in
various ways in different projects.

H. The Added Components
4.35     As discussed above, the Credit was remodelled in an attempt to
achieve some project objectives in a greatly deteriorated environment. The
major changes to the Credit in three successive amendments (see para 4.01)
brought agricultural inputs, veterinary products and agricultural and
transport equipment into the country at a time when Government's foreign
exchange resources were virtually non-existent; by 1982, debt service on
debt contracted during the misguided 'investissement a outrance" borrrowing
spree of the late 1970's was eating up export revenues, and Government had
not yet begun the adjustment programs which subsequently attracted balance
of payments support from donors. In a real sense, the changes to the BTM
Credit acted as a pilot balance of payments support operation.
4.36     The implementation of this import program (see para 4.08)
reflected caution on IDA's part about systems for allocating foreign
exchange, for identifying priority end uses at a time of penury and about
distribution and absorptive capacity. This caution was perfectly justified
by the dilapidation of economic structures in 1982. Initial programs for
fertilizer were restricted to one area, procurement was by FAO and
distribution was on an agency basis by a commercial firm, with quantities
to be sold specified by location. Initial tractor imports, were done by
commercial firms but only for confirmed clients in two test areas.
Successful implementation and Government's commitment to promotion of the
commercial sector in input and equipment supply allowed the gradual
dismantling of controls. The final imports under -he third amendment to
the Credit, in 1985/6, had controls only on the allocation of foreign
exchange between suppliers (essential in the context of excess demand) and
on procurement procedures. These imports provided a successful model
subsequently followed for the Agricultural Sector Adjustment Credit.
4.37     At the time of the second amendment of the Credit, in October
1983, BTM made a good case for the renewal of its vehicle fleet in rural
branches--supervision of widespread operations required mobility--and 25 4-
wheel drive vehicles were provided for in the amendment. These vehicles
were the subject of ICB, were imported in 1984 and have served successfully
since (providing inter alia an invaluable service to supervision
missionsl). This amendment was well justified at a time when the foreign
exchange crisis made purchase directly by BTH on its own funds impossible.

V. OPERATING PERFORMANCE
A. Bank and BTM Performance
Bank Performance
5.01     The project was regularly supervised (every six months) with a
high degree of continuity. Supervision was done from Nairobi, whereas all
other Madagascar projects were supervised from headquarters. In practice
this was not a problem as links between RMEA and the headquarters
agriculture division were good, and staff from both divisions frequently
worked together in the field. From 1984, links became closer still as RMEA
was reorganised and a section created which became part of the headquarters
division. The three amendments and the linkages of the project to its
successor projects (Agriculture Sector Adjustment Credit, Second
Agricultural Credit Project) were handled harmoniously and efficiently.
The linkages between the project and the evolving banking sector dialogue
between IDA and Government were strong, and the BTM's track record in audit
self-scrutiny (paras 5.10-5.16) was used as a model for other banks.
Technical expertise from EAPIT (training component) and IRMOS (computer
component) was deployed strategically and contributed to the implementation
of those components.
BTM Performance
5.02     BTM proved dynamic and efficient in working with supervision
missions and was fecund in ideas for reorienting the project during
implementation. Excellent workint relations prevailed. Staff chantes at
BTM were relatively few. The institutional structure evolved considerably.
Several intermediate reorganizations also took place. During the project
period the structure and/or title of the unit dealing with mass credit
changed six times and so did its reporting relationship.
5.03     In part, these changes were encouraged by the project.  As part of
the action programs designed to deal with BTM's financial crisis (para
5.13), BTM undertook a reorganisation to separate credit appraisal from
credit recovery, and to set up a credit committee with the objectives of
making credit management sounder and more responsible. As a result of IDA
recommendations, the personnel function was reorganized (para 4.25).
Overall BTM maintained its rating at appraisal of being a well-managed
institution. Financial performance is discussed below (para 5.10 ff).



- 21 -
B. Compliance with Credit Conditions
5.04     The following DCA conditions were not necessarily fulfilled as
intendeds
(i)      IDA-Government-BTM dialogue on agricultural credit
policy. There is no evidence that a dialogue was begun
until the last year of implementation (1986), when a
dialogue was initiated in preparation for the follow up
project (para 7.06).
(ii)      IDA - Government dialogue on agricultural pricing
policy. In practice, from 1983 this dialogue was
conducted as part of an overall sector dialogue, and was
not attempted in the project context; as one supervision
report remarked (November 1982) 'such discuscions in the
context of this project are impractical".
C. Proiect Costs. Credit Use. Procurement
5.05     A traditional comparison of actual costs with estimates is
impossible.  The project evolved into quite a differest animal than that
described at appraisal. This evolution is summarized in the table in para
4.02. Only the provision of mobile banks remained unchanged sufficiently
to be able to say that the component was realized at a unit cost only about
half that estimated at appraisal.
5.06     In procurement, the lengthy dialogue on computer prcurement (para
4.30 f) cost both BTM and IDA substantial sums in missions and discussions.
The resulting compromise was ultimately satisfactory to both parties and
hence justified the costs involved. Given the divergent criteria of
Government, BTM and IDA it is difficult to see that the process could have
been handled differently or more cheaply.
5.07     The procurement procedures for the import programs under
Categories V and VI were appropriate at the time; they provided for ICB for
fertilizers, LCB for other inputs and direct purchase for proprietary
items, subject to ex post checks by BTM. These procedures were fully
discussed with, and understood by, the importers involved and they worked
smoothly.
D. Technical Assistants and Consultants
5.08     The performance of the two technical assistants for training (para
4.24 ff) and the computer component (para 4.28 ff) was satisfactory and
justified the extension of their contracts. They contributed to creating a
permanent capacity with BTM in their respective fields.



- 22 -
5.09     Substantial extra consulting services were written in to the
project at the time of the various amendments: for audit (para 5.16), for
organisation and management (para 5.03), for personnel and training (para
4.25) and for the computer component (para 4.28). BTM obtained most of
these services from a single firm, Guy Barbier (the French branch of Arthur
Anderson), and its associated local firm, Cabinet Fivoarana. Recruitment
from a single, full-service firm gave a coherence to the interventions and
an institution-building effect not often obtained from short-term
consultancy. The constltants involved were uniformly first rate. The cost
was high: BTM expended FF 3.72 million (about $600,000) on these various
services (see Annex 9). However, the cost is justified by the contribution
these services made to maintaining and improving BTM's institutional
strength 4uring a period of uninterrupted crisis.
E. Financial Evolution of BTM
5.1i     At appraisal BTM's financ..al condition was considered sound.
Projections were buoyant over the project period. The reality has been
substantially different. The following table summarizes the position:
In 1979                In 1986
Actual at      As projected   Actual
appraisal      at appraisal
Net profit as X of income       10X             212           1Z
Return on assets employed        1%              2%           0.2%
Return to equity                10%             17X           22
(Source: Annex 13)
5.11     This poor operating performanca reflects BTM's role in the banking
sector crisis (para 2.05 ff).   Effectively, much of BTM's funds were tied
up in loans classified as doubtful (52% of loans in 1981, 33X in 1986).
This situation, first identified by audit in 1983, required continuing
provisions against bad debts in order to build up reserves to adequate
levels. 198316 BTM made massive provisions, reducing net profit to low,
sometimes nominal, levels.  By 1986, provisions had reached 152 of total
loans.
5.12     Even this effort was insufficient to satisfy audit standards and
from 1983 the audit certificate was consistently qualified for
underprovision. In 1986, the auditors recommended raising provisions to
242 of total loans. In addition the 1986 audit report pointed to other
factors of risks-
-    the concentration of lending, one third of loans being to
just 10 enterprises; just 10 enterprises;
-    the declining ratio of capital and reserves to
lending; and



- 23 -
-    the highly illiquid portfolio - many short term
loans having become de facto either long term or altogether
doubtful, a substantial maturity mismatch between resources
and loans had opened up.
5.13     In the face of this, and with the help of the auditors, BTM has
pursued a series of actions plans 1983-8 to redress the situation
comprising:
-    portfolio classification;
-    close follow up of doubtful loans and active
involvement in liquidations, restructuring etc. to recover
outstandings;
-    tighter system, controls and organisation for loan making and
recovery; and
-    maximum bad debts provision, consistent with maintaining
public confidence in the bank.
5.14     As a result, BTM has been able to arrest the deterioration, and
from 1987 the situation began to improve somewhat. At present (April 1988)
Government is considering sector-wide actions to improve the situation of
the banks.
5.15     The causes of this crisis are to some extent exogenous; the
transfer of the burden of financing parastatals from Government to the
banks, together with the very poor performance of all sectors of the
economy in the early 1980s, confronted the banking sector with
extraordinary problems. BTM's systems proved inadequate to evaluate the
risks correctly and to take preventive measures in time. However, to the
credit of management, BTM was the first bank to recognize the problem and
the bank never shrank from undergoing rigorous audit scrutiny, however
unpalatable the results. As a result BTM has emerged in many ways better
equipped for the future, provided it can weather the prerent portfolio
problems.
F. Audit
5.16     At negotiations Government agreed that audit to international
standard should be carried out at BTM; until then, local procedures had
applied. Initially IDA accepted a local firm for this task. This firm,
although reputable, lacked the experience necessery to carry out
specialized bank audit. BTM and IDA therefore agreed that joint audit
should be carried out by the local firm and by Guy Barbier of France,
beginning with the 1982 audit. This association, albeit expensive,
provedfruitful; rigorous standards were set, and a substantial transfer of
expertise to both the local firm ar' BTM took place. Guy Barbier's input
declined each year as local competence grew, but the firm still has a role
in BTM's audit, largely in portfolio analysis, and in setting and following
up the action plans with BTM (para 5.13).

VI. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
6.01     During implementation the project has actually shifted from its
original aim of lending to smallholders to an institutional strengthening
and import program loan which provided foreign exchange for general imports
including fertilizers, pesticides, veterinarian products, tractors and
gricultural equipment. The counterpart funds generated from imports were
passed to BTM to be used to finance both smallholder and general
agricultural lending. BTM management in turn agreed to a series of
measures which intended to help restore BTM's financial standing,
including: (i) annual audits of BTM loan portfolio by an international
auditing firm starting in 1982; (ii) significant bad debt reserves as
recommended by auditors; and (iii) management assistance and reorganization
of key operational divisions. These have definitely proven to be the right
steps to strengthen BTM and have been subsequently incorporated in a
broader financial sector reform to cover all of thi country's banks.
6.02     Because of the wide difference between the appraised project and
actual implementation as stated above, no calculation comparison of
economic returns is either possible or meaningful. The following
indicators give some measure of the impact of the projects

VII. SUMMARY EVALUATION, ISSUES AND LESSONS
7.01     This project evolved so much from its original form that it is
difficult to know by what criteria to judge it. Viewed strictly as an
agricultural credit project, it cannot be judged a success.   The real
value of modern inputs used in agricultural production was certainly less
at completioa than before the project 6 the number of people benefittlng
from the lending is no more than at appraisal 7 and the range of services
available has not changed, although BTM's outreach has improved slightly.
7.02     Against this negative sumiary, the project has probably shored up
a smallholder agricultural credit program that otherwise might well have
collapsed under the pressure; and the conversion of the foreign exchange
into imports for the agricultural sector undoubtedly helped increase
agricultural productivity as conditions in the sector began to improve.
This conversion also helped blaze the trail for subsequent balance of
payments operations.
7.03     The project also provided valuable institutional strengthening to
BTM; in fact, the provision for professional external audit and related
consultancies made a significant contribution not only to the survival of
the BTM but also to the diagnosis and redressment of the whole financial
sector.
7.04     The particular lessons from the experience of this project
include:
a viable way to provide financial services to Madagascar's
smallholders has not yet been developed either in the formal
or the informal sector (paras 4.03 - 4.23).
the Malagasy agricultural economy is predominantly
unmonetized; and significant, stable increases in
profitability and production will be necessary before this
changes. The tendency over the last ten years has been in
the opposite direction.
7.05     In addition to these particular issues, the project illustrates
some general truths about the design of agricultural credit projects:
6/      Smallholder lending in 1980 bought 12,100 t of fertilizer.  In
1986 it bought 10,000 t, in 1987, 2,900 t.
7/      Small farmer borrowers numbered 20,100 in 1980.  In 1986 they
numbered 24,700, in 1987, 17,200.

the careful analysis at appraisal of profitability by crop,
and the careful supervision by the intermediary to ensure
that loans are used for the purpose intended, often prove
useless, as funds are fungible and go to the farmer's
priority.  BTM loans were often invested in other activities
and repaid from other sources. What matters is whether they
are repaid.
involvement only in lending ane not in other financial
services, particularly savings, hobbled the BTM, depriving it
of a real knowledge of the economies of farmers and their
communities. Rural financial services, not agricultural
credit, should be the development goal.
this project failed in large measure because an agricultural
services project can only work in a conducive policy context,
and in association with other minimal conditions - extension,
input supply, marketing, prices.  The covenant that
Government discuss prices with IDA was no substitute for
basic sectoral profitability.
.    appraisal paid little attention to the lending and recovery
process, yet this proved vital. Any successful intervention
in rural finance should emphasize management.
.   BTM's lending to agricultural production is minimal.  The
overwhelming proportion of its credit to the sector goes to
financing crop marketing. Despite constant fluctuation in
the profitability of each crop, this activity is on the whole
well managed and profitable for BTM. This contribution to
rural finance washes back rapidly upstream to production.
Increasing the volume and efficiency of this lending (demand
is not lacking) represents a better means of promoting
agricultural production at present than direct lending to
production, for which the vehicle is still not proven.
Follow-Up Proiect
7.06     Some of these lessons have been incorporated into a Second
Agricultural Credit project for which an IDA Credit (Cr. 1804 MAG) of $10.0
million became effective in late 1987. The t.lk of this second project
provides DFC--type funding to agriculture SMES, and represents a quite
different project from the first project, which had an overwhelmingly
smallholder emphasis. In effect, this shift in emphasis acknowledges that
the formula for providing financial services to the vast mass of
Madagascar's farmers has not yet been worked out. The second project does
provide continuing support for the BTM's pilot project, however, and funds
for a study of rural financial markets. It is hoped that these two
components will provide guidance for future development. Current thinking
is that solutions can only be found in voluntary association of farmers and
some form of mutual sav.:ngs and loan formula. This remains for the moment
at the level of an idea.

7.07     The second project also provides continuity of institution
building support, with continued funding for participation of an
international firm in audit and the action programs, and with funds for
technical assistance and hardware to complete the computer component.
7.08     The second project may thus prepare the way for a further IDA
investment in finance for smallholders but, given the failure of the first
project, great caution and a palpably successful formula will be absolute
prerequisites.
