F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The overall objectives of the Project are to minimize the threat in Nepal posed to humans
by highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) infection and other zoonotic diseases by
controlling such infections among domestic poultry and to prepare for, control, and
respond to an influenza epidemic and other related infectious disease emergencies in
humans. These objectives were to be achieved in three types of interventions: (i)
prevention; (ii) preparedness and planning; and (iii) response and containment. If these
goals were achieved, the Project would reduce the burden of disease, the consequent
economic losses, the risk of human infection and the loss of productivity attributable to
human infections in Nepal and limit the spread to other countries as well.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.1.1 Nepal is a landlocked Himalayan country of 24 million people, bordering India and
China. In 2006, Nepal was at high risk of avian influenza (AI) outbreaks in poultry, because of
reported AI outbreaks in wild birds in China and poultry in India.5 The border controls with these
countries were limited on the flow of both animals and humans. In addition, Nepal is on two
routes for migratory birds. Out of all 75 districts in Nepal, 26 districts bordering India were at
high-risk, and another 18 districts were at medium-risk. The ability to detect AI in the country
was severely handicapped due to lack of physical access, related to Nepal’s rugged terrain and
widespread security problems.

1.1.2 Poultry is an important sub-sector of agriculture in Nepal. In 2006, there were an
estimated 22 million poultry and 408,000 ducks in Nepal. The poultry industry employed
approximately 400,000 people, and provided livelihoods to millions of rural households.
Approximately 45 percent of these poultry were hybrid and found in a few large commercial
farms located in peri-urban areas. On the other hand, about 55 percent were indigenous fowls
and kept in backyard units by around 50 percent of rural households across Nepal. Most of the
commercial farms had some bio-security arrangements in place, but the rest of the supply chain
was unorganized. Birds were transported in traditional baskets and butchered in the open air with
no standard safe disposal mechanism for waste material.

1.1.3 Animal health. The Department of Livestock Services (DLS), under the Ministry of
Agriculture and Cooperatives (MOAC), had a well-knit veterinary service delivery
infrastructure, supported by a central veterinary hospital, 75 district livestock service offices, and
999 livestock service centers at the village level. DLS had and still has 132 livestock officers,
178 veterinary officers, 1,000 para-vets, and 6,000 village animal health workers.6 There were
eight veterinary laboratories in Nepal, three at the central and five at the regional levels7. DLS
also had nine Animal Quarantine Offices8 supported by 24 Animal Quarantine Check Posts at
borders.

1.1.4 Human health. A public health service delivery system was reasonably well established
in Nepal with the Ministry of Health and Population (MOHP) at the center, five regional health
directorates, regional and zonal hospitals, and district level hospitals. All 75 districts had public
health offices and district hospitals with an outreach network of 188 primary health care centers,


5
  Source: World Organization for Animal Health (OIE). The first outbreak in China was reported in 2005. In 2006,
India reported first outbreaks in mid-west (Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, and Gujarat).
6
  In addition, there were approximately 500 private veterinarians and 10,000 private para-vets. They were either
attached to the private commercial entities, such as commercial poultry firms or farm stores.
7
  The three laboratories are: Central Veterinary Laboratory (CVL), National Avian Disease Investigation Laboratory
(NADIL), and Foot and Mouth Disease/Trans-boundary Animal Diseases (FMD/TADs) Laboratory. The Five
Regional Veterinary Laboratories are located in every region: eastern (Biratnagar), central (Janakpur), western
(Pokhara), mid-western (Surkhet) and far-western (Dhangadhi).
8
  One is at the central level, and the remaining eight are at the regional level (each quarantine office is responsible
for two to three border districts.
                                                                                                                     1
698 village health posts and 3,219 sub-health posts. However, the health system was constrained
by quality of care and access, which was being addressed by the Nepal Health Sector Program
(NHSP I, a SWAp supported by IDA, DFID and other partners).

1.1.5 Coordination. The Government of Nepal (GON) set up an inter-sectoral task force under
the chairmanship of the Director-General of Health Services. In early-2006, MOAC and MOHP
jointly prepared a National Avian Influenza and Influenza Pandemic Preparedness and Response
Plan (NAIIPPRP), with assistance from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO). This Plan was formally endorsed by the GON and was later
supplemented by an operational plan. The coordination function was shifted to the Technical
Sub-committee on Avian Influenza (TSCAI) under the Central National Disaster Relief
Committee. TSCAI was jointly chaired by the Secretaries of MOAC and MOHP.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

1.2.1 The overall objectives of the Project were to minimize the threat in Nepal posed to
humans by highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) infection and other zoonotic diseases by
controlling such infections among domestic poultry and to prepare for, control, and respond to
an influenza epidemic and other related infectious disease emergencies in humans. These
objectives were to be achieved in three types of interventions: (i) prevention; (ii) preparedness
and planning; and (iii) response and containment. As a result, AICP was to reduce the burden of
disease, the consequent economic losses, the risk of human infection, and the loss of productivity
attributable to human infections in Nepal. It was also to limit the spread of the disease to other
countries. The PDO indicators were as follows:

    (a) Positive behavior change related to avian influenza among three groups:                      (i) poultry
        farmers, (ii) health workers, and (iii) general population
    (b) Continued absence of HPAI in poultry and effective containment of HPAI infection in
        poultry in case of outbreaks

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification

1.3.1 The PDO and key indicators remained unchanged. However, 15 of the 18 intermediate
outcome indicators were revised, clarified, or dropped at restructuring approved on March 5,
2010. Substantial changes were made to the following two intermediate results indicators (the
details are provided in Annex 2).

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

1.4.1 The project was intended to benefit 24 million people in Nepal, by reducing (i) the
burden of disease in poultry and the consequent economic losses; and (ii) the risk of human
infection and the loss of productivity attributable to human infections through increased
awareness of AI prevention. Specifically, the project was intended to benefit the following target
groups:
    (a) Poultry farmers (both commercial and backyard), who would benefit from increased
        awareness about preventive measures against AI, improved bio-security, and
        compensation, in case of outbreaks;
    (b) Veterinary networks, laboratories, disease surveillance systems, and hospitals that would
        benefit from improved facilities, equipments, reagents, antiviral drugs, and training;
    (c) The participating ministries (MOAC and MOHP) which would benefit from training and
        capacity building as well as provision of transportation and equipment thereby making
        them better prepared to deal with outbreaks of AI and other zoonoses and infectious
        diseases; and
    (d) Consumers and other stakeholders who would benefit from being better informed and
        aware of the risks to human health.

1.5 Original Components

1.5.1 The project consisted of four components: (a) animal health, (b) human health, (c)
communication, and (d) project management. The original total project cost was US$18.2
million, including physical and price contingencies of US$2.37 million9. The base project cost
was US$15.83 million.

1.5.2 Component A. Animal Health (US$6.12 million, 38.7 percent of the base project cost)
to support national prevention and control strategies by the following five subcomponents. This
component was implemented by DLS, with technical support from FAO:
     Sub-component A.1: Surveillance to develop and strengthen: (a) surveillance and
       epidemiological investigation; (b) participatory disease intelligence; (c) capacity building
       of veterinary and wildlife professionals and poultry entrepreneurs; and (d) Geographic
       Information System (GIS)-based animal disease surveillance and information system.
     Sub-component A.2: Prevention and containment to strengthen animal quarantine
       infrastructure, including provision of transportation.
     Sub-component A.3: Laboratory capacity to upgrade FMD)/TAD laboratory to BSL3
       and other seven veterinary laboratories (two central and five regional) to bio-security
       level 2 (BSL2).
     Sub-component A.4: Field Veterinary Services to establish rapid response teams
       (RRTs) in all 75 districts for containment and sero-surveillance and to provide equipment.
     Sub-component A.5: Compensation fund to set up rates and mechanism for affected
       backyard as well as commercial farmers.



9
 Physical contingencies were 5 percent of the total base project costs of US$15.83 million, which was US$0.79
million. Likewise, price contingencies were 10 percent of the total base costs and were US$1.58 million.
                                                                                                           3
1.5.3 Component B. Human Health (US$6.34 million, 40 percent of the base project cost) to
prevent a human influenza epidemic caused by HPAI and other communicable diseases by the
following three subcomponents. The component was implemented by DOHS, under MOHP,
with support from WHO.
     Sub-component B.1: Surveillance and Laboratory Strengthening by (a) training
       district and regional RRTs in surveillance and diagnosis; (b) improving influenza-like-
       illness (ILI) reporting through the Early Warning and reporting System (EWARS)
       network; (c) enhancing human AI and viral pneumonia surveillance through the
       WHO/Immunization Preventable Diseases (IPD) system; (d) upgrading the National
       Public Health Laboratory (NPHL) to BSL3; and (e) establishing the Laboratory
       Information Management System.
     Sub-component B.2: Prevention and containment to support: (a) prevention of avian
       and seasonal influenza in high-risk occupational settings, (b) prevention of transmission
       in high-risk contacts of persons diagnosed with AI, (c) planning for acquisition and use of
       pandemic influenza vaccine, (d) development of a quarantine network for Nepal (later
       substituted by the establishment of travel advisory during pandemic), (e) legal and
       regulatory review, and (f) planning for non-pharmacologic interventions to contain
       human avian and pandemic influenza.
     Sub-component B.3: Health care delivery system preparedness and response. This
       sub-component was to (a) develop an acute respiratory disease (ARD) triage and referral
       system, (b) support planning for the primary care system in meeting health care needs
       during an influenza pandemic; and (c) establishment of negative pressure isolation wards
       at referral hospitals and validation with O&M manuals.

1.5.4 Component C. Communication (US$1.65 million, 10.4 percent of the base project cost)
to reduce the negative social impact and threat to human health posed by AI outbreaks in poultry
through advocacy, behavioral change communication, and social mobilization. This component
was implemented jointly by DLS and the National Health Education Information
Communication Center (NHEICC), under MOHP. The United Nations Children’s Fund
(UNICEF) provided technical support and implemented the Community Based School Education
Program (CB-SEP) in eight districts. 10

1.5.5 Component D. Project management (US$1.72 million, 10.9 percent of the base project
cost) to support project management, including financial management (FM), procurement,
safeguards and monitoring and evaluation (M&E), as well as operational costs for both DLS and
DOHS.

1.6 Revised Components

1.6.1 The four components remained unchanged throughout the project implementation, with
one exception. There were changes in the laboratory capacity sub-components in both animal
and human health, because of the cancellation of construction of two BSL3 laboratories. Instead



10
 The funds are allocated through DLS (animal health related activities) and DOHS (human health related activities).
DLS was accountable for the UNICEF allocation. The AICP financed CB-SEP in five districts.
                                                                                                                4
of upgrading two laboratories to BSL3 (one veterinary and one public health) and seven
veterinary laboratories to BSL2, the project upgraded all nine laboratories to BSL2.

1.7 Other significant changes

1.7.1 The project was restructured twice: partial cancellation of US$2.28 million in March
2010 and reallocation between categories in January 2011. The partial cancellation was related
mostly to cancellation of budgetary allocation for two BSL3 laboratories. AICP, instead,
upgraded these two laboratories to BSL2. It also changed the veterinary surveillance to focus on
commercial farms in 12 selected high-risk districts (out of all 26 high-risk districts) from border
patrol. Quarantine and bio-security were to be improved by trans-border workshops and training.
As a result of these changes, the total project cost was reduced to US$17 million, and 15 of 18
intermediate outcome indicators were revised or clarified (details are provided in Annex 2).

1.7.2 The reallocation between categories dealt with the unallocated US$ 684,75211 that was
made available for the animal health component. This filled a financing gap in the animal health
component that was created by an outbreak response in October 2010 and the Bank positively
responded to request from the GON.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

2.1.1 The project design contained both emergency response and longer-term institutional
capacity building to prevent and control HPAI and other zoonotic diseases. It adopted the Global
Program for Avian Influenza (GPAI)12 and incorporated lessons learned from the on-going HPAI
projects in Asia and other Bank-supported projects in Nepal. These lessons included
establishment of a compensation fund at flat rate to enable rapid reimbursement and
strengthening weak procurement and M&E capacities at DLS and DOHS by hiring consultants.
Due to outbreaks in neighboring India and China in 2006, the original AICP emphasized poultry
surveillance at border crossing and quarantine.

2.1.2 In strengthening diagnostic capacities, the pros and cons of constructing two BSL3
laboratories in veterinary and public health were discussed extensively with GON stakeholders
and UN counterparts (FAO and WHO). The Bank team flagged its concerns at pre-appraisal
about the substantial investment and operating cost requirements of BSL3, particularly staffing
demands. Although HPAI diagnosis would be possible by BSL2, other stakeholders argued that
the construction of two BSL3 laboratories was justified to strengthen system capacity beyond
HPAI and to enable rapid in-country confirmation. The Government was concerned that


11
  Because of XDR appreciation in conversion at partial cancellation, the balance was placed as unallocated.
12
  GPAI was endorsed by the Bank’s Board of Directors in January 2006, as a horizontal adaptable program loan
(APL) with a global envelope of $500 million. GPAI was developed in 2005, at the height of the H5N1 spread in
humans in several Asian countries. As AI virus constantly evolves with unpredictable results, the risk of a human
pandemic was considered highly likely. Because of the multi-sectoral nature, involving health, agriculture,
economics, finance, planning, and others, the Bank was considered the best suited institution to effectively
coordinate UN and other specialized agencies, including FAO, WHO, and UNICEF.
                                                                                                               5
depending on an external reference laboratory would delay confirmation of AI, which in turn
could delay AI containment by three weeks.13

2.2 Implementation

2.2.1 The implementation progress was rated moderately satisfactory. Although the project was
a time sensitive emergency operation, the implementation had a slow start, largely due to delayed
procurement of UN partners and staffing of key positions at both DLS and DOHS on a full-time
basis. FAO and WHO were to provide turnkey technical support to DLS and DOHS, respectively,
in designing BSL3, developing surveillance programs, providing technical training, and
procuring personal protective equipment (PPE) and anti-virals. Likewise, UNICEF was to
support DLS and NHEICC in developing a communication program and messages and to
implement a Community Based School Education Program (CB-SEP). About one year after
project effectiveness, the three UN agencies (FAO, WHO and UNICEF) were contracted under
blanket agreements, 14 and the implementation started picking up around mid-2008. The
communication program was launched in March 2008, and DLS and DOHS developed Standard
Operating Procedures (SOPs) in containment and compensation, surveillance, laboratory
protocol, case management, and communication. The SOPs were translated into Nepali and
tested during the first HPAI outbreaks in Jhapa district in early-200915 and the H1N1 pandemic
in end-2009 16 . In Jhapa, 164 birds died with infection, and 27,724 birds were culled. 164
commercial farmers and around 1,200 backyard farmers were affected. There was a delay in
providing compensation, because the rates were not accepted by these farmers (detailed in Annex
2). Despite the successful containment and case management, both DLS and DOHS had
difficulty in building institutional capacities in prevention and preparedness, such as
strengthening surveillance and diagnostics. By the Mid-term Review (MTR) in July 2009, only
34 percent of the grant was disbursed.

2.2.2 There was a substantial delay in designing the veterinary and public health BSL3
laboratories, due to later-than-expected contracting of FAO and WHO and global high demand
for limited technical expertise for this purpose. At MTR in July 2009, the Bank and the
Government had extensive discussions and agreed on cancelling the funds allocated for the
construction of the BSL3 laboratories, because (a) there was about 84 percent increase in needed
investments compared to the estimate at appraisal, which could not be financed within the
project envelope;17 (b) recurrent costs were estimated at approximately US$300,000 per year for
the two laboratories, that would not break-even at expected future operating levels;18 and (c) civil

14
   There was no prior agreement on the scope of the United Nations (UN) involvement and financial terms. The
blanket agreements amounted to US$2.39 million with FAO, US$2.20 million with WHO, and US$ 360,000 with
UNICEF.
15
   Two outbreaks were contained in January and February 2009 in Jhapa district in the southeast, bordering West
Bengal, India.
16
   There were 174 cases in Nepal, plus 3 deaths. See
http://www.searo.who.int/EN/Section10/Section2562_15047.htm (accessed in December 2011)
17
   The construction cost for two BSL3 laboratories was estimated at US$1.85 million at appraisal. However, the
revised cost was US$3.4 million at MTR.
18
   This consists of normal recurrent cost of US$200,000 and auxiliary generator operation of US$96,000. The
reference laboratory in the United Kingdom (UK) charges approximately US$15 per sample, and its continued use
                                                                                                             6
work would not be completed by the time the project closed. While the confirmation of positives
by a local BSL3 would be faster, the saving in time would make little difference to containment
practices, as the adopted SOPs call for a positive diagnosis based on the rapid test to trigger an
immediate outbreak response in the field. By mid-2009, AICP improved the diagnostic capacity
at CVL, which became 90 percent consistent with the OIE reference laboratory.

2.2.3 Instead of building two BSL3 laboratories, the project focused on upgrading nine
laboratories (eight veterinary and one public health) to BSL2. With support from FAO, AICP
also revised poultry surveillance at MTR to focus on commercial farms in 12 selected high-risk
districts (out of all 26 high-risk districts), in particular, cross-border trade routes, rather than
surveillance at the border crossing. In complementing DLS capacities in quarantine and
communication, trans-border quarantine workshops were also included. These changes were
translated into a new implementation plan, with a net cost savings of US$ 2.28 million (about 13
percent of the original project cost). While the agreement in restructuring was reached at the
right time (at MTR in July 2009), it took almost eight months for the restructuring package to be
approved (on March 5, 2010). This was, however, less than the 12- month average for Nepal.

2.2.4 The restructuring included a partial cancellation of the above savings. In early-2010,
there were eight HPAI outbreaks19, and AICP culled 29,347 birds20 and destroyed 4,512 eggs,
114 kg of bird feed, and 149 kg of poultry meat. The compensation amounted to NRS 2,912,260
(approximately, US$ 41,000) and was paid on time to both backyard and commercial farmers.
By mid-2010, disbursement improved from 38 to 62 percent. In June 2010, GON made a request
for an additional US$ 1.6million to enhance veterinary response capacity,21 to be financed by
AHIF. The Bank team indicated its willingness to support the AHIF application, provided that
project implementation accelerated and IDA disbursement improved to 75 percent by September
2010.22 This, however, was not achieved, thus, no additional financing was sought.

2.2.5 In 2011, the disbursement was steady but lagging, because of delayed consolidation of
regional and district level expenditures at both DLS and DOHS (detailed in paragraph 2.4.2). By
project closure, AICP completed implementation of the planned activities, including upgrading
the nine laboratories to BSL2. However, the BSL2 at NPHL (designated as the National
Influenza Center), and the isolation wards at Shukraraj Tropical Infectious Diseases Hospital
(designated as the National Referral Hospital), were not yet fully operational. The O&M training



would be more cost effective. According to the cost benefit analysis, BSL3 would need to process an average of
8,000 samples per year to break even, representing 100 times the number of samples tested during the outbreaks
recorded todate in 2009 for the next 25 years. This implies a 20-fold increase of the likely figure of five outbreaks
per year, while the current figure of 80 samples per year as recorded in the outbreaks of 2009 would translate into a
prohibitive average of US$3,700 per sample.
19
   Seven HPAI outbreaks occurred in Kaski, Chitwan, Rupandehi, Dang, Banke, and Kailali districts between
January and March 2010. There was one outbreak in Chitwan in October 2010. Except for Kaski in Central Nepal,
these districts bordering India.
20
   This includes 28,115 poultry, 886 ducks and 346 pigeons. These were mostly backyard, but there were a few
commercial Muscovy ducks in Kaski and 11,437 commercial layers in Chitwan.
21
   The proposal was to finance warehouse construction, quarantine office renovation, laboratory upgrading,
additional transportation, and SMS gateway.
22
   The team estimated that this would have given sufficient time to satisfactorily implement the planned activities
under the Trust Fund (TF) by the IDA project closure date.
                                                                                                                   7
was not undertaken, because relevant technical staff was not yet appointed by MOHP.
Surveillance activities carried out under the project actually exceeded original plans, as the
surveillance was carried out in all 26 high risk districts, rather than the planned 12 districts.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

2.3.1 The project M&E is rated modest. The M&E framework was designed by adopting the
GPAI results framework. However, the project framework could have been better structured to
capture all aspects of PDOs by upgrading a few intermediate results indicators related to
prevention and institutional preparedness.

2.3.2 Although there were some improvements during implementation, both DLS and DOHS
were weak in data collection and reporting. Initially, only a few outputs were reported to the
Bank, such as number of samples collected in poultry surveillance. Neither DLS nor DOHS was
able to report on PDO or intermediate outcome indicators until after MTR. The March 5, 2010
restructuring revised or clarified most intermediate outcome indicators, and made those more
relevant in measuring focused surveillance in high-risk districts and diagnostic capacity
development. This helped both DLS and DOHS report project outputs and progress towards the
results framework to the Bank. The communication activities were well-monitored by UNICEF
by three Knowledge, Attitude, and Practice (KAP) surveys. 23 While general awareness was
captured by these surveys, the project did not obtain AI awareness data among poultry farmers
and health workers (PDO indicator) separately. It would have been useful to have an M&E
consultant to ensure that the data collection was segregated by target group and/or gender,
reporting on the results framework, and utilizing all M&E data for planning and reporting. It
would have also helped to properly document good practices in more quantitative and qualitative
terms, for example, on in-kind compensation and Civil Society Organization (CSO) mobilization
in stamping-out operations.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

2.4.1 Safeguards. AICP was assessed as a Category B project in environmental safeguards.
DLS prepared the Environment Management Plan (EMP), including waste management (safe
disposal of carcasses) in July 2006. Additional protocols were also developed on safe handling of
chemicals and development and management of burial pits. DOHS applied the health care waste
management plan developed in June 2006 for the Nepal Health Sector Program (SWAp
supported by IDA and other partners).

2.4.2 Outbreak containment was managed by the District Avian Influenza Technical
Committee (DAITEC), composed of a Chief District Officer, municipalities, District
Development Committee (DDC), District DLS, and District DOHS. DAITEC was to identify the
disposal pit location and maintain its safety, including groundwater quality. During the outbreak
in Pokhara (Kaski district) in early-2010, DAITEC promised a community nearby the disposal
pit to rehabilitate their main access road. This was not completed by the project closure, and DLS


23
  Baseline was financed by the Government of Japan, and AICP financed two other surveys. UNICEF also
undertook mini-KAP surveys annually.
                                                                                                  8
is following up with DAITEC. A groundwater quality test was not undertaken during project
implementation. However, DLS is also committed to undertake this task as a part of GON’s
annual program.

2.4.3 Financial management (FM). FM was rated moderately unsatisfactory. The capacity
was strengthened over time at both DLS and DOHS, but it remained weak due to limited staff
capacity and frequent staff turnover, which was affected by the overall weak country FM
environment. Although the March 5, 2010 restructuring improved implementation and
disbursement, a mismatch between expenditure and disbursement developed, because of delays
in reconciliation at the central level. This was a challenge, particularly for DLS, which had 84
cost centers at the central, district, and municipal levels24 (DOHS had only seven centers in 5
regions and Kathmandu). FM information systems were developed at both DLS and DOHS, but
the system was not operational at DOHS. The submission of trimester FM reports and audit
reports were delayed most of the time due to weak capacity as well as slow reconciliation of the
accounts with various cost centers. In 2009, disbursement had to be suspended for both
Departments due to delayed submission of audited accounts.

2.4.4 Procurement. Procurement was rated moderately unsatisfactory. Capacity was built at
both DLS and DOHS over time, although limited. Despite weak capacities at both Departments,
the procurement plan was frontloaded, in enhancing emergency response. USAID and FAO
provided procurement support to DOHS and DLS, respectively, and staff was trained at the
Nepal Administrative Staff College. However, both DLS and DOHS received complaints from
bidders, one of which dealt with the veterinary BSL2 equipment package (worth US$ 850,000),
which had to be investigated by the Bank’s Department of Institutional Integrity (INT) as well as
the GON Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority. The case was cleared, but a
new tender had to be issued with less detailed specifications (such as brand names). This delayed
commissioning of veterinary BSL2 at the central and regional levels.

2.5 Post-completion Operation

2.5.1 Given the history of HPAI outbreaks in Nepal, it is critical to continue effective
surveillance for prevention and control. GON is committed to sustain the key prevention and
control activities and has made the following budgetary allocation for the FY 2011/12: NRS60
million (approximately US$800,000) for DLS, NRS13 million (approximately US$160,000) for
DOHS, and NRS400,000 (about US$5,000) for NHEICC (under MOHP). To ensure rapid
containment of HPAI outbreaks and disease surveillance in high-risk districts, DLS is
maintaining the AICP structure to construct a warehouse with their own resources. DLS, with the
AICP structure, rapidly responded to HPAI outbreak in Bhaktapur in November 2011, several
months after project closing. The human health investments in surveillance and diagnostics
would be sustained by DOHS epidemiology and disease control division and NIC with support
from WHO and the Government’s Second HNP and HIV/AIDS Program. In addition, the AHIF-
financed South Asia Regional Training Program in Epidemiology and Bio-security would also

  49 centers were under MOAC (in Kathmandu and districts), while 35 were at District Development Committees
under the Ministry of Local Development (MOLD).
                                                                                                         9
strengthen in-country as well as regional epidemiology capacities in veterinary and public
health.25

2.5.2 Building on AICP investments, additional support26 to further strengthen DLS and DOHS
capacities to prevent and control infectious diseases that transmit between animals and humans
(zoonoses) is proposed. This would be financed by AHIF and would complement the on-going
Poverty Alleviation Fund activities at community level, as well as two projects under
preparation: the Agriculture and Food Security Project (to be financed by the Global Agriculture
and Food Security Program - GAFSP)27 and the Resilience to Climate Related Hazards Project
(to be financed by the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience, PPCR). In addition to enhancing
surveillance, diagnostics, climate sensitive disease risk mitigation, and communication, the
proposed AHIF support would strengthen bio-security and food safety throughout the poultry or
meat product value chains by piloting establishment of model live bird/meat markets. The pilot
would be a replication of good practice in the Bank’s HPAI projects in Vietnam and Nigeria.28

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

3.1.1 AICP’s relevance to objectives, design, and implementation were high. The objectives
remained relevant to the Nepal Interim Strategy Note (ISN) (FY08-FY0929 and FY10-FY11).
AICP supported pillar III “promoting access to better quality services? by improving public
health service delivery in preventing and managing HPAI and other communicable diseases.
While Nepal did not have any HPAI case in humans, the institutional mechanism was tested
during the H1N1 outbreaks in 2009. The project also strengthened veterinary service delivery in
prevention and response to HPAI outbreaks in the poultry sector, which supports rural
livelihoods and nutrition for vulnerable groups (see Section 3.5).

3.1.2 The project design remained relevant in addressing both emergency and longer-term
institutional capacity building to prepare for, prevent, and control HPAI outbreaks. The design
adopted the GPAI framework, but the key activities such as surveillance and diagnostics were
adjusted at the March 5, 2010 restructuring on the basis of HPAI status in Nepal and cost benefit
analysis of constructing and operating two BSL3 laboratories (see Section 2.2). Also, the project
implementation was consistent with Nepal’s development priorities. The project successfully
contained 10 HPAI outbreaks in poultry and strengthened DLS and DOHS capacities in


25
   The Regional Training Program in Epidemiology and Bio-security trained 70 veterinarians and medical doctors
from seven countries in South Asia to obtain master’s degree in epidemiology. Five students are participating from
Nepal (two veterinarians and three medical doctors). The program will also set up centers of excellence in
epidemiology by strengthening existing epidemiology institutions and developing national and regional networks.
The total cost of the program is US$7.7 million.
26
   The proposed follow-on project would seek approximately US$10 million from AHIF to support (a) surveillance
and diagnostics, (b) bio-security and quarantine, (c) model live bird/meat market, (d) climate sensitive disease risk
mitigation, (e) communication, and (f) institutional strengthening.
27
   GAFSP approved the allocation of US$46.5 million for Nepal. PPCR approved US$86 million for Nepal, of
which $25-30 million would be dedicated to strengthening warning systems for climate related hazards.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

3.2.1 The project achieved its PDO. AICP minimized the threat posed by H5N1 to humans and
the poultry industry by (a) successfully containing 10 HPAI outbreaks in poultry birds with no
transmission to humans and strengthening veterinary and public health diagnostic capacities with
high consistencies with reference laboratories (90-100 percent); (b) preventing HPAI or other
zoonotic disease outbreaks in birds or humans by enhanced surveillance network (95 percent
commercial farms surveyed in all 26 high-risk districts, and 86 percent EWARS coverage
nationwide); (c) improving preparedness by reviewing relevant legal frameworks, developing
and testing 11 SOPs; and (d) increasing HPAI awareness by 21 percent points (from 61 to 82
percent). Two PDO indicators were achieved, although the level of awareness was not made
available by target group. All technical intermediate results indicators were achieved, with
shortfalls recorded in the two project management indicators (details are in ICR datasheet). The
key project achievements are summarized below (and detailed in Annex 2).

3.2.2 Response and containment. AICP successfully contained 10 HPAI outbreaks in poultry,
ducks, and pigeons, with no transmission to humans. Compensation was established at an
acceptable rate for poultry (detailed in Annex 2) and paid to affected farmers on time (except for
those affected by the first HPAI outbreak in 2009). The package also included in-kind hybrid
chicks for backyard farmers and optional credit for re-stocking for commercial farmers. As a
result, affected backyard farmers doubled their income following the HPAI outbreak from sales
of eggs and meat of the hybrid poultry.30 Despite the 10 outbreaks, there was an increase in the
number of poultry birds in Nepal by about 11 percent (24.5 million). The population of ducks,
however, declined by about 7 percent (380,000).31 The rapid response capacity was enhanced
due to improved diagnostic capacity: rapid test results at CVL were 90 percent consistent with
those at OIE reference laboratory, and quality control tests at NPHL were 100 percent consistent
with WHO’s reference laboratory. While construction of two BSL3 laboratories was cancelled,
nine laboratories, including CVL and NPHL, were upgraded to BSL2. NPHL, however, was not
fully operational, due to inadequate staffing. With support from WHO, AICP provided 2,500
personal protective equipment32 and 6,300 courses of anti-virals, which fully covered the needs
for targeted animal and human health workers in all 26 high-risk districts. During the H1N1
pandemic, DOHS set up 12 travel advisory health desks for international and domestic travelers
and reduced the H1N1 transmission by identifying 39 suspected cases33.

3.2.3 Prevention. The active and focused poultry surveillance was operational in all 26 high-
risk districts, monitoring 95 percent commercial and 25 percent backyard farmers. During
implementation, AICP doubled district coverage to monitor all 26 high-risk districts (as
compared to 12 originally planned districts) and exceeded the backyard surveillance target by 10


30
   This was confirmed by a field visit by the Bank team in June 2011 during the final supervision/ICR mission.

percent points. Eight pick-ups and 22 motorcycles were provided to enhance surveillance
capacity in high-risk districts. The GIS-based, Global Positioning System (GPS) centric animal
disease information system (e.g., TADinfo) was also established, linking nine institutions,
including DLS and five regional veterinary laboratories. Eighty eight (88) percent of the
EWARS surveillance sites regularly submitted reports to DOHS, which exceeded the 80 percent
target.

3.2.4 Preparedness and planning. AICP developed 11 SOPs (five by DLS and six by DOHS),
including surveillance, quarantine, response (containment, home/community based-care, clinical
case management, and infection control), laboratory, environment management, and risk
communication. DLS also reviewed three legal frameworks, including Bird Flu Control Order, to
enable containment activities, and DOHS prepared the Communicable Disease Control Act.
SOPs were tested and refined by responding to 10 HPAI outbreaks and H1N1 pandemic. DLS
undertook eight simulation exercises in collaboration with USAID and FAO. In enhancing
district planning, DOHS distributed non-pharmaceutical intervention plans to all 75 districts, 18
of which (24 percent) prepared their own plan with USAID support.34

3.2.5 AI awareness. A comprehensive HPAI communication program was launched in 2008
and increased the HPAI awareness by 21 percent from baseline. The end-line KAP survey also
indicates that there was a 60 percent points increase in knowledge on AI preventive measures
among adult family members who are likely to handle their backyard poultry (detailed in Section
3.6). This was enabled by media and training outreach implemented in coordination among DLS,
NHEICC, and UNICEF, in particular, UNICEF’s CB-SEP. In 8 selected high-risk districts (out
of 26 high-risk districts), UNICEF trained 183,000 students and teachers on HPAI and its
prevention practices and also built capacities of 64 CSOs in developing district level risk
communication networks.35 The media awareness campaign covered at least 50 percent of the
population in 26 high-risk districts.36 AICP also trained 750 media spokespersons on HPAI, and
1,703 security personnel, traders, and farmers on bio-security and quarantine.

3.3 Efficiency

3.3.1 The project’s efficiency was high. The economic analysis (detailed in Annex 3) related
the project costs to the benefits derived from the economic value stream of losses, which were
avoided from project activities in the poultry industry. This was expressed as the expected value
of the economic loss avoided from outbreaks in a seven-year period (2008-2014). Project
benefits are assumed to remain realizable over this period and beyond, attributable to the project
expenditures on laboratories, equipment, awareness programs, and increase in human capital
from the projects training activities. Under the “without project? scenario, it was assumed that
after the 2009-2010 outbreaks - with about 17 percent of the poultry population being lost (as in

35
   AICP financed the implementation in five districts. UNICEF mobilized 64 CSOs of women, micro-credit, local
ethnic groups, para-legal and/or youth (eight organizations per district) and formed DDCs. Eight hundred (800)
 committee members were trained on hand-washing, AI prevention, and risk communication.
36
   Messages were aired on one national television and 26 local FM radio stations. The April 2006 Aide Memoire
indicates that the access to radio is estimated at 50 percent for rural population and 62 percent for urban but access
to television estimated at 1 percent for rural and 20 percent for urban.
                                                                                                                  12
the case of Vietnam during the 2003-2004 outbreaks) - the GON would have immediately
implemented AICP to contain further outbreaks. Consequently, by 2014, after its completion the
“with? and “without? situation would become the same in terms of preparedness, control, and
results. The costs, benefits, and results of the economic analysis were based on the above
assumptions and parameters for the avoided losses in the poultry sector. The results are very
robust, with a 311 percent economic rate of return (ERR) and a net present value (NPV) of
US$34.8 million.

3.3.2 A sensitivity analysis concerning the Gross Attack Rate (GAR) in the poultry sector in
the “without project? situation during the 2009-2010 outbreaks was also undertaken. Even under
highly conservative parameters (1 percent of GAR under the 2009-10 outbreaks) that severely
underestimate the benefit estimations the economic returns to the AICP yielded 29 percent ERR
and an NPV of US$2.8 million. It confirms that from an economic point of view the project was
worth undertaking.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

3.4.1 Despite frequent implementation delays and disbursement lags, the project still achieved
its PDOs. There was a strong commitment on part of the GON and willingness to resolve critical
issues related to implementation. Overall outcomes are, thus, rated moderately satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

3.5.1 Although the project did not specifically focus on alleviating poverty, it generated
positive social impacts by reducing the threat to human health, raising HPAI awareness and
prevention practices, limiting poultry losses, and compensating for culled birds. Approximately
50 percent of rural households in Nepal have poultry in their backyard, and 30 percent of these
households belong to Dalits and Janajati, which are the most disadvantaged social groups in
Nepal.37 Moreover, backyard poultry is cared for primarily by women and children. Because nine
of 10 outbreaks affected backyard farmers,38 the project’s prevention and control activities, such
as surveillance, compensation, and communication, directly supported these vulnerable
households in safeguarding their livelihoods and source of protein. Women were involved in
verification of culled poultry during compensation. More than 18,805 farmers and animal health
workers in 26 high-risk districts were trained on participatory disease surveillance at village level.
UNICEF’s outreach to school children substantially contributed to increasing HPAI and general
influenza awareness and prevention at the household level.

                                                                                                           13
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

3.5.2 AICP built institutional capacities at DLS and DOHS in preventing and controlling HPAI
and other zoonotic disease outbreaks, such as H1N1. The project strengthened surveillance and
disease detection, diagnosis, response (containment or case management), quarantine, bio-
security, and communication. DLS still maintains the AICP structure to continue key prevention
activities, in particular, surveillance, and rapid response to HPAI outbreaks, which helped
contain the recent outbreak in November 2011. DLS also mainstreamed communication into the
Directorate of Extension Services and Training.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

3.6.1 Beneficiary survey. The end-line KAP surveys were undertaken by UNICEF in five CB-
SEP districts. The highlights of these surveys are as follows but also detailed in Annex 5:
     General HPAI awareness increased by 21 percent points to reach 82 percent (baseline
       was 61 percent). This exceeded the target of 80 percent.
     Almost 40 percent points more now children wash hands after touching birds (94 percent
       of respondents, compared to 55 percent at baseline).
     There was a 60 percent increase in knowledge on preventive measures in handling sick
       birds among adult family members.39

3.6.2 Stakeholder workshop. AICP organized a stakeholder workshop in June 2011. Key
lessons learned were as follows but also detailed in Annex 6:
     Communication is critical in preventing and controlling the spread of AI outbreaks.
       The project developed a communication package targeting the poultry farmers. In
       sustaining, DLS mainstreamed the communication activities under the Directorate of
       Extension and Training.
     Rapid response was facilitated by cross-sectoral cooperation at the district level.
       During containment, AICP enabled a high level of cooperation among media, local
       governments, CSOs (such as local political parties and youth associations), and the public
       health sector. The partnership with media was important to ensure transparency in
       providing the correct information to the general public.
     Compensation in cash and in-kind enhanced livelihoods of backyard farmers. The
       affected backyard farmers promptly received cash and later hybrid birds. However, the
       commercial farmers have not yet fully regained their stock. They took cash but not in-
       kind compensation or optional credit.
     The project had high-level support and ownership by MOAC. Throughout its
       implementation, the project had a high-level of ownership and support frm DLS as well
       as MOAC.

   There was a 56 percent points increase in reporting sick birds to veterinary office (80 percent at end-line, 24
percent at baseline), 58 percent points increase in separating sick and healthy birds (75 percent at end-line, 17
percent at baseline), and 71 percent points increase in not borrowing birds from infected areas (91 percent at end-
line, 20 percent at baseline).
                                                                                                                14
4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate

4.1     The institutional capacities built to prepare for, prevent, and control HPAI and other
zoonotic diseases are expected to be maintained by DLS and DOHS, which was demonstrated by
the additional budget allocation by the Government. DLS has a high level of commitment in
maintaining the AICP structure. GON is also highly committed, as reflected in the FY11/12
budgetary allocations to maintain key HPAI activities, such as surveillance and communication.
Although there is a concern whether DLS could maintain the same level of active and focused
surveillance in 26 high-risk districts, an effective surveillance model for HPAI and other
emerging zoonotic diseases would be developed by the proposed follow-on AHIF support. There
is also a risk whether the public health BSL2 laboratory at NPHL as well as isolation wards at
the NRH would be made fully operational in light of inadequate staffing. This, however, would
be followed up by the Nepal Health Sector Program (NHSP II, SWAp supported by IDA and
other partners).

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.1.1 The project design followed the GPAI, including the results framework and partnership
with UN agencies. Lessons learned from the on-going Bank-supported HPAI projects or those in
Nepal were incorporated, in particular, procurement and M&E. However, project design would
have been stronger if planned laboratory investments had been better aligned with local financial
and human resource capacities (i.e., if the scope of works was limited to BSL2 laboratories rather
than including two BSL3 laboratories). The results framework could have better captured all
aspects of the PDOs, and dedicated support for M&E activities during implementation would
have been desirable.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.1.2 AICP had a slow start-up. Much needed hand holding support in FM, procurement, and
safeguards was provided regularly by the Kathmandu-based Bank team throughout
implementation. The Bank team maintained a cross-sectoral technical team, including a
Kathmandu-based Public Health Specialist (for majority of the project life) and an animal health
specialist based in Australia, who closely monitored implementation through weekly audio
conference with DLS. However, because the Bank’s implementation support until MTR in July
2009 focused heavily on the cancellation of two BSL3 laboratories, QAG felt that there was not
adequate policy dialogue in long-term development of AI and zoonotic disease prevention and
control mechanisms. The quality of supervision was, thus, rated as “moderately unsatisfactory?
                                                                                               15
in August 2010 by QAG. Because the GON had a strong interest in these laboratories,
discussions related to cancellation of these labs created tension between GON and the Bank team.
Once the GON agreed to cancellation, the Bank team was able to intensify its focus on
strengthening poultry surveillance in all 26 high-risk districts and upgrading nine key national
and regional laboratories to BSL2. In the last 6 months of the project, with the departure of the
Kathmandu-based Public Health Specialist in end-2010, the Bank team ensured that
sustainability would be addressed in the Government’s Second HPN and HIV/AIDS Program.
The Bank team worked closely and effectively with other partners during implementation (WHO,
FAO, UNICEF, and USAID), and adopted a joint approach to supervision discussions. This
inclusive approach to program oversight facilitated project restructuring at mid-term.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.1.3 The overall Bank performance was moderately satisfactory. The discussions between
GON and the Bank team related to the construction of two BSL3 laboratories were time-
consuming but ultimately resulted in a desirable outcome from a cost-benefit perspective.
Although sustainability of BSL3 was flagged during the appraisal, cost benefit should have been
considered during the project design. However, as this was an emergency project that was
developed on the assumption of a potential global HPAI pandemic, cost benefit estimates at
appraisal might not have been relevant during implementation.

5.2 Recipient Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

5.2.1 The GON set up an inter-sectoral task force. By early-2006, a National Avian Influenza
and Influenza Pandemic Preparedness and Response Plan was prepared, and GON gave its
endorsement. Because HPAI became mildly endemic in Nepal, GON maintained a high level of
ownership and commitment in HPAI prevention and control, which was demonstrated by the
specific budget allocation for DLS, DOHS, and NHEICC for the current fiscal year.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.2.2 DLS had a high level of ownership in AICP. The Project Coordinator changed only once,
and the latest coordinator still remains in AICP’s structure that is maintained by DLS. DOHS, on
the other hand, had frequent turnover of the Project Coordinator but retained the Deputy Project
Coordinator throughout implementation. Although DLS and DOHS slowly built capacities in
project management, FM, procurement, and M&E, implementation was delayed frequently, in
particular, procurement, and procurement-related agreed actions were often not undertaken on a
timely basis. There was a high level of coordination among DLS, NHEICC, and UNICEF in
implementation of the communication component starting with the project launch. Such
coordination was also observed at the district level in responding to outbreaks, which engaged

                                                                                             16
both district DLS and DOHS in the DAITEC. At the national level, however, the primary
responsibility for coordination was with DLS and DOHS.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Recipient Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.2.3 AICP successfully contained 10 HPAI outbreaks, and the institutional mechanisms were
built to prevent and control HPAI and other zoonotic disease outbreaks at DLS and DOHS. DLS
is highly committed to maintain these mechanisms, which enabled rapid response to the recent
HPAI outbreak in November 2011. However, implementation of this emergency operation was
overall slower than expected, and the public health BSL2 and isolation wards at NRH were not
fully operational by time the project closed.

6. Lessons Learned

6.1       Key lessons learned from AICP are as follows:
         Investment in BSL3 should have been carefully considered at appraisal. Despite
          GON having a high interest in constructing two BSL3 laboratories, their sustainability,
          including cost benefit, should have been more carefully analyzed at appraisal. Such
          analysis should be undertaken when considering investment in highly sensitive as well as
          sophisticated infrastructure.
         Effective risk communication enabled rapid response. In containing HPAI outbreaks,
          AICP mobilized local CSOs, such as youth or political groups, to ensure transparency
          among backyard poultry farmers on culling and compensation. The project also managed
          media through local and national daily briefings during containment. This was also
          supported by training for media spokespersons. DLS highly values communication
          activities in enabling communication and prevention and has mainstreamed these
          activities in the Directorate of Extension Services and Training.
         High level of cooperation among DLS, NHEICC, and UNICEF ensured satisfactory
          implementation of the communication component. The three agencies set up a
          communication task force soon after the project became effective and worked closely in
          developing common prevention messages and focusing their delivery in 26 high-risk
          districts. As a result, HPAI awareness rate has increased from 61 to 82 percent.
         The KAP survey could be a strategic M&E tool. UNICEF undertook three KAP
          surveys during project implementation, which were complemented by annual mini-
          surveys. Although these surveys were centered on the CB-SEP, it was a good practice to
          regularly obtain feedback from target populations.
         Close collaboration with UN and donor technical agencies strengthened the
          institutional capacities in disease prevention and control. The project worked closely
          with technical agencies (including FAO, WHO, UNICEF), and with other development
          partners (USAID) in developing a response plan, enhancing preparedness, and building
          capacities in disease surveillance, diagnosis, response (containment or case management),
          and communication. Joint supervision with USAID enhanced coordination of planned
          project activities between the IDA-supported AICP and the USAID-supported H2P.
         Engagement of UN agencies should have been facilitated prior to GPAI
          implementation. Even though it took only two weeks to declare the project
          effectiveness, it took about a year to contract UN partners since then. This led to delay in
                                                                                                   17
       initial start-up and implementation of key activities. Issues such as overhead cost, audit
       requirement, and contracting processes should have been addressed between the Bank
       and these agencies at headquarter levels, prior to the GPAI implementation at the level of
       individual countries. This should be noted for future projects with heavy UN agency
       involvement.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Recipient/Implementing Agencies/Partners

7.1     The Bank distributed the draft ICR to the GON as well as concerned partners based in
Nepal. The comments that were received indicated that the draft ICR was acceptable and there
were no specific comments. Overall, as far as the contribution of this project is concerned, the
response of the recipient, implementing agencies and partners was positive and favorable. With
the support of this project, GON officials felt that they were not only able to control 10 HPAI
outbreaks but were also able to strengthen institutional capacity. The Recipient was more
generous with its ratings for both the Recipient as well as the Bank and rated their performances
as satisfactory. GON was very keen to finance two BSL-3 laboratories in Nepal through this
project but was unable to achieve this goal. Given the complexity, long time involved and
substantial resources needed, authorities did realize that this project was not in a position to
finance the establishment of two BSL-3 laboratories before the project closed. The Recipient is
pleased that there is a good possibility for Bank financing a follow-up project that will focus on
zoonotic disease prevention and control, which would be financed through a grant from the Trust
Fund dealing with HPAI.

Component A. Animal Health
This component directly contributed to achieving PDOs by: (i) developing an institutional
capacity in HPAI surveillance (prevention), (ii) developing five SOPs in stamping- out operation,
surveillance, quarantine, laboratory control, and waste management, and reviewing three legal
frameworks to enable prevention and control activities (preparedness and planning); and (iii)
strengthening DLS capacities in diagnosis and quarantine at central and regional levels,
successfully containing 10 HPAI outbreaks in poultry birds, and providing compensation to
affected farmers without any delays (response and containment).

Sub-component A.1 Surveillance. This sub-component developed a national random sero-
sampling program and collected 50,000 samples from both commercial and backyard poultry
                                                                                    23
farms in almost four-and-a-half years of project implementation. This was almost 80 percent
more than the planned 28,000 samples. The surveillance activities were focused in all 26 high-
risk districts by building institutional as well as grass-roots capacities at regional, district, and
village levels. More than five thousand one hundred and thirty seven veterinary professionals,
para-vets, poultry owners, and wildlife technicians were trained on HPAI prevention and control
and bio-security. This exceeded the original target of 3,600 persons by 43 percent. Likewise,
about 18,800 villagers were trained in participatory disease surveillance, which also exceeded the
original target of 16,000 persons by 18 percent. At the district level, 332 surveyors were trained
on intensive surveillance (10 surveyors per high-risk district and four surveyors per medium-risk
DITs and an additional 6 mobile surveillance supervision teams. These 12 teams were attached
to five regional directorates and DAH in Kathmandu.

Sub-component A.2 Prevention and Containment. Because nine out of 10 HPAI outbreaks in
Nepal seemed to have originated from poultry trades with India, it was critical to strengthen
quarantine offices.47 All nine quarantine offices (one central and eight regional48). The project
expanded physical facilities of all quarantine offices by providing 8 pick-ups, 22 motorbikes, 7
computers, 23 fridges, 2 deep freezers, 33 fumigation pumps and surveillance kits. These
facilities, in particular transportation, were originally envisaged for 24 quarantine check-posts at
border to strengthen decentralized surveillance and detection. However, they were kept mostly at
quarantine offices or District Livestock Service Offices, particularly pick-ups and motorbikes,
because of overall lack of transportation facilities at the regional and district levels.

The prevention and containment mechanism was proven successful, as the project contained 10
HPAI outbreaks in poultry birds. It was also tested by eight simulation exercises in collaboration
with USAID and FAO (two exercises were financed by AICP). The project also organized two
quarantine workshops in Jhapa and Kathmandu. Poultry farmers, traders, livestock officers,
public health officers, and other government officers, such as customs, quarantine, and police
participated in these workshops. The Indian quarantine officers also participated in the workshop
in Jhapa.

Sub-component A.3 Laboratory Capacity. The project enhanced CVL to achieve 90 percent
consistency in rapid test results with OIE reference laboratory by mid-2009. AICP also
strengthened diagnostic capacities by upgrading all eight veterinary laboratories to BSL2,
including CVL, which was originally to be upgraded to BSL3 (cancelled at restructuring). Thirty
two laboratory specialists (15 veterinary laboratory scientists and 17 technicians) were trained.

Sub-component A.4 Field Veterinary Services. This sub-component trained one RRT per district
for all 75 districts in Nepal on containment, including culling, safe disposal, and stamping out. In
addition, 150 RRTs were also trained in stamping-out operations. The establishment of a vaccine

   During the HPAI outbreaks in Pokhara (Kaski district in Central Nepal) in January 2010, the RVL (in Pokhara)
detected at least two strains: one was sub-clade 2.2, which originated in India or Bangladesh, and another was clade
2.3.2, which was transmitted by migratory birds (the same strain detected in China, Vietnam, and Japan). See the
attached link for more information on clades. http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/15/3/08-1190-f1.htm
48
   The eight regional quarantine offices are located in Nepalgunj, Bhairahawa, Krishna Nagar, Biratnagar, Rani,
Birjung, Sirciya, and Birgang Jeetpir, and each office oversees two to three districts.
                                                                                                                 24
bank was planned but the idea was dropped in July 2009 as a result of the technical committee
decision.

Sub-component A.5 Compensation fund. The SOP for compensation was developed in January
2007. The rate was set at NRS 100 per poultry (irrespective of age), NRS 0.5 per egg, and NRS 5
per kg of feed. The flat rate for all birds was to facilitate prompt payment, within five days for
backyard farmers and 35 days for commercial farmers.49 The compensation rate, however, had to
be revised during the first outbreaks in Jhapa in January 2009. Although the backyard farmers
accepted this rate, commercial farmers considered it too low and refused for their flocks to be
culled. The rate was, therefore, revised. For the backyard farmers, the project also provided in-
kind hybrid chicks. After the outbreak in Pokhara in February 2010, the flat rate had to be
revised, because high-value Muscovy ducks were also affected. The farm gate price was NRS
1,050 per duck, which was 63 percent more than a layer (NRS 650 per bird) and three times
more than a backyard flock (NRS 335 per bird). The revised rates were: NRS 130 per chicken
(backyard or broiler), duck, or pigeon; NRS 100 per kg of poultry meat; NRS 50 per chick
(backyard or broiler); NRS 10 per kg of feed; and NRS 3 per egg. Despite the Bank
recommendation to increase the compensation rate for the ducks to give farmers more incentive
in disease reporting, the GON maintained the flat rate to keep the compensation funds at a
moderate level.

In the stamping-out operations to contain 10 HPAI outbreaks, the project destroyed 28,115
poultry, 886 Muscovy ducks, 346 pigeons, 4,512 eggs, 114 kg bird feeds, and 148.5 kg meat.
The compensation amounted to NRS 2,912,260 (approximately, US$41,000). For the backyard
farmers, the compensation was paid without any delay as it was mostly done by RRT
immediately after culling. The affected backyard farmers benefited from the in-kind
compensation of hybrid poultry, because they doubled their income from sales of eggs and meat
following the HPAI outbreak. A concessional credit was to be provided to commercial farmers
for restocking. However, the compensation mechanism did not have accountability measures in
place such as farm registration, disclosure or grievance redressal system.

Component B. Human Health
This component directly contributed in achieving PDOs by: (i) enhancing HPAI surveillance and
diagnostic capacities (prevention), (ii) developing six guidelines which were tested during the
H1N1 pandemic in 2009/2010 and updated (preparedness and planning); and (iii) strengthening
DOHS capacities in rapid response at the central and regional levels (response and containment).

Sub-component B.1 Surveillance and Laboratory Strengthening. This sub-component developed
six guidelines on surveillance, laboratory, infection control, clinical case management,
community/home based case management, and risk communication. These guidelines were
tested during the H1N1 pandemic (end-2009 to early-2010)50 and revised in October 2010. AICP
set up human health RRTs, and 423 public health workers were trained on the surveillance


49
   DLS proposed to use the market rate, ranging between 50 and 100 percent of such price depending on the type of
birds. The use of market rate appeared problematic in determining the date to fix the price, when the price of poultry
meat and eggs continued to drop due to HPAI outbreaks in India and Pakistan in mid-2006. The flat rate follows the
India model.
50
   According to WHO, about 220 people were infected by H1N1, but only two died.
                                                                                                                  25
guideline, which exceeded the target of 250 workers by 70 percent. Seventy five workers are also
trained on the use of rapid diagnostic kits.

In collaboration with WHO, DOHS enhanced the EWARS by establishing seven additional sites
(out of 8 planned). EWARS now operates at a total of 35 sites, and 32 sites regularly submit
surveillance reports on ILI and Severe Acute Respiratory Illness (SARI).

The NPHL was strengthened and designated as the NIC. The test results were 100 percent
consistent with the WHO reference laboratory.51 The planned construction of public health BSL3
was cancelled at restructuring of March 5, 2010, but NPHL was upgraded to BSL2 and validated.
However, due to insufficient staffing, the O&M training was not carried out during
implementation. The LIMS was also upgraded.

Sub-component B.2 Prevention and Containment. This sub-component procured 3,000 PPEs and
anti-viral as planned. Because these were used during the H1N1 pandemic, an additional 2,000
were procured to replenish the stock. Instead of setting up eight permanent quarantine facilities
at major airport and border entry points (land routes), the project established 12 travel advisory
health desks during the H1N1 pandemic. A total of 337,563 travelers were screened and 39
suspected cases were identified. It also prepared the Communicable Disease Control Act for
which MOHP approval was awaited.

Sub-component B.3 Health Care Delivery System Preparedness and Response. DOHS provided
non-pharmaceutical intervention plans to all 75 districts, and 18 districts (24 percent) prepared
their own plans with assistance from USAID-supported Humanitarian Pandemic Preparedness
(H2P) Project.

STIDH was designated as the NRH. The subcomponent supported establishment of 13 isolation
wards and five intensive care units at national and regional response centers and provided
equipment to strengthen response capacities. Moderately high cost isolation wards were
established at STIDH and three other referral hospitals in Kathmandu (B.P. Koirala Institute of
Health Sciences), Bharatpur, and Nepalganj. However, two facilities (STIDH and Nepalganj)
were not made fully operational, due to inadequate staffing. The sub-component also established
least-cost isolation wards at nine public health facilities in Mechi, Koshi, Janakpur, Narayani,
Chitwan, Lumbini, Bheri, Seti and Mahakali districts.

Component C. Communication
This component directly contributed in achieving PDOs by: (i) increasing the level of HPAI
awareness by about 30 percentage points to achieve an 82 percent awareness rate (awareness),
(ii) developing an HPAI communication strategy (preparedness and planning); and (iii)
developing a risk communication model during stamping-out operations (response and
containment).

Sub-component C.1 Animal Health. This sub-component far exceeded the planned level of
communication outreach. Because it was managed by DLS, these activities adequately supported


51
     In FY 2011/2012, NPHL will participate in the external quality assurance scheme (EQUAS).
                                                                                                26
containment at the farm level and focused on all 26 high-risk districts. The sub-component
trained 3,300 community stakeholders (poultry farmers, including women), 81 percent more than
originally planned. Prevention messages were aired on one national TV and 26 local FM stations
in 26 high-risk districts52 and printed in newspaper 660 times. Approximately, 400,000 posters
(which far exceeded the estimate of 20,000) and brochures and 1,600 communication toolkits
were printed and distributed. About 278 traders and farmers in high risk districts were also
trained on quarantine and bio-security.

Based on the lessons learned in managing stamping-out operations, the subcomponent trained
750 media spokespersons on risk communication and disease prevention, which was 3.3 times
more than originally planned (225 persons). Likewise, 1,425 security personnel were trained on
disease prevention and bio-security, which was 5.7 times more than planned (250 officers). This
ensured delivery of correct AI information and prevention messages to affected communities.
Although not quantified, AICP also mobilized CSOs in facilitating rapid culling operations
(including youth organizations, farmers associations, and political parties). DLS was convinced
of the importance of communication, and, has mainstreamed these activities in the Directorate of
Extension Services and Training (DEST).

Sub-component C.2 Human Health. This sub-component developed the HPAI communication
strategy, which was endorsed by both MOAC and MOPH in June 2010. Communication
guidelines and protocols were also developed in September 2010 and approved by the two
ministries in February 2011. UNICEF’s CB-SEP was implemented in eight high-risk districts,
which were Ilam, Jhapa, Sunsari, Morang, Saptari, Chitwan, Nawalparashi, and Banke (AICP
financed the program in five districts). CB-SEP trained 180,000 students at 3,000 schools in
these districts. UNICEF also mobilized 64 CSOs of women, micro-credit, local ethnic groups,
para-legal and/or youth (eight organizations per district) and formed DDCs. About 800
committee members were trained in hand washing, AI prevention, and risk communication.

Component D. Project Management
DLS reviewed and revised three regulatory frameworks in providing overall framework and
justification in response and containment activities, including stamping out and compensation:
Veterinary Council Act, Animal Health and Livestock Service Act 1998, and Bird Flu Control
Order 2007. The Bird Flu Control Order was issued under the Natural Disaster Relief Act 1982
and revised to incorporate lessons learned from the first HPAI outbreak in January 2009. DLS
also developed five SOPs. The EMP, including waste management, was developed in July 2006,
while the other four SOPs were developed by 2008: containment (revised in 2010), surveillance
guidelines (revised in 2009), quarantine guidelines, and laboratory protocol. A total of 32 project
staff at DLS and DOHS was trained on project management.

   Nepal has 46 national radio stations, more than 75 FM radio stations (at least one per district), and approximately
17 community radio stations. The radio ownership ranges from 44 to 62 percent, and the listenership is estimated at
64 percent in urban and 50 percent in rural populations. On the other hand, the TV ownership is as low as 20 percent
in urban and 1 percent in rural populations.
                                                                                                                   27
                          Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

1.      Several donor-supported projects were initiated in Nepal as a result of H5N1 outbreaks in
the region, since late 2003 outbreaks in South East Asia, including more recently Bangladesh and
India. With 24 million chickens and 0.4 million ducks, the Nepalese poultry sector today
contributes nearly 3.1 percent to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and is critical for livelihood of
millions of rural households. About 70 percent of the poultry business is organized under
commercial farms employing more than 65,000 persons. It constitutes a significant source of
income for the rural poor in Nepal. Productivity in the backyard chicken market is very high,
particularly in the Terai, Siwalik Hills and deep valleys of mid-hills.

2.     Due to the risk posed over the poultry industry and especially over the public health,
GON developed a strategic plan in 2006 – the NAIIPPRP – and an operational plan, based on
which the US$18.2 million equivalent IDA-assisted AICP was approved. In addition to the AICP,
FAO/USAID spent US$1.4 million since 2006; UNICEF spent US$550,000 on AI
communications (with US$150,000 from Japan, US$100,000 from DFID and US$300,000 from
Canada); and USAID spent about US$200,000 through international non-government
organizations (NGOs), investing also on in-kind PPEs to support AI control on human health
aspects.

3.       While complemented by the achievements from other projects, AICP was instrumental in
consolidating and strengthening the country’s successful preparedness to contain HPAI
outbreaks. This annex outlines and identifies the benefits and costs of these efforts, and presents
an economic analysis relating these costs to the most direct benefits identified from project
activities targeted at human health and at poultry issues (in terms of economic value loss
avoidance). An economic and financial analysis of AICP was not undertaken during project
preparation or restructuring of the project.

Project Costs

4.      At project closure, AICP costs were about US$14 million from IDA. With parallel
projects spending about US$2.2 million, total investments related to AI preparedness and control
in Nepal were about US$16 million. GON incremental recurrent costs beyond 2012 were
estimated at US$500,000 per year for incremental salaries, materials, and other O&M costs.
These investment costs were compared with the value of some quantifiable benefits to assess if
the investments were justified and the results are provided below.

Project Benefits

5.     Benefits were derived from the development of the project’s pandemic preparedness and
continued vigilance for heath security, sustained people’s livelihood, and ultimately economic
development. For quantifying these benefits two scenarios were considered (“With? and
“Without? Project) in order to measure, from the difference between scenarios, the loss
avoidance and costs related to the damages from the disease.

6.     Poultry Sector Project Benefits. With about 22 million poultry in Nepal in 2010 and
more than 70 percent of poultry in large commercial enterprises producing meat and eggs, the
                                                                                                28
project’s impact on the poultry industry was a significant decrease in the number of poultry
infected and/or culled during the HPAI outbreaks and thus, the number of poultry deaths. Losses
avoided included: (i) the value of poultry meat production losses avoided; and (ii) the economic
value of egg production loss avoidance plus the value of the layer birds at the end of their
productive life. Average value of live bird farm gate price of NRS 255 was used, multiplied by
the number of broiler deaths averted, assuming that 50 percent of chicken deaths would be
broilers. An average 154 eggs/bird/year, multiplied by the farm gate egg price of NRS 0.80/egg
and the number of layer deaths avoided, assuming that 50 percent of deaths are layer hens, plus
the meat value of a layer hen at the end of her productive life (set at 50 percent the value of a
broiler) multiplied by number of layer deaths avoided (assuming that 50 percent of chicken
deaths are layers) allowed for estimating the project benefits.

7.       The avoidance of the cost of culling and replacement programs under both scenarios was
also included resulting in an additional benefit. At the time of the 2010 outbreak, the GON
compensation per bird was NRS 100 per bird for losses, which represented only 17.8 percent of
the average cost for SOP application in the ten Nepalese outbreak sites occurring in 2009 and
2010. From the calculation of the ten situations with varied poultry population, the average
cost of stamping out one bird was around NRS 680 and the percentage share of the different
activities involved were; hired transport 11.3 percent, cost of equipment and drugs 31.2 percent,
salary and wages 31.5 percent, compensation to farmers 17.8 percent and contingency 7.6
percent. Based on these costs, for the present analysis, SOP cost of US$10 was considered for
the culling and associated costs. Project results based on these assumptions are presented below.

8.      Human Health Project Benefits were not quantified although the project has also a
significant impact by preventing, until now, the spread of the disease; and in the future, by
potentially decreasing (or hopefully completely avoiding) the percentage of the human
population infected by HPAI. Losses avoided would result in this case, from reducing the
number of hospitalizations and the number of deaths attributed to HPAI53. Benefits could thus
be also expressed in terms of loss avoidance, and include the economic value of: (i)
hospitalization costs averted, (ii) avoidance of income loss from days lost due to illness, and (iii)
income loss avoidance from fatal HPAI cases (average value of remaining lifetime earnings
expressed as the present value of annual take-home income over an average 15 years discounted
at 12 percent). Another major unquantifiable project benefit is that the program put in place - in
response to the HPAI project - a strengthened country’s preparedness program to respond not
only to future outbreaks of HPAI outbreaks, but also of other zoonoses and highly infectious
diseases, especially through the implemented communications and awareness programs, as well
as the training and capacity building. This was demonstrated during the H1N1 outbreak in 2009




53
  The affected human population (Gross Attack Rate) for an outbreak of HPAI could be estimated at a percentage of
the population being hospitalized and a percentage of death for those affected both under the “Without Project? and
the “WithProject? scenarios. However, these parameters are difficult to estimate, and it was not possible to obtain
practitioners to provide estimates because of inadequate and incomplete statistical data and information to base their
estimates. For the economic analysis, the economic value of human health losses avoided was therefore not
considered.
                                                                                                                   29
and 2010 to which the general population as well as the medical specialists reacted very calmly
because the health system had the experience, information and means to cope with the situation 54.

9.      Other Possible Non-quantified Benefits are (i) an avoidance of a decrease in GDP
growth; (ii) the avoidance of an increase in foreign exchange requirements for imports of poultry
meat and eggs (and possibly other substitute food products) during the crisis period; and (iii) the
avoidance of economic losses to consumers because of price increases (cross-price elasticity
effects) for other livestock products. These were not analyzed because of data constraints.
However, the effects in terms of economic losses are likely to be very high due the importance of
tourism in the Nepalese economy.

10.     The scenarios for the analysis:
       Under the “With Project situation? the infection rate during the 2009-2010 outbreaks
GAR of HPAI resulted in about 0.3 percent of the poultry population infected and/or culled
because the project had been adequately implemented and a preparedness system was in place,
and worked properly. On this base, this scenario assumed that GAR would affect 0.3 percent of
the poultry population every year, but its spread would be contained and controlled as was the
case in the 2009-2010 outbreaks55.
       In the “Without Project scenario? it was assumed that the 2009-2010 outbreaks would
have had a huge level of infection that could have resulted in an infected/culled rate of 17
percent of the poultry population with 100 percent mortality of the birds involved. These
estimates are based on what actually happened during the 2003-2004 outbreaks in Vietnam -
with no preparation – where about 45 million birds (17 percent of about 265 million) either died
from HPAI or were culled56. Although not every bird culled might be infected by HPAI, the
recommended practice is to slaughter all birds in a flock or village where an outbreak is
confirmed. For purposes of analysis, thus, all birds culled are deemed to have been infected and
killed as a result of the HPAI outbreak.




54
   The awareness campaign through TV and radio targeted high risk districts at border areas, and a Trans-border
Workshop for quarantine and security officers was conducted at the Nepal-India border.
55
   The mortality rate remains 100% for the infected birds: the project did reduce the number of poultry deemed to be
infected because of the improved diagnostic and detection capacity and the ability to contain outbreaks, but it may
not decrease the mortality rate once a flock is infected. For now, Nepal appears to be holding bird flu at bay, but no
one can assure it will stay that way. The control measures help, but illegal poultry trade poses a risk of
reintroduction of the virus.
56
   There have been three main waves of outbreaks in Vietnamese poultry since late 2003, with 93 confirmed human
cases and 42 deaths: (i) from December 2003-March 2004, 45 million poultry were culled and 27 human cases were
reported, 16 of which were fatal. At the peak of the epidemic in early 2004, around 24 percent of Vietnam's
communes and 60 percent of towns were affected, in 57 out of Vietnam's 64 provinces. Seventeen percent of the
poultry population died or were culled. Scattered outbreaks and a small number of human cases continued through
November 2004; (ii) from December 2004 to March 2005, 2 million poultry were culled and 64 human cases (21of
which were fatal); (iii) from October to December 2005, 4 million poultry were culled and 2 human cases were
reported. Around 8 million of Viet Nam's 11 million households were estimated to be engaged in poultry production
prior to 2003. It is estimated that the direct economic impact of HPAI amounted to about 0.12 percent of Vietnam’s
GDP in 2004 alone, representing the net effect of the negative impacts on the poultry sector compensated to some
extent by the increase in substitute livestock production. The total cost of the epidemic in the first two years has
been estimated to be around US$630 million.
                                                                                                                   30
11.     The “With Project? scenario estimates that 0.3 percent of the poultry population could be
infected every year and would die from HPAI or be destroyed by GON order, while “Without
Project? it was assumed that – as in the case of Vietnam – 17 percent of the birds would have
been culled after the 2009-2010 outbreaks. It was also assumed that without the project, after the
outbreaks the GON would have then reacted by implementing an AICP starting in 2010. For the
analysis, the value of poultry losses avoided was calculated with the assumption that an HPAI
outbreaks would occur every year from 2009 onwards, mainly due to illegal imported birds,
using the above mentioned GAR and other parameters. These parameters are considered as likely
during a severe outbreak of HPAI in the poultry industry, as happened in Vietnam without
project in 2004-2006.

Economic Rate of Return and Sensitivity Analysis
12.     The analysis related AICP costs to the benefits from the economic value stream of losses
avoided from project activities in the poultry industry - expressed as the expected value of the
economic loss avoided from outbreaks in a 7-year period (2008-2014). Project benefits are
assumed to remain realizable over the period and beyond, attributable to the project expenditures
on laboratories, equipment and awareness programs and the increase in human capital from the
project’s training activities. The market prices used for poultry products are considered to be
economic prices, because the markets, for the most part, operate freely without production quotas
and subsidies for poultry or poultry inputs. Wages and other market prices used in the analysis
are also assumed to be economic prices. Under the “Without Project? scenario it was assumed
that after the 2009-2010 outbreaks - with about 17 percent of the poultry population being lost -
the GON would have immediately implemented an AICP to contain further outbreaks.
Consequently, by 2014 after its completion the “with? and “without? situation would become the
same in terms of preparedness, control and results.

13.     Table 1 below presents the project’s costs, benefits and results of the economic analysis
based on the above assumptions and parameters for the poultry sector losses avoided. The
results are highly robust, with a 311 percent ERR and NPV of US$34.8 million. The results did
not quantify the human health benefits, the economic value of human health and life loss
avoidance.

14.     A sensitivity analysis concerning the GAR in the poultry sector in the “Without Project?
situation during the 2009-2010 outbreaks was undertaken, and results are shown below. The
economic returns to the AICP are highly robust, even under highly conservative parameters (1
percent of GAR under the 2009-2010 outbreaks) that severely restrict the benefit estimations. It
clearly confirms that from an economic point of view, project was worth undertaking.

                          Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

1.      The KAP survey was conducted in early-2011 in selected five high-risk districts
(Ilam, Jhapa, Morang, Sunsari, and Chitwan), where UNICEF implemented the CB-SEP.
Almost 770 families participated in a household survey, including 3,070 school children,
in both intervention and non-intervention Village Development Committees (VDCs). In
addition, 200 students, teachers, poultry farmers, village leaders, health workers, social
workers, and political leaders participated in 20 focus group discussions at district and
village levels. The survey was conducted by UNICEF, in collaboration with the NHEICC
under the MOHP.

2.     School children. Almost all children in the intervention and non-intervention
VDCs reported that they washed their hands regularly (99.3 percent in non-intervention
and 99.4 percent in intervention areas). While only 16.2 percent of respondents in the
intervention areas washed their hands after sneezing at baseline, 93.5 percent of them did
so at end of the project. In the intervention areas, more children washed hands after
touching birds, from 55.4 percent at baseline to 94.2 percent at the end of the project.

3.      The children in the intervention VDCs are more knowledgeable of the signs and
symptoms of pandemic influenza: 86.6 percent indicated coughing; 86.6 percent
indicated sore throat; and 89.1 percent indicated fever. In the non-intervention areas, 51.0
percent responded coughing, 16.3 percent did sore throat, and 83.7 percent did fever.

4.     Similarly the knowledge of 4 major prevention methods of pandemic influenza is
also increased among the children across the districts. The study showed that the
percentage of respondents who could identify the 4 major prevention methods of
pandemic influenza from the non-intervention VDCs were, covering nose and mouth
while sneezing and coughing (23.2 percent), one meter distance from sick person (15.2
percent), use of mask (33.3 percent) and washing hands with soap and water (11.1
percent). The children from the intervention mentioned the 4 key preventive measures
were covering nose and mouth while sneezing and coughing (92.6 percent), one meter
distance from sick person (88.2 percent), use of mask (89.0 percent) and washing hands
with soap and water (81.6 percent). The hand washing, use of mask, avoiding crowd and
coughing messages was key massage during intervention and led to improvement in
knowledge about key indicators among intervention area.

5.     The survey describes the source of information on bird flu and revealed that 47.5
percent respondents from non-intervention VDC and 49.2 percent respondents from
intervention VDC received information about bird flu on the radio while 66.2 percent
respondents form non-intervention VDC and 78.4 percent respondents from intervention
VDC received information from TV. Similarly 22.7 percent from non-intervention VDC
and 29 percent from intervention VDC received information from health workers.
Similarly, reading materials were also found to be a source of information for children
since more than 40 percent of the children mentioned that books are also one of the major
sources of information for them in both intervention and non-intervention VDCs. Further,

                                                                                         35
teachers, health worker and family members also mentioned children as a source of
information. As part of the media habit, the children were also asked about language in
terms of easy to read, write and understand. The majority of the children both from non-
intervention and intervention VDCs mentioned Nepali (86.6 percent non-intervention and
92.7 percent in intervention VDCs) on any issues. This was followed by Maithili and
Tharu, which can also be used in some parts of the districts to reach hard to reach
communities.

6.     Household members. The hand washing knowledge and practice among the
farmers is 100 percent in both the non-intervention and intervention VDCs. Similarly the
hand washing practice after touching poultry was also about 44.0 percent and 90.0
percent in non-intervention and intervention VDC respectively.

7.      The knowledge of backyard farmer and their families on 3 key measures to
prevent bird flu was high in intervention VDCs. Only about 20 percent of farmers among
non-intervention VDC and 80 percent of farmers among intervention VDC report to a
veterinary doctor or call them if chickens get sick. Nearly 27.1 percent of farmers from
non-intervention VDC and 75 percent of farmers among intervention VDC separate sick
and healthy birds. Almost 33 percent of farmers from non-intervention VDC and 91.2
percent from intervention VDC stated that bird flu can be prevented by discouraging
illegal importation and movement through restriction of entry of sick birds from the
infected area. The knowledge on three major sign and symptoms was also relatively low
among families. Regarding the knowledge of signs and symptoms of pandemic influenza,
coughing (17.8 percent), fever (31.5 percent), and sore throat (15.1 percent) were
considered signs and symptoms of pandemic influenza among backyard farmer families
in non-intervention VDC. However, in intervention VDC, coughing by (92.5 percent),
fever (91.2 percent), and sore throat (87.5 percent) were considered signs and symptoms
of pandemic influenza.

8.     The majority of farmers stated that covering the face while coughing and sneezing
(17.8 percent in non-intervention VDC and 84.8 percent in intervention VDC) and use of
mask (45.2 percent in non-intervention VDC and 79.7 percent in intervention VDC) can
prevent pandemic influenza. Regarding the social measures to control pandemic
influenza, about 17.8 percent of farmers from non-intervention VDC and 82.3 percent of
farmers from intervention VDC stated that by avoiding crowding can prevent epidemic of
pandemic influenza. The four measures to prevent pandemic influenza must be a priority
for the communication intervention to educate the families on pandemic influenza. In
both intervention and non-intervention VDCs the information is inadequate for the
families on pandemic influenza.

                Annex 6. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results

DLS organized a Stakeholder Workshop in June 2011. About 100 people participated in
the workshop, including MOAC representatives, DLS Officers, poultry associations,
FAO and the World Bank. Summary of discussion, including lessons learned, was as
follows:

      The participants congratulated the project’s achievements in successfully
       containing 10 AI outbreaks in poultry.
      Communication is critical in preventing and controlling the spread of AI
       outbreaks. The project developed a communication package targeting poultry
       farmers. In controlling future outbreaks, DLS mainstreamed the communication
       activities under the training and extension directorate.
      Rapid response was facilitated by cross-sectoral cooperation at the district level.
       There was a high level of cooperation among media, local governments, CSOs
       (such as local political parties and youth associations), and the public health
       sector in stamping out operations. The partnership with media, in particular,
       ensured transparency by providing the correct information.
      Compensation in cash and in-kind enhanced livelihoods of backyard farmers. The
       affected backyard farmers promptly received cash and later hybrid birds. As a
       result, these farmers almost doubled their income with the sales of eggs and meat.
       However, the commercial farmers have not yet fully regained their stock. They
       took cash but not in-kind compensation.
      The project had high level support and ownership from MOAC and DLS
       throughout project implementation.
      It was suggested that MOAC strengthen: (i) diagnostic capacity by establishing
       BSL3, (ii) bio-security at commercial farms, (iii) risk communication, and (iv)
       epidemiology.

                        Annex 7. Summary of Recipient's ICR

1.     With the arrival of highly pathogenic HPAI in neighboring countries, India and
China in 2006, the threat to Nepal significantly increased, as the country shares a long
and porous border with these countries. In early 2006 the GON endorsed NAHIPPP,
which was a joint human and animal health plan providing a strategic framework to
prepare for and respond to this threat. As a results, an implementation plan was
developed to enhance animal and human health, and communication. The GON requested
the support of the World Bank (IDA) to finance AICP to be implemented over a four-
year period from FY2007/2008 to FY2010/2011 at an estimated cost of US$18.20 million
or NRS 1.33 billion.

2.      The overall objective of AICP was to minimize the threat posed by HPAI in
Nepal by: (i) controlling such infections among birds, especially domestic poultry and (ii)
preparing for, controlling, and responding to possible human infections, especially an
influenza epidemic and related emergencies. AICP envisaged three types of
interventions: (i) prevention, (ii) preparedness and planning, and (iii) response and
containment in case of AI outbreaks. The projects closed on July 31, 2011 in all its four
components: (i) Animal Health; (ii) Human Health; (iii) cross-cutting communication and
(iii) Implementation Support and Monitoring and Evaluation.

3.     Implementation. The GON also requested FAO to assist in the implementation
of the animal health component of the project by providing technical assistance and
equipment provision under an agreement which covered the period from August 2008 to
July 2011. FAO’s technical assistance focused on the following sub-sectors of AICP
program:
         Design and monitoring of construction of a BSL3;
         Surveillance and epidemiological investigation;
         Strengthening of animal quarantine services;
         Strengthening of the capacity of veterinary laboratory work;
         Strengthening of veterinary field services; and
         Project management

4.     Although the design for the BSL3 laboratory was produced but this component of
AICP program was dropped on the recommendation of a World Bank MTR.
Consequently, the project concentrated on enhancing bio-safety and technical capacity at
CVL and regional laboratories. This was facilitated through an extensive program of
technical assistance inputs, capacity building and specialized equipment provision. CVL
is now fully capable of a wide and detailed range of HPAI diagnostic techniques,
including molecular virology and virus sequencing.

5.      The capability of the veterinary epidemiological centre has been expanded
through the introduction of tools that facilitate animal disease data management (TAD
info) and visualizing data through mapping (GIS) combined with Information
Technology (IT) hardware and software provision. Risk analysis has been conducted and
active surveillance for HPAI developed through a targeted disease searching process.

                                                                                        38
6.      Communications have been supported through technical assistance leading to
improved awareness of HPAI among poultry farmers with the aim of improving passive
surveillance through reporting of disease by owners. The cross-cutting communication
component was implemented by UNICEF on a tripartite agreement between the DOHS
under MOHP, and DLS under MOAC is a part of the AICP in both the Human Health
and Animal Health Component of the project.

7.      The GON rates the project outcome satisfactory, but the risk to development
outcome is significant. The Bank and GON performance was both rated satisfactory. The
project achieved the following:
     AICP has been the major player in supporting GON’s activities preparing for and
        counteracting the incursion of AI into Nepal. The Animal Health component has
        been actively and substantially supported by the sub-project covered by the
        agreement between FAO and GON.
     The processes established through AICP to develop and strengthen the capability
        of DLS in preventing, detecting, diagnosing, containing and eliminating HPAI
        should be preserved and further developed to encompass other trans-boundary
        diseases and emerging infectious diseases, and particularly those with zoonotic
        potential and thus broaden the approach to sustainable animal health systems.
     Through training and equipment provision, GON has been provided with many of
        the tools required to further advance epidemiology and surveillance under DOH.
        This has included the introduction of TAD info software package to improve
        DLS’s ability to manage data gathered on livestock diseases more efficiently.
        Departmental willingness to adopt the system more widely and to integrate the
        system currently used for OIE data reporting could be stronger and further
        advocacy in this area is indicated. GIS training also emphasized integration with
        TAD info and VEC’s capability has been strengthened through upgraded
        software, computer and UPS provision and the supply of a color printer, digital
        maps of 74 districts and 6 GPS handsets. It should be noted that, with advances in
        the understanding of the epidemiology of the viruses concerned, the
        recommended approach to HPAI surveillance has also progressed and for that
        reason the project has moved towards developing a scientifically based disease
        searching approach to active surveillance and discouraged the collection of serum
        samples from healthy chickens.
     FAO has fully played its part in analyzing the effectiveness of border controls to
        prevent entry of HPAI, and has advocated modifying the present strategy towards
        one which more readily accepts the realities and encourages cross-border
        cooperation and communication together with engagement with relevant
        stakeholders and traders. Although reliance on physical border control was
        emphasized in the project agreement with FAO, this is unrealistic and the current
        scientific opinion supports risk analysis and management through cross border
        cooperation between relevant authorities, including traders and producers, and
        acceptance that with a long porous and un-patrolled border alternative strategies
        have to be explored.


                                                                                       39
      AICP’s interactions in the area of laboratory services has been massive and has
       resulted in increased competence and improved confidence in the diagnostic
       capacity of CVL and RVLs. However, more needs to be done in the areas of
       laboratory equipment maintenance, the management and procurement of
       consumables for both HPAI diagnostics and differential diagnostic needs. The
       regional laboratories are capable of doing more detailed diagnostic work and
       should be so engaged.

8.     Lessons learned. The following summarizes key recommendations and lessons
learned.
     Surveillance directed at HPAI lends itself to adaptation to the detection of other
       major economic and zoonotic diseases and this should be considered by DAH and
       VEC in order to justify the considerable cost of effective surveillance.
     Maximum advantage should be taken from the positive outcomes of AICP to
       demonstrate to GON decision makers, particularly and the Ministry of Finance
       (MOF), the importance of the livestock sector in general and the poultry sector in
       particular to the livelihoods of a significant proportion of the rural population and
       to the economic health of the country as a whole.
     AICP’s activities in the field have unearthed an immense number of individuals
       and households who are entering small scale commercial poultry production with
       inadequate knowledge and experience of husbandry practices relating to housing,
       nutrition, management and marketing of poultry which in many cases leads to
       excessive losses and poor production. There is a significant pool of technical
       capacity in and around Chitwan district and the veterinary faculty at Rampur
       which could be engaged to develop and multiply a force of poultry extensionists
       to support and guide this expanding trend.
     The policy relating to cross border trade should be reviewed and, rather than a
       blanket ban, a strategy of defined entry points with minimum facilities for
       inspection of live birds should be considered. The entry points should be
       operational throughout daylight hours (at least) and manned by uniformed
       quarantine office staff with powers to detain birds or refuse entry, and equipped
       and trained to conduct rapid antigen tests for HAPI and ND and in the collection
       and dispatch of laboratory samples for further testing. The aim would be to work
       with traders and facilitate entry at those points while maintaining a prohibition
       elsewhere backed up by regulations. A mechanism must be in place to ensure no
       unauthorized charges are levied at the inspection points. The legislation banning
       direct cross border importation of poultry and poultry products from India should
       be amended to reflect this change.
     Internal movement control and inspection points need to be made effective and
       can operate in the same manner as described above for cross border inspection
       points. Signs displayed at inspection points, border or internal, should clearly
       indicate that charges are not to be levied and give a telephone number, ideally toll
       free, as in the case of the system operated by DAH bird flu monitoring cell, where
       contravention of this rule may be alerted.
     Passive surveillance should be encouraged. Communications should be given
       more emphasis within the DLS and awareness campaigns stressing the advantages

                                                                                         40
    of interaction with the field service staff promoted. Field staff in turn must be
    encouraged to communicate effectively with poultry keepers to address their
    demands and needs and to diligently investigate rumors of poultry mortalities.
    Rapid testing at DLS labs and by surveillance teams should be considered with
    appropriate safeguards.
   Active surveillance must be closely targeted in order to arrive at a process that is
    affordable and sustainable while retaining sufficient sensitivity. The interface
    between field technician and farmer must be optimized through training in
    participatory rural communications, reinforced periodically.
   Maximum advantage should be taken of the high quality staff at RVLs to expand
    the range of poultry diseases which they can diagnose, always with safeguards, to
    ensure cases are not missed. A continuous training program for RVL officers and
    laboratory technicians should be developed by CVL.
   A major problem at the moment is the failure of CVL to provide those who
    submit of samples for diagnosis with any response. The target should be for an
    immediate response for HPAI and ND with an indication of what further
    examinations are being carried out, where these are negative, and at least initial
    bacteriological and pathological results within 96 hours accompanied by advice
    on management and treatment. Failure to provide these results discourages
    farmer cooperation.
   Continued training for VEC officers is recommended to maintain and expand
    capability in risk assessment, management and reduction and to keep them up to
    date with surveillance techniques.
   The DLS may benefit from greater collaboration with the private sector both in
    developing sustainable approaches to disease detection and containment, and to
    jointly lobby GON to ensure wider understanding of the value of animal health
    services as well as its “public good? role, so that realistic budgets are set for key
    activities such as surveillance and laboratory operation.
   The DLS should also seek to improve links with the public health services,
    agencies dealing with wildlife and other relevant agencies recognizing that under
    a “One Health? banner disease control programs may be more efficient and carry
    more weight in negotiations with GON.
   Even though there had been provision to hire a private firm for M&E, importance
    focused on the technical side and, as a result, AICP suffered in reporting the
    progress on technical implementation and evaluation the report in a timely
    manner.
