MEMORhNDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT OF SDR 39.7 MILLION
TO THE REPUBLIC OF GUINEA
FOR A FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
1.        I submit the folloving Memorandum and Recommendation on a proposed
Development Credit to the Republic of Guinea for SDR 39.7 million (US$55 M
equivalent) for approval.  The proposed credit vould be on standard IDA terms
with 40 years' maturity and vould assist in financing a Fourth Highvay
Project.
2.        Background.  Since 1985, the Republic of Guinea has undertaken an
ambitious economic reform program to improve economic management and public
sector institutions, with substantial emphasis on public sector retrenchment
and privatization. The program vas supported by a first Structural Adjustment
Credit provided in 1986, and a second SAL vill be presented to the Executive
Directors shortly.   To assist the Government in deepening the adjustment
process and addressing the specific obstacles to lmproving performance of the
transport sector, a Transport Sector Project (TSP) vas approved in June 1987.
The TSP provides funding and technical assistance for restructuring sector
institutions and privatizing a number of transport activities. It also covers
rehabilitation of paved roads and essential needs of the ports and aviation
subsectors. However, important additional physical investments in the road
subsector are required in o. der to reopen the country's rich agricultural
hinterland and to enable the Government to achieve its economic objectives.
3.        Guineats national and regional road networks seriously deteriorated
during the First Republic.  The efforts made during the First and Second
Highway Projects vere limited to priority road sections and could not prevent
the overall deterioration of the road netvork as maintenance vas neglected
throughout the country.  Climatic circumstances (4m of rainfall per year)
considerably aggravated this situation. As a consequence, the national road
network of 14,000 km, of which 1,300 km are paved, is in poor condition and
the regional road network of 5,000 km is barely passable. Part of the coun-
try's main paved roads and priority gravel roads are being rehabilitated under
the Third Highway Project, but large areas of the country remain isolated,
which makes economic exchanges scarce and expensive. Accordingly, the Govern-
ment has set the folloving objectives in the road sector for the short and
long term: (a) further rehabilitation of the paved road network; (b) a repair
program of interrupted sections of the unpaved national road network (spot
improvement); (c) a rural roads improvement program; (d) construction of roads
between important centers of economic activity; and (e) strengthening of
routine and periodic maintenance operations.   The Bank and several other
donors fully support these objectives.
4.        Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The Bank Group has been among the
principal sources of external financing for transport sector development in
Guinea and has, since 1966, made three loans and five credits for road, port
and general transport sector projecta. The Fourth Highway Project, which
vould be the logical extension and complement of the TSP, under which most
sectoral conditionality vas agreed, vould be a continuation of IDA's assis-
tance to the development of Guinea's road network. Through this project, the
basis would be laid for the contribution of substantial external financing for



-2-
long-term support of the rehabilitation of Guinea's road network. IDA intends
to play a critical role in assisting the Government to achieve its objectives
in the road sector.
5.        Project Objectives.   The project would be the f irst phase of a
long-term development program to rehabilitate and improve the national and
regional road networks. It would lay the basis for effi_ient maintenance by
contract rather than force account, and build on the institutional improve-
ments pursued under the TSP. Through technical assistance and training of a
nucleus of national civil engineers, it would strengthen the management
capabilities of the Directorate General for Public Works (DGTP), which is
being reorganized, to enable it to assume the direction of construction and
maintenance operations in future phases of the road development program.
6.        Project Description.  The project would finance (a) construction to
paved standard of two major sections of the national road network
(Dubreka-Kolaboui, and Mamou-Kankan with a total length of 600 km); (b) spot
improvement over a total length of 1,500 km, including repair of drainage
systems, rehabilitation of bridges, and regravelling; (c) development of
routine maintenance by contract; (d) economic and technical studies to prepare
the next phase of the road development program, including feasibility studies
of about 600 km and final design of about 200 km; and (e) technical assis-
tance, training of, and fellowships for, DGTP staff in charge of planning,
supervision and management of civil works and maintenance operations. The
IDA-financed portion of the project, which vould be carried out over a
five-year period, provides funds for road construction, spot improvement,
supervision of construction, studies, training and technical assistance.
Final design and bidaing documents for the two major roads have been prepared
and divided into seven lots to facilitate participation of interested
co-donors. Total cost is estimated at about US$200 M equivalent, with a
foreign exchange component of about US$173 M (86% net of taxes).
7.        Agreed Actions.  Agreements have been reached on:  (a) an indicative
medium- to long-term road investment plan; (b) strengthening of DGTP's opera-
tional capacity with technical assistance hired under the TSP and acceptable
to IDA; (c) implementation of road maintenance by contract rather than force
account; (d) final design of road rehabilitation, identified under the project
and to be carried out during the next phase of the road development program;
and (e) as conditions of effectivenesa, (i) establishment of a Road Fund to
provide for local payments for road maintenance and spot improvement works;
(ii) promulgation of the new organizational structure of DGTP; and (iii) ap-
pointment of the team leader for the technical assistance under (b) above.
8.        Benefits.  Economic benefits under the project vould be derived from
increased agricultural production due to lmproved access to rural areas and
from increased inter-regional trade.  Road users would benefit froma signifi-
cant reductions in vehicle operating costs and much shorter travel times.
Improvement of the two major road sections to paved standard would have an ERR
of at least 11.2% and 13.1%. For spot improvement, the ERR would exceed, on
average, 26%, with a minimum of 12%.
9.        Risks.   Possible  riaks include DGTP's ability to implement  the
project in a timely manner in view of its lack of experience. This risk would



be mitigated by the advanced level of project preparation, the Ómpleuentation
of the project largely by contractors, and the technical assistance that would
be provided.  Another risk would be that the Road Fund and the investment
budget would not be adequately funded to permit timely payment of local
contributions to project expenditure. Current efforts under the TSP and the
SAL have increased the overall level of revenues and are working to substan-
tially improve the budgeting and fiscal management in the country. This risk
is, therefore, considered acceptable, also in view of the Government's strong
commitment to the success of the project because of its importance for the
revival of Guinea's economy.
10.       Recommendation.   I am satisfied that  the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve it.
