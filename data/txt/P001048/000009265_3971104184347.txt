REPUBLIC OF GUINEA
FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
(CREDIT 1915-GUI)
PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Fourth Highway Project in the
Republic of Guinea, for which Credit 1915-GUI in the amount of SDR39.7 million (US$55.0 million
equivalent) was approved on June 7, 1988, and made effective on June 26, 1989.
The Credit, which was amended and extended three times, was closed on December 31,
1996, after a delay of three years. The last disbursement took place on May 14, 1997. Parallel
financing for the project was provided by the African Development Bank (AfDB), the Caisse
Fran,aise de Developpement (CFD), the United States Agency for International Development
(USAID), the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund of Japan (OECF), the Arab Bank for Economic
Development in Africa (BADEA), and the European Community (EC).
The ICR was prepared by Mr. Abdelghani Inal (Sr. Highway Engineer) and Ms. Farida
Khan (Operations Analyst) of the Transport Unit 2, Central-Western Africa Department, Africa
Region, and reviewed by Ms. Maryvonne Plessis-Fraissard (Technical Manager, AFTT2) and
Mr. Mamadou Dia (Country Director, CD16). It is based on material in the project file and on an
ICR mission carried out from April 26 to May 2, 1997. The Borrower contributed to the preparation
of the ICR by preparing its owIn evaluation of the project's implementation (Appendix B) and by
commenting on the draft ICR. Comments were requested of the Guinea Country Team and the Task
Managers, who had appraised or supervised the project, and these were incorporated in this ICR.

FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
(CREDIT 1915-GUI)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
1.    The International Development Association (IDA) has been among the principal sources of
external financing for transport sector development in Guinea. Since 1975 IDA has provided six
credits for road, port, and other transport sector projects in the country. The Fourth Highway Project
continued IDA assistance for the development of Guinea's road network, its rehabilitation and
extension, and for strengthening local capacity to manage the sector. It complemented an earlier
IDA-assisted Transport Sector Project, under which most sectoral reforms had been carried out and
which had laid the basis for substantial long-term external financing for the rehabilitation of
Guinea's road network and the preparation of a new road sector strategy.
Project Objectives
2.    The major project objectives were to: (a) gradually increase the National Road Network and
enhance its level of service; and (b) further strengthen the capacity of the Ministry of Transport and
Public Works' (MTTP's) for managing the National Road Network.
3.    The objectives were to be achieved by implementing five components: (a) construction and
improvement of two major sections of the National Road Network (Dubreka-Kolaboui--196.5 km
and Mamou-Kankan--401 km) to paved road standard; (b) spot improvements over a total length of
1,500 km, including repair of drainage systems, rehabilitation of bridges, and regravelling;
(c) development of routine maintenance by contract; (d) economic and technical studies to prepare
the next phase of the road development program, including feasibility studies for about 600 km and
final design for about 200 km; and (e) technical assistance and training and fellowships for the
General Directorate for Public Works (DGTP) staff in charge of road planning, supervision, and
management of civil works and maintenance operations.
4.    The project objectives were clear and consistent with the Government's sector strategy. The
road network has been neglected and needed improvement and extension. As the performance of
contractors was generally satisfactory, and contracting out routine road maintenance to the private
sector was improving, it was considered opportune to expand it. The objective of strengthening
local capacity by training and technical assistance seemed realistic. The main risk mentioned in the
Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) was whether DGTP could implement the project on time because of its
lack of experience. To mitigate this risk, long-term technical assistance was provided to the DGTP;
nevertheless, there were long delays in project implementation and a lack of local staff participation
in project preparation and management. Other problems, not foreseen during appraisal, which
hindered project implementation, were: (a) insufficient availability of counterpart funding for road



iv
maintenance; (b) insufficient results from technical assistance and training for developing the local
capacity; (c) lack of reliable accounting system and internal control and long delays in carrying out
procurement and other procedures; (d) chaniges in customs and tax regulations, with retroactive
effect, which delayed contracts execution; and (e) absence of support for road management and for
private local contractors development.
Implementation Experience and Results
5.     The project's physical objectives were achieved, although implementation was slower than
expected. The two major sections of the national road network were constructed and improved to
paved road standard, except for the last section (94 km of the Mamou-Kankan road, financed by the
EC, which is to be finished by the end of 1999). Service was enhanced on about 1,378 km of earth
roads as planned. Tools for routine maintenance were procured, and labor-based road maintenance
(cantonnage), started under the pilot program, was so successful that it was expanded. Economic
and technical studies for the next phase of the road development program were carried out.
Technical assistance lasted about a year longer than had been planned.
6.     The achievement of jinancial objectives was negligible. The road fund is being replenished
from the national budget with insufficient and non-secured amounts, even though the taxes and
duties collected from road users would be sufficient to fund maintenance and extension of the
transport infrastructure network. The project's institutional development impact was substantial.
The MTTP was restructured into two ministries. The new Ministry of Public Works, which became
the Ministry of Public Works and Environment (MTPE) in 1995, set up three techlnical Directorates,
one each for road maintenance, road investment. and strategy and development, and tried to
strengthen the regional directorates. In addition, to improve the sector's efficiency, the MTPE
prepared a new road sector strategy (without the aid of any technical assistance), which it is planning
to implement through a major program of reorganization and decentralization. The capacity-
building objective was partially achieved. Local capacity was created in planning, programming,
and management of road investment and maintenance, but it needs to be strengthened further. The
private sector development objective was partially achieved. Although 100% of road maintenance is
being contracted out to local private contractors, the sector still needs further strength.
7.    Economic Evaluation. The 1996 average daily traffic was as follows: (a) on the Dubreka-
Kolaboui (Boke) road, 400% of the traffic forecast at appraisal, in spite of the poor services of the
Fatala River ferries; (b) on the Mamou-Kankan road, 300% of the forecast traffic, even though the
last section is not yet built; furthermore, the mining traffic of Siguiri area is expected to start soon
and reach 80,000 tons a year fairly quickly; (c) on the roads improved by the program of spot
improvements, 200% of the traffic forecast. When assuming a 3% traffic increase a year from 1996
onwards (which is rather low, at least for Mamou-Kankan road), the Economic Rates of Return
(ERR), based only on the net Vehicule Opetating Cost benefits, would be: (a) more than 20% for the
Dubreka-Kolaboui road (13% estimated at appraisal); (b) more than 40% for the Mamou-Kankan
road (11% estimated at appraisal); and for road improvement, the ERR would also be higher than
that estimated at appraisal.
8.     Costs and delays. The latest project cost estimate was US$207 million, compared with the
SAR estimate of US$200 million. This moderate increase was due mainly to exchange rate
variations, delays in implementation, use of higher construction standards than planned at appraisal,
reconstruction of two bridges, and technical assistance which lasted longer than planned. IDA
disbursed a total of SDR39.4 million for the project, or US$56.1 million compared to



v
US$55.0 million estimated at appraisal; the Government provided about US$8 million
(GNF7 billion) of its estimated contribution of US$19.2 million (GNF9.8 billion), while parallel
financing amounted to US$143 million.
9.     The delay in the startup of the project was mainly due to the painful and slow restructuring
of the MTTP implementation in addition to the poor quality of subproject technical studies available
at appraisal. The lack of resources for counterpart funding and for maintenance was the major factor
in causing further implementation delays. Other contributing factors were the delay in parallel
financing, and the long delays in the award of tenders following the receipt of bids because of
cumbersome Governnient review procedures. The failure to release funds promptly, or provide
customs clearance for equipment and goods (mainly petroleum products) imported by contractors,
and change in taxes, customs, and clearance regulations, were other factors of implementation delay.
Summary of Findings, Future Operations and Key Lessons Learned
10.   Overall, the project met most of its objectives and has had a large and positive economic
impact. Its sustainability would belikely if the Government makes available adequate funds for road
maintenance from user taxes and duties (or from another source) through the Road Fund. Otherwise
the sustainability of the project's achievements is uncertain.
11.   The Bank's performance in project preparation and supervision was satisfactory, although
during appraisal, Bank staff failed to identify some important risks. The Borrower's performance,
however, was deficient despite its satisfactory own assessment. The Borrower was slow in following
through on procurement procedures and the release of funds, and its management capacity Was
insufficient during project preparation and implementation.
12.    A proposed road sector management project was appraised in July 1992, but was dropped
because the conditions of negotiations on transport public enterprises privatization were not met.
However, at the most recent Public Expenditure Review Meeting in 1997, three sectors, including
the road sector, were identified as needing immediate attention. A new Road Sector Strategy, with a
view to increasing sector's efficiency, has been prepared by the MTPE. This could lead to a follow
up investment in integrated rural infrastructure, poverty alleviation, and capacity-building project,
provided that outcomes of this Highway IV Project are sustained.
13.    The lessons for future projects in the transport sector are:
a) adequate funds for routine road maintenance should be secured from user payments and
allocated to the project counterpart funds; Public Expenditure Reviews should play a
major role in ensuring that the Government adresses this important issue in the future;
b) project counterpart funds required for contracts should be totally paid up front, as
contract advance payment before the start of the works;
c) Other generic issues (such as procurement, custom duties, taxes, and procedures for
payment of local funds) should be addressed globally through institutional development
assistance. For greater efficiency and lower project costs, project management should
be delegated to private entities like AGETIP or a private road authority;



vi
d) technical assistance should be made available for the short term, with clear objectives
and monitorable performance indicators to be assessed frequently and included in
consultants' contracts;
e) local staff should be motivated and made responsible for project preparation,
implementation and sector management; and
f) the development of routine maiintenance executed by private local contractors should be
with project support to MTPE road management unit and to these local contractors.



IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF GUINEA
FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
(CREDIT 1915-GUI)
PART I - PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
BACKGROUND
I .    After 25 years of neglect, at the time of Project appraisal in 1987, Guinea's transport sector
was among the least efficient in the region and a major obstacle to achieving economic growth.
Most of the transport infrastructure was barely operable. The Government accorded the higlhest
priority to the creation of a sound policy framework and the re-establishment of essential transport
services.  In support of this strategy, the Government's investment program focused on the
elimination of four major bottlenecks: (i) the heavily deteriorated road system; (ii) the serious
congestion in the port of Conakry; (iii) the unreliable and unsafe air transport system; and (iv) the
difficulties of transforming a transport industry historically dominated by inefficient parastatals into
an efficient private service industry.
2.    IDA and a number of other multilateral and bilateral donors have been supporting the
Government's strategy througlh a series of projects financing priority investments and supporting
reform measures in the transport sector. The Transport Sector Project (Cr. 1915-GUI), signed in
May 1987 and completed in December 1993, was designed to ensure the establishment of an
appropriate sector policy framework and to meet the essential needs of the ports and aviation sub-
sectors. It was envisaged at the time that important additional investments were required in the road
sub-sector.
3.    The Highway IV Project, the sixth IDA-financed project in the transport sector in Guinea
approved in 1988; was aimed to further develop Guinea's road network, build capacity, provide
financing for routine road maintenance and assist in its privatization, and, although not included in
the original project design, start a dialogue on road sector policy. The project was the first phase of
a long-term program to improve the country's economic performance.
A.    STATEMENT/EVALUATION OF OBJECTIVES
4.    The major project objectives were to: (a) increase gradually the National Road Network and
enhance its level of service; and (b) strengthen further the MTTP's capability for managing the
National Road Network.
5.    The project included financing for civil works, equipment, and consultant services to carry
out the following five project components:
a)    construction and improvement to paved road standard of two sections of the National
Road Network: Dubreka-Kolaboui (196.5 km) and Mamou-Kankan (401 km);



2
b)    spot improvements over a length of about 1,500 km of the primary National Road
Network to ensure year-round accessibility, including repair of drainage systems,
rehabilitation of bridges, and regravelling;
c)     development of a routine maintenance policy for all rehabilitated portions of the
National Road Network;
d)    studies by consultants of the feasibility of improving about 600 km of the National
Road Network, followed by detailed engineering design for 200 km, and
miscellaneous economic and technical studies related to the transport sector; and
e)     provision of fellowships for training MTTP's staff in charge of road planning,
supervision, and management of civil works and maintenance operations, and
provision of technical assistance.
6.     Project objectives were clear and consistent with the Government's strategy. The road
network had been neglected and needed to be improved and extended. The performance of
contractors in road maintenance had been generally satisfactory and contracting out routine
maintenance to the private sector was to be expanded under the project. This was an appropriate
objective.  The objective of strengthening local capacity by training aind technical assistance
appeared to be realistic. The main risk identified at appraisal was the inability of the General
Directorate for Public Works (DGTP) to implement the project in a timely manner in view of its lack
of experience. To mitigate this risk, DGTP was to be provided with long-tern technical assistance
as well as short-term technical assistance for studies, supervision of works, and training.
7.    The following problems, however, were not identified at appraisal but later proved to be
real:
(a)    insufficient availability of local funds for counterpart funding and for routine road
maintenance; a large gap existed between the amounts planned in the Government's
annual budgets and the actual funds made available, which resulted in long delays in
payment to contractors and inadequate routine maintenance;
(b)    although some capacity in planning, programming, and management of road
investment and maintenance was created within the MTP, the results of technical
assistance (which was good and provided at levels higher than planned) and training
in developing local capacity were less than expected; this was mainly due to the lack
of motivation and inexperience of local staff; in addition, local staff had not been
made responsible for implementation, and the technical assistance that was provided
lacked clear objectives, benchmark indicators, and frequent assessment;
(c)    lack of reliable accounting system and internal control, cumbersome procurement
and other procedures which added to the reason for late payments to contractors and
other delays;
(d)    changes in customs and tax regulations implemented in 1995, witlh retroactive effect,
whichi had an impact on customs clearance procedures and contract costs and
resulted in interruption of works by contractors for several weeks and other delays
in project implementation; and
(e)    absence of support for road management and private local contractors development.

B.    ACHIEVEMENT OF OBJECTIVES
8.    Macroeconomic Policies. Not applicable.
9.    Sector Policies. The project objectives were substantially achieved: (a) the National Road
Network was improved and expanded; (b) 100% of road maintenance was contracted to the private
*sector; (c) the road sector strategy was reviewed to obtain more involvement of the private sector
and the regions; and (d) a long-term, rolling priority investment program was prepared.
10.   Financial Objectives.  The road fund is replenished from the national budget with
insufficient and uncertain amounts, although the taxes and duties collected from the transport sector
are sufficient to fund adequately the maintenance, extension, and renewal of the road network. The
resources allocated for road routine maintenance amounted to GNF2.8 billion in 1991, and decreased
to GNFI .2 billion in 1994, when the required amount was estimated at GNF4.7 billion. However, in
the last three years, the Government has allocated more resources for road maintenance:
GNF4.3 billion in 1995, GNF2.9 billion in 1996, and has planned for GNF7.0 billion in 1997.
Private contractors' lack of confidence in the capacity and willingness of the Government to pay
them resulted in slow implementation of work contracts. The IDA Credit had to be amended in 1995
to make up for the Government's payment arrears (SDR 850,000), and to update a Government
Action Plan on counterpart and maintenance funding .
11.   Institutional Development Objectives. The project institutional development impact was
substantial: (a) early after effectiveness, MTTP was restructured into two ministries, the Ministry of
Transport and the MTP; and (b) to improve efficiency in the road sector, the MTPE prepared a new
road sector strategy (without the help of technical assistance) and is planning to implement it through
a major program of reorganization and decentralization. Capacity has been created at the MTPE in
planning, programming, and management of road investment and maintenance, although some
further strengthening of this capacity is required. Road maintenance Decentralization to the MTPE
Regional Directorates and capacity building at the regional levels were onlypartially achieved; the
supervision of works was always carried out by the M FPE central staff through technical assistance.
Under the new road strategy, the Regional Directorates are to be responsible for road maintenance.
A new accounting system was set up at the MTPE and its staff trained.
12.   Environmental Objectives. The construction and rehabilitation of roads did not cause any
significant ecological problems. The new paved road surfaces eliminated unpleasant conditions for
the population living near the roads and improved traffic flow and safety, while increasing
accessibility in large areas of the country.
13.   Physical Objectives. Most of the project's physical objectives were achieved: (a) two
sections of the National Road Network--Dubreka-Kolaboui (196.5 km) and Mamou-Kankan (401
km) were paved to a high-level standard, with the exception of the last section (94 km) financed by
EC, which is still under construction; (b) spot improvements were made on some 1,378 km of the
primary National Road Network to ensure year-round accessibility; (c) labor-based road
maintenance (cantonnage) started under a pilot program was so successful that it was expanded to
the whole country; and (d) technical studies on the feasibility of improving 1,000 km of the National
Road Network, in addition to detailed design engineering studies for the Road Network sections
above, were completed.

14.   Economic Evaluation. The 1996 average daily traffic was as follows: (a) on the Dubreka-
Kolaboui (Boke) road, 400% of the traffic forecast at appraisal, in spite of the poor services of the
Fatala River ferries; (b) on the Mamou-Kankan road, 300% of the traffic forecast, although the last
section is not yet built; furthermore, the mining traffic of Siguiri area is expected to start soon and
reach 80,000 tons a year fairly quickly; (c) on the roads improved by the program of spot
improvements, 200% of the traffic forecast. When assuming a 3% traffic increase a year from 1996
onwards (which is rather low, at least for Mamou-Kankan road), the Economic Rates of Return
(ERR), based only on the net Vehicule Opetating Cost benefits, would be: (a) more than 20% for the
Dubreka-Kolaboui road (13% estimated at appraisal); (b) more than 40% for the Mamou-Kankan
road (11% estimated at appraisal); and for road improvement, the ERR would also be higher than
that estimated at appraisal. These EERs reflect the rich potential and resources of the country which
have yet to be fully exploited.
C.   MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING THE PROJECT
Factors not generally subject to Government Control
15.   The non-availability of parallel financing in a timely manner forced the Borrower to slow
down the implementation of part of the project, especially on the last section of Mamou-Kankan
road.
Factors generally subject to Government Control
16.   The reorganization of MTTP into two ministries led to some initial disorganization and
delays in project implementation. The Borrower's cumbersome procurement and other procedures
(mainly changes in customs and tax regulations in 1995, with retroactive effect; and delays in
customs clearance, principally affecting petroleum  products, cement, and equipment) led to
suspension of works by contractors and extensive delays in works to be completed. Other factors
which affected the project were the failure to promptly release funds to contractors and the non-
availability of counterpart funds. Eventually this led to a Government Action Plan to allocate
adequate funds for maintenance and counterpart, and to an amerndment to the IDA Credit Agreement
in April 1995 to finance arrears in counterpart funds. As a result, an improvement in routine
maintenance financing was noticeable over the course of the last three years.
Factors generally subject to Implementing Agency Control
17.   Management. Lack of motivation and experience on the part of the implementing agency
staff contributed to significant delays in procurement, payment to contractors, capacity building
(through technical assistance and training), and in routine maintenance by contractors. Lack of
internal controls and a weak accounting system also delayed timely payment to contractors.
18.   Cost and financing. The latest project cost estimate was US$207 million, compared with the
SAR estimate of US$200 million. This moderate increase was mainly attributable to exchange rate
variations, implementation delays, use of higher construction standards than planned (stabilization
with cement of about 500 km of base course not planned at appraisal, asphalt concrete in lieu of
double surface treatment on 310 km), reconstruction of two bridges, and technical assistance which
lasted longer than planned. IDA disbursed (SDR39.4 million) US$56.1 million, compared with
US$55.0 million estimated at appraisal; the Government provided about US$8 million



5
(GNF7 billion) of its estimated contribution of US$19.2 million (GNF9.8 billion), while the parallel
financing amounted to US$143 million. OECF and IDA had to make up the deficit in Government
counterpart financing.
19.   Implementation Delays. Late project startup due to delay in conditions of effectiveness
fulfilment, poor technical studies available at appraisal, delays in parallel financing, slow and
cumbersome procurement procedures and other processes (changes in tax and custom regulations
and clearance), and long delays in payments to contractors because of insufficient counterpart funds
resulted in a three-year delay in project completion. The last section of Mamou-Kankan road to be
built with EC financing is expected to take another three years.
D.    PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
20.    The achievements of the project are likely to be sustainable if the Government makes
available adequate funds for road maintenance from road user taxes and custom-duty payments (or
some other source) and channels them to the Road Fund. Project results, such as its substantial
economic impact, ministry reorganization, contracting out 100% of routine maintenance to the
private sector, capacity built at the MTPE with Directorates able to manage the road sector and
effectively carry out new road projects, without full-time technical assistance, augur well for project
sustainability. Delays in future project implementation could be avoided by delegating project
implementation to a private entity like AGETIP or a Poad Authority; otherwise, project
sustainability is uncertain.
E.  BANK PERFORMANCE
21.   In project identification, the Bank's performance is rated satisfactory. The project was
consistent with the Bank's strategy of promoting maintenance by private contractors, rehabilitating
the road network and enhancing its level of service, and building local capacity.
22.   In project preparation and appraisal, the Bank's performance is rated satisfactory overall.
The Bank assisted the Borrower in preparing the technical, institutional, and physical aspects of the
project with the assistance of a team that included economists, a financial analyst, a transport
specialist, a construction specialist, and a highway engineer. The Bank's assessments of the road
network and of the necessary measures to bring about improvements in its physical conditions were
realistic. However, the Bank was optimistic in its judgment about the Borrower's ability to increase
its management capacity rapidly and implement the project in a timely manner. The Bank did not
anticipate the delays that would result from poor technical studies, cumbersome procurement
procedures and other processes or from the lack of counterpart financing and funds for routine
maintenance.
23.    The Bank's performance in supervision is rated satisfactory. The frequency of supervision
missions (every four to six months) was adequate. The Bank's relationship with the Government,
although somewhat conflicted in the areas of generic country issues such as procurement and
counterpart funding, was constructive and collaborative on the whole. The Bank strongly urged the
Government to comply with the counterpart funding requirements, in accordance with the
Development Credit Agreement. The successive extensions of the closing date were used to press
the Borrower to take action. The extensions of the closing date in 1993 and in 1994 were made
subject to the implementation of a comprehensive action plan that was agreed upon with the



6
Government. This action plan was aimed at resolving the counterpart funding issues and road
maintenance financing. In accordance with this plan, all arrears were paid by the Borrower (except
for some of the interest fee for late payment). To further help the Borrower, at the time of the third
extension in 1995, the Bank agreed to finance arrears in counterpart funds owed to private
contractors as of October 31, 1994 (SDR 850,000), and had the.Borrower commit itself to financing
all road maintenance in 1995 (GNF4.5 billion) and to provide further counterpart funds in a timely
manner. The Resident Mission should had been more active mainly on disbursements matters.
F.  BORROWER PERFORMANCE
24.   The Borrower's performance is rated deficient despite its satisfactory owIn assessment and
the successful contracting out to private sector of 100% of road maintenance. The Government did
not allocate adequate funds for road maintenance in a timely manner. Project's implementation
lagged because of the accumulated arrears in payment of the Government's share of the project costs
and lack of resources for road maintenance. These arrears caused financial difficulties for private
contractors. The Borrower's cumbersome review procedures caused long delays in the award of
tenders following the receipt of bids.
25.   The shortfall in parallel-financing exacerbated the situation, as the Borrower had to look for
funding elsewhere. It would have greatly facilitated a timely execution , if the Bank and the
Borrower had insured the availability of parallel financing by the time that the IDA credit was
signed.
G.  ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOME
26.    The project's outcome is considered satisfactory as its objectives were achieved. The
project is expected to continue to yield significant development benefits. The road network was
extended and its level of service enhanced; routine maintenance is now totally contracted out to
private contractors; local staff were trained and they are nlow satisfactory managing the road sector;
and a new road strategy was prepared with a view to increasing the sector's efficiency.
H.    FUTURE OPERATION
27.   A proposed road sector management project was appraised in July 1992 but was dropped
because conditions of public transport enterprises privatization were not met. However, at the most
recent Public Expenditure Review in 1997, three sectors, including the road sector, were identified
as needing immediate attention. A Road Seetor Strategy was prepared by the Borrower in 1997
which could lead to a follow-up investment in integrated rural infrastructure, poverty alleviation, and
capacity-building project, provided that outcomes of this Highway IV Project are sustained.
I.     KEY LESSONS LEARNED
28.   The key lessons learned from project implementation are as follows:
a) Adequate funds for routine maintenance should be secured from user payments and
allocated to the project as counterpart funds; Public Expenditure Reviews should play a
major role in ensuring that the Government adresses this important issue in the future.



7
b) Project counterpart funds required for contracts should be totally paid up front as an
advance payment, before the start of works.
c) Other generic issues (such as procurement, custom duties, taxes, and procedures for
payment of local funds) should be addressed globally through institutional development
assistance. For greater efficiency and lower project costs, project management should
be delegated to private entities like AGETIP or a private road authority.
d) Technical assistance should be made available for the short term, with clear and
monitorable objectives and performance indicators that can be assessed frequently and
included in the consultants' contracts.
e) Local staff should be motivated and made responsible for project implementation and
sector management.
f) The development of routine maintenance executed by private local contractors should be
with support to the MTPE road management unit and to these local contractors.

APPENDIX A
REPUBLIQUE DE GUINEE
Quatrieme Projet Routier (cr. 1915)
Preparation du Rapport d'Achevement du Projet
Mission de l'IDA du 26 avril au 2 mai 1997
Aide-Mimoire de la mission
1.    Une mission de 1'IDA a ete effectuee en Guinee du 26 avril au 2 mai 1997 par M.
Abdelghani Inal, Charge du Projet, pour preparer le rapport d'achevement du projet et
discuter avec l'Administration en charge du secteur routier de l'atteinte des objectifs du
projet et des conclusions a en tirer. La mission a eu des entretiens avec S.E. Monsieur El
H. M. Cellou Diallo, Ministre des Travaux Publics et de l'Environnement (MTPE), MM.
le Secretaire general du MTPE, le Chef du Bureau de Suivi et Developpement (BSD), le
Directeur National des Investissements Routiers (DNIR), et le Directeur National de
l'Entretien Routier (DNER). La mission exprime tous ses remerciements aux personnes
rencontrkes pour leur totale disponibilite et leur entiere cooperation.
2.    Le pr6sent aide-memoire r6sume les principales conclusions de la mission, en
attendant l'envoi au Gouvernement du rapport d'achevement du proj et prepare par l'IDA:
(a)   rappel des objectifs du projet et leur evaluation, et description du projet;
(b)    atteinte des differents objectifs du projet;
(c)    cofits du projet et evaluation economique;
(d)   facteurs ayant affecte la mise en oeuvre du proj et;
(e)    durabilite des investissements du projet; et
(f)    principales lecons tirees du projet.
A.    Objectifs et description du projet.
3.    Les principaux objectifs du projet etaient: (a) 1'extension progressive du reseau
routier national et 1'amelioration de son niveau de service; et (b) le renforcement des
capacites du Ministere des transports et des travaux publics a gerer le r6seau routier. Pour
atteindre ces objectifs, le projet comportait cinq composantes: (i) construction en route
revetue de deux principales liaisons du reeseau routier (Dubreka-Kolaboui et Marnou-
Kankan, avec un total de 600km); (ii) elimination de points critiques sur une longueur de
1500km, incluant reparation des systemes de drainage, rdhabilitation de ponts et
rechargement; (iii) developpement de l'execution de l'entretien courant a 1'entreprise; (iv)
6tudes techniques et economiques pour preparer la phase suivante de developpement du
reseau routier, y inclus les etudes de factibilite de 600km de routes et les etudes

d'execution de 2OOkm; et (v) assistance technique, formation et bourses pour le personnel
de la Direction g6nerale des travaux publics (DGTP) en charge du reseau routier.
4.     Les objectifs du projet etaient clairs et conformes aux objectifs du Gouvernement.
Le reseau routier a e  longtemps neglige et necessitait rehabilitation, amelioration et
extension pour desservir correctement de vastes et riches regions du pays. L'execution de
l'entretien routier par de petites entreprises locales repondait a un souci d'efficacite. Le
renforcement des capacites locales par des actions de formation et par un apport
d'assistance technique etait un objectif realiste. L'appui d'une assistance technique pour
la mise en oeuvre du projet etait aussi normal du fait de l'experience insuffisante du
personnel local.
B.    Atteinte des objectifs du projet
5.     Les objectifs physiques du projet ont ete pratiquement tous atteints, malgre le
demarrage tardif du projet. Les deux principales liaisons routieres ont ete construites en
routes revetues (A l'exception du demier lot de 94 km de la route Mamou-Kankan,
finance par la Communaute Europeenne, dont l'achevement est prevu fin 1999) et le
niveau de service a e  ameliore sur 1378km de routes en terre en les rendant praticables
par tous temps en traitant les points critiques (assainissement, drainage, ponceaux, ponts,
"bourbiers"). L'ex6cution de l'entretien routier par cantonnage et par des petites
entreprises s'est developpee, et les etudes techniques et economiques pour une seconde
phase de developpement du reseau routier ont e  entreprises.
6.     L'atteinte des objectifs financiers a e  negligeable, le fonds routier ayant e
aliment6 par le Budget national, de maniere irreguliere et aleatoire, avec des montants
insuffisants pour assurer un entretien correct du reseau routier, bien que les fonds
provenant des usagers de la route par le biais des taxes et droits qu'ils paient sont
largement suffisants pour couvrir non seulement les depenses d'entretien routier, mais
aussi celles d'extension et de renouvellement du r6seau routier et de paiement de la dette
dfie aux emprunts des investissements routiers.
7.     Les objectifs de developpement institutionnel ont ete atteints par la reorganisation
de l'ancien Ministere des Transports et des Travaux Publics et la creation du Ministere
des Travaux Publics avec trois directions techniques, celle des investissements routiers,
celle de l'entretien routier, et celle de la programmation et du suivi. Le MTP a aussi
essaye de renforcer les directions regionales des travaux publics. Par ailleurs, voulant
augmenter l'efficacite du secteur, il a prepare une nouvelle strategie routiere qu'il se
propose de mettre en oeuvre avec un programme de reorganisation et de decentralisation,
avec l'appui des partenaires au d6veloppement.
8.       Des capacite's locales ont et6 developpees en matiere de gestion du reseau
routier, programmation et suivi des inxvestissements et de l'entretien routier, au contact de
l'assistance exterieure et par des actions de formation. Par ailleurs, l'objectif de

22
-developpement des entreprises locales privies a ete atteint par l'execution de l'entretien
courant A 100% A l'entreprise.
C.    Cofits et evaluation economique du projet
9.    Les estimations initiales du projet ont ete depassees sur la section Dubreka-Boffa
(financement CCCE) pour des problmes techniques. Les lots I et 2 (OECF) de la route
Mamou-Kankan ont connu un depassement des previsions initiales duies A l'addition de la
reconstruction de deux ponts, le traitement non prevu de la laterite au ciment en couche
de base, et le revetement de la route en beton bitumineux au lieu d'un enduit superficiel
bi-couche. Le lot 3 (IDA) est reste dans les limites des estimations initiales bien que la
couche de base a aussi ete traitee au ciment. Le lot 4 (BADEA) a subi les consequences
de l'augmentation du taux de change du DM (monnaie de paiement du marche de
travaux), en plus des ameliorations citees ci-avant, apportees egalement a ce lot. La
section 5 connait des changements importants dans la conception du projet, notamment
par la construction d'un pont non initialement prevu sur le fleuve Niger, et couitera bien
plus chere que prevue A l'evaluation du proj et. L'elimination des points critiques a cofut
moins que prevu A l'evaluation du projet. En conclusion, sans le pont sur le Niger (lot 5)
et sans les ponts des lots 1 et 2, le depassement des previsions initiales exprimees en
Dollars americains est de l'ordre de 3.5%, compar6 a une baisse du taux de change
moyen du dollar par rapport au FF (monnaie de paiement des principaux marches de
travaux et de consultants) sur la periode 1988-1996 de 12% environ (1$=6,18 FF en
1988, et 1$=4,95FF en 1995).
10.   L'evaluation economique du projet etait basee sur les productions agricoles des
regions situees dans les zones d'influence des deux routes qui ont et construites et sur les
debits journaliers moyens, pour les sections traitees dans le cadre de l'F1imination des
points critiques. Pour la route Boffa-Kolaboui, les statistiques disponibles pour l'ann6e
1995 aussi bien pour les productiorns agricoles que pour le trafic automobile lui-meme,
montrent que les previsions faites lors de l'evaluation du projet sont tres largement
depassees; la rentabilite de cette route est certainement bien superieure aux previsions
initiales. La production agricole de la zone d'influence de la route Mamou-Kankan a
depasse egalement les previsions faites, a l'exception de celles liees A la production du
coton. Toutefois, la baisse de trafic dfie au coton serait largement compensee par le trafic
du aux activites minieres (region de Siguiri) et qui avoisinerait 80 000 t/an (plus que le
double des previsions de tonnage de coton en 1996). Le taux de rentabilte de la liaison est
certainement superieur A celui prevu lors de l'evaluation, particulierement pour le lot 3
dont les couits n'ont pas depasse les previsions. Pour les sections traitees en elimination
des points critiques, les donnees actuelles de trafic donnent des valeurs superieures aux
previsions; les cofits previsionnels n'ayant pas ete depasses, la rentabilite est superieure A
celle qui etait prevue. Globalement, la rentabilite du projet pourrait etre appreciee comme
largement superieure aux previsions faites lors de l1'valuation du projet.

23
11.   Le demarrage lent du projet etait dfi, au depart, a la reorganisation du Ministere
charge du projet, a la mise en place tres lente de la nouvelle organisation au MTP, et au
manque W'exp6rience du personnel. Les longues procedures de passation des marches
ainsi que celles liees a des procedures administratives (dedouanement des equipements et
marchandises importes pour le projet, changement de regime de taxation des entreprises,
long delai pour le paiement des contreparties locales, etc) ont entramin (et entrainent
toujours) des retards certains dans l'execution du projet. L'insuffisance de la comptabilite
du projet (engagements et depenses) n'a pas permis de proceder a temps a des
engagements de depenses pour les travaux d'elimination des points critiques.
E.    Durabilite des investissements du projet
12.   La durabilite du projet ne peut etre assuree que si les routes construites ou
rehabilitees dans le cadre du projet ainsi que le reste du reseau routier sont entretenus
correctement (entretien courant et entretien periodique). Pour cela, des ressources
adequates doivent etre affectees au Fonds routier en temps utile pour mener a bien les
operations d'entretien du reseau. Pour ameliorer l'efficacite de l'allocation des ressources
et de l'entretien du reseau, l'organisation de l'entretien serait a revoir pour mieux
impliquer et responsabiliser les directions regionales, et associer les usagers a la gestion
du reseau routier. Les capacites locales seraient a developper davantage, aussi bien au
sein de I'administration que dans le secteur prive. Sans amelioration dans le volume des
dotations financieres pour l'entretien routier, leur affectation rationnelle et leur utilisation
efficiente accompagnee d'un renforcement qualitatif des structures, la durabilite du projet
serait incertaine.
F.     Principales Jecons tirees de 1'execution du projet
13.   Les principales le,ons a tirer de I 'execution du projet pourraient se resumer
comme suit:
(a)    la disponibilite de fonds adequats pour l'entretien routier et l'execution
correcte de l'entretien routier sont les conditions de succes de toute
politique routiere et devraient etre le prealable a tout investissement;
(b)    les capacites locales (administration, secteur prive et usagers) devraient
etre impliquees davantage dans la gestion du reseau routier, la
programmation, et 1'execution des travaux, en creant les conditions
necessaires a leur ddveloppement, en les responsabilisant, et en les
motivant;
(c)    les procedures administratives devraient etre simplifiees et les tracasseries
douanieres et fiscales clarifiees avant le demarrage de tout projet, ou alors
des procedures specifiques claires et rapides devraient etre arretees et
mises en oeuvre pour chaque projet; et

24
(d)    I'assistance technique exterieure devrait intervenir sur des periodes
courtes, avec des objectifs clairs, et des indicateurs de performances a
atteindre mesurables et contractualises; le personnel local en formation
avec cette assistance technique devrait etre sanctionne positivement ou
negativement selon les resultats atteints.
14.   La mission reste persuadee que la nouvelle politique du Gouvemement dans le
secteur routier (en cours de finalisation par le MTPE) apportera les changements
necessaires pour une meilleure gestion du reseau routier, son entretien adequat, et sa
sauvegarde, seuls garants de son extension pour les besoins de l'economie et du
developpement. L'importance A accorder A 1'entretien routier dans la definition des
priorites du secteur et du Gouvemement permettra un developpement harmonieux du
reseau routier et des couits de transport raisonnables.
15.   La mission prend note que le rapport d'achevement du projet prepare par le
Gouvernement sera envoye A l'IDA avant le 25 mai 1997.

APPENDIX B
SUMMARY OF THE BORROWER
IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
Fourth Highway Project (Cr. 1915)
1.    Project Design
Project objectives and components were well designed.
However, the following issues which were not addressed, would have made the
project impact higher and the implementation easier: (i) the spot improvement
program would have taken into account the consequences of traffic increase on
bridges not improved; (ii) the project had no subcomponent to support local
contractors in road maintenance; (iii) guidelines for knowledge transfer were not part
of the technical assistance design; and (iv) the tools for an efficient road management
were not planned in the project.
2.    Project Preparation
-  Project preparation (studies not available) and participation of regional staff was
insufficient.
3.    Project Implementation
-  Overall the project execution was satisfactory and its main objectives were reached.
-  The physical objectives were reached with delays which were due to: (i) different
donor procedures and lack of coordination and harmonization in project conception
and planning; (ii) the weakness of the technical studies available at project appraisal;
(iii) the lack of experience of local staff on Bank procedures: (iv) the lack of local
counterpart funds; and (v) the change in taxation rules without preparation of finance
staff in managing this change.
-  The relations among local staff and consultants in work supervision were not easy,
and the results of technical assistance in knowledge transfer were insufficient.
-  Reallocation of funds to allow the government pay the counterpart arrears from the
Credit, good technical assistance, commitment and competency of local staff, and
good collaboration between Bank and Administration had a positive impact on
project implementation.



26
4.     Borrower Performance
The Borrower performance is satisfactory, in spite of its feeble participation in
project design and preparation that led to the total privatization of execution of
routine maintenance and concentration of technical assistance into the ministry.
Frequent Ministry organization changes, lack of counterpart funds, weak project
monitoring since technical assistance departure should be mentioned. However,
procurement and payment procedures have improved.
5.     Bank Performance
-  Overall, the Bank performance was satisfactory, with steady supervision missions,
listening to Borrower problems and comprehensive.
- However, Bank impact on project implementation would have been more efficient if
the following conditions were met: (i) higher participation of the Resident Mission
in project implementation, mainly in disbursement procedures and local staff training
on disbursement procedures; (ii) better participation of Borrower staff in project
design, preparation and appraisal.
-  The Bank decision to introduce sector projects involving the other transport
subsectors led to an interruption of Bank involvement in the road sector.
6.     Lessons Learned
- Involvement of Borrower staff in project design and preparation, sound design of
technical assistance and training, and designation of a project coordinating unit
would improve future project preparation and implementation.
- In order to preserve Bank continuity in the road sector, even though through other
sector project, the Bank conditionalities should not be cross sectors.
- Project preparation and appraisal should be based on actual and serious studies.
- The execution of road maintenance by local contractors would be progressive, based
on technical and financial capacity of contractors which should be supported by
technical assistance.

RAPPORT D'ACHEVEMENT DU QUATRIEME PROJET ROUTIER
PARTIE DE L'EMPRUNTEUR
Credit N 1915 GUI
1.    Introduction
Le quatrieme Projet Routier, finance par plusieurs bailleurs de fonds, dont la Banque mondiale
comme chef de file, comporte cinq composantes. La description du Projet figure dans la partie I
du rapport d'achevement, dont la redaction est assuree par la Banque Mondiale. Elle est
cependant r6sumee en annexe au pr6sent rapport. Les objectifs du projet, concu comme la
premiere etape d'un programme d'investissement et d'entretien A long terme, 6taient:
(a) d'6tendre progressivement le reseau routier national et le niveau de service qu'il assure et
(b) d'accroitre la capacite du Ministere des Travaux Publics A gerer ce reseau.
Le cout previsionnel du Projet au moment de son evaluation etait estime A 200 millions de
dollars US en 1988, dont 55 millions de dollars US de financement IDA. L'estimation du cofit
du Projet a son achevement ressort A 207,3 millions de dollars US, pour un financement de
l'IDA de 56,1 millions de dollars US. L'intervention des differents bailleurs de fonds du Projet
est donnee ci - apres:
IDA                    56,1 millions de $ US
CFD                    44,8 millions de $ US
USAID                   23 millions de $ US
OECF                   34,5 millions de $ US
BADEA                  11,8 millions de $ US
BAD                     6,3 millions de $ US
FED                    22,7 millions de $ US
Gouvernement            8,1 millions de $ US
Total                207,3 millions de $ US
Le present rapport concerne essentiellement la partie financee par l'IDA. Le projet a connu un
succes. Globalement les principaux objectifs ont e  atteints meme si un certain nombre de
problbmes ont ete rencontre aux differents stades du projet.
2     Conception du Projet
Le Projet a et en general bien concu. Le quatrieme Projet Routier a et initie dans la continuite
du Projet Sectoriel Transport (PST) qui, bien qu'ayant permis d'identifier de nombreux besoins en
matiere d'investissement et d'entretien du reseau routier, n'avait repondu qu'aux besoins en
investissement des sous-secteurs portuaire et aeroportuaire.



28
Les differentes composantes du Projet, telles que definies en annexe au present rapport
repondaient done aux contraintes du sous secteur routier guineen, A savoir l'insuffisance du
reseau routier bitumd, le manque d'entretien dont souffrait le rdseau routier, et la faible capacite
des cadres nationaux A gerer l'execution de travaux A 1'entreprise. En effet, deux aspects
fondamentaux du quatrieme Projet Routier refletent les solutions apport6es d'une part aux
contraintes du sous-secteur routier et d'autre part aux le,ons tirees de 1'execution du PST:
-  un accent particulier dans le cadre de ce Projet a ete mis sur la construction et
I'amelioration du reseau routier bitume pour environ 600 km;
-  une attention particuliere a egalemenit ete apportee A I'amelioration de la capacite
directe de I'administration A preparer et suivre des projets routiers, tant par la
formation de ses cadres, que par l'appui d'une assistance technique.
Cependant, I'impact du projet aurait ete plus important et son execution plus facile, si la
conception du Projet avait integre les elements suivants:
-  dans la definition du programme d'elimination des points critiques, I'etat de
degradation des routes et pistes en terre a ete sous estimee. En effet, une fois
rehabilites, les points critiques consideres de premiere urgence, le trafic induit
conduisait tres rapidement A des ruptures d'ouvrages consid6res de 2eme urgence, ou
A I'impraticabilite de tron,ons se comportant comme des canaux d'ecoulement d'eau.
Aussi, le 2eme programme d'elimination des points critiques a retenu comme niveau
d'amenagement des itineraires, la reparation ou reconstruction de tous les ouvrages
defectueux et le reprofilage lourd sur toute la longueur des itineraires programmes.
-  la privatisation totale de 1'execution de l'entretien routier n'a pas suffisamment pris
en compte la situation objective des PME du secteur des TP en Guinee. Aucune
etude sur les capacites du secteur prive tant du point de vue technique, que financier
n'a ete realisee. Ainsi, les mesures d'accompagnement A cette privatisation de
1'execution de 1'entretien routier (mise en place d'un environnement reglementaire
incitatif; prise en compte de la progressivite dans le passage de la regie aux travaux
executes par des PME), n'ont-elles pas et integrees au projet.
-  le mecanisme de transfert effectif de competence a manque dans la conception de
I'assistance technique. Par ailleurs, on aurait pu prevoir une assistance a la DGTP
pour la mise en place des outils de gestion efficace du personnel.
- les moyens materiels pour assurer une gestion efficace du reseau n'ont pas et
prevus.
3.     Preparation du Projet
La preparation du Projet a e  marquee par l'insuffisance des dtudes disponibles. En effet, les
etudes de faisabilite technique et economique pour les constructions de routes, realisees par des



29
cabinets exterieurs, etaient obsoletes au moment de la preparation du Projet. Aussi, la faisabilite
economique a 6t6 appreciee par les experts de la Banque Mondiale au moment de l'evaluation du
projet. Avant le demarrage des travaux sur certains tron9ons, les etudes techniques d'execution
ont e  reprises par des bureaux prives exterieurs, sur financement des bailleurs de fonds. Cette
situation a conduit A un retard dans le d6marrage des travaux.
La preparation du Projet a egalement ete marque par une faible participation des cadres nationaux
du fait notamment d'une centralisation excessive au niveau des Directeurs.
4.     Execution du projet
Dans l'ensemble, le quatrieme Projet Routier a ete ex6cute de fa,on satisfaisante. Les objectifs
principaux du projet ont e  atteints mais A des degres divers en fonction des composantes.
-  au plan des realisations physiques: Le programme de construction et de rehabilitation
de routes revetues a e  execute. Les itineraires prevus ont ete realises. Cependant, le
rythme d'execution du Projet a varie d'un troncon A un autre en fonction du bailleur
de fonds. Ainsi, I'execution de certains tron,ons a souffert d'un important retard,
imputable aux procedures des bailleurs de fonds concernes et a un manque
d'harmonisation du point de vue des differents bailleurs de fonds sur l'evolution de
l'ensemble du Projet. Ces retards ont occasionne un depassement financier sur les
prestations du contr6le des travaux. Concernant, I'entretien routier. le programme
d'elimination des points critiques (EPC) qui prevoyait un traitement de 1500 km de
routes, a permis de traiter 1373 km. Au niveau des ouvrages 6 ouvrages metalliques
ont ete realises.
-  au plan des etudes techniques et de faisabilite: 1400 km de routes et 15 ouvrages de
franchissement sur le reseau national ont fait l'objet d'etude de faisabilite, contre 600
km de routes pr6vus dans le cadre du Projet. Cependant, aucune etude technique
d'execution n'a et realisee, compte tenu des faibles rentabilites obtenues sur les
tron,ons concernes et de la decision de la Banque de conditionner lesdites etudes a
l'avancement de la preparation du Projet Sectoriel Routier (PSR), alors que le projet
prevoyait l'execution d'etude technique sur 200 km de routes, dont la rentabilite
aurait ete etablie au cours des etudes de faisabilite.
-  au plan financier: L'enveloppe du financement IDA a permis la realisation des
composantes prevues dans l'accord de credit, malgre la prise en compte d'une partie
des arrier6s de contreparties national es sur le financement IDA.
-  au plan de l'organisation de la DGTP : La separation des investissements, de
l'entretien dans l'organisation a ete realisee avec la creation de la Direction Nationale
des Investissements Routiers (DNIR) et de la Direction Nationale de l'Entretien
Routier (DNER). Cependant, depuis le depart de I'assistance technique, qui assurait
la coordination de 1'execution du Projet, la production des rapports d'avancement et
des tableaux de bord de suivi physique et financier du Projet est devenue irreguliere.



30
au plan de la formation :des bourses de formation ont ete accordbes aux agents de la
DNIR et de la DNER, et des voyages d'etudes ont ete organisees aupres de plusieurs
organismes techniques, notamment dans la sous region. La formation sur le tas a ete
assur6e par la participation des agents de la DNER et de la DNIR a la preparation des
Dossiers d'Appel d'Offres et au suivi des chantiers. Cependant force est de constater
que les taches des agents detaches sur les missions de contr6le apparaissent quelque
peu difficiles. Les relations avec les bureaux de contr6le n'ont pas ete faciles.
au plan de I'assistance technique: L'assistance technique mise en place a fait preuve
de grande competence. Elle a ete logee au niveau des deux directions nationales
(DNIR et DNER). Les objectifs directs assignes A l'assistance technique ont 6t6
atteints quant A la gestion du quatrieme projet routier. Cependant, le transfert de
connaissance aux cadres nationaux n'a pas ete au niveau des esp6rances de ceux-ci.
II est indeniable toutefois, que les capacites de gestion de l'infrastructure routiere des
agents de l'administration des TP ont connu une nette amelioration.
au plan du developpement des PME: le projet a permis la naissance de quelques
PME d'execution de travaux d'entretien routier et de tacherons prives. Cependant la
realisation des travaux d'entretien routier par les PME nationales a connu de
serieuses difficultes (important retard dans l'execution des travaux, manque de
mat6riels adequats, manque de surface suffisante financiere et d'experience en la
matiere). Ainsi, ces PME n'ont pu etre associe au programme d'e1imination des
points critiques. Par ailleurs, aucune expertise nationale privee en matiere d'etude et
de contr6le n'a emerge.
Les facteurs ayant affecte negativement le projet au cours de son ex6cution sont les suivants:
la faiblesse de la qualite des etudes au moment de l'evaluation du projet par la
Banque, qu'il s'agisse d'etude technique ou d'etude de faisabilite. Cette situation a
conduit A un depassement des quantites sur la composante Dubreka-Boffa financ6e
par la CFD. Tirant les le,ons de cette situation, la Banque a fait executer une etude
technique sur le troncon Boffa-Kolabouyi avant le demarrage des travaux. Cette
etude, a partir de laquelle le quantitatif du marche a ete reajuste, a permis d'eviter des
depassements sur ce troncon;
l'absence de coordination efficace entre les bailleurs de fonds;
le manque de familiarite des cadres nationaux avec les procedures de decaissement
de la Banque, notamment celles relatives A la gestion du compte special et au suivi du
montant disponible par composante du projet;
-  le manque de disponibilite r6guli6re de fonds de contreparties nationales;
-  le changement en 1994 de la fiscalite applicable aux marches publics de travaux, qui
s'est traduit par la fin des exonerations fiscales et douanieres sans que les procedures
de regularisation au niveau du Ministere des Finances n'aient ete maitris6es.



31
Les e16ments ayant affecte positivement l'ex6cution du projet sont les suivants:
-  les composantes du projet ont et  modifiees pour prendre en compte sur le
financement IDA, le paiement d'une partie des arrieres de contreparties du
gouvernement guineen;
-  la bonne selection et la competence de I'assistance technique;
-  la competence et la disponibilite des cadres nationaux;
-  la bonne collaboration entre la Banque et I'adrninistration.
5.     Performance de l'Emprunteur
D'une maniere generale, la performance de l'Emprunteur peut etre jugee satisfaisante, bien que
faible pendant les phases de conception et de preparation du projet.
En effet, I'implication des competences nationales au stade de la conception et de la preparation
du projet a e  insuffisante. Ceci s'est notamment traduit d'une part par la privatisation totale et
sans transition de 1'entretien routier et d'autre part par une repartition desequilibree de
I'assistance technique et des opportunit6s de formation, qui ont 6t6 concentre exclusivement au
niveau des directions nationales (DNIR et DNER).
Par ailleurs, il y a lieu de noter les insuffisances suivantes:
-  modifications frequentes de l'organigramme du Ministere;
-  non paiement des contreparties nationales;
-  baisse de la capacite de suivi du projet depuis le depart de l'assistance technique, du
fait notamment de la non designation d'une structure dfiment mandate pour assurer la
coordination du Projet.
Neanmoins, des efforts ont ete accomplis par l'administration au niveau des points suivants:
-  diminution des delais en ce qui concerne le circuit et les procedures de passation des
marches et de paiement des ddcomptes. Le nombre de visas e  reduit. Par ailleurs,
I'approbation des marches d'entretien de montant superieur ou egal a 200 millions de
GNF, sur financement du Budget National, est du ressort du Ministre des Travaux
Publics;
-  amelioration de la coordination interministerielle au cours de 1'execution du Projet,
notamment avec les Ministeres charges du Plan et des Finances.



32
6.     Performance de la Banque
La performance de la Banque a ete satisfaisante dans 1'ensemble. En effet:
-  les missions de supervision de la Banque ont e  regulieres, ce qui a permis un suivi
ad6quat et la resolution continue des difficultes au cours du deroulement du projet;
- tout au long de l'execution du Projet, la Banque a prete une oreille attentive aux
preoccupations des autorites guineennes, en faisant preuve de comprehension. Au
besoin, des ajustements ont e  apportes pour rendre plus efficace le deroulement du
Projet ( prise en compte d'une partie des arrieres de contreparties nationales sur le
financement de la Banque, equipement des BRER).
Cependant, l'intervention de la Banque aurait eu un impact plus efficace sur le deroulement du
Projet, si:
- la mission residente de la Banque, compte tenu de sa proximite avec les agences
nationales d'execution, etait plus impliquee dans la gestion du Projet notamment en
ce qui concerne les procedures de decaissement;
- des precautions etaient prises au niveau de la Banque, pour assurer une coherence de
son intervention a I'occasion des changements de charges de projets;
-  il avait 6te procede au debut du Projet, a une explication des methodes et procedures
de la Banque aux differents responsables de l'administration, notamment ceux en
charge du suivi des decaissements;
- lors de la conception, de la preparation et de l'evaluation du Projet, les cadres
guineens avaient ete mieux associes.
Au niveau du sous-secteur routier, la continuit6 de l'intervention de la Banque s'est trouv6e
interrompue, du fait de la volonte de la Banque de mettre en place des projets sectoriels,
impliquant les autres sous-secteurs du secteur des transports.
7.     Lecons a tirer
Pour la preparation des futurs projets avec la Banque, une attention particuliere devrait etre
accordee aux preoccupations suivantes:
-  une implication des cadres nationaux dans la conception, et la preparation des projets
pourrait permettre d'eviter certaines difficultes lors de 1'execution;
-  une identification judicieuse des besoins en assistance technique et en formation, une
definition precise du transfert de competence attendu de I'assistance technique vers
les cadres nationaux constituent un facteur determinant pour la reussite des projets;
-  la preparation des futurs projets doit prendre en compte la necessite d'eviter une
rupture au niveau de l'intervention de la Banque dans le sous-secteur routier. Aussi,



33
il serait judicieux, a defaut de pouvoir monter une op6ration uniquement routiere,
d'6viter des conditionalites croisees entre sous-secteurs;
la preparation et 1'evaluation des projets doivent etre basees sur des etudes fiables et
recentes tant au niveau technique qu&au niveau economique;
la structure chargee de la gestion et du suivi des projets doit etre designee de maniere
a permettre l'elaboration reguliere des tableaux de bord physique et financier, ainsi
que les rapports d'avancement des projets. Ceci permettra a I'administration
d'apporter les mesures correctives appropriees et de facon diligente, pendant
l'execution des projets;
la realisation des travaux d'entretien routier par les PME nationales devrait etre
graduelle et tenir compte de la capacite technique et financiere des entreprises
ciblees, pour laquelle une assistance pourrait etre con,ue.

ANNEXE
La pr6sente annexe a pour objet de decrire de maniere succinte les differentes composantes du
quatrieme Projet Routier.
1.     Reconstruction, amelioration et revetement
Le Projet a prdvu de reconstruire et d'ameliorer. notamment au moyen d'un enduit
bitume, deux principaux axes du r6seau routier national - la route c6tiere Dubreka -
Kolaboui (200 km) et un troncon de la route principale reliant Mamou a Kankan, vers
l'Est (400 km), en conservant dans 1'ensemble leur trace actuel mais en ameliorant leurs
profils en long et en travers. Ces deux tron9ons comprendront une chaussee a deux voies
de circulation, de 7 m pour la route Dubreka-Kolaboui et de 6 m pour la route Mamou-
Kankan.
2.     Elimination des points critiques
Le Projet a prevu de financer les etudes techniques, la supervision et la realisation des
travaux d'elimination des points critiques portant sur environ 1.500 km de routes non
revetues appartenant au reseau routier national. Ces travaux devront porter
principalement sur la construction de systemes de drainage, la remise en etat des
ouvrages d'art, ainsi que la reparation et le rechargement des troncons impraticables,
avec travaux de terrassement selon les besoins pour eliminer les points critiques.
3.     Entretien routier
Entretien periodique: Du fait des travaux de remise en etat du reseau actuel de routes
revetues et des composantes revetement et amenagement localise proposees, 1'entretien
p,riodique n'aura besoin de commencer qu'environ cinq ans apres le lancement du
projet. Le Projet prevoit une politique de sous-traitance de l'entretien periodique, de
renforcement institutionnel sur la formation d'un nombre limite d'ingenieurs de
1'entretien qui seront amenes a diriger les travaux d'entretien periodique effectues a
1'entreprise.
Entretien courant :L'entretien courant du reseau routier national 6tait du ressort des 36
subdivisions de la DGTP, mais celles-ci n'ont pas fonctionne du fait d'un manque
d'organisation, de moyens techniques et de ressources financieres. Dans le cadre du
Troisieme Projet Routier, la DGTP a mis au point une methode de cantonnage; cette
methode, testee dans le cadre d'un projet pilote inclus dans le Projet du Secteur des
Transports, consiste a faire effectuer les travaux de d6broussaillage et d'entretien des
systemes de drainage par les villageois eux-memes. Aussi, le Projet a prevu le
financement par la DGTP du coOt de cette main-d'oeuvre, qui sera chargee de l'entretien
courant de trongons determines, longs de 4 km en moyenne. En outre , un groupe de
petits entrepreneurs sera forme aux techniques de realisation de ces travaux dans
certaines regions.

4.     Etudes de faisabilite et projet d'execution
Le projet a pr6vu des fonds pour la rdalisation d'une serie d'etudes de faisabilite portant
sur 600 km de routes environ et de projets d'ex6cution portant 200 km. Les itineraires
dont les taux de rentabilite economique seront superieurs A 10 %, feront l'objet d'etudes
d'execution, pour autant que le ddbut de leur r6alisation soit programme dans les trois
annees suivant la realisation des desdites etudes.
5.     Octroi de bourses de formation au personnel de la DGTP et assistance technique
Le projet a prevu des bourses pour permettre aux fonctionnaires de recevoir une
formation dans des pays voisins, et notamment A l'Ecole Nationale Superieure des
Travaux Publics en C6te d'Ivoire. Ces bourses devront &re octroyees sur la base d'un
programme de formation des candidats A soumettre A l'IDA.
Le projet a prevu en outre des fonds pour poursuivre l' assistance technique deja fournie A
la DGTP dans le cadre du Projet du Secteur des Transports, afin de permettre A la DGTP
de planifier, superviser et gerer les travaux routiers.
