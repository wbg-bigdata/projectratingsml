                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This report is being filed to reflect the Board's approval on March 22, 2012, of the Project's restructuring. Such restructuring included three key actions (i) revision of the wording
                         (but not substance) of the Project Development Objective in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) to align it with the objective stated in the Financing Agreement (FA); (ii) extension
                         of the Project's closing date from March 31, 2012 to June 30, 2013; and (iii) reallocation Credit proceeds across priority areas.

                         At the same time, since the last ISR was filed, there has been implementation progress --disbursement has increased from 67% to 88%, 12 schools are completed, and the pre-
                         university law was approved by the Council of Ministers and due for consideration in Parliament this month. The Project's result framework is partially updated to reflect areas where
                         new data has become available. Notwithstanding, the current debt ceiling is starting to negatively affect implementation, as some activities that were planned for this calendar year
                         are now expected to be postponed until 2013. The World Bank has been monitoring these constraints and advised the Ministry of Education and Science to prioritize outstanding

                         payments over new activities, and not start any new activity for which there was not guaranteed budget allocations.

                         A full implementation support visit is planned for June 2012, at which time all priority areas of the Project will be reviewed and this report will be updated again.
