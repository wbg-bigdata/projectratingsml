                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This report reflects the findings and conclusions of an implementation support visit carried out between October 8 - 11, 2012. During the visit to Tirana, Development Partners had the
                         opportunity to hear from a group of pre-university teachers and directors about the changes inside schools since 2006. It was a heartening reminder that, while there is still much to
                         be improved in Albania's education system, there were visible and tangible improvements in its public schools, many of them directly supported by the Project.

                         Unfortunately, budget ceilings in place for the last year have significantly slowed down project implementation, while creating arrears related to many activities financed by the
                         Project. Bank management has held frequent and extensive discussions with representatives of the Ministry of Finance (MoF), requesting that the payment of arrears be prioritized.
                         Unfortunately, current MoES projections for 2013 remain very low and the Project is expected to close without completing all the planned activities, and without fully disbursing from
                         any of its four financing sources (WB, EIB, CEB and Government).

                         The current budget situation and ensuing implementation slow-down, coupled with concerns about the sustainability of some investments over the next few years, have led the team
                         to do another review of the realism of the project development objective rating. There is evidence that the Project has led to an improvement in the quality of learning conditions for
                         students --as highlighted by teachers and principals recently; data show that enrollment has increased in secondary education; and higher education reform is far more advanced
                         than anticipated at the time of project design. Further, as previously stated, data on the four outcome indicators show that they have all been met, though revised data [expected in
                         mid-November] calculated on the basis of the new census may show otherwise. Finally, team members who have worked with MoES from the early stages of project design attest to
                         the significant institutional improvements in the last six years. In that context, the Project has met its development objective. At the same time, given that budget ceilings will result in
                         some activities not being carried out and/or completed and the Project will close with unspent funds from all Development Partners, as well as efficiency concerns regarding the civil
                         works, the team feels there are moderate shortcomings in the operation's achievement of its development objective. Thus, the Project's development objective rating remains
                         "Moderately Satisfactory."
