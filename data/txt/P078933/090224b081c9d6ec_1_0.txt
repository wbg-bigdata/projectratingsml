                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This is the final implementation supervision report for this project. However, as agreed with management, the World Bank will retain its supervisory role along CEB and EIB until their
                         financing of the Project also closes at the end of 2013.

                         The EEE-P Project has been under implementation for about seven years. During that period it has sought to: (a) improve quality of learning conditions for students; (b) increase

                         enrollment of students in general secondary education; and (c) initiate higher education reform. The achievement of these objectives is measured against four outcome indicators,
                         three of them achieved: (i) dropout rates in basic education have remained below 3%; (ii) the level of teachers’ satisfaction with their working conditions increased; and (iii) the
                         progression rate from basic to secondary education increased from 80.3% to 91.2%. The fourth indicator, increase in net secondary enrollment rates, shows an increase from 55% to
                         60.5%, but remains below the target of 70%. It should be noted, however, that enrollment data is subject to revisions once the new census data is made available; preliminary data

                         points to further improvements in enrollment rates. Finally, the Ministry of Education and Science (MoES) significantly advanced its higher education reform, far beyond what was
                         foreseen at project design: a higher education strategy was fully developed and is on its early implementation stages.

                         In addition to the achievement of most of its outcome indicators, the following intermediate indicators also point to the Project's contribution to improving the quality of learning
                         conditions: (i) 100% of primary schools are using a new curriculum and textbooks; (ii) 100% of secondary schools have adopted a revised curriculum; (iii) the number of students in
                         schools with multiple shifts was reduced from 36% to 14% in basic education and 15% to 5.6% in secondary education; (iv) triple shift schools were eliminated; and (v) the number of
                         students per computer decreased from 61 to 14.

                         At the same time, project implementation was marked by many challenges, including budget constraints in the last two years. While most of these challenges were overcome in the
                         course of implementation, budget ceilings have continued to affect the education sector and are expected to do so in the near future. As such, the World Bank's team remains
                         concerned about the sustainability and/or continuity of some of the interventions. A second concern related to some of the interventions supported under Project is their required
                         follow up by municipal authorities. This is particularly true in the case of the schools that were rehabilitated, extended or built with project funds; some of these schools still require
                         repairs, others are pending access to utilities, while all of them require sufficient funds for maintenance. Throughout implementation, the level of municipal engagement,
                         responsiveness, and institutional capacity has varied widely, and the mechanisms for MoES to engage municipalities seem insufficient. The absence of a clear mechanism to ensure
                         that municipalities comply with their education responsibilities is a risk to these investments.

                         In summary, all evidence confirms that the Project played an important part in supporting improvements in the quality of learning and in institutional development, as well as in
                         launching higher education reform. At the same time, taking into consideration efficiency and sustainability concerns and unresolved problems with civil works, the Project's
                         development objective is considered Moderately Unsatisfactory. Given that the Bank's team will continue supervising the Project for another six months, it is still possible that this
                         rating would be revised to Moderately Satisfactory, if the highlighted concerns are addressed by then.
