                         This report reflects the findings and conclusions of an implementation support visit carried out between June 12 and 20, 2012.

                         According to Government data, all of the four Project's outcome indicators have been met: (i) drop-out rates remain below their target; (ii) the percentage of teachers whose
                         satisfaction level is high increased from 29% to 39%, though the percentage of teachers with low satisfaction level also slightly increased from 13% to 14%; (iii) transition rates from

                         basic to secondary education reached 91.4%, compared to the 90% target; and (iv) gross secondary enrollment rates reached 76% compared to the 70% target. A noteworthy
                         caveat regarding these indicators is that while official, the drop-out and enrollment data are expected to undergo a revision once the latest census data is out. The Bank's team
                         anticipates that the revised drop out data will not be as low since current data is not realistic by international standards.

                         In terms of progress, since the last visit to Albania in October 2011, implementation improved substantially, with all of the concerns raised at that time addressed by the Ministry of
                         Education. However, during the last few months budget ceilings have significantly hindered project execution, and several activities had to be either canceled or postponed, and
                         there are several outstanding payments due. The current situation puts at risk the future sustainability of some of the interventions financed under the project.
