I. THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SECTOR
Background and Organization
1.01      Uruguay is a small, fertile, highly urbanized country with a slow
growing population of about 3.0 million of which 1.2 million live in
Mont:evideo, the capital. The people are highly literate, and culturally
homogeneous; GNP per capita in 1978 was about US$1,610.
1.02      Major economic reforms were launched in the mid 1970s addressed
towards attaining economic efficiency with market prices playing the major
role in resource allocation, strengthening production by the private sector,
and opening up the country to international business.
1.03      The Ministry of National Defense is responsible for the overall
supervision and control of the telecommunications sector, which mainly com-
prises Administracion Nacional de Telecomunicaciones (ANTEL), a decentral-
ized state-owned public utility. ANTEL has the monopoly for the provision
of all public national and international telecommunications services in
Uruguay. It is also responsible for the allocation and control of the radio
spectrum, and is authorized to license and control the operation of private
telecommunications services (where ANTEL cannot provide such services).
Radio and television broadcasting stations are licensed by executive decree
at the recommendation of ANTEL. The Ministry of National Defense operates
facilities required for its own organization, and additionally provides
point-to-point maritime services. Ship-to-shore services are provided by
ANTEL, and are linked to Uruguay's telecommunications network. The police
organization operates its own facilities which are generally not extended to
ANTEL's network. Until December 31, 1980, two subsidiaries of US companies
(International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation and Western Union Inter-
national) operated some international telegraph and telex services. ANTEL
has taken over the operation of these services on January 1, 1981 on the
termination of the franchises granted to these companies. Since ANTEL had
provided similar services before, it does not expect any difficulty in oper-
ating the additional traffic that was handled by these entities. ANTEL's
five-year investment programs, annual operation budget, tariffs, and organi-
zation structure and authorized posts are approved by executive decree at
the recommendation of Secretaria de Planeamiento, Coordinacion y Difusion
(SEPLACODI).
1.04      Domestic manufacture of telecommunications equipment and materials
in Uruguay is limited to minor items, and annual sales of such items to
ANTEL amount to less than 1 percent of ANTEL's capital expenditure.
Access to service
1.05      The telephone density in Uruguay (as of January 1979) averaged 9.6
telephones per 100 population, the highest in any Latin American country.
Annex 1 sets out international telephone statistics. Although about



- 2 -
74 percent of main lines 1/ were installed in Montevideo, the country had
about 340 exchanges operating in other cities, towns and villages; only
1.3 percent of villages with 201-500 inhabitants, and 12 percent of villages
with 200 inhabitants or less did not have telephone service. There are
about 1,400 local and long distance public call offices throughout the
country. On the basis of the total population of places with telephone
exchanges as a proportion of the country's total, more than 80 percent of
the country's inhabitants have access to this service. Ninety-two percent
of the main lines are connected to automatic exchanges. Currently about 30
percent of the long distance outgoing calls from Montevideo are subscriber
dialed, as are about 40 percent of those originating in the rest of the
country. Subscriber dialing is being gradually extended to cover more towns
and cities.
1.06      In Montevideo, about 22 percent of main lines are connected to
business and government offices, and the balance to residences, as shown in
the table below.2/  According to a stud C arried out by ANTEL, 7 percent of

these residential main lines are in areas of high average socioeconomic
level, 15 percent upper-middle, 56 percent lower-middle, and 22 percent low

somewhat higher averaging about 33 percent. New main lines are connected in

the order of receipt of applications subject to availability of exchange and
outside plant capacity. Overriding priority is, however, given to
government, hospitals, physicians and pharmacists; businesses and
professionals are given five years and three years antedate in priority,
respectively. Nonpriority applicants wait up to several years to obtain a
main line, depending on the exchange area. At the end of 1980 there were
approximately 63,000 outstanding applications for main lines (about
29 percent of total number of subscribers).
Quality of Service and Existing Facilities
1.07      In Montevideo, local telephone service is generally unreliable and
of poor quality, making it often easier to conduct business by traveling to
meetings rather than by telephone. Local service is severely congested; on
an average, probably only about one-half of local call attempts are
successful, and during peak business hours, congestion is worse.4/ Call
attempt failures are due to (a) called party being engaged (reflecting the
high per telephone usage due to insufficient main lines installed); (b)
insufficient traffic handling equipment at the exchange (resulting in
internal blockage); and (c) high failure rate of local exchange switching
equipment and of cable plant due to past neglect in maintenance. Due to
poor condition of the cable network, heavy rain brings about widespread
breakdowns. Repairs are often slow, and extended outages are common.
1.08      Long distance service is also congested.  Although about
80 percent of long distance calls succeed, this is largely due to the fact
that about 70 percent of this traffic is manually handled, calls being only
canceled after a number of attempts have failed. Average delay on ordinary
manual long distance national traffic is about one and one-half hours, and
on priority traffic (charged at twice the ordinary rate), about one hour.
The completion rate of international calls is about 72 percent and the
average delay of completed calls is about one and one-half hours; delays of
several hours are not uncommon.
1.09      In Montevideo the quality of calls once established varies
considerably but is often unsatisfactory. Noise, interruptions and
crosstalk are fairly common. In the interior, overall quality and
reliability of telephone service are acceptable.
4/ Based on about 24,000 call attempts made among test lines in Montevideo
exchanges, an average 33 percent failed due to insufficient traffic
handling equipment at the exchanges, faulty exchange equipment, or
faulty interexchange (junction) cables. This result, however, excludes
call attempts that fail due to called party being engaged and due to
cable network faults (other than in junctions). Reliable data for these
are not available. The 50 percent estimated average local call attempt
failure rate given above probably underestimates the severity of
congestion in local service. During peak hours generally the congestion
is much more severe.

1.10      Basic data on plant in service and usage of telephone, telex and
telegraph facilities in the period 1971-79 are set out at Annex 2.
Usage of Service
1.11      In Montevideo, nonresidential subscribers, comprising 22 percent
of the total main lines, originate about 40 percent of all calls and
generate about 48 percent of ANTEL's telephone revenue. These figures,
however, underestimate the use of telephones in relation to directly
productive activities. About 43 percent of calls from residential
telephones are made to offices and professionals, partly for business
related purposes. Furthermore, an unquantified proportion of calls among
residences are likely to be for business purposes to mitigate to some extent
the crippling effects of traffic congestion prevailing during office hours.
Overall, ANTEL estimates that about 60 percent of all calls made in
Montevideo relate directly to the productive and distribution activities of
the economy, and these account for about 70 percent of ANTEL's telephone
revenue.
Demand for Service
1.12      Expressed demand for main lines as of December 31, 1980 totaled
283,534 for the whole country, including 220,548 lines in service and 62,986
outstanding applications for new lines. Based on past long-term growth
trends of expressed demand, ANTEL forecasts that demand will total about
367,900 by end 1985--a 5.4 percent annual growth rate. The table below
gives actual and ANTEL's forecast levels of aggregate expressed demand for
and supply of main lines year by year for the period 1975-85.

However, a systematic procedure for periodically preparing and updating
area-by-area forecasts, and for reconciling them with the aggregate
projections, is not in use. It is thought that ANTEL's forecasts probably
underestimate demand since (a) it is too early for the historical trend data
to reflect the increased communications requirements of the changing economy
(see paragraph 1.02), and (b) the projections do not take into account the
impact on expressed demand of planned major increases in service
availability and quality.5/
1.13       By end 1980, the telex service had 900 subscribers and 400
applicants on the waiting list. The demand for telex in towns where service
was not available is not quantified. However, ANTEL expects total demand in
the country in 1985 to reach about 2,400--a 21 percent annual growth rate
over the current measure of expressed demand.
Sector Goals
1.1L4      The legislation whereby ANTEL was established 6/  in 1974
explicitly recognized telecommunications services to be essential. In a
cross-sectoral review of the country's progress and programs, 7/ the
Government in 1978 assigned a high priority to expanding telecommunications
services as required to meet the needs of all other sectors, and improving
quality through the substitution of aging plant. In this context, ANTEL's
efforts until 1985 focus on (a) major rehabilitation and expansion of local
telephone service in Montevideo, thereby attempting to greatly increase the
reliability and quality of service to present subscribers, while meeting most
of the current and forecast expressed demand; (b) continued modernization of
the long distance network, and automatization and expansion of telephone
operations in the interior, to decongest and expedite national services; (c)
bring international services rapidly up to modern standards; and (d) improve
ANTEL's organization and management towards becoming a viable and efficient
utility capable of undertaking increasingly large development efforts.
Attention is also given to expanding telex facilities to meet all demand in
areas currently served, and extend telex service to new areas of the
interior. These are adequate priorities given the state of Uruguay's
telecommunications services and the Government's directives.
1.15       ANTEL's 1981-85 investment program will bring the total number of
telephones in operation in Uruguay by end 1985 to about 476,300, or some
5/ Experience in several cities of the interior has confirmed the existence
of a considerable hidden demand which only materializes as service
availability and quality are perceived to be rapidly improving. This is
in line with the findings in other countries. Also total demand at end
1980 was 5.6 percent higher than forecast only a year earlier reflecting
a growth of 11 percent rather than the forecast 5.4 percent.

16 telephones per 100 population 8/ (compared with 13.0 in 1980). Over the
period 1981-85, the number of main lines will increase at 10.7 percent per
annum, well above the 2.7 percent per annum averaged over 1971-79. By end
1985 almost all of the demand for main lines which is currently forecast
(paragraph 1.12) is expected to be met, against 78 percent by end 1980. All
services will improve considerably, especially in Montevideo (where also
most of the expansion will take place), and international service in
particular will do so significantly. However, as service improves and
expands at a high rate relative to Uruguay's past achievements, actual main
lines demand and traffic are likely to outpace forecasts; ANTEL intends to
monitor the situation, and prepare the next five-year investment program in
the light of actual experience.
Sector Constraints
1.16      As a branch of the former Usinas y Telefonos del Estado (UTE),
telephone services in Uruguay reached a fairly advanced stage of development
in the mid 1930s. However, inadequate sector organization, shortage of
capital, import restrictions and other problems (many reflecting the
country's general economic difficulties) resulted in stagnation and
deterioration of these services especially from the mid 1950s. Following
the setting up of ANTEL in 1974, and a succession of major changes in the
country's economic policies, telecommunications operations have been
gradually developing administrative autonomy, as well as good relations with
regulatory entities in Government, as needed to run along sound utility
principles. Likewise, whereas until recently ANTEL was unable to generate
internally a reasonable proportion of the funds needed for expansion and
service improvement, the financial outlook is now improving (see
Chapter V). Hence, although further progress regarding both sector
relationships and finances needs to be pursued, ANTEL's development efforts
at least up to the mid or late 1980s will be mainly constrained by major
inadequacies in its own organization, management and staffing.
1.17      Separation from UTE and absorption of telegraph services and other
functions formerly the responsibility of other government services, was not
followed by a sufficient effort in reorganization. At present, ANTEL
reflects piecemeal attempts to put together a basic working entity out of a
scatter of units taken over by stages. There are also a number of
management weaknesses in terms of what is needed to run a modern utility.
Finally, mainly due to low salaries and inadequately structured salary
scales, there is a strong tendency for qualified staff to search for better
employment terms elsewhere, and ANTEL is unable to attract experienced
replacements where available, or to retain young university or technical
school graduates beyond the initial training period (see Chapter IV).

The Bank's Role
1.18      Except for a telephone component in a 1950 loan to UTE, the World
Bank has had no operations in the telecommunications sector of Uruguay. In
1975, the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) approved a loan
(No.282/OCUR) to ANTEL. During execution of the project, IDB experienced
problems with ANTEL in respect of (a) delay in project execution, (b)
organizational shortcomings, and (c) failure to collect Government bills.
The project's completion has slipped considerably as procurement was
delayed. ANTEL was required to retain consultants for procurement
assistance. The process for selection and retention of consultants is very
involved in Uruguay, and took considerable time. IDB staff consider the
work of the selected consultants as satisfactory, and the progress of the
IDB project as now good. The same consultants have now been retained by
ANTEL for procurement, and contract supervision for switching equipment and
the earth satellite station. Part of the former would be World Bank
financed under the proposed loan, and bid documents are ready. It is,
therefore, expected that the World Bank project would not encounter major
procurement problems. Organization shortcomings are expected to be overcome
by ANTEL's retention of consultants to attend to specific issues (see
paragraphs 4.02, 4.06 and 4.07).  With respect to improving collection of
Government bills, the Bank has laid down targets for ANTEL and the
Government to settle old bills, and will set out details of procedures to
assure timely payment of bills for services rendered after October 31, 1981
(see paragraph 4.18). The World Bank considered involvement in the
telecommunications sector in Uruguay in early 1980 after IDB indicated that
they had no plans for any further involvement in this sector, and that they
were considering projects in other sectors which suitably covered the
objectives they set out to pursue in Uruguay. The World Bank's current
lending strategy in Uruguay is centered on supporting directly productive
se!ctors of the economy and the infrastructure required for their efficient
operation, especially in the Montevideo metropolitan area and linkages to
the main interior cities and with other countries. The project proposed for
Bank financing, which focuses on the improvement and expansion of telephone
service in Montevideo and on the improvement of long distance and
in,ternational facilities (see Chapter II), is directly supportive of this
strategy.
1.19      The Bank's involvement in financing this project is justified in
terms of:
(a)  helping improve ANTEL's organization and management as
needed to run it along sound utility lines, and encourage
the adoption of salary levels and structure which may
enable the entity to recruit and retain qualified staff;
(b)  assisting ANTEL in attaining an adequate technical
solution (especially in the Montevideo multiexchange
area) at a time when choices on network structure and
switching technology must be made;



-8-
(c) reducing the cost of equipment and materials, by
extending use of international competitive bidding to all
imports, and by following Bank procurement guidelines;
(d) ensuring adequate tariffs for telecommunications
services, including a tariff level that permits the full
recovery of costs and generation of funds for investment
needed for expansion and improvement of services, and a
tariff structure which promotes economic efficiency in
the use of existing plant and in the allocation of new
resources;
(e) assisting ANTEL in planning subsequent stages of its
development, and ensuring an investment mix that is
responsive to the country's priorities expecially in
productive sectors; and
(f) providing long-term financing to help meet ANTEL's high
foreign fund requirements arising from the need for a
massive rehabilitation and expansion effort.
II. THE PROGRAM AND THE PROJECT
The Program
2.01      ANTEL has prepared a telecommunications development program for
the five-year (1981-85) period. This program mainly aims to increase the
number of main lines from about 221,000 in service at the end of 1980 to
about 366,000 at year-end 1985, an annual growth rate of about
10.7 percent. Besides this expansion of subscriber services in urban and
rural areas, the program provides for the installation of about 1,400
additional public call office telephones, most of these in the Montevideo
telephone area. The program is planned for execution during 1981 through
1985, and comprises the following main items:
(a) ongoing works for the installation of exchange equipment,
associated outside plant and construction of buildings;
(b) extension of the long distance network, and maritime
service;
(c) installation of telegraph and telex equipment;
(d) construction of ANTEL's new administrative building;
(e) renovating some existing switching equipment;
(f) preinvestment for the following (1986-90) program; and
(g) the project for Bank financing (paragraph 2.03).



- 9 -
Contracts for all works defined at (a) through (e) have been awarded. The
works at (a) and (d) are scheduled to be commissioned by December 1983; and
those at (b), (c) and (e) by end 1982. Annex 3 sets out a summary of
physical targets at end 1980, and end 1985. Annex 4 sets out the exchange
capacity, main lines, total telephones and outstanding applications at end
of 1979 through end 1985 yearwise. The map sets out the telecommunications
network.
2.02      The program is estimated to cost about US$302.9 million equivalent
inicluding a foreign exchange expenditure of about IJS$187.9 million
equivalent. Annual program costs from 1981 through 1985 are set out in
Annex 5.
The Project
2.03      The project proposed for Bank financing is a high priority
selfcontained part of ANTEL's 1981-85 development program. It provides for
a balanced and integrated development of all telecommunications services,
acddressing the sector's main goals (see paragraghs 1.14 and 1.15). It will
be carried out between 1981 and 1985, and consists of the following
installations:
(a) a total of about 208,800 lines of local automatic
telephone exchange equipment in Montevideo including the
replacement of about 99,000 lines of antiquated and fault
prone equipment; replacement of existing deteriorated
cables; and additional cables and telephones to connect
about 60,000 additional main lines;
(b)  a total of about 19,700 local automatic telephone exchange
equipment lines in the rest of the country, to replace
some manual exchange equipment, and to expand existing
automatic exchanges; and associated cables and telephones
to connect about 13,000 additional main lines;
(c) about 900 additional long distance circuits;
(d) a standard A earth satellite station;
(e) a combined national and international automatic exchange
with a total of about 4,200 terminations including
terminations for about 1,300 long distance and for about
900 international circuits;
(f) buildings to house equipment; and
(g) services of consultants to assist ANTEL in project
management and execution; and in the improvement of
organization, salaries, staff plan, maintenance,
financial management, and tariff studies.

Project Cost
2.04      The total cost of the project is estimated at about US$204.8
million, including a foreign exchange expenditure of about US$134.7 million
equivalent. Project costs which are shown in detail in Annex 5, are

1/  In addition to ANTEL's retention of consultants for project execution
(see paragraph 2.05), ANTEL has received proposals for consultancy
services in organization and personnel management (see paragraphs 4.02
and 4.06). ANTEL proposes to use the same consultants selected for the
above work to assist ANTEL in the areas of finance management and tariff
analysis (see paragraphs 3.11 and 4.10). According to past accounting
procedures ANTEL has included the cost of about US$2 million for the
retention of these consultants under general administration costs.
2.05      The project's foreign costs are based on estimated December 1979
prices which have been based on the experience of similar equipment procured
by other telecommunications organizations through international competitive
bidding, and then adjusted for inflation experienced and expected during
1980. Local costs are based on June 1980 prices. ANTEL has already



- II -
retained a firm of consultants to carry out procurement, construction and
supervision of local exchanges and of the earth satellite station. ANTEL
will use 242 manmonths of consultants for preparation of switching equipment
specifications, award evaluation, contracting, and work supervision; and 37
manmonths of consultants for similar work in connection with the earth
satellite station, at an average manmonth consultancy cost of US$4,500 plus
NUr$14,000. The project costs are reasonable. ANTEL is exempt from payment
of customs duties on imported goods, and of any other taxes on procured
goods.
Contingencies
2.06      Price contingencies included in project costs amount to 48 percent
Of the total of base and physical contingency costs. They result from the
estimated local cost increases of 40 percent per year; and the estimated
foreign cost increases of 9 percent in 1981, 8.5 percent in 1982, and 7.5
percent annually from 1983 through 1985. These contingency estimates are in
cccordance with the Bank's expectations for projects in Uruguay. For the
conversion of projected local costs into US dollars, the Uruguayan peso is
expected to be devalued against the US dollar by about 27 percent annually
(see note to Annex 5).
2.07      Except for variations in quantities which could occur in building
construction and civil works, and for which a physical contingency amounting
to 5 percent of local costs has been provided, no other physical
contingencies are necessary. Provisions of local exchange lines, long
distance circuits and of telephones are based on detailed engineering and
forecasts of equipment quantities. In the case of cable networks, the
dispersion of these networks throughout the system permits flexibility and
adjustments, which makes provision of physical contingencies unnecessary.
Items and Sources of Financing
2.08      Of the project's foreign cost of about US$134.7 million, the
proposed Bank loan would provide US$40 million; government would provide
US$40 million in foreign exchange (paragraph 3.08); the balance of about
US$54.7 million and the local cost of about US$70 million equivalent would
be provided through ANTEL's internal cash generation.
2.09      The items for Bank financing in US$ million are as follows:
Local exchange equipment    32.1
Telephones                      2.5
Long distance switching         2.3
Unallocated                     3.1
Total                    40.0
The Bank loan is assumed to be for 15 years, including three years of grace,
wii:h a 9.6 percent interest rate.



- 12 -
Procurement
2.10      All Bank-financed goods would be procured through international
competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's procurement guidelines.
None of the goods proposed for Bank financing are currently manufactured in
Uruguay. Local price preference in procurement is not, therefore, required
by the Government. Uruguay is a member of the Latin America Free Trade
Association (LAFTA), but since ANTEL pays no import duties, preference for
regional pact manufacture is not admissible. ANTEL proposes to obtain other
imported project goods through international competitive bidding, using its
own and Government funds. Other goods which are manufactured locally, like
outdoor line and telephone fitting materials, would be obtained through
local competitive bidding and financed by ANTEL's own funds. The
arrangement for local bidding permits competition and is satisfactory.
Project Implementation
2.11      The proposed schedule for project execution as set out in Annexes
6 and 7 (Chart WB-21912) is realistic. ANTEL's staff, with the assistance
of local consultants, has prepared engineering designs for all switching and
earth satellite station equipment. ANTEL has also prepared bid documents
and technical specifications for all other Bank-financed goods. Bids for
all these goods are expected to be invited by July 15, 1981. ANTEL would
contract with local companies to lay and joint all local distribution and
interexchange cables and would supervise the construction of all cable works
entrusted to these contractors. ANTEL would install all subscribers' equip-
ment. ANTEL's technical staff would assist contractors' staff in the in-
stallation of transmission equipment, of the earth satellite station, and of
new and sophisticated types of switching equipment. Building extensions to
house project equipment will be designed and supervised by ANTEL's staff and
will be constructed by local contractors. ANTEL's management, together with
assistance from consultants, is capable of carrying out this project satis-
factorily. The project is scheduled for completion by December 31, 1985.
Disbursements
2.12      The estimated disbursement schedule is set out in Annex 8.
Disbursements would be made for 100 percent of the CIF cost of the imported
equipment and, where applicable, the foreign costs of its installation. All
disbursements would be completed by June 30, 1986.
Performance Indicators
2.13      Indicators which would assist in monitoring ANTEL's project imple-
mentation and operational and financial performance are set out in Annex 9.
These indicators have been discussed and agreed upon during loan negotia-
tions. ANTEL would include these indicators in the quarterly project pro-
gress reports sent to the Bank for the period ending December 31 of each
year.

III. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
3.01      The following economic analysis refers to the whole of ANTEL's
1981-85 telecommunications investment program, of which the proposed
Bank-financed project comprises the major part.
Program Size and Composition
3.02      The size of ANTEL's 1981-85 investment program falls short of what
can be justified a priori from the economic viewpoint, namely replacement of
antiquated and fault prone plant and meeting promptly outstanding applica-
tions for service and new demand expected to arise during the program period
(see paragraph 1.12) and prepare for the following investment project. The
high economic rate of return very conservatively estimated for the program
(see paragraphs 3.13-3.15) supports this impression of underinvestment in the
sector. However, given ANTEL's institutional limitations (see Chapter IV),
and the complexity of massive plant rehabilitation, the size of the program
proposed to be carried out by ANTEL, together with consultants' assistance,
is considered to be about the level that ANTEL can prudently undertake.
3.03      Within this limitation, the program addresses both replacements and
other improvements to current subscribers, and expansion of facilities.
Approximately 99,000 lines of automatic telephone exchange equipment will be
substituted in Montevideo, leaving only about 20 percent of exchange capacity
with more than about 20 years in service. Similarly, after replacing much of
the fault prone parts of the city's cable network, only 15 percent of it
would have been in use over 20 years. Some 7,200 lines of manual telephone
exchange capacity in the interior will be substituted by automatic equipment.
Congestion on long distance service will be greatly reduced, and speed and
reliability of this service improved considerably, by introduction of sub-
scriber long distance dialing in another 25 exchanges in the interior of the
country, increasing the number of long distance circuits, and introducing a
new combined national and international automatic telephone exchange.. The
latter, and provision of a standard full size earth satellite station, will
considerably improve the availability and quality of international services.
All this will result in an improvement of service quality and reliability to
current subscribers, in lower maintenance costs, and in higher effective
traffic leading to larger benefits and telephone revenues. Also, approxi-
mately 120,000 additional main lines will be connected in Montevideo, and
26,000 in the interior, which would meet most of the currently outstanding
and conservatively projected demand until end 1985 (see paragraph 1.12).
Some 1,400 telex lines will be added probably meeting demand up to 1985,
including that in cities not currently served (see paragraph 1.13).
3.04      In general, this balance between service improvement and expansion,
between Montevideo and the interior, and among types of service, is at this



- 14 -
time reasonable and consistent with good engineering practice.9/ In the
course of project execution, however, several matters should be taken up
with ANTEL and built into the preparation of the post 1985 investment
program. In particular, a detailed economic analysis must be carried out of
(a) the tradeoffs between replacement and expansion in Montevideo; (b) the
priorities for automatization, provision of subscribers long distance
dialing and expansion among places in the interior; and (c) the size of the
overall share of investment allocated to the interior as compared with
Montevideo. Given the fact that ANTEL will move towards more generally
satisfying forecast demand, the need for such an analysis will assume
increasing significance.
Distribution of Benefits
3.05      The approximately 90,000 main lines of current Montevideo
subscribers that will benefit from exchange equipment rehabilitation are
likely to be distributed by economic sectors as shown in the table below.

The distribution of the approximately 63,000 outstanding applications for
connections, most of which will be made by 1983, is very similar to that of
the ensemble of current subscribers. Assuming that the approximately
120,000 main lines to be connected in Montevideo under the 1981-85 program
9/ An exception is the rebuilding (to be completed in 1981) of some old
telephone exchange equipment. This was an urgent temporary relief
measure for Montevideo undertaken before the more comprehensive 1981-85
program was developed. Similarly, a small (type B) earth station was set
up in 1980 (US$2.2 million equivalent, not in the 1981-85 program) which
will be replaced in 1983 by the full size station included under the
project.



- 15 -
will be likewise distributed as are current main lines,10/ the benefits of
expansion of Montevideo's telephone and total telephone investment in this
city will reach the various economic sectors as shown in the table above.
3.06      Congestion of local, long distance and international telephone
service, especially during office hours, will be greatly reduced. Although
by 1985 the proportion of nonresidential main lines is expected to be
similar to what it is at present, the proportions of calls generated by them
(currently 40 percent in Montevideo), and of revenues (48 percent), are
likely to increase significantly once office-hour congestion is reduced.
The already high total proportion of telephone calls and revenues which
relate directly to economic production and distribution functions is there-
fore expected to increase even further. Thus, whereas the rehabilitation
and expansion would at first sight seem to apply to mostly residential
users, the value of which will at least partly reflect social uses, in fact,
the investment will be primarily supportive of economic activities.
3.07      In addition to its use in supporting participation in the economy,
improvement and expansion of residential telephone service should generally
enhance the quality of life. Based on the distribution of current unmet
residential main line applications in Montevideo by average socioeconomic
levels of the population in the respective areas of the city, it can be
expected that about 79 percent of new residential main lines will be made in
areas of low and lower-middle socioeconomic level, 15 percent in uppermiddle
and 6 percent in high-income residential areas.  This is close to the
distribution of existing subscribers (paragraph 1.06).
3.08      Over the period 1981-85 approximately US$126.8 million will be
collected and transferred to Government in the form of an 18 percent value
added tax levied on telecommunications services. Furthermore, financial
projections indicate that ANTEL will be able to pay a contribution to
Government of US$15.0 million in 1985 (see paragraph 3.10).1l/
10/ The differences among these distributions are minor. For example,
residential main lines account for 77.6 percent of all current
Montevideo lines, 77.5 percent of all currently outstanding applications
(based on a sample of 13,700 applications), and 78.8 percent of the
applications received in the last one and one-half years, which are
likely to better reflect the composition of forthcoming applications
(sample size 5,200).  Residences account for 80.0 percent of current
main lines to benefit from exchange equipment replacement. Differences
may be relatively larger for smaller categories.
11/ If current demand forecasts prove conservative, however, these funds may
be needed for preinvestments for the program starting 1986.

Tariffs
3.09      A summary of ANTEL's present tariffs is given at Annex 10.  The
domestic tariff level decreased in real terms from 1976 to 1978, but
increased at about the rate of inflation thereafter:
Cost of  Domestic  International
Date         Living    Tariffs    Tariffs 1/
12/31/76         1.00        1.00        1.00
12/31/77         1.57        1.26        1.41
12/31/78         2.30        1.68        1.86
12/31/79         4.21        2.89        2.23
06/30/80         5.05        3.63        2.40
i/  The increase of international tariffs has
been lagging behind inflation since 1979
due to the government policy of lower
devaluations of the NUr$ than the
difference between rates in local and
international inflation.
Adequate legislation and procedures exist which have generally in the past
resulted in prompt correction of domestic tariffs for local inflation and
international tariffs for devaluation of the NUr$. Such adjustments
currently take place several times per year. In 1980 the average revenue
per subscriber will equal about US$300, or about US$360 if the 18 percent
value added tax is included.
3.10      The Government's stated policy is to keep ANTEL's tariffs at a
level that produces enough revenues to cover ANTEL's operating cost and
provides an adequate contribution to expansion of the telecommunications
sector.  In 1977-80, however, the rate of return has only averaged about
5 percent (see paragraph 5.02), which has been insufficient to provide an
adequate contribution to expansion. In case funds are generated in excess
of ANTEL's needs, Government can require ANTEL to pay a contribution to
Government for its general expenditures.12/
3.11      ANTEL's tariff structure is in line with current practice in other
developing countries. Initial charges and rentals differentiate among types
of subscribers (i.e., residential, professional and others--mainly business
and government), long distance call charges are reduced at nighttime and on
weekends, and subscriber dialed calls are priced lower than similar
operator-assisted calls, all of which is satisfactory. However, the
relationship between the costs of providing the various services and the
'111 1e 4,55C3 ofi 1A\91 6 .



- 17 -
corresponding tariffs has been distorted over time due to inflation and
inadequate adjustments, and the cost structure will undergo change as ANTEL
introduces new technology. These and other considerations 13/ point to the
need for ANTEL to revise its tariffs. The emphasis of such a review should
be on improving the value of market signals to further direct existing plant
usage and new investment towards economically efficient use of resources.
This would be in line with general government policy regarding pricing of
public utilities. Accordingly, during negotiations ANTEL agreed to carry
out a review of, and propose any necessary changes to, its tariffs, mainly
i-a terms of marginal production costs and demand characteristics, subject to
meeting the entity's financial performance requiremnents and taking into
account equity considerations and other general objectives set out in the
Government's development policies. An outline of such a study is set out at
Aninex 11. As a condition of effectiveness of the proposed loan, ANTEL
agreed to assign staff and/or retain consultants with qualifications and
terms of reference acceptable to the Bank to carry out the tariff study.
ANTEL also agreed to submit to the Bank by October 31, 1982 for comments (a)
the results of such study, including any recommendations for changes in
tariff structure and level, and (b) an action plan to implement these
chianges. Within six months of receiving the Bank's comments, ANTEL will
carry out all actions required on its part to put into effect the action
p]an as proposed or as amended in agreement with the Bank. During
negotiations, the Government agreed to do whatever is necessary on its part
to ensure the implementation of the action plan within the given time
framework.
Least Cost Solution
3.12      The configuration of ANTEL's existing network and its targets of
expanding and improving service within the 1981-85 five-year telecommunica-
tions plan (see paragraphs 1.14 and 1.15) limit the number of viable
alternative solutions to comply with those targets. The dimensioning and
timing of works under the 1981-85 program of which the Bank project is an
integral part, are based on engineering studies designed to determine-the
least cost solution for each work. ANTEL's proposed replacement of fault
prone and antiquated equipment in Montevideo is a step in the right
13/ The "professionals" tariff category, which applies to the residences of
doctors, nurses, etc., is an unnecessary refinement since it applies to
only about 3 percent of main lines. The unit call charge (i.e., per
local call in excess of the number included in the monthly rental) at
NUr$0.20 (2 US cents) appears to be low, especially given that service
is heavily congested (i.e., resulting in high production and opportunity
costs per completed call). There is no time differentiation for local
calls, as would be useful to encourage a shift of some types of traffic
(mainly residential) to off-peak hours. The connection fee plus
reimbursable deposit required for new lines, while sufficiently large
(US$240 to US$290) to have some rationing effect on demand (which is
desirable while ANTEL catches up in meeting demand), is in this sense
probably of little effect since it can be paid on easy credit terms.



- 18 -
direction. Efficiency of service in a multi-exchange network as in
Montevideo, depends on the efficiency of its weakest links. By eliminating
the sources of weakness, telephone service will be significantly improved.
Given existing telecommunications technology, the program as a whole, which
will include the introduction of electronic digital switching, represents a
least cost solution to comply with ANTEL's five-year plan targets.
Return on Investment
3.13      The internal financial rate of return (defined as the discount
rate which produces a zero net present value of incremental cash flows) of
ANTEL's 1981-85 investment program is 24 percent (see Annex 12).
3.14      As from June 1, 1980, a value added tax of 18 percent was included
in ANTEL's bills. ANTEL acts as the Government's tax collection agent and
the tax is not included in ANTEL's revenues. No decrease in observed demand
was noted when the tax was introduced. With the 18 percent tax included in
the benefits stream as a minimum estimate of the amount users are willing to
pay for telecommunications services over and above ANTEL tariffs, a minimum
estimate of the economic rate of return of the 1981-85 program is 30 percent.
3.15      These rates of return understate the benefits to be derived by
users from the investment program. Partly this arises from the fact that
users are willing to pay for the telephone service considerably more than
ANTEL's tariffs plus value added tax. For example, under severe telephone
traffic congestion, users incur a considerable cost in time spent attempting
to call, and possibly also in business inefficiency resulting from the long
delays in completing calls. In at least some parts of the country, poten-
tial subscribers have been found willing to pay immediately the full invest-
ment cost of new telephone main lines in order to get them promptly. The
demand for houses and offices with a telephone in Montevideo is considerably
higher than for those without a telephone. Also, spare capacity to be
installed under the 1981-85 program will be utilized at later times to
expand service or increase traffic capacity at low additional investment
cost. None of these related additional benefits have been incorporated in
the calculation of the rate of return.
Risk
3.16      The project offers limited risk.  The principal risk is the pos-
sibility of delayed physical implementation due to unforeseen circum-
stances. Since this project comprises a relatively large number of partly
independent activities, delay in the completion of a few works would not
generally prevent the use of other newly created assets. Further, costs and
benefits of telecommunications projects tend to be delayed in roughly the
same degree so the impact on the rate of return may not be significant. A
sensitivity analysis on the financial rate of return (in Annex 12) indi-
cates that a combination of 10 percent higher capital cost, 10 percent
higher operating costs and 10 percent lower revenues, would result in an
i'aternal financial rate of return of not less than 17.5 percent.



- 19 -
Environmental and Health Prospects
3.17      No significant adverse environmental or health effects are
expected from the project. As the project would provide better telecommuni-
cations services, the growth of vehicular traffic congestion during business
hours in larger urban and suburban areas could be reduced somewhat for a
given level of overall communication activity, particularly in Montevideo,
accompanied by a reduction in the growth of atmospheric pollution. Further-
more, better telecommunications could result in the better utilization of
transport for movement of food, medicines and patients in emergency
s:ituations.
IV. THE IMPLEMENTING AGENCY
Organization
4. 01     ANTEL is managed by a three-member Board of Directors appointed by
the Government, one of which is the entity's chief executive (President) and
legal representative. In 1980, at the Bank's suggestion, day-to-day manage-
ment functions were separated from policy and top management responsibili-
ties, and vested on a general manager appointed by Government at the recom-
mendation of ANTEL's Board. ANTEL's regulations 14/ have been accordingly
modified in 1980 in a way which allows for all the delegation of authority
to the general manager necessary for efficient management. In practice, the
reassignment of responsibilities has proceeded at a good pace.15/
4.02      The new general manager supervises the work of four divisions--one
each for operations, planning, finance, and administration. Each division
is headed by a manager with other supporting staff. ANTEL's current main
organization chart is set out at Annex 13 (Chart WB-22179) and is similar to
that in other developing countries. The complete organization structure,
however, has not been formally approved by Government, which earlier turned
down two proposals from ANTEL on the grounds that they were not supported by
adequate analysis of the entity's specific needs. Currently, each of the
division's responsibilities are not clearly defined, job descriptions for
individual staff within the divisions are not laid down, and there are no
prescribed service standards nor norms for sanction of staff. ANTEL lacks
in-house expertise and manpower to overcome these problems, to permit it to
embark on a sustained large-scale improvement and expansion of services.
ANTEL has, therefore, agreed to employ consultants for a period of one year
14/ Reglamento General de la Administracion Nacional de Telecomunicaciones
(ANTEL). Decreto No. 233/977, May 3, 1977.
15/ The general manager, the secretary general, the chief legal adviser, and
the manager for the Radio Spectrum Administration Division, all report
directly to the Board, and the general manager attends board meetings on
a regular basis.



- 20 -
to (a) review ANTEL's organization structure, and recommend any changes
needed, (b) prepare job descriptions and qualification requirements for all
posts, including a clear definition of main lines of divisional and individ-
ual staff responsibilities, and outline in detail those responsibilities
that should be delegated to the general and division managers, and (c)
obtain a decision from ANTEL's Board on the performance standards to be met,
and thereafter draw up a system to record events and to monitor them and
work out the staff requirements in each category involved in the work.
Broad terms of reference for the consultants are set out at Annex 14.
Assurances have been obtained that (a) ANTEL will retain such consultants
before loan effectiveness; (b) by June 30, 1982, send the Bank for comments
the consultants' findings and recommendations on all these matters; (c) by
October 31, 1982 propose a plan of action including a timetable to put into
effect the recommendations after obtaining the Bank's comments; (d) begin on
March 1, 1983 to carry out the plan of action; and (e) by February 28, 1984
complete the action.
Staffing
4.03      As of January 1, 1981 ANTEL's telecommunications staff totaled
about 7,400, of whom about 6,500 were utilized in the operation of the
telephone services. With ANTEL operating about 286,700 telephones, the
staff ratio was about 23 per 1,000 telephones. This is reasonable consider-
ing the large number of long distance open wires in operation which need
comparatively large number of maintenance staff, and the manual operation of
long distance services, which utilizes about 1,500 telephone operators.
When the long distance service is automatized during the project period, and
obsolete and fault prone plant is replaced, the staff ratio will fall to
about 15 per 1,000 telephones beyond 1985 and thus labor productivity will
increase significantly. The staff to telephones ratio will be monitored in
the performance indicators (paragraph 2.13).
4.04      Although ANTEL suffers from organizational and management inade-
quacies (see paragraph 1.17), its higher level engineering, planning and
operations staff are individually qualified, generally competent, and are
experienced in project management. Given proper and clear-cut job descrip-
tions (see paragraph 4.02) and a staffing plan (see paragraph 4.06), ANTEL
would be able to efficiently manage the considerably expanded operations
resulting from the project. ANTEL's finance and management staff are also
generally qualified and capable.
4.05      Annex 15 sets out the number of ANTEL's employees by type of
function, and the pay groups as of June 30, 1980 and as planned for December
1985. About 86 percent of the staff draw salaries of less than US$235 a
month. The bulk of the middle-level technicians and engineers draw less
than US$700 a month. The salary levels are generally low compared to those
prevalent for similar occupations in the private sector and in some other
public enterprises. Furthermore, the salary structure is unsatisfactory.
It is based on "points" for each type of post (each point's current value is
NUr$4.Y5) and te-re- are about 70 ailierent "points" Yevels.  StaiE are not
awarded any salary increments unless they move to a different job with a



- 21 -
h-igher "points" level--which for most staff is not a normally available
option. Hence in practice staff salaries remain fixed almost indefinitely
(except for inflation adjustments).
4.06      Partly because of the inadequate salary level, ANTEL has been
unable to attract and retain sufficient experienced personnel. When
recruitment has been effected, the "points" system has effectively pegged
salaries, and is likely to have been a major disincentive for staff to con-
tinue working for ANTEL after gaining initial training and experience in
ANTEL. Qualified staff leave for better positions in Uruguay or in neigh-
boring countries (mainly Argentina and Brazil), while others regularly hold
additional jobs. The latter lowers morale and productivity, as such staff
do not pay full-time attention to ANTEL's service requirements. There is,
therefore, urgent need to establish a staffing plan with specific recruit-
ment targets for all levels and types of staff, together with a program for
salary increases, which would make it possible to implement the staffing
plan. ANTEL has agreed that the consultants to be retained to assist in
i,mproving the organization (see paragraph 4.02) would also recommend salary
levels and structures and establish a plan for the recruitment, training,
and career development of staff at all levels. Draft terms of reference are
at Annex 14.
4.07      In the context of this organization, salaries and staff plan
improvements to be undertaken with the assistance of consultants over a
period of more than one year, a list of posts expected to play key roles in
the implementation of the 1981-85 program and operation of services has been
drawn up (Annex 16). ANTEL concurs with the list but has also decided to
supplement it with other posts. ANTEL has agreed that the consultants
should prepare job descriptions and qualification requirements, and recom-
mend salary levels and scales, for these key staff within the first three
months of their contract.  ANTEL has also agreed to decide on these
recommendations after consultation with the Bank and have all key posts
staffed and appropriate remunerations in effect not later than three months
after receipt of the Bank's comments on these recommendations.
Training
4.08      ANTEL operates a center which trains telephone technicians,
transmission equipment maintenance staff, and outdoor plant skilled labor.
During 1979, ANTEL trained a total of about 550 staff in a total of 75
courses. Annex 17 sets out details. Switching and transmission equipment
staff are additionally given on-the-job training during installation of
equipment. Since the number of main lines will increase considerably during
the project period, ANTEL will have to recruit a large number of outdoor
plant maintenance staff. ANTEL has drawn up plans to strengthen the train-
ing effort to ensure timely availability and adequacy of trained outdoor
maintenance staff. Engineering staff needed to maintain exchange plant
would be trained at the suppliers' factories, and during equipment installa-
tion, under the contracts for purchase of Bank-financed exchange equipment.
T'rained maintenance staff would thus be available when project goods are



- 22 -
commissioned. These arrangements are adequate. There are, however, no
courses in the areas of administration, accounting and management. Assur-
ances have been obtained from ANTEL that courses satisfactory to the Bank in
the above areas would be added in the training center by December 31, 1982.
Maintenance
4.09      Maintenance is at present unsatisfactory.  The number of faults is
very high (the records do not give a precise picture), averaging about
10,000 at any one time in Montevideo, and the duration of these faults is
also excessive--about 700 main lines continued to be faulty for over one
month. ANTEL has agreed that the consultants to be retained in connection
with organization, salaries and staff plan (paragraphs 4.02 and 4.06), would
also draw up procedures for the maintenance of existing equipment and cables
and for monitoring their applications (Annex 14). Performance targets on
fault incidence and duration have been agreed upon (Annex 9).
Accounting
4.10      ANTEL's accounting system functions relatively well, but certain
routines should be improved. On the Bank's recommendations, steps were
taken to change procedures, e.g., accounting for stores and fixed assets
(see paragraphs 5.08 to 5.10). Consultants (Arthur Young & Co.) prepared in
1975 detailed recommendations for improvements in the areas of accounting
and financial management of Usinas y Trasmisiones del Estado (UTE, formerly
Usinas y Telefonos del Estado) before ANTEL was completely separated from
the power operations. A local consultant is now reviewing the applicability
of these recommendations in ANTEL. During negotiations ANTEL agreed as a
condition of loan effectiveness to send to the Bank a copy of the report of
the consultant's diagnosis, and based on this report, prepare an action plan
by October 31, 1982 with specific implementation dates. The action plan
will be carried out so that results are reflected in ANTEL's financial
statements for FY83.
4.11      Many accounting routines, which currently are done manually, could
be done more efficiently by computer. ANTEL currently lacks suitable staff
for systems analysis, programing and the running of a computer center. As
from December 31, 1981, UTE will no longer be able to handle ANTEL's comput-
erized routines (mainly billing, see paragraph 4.14), and ANTEL is therefore
in the process of employing suitably qualified staff to form a computer
center of its own. ANTEL has indicated that they may require outside
assistance for the formation of this center and for the acquisition of a
suitable computer. Properly computerized routines would improve the
efficiency of ANTEL's accounting.
Audit
4.12      ANTEL's accounts are by law audited by a government agency,
Tribunal de Cuentas de la Nacion. Detailed procedures for this audit were
agreed on under a previous project financed by the Inter-American
Development Bank (see paragraph 1.18). These audit procedures and resulting



- 23 -
audit reports appear satisfactory. The Bank's experience of audits in UTE
by Tribunal de Cuentas de la Nacion, however, has been less satisfactory.
4.13      ANTEL's 1977-78 audited financial statements were finalized more
than a year after the end of its fiscal year, partly due to problems related
to the separation of UTE and ANTEL. The situation has improved lately and
FY79 audited statements were available in September 1980.  During negotia-
tions, assurances were obtained that auditors satisfactory to the Bank will
be appointed and that in FY81 and FY82 ANTEL will supply the Bank with its
financial statements within six months of the end of its fiscal year and
corresponding audit reports within two months thereafter. From FY83 onwards
ANTEL will supply the Bank with audited financial statements within six
months of the end of its fiscal year. The Bank's supervision mission visit-
ing Montevideo will check on the quality of audit staff in the government
agency, and would decide if this agency meets with Bank's standards.
Billing and Collection
4.14      ANTEL's subscribers are billed monthly on UTE's computer (IBM
370).16/ Bills normally reach the subscribers within one month after the
End of the billing period, and they are normally paid (except for bills to
Government) about one month thereafter. If the bill is not paid within the
period stated in the bill, the amount due is included in the bill of the
following month and, in case of nonpayments after reminders per telephone
and telegram, ANTEL proceeds to disconnect the subscriber (except for
Government). ANTEL's accounts receivable in NUr$ millions as of December
31, 1979, were as follows:
Official   Private   Total
Value in balance sheet                        62.8      108.6    168.4

Average period of collection (months)         13.3        2.9       4.5
^- These adjustments under "Official" refer to bills for tele-
communications services of government subscribers not paid
for in cash, but in form of other services (NUr$15.7 million,
mainly electricity from UTE) according to the government
established compensation mechanism. The value of these other
services are booked under current liabilities in ANTEL's
balance sheet. The net amount owed by foreign administra-
tions to ANTEL for international calls is NUr$18.1 million.
16/ In September 1980, UTE informed ANTEL that it would need all computer
capacity only for UTE's routines as from December 31, 1981. This means
that ANTEL has to develop urgently its own computer capabilities (see
paragraph 4.11).



- 24 -
4.15      Some of the government accounts receivable date from 1977 and
earlier. Since January 1, 1977, domestic tariffs have been increased by a
total of about 260 percent to compensate for the effects of inflation and,
therefore, the actual collection period for bills to government is much
longer than the 13.3 months indicated above. If government accounts receiv-
able are calculated at the average tariff level of 1979, the collection
period would be over 18 months. In December 1979, Government paid an amount
of NUr$10.2 million towards the bills for 1977 and earlier years. During
1980, however, Government has fallen further behind with its payments, and
as of December 31, 1980 Government accounts receivables amounted to about
NUr$79 million.
4.16      As from June 1, 1980, a value added tax (VAT) of 18 percent was
included in all ANTEL's bills. The tax amounts collected were paid by ANTEL
to the fiscal authorities within established time limits. ANTEL was,
therefore, financing the tax payment for amounts billed to government
subscribers, in addition to the loss in real value of accounts receivable
due to inflation and delayed payment. On the Bank's suggestion, a system
has been created to eliminate the adverse effects of VAT on ANTEL's finances
(Finance Ministry decree dated April 3, 1981).
4.17      Contributing to the government arrears problem, in many cases
reorganizations and movements of government agencies have not been
adequately recorded by ANTEL to ensure that correct subscribers are billed.
Some government subscribers delay payment of their bills arguing that in
part they are billed for telephones that are not used by them. This issue
was discussed with ANTEL's management and it was agreed that ANTEL would
begin in 1980 a program to verify the listings of telephones for government
subscribers to ensure correct billing as from mid 1981. Dues for past bills
will be adjusted accordingly.
4.18      In order to deal with the situation, it was agreed with ANTEL and
the Government that by September 30, 1981, and as a condition of
effectiveness, 50 percent of all lines relating to overdue accounts of the
public sector as of July 31, 1981 would be identified and reconciled, and by
December 31, 1981 similar action would be taken for the remainder of these
lines as of October 31, 1981. The Government undertook to pay these
accounts not later than June 30, 1982, and to pay for bills for services
rendered after October 31, 1981, if not paid by the public sector within 75
days of their billing to the sector.
Insurance
4.19      ANTEL has insurance coverage for buildings, internal plant and
stores against fire and special perils. Insurance protection is also main-
tained for vehicles, for cash in transit, and personal liability. These
arrangements are satisfactory.

V. FINANCES
Introduction
5.01      Inflation in Uruguay averaged about 50 percent per year in 1977-80
and ANTEL's tariffs and wages increased roughly at the same rate. The
values of fixed assets were adjusted during a 1977 inventory, and revalued
(see paragraph 5.08) annually thereafter to compensate for inflation.
Exchange losses on foreign loans have been capitalized (loans financing work
in progress) or charged against income (loans not financing work in prog-
ress) to reflect the devaluation of the Uruguay peso (NUr$) against most
major currencies. Comparison of financial results between different years
is, therefore, difficult with such distortions of ANTEL's financial perform-
ance. To facilitate the understanding of ANTEL's financial performance as
presented in this chapter, financial statements are given in current US
dollars (see Annex 18, paragraph 1) instead of Uruguay pesos. Financial
projections for 1981-85 are also in current US dollars, which is in accord-
ance with ANTEL's own practices.
Financial Performance
5.02      ANTEL's income statements for 1977-80 are given in Annex 19.1 and
notes and assumptions in Annex 18. A summary in US dollars (millions) is
given below:
Fiscal Year Ending December 31:  1977   1978   1979   1980
Operating revenues                 36.2   41.2   51.7   80.2
Operating costs                    28.2   32.1   40.1   66.6

Operating ratio                    78      78      78     83
1/  Rate of return defined as operating income over
average revalued:  (a) net fixed assets in operation
plus current assets and (b) net fixed assets in
operation.
5.03      According to a Ministry of Economy and Finance decree, ANTEL's
tariff level is set as to produce a certain return on average revalued net
fixed assets in operation plus current assets, a procedure which is also
used for other public utilities (e.g., UTE). Under the 1975 IDB project
(see paragraph 1.18), an 8 percent rate of return on this basis was agreed
Oll. The application of this covenanted return was postponed, however, until
the end of 1981, when long distance and other equipment financed under the
IDB project are expected to be brought into service. Government now intends



- 26 -
to reach agreement with IDB not to apply this covenant as this would be
against current policies.
5.04      ANTEL's tariffs have been increased roughly at the same rate as
its operating costs (see paragraphs 3.09 and 3.10), and this has permitted
ANTEL to maintain a rate of return of about 5 percent on average revalued
net fixed assets in operation plus current assets (equivalent to a rate of
about 7 percent on average revalued net fixed assets in operation), and an
operating ratio of about 80 percent. This tariff level has, however, not
permitted ANTEL to generate adequate funds for its expansion programs. A
tariff increase in real terms of 4 percent was, therefore, authorized in
February 1981. Further tariff increases will be needed periodically,
however, to ensure adequate cash generation to carry out ANTEL's investment
program.
5.05      During negotiations, assurances were obtained from Government that
during the period 1982-85 tariffs will be maintained at a level to permit at
least 50 percent during any one year (and 60 percent for the whole period)
of total capital expenditures to be provided from internal sources. As from
1986, the contribution to expansion from internal sources would not be less
than 60 percent. Beginning in December 1981, tariff levels will be reviewed
not less frequent than each six months to ensure that the contribution to
expansion is maintained at this level and if necessary steps would be taken
to raise tariffs.
Financial Position
5.06      ANTEL's balance sheets for 1977-80 are given in Annex 19.2 and
notes and assumptions in Annex 18. A summary of ANTEL's position in
millions of US dollars as of December 31, 1980, is given below:
Fiscal Year Ending December 31, 1980:         Revised Budget

Less current liabilities  21.6    7%           56.4      17

Total Liabilities                          323.9    100



- 27 -
5.07      ANTEL has a strong financial position with only 19 percent of
total capitalization in long-term debt. The current ratio of 3.8 may be
exaggerated considering that overdue government bills (see paragraph 4.14)
are included in current assets, and net fixed assets may be overstated (see
paragraphs 5.08 to 5.10). Furthermore, minor adjustments of asset values
may be required due to the separation of UTE and ANTEL. The status of the
separation of UTE and ANTEL was reviewed during negotiations, and ANTEL will
proceed with the separation according to the timetable set out under the
fifth power project for UTE.
Valuation of Fixed Assets
5.08      At the request of IDB, ANTEL completed an inventory and revalua-
tion of its fixed assets as of December 31, 1977. The 1977 inventory is
detailed and the revaluation reasonable. On the whole, this work has
provided a good basis for subsequent annual revaluations, which are being
made according to the average increase in cost of living and the exchange
rate for the US dollar. So far, this procedure has produced acceptable
results, and ANTEL intends to continue revaluing its fixed assets annually
on the same basis.
5.09      During the 1977 inventory, new useful lives for ANTEL's fixed
assets according to the time estimated for remaining useful lives of
existing assets were established. For example, in the case of exchange
equipment, a useful life of 40 years was established. Depreciation rates
based on this useful life were applied to assets acquired after 1977, as
well as those existing in 1977. It was pointed out by the Bank that these
useful lives lead to low annual depreciation charges as compared with
practices adopted by most telecommunications entities. To avoid
overstatement of operating income and equity, ANTEL's depreciation rates had
to be reviewed. This was discussed with ANTEL's management, which took
necessary action to adjust depreciation rates and residual values for assets
put into service after 1979.
5.10      In 1977-80 ANTEL transferred work in progress (WIP) to assets in
operation after a period of up to one year after final acceptance of each
work.  In many cases, equipment had been in use for two years or more before
such transfer occurred. Depreciation on these assets was, therefore,
delayed and the capitalization of interest and exchange losses continued for
far too long a period. ANTEL's management has taken action to change
procedures as from 1981 and to transfer WIP to assets in operation as soon
as the equipment is accepted for service.
P?roject Financial Performance
5.11      Financial projections for 1981-85 are given in Annex 20:1 and
notes and assumptions in Annex 18. A summary in current US$ millions is
given below:

1/  Rate of return defined as operating income over average:  (a)
total assets, excluding WIP and (b) net fixed assets in operation.
2/ Defined as: internal cash generation after debt service
(excluding capitalized interest), less increase in working capital
other than cash, divided by capital expenditures for the year.
5.12      The financial projections are based on a tariff level, which would
produce a rate of return of about 8 percent on average revalued net fixed
assets in operation plus current assets. For the financial projections,
fixed assets revalued by 8 percent peiryear (see Annex 18, paragraph 14),
which is expected to fairly reflect the impact of inflation on ANTEL's
assets. Over the project period the resulting revenues are expected to
allow ANTEL to contribute at least 60 percent of capital expenditures from
internally generated funds (see paragraph 5.05).
5.13      At the end of the project period in 1985, ANTEL is expected to
have a current ratio of 2.9, a long-term debt equal to 20 percent of total
capitalization and a balance in cash and banks of about US$6.8 million.
Projected financial results and financial position at the end of the project
period are satisfactory.

5.15      According to the financial projections, ANTEL's debt service ratio
will not fall below 2.7 during any one year of the project period and ANTEL
will contribute 63 percent of its requirements for capital expansion from
internally generated funds, which is satisfactory. Of total requirements
(including increase in working capital), ANTEL will generate internally
66 percent, the World Bank loan will finance 12 percent and other sources
will provide 22 percent. The proposed Bank loan would be made to ANTEL for
a term of 15 years including 3 years of grace (standard terms for Uruguay)
at the current Bank rate, assumed to be 9.6 percent for the purpose of
financial projections.



- 30 -
5.16      The Government and ANTEL will negotiate a commercial bank loan of
about US$40.0 million which is expected to provide for better terms than
could have been obtained without Bank involvement. If this additional
financing, however, is not obtained, the Government would undertake to make
necessary funds available to ANTEL. When the additional loan is obtained,
the Loan Agreement would be amended to include (i) a "cross-default" clause,
and (ii) a skewed amortization schedule so that uniform semiannual amortiza-
tion payments would amortize both loans. An agreement would also be entered
into between the World Bank and the commercial bank substantially in the
form of earlier Bank agreements with commercial banks. Assumptions on loan
terms for financial projections are given in Annex 18, paragraph 19.
VI. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01      During negotiations, agreement was reached that ANTEL will:
(a)  send to the Bank by October 31, 1982 for comments a
tariff study and related action plan, and implement this
plan within six months of receiving the Bank's comments
(paragraph 3.11);
(b)  send to the Bank by June 30, 1982 for comments , the
consultants' recommendations on organization, salaries,
staff plan and maintenance; send by October 31, 1982 a
proposed plan of action, taking into account the Bank's
comments, towards implementation of these
recommendations; and commence its execution by March 1,
1983 for completion by February 28, 1984 (paragraphs
4.02, 4.06 and 4.09);
(c)  discuss with the Bank the consultants' recommendations on
key posts and implement these recommendations including
the staffing of all key posts not later than three months
after receiving the Bank's comments (paragraph 4.07);
(d)  establish training courses on administration, accounting
and management by December 31, 1982 (paragraph 4.08);
(e)  on the basis of the financial consultant's findings send
to the Bank by October 31, 1982 an action plan and
implementation schedule and carry these out, so that the
results of the improvements are reflected in ANTEL's 1983
financial statements (paragraph 4.10);
(f)  appoint auditors satisfactory to the Bank; submit to the
Bank its financial statements for 1981 and 1982 within
six months of the end of the year and corresponding
reports witnin two months thereaiter; aa& as irom 1)'S,



- 31 -
submit financial statements to the Bank within six months
of year end (paragraph 4.13); and
(g) by September 30, 1981, reconcile overdue accounts for
50 percent of public sector lines as of July 31, 1981 and
take the same action for the balance as of October 31,
1981 not later than by December 31, 1981 (paragraph 4.18).
6.02      During negotiations, assurances were obtained that Government
would:
(a) maintain tariffs at a level as to produce funds from
internal sources equivalent to at least 50 percent of the
capital expenditures incurred during any one year of the
1982-85 period and at least 60 percent for the whole
period; as from 1986, the contribution to expansion from
internal sources would be not less than 60 percent
(paragraph 5.05);
(b) act promptly on changes in tariff structure indicated by
the tariff study to be undertaken by ANTEL and/or its
consultants (paragraph 3.11); and
(c) pay by June 30, 1982 all identified and reconciled debts
from public sector lines and subsequently pay any public
sector bills that remain outstanding 75 days after
billing date (paragraph 4.18).
6.03      As a condition of loan effectiveness, ANTEL will:
(a) assign staff and/or retain consultants with
qualifications and terms of reference acceptable to the
Bank, to carry out the tariff study indicated in
paragraph 6.01(a);
(b) hire consultants under terms of reference acceptable to
the Bank, to provide the services indicated in paragraph
6.01(b);
(c) send to the Bank a report on the review referred to in
paragraph 6.01(e); and
(d) have complied with paragraph 6.01(g) in respect of the
first 50 percent of public sector lines.
6.04      The proposed project constitutes a suitable basis for an IBRD loan
of US$40.0 million equivalent for a term of 15 years including a 3-year
grace period.

FIRST TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
Tariff Study
Draft Terms of Reference
1.        The purpose of the study is to develop the principles which should
guide formulation of an appropriate structure and level of tariffs for
telecommunications services in Uruguay, apply these principles to the
analysis of ANTEL's present tariff structure and level, and recommend any
necessary changes to be implemented from 1983 or earlier.
2.        The basic approach to establishing an appropriate tariff structure
will be that of marginal cost pricing, with the constraint that overall
revenue generation must be sufficient to ensure full cost recovery and
generation of an adequate proportion of the funds needed for service
expansion and improvement. Marginal cost may take two forms:
(a) cost to the telecommunications entity of providing addi-
tional supply;
(b)  cost to existing or potential users of doing without the
service, where capacity is insufficient to meet the demand.
Thus the study has to have both a cost accounting and forecasting dimension
and a demand assessment dimension, as well as a financial analysis to assess
the adequacy of revenues generated from the point of view of financial
viability. The study should also consider equity and other general objec-
tives of government policy.
Cost Accounting
3.        The purpose of this part of the work is to identify the marginal
costs of the principal different telecommunications services offered, dis-
tinguishing between Montevideo, major towns of the interior, and the rest
of the country:
(a) provision of telephone connection;
(b) telephone calls by subscribers
- local calls
- long distance calls
- international calls;



- 46 -
ANNEX 11
Page 2 of 3 pages
(c) calls by users of public telephones, and same categories
to the extent applicable; and
(d) telex, and same categories to the extent applicable.
Such costs will be specified in 1982 values.
4.        The base of the calculations will be:
(a) financial accounts of the enterprise;
(b) operating records of the enterprise;
(c) expectation of cost variations in the future including those
resulting from the introduction of new technology and, in
particular, from the project;
(d) spot-checks to establish on a sample basis the marginal
costs of particular services; and
(e) relevant data available from other telecommunications
administrations.
Demand Assessment
5.        The purpose of this part of the work is to assess the character-
istics of demand for each of the different services offered by the telecom-
munications entity, and the sensitivity of that demand to the prices which
might be charged. This is needed for two purposes: (a) in order to
estimate the cost to users (or potential users) of doing without the service,
for cases where it is not possible to meet demand fully; and (b) in order
to identify those services which are in least elastic demand (i.e., demand
will be least affected by price changes), so that they should be made to
bear the major part of any mark-up necessary to cover overheads and enable
the telecommunications entity to attain overall financial viability.
6.        This work will require thorough review of existing records on
applications for service, calling rates, ineffective calls, etc., supple-
mented by surveys of a sample of existing and potential users in order to
deepen knowledge of demand for the different services and of the amounts
that customers would be prepared to pay for the different services (or that
they would suffer as losses, or extra expenses, if the services were not
available).



- 47 -
ANNEX 11
Page 3 of 3 pages
Social and Developmental Considerations
7.        Attention must be given, in connection with the demand assessment,
to the possible need to charge certain incipient users, e.g., services in
distant rural areas, or public call offices, at rates below those that would
be indicated by marginal cost and financial viability considerations, as a
means to stimulate socially highly desirable use. Certain limited cross-
subsidization of this nature may be a worthwhile means of bringing telecom-
munications facilities within the reach of development centers and poorer
people who would otherwise be excluded.
Financial Analysis
8.        The. approximate tariffs for the different services (some of which
may turn out to need to be cost-based while others may need to be more
demand-based) must then be multiplied by estimated levels of service require-
ments to assess total revenues for 1982 and the following  years.   These
should be compared with updated projections of costs, to assess the future
financial status of the enterprise.
9.        Iterations may be required in order to produce a structure of
tariffs that is consistent with financial viability.
Final Results
10.       The results of the study should be a recommended set of prices
for the various services, with alternative possibilities where appropriate,
and projections of the effect of application of such prices on the enter-
prise's revenues and financial performance. Recommendations should also be
made as to how the tariffs should be adjusted over time in light of changes
in costs including inflation.
Resources Required
11.       The study will require approximately six to eight weeks each of
effort on the part of an economist, a financial analyst and an engineer, all
with experience in telecommunications, and supplemented by the necessary
staff to assist with survey work.

FIRST TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
Rate of Return on Investment Program
1.        ANTEL's 1981-85 investment program includes the project, ongoing
and other works and preinvestments for subsequent program (1986 onwards).
The close interrelation between the project and works outside the project
makes arbitrary any attempt to separate incremental costs and revenues for
the project from the non-project components of the program. The rate of
return calculated in the following paragraphs therefore, refers to the whole
of ANTEL's 1981-85 investment program, excluding only preinvestments for sub-
sequent programs (US$4.5 million in 1985). This rate of return is also
representative for the Bank project.
2.        All components for the rate of return calculations are expressed
in current US dollars and the values of incremental cost and revenue streams
have been deflated by an accumulative 10% per year as from the base year
1980 to reflect dollars of constant purchasing power.
3.        The benefit period extends from 1982 to 2005, when on average the
equipment provided under the program is expected to have substantially com-
pleted its useful life. No residual values of programmed investments have
been taken into account as the 1980 present value would be insignificant.
4.        As from 1986, operating costs and revenues related to the program
are assumed to remain constant in real terms. Incremental revenues are
based on projected increase in telephone and telex subscribers and consequent
traffic increases attrlbutable to the program. ANTEL's telecommunications
facilities are currently so congested that no significant traffic increases
can be handled without programmed investments. Operating costs are based on
additional assets and traffic generated under the program, excluding depre-
ciation and interest.
5.        Operating cost and revenues for equipment replaced under the
program have been included in the rate of return calculations in proportion
to the number of direct exchange lines replaced:

Thc cost and revenue streams above result in a rate of return of 23.6%.
7.        A sensitivity analysis was performed with the following results:
(a)  10% increase in capital expenditures                   21.2%
(b)  10% increase in operating costs                        22.9%
(c)  10% decrease in revenues                               20.3%
(d)  combination of (a), (b) and (c) above                  17.5%
8.        The economic rate of return should be substantially higher than
the above 23.6% due to the following:
(a) no attempt has been made to estimate the consumer surplus.
It is known, however, that in spite of current poor quality
of service people are prepared to pay substantially higher
prices for flats and offices with telephone than for those
without telephone. With projected improvement of the quality
of service, the surplus should increase, and;
(b) no increase in net revenues attributable to the 1981-85 invest-
ment program have been considered after 1986. Some of the
equipment to be installed has, however, ample spare capacity
and could handle substantially higher traffic volume with
inexpensive marginal investments. Therefore, the full benefits
will not be obtained before facilities are expanded under
subsequent programs.

9.        As from June 1, 1980, ANTEL collects an 18% value added tax, which
is included in ANTEL's bills but not in its revenues. No reduction in demand
for telecommunications services has been noted after the introduction of this
tax. The inclusion of the tax in the benefit stream for the rate of return
calculation would produce a 29.5% rate of return, which would constitute a
minimum estimate of the economic rate of return for the program.

FIRST TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
Consultants--Terms of Reference
A. Definition of an Organizational Structure with Clearly Established
Lines of Responsibility and Job Description
1.        The current organizational structure is generally along the lines
of similar organizations in other countries. The consultants should review
the complete structure and recommend any changes needed to ensure that
ANTEL can handle efficiently its rapidly growing investment and operating
responsibilities. In particular, the consultants:.should consider the addi-
tion of an organization and methods unit and a fundamental planning unit
neither of which exist at present.
2.        The fundamental planning unitis functionshould mainly be to (a)
identify and quantify the future telecommunications needs of the country
based on the Government's plans for economic development and other relevant
information; (b) develop long-term policies, objectives, strategies, and
priorities of telecommunications services to meet these future needs;
(c) prepare broad long-term plans to attain these objectives; (d) assess
the resources (human, material, financial) needed to reach the development
targets and prepare plans for their availability; and (e) guide management
on investment, pricing and technical innovation decision.
3.        The fundamental planning unit would include among other things
the in-house expertise required on a permanent basis to provide economic
inputs to ANTEL's management in connection with investment and pricing
policy. Implementation of the unit would be fixed in such a way that it
would with the initial assistance of appropriate consultants, if necessary,
carry out economic analyses which are necessary for the preparation of ANTEL's
next investment program.
Responsibilities
4.        Clearly defined responsibilities for the general and division
managers are required to be laid down. Where decisions involve interdivi-
sion coordination and consultation, a system for such consultation may have
to be prescribed. Further responsibilities for the staff working under each
Of thLe d:Lv%ioQ. ma.a%e. m    s   t4&3MLs.   t  -2 ti <Se          -------
managers need to be defined. Below this level, an outline of job descriptions
should be prepared for further detailing and finalization by division managers
in consultation with the general manager.

ANNEX 14
Page 2 of 4 pages
Delegation of Responsibilities
5.        So far, ANTEL's Board od Directors has been deeply involved in
ANTEL1s day-to-day operations. With the appointment of the general manager
to whom some powers have already been delegated, the Board of Directors
should be relieved of nearly all routine matters, and the general manager
together with the division managers should be delegated all powers necessary
to carry out day-to-day operations, within established policies without
further reference to the Board. The consultants would list out which
powers should be delegated to, and exercised by, the general and divisional
managers. ANTEL's Board would thus be enabled to devote more time to policy
matters; and to relations with the Government, the public, and other national,
regional or international telecommunications organizations.
B.. Establishment of Performance Objectives
Performance Indicators
6.        ANTEL's Board would lay down service standards, e.g., (a)
time to answer on manual board operations; (b) average number of faults
per substation per year; (c) average fault duration; (d) booking to delivery
time for telegrams; and (e) average time to instal telephones after receipt
of request for service. These are only representative items. ANTEL could
prepare a list depending on its own perceived weaknesses and the relative
urgency for eliminating them.
7.        Based on the above, the consultants would draw up a system to
record events and to monitor them, work out the staff 1/ requirements (ineach
category involved in the work), the qualifications of staff, and basis of
recruitment. As far as possible, division managers should be able to
recruit the requisite number of staff (after staff standards and recruitment
rules are defined), arrange for their training, and placement as soon as the
assets they have to maintain are installed or the work they have to do is
required to be attended to.
C. Analysis of Salary and Benefits
Key Personnel
8.        A list of posts likely to play key roles in the implementation of
the 1981-85 investment program and operations is attached. Some of these
posts have been filled while the others would be filled during project execu-
tion. ANTEL has concurred with the listed posts, and based on its
1/ Some of the categories of staff for whom standards are required to be
prescribed, are indicated in these terms of reference.



- 54 -
ANNEX 14
Page 3 of 4 pages
local knowledge, has decided to add a few more posts to the list. Staff
in these key posts should have adequate experience when recruited, and should
be offered sufficiently good employment benefits to attract them. Further
to retain these and other staff for reasonable periods of time, scales of
pay with annual merit increases should be prescribed. The present "points"
system for fixation of salary, and future uncertainty of staff moving up to
the next higher "points" posts, is a disincentive for staff to continue with            *
ANTEL.  Not only should Lhe level of salaries be fixed on the prevailing
market conditions, but grades (and scales of pay to suit) should be pres-
cribed. Further to administer the salary structure efficiently, the number
of grades should be as few as possible consonant with the qualifications,
and experience needed for each grade. Currently, the low level of ANTEL's
salaries, and the limitations imposed by the "points" system, recruitment
of adequate staff is becoming more difficult, and when recruitment is accom-
plished, the younger recruits leave ANTEL (or take other jobs in addition)
after gaining valuable experience within ANTEL. While priority has to be
given to action on key personnel staff benefits, so that such staff are in
position  during the early phases of project execution which period needs
careful and close attention, the situation of salaries and benefits for all
ANTEL staff should be analyzed, and a plan prepared to improve these to
attract and retain other staff. A recruitment and training plan should
also be drawn up, in such a manner that the more important positions get
prior attention for recruitment and stage by stage training.
D. Establishment of Norms and Maintenance Procedures
Maintenance
9.        Due to past lack of attention to maintenance and the difficulty
in recruiting qualified staff, the maintenance standards are unsatisfactory.
In addition to monitoring of performance, procedures for maintenance should
be laid down. ANTEL's management should receive information at stated
intervals of the quality of maintenance and service offered to the sub-
scribers.
E. Other Items
10.       Whilst the consultants are working on the study proposed under
A through D above, they will also review the following points in each
department, and make suitable recommendations to improve efficiency:
(a)  objectives being pursued (theoretical and real);
(b)  appropriateness of available resources (personnel, organi-
zation, equipment and installations), giving attention to
the number and abilities of staff, hours of work, suit-
ability of the organization and distribution of authority
and responsibility and other factors that may influence the
performance of the department.

(c) management, administration, and technical systems (budget
and logistic information; planning; supply and contracting
of services; control of execution; recruitment and develop-
ment of personnel; security norms; operation and maintenance
of equipment; communications; flow of documents; files; etc.).
F. Timing
:Li.      The implementation of the recommendations at E will, after consult-
ations with the Bank, be completed from December 1982 through December 1983
according to a timetable satisfactory to the Bank. Since recruitment and
retention of key personnel is urgent, the consultants should complete this
part of the assignment within three months of contract signature, to enable
ANTEL to take a decision within six months of retention of consultants, and
to recruit staff during the early part of the project's execution. Recommenda-
tions for items A, B and D should be-progressively made through June 1982, to
enable ANTEL to decide on them through September 1982.
G. Jobs Requiring Fixation of Norms
1. Operators (telephone)
2. Operators (telegraphs)
3. Cable jointers
4. Outdoor repair staff
5. Outdoor installers

Notes and Assumptions to Financial Statements
Income Statements
1.        All 1981-85 financial projections have been made in current US
do[Llars, with an expected annual dollar inflation of about 10% in operating
costs. The revenue projections are based on the October 1, 1980, tariff
level and US dollar rate. Tariff adjustments needed to produce an 8% rate
of return on average revalued net fixed assets in operation plus current
assets have been shown separately.
2.        Local and metered telephone traffic has been increased in pro-
portion to expected average number of subscribers with exception of the
est:imated metered long-distance traffic, which is expected to increase 5%
per year in 1981-83, 40% in 1984, when the STD equipment and expanded long-
distance facilities are expected to be in service, and 25% annually as from
1985.
3.        Manual long-distance, telephone traffic is expected to increase
only 5% annually, as the major increase is expected to occur in the STD
traffic, when facilities are made available.
4.        International telephone and telex traffic is expected to increase
25% in 1981, 20% per year in 1982-83, and 30% in 1984 when the earth satel-
lite station is expected to be in service, and 20% annually thereafter.
5.        Other revenues are expected to increase about 20% annually in
1981-85.
b.        Domestic telegraph traffic is expected to increase in the same
proportion as domestic long-distance traffic. International telegraph
traffic is expected to increase in the same proportion as international tele-
phone and telex traffic up to 1983 and remain stable thereafter, due to
expanded telex facilities.
7.        Costs for traffic operation are expected to increase 10% annually
in 1981-83 and remain stable thereafter, due to expanded STD facilities.
8.        Maintenance costs (including currently high spare parts costs) are
expected to increase 10% annually in 1981-83 and remain stable thereafter, as
antiquated equipment is replaced and new equipment requiring less spaue parts
and materzal for maintenance are put into service.

9.       Administrative costs are expected to increase 12% annually in
1981-85. Costs for management consultancy totalling US$2.0 million are
included in 1981 and 1982 costs. This is in line with ANTEL's past procedures.
10.       In connection with the 1977 inventory of fixed assets, new useful
lives were established for depreciation purposes. These lives are longer
than those currently estimated by most telephone companies (e.g., 40 years
for exchanges as compared with a normal 20 years). Therefore, ANTEL will
reduce the expected useful life for fixed assets put into operation as from
1979, resulting in the following average depreciation rates: 2.8% in 1980,
3.5% in 1981, 4.0% in 1982 and 4.5% thereafter.  According to ANTEL's pro-
cedures, additions during one year are not depreciated until the following
year.
11.       Interest for loans financing WIP is capitalized.  Other interest
is charged against income. For conditions of long-term debt see paragraph
19 below.
12.       Exchange losses for loans financing WIP are capitalized.  Others
are charged against income.
13.       Other nonoperating items consists mainly of costs and revenues
for allocations of radio frequencies.
Balance Sheet
14.       ANTEL revalues its fixed assets in operation and 1977-80 assets
values as well as depreciation thereon include revaluation adjustments. In
the 1981-85 projections revaluation adjustments have been estimated at 8%
per year, except in 1981 for which a 4% revaluation has been assumed. (In
FY81, ANTEL is expected to change procedures for transfer of WIP to assets
in operation and review depreciation rates, see paragraphs 5.08-5.10.
For projection purposes, these changes have been assumed to result in a
lower revaluation rate in FY81).
15.       ANTEL transfers work in progress (WIP) to assets in operation
after delivery and completion of a work, which in many cases mean that
equipment may be working for two years before the transfer occurs. Pro-
cedures are being changed as from 1981 to transfer WIP to assets in operation
in connection with the provisional reception of a work. In the 1981-85
forecast, WIP accumulated during one year is expected to be transferred to
assets in operation at the end of the following year.
16.       Receivables are expected to equal three months of billings as from
1981.
17.       Stores are expected to increase abtout  S7la in 19%O-9S3 die to the
high level of capital works during that period. In 1984-85, stores are
expected to be reduced to about 1980 levels.

18.       Other current assets are expected to increase about 15% annually
in 1981-85.
19.       ANTEL's long-term debt contracted before December 31, 1980, con-
sists of the following loans:
- BID, No. 282/OC-UR as of 1975, US$28.4 million, interest 8%
and commission 1.25% to be paid semiannually, repayment
and interest payments in 31 half-yearly instalments starting
November 1982;
- EULABANK, as of August 26, 1979, US$35.0 million, interest
1% over LIBOR until start of repayment and 1 1/8% over LIBOR
thereafter, grace period 48 months and repayment in 13 half-
yearly instalments thereafter; and
- Suppliers Credits, in various currencies totalling the
equivalent of US$27.0 million as of December 31, 1980,
interest averaging 6%, principal projected to be repaid with
10% in 1980, 20% in 1981 and 17.5% in 1982-85.
- For the purpose of 1981-85 financial projections, ANTEL is
expected to obtain Bank loan and cofinancing on the following
terms: Proposed IBRD loan, US$40.0 million, interest 9.6%
repayment in 15 years including three years of grace; and
commercial bank loans (cofinancing) interest 12.0%, repaid as
IBRD loan.
:20.      Other current liabilities are expected to increase about 15% annually
in 1980-83 due to the increased investment program. In 1984-85 a reduction to
1980-81 levels is expected.

1/  In 1984-85, telephone traffic is expected to increase to a level as to permit a decrease in tariffs
in dollar terms, still maintaining an 8% rate of return on revalued net fixed assets in operation
plus current assets. If project execution is delayed two years, however, tariffs would have to be
maintained at a higher level during the project period (see Annex 20:4).
2/ On revalued fixed assets.
3/ In 1985, ANTEL is expected to generate funds in excess of its requirements for operation and
expansion and a contribution to Government of US$15.0 million has been projected (compare para-
graph 3.10). If current demand forecasts prove conservative, these funds may be needed in 1985 for
preinvestments for the investment program starting 1986.
4/ Rate of return defined as overatinR income over average; revalued:
(a) net fixed assets in operation plus current assets;
(b) net fixed assets in operation.

for the period 1982-85 is about 70%. If the 1985 capital construction is
increased by US$15.0 million for subsequent investment programs (Annex 20:1,
footnote 3), the contribution to expansion for the 1982-85 period would be
66%.

FIRST TELECONMUNICATIONS PROJECT
Sesitivity Analysis to Show Effect of
a Two-Year Delay in Project Execution
1.        The analysis is based on the following simplyfied assumptions:
- procurement of equipment projected for 1981-85 will be
delayed one year and commissioning will be delayed
another year;
- investment as from 1986 (1986 price levels) will be about
US$40.0 million annually;
- projected revenue increases due to new subscriber equip-
ment, STD and international facilities will be delayed by
two years; and
-  costs for operation and maintenance will continue
by 10% annually up to 1985, due to continued manual operation
and delayed replacement of antiquated equipment.
2.        A summary of financial projections based on above assumptions is
given below in US$ millions:
