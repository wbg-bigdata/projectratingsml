PREFACE
1.        This report covers the first telecommunications project of
Administracion Nacional de Telecomunicationes (ANTEL) of Uruguay supported by
Loan 2033-UR. The loan for US$40 million to ANTEL was signed on
September 9, 1981, became effective on March 23, 1983, and was clo.sed on
June 30, 1989. In January 1987, the loan amount was reduced to US$24 million
and the undisbursed balance of US$2,294,900 was canceled.
2.        Parts I and III of the report were prepared by Bank Staff based on
information available in Project files and information supplied by ANTEL.
3.        The Borrower was requested to give its perspective of the design,
implementaticn and development impact of the project. A letter from ANTEL,
mainly stating its views on project implementation, is incorporated in Part II
of the report.

FIRST TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
(LOAN 2033-UR)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Obectives
The First Telecommunications Project to Uruguay, Loan 2033-UR, was
made to support ANTEL's program for the modernization and expansion of the
national telecommunication services during the 1981-85 period. The main
objectives of the prnje-t were: (a) major rehabilitation and expansion of the
local telephone service in Montevideo; (b) modernization of the long distance
networ': and international services; and (c) improvement of ANTEL's
organization and management.
Im-lementation Experience
Early actions to prepare documentation for procurement progressed
reasonably well in 1981-82 when the project was being appraised and the loan
approved. However, because of the subsequent financial crisis in Latin
America as well as in Uruguay, the commercial credits, which were required to
supplement the Bank's loan allocation for telephone switching equipment did
not materialize.  Therefore, the switching equipment was procured by a
suppliers' credit and the Bank loan was reallocated to finance cables and
other project items for which other credits were not available. With the
Bank's agreement, ANTEL then procured the telephone switching equipment taking
into account price and financing terms. These changes and reallocation caused
delays in project implementation totalling nearly three years. Subsequent
procurement also suffered from some delay, mainly due to procedural problems,
particularly the complex legal requirements in Uruguay.   The project was
substantially completed by December 1989, fo-Ar years behind the original
schedule.
Results
Although considerably delayed, the project's physical targets were
ultimately achieved, especially the modernization of the switching network by
digitalization and the establishment of an earth satellite station for
international communications. As the result of a study by management
consultants, ANTEL was able to make some improvements in its organization as
well. The financial position of ANTEL went through ups and downs, depending
upon the timing and extent of tariff increases to keep up with high and
variable inflation rates. Similarly the accounts receivable--mainly for
services to Government and its agencies--fluctuated depending on the
periodical settlements that were made by Government with the Lank's
intervention. On the whole, ANTEL improved its financial performance during
the actual implementation period of the project. ANTEL met the covenants in
the loan agreement, although compliance in some instances was substantially



- iii -
delayed.   There was a definite improvement towards the end of the project
period in the timely audit of ANTEL's accounts and submission of agreed
reports to the Bank.
LesonsLearind
The sudden impaet of the 1982 financial crisis in Uruguay, as well
as in the whole of Latin America, and the lack of commercial credits 1/ for
the major project components could not be foreseen at appraisal. In
hindsight, the full funding of the project probably should have bean finalized
before loan negotiations. However, the Bank's participation in assisting
ANTEL to overcome the fi..ancing problem through the use of suppliers credits,
taking into consideration both price and financing terms was innovative and
lessons were l_arned for future application in other projects. The record on
institutional development is also mixed, but for reasons mainly beyond the
control of ANTEL's management.  The Bank's continuous dialogue and insistar-l
on compliance with the financial covenants related to cash flow, particularly
tariffs and accounts receivable, facilitated ANTEL's finances in a difficult
period. The Bank's further involvement in this sector is being considered as
a part of a planned Public Sector Reform loan, which would aisist a move
towards greater private sector participation in ANTEL.
1/   At project appraisal in 1980, commercial credits were easily available
for other projects and no problems were foreseen for this project.

Sector              Industry
Sub-sector          Telecommunications
2.   Background
2.1.      The Ministry of National Defense is responsible for the overall
supervision and control of the telecommunications sector, which mainly
comprises Administracion Nacional de Telecommunicaciones (ANTEL), a state-
owned public utility.  ANTEL had the monopoly for the provision of all public
national and international telecommunications services in Uruguay, during the
Project period.  Recently, however, ANTEL has -  mitted the operation of a
private company providing cellular telephones in Uruguay.
2.2.      Except for a telephone component in a 1950 loan to the
Administracion Nacional de Usinas y Trasmisiones Electricas (UTE), a
government power supply company which before ANTEL's creation was also
responsible for the public telecommunication service, the Bank has had no
operations in the telecommunications sector of Uruguay. A Bank mission in
October 1979 identified the first telecommunications project which was
appraised in October 1980. Negotiations were held in Washington in May 1981,
and Board approval was obtained in July 1981.
3.   Project Objectives and Descrigtion
Project Objectives
3.1.      The project's objeclives were based on Government's own objective
for the telecommunications sector--that it meet the needs of all other sectors
and improve quality through the replacement of ageing plant. In this contoxt
ANTEL's efforts were focused on: (a) major rehabilitation and expansion of
the local telephone service in Montevideo; (b) continued modernization of the
long-distance network to decongest and expand national services; (c) bringing
internatioual services to modern standards; and (d) improving ANTEL's
organization and/management towards becoming a viable and efficient utility
capable of undertaking increasingly large and complex development programs.
3.2.      Project DescriRtion:  The project as appraised comprised the
following components:



-2-
(a)  installation of about 208,800 lines of local automatic telephone
exchange equipment in Iaontevideo including replacement of about
99,000 lines of antiquated and fault-prone equipment; replacement of
existing deteriorated cables, and provision of additional cables and
telephones to connect about 60,000 additioral main lines;
(b)  installation of about 19,700 local automatic telephone exchange
equipment lines in the rest of the country, to replace some manual
exchange equipment, and to expand existing automatic exchanges, and
associated cables and telephones to connect about 13,000 additional
main lines;
(c)  about 900 additional long-distance circuits;
(d)  a Standard A earth satellite station;
(e)  a combined national and international automatic exchange with a
total of about 4,200 termiiiations for about 1,300 long-distance and
about 900 international circuits;
(f)  buildings to house equipment; and
(g)  services of consultants to assist ANTEL in project management and
execution; improvement of organization, human resource development,
maintenance al... financial management; and tariff stud;. s.
Prolect Desien and Organization
4.        The project was designed within the framework of ANTEL's 1981-85
telecommunication investment program as a self-contained package. It thus
included those investment comporents which were expected to be initiated and
completed in 1981-85. In addition, consultant assistance was provided for the
institutional strengthening of ANTEL. The original design and organization of
the project were appropriate considering (a) ANTEL's evolving organizational
capacity, particularly its lack of in-house expertise and manpower to
undertake large-scale development plans; (b) the need to introduce modern
switching technology and network structure in its local and long-distance
telecommunications system; and (c) ANTEL's need for technical assistance for
organizational and financial improvement.
5.  Proiect Implementat'on
5.1.      Loan Effectiveness:  The original effective date in the loan
agreement was January 12, 1982. There was considerable delay in the
fulfillment of one condition of effectiveness, relating to the appointment of
management consultants, resulting in five extensions up to March 31, 1983.
ANTEL faced difficulties in signing the contract for the management study,
which was financed from ANTEL's own resources. In early 1982, Arthur D.
Little (USA) was selected to carry out this study, but ANTEL's top management
was replaced in March 1982, and the new Board wanted to review the award
decision because of the large amount involved (over US$1 million). After long



-3
deliberation, the contract was finally signed in November 1982, and the loan
became effective on March 1983.
Project Start-uu Procurement
5.2.      ANTEL initially made good progress ir, preparing bid documents for
the telephone switching equipment for Montevideo, the main component of the
project. The bids were received in December 1981, soon after the loan was
approved in September 1981. The bids were evaluated by a technical committee
made up of five ITU experts and their report was submitted to ANTEL in
September 1982. The cost of this equipment war estimated at $65 million and
out of this amount the Bank loan sa to finance US$32.0 million; the remaining
qum was to be funded by commerciai sources. However, because of the
substantial amount of the contract and the deterioration o- -he sconomic
situation in the region, no commercial bank finanr-ing was forthcorlng. At the
same time, ANTEL's Board felt that it could obtain favorable supplier credits
for the whole switching package and possibly also negotiate a commitment by
the supplier or supplying country to buy Urugusyan export goods. As a result
of a dialogue between ANTEL and the Bank, it was agreed that the Bank funds
should be reallocated for other items in the project, provided the contract
conditions for the switching equipment were reasonable. ANTEL finally awarded
the contract in November 1984 to the Brazilian subsidiary of L.M. Ericsson
(Sweden) at a cost of about US$87 million, about three years behind the
appraisal schedule.2/ The loan was reallocated in view of the changed
financing arrangement for the switching equipment and the amendmentt to the
original loan agreement were finally approved by the Bank's Board in June
1985.
ImRIementation
5.3.      The original implementation of the project provided for completion
of the project by December 31, 1985. As a result of the developments
indizated above, a revised implementation schedule was prepared with the
project completion target re-vised to December 31, 1988, three years behind the
original schedule. Procurement action on the project items proceeded without
major problems, although the process was slow. In December 1986, the loan
amount was reduced from US$40 to US$24 million due to the cancellation of the
telex and data expansion and reduction in the number of public telephones and
some savings in costs of cables. Because of canstraints on public sector
investments, ANTEL was forced to postpone the telex and data expansion and to
reduce the number of public telephones. The growth of FAX and private
telephones had reduced the temand for te'ex and public telephones. Moreover,
the bids received showed lower than expected cable prices, thus reducing the
amoxmt allocated in this category. Project execution improved significantly
froit 1987 and all the components of the amended project were completed by
_Z/ The change from military to civilian Government in 1985, which meant the
new Government then wanted to review the award, also contributed to the
delay.

one year behind the amended schedule.
Prjiect Coot&
5.-*.     The estimated project cost at appraisal was US$204.8 million with a
foreign exchange component of US$134.7 million. The revised estimated cost is
placed at US$217.5 million I/ (Table 5A) with a foreign exchange component
of $110.0 million. The foreign costs are about 19X less than appraised
(includlx,g contingencies) since the price of equipment did nct escalate as
provided under contingencies. There has been a very substantial increase of
about 531 in local costs. Tshis may partly be due to the inclusion of the
capitalized exchange losses during the implementation period. Overall che
project cost increased only by about 61 which is reasonable considering the
prolonged implementation period of the project.

5.5.      The disbursement schedule of Loan 2033-UR is given in table 3A of
Part III. Due to the delay o'I nearly three years in the resolution of
problems relating to procurement of switching equipment and ultimate
cancellation of the amount initially allocated for telephone switching
equipment under Category (1) (para 5.2) and subsequent reallocation, there was
no disbursement until 1986.  The origiial  loan amouat of US$40 million r-as
reduced to US$24 million in December 1986 (para. 5.6). The last lisbursement
on the loan was made on February 5, 1990 and an undisbursed amount of
US$2,294,900.65 was canceled.
Loan Allocation
5.6.      The original allocation which was revised three times and the final
allocation of the loan by categories is shown in Table 3B Part III. The first
revision was made in June 1985 to reallocate the amount originally allocated
for telephone switching to other components of the project. The second
revision to reduce the loan amount from US$40 million to US$24 million was
made in January 1987 and amounts allocated for telex and data were cancelled
on account of the severe economic situation in Uruguay, the curb on
investments and to take account of the savings in cables. The third
allocation reflects the estimated disbursements and adjustments needed under
each category of the loan during January 1989.
6. Prolect Regults
6.1.      flhjigfal Achievements.   Table 4 in Part III gives details of the
actual physicel achievements of the project as compared with the appraisal
estimates. Although delayed, the project achieved major additions and
replacements in the telephone network of Montevideo and other areas, as
follows:

Total           228.500            249.175
The rehabilitation of the cable network in 4ontevideo was completed for about
96,000 lines of the subscriber's network. The new satellite communication
station was established in March 1985. The new and combined national and
international automatic telephone exchange with a total of 4,162 terminations
was brought into service in February 1988.
6.2.      Apart from the physical achievements, assistance provided to ANTEL
by management consultants brought about improvement in its organization (para.
6.5). The tariff study also assisted ANTEL in its methodology of preparation
of proposals for periodic revision of tariffs.
Financial Performance
6.3.      Inflation averaged over 50X p.a. in Uruguay during 1981-89 and the
NUR$ was devalued at roughly the same rate against the US$. The annual
variations in inflation and devaluation rates were substantial (see financial
data attached to Part III). This, together with the four year delay in
project start up and completion caused distortions in ANTEL's financial
statements and makes a comparison with appraisal projections difficult.
However, based on ANTEL's financial statements expressed in US$, the operating
ratio was reduced from about 751 before the project to about 60% at project
completion and the return on revalued net fixed assets in operation increased



from about 10 to 25X, all of which is satisfactory and better than projected
at appraisal. Due to exchange losses, ANTEL's debt/equity ratio weakened from
about 23X to 40X, which is higher than appraisal projections but still
acceptable. This relatively good financial performance was made possible by
the connection of about 140,000 new subscribers in 1985 to 1990 and traffic
increases; the average revenue per subscriber increased from US$306 in 1985 to
$453 in 1990 mainly due to increased telephone traffic per subscriber; tariffs
iecreased slightly in real terms.
Economic Rate of Return
6.4.      Due to the close interrelation between the project and the rest of
ANTEL's investment program, a return on the 1981-85 program was estimated at
appraisal rather than a return on the project; the rate of return on this
program was deemed to be representative also for the project. A similar
approach has been taken for the re-evaluation of the economic rate of return,
but due to the delayed start-up and completion of the project, ANTEL's 1986-90
investment program has been used rather than the 1981-85 program. The re-
evaluated economic rate of return is 32% (see part III, Attachment 3), which
is slightly higher than the 24-301 return estimated at project appraisal.
Institutional Impact
6.5.      As a result of the study carried out by the management consultants
(Arthur D. Little, of USA) supplemented by ITU experts some institutional
improvements were achieved in ANTEL. A new organizational structure was
created which included (a) abolishing one entire layer of management; and (b)
consolidating all operations in five divisions. Three commissions reporting
to the General Manager directly were established for programming, operations,
and tariffs. However, ANTEL's Board's excessive interference in fairly minor
day to day operating matters remained an institutional problem. The staffing
plan which was developed by the consultants provided job descriptions and
qualifications for subsequent recruitment and reallocation, and strengthened
ANTEL's human resources in general and for key professional staff in
particular. ANTEL's accounting procedures and financial management also
improved. The overall productivity measure of staff improved from 23 at time
of appraisal to 14 per 1,000 telephones by 1990.
7.     Proiect Sustainability
7.1.      Considering the overall importance of telecommunication to economic
development and the growing demand for telecommunication services, basic as
well as new service investments for rehabilitation and expansion in this
sector in Uruguay are continuously needed. The Bank is actively considering
further support to this sector as a part of a Public Sector Reform Loan
involving private sector participation in ANTEL. The initial rehabilitation
and modernization achieved by automatization and digitalization in telephone
switching for dcmestic and international services have considerably improved
the quality of service and the institution building accomplished during this
project should be able to sustain the continuous development of the sector.

8.     Bank Performance
8.1.      Overall Bank performance was adequate.  The project was identified
and preappraised in June 1980 and appraised in October 1980 and presented to
the Bank's Board for approval in July 1981. Before Board approval, the bid
documents for the main component of the project had been prepared and bids
invited and speedy implementation was anticipated. However, as indicated in
para 5.2, the lack of commercial financing because of the financial crisis in
the region set back the major procurement. The Bank responded positively to
the changed situation and agreed to ANTEL's proposal to go for supplier
financing. The Bank assisted ANTEL in the preparation of the revised bids,
taking into account the price and financing terms in the evaluation which
ultimately resulted In the contract with the Brazilian subsidiary of L. H.
Ericsson Company. During supervision missions, the Bank assisted in
resolution of the technical issues in the introduction of the new digital
switching system. The Bank also gave timely guidance in procurement of other
components of the project. In spite of the overall severe macroeconomic
situation, the Bank was actively pressing for improvement in bill collection
from Government and its Agencies and for timely tariff adjustments in the
highly inflationary economy to maintain the financial viability of ANTEL. The
Bank was flexible and responded positively to ANTEL's proposals for
reallocation of the loan and reduction in the loan amount.
9.     Borrower Performance
9.1.      Although the initial preparation of the Project was well-planned,
implementation got delayed considerably for reasons beyond the control of
ANTEL (para. 5.2). ANTEL nevertheless came up with a solution to procure the
switching equipment and ultimately was able to make a satisfactory contract
with the Brazilian subsidiary of L.M. Ericsson. ANTEL was able to follow on
implementation of the project once the procurement of the switching equipment
had been finalized. There were some procedural delays in ANTEL as well in
other procurement, such as cables financed by the bilateral credit from Italy
in which there was a delay of one year in contract signature but most were
beyond its control. ANTEL's general performance is illustrated in the
Attachment on Performance Indicators. There was definite improvement in the
quality of service both with respect to fault repairs and call completion.
Overall ANTEL also performed well in the institutional area by reorganizing as
proposed by the consultants and improving its financial performance durieg a
very difficult economic period in Uruguay. Host project implementation delays
were caused by factors outside the control of the Bank and ANTEL.
10. Project RelationshiR
10.1.     Bank relationship with the Government and ANTEL in the project was
good.
11. Consulting Services
11.1.     The Bank loan did not finance any consulting services; as agreed
during appraisal, ANTEL retained consultants and some experts for organization
management and human resource development with its own funds (see para. 6.5).



- 8 -
The consulting services were satisfactory. The main achievements derived from
the consulting services are the improvement in the maintenance of the
telephone lines through the use of productivity incentives and the
reorganization of ANTEL which improved its performance.
12.       Project Documentation and Data
12.1.     The Appraisal Report and the Loan Documents were appropriate for
monitoring the implementation of the project. The periodical progress reports
sent by ANTEL were very detailed and appropriate for project supervision.

FIRST TELECOM2UNICATIONS PROJECT
(LOAN 2033-UR)
PART II      BORROWER' S PERSPECTIVE OF THE DESIGN. IMPLEMENTAIO
AND DEVELOPMENT IHPAGT OF THE PROJECT
13.1.     The Bank staff had excellent relations with ANTEL's staff at all
times, recognizing their capability to do the job.
13.2.     Notwithstanding the fact that Bank missions were composed correctly
in staff, the time this staff had to prepare their reports and to contact
both, personnel, and works involved in the Project was extremely short.
13.3.     In particular, a Project like this one, which included an expansion
and improvement of the external plant, with installation of approximately
210,000 digital lines, requires that the technicians in charge of solving
possible changes, in supply of materials or services, be fully aware that the
changes proposed are originated from real needs.
Eueriences learned in the development of the Prolec
13.4.     If we observe the project development generally, even though the
Loan was declared effective in January 1982, the first award was made in
December 1986, there was thus an important delay in the effective use of the
Loan.
13.5.     Among the causes for delay of the Project, we can mention:
(a) The Financial crisis of November 1982, which led to a total change
in the scope of financing of all our projects, and a serious
limitation on the public investment budget.
(b) Internal reorganization of ANTEL in the year 1984, implying a
revision of the Project.
(c) On March 1, 1985, the new democratic government assumed power,
leading to questioning of the newly appointed authorities of the
Montevideo Digitalization Project, awarded by ANTEL to the L. M.
Ericsson company, with negative consequences for the rapid
development of the works.
(d) At the end of 1985, two of the bid specifications, 04 and 05, were
observed by the possible suppliers to contain some specifications
contrary to national laws, although they were in agreement with the
loan agreement covenants. This delayed the procurement more than one
year, a period required for the legal procedures to address these
issues.
(e)  In 1986 a review -:f the Telecommunications Project was made; this
led to canceling the Telex and Data tender (bid no. 09), and a
request to the Bank to reallocate funds by categories.
(f) In 1986, several invitation for bids were made, but some of them
were delayed by legal objectives by suppliers, and others were



- 10 -
annulled by observations made either by ANTEL or by the Comptroller
General ("Tribunal de Cuentaso).
The points mentioned above show that, in order to obtain more efficiency in
Loan execution, the Bank should consider that a Loan Project contain, before
final approval:
(i) bidding specifications ready for the procurement of goods and
services.
(ii) awards conditioned to Loan effectiveness.
This report was sent by Cra. Rosario Nedero, President of ANTEL, in a letter
dated November 11, 1991.

(LOAN 2033-UR)
Financial Performance
Financial Data and Comments
1.        Due to high domestic inflation, appraisal projections were made in
current US$ and ANTEL has translated its actual pesos statements into US$
statements annually to permit comparisons. Inflation, peso devaluation and
ANTEL's tariff increases have roughly averaged 50X p.a. during the 1980s.
However, values for individual years have varied significantly as indicated by
the following table:
Annual Increases X             Accumulated Increases
Inflation   NUR/US$/    Tariffs   Inflation   NUR/US$   Tariffs
1980             -          -          -        1.00       1.00       1.00
1981            30         19         27        1.30       1.19       1.27
1982            21         28         20        1.57       1.52       1.52
1983            52        15'         71        2.39       3.82       2.61
1984            72         6.33       77        4.11       6.31       4.61
1985            83         81         97        7.53      11.42       9.09
1986            71         50         56        12.87     17.13      14.18
1987            57         49         52        20.20     25.55      21.55
1988            69         58         64        34.15     40.32      35.33
1989            89         68         67        64.54     67.73      59.01
ia  Based on the annual average exchange rate between the NUR$ and US$
used by ANTEL to translate its peso income statements into US$
statements.
2.        The high inflation and devaluation rates have distorted ANTEL's US$
statements, especially for years in which these rates have been significantly
different, e.g. fixed assets, which are revalued at a 50/50 mix of inflation
and increase in US$ rate, would have lower US$ values in years with higher
devaluation of the peso than inflation rate. The same goes for long-term
debt, depending on the mix between loans in domestic and foreign currency.
Further, ANTEL's US$ statements are year-end translations of its peso
statements, which show exchange losses. Such losses would not occur if US$
accounts had been maintained and were not projected for at appraisal. For
those reasons, comparison of specific values for certain years may not be

meaningful; trends in ANTEL's financial performance and ratios, however,
should be less distorted.
3.        A summary of ANTEL's US$ income statements and balance sheets for
1981-90 is presented below; no US$ funds flow statements were prepared by
ANTEL.

ECONOMIC RATE OF RETURN
1.  Assmption
(a) ANTEL's 1985-89 program investments as given in the table are
assumed to equal relevant expenditures. As capitalized interest
during construction may be included, these capital expenditures are
likely to be on the high side;
(b) a total of 75,000 DELs replaced; 25,000 in 1987, 1988 and 1989 each;
(c) no traffic increase would have been possible without the investment
program due to the severe pre-project congestion;
(d) all net additions of DELs in 1987 to 1990, about 110,000, are due to
the 1985-89 investment program; and
(e) the incremental operating costs exclude depreciation (estimated from
balance sheet data) and are low due to the replacement of old, high
operating cost DELs with now more efficient ones.
2.        On the above basis, the following cash-flows are estimated in US$
million:
Cap        Ops          Ops           Net
Year           Exp        Exp          Rev        Cash-Flow
1985             43.8        -             -           (43.8)
1986              54.4       -             -           (54.4)
1987              54.9       1.0          22.9         (33.0)
1988             40.7        2.0          45.8           3.1
1989              56.6       3.0          82.9          23.3
1990               -         4.0         109.8         105.8
1991-2008          -         5.0         125.0         120.0
3.        The above net cash flow results in an ERR of 36Z in nominal terms
and 32X in real terms (assuming an average dollar inflation of 3X p.a.).
