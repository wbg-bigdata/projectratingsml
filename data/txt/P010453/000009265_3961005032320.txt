MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF PAKISTAN
FOR A
BALOCHISTAN NATURAL RESOUPIrE MANAGEMENT PROJECT
1.           I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for SDR 10.7 million, the equivalent of US$14.7
million, on standard IDA terms with a maturity of 35 years to help finance a project for Balochistan
Natural Resource Management. The project focuses on environmer.tal protection and natural resource
management.
2.           Country/Sector Background. Balochistan's economy relies heavily on the productivity
of its natural resources. However, over the last 40 years rapid human and livestock population growth
and improper land use have caused its natural resource base to deteriorate rapidly. Desertificatiorn is
increasing. Excessive tree cutting in watersheds is denuding already sparse hillsides and causing erosion
and flash-flooding. Over-grazing and uprooting of small shrubs are further degrading already badly
impaifed natural rangeland pastures, dtcreasing water infiltration, and reducing wildlife habitat. Over-
pumping of upland aquifers is seriously lowering water tables. Sand dune movement on the coastline is
destroying roads, buildings, airports and port facilities. Hunting and the destruction of natural habitat
are seriously depleting Balochistan's wildlife.
3.           In Balochistan, as throughout Pakistan, natural resource mismapagement is closely tied
to poverty, to market, policy and institutional failure, to inadequate legislation and enforcement and to
a low level of public awareness. Increasing human and livestock populations are destroying natural
forests. In addition, such pressures and exposure to outside influences are breaking down traditional or
tribal rangeland management systems. Groundwater use policies are contributing to the over-pumping
of aquifers rather than to the efficient, sustained use of groundwater. The present provincial legislation
limiting the siting and number of tubewells drilled is ineffective and not based on sound technical data.
Sever:-i Govermnent of Balochistan (GOBal) agencies are subsidizing the cost of drilling by up to 40%
of the commnercial rate. Electricity charges for pumping are also subsidized, and only exacerbate the
problem. Under the proposed Power Sector Development Project, the Bank will address this as well as
several other price policy issues.
4.           Balochistan's environmental protection institutions are weak and inadequately financed.
BEPA, Balochistan's Environmental Protection Agency, which GOBal established early in 1992 is yet
to become fully operational. It needs overall strengthening to prepare and initiate work programs. The
Balochistan Forest Department (BFD), which is responsible for forests and rangelands, operates with
outdated management. It has adhered to a narrow view of its responsibilities, that is, traditional"top
down" forest management, and has shown even less interest in protecting rangelands.
5.           GOBal's natural resource management strategies are derived from  the National
Conservation Strategy (NCS) which was recently completed. To promote effective natural resource
management, NCS proposes achieving greater community partnership in development and natural
resource management, merging environmental and economic concerns in decision making, and focussing
on durable improvements in education, health and income. GOBal's natural resource management
strategies, which the Bank and other donors generally support, stress the importance of capital



-2-
accumulation and income growth to reduce poverty and encourage sustainable natu: al resource use.
Capital accumulation here encompasses all its forms, particularly human, institutional and cultural as well
as natural, physical and financial.
6.           Country Assistance Strategy. The World Bank Group's country assistance strategy for
Pakistan (last discussed with the Board July 2, 1992, and scheduled for next review later this financial
year) focuses on reducing constraints to sustained growth; and alleviating poverty. To support the growth
objective, Bank Group efforts have concentrated on: structural reforms, emphasizing public finance issues
and improving the enabling environment for the private sector; strengthening inadequate basic
infrastructure; reducing constraints on agriculture productivity; and protecting Pakistan's natural resources
base. Beyond growth, which will help on income-related aspects of poverty, the Bank's approach to
poverty focuses on imnproving inadequate basic social services to improve social indicators. rhis project
fits into the Bank Group's country assistance strategy as it would directly help to protect and develop
Balochistan's natural resources through strengthening Balochistan's environmental protection institutions,
involving the private sector in natural resource development and management, improving natural resource
use policies and rehabilitating damaged natural resources.
7.           Lessons from Past IDA Involvement. The proposed project incorporates successful
features, and lessons learned, from earlier natural resource management projects in Pakistan and
elsewhere in the world. The main features include: (a) developing or changing policies to reduce
distortions in natural resource values and costs caused by market and policy failure; (b) establishing
programs to improve data bases and knowledge concerning polluition and natural resource degradation,
including monitoring changes in pollution and resource degradation levels; (c) involving local
communities in project design and impiementation, plus strengthening their organizations and skills; (d)
strengthening government institutions so they have the capability to work with local communities, and
to properly administer the natural resources for which they are responsible; (e) adopting a multi-enterprise
approach to natural resource development; and (f) using adaptive research and pilot programs to solve
socio-technical problems concerning natural resource use.
8.           Rationale for Bank Involvement. This project forms an integral part of the Government
of Pakistan's (GOP) environmental protection and natural resource management strategies which IDA
supports. Through both the macro-economic dialogue at the central level and the more technically
oriented investments at the project level, IDA is well placed to assist GOP and the provincial governments
in tackling the range of policy, institutional and technical issues that relate to environment and natural
resource management. IDA can also make a major contribution to encouraging coordination between
donors on key policy and institutional issues. The project would also complement the Pakistan
Environmental Protection and Resource Conservation Project (Cr. 2383-PAK) (EPRC) which was
approved in June 1992. EPRC is aimed at strengthening environmental institutions, developing
legislation, policies and programs, training staff and addressing high priority natural resource problems
at the federal level, in the other three provinces and in Azad Jammu and Kashmir.
9.           Project Objectives.  The project's objectives are to: (a) strengthen the principal
institutions in Balochistan responsible for environmental protection and natural resource management; (b)
develop policies for improved and sustainable use of natural resources; (c) increase policy-makers,
government officials and the publics' awareness of damage being done to the enviromnent; and (d)
addrnss some immediate high priority resource management problems in the province.



-3-
1C.          Project Description.  Individual project components are.  (a) establishing an
Environmental Section (ES) within Balochistan's Planning and Development Department (P&D) by
providing staff, training, technical assistance, equipment, vehicles and operating funds; (b) strengthening
BEPA through providing staff, training, technical assistance, equipment, vehicles znd operating funds;
(c) strengthening BFD through providing training in community extension, project planning and national
park management; (d) studies and actions to improve policies concerning the use of natural resources,
particularly aquifers, rangeland and wooded areas, and feasibility studies to prepare other natural resource
use projects; (e) initiating mass awareness programs to educate decision makers and the public concerning
environmental issues through workshops, short programs on radio and television, articles in newspapers
and magazines, the use of billboards and posters, and other means; (f) two operational subprojects to
rehabilitate and develop damaged natural resources, that is: {i) sand dune stabilization at Gwadar, Pasni
and Pishukan on the Mekran coast; and (ii) development and management of the Hazarganji-Chiltan
national park near Quetta; and (g) two pilot program subprojects to develop site-specific methods of
rehabilitating and developing damaged niatural resources, that is: (i) rangeland and watershed rehabilitation
in Northem Balochistan (250 to 400 mm rainfall); and (ii) conservation of the juniper forest near Ziarat.
All subprojects were selected because they address pressing problems of natural resource degradation,
are acceptable to the local population, have internal rates of return of at least 10% (where calculable),
conform to GOBal and Bank strategies and priorities and are within GrOBal's capabilities to implement
with reasonable technical assistance support. The rangeland and watershed pilot subproject would test,
under farmer management, the introduction of a more productive fodder shrub (Atriplex canescens) to
rangeland gra7ing systems. The juniper forest conservation pilot subproject would test both a new system
of managing the juniper areas (rezoning plus local conmmunity input) and the feasibility of growing shrub
fuelwood plantations to substitute for the commnunities' presint rights to gather fuelwood from the juniper
areas. At the mid-term review, besides reviewing the two pilot programs' general direction, GOBal and
IDA will decide whether to expand the fuelwood plantations at Ziarat.
11.          The project has an estimated cost of US$17.8 million equivalent with a foreign exchange
component of US$5.4 million (30%). IDA's proposed credit of SDR 10.7 million (US$14.7 million
equivalent) would finance 83% of project costs, including 100% of foreign exchange costs and 75% of
local costs. The remaining project costs would be financed by the community farmers and households
(3 %) and GOBal (14%). Schedule A shows a breakdown of project costs and the financing plan, while
Schedule B shows amounts and methods of procurement and disbursements, and the disbursement
schedule. Schedules C and D respectively give a timetable of key processing events, and the status of
Bank Group operations in Pakistan. The attached map shows the location of the natural resource
subprojects which the project would implement, while the Staff Appraisal Report, No 12223-PAK, dated
March 1, 1994, is being circulated separately.
12.          Implementation. P&D (through ES), BEPA and BFD tog.ther would implement the
project, with BFD considerably involving local communities in implementing the operational and pilot
program  subprojects.  ES would be responsible for coordinating environmental matters within
Balochistan, and formulating environmental policy, legislation and regulations. It would review and
monitor natural resource management, and initiate the design and introduction of improved natural
resource use policies when necessary. BEPA is mainly a regulatory agency and would be responsible
for measuring and monitoring pollutant discharges, legally enforcing national/provincial environmental
quality standards, assisting in designing and implementing environmental impact assessment procedures
and implementing mass awareness programs. BFD would be responsible for implementing the natural
resource rehabilitation subprojects and pilot programs. GOBal would establish a project steering
comnmittee to coordinate the agencies' work, and ES would act as the committee's secretariat, preparing
its agenda and monitoring its decisions. BFD would ensure meaningful community participation in



-4-
project components through awareness programs, diagnostic studies, "round-table" conferences between
implementing agencies and communities, employing local sociologists to act as social organizers and
interface between agencies and communities, and agreement on action plans by communities and
implementing agencies before commencing program works.
13.          Both BEPA and BFD have most of their project staff already in place. While ES has
recruited and placed its key staff, it is a new group within P&D, and thus would take some time to
become fully functional. Two non-governmental organizations, the World Wide Fund for Nature and
the Balochistan Rural Services Group, will assist govermnent agencies implement the project.
14.          Sustainability. Overall, the project emphasizes the establishing and strengthening of ES,
BEPA, BFD and local organizations to sustain changes and actions which the project introduces. This
strengthening of agencies, however, will only result in the hiring of some 20 additional middle and higher
level staff. Consequently the recurrent expenditure obligations which GOBal will assume under the
project represent only marginal increases in existing budgets. As well, at the project's mid-term review
and in its final year IDA and GOBal would aszess the long-run appropriateness of the project's proposed
staffing and decide which positions should be made permanent at the project's conclusion. IDA will fund
the project's incremental recurrent expenditures on a strictly declining basis, and by project completion
GOBal will be meeting 50% of these costs.
15.          Actions Agreed. At negotiations IDA and GOBal agreed on the following: (a) by
September 30, 1994, P&D would recruit and place the balance of ES's staff, that is, one Director, one
Assistant Director, and four Research Assistants, plus the remaining required support staff; (b) by June
30, 1996, ES would complete the study to develop technical criteria for regulating access to Balochistan's
aquifers, and would have drafted appropriate legislation; (c) during July 1, 1994 to Jan-uary 1, 1997,
GOBal agencies would eliminate in three stages, all subsidies they provide when drilling tubewells, that
is, by no later than July 1, 1994, reduce the drilling subsidies to 70% of the level at which they stood
on July 1, 1993; by no later than July 1, 1995 to 409% of this level; by no later than July 1, 1996 to 10%
of this level: and by January 1, 1997 completely eliminate all drilling subsidies; (d) by December 31,
1994, ES, BEPA and BFD would finalize arrangements and sign contracts for engaging internationally
recruited consultants, with qualifications and under conditions acceptable to IDA, to assist in
implementing the project; (e) during the project's final implementation year, P&D, BEPA and IDA
together would review the staffing and effectiveness of ES and BEPA and agree which staff (higher-level
and support) should be made permanent after project completion, that is, funded from the province's non-
development budget; (f) BFD shall, before commencing any programs under the four subprojects, take
suitable steps to identify the community groups that would participate in such programs and agree with
them on the necessary action plans to catry out these programs; and (g) P&D, BEPA and BFD, in
accordance with terms of reference acceptable to IDA, and jointly with IDA and observers from
appropriate non-governmental organizations, would undertake a mid-term review of the overall project
and individual subprojects by no later than September 30, 1996, and would produce a report identifying
any required changes in project implementation with whicl the project agencies would comply. The
credit would not become effective until the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council has
approved the project's Planning Commission Forms No. 1 and sanctioned project expenditures.
16.          Enviromnental Aspects.  The project falls within the Bank-Group environmental
screening category B. The project is aimed specifically at improving the environment through the
introduction of sustainable natural resource management practices.



-5..
17.          Project Objectives. This is a resource management project. The project also focusses
on poverty alleviation as it aims to raise the incomes of subsistence farmers and fishermen.
18.          Benefits.  Primary project benefits are expected to include:  (a) building GOBal's
capabilities to deal with environmental protection and conservation of natural resources: (b) improving
the public's understanding and awareness of harmful effects of environmental and natural resource
degradation; (c) preserving a portion of Ziarat's juniper forest; (d) preventing damage to public buildings,
homes and infrastructure, including a fishing port, on the Mekran coast; (e) producing and implementing
a management plan for Hazarganji-Chiltan National Park, and creating educational and recreational
facilities for the public; and (f) improving range management with resulting increases in livestock
productivity and farmer incomes.
19.          Risks. Possible project risks include the following: (a) environmental institutions may
be delayed in recruiting suitablv qualified staff; (b) the harsh climatic conditions on the Mekran coast may
slow tree planting and adversely impact on the subproject's internal economic rate of return, while the
use of a single tree specie for sand dune fixation increases the risk of plantation failure due to disease;
(c) the tribespeople who recently camped near the eastern boundary of the Hazarganji-Chiltan National
Park may continue to illegally collect firewood and graze their animals in the park; (d) the cost of
establishing Atriplex canescens in rangelands may be too high fo; it to be economically attractive to
farmers; and (e) local communities near Ziarat may not accept the zoning of the juniper forest areas, and
the proposed community fuelwood plantations may be technically infeasible. While these adverse
possibilities could occur, the project has been designed to keep the probability of occurrence to an
acceptable level. These design features include: (a) considerable local and foreign training to upgrade
local staff's capabilities; (b) a project launch workshop which will emphasize early nursery establishment
and a research program to widen the tree specie base for sand dune stabilization; (c) while the
tribespeople's present camp site is temporary (these people, who recently returned from Afghanistan, are
currently settled at the site because of an inter-tribal dispute, but should eventually return to their tribal
lands) and the government has increased the statr regulating access to the park, the project would provide
a local sociologist who would interface between BFD and the tribespeople, and GOBal and IDA have
agreed that, if necessary, BFD will not implement the proposed park development plan until it provides
for a solution to the issue satisfactory to IDA; (d) atriplex planting operations would be varied to help
find a least cost approach, and project staff would closely monitor all aspects of this pilot operation so
they can determine its economic, social and technical feasibility; and (e) ensuring community agreement
to the proposed forest zoning by project staff actively and meaningfully involving them in the design and
implementation of the operation. Community fuelwood plantations will be located at the most favorable
sites regarding climate and soils, and will only be planted to fast growing woody shrubs.
20.           Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply wit:, the Articles
of Agreement of the Association, and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
