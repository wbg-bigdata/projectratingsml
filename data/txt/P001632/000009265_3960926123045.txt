MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE GOVERNMENT OF MALAWI FOR A
SNALLHOLDER AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
1.        The following report on a proposed development credit to the
Government of Malawi for SDR 4.6 million (US$5.9 million equivalent) is
submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms and
would assist in the financing of a project to improve the efficiency and
viability of the national credit system for smallholders in Malawi. The Project
will be cofinanced by IFAD to the extent of SDR 5.4 million (US$6.9 million
equivalent).
2.        Backround.  Malawi is heavily dependent on agriculture which supports
about 85% of the population of over 7 million people, and in 1986 accounted for
37% of total GDP and 91% of all exports. Major exports include tobacco, tea,
and sugar. Over the years, the country has managed to maintain self-sufficiency
in food production. Smallholders cultivating customary lands produce 80% of all
agricultural output. The estates cultivating freehold or leasehold lands
produce largely for export. In the 1970s, agricultural production growth rates
were impressive but they have been more modest in the 1980s due to worsening
terms of trade for Malawi's major exports, sharply higher transport costs, and
poor weather. Because of limited arable land, most future increases in
agricultural production will have to come from areas already cultivated throtngh
intensification and ,.reater productivity.
3.        The Government's agricultural policy is geared to: (a) maintaining
food self-sufficiency; (b) diversifying production; (c) expanding agricultural
exports; and (d) improving rural incomes. Since 1978, the National Rural
Development Program (NRDP) has been the main Government channel for developing
smallholder agriculture. NRDP is an area oriented program providing
smallholders with extension, adaptive research, marketing, inputs and credit
services. However, the production response from this program has been
disappo_-ting, due to shortcomings in technology, research/extension linkages,
credit allocations and marketing. In recent years there has been a shift in
Government's strategy with full support from the Bank and other donors to
improve basic services nationally, including agricultur^l research, extension,
marketing, and credit systems which operate in conjunction with the NRDP.  The
Bank is supporting the new Government strategy through the nationally-oriented
Agricultural Research and Agricultur-l Extension and Planning Projects (Cr.
1549--MAI and 1626-MAI). The proposed credit Project will provide a national
focus to credit operations. The Bank is also assisting the Government to
improve the agricultural policy environment facing smallholders through a series
of structural adjustment operations under which there has been significant
pricing and marketing reforms including privatization, a gradual reduction in
fertilizer subsidies, inreased budgetary allocation to the Ministry of
Agriculture (MOA) and streamlining of the state-owned Agricultural Development
and Marketing Cooperation.
4.        With the help of donors, Malawi has established a relatively
successful smallholder agricultural credit operation. However, there is scope
for making it more efficient. Managed by MOA, the scheme, which supplies mostly
seasonal credit, is characterized by group lending and high recovery rates. The
interest rates for seasonal credit were until recently 13.3% p.a., and for
medium-term credit 10% p.a.; these were slightly below commercial rates
(inflation in Malawi is estimated at 15% p.a.). Some deficiencies which need to



- 2 -
be addressed, include: (a) the absence of a national framework for planning,
coordinating, and monitoring credit operations, which has led to inefficiencies
in the use of the financial resources; (b) resource constraints arising from
restrictionu concerning where credit funds provided by various donors can be
used; (c) unsatisfactory uptake and recovery of medium-term credit mainly due to
administrative shortcomings; (d) lack of cost accounting for administrative
expenditures; (e) low interest rates resulting in unsustainable credit programs;
and (f) insufficient means of tapping savings in rural areas. These constraints
would be addressed under the proposed Project.
5.        Project Objectives.  The Project aims to establish an efficient and
financially viable national credit delivery system that would benefit a
significantly greater number of smallholders than at present by: (a)
consolidating area-based programs into a strengthened national credit system;
(b) increasing flexibility in allocating credit resources; (c) meeting the
demand fzr credit; (d) initiating measures to mobilize rural savings; and (e)
exploring the possibility of providing group credit for non-land based economic
activities for the rural poor.
6.        Project Description.  The Project would be implemeated over a
seven-year period and would include funds for financing seasonal and medit'm-term
credit. It would also provide for additional staff, training, technical
assistance, vehicles, equipment, and other facilities to transform the existing
credit unit of the Ministry of Agriculture into a Smallholder Agricultural
Credit Administrat!on, with departmental status. The new Credit Administration
would be responsible for managing -- at a national level -- the smallholder
agricultural credit system and funds made available through various projects to
individual Area Development Divisions (ADDs) of the NRDP. These funds would be
consolidated into a Central Smallholder Credit Fund (SCF), an interest-bearing
account. Moreover, the Project would include a pilot credit scheme for the
rural poor, modelled on the IFAD-funded Grameen Bank in Bangladesh.  The total
cost of the Project is estimated at US$14.4 million with a foreign exchange
component of US$10.4 million (72%). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan
are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursement
are shown in Schedule B. The status of the Bank's operations and IFC's
investments in Malawi and the timetable for key project processing events are
given in Schedules C, D, and E, respectively. Map Nos. IBRD 20152 and IBRD
20608, and the Staff Appraisal Report No. 6886-MAI, dated October 9, 1987, are
also attached.
7.        Rationale for IDA Involvement.  IDA's development strategy in Malawi
has evolved in support of the Government's efforts to stimulate increased
productivity, develop a more diversified agricultural base, promote crop
exports, and improve rural incomes. IDA, through its lending operations and
sector work, is supporting the Government's strategy of strengthening key
national agricultural institutions, thereby improving the capacity for planning,
policy analysis, program implementation, and provision of basic services
efficiently. The proposed Project is consistent with this strategy and serves
to complement several on-going projects supported by IDA. The proposed Prcject
would help to consolidate agricultural credit activities now scattered among
several projects and to establish the required institutional capability. IDA's
involvement would also help facilitate policy changes including measures to
ensure positive interest rates in real terms.



8.        Actions Agreed Upon.  Interest rates chargeable to smallholdera have
been raised from 13.3% to 16.5% p.a. for seasonal credit and from 10% to 15%
p-a. for medium-term credit and the Government has agreed to ensure that
interest rates for smallholder credit are positive in real terms. The
Smallholder Agricultural Credit Administration (SACA), responsible for managing
the credit funds, has been established, and its senior staff ha.'e been
appointed. A central Smallholder Credit Fund (S-F), an interest-bearing
account, has also been created. SACA will pay interest of 2% per year on
resources transferred by the Government to the SCF,  -mpared to no interest
currently. The Government has also agreed: (a) to omplete a study on the
uptake of medium-term credit by June 30, 1988; (b) to review, by June 38, 1988,
the recurrent administrative expenditures related to the credit system; and (c)
to phase out budgetary support for credit administration by September 30, 1989.
To initiate the pilot rural credit and savings scheme for the rural poor, a
separate entity, satisfactory to IDA, would be established.
9.        Ju3tification.  A broad spectrum of farm families throughout the
country would benefit from the use of improved farm technologies made available
through the use of credit and extension. By utilizing improved technologies,
smallholders can achieve yield increases ranging from about 10% for groundnuts
to 40% for maize, thereby raising rural incomes and providing employment
opportunities. Moreovet, the Project would create a viable and susts.inable
institutional framework to better serve the smallholder subsector and establish
a specialized credit system for the poorest sector of the population.
Furthermore, the Project would lessen the recurrent budget allocations by the
Guvernment by about US$0.6 million annually. At full development, it is
expected that the number of borrowers benefitting from the credit would increase
from the present 200,000 to 400,000 families.
10.       Risks.  Possible risks include: (a) delayed implementation; (b)
inadequate producer prices; (c) unstable marketing arrangements; and (d)
insufficient capacity of the research and extension services to develop and
disseminate suitable technologies. Tnese risks would be minimized through
technical assistance to strengthen project implementation capability; on-going
project assistance to strengthen national research and extension services; and
the existing policy agreements and dialogue between the Government and IDA in
connection with the adjustment program on pricing, subsidies, and marketing.
11.       Recommendation.  l am satisfied that the prcoosed credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of Lhe Association and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
