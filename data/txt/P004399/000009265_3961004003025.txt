MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
THE INDEPENDENT STATE OF PAPUA NEW GUINEA
FOR A POPULATION AND FAMILY PLANNING PROJECT
1.        I submit for your approval the following memorandum and
reco-wendation on a proposed loan to the Independent State of Papua New Guinea
for US$6.9 million equivalent to help finance a population and family planning
project. The loan would be at the Bank's standard variable interest rate,
with a maturity of 20 years, including five years of grace. The project will
be cofinanced on a parallel basis by the Asian Development Bank (US$6.8
million) and the Australian International Development Assistance Burcau
(AIDAB) (US$10.0 million).
2.        Background.  The preliminary results of the 1990 census suggested an
annual population growth rate of 2.27 percent which is the figure used in
official releases although a post-enumeration check places the annual growth
rate in the 1980-1990 period as 2.5 percent. Further analysis indicates that
the annual growth rate is about 3.0 percent. With this growth rate, the
population may be expected to increase from nearly 4 million currently to
about 7.3 million by 2010. The rapid growth is sustained through a declining
mortality rate and a high fertility rate of about 5.3 (1980 data). There are
no reliable data available to assess trends, but fertility has probably
increased over the past decade. Current levels of infant and maternal
mortality remain high by international standards - infant mortality is
estimated to be about 60 per 1,000 live births and maternal mortality between
7-20 per 1,000 live births. The use of effective contraception is low,
probably under 10 percent of eligible couples.
3.        Concern over population issues cuts across political and sectoral
boundaries. An immediate benefit of slower population growth is that it would
allow a shift in the focus of education and health services investment from
keeping up with increased numbers to improvements in the quality and equity of
access to those services. Within the community of planners and economic
decision makers, there is growing apprehension over the pressure exerted by
the rapid increase in the number of young people on the ability to meet social
and economic aspirations. In the health sector, the contribution which
effective family planning services could make toward a reduction in maternal
and child mortality is recognized, but support for such services has been
limited in the absence of a clear policy and declining per capita resources
for the health sector.
4.        The position of women in PNG society is one of severe handicap and
underprivilege. Men hold a dominant position over decisions regarding women
and family matters including women's access to services. The rapid transition
from traditional single-sex living patterns to monogamy and nuclear family
housing creates considerable stress on the traditional rules regulating sexual
intercourse and procreation. High levels of sexually transmitted diseases,
associated with infertility, put further stresses on family life and female
health. Levels of serious violence directed at women are unusually high.
Such conditions point towards the need to dedicate major efforts toward



legitimization of family planning through the involvement of community
leaders, traditional and modern.
5.        The adoption of a national population policy by the National
Executive Council (NEC) in March 1991 was a major development and represented
the outcome of a NEC directive, dated January 1987, for the Department of
Finance and Planning (DFP) to establish a Population Policy Co-ordination Unit
and draft a population policy. The policy was launched at a national seminar
in 1991 and was widely discussed in the media and at diverse fora throughout
the country. The government has established a high level National Population
Council (NPC) for which the Population Planning Unit (PPU) acts as a
secretariat.  Thus, "population", in terms of the population-development nexus
as well as family planning as a female health issue, entered the national
development agenda. Non-government Organizations (NGOs), including the
churches, support the population policy out of considerations for family
welfAre, monogamy and female health.
6.        The population policy reflects the government's priority for human
resource development (HRD) in PNG. Recent population growth rates are
recognized as constraints on achieving the ERD goals as the institutional and
economic capacity to expand social services and employment has lagged behind
the growth in population. The government is well aware that cultural and
social conditions conspire against early prospects for lower fertility levels.
Given the momentum for further population growth inherent in the age
structure, even when replacement level fertility has been achieved, the
government's initiative to undertake a national population program testifies
to prudence and a long term perspective on development.
7.        Lessons from Previous Bank ExMerience.  The 1991 review by OED of
Bank experience with population programs suggested that certain conditions
should be fulfilled if a program is going to succeed, including broad
political support for a national policy on population, a senior body with
responsibility for overseeing and guiding the program, separation of policy
and operational functions, effective program organization, use of all
community networks, trained staff and coordination of donor assistance. The
Bank has sought to ensure that these pre-conditions are met and, in addition,
has successfully mobilized other donors with previous experience in the
sector. To date, the Bank has not financed any project for health or
population in PNG and the proposed project would be the first such operation.
8.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank sector report "Management,
Manpower and Money: A Select Review of Health and Population in PNG"
completed in 1990, assisted the Government in the formulation of its national
population policy which reflected most of the report's recommsndations. The
Bank was then requested to assist the Government in designing an
implementation strategy and action program, and to take the lead in
coordinating support from other donors. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) and
Australian International Development Assistance Bureau (AIDAB) joined with the
Bank to prepare and finance the project. Thus, the Bank is a8sisting the
Government to make its population initiative successful and to mobilize
additional external resources for this purpose. The project is breaking new
ground in a multi-cultural country which is undergoing complex social changes.
The Bank has accumulated considerable experience with implementing population



programs in such circumstances and this experience vill be made available to
PEG through this project.
9.        Proiect Obiectives.  The project will support the goverrnent's
population policy announced on March 1, 1991. The principal goals of the
project are to create the capacity to bring the rate of population growth into
balance with the country's potential for socio-economic development and, in
particular, human resources development, and to improve the health of mothers
and children through greater use of family planning. The more specific
objectives are to: (i) develop the institutional capacity to foster and
manage a comprehensive population program; (ii) deliver effective family
planning services; (iii) generare a greater demand for family planning; and
(iv) mobilize public awareness and support for the program through government
and non-government channels.  The project's strategy is to initially
concentrate on the most densely populated regions; five provinces, including
the main cities, will be included from the start plus the National Capital
District. Later during the project, the program will be extended to cover
other areas based on decisions to 'he made by the NPC. NGOs and the churches
will help to ensure the program's reach and continuity.
10.       Proiect Description.  The project has two elements.  The first is
support for family planning service delivery (baseline cost, US$12.2 million)
includIng: (a) upgrading of selected health facilities to provide effective
family planning services; (b) operational support for fixed facility and
outreach services including supervision and monitoring; (c) training in
clinical and communication skills both in-country and externally; and
(d) incremental staffing to enhance program management and supervision
capacity. The second group of activities will build long-term capacity for
the population program and will include (a) supply and distribution of
contraceptives and related drugs (US$6.1 million); (b) training, technical
assistance and financial support for UGOs (USz.1.1 million); (c) development of
a health and family planning promotion unit (US$2.8 million); (d) a sample
national demographic survey and piloting of a provincial data system (US$1.5
million); (e) operational and behavioral research snd research training
(US$0.9 million); and (f) program management (US$2.9 million). The proposed
loan of US$6.9 million would finance about 21 percent of total project costs,
net of duties and taxes. ADB would cofinance US$6.8 million (about 21 percent
of total project costs) on a parallel basis using Asian Development Fund
resources and AIDAB would cofinance US$10.0 million (about 31 percent of total
project costs) on a parallel basis using grant funds. Together, the three
agencies would provide US$23.7 million in external financing representing
about 73 percent of total estimated project costs, net of taxes. A breakdown
of costs is shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of
disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A
timetable of key processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in
Papua New Guinea are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is also
attached. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 11264-PNG dated March 12, 1993, is
being distributed separately.
11.       Proiect Implementation.  The project will be implemented over a five
year period through existing government structures, mainly the Population
Planning Unit (PPU) at DFP and the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) at
National Department of Health (NDOH), whose capacities will be enhanced
through increased staff and technical assistance to cope with the expected



additional work burden. A Project Steering Committee will hold the central
management responsibility for coordinating and guiding the project, reaching
decisions and resolving issues which may arise. As a recent structure, the
PPU bas had no experience in implementing projects. In contrast, the PIU
located within the Policy, Planning and Evaluation Unit of the Administration
Division of NDOH has had approximately 10 years experience in coordinating
health projects funded by the ADB. This experience will be built upon and the
PIU developed to perform coordinating functions for all externally funded
projects. An annual project review will be geared to the government's budget
cycle to allow, inter alia, flexibility in identifying activities for
financing after the initial year of project.
12.       Proiect Sustainability.  This is a new program which will generate
modest incremental costs through the need to create key management and some
technical posts at national and provincial levels to ensure effective
implementation. In addition, costs of contraceptives and drugs will increase
in line with project expansion as well as operations and maintenance costs for
dedicated health facilities and vehicles. While direct program coets will
increase cver time, these costs are likely to prove insignificant compared
with potential savings in health, education and child-rearing costs as birth
rates decline. To be effective, support for population activities will need
to extend over several decades.
13.      _Areed Actions.  Assurances were obtained at loan negotiations that
the Government would, prior to loan effectivenesss (a) recruit the long term
advisers; (b) recruit and post key staff positions for project management and
supervision; (c) meet all conditions precedent to the ADB loan agreement and
the Memorandum of Understanding of AIDAB; and (d) approve a separate budget
line item for Maternal and Child Health/Family Planning activities in the
project area.
14.       Benefits.  The project will assist the Government to develop
systematic and effective family planning services and referral for a broader
range of female health services which will contribute to female and child
health.  In the medium term, greater use of family planning will result in
lower fertility and lead to a moderation of population growth. Better access
to family planning may be expected to contribute towards an amelioration of
social tensions arising, in part, from a breakdown of traditional family
patterns and values. Eventually, lower birth rates will lead to enhanced
prospects for human resource development and improved and more sustainable
social and economic development. Availability of reliable demographic
information will strengthen government's ability to monitor social development
and to improve the basis for making informed decisions about future
development strategies. In the longer term, environmental management may
expect to benefit from a moderated rate of population growth.
15.       Risks.  There is broad support within the community for a population
program. However, expectations of any rapid decrease in fertility have to be
tempered by experience from other countries and particularly by recognition of
the low educational attainment and restricted access to information
characteristic of PNG. A long term and sustained effort will be required
which may test political resolve and which emphasizes the need to deeply
involve community based organizations. In the short term, because management
capabilities within the responsible agencies remain weak, institutional issues



- 5 -
are a concern. The risk will be reduced through the establishment of a high-
level Project Steering Committee and a health promotion center in NDOI and
provision of technical assistance for project management.
16.       Aecommendatiol_.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recofmend that the Executive
Directors approve it.
