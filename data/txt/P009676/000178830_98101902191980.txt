INTTMATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMENDATION OF THE PRESIDINT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE GOVERNMT OF INDIA
FOR AN EDUCATION PROJECT
1. *I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
credit to India in an amount equivalent to US$12 million on standard IDA
terms to help finance an Education Project in India for Agricultural
Universities.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The most recent economic report, "Economic Situation and
Prospects of India" (SA-32a, dated May 10, 1972) was distributed to the
Executive Directors on June 2, 1972. This report indicated that the
growth of the economy during the Indian fiscal year which ended on
Parch 31, 1972, was about three to four percent conpared with an average
of five percent during the preceding two years. Hopes for greater momen-
tum in economic growth did not materialize, mainly because of the
disappointing performance of the industrial sector, which continued to
suffer from management inadequacies, lack of demand for capital goods,
shortages of raw materials and labor unrest.
3.        The current rates of investment and savings are a cause for
concern.  Investment as a proportion of national income has declined
slightly since the beginning of the Fourth Five-Year Plan period
(1969/70-1973/74), and savings, though up in the same period, are a
long way from the goal set by the Plan. A lag in public savings has
been a major cause for this shortfall. For the renaining two years
of the Plan, the Planning Commission has projected an increase in invest-
ment and savings rates to meet at least the original financial targets
of the Plan. This should be feasible but given the increases in the price
level over the Plan period would imply a shortfal1 in Plan expenditures in
real terms in the order of 12 percent.
4.        Among the major sectors, agriculture has done remarkably well.
The satisfactory growth of agricultural production must be attributed
mainly to large increases in foodgrain production, which has met or
exceeded the Plan target of 5.6 percent annual growth. The growth of
foodgrain output is firmly based, especially as the new technology is
spreading from the cultivation of wheat to that of rice. The expansion
of production during the last three years has been favored by good
monsoon rains. Poor rainfall could easily cause setbacks. This year's
monsoon rain came late and in inadequate quantities, which led to crop
failures in Bihar and Rajasthan and may affect the important kharif crop.
The rest of the agricultural sector has done less well, particularly the
principal fiber crops of jute and cotton. Success in adopting the new
technology has not been distributed evenly throughout India. States such



-2-
as Punjab, Haryana, Mysore and Tamil Nadu have led the way; Assam and
Bihar remain relatively backward. Bihar has long been a deficit State
in food production, and Assam, while producing a surplus, registered
the smallest increase in yields per hectare of any State in India over
the past decade. Both States, therefore, attach high priority to
increasing agricultural production, particularly foodgrains, by the use
of modern farming methods. Along with such other components of moderm
farming as an assured supply of water, credit, fertilizer, marketing
facilities, high yielding variety seeds, comprehension of the new
-technology and the ability to apply it through education, research and
extension work are essential ingredients of the geographical spread of
the "green revolution".
5.        India's reserve position at the end of August was the equivalent
of 38 percent of annual imports plus debt service payments, but reserves
have fallen by more than US$100 million since the beginning of the Indian
fiscal year for a variety of reasons including the Government'   efforts
to overccme industrial raw material shortages by imports. The rate of
growth of exports has been slow, and uncertainty surrounds future levels
of net aid. In view of India's generally satisfactory economic perfor-
mance in recent years, the size of her population and the extent of her
poverty, India should continue to receive substantial assistance from IDA.
6.        A country data sheet is attached as Annex 2.
PART II - BANK GRCUP CPERATIONS IN INDIA
7.        Since 1949 the Bank has made 40 loans and 44 development credits
to India totalling respectively US$1 ,110 million and US$2,021 million
(both net of cancellations).  Of these amounts US$ 545  million has been
repaid and US$799   million is still undisbursed. Annex 1 contains a
summary statement of disbursements as of September 30, 1972 and a des-
cription of the status of currently active loans and credits.
8.        Since 1957 IFC has made 13 commitments in India totalling
US$42.3 million of which US$ 4 .3 million has been repaid, US$ 7.0  million
sold and US$ 6.3 million cancelled. Of the balance of US$224.7 million,
US$16.6 idl ion represents loans and US$8.1 million equity. A summary
statement of IFC operations as of September 30, 1972 is also included
in Annex 1 (page 2).
9.        In line with the importance of agriculture, which contributes
close to 50 percent of India's GNP, and the corresponding investment
priorities of the Government, emphasis of Bank Group assistance has
shifted increasingly to agriculture and agriculture-related projects in
recent years. This trend is expected to continue in the current fiscal
year. A number of projects in the areas of agricultural credit, agricul-
tural markets and agro-industry development are under advanced preparation
or appraisal. The project presented in this report is also designed to
foster agricultural development; so is a fertilizer project which I



expect to submit to you before the end of this calendar year. In our
lending we will endeavor to bring assistance to the more backward regions;
thus, the agricultural universities project discussed here would benefit
two major agricultural States whose output growth has fallen samewhat
behind the national average. An increasing proportion of Bank Group
assistance would be directed to the smaller and less affluent farmers
through lending for agricultural credit schemes and through support of
special Government programs such as for instance that for the drought-
prone areas.
10.       Assistance in the industrial field in the current fiscal year
would be concentrated on the support of development finance institutions.
A credit for the Industrial Development Bank of India for refinancing of
lending operations by State finance institutions should be ready for
your consideration within the next two months and would serve predominantly
small enterprises. A further loan to ICICI later this fiscal year is
under consideration. India's large cities, particularly Bombay and Calcutta.
would require vast investment in public utilities to keep up with the rapid
growth of their population. Bank Group assistance in this field is of
high priority and is expected to represent a sizeable proportion of our
total program in future years. A water supply project in Bombay and an
urban development project in Calcutta are included in this year's program.
11.       The urgent need for a substantial net transfer of external
resources in support of India's economy has been a recurrent theme of
Bank economic reports and of the discussions within the India Consortium.
We recognize that emphasis on lending for such critical sectors as agri-
culture or urban development is inevitab2ly leading to a relatively slow
transfer of IDA's resources. In order to balance our program we have in
the past included lending for more rapidly disbursing projects, such as
power transmission, teleconminications and industrial imports. We plan
to continue to provide assistance for such projects in the current fiscal
year. Because of the capacity of the capital goods sector of the Indian
economy, India imports relatively few capital goods. As in the case of
the credit now proposed, the Association should, therefore, be prepared
to help finance the local costs of high priority projects in support of
India's efforts to secure a transfer of resources adequate to sustain a
satisfactory rate of growth.
PART III   -   THE PROJECT
12.       This credit, if approved, would be the Bank Group's first
lending operation in India for education. The project was identified by
an FAO mission which visited India in November/December 1970.. A joint
FAO/Bank mission in July/August 1971 assisted the Government in its pre-
paration. The project was appraised in November/December 1971. Nego-
tiations took place in W2shington in September 1972. The Borrower was



-4-
represented by Dr. 0. P. Gautam, Deputy Director General, the Indian
Cduncil for Agricultural Research (ICAR), a division of the Ministry of
Agriculture; Mr. Abu Hakim, Director, Department of Agriculture, GOI;
Mr. G. Venkataraman, Deputy Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs,
GOI; Dr. Chakravarty, Vice Chancellor, Rajendra Agricultural University,
Bihar; Dr. Negi, Vice Chancellor, Assan Agricultural University; Mr. B.
S. Sarao, Agricultural Production Commissioner, Assam; and Mr. Dulai
Chandra Barau, Governnent of Assam.
13.       In education, the Indian record is one of considerable achieve-
ment, but the current structure of the education system raises questions
for the future. Between 1950-51 and 1968-69 enrollment in schools
trebled. While there was only limited expansion at the primary level,
university enrollment increased more than five fold. This expansion,
partlcularly in higher education, has been accompanied by unemployment
among graduates, including those of agricultural universities, in part
because they are poorly qua1ified, and has led to difficulties in
maintaining academic standards.
14.       In many states, the impact on agricultural prcduction of
agriculturally-oriented education, research and extension workc has, until
recently, been less effective than it could have been, largely because
responsibility for these important inputs has been diffuse and uncoordi-
nated. Most educational institutions at the secondary and university
level have been administered by State Governments under their Departments
of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry as relatively independent units; and
Central Government and numerous State organizations responsible for
research and extension have worked in isolation of each other and without
necessarily involving the educational institutions in their programs. It
was to remedy this situation that the Government of India designated ICAR
in 1966 as the body responsible for coordinating and strengthening such
programs throughout the country, primarily through the agency of the
agricultural universities which were being developed on the basis of the
American land-grant model, a pattern which has been successfully adapted
to Indian conditions. These universities were to become the nuclei for
advancing and disseminating agricultural technology in the States, and to
this end substantial financial support was, and is being, provided from
the Center to encaurage the States to integrate their various institutions
within the new universities (of which some 16 have been or are being
developed in 15 States).   In a number of States where the universities
have been firmly founded, this approach has already proved successful.
15.       The proposed project is designed to assist in the development
of the new agricultural universities in Assam and Bihar, which are being
formed by merging existing agricultural and veterinary colleges into
cohesive and more effective institutions in order to produce better trained
graduates to contribute to agricultural development in these States- With
increased responsibilities for research and extension, the two universi-
ties will provide more institutional support for the technological demands
of the "green revolution" and thus reinforce the efforts which GOI is



making to stimulate rural development. The project would also provide a
new computer and ancillary equipment for the Institute of Agricultural
Research Statistics (IARS) at Pusa, Delhi. The present computer
capacity of IARS is severely overloaded on a two shift basis; the anti-
cipated volume and complexity of work require a new and larger facility,
which would serve the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IALI3),
several agricultural universities, the 28 research institutes of ICAR
and IARS itself. Each of the two universities is to have two campuses,
one for general agriculture and the other for veterinary science.
Constniction under the project wouldinclude academic facilities such as
laboratories, class rooms and lecture halls, dornitories, staff and
faculty housing; it is expected to be completed by 1978.   Each univer-
sity would be responsible for agricultural research and extension
educaticn within the State and for extension services within a limited
area near the University. Responsibility for extension work is expected
to expand and eventually encompass the entire State as each university
develops. Total project costs are estimated at US$19.4 million.
Construction cost estimates are based on recent costs of similar projects
in India. The average cost per square metre for the universitie5 is
estimated at US$65 ; it compares well with estimated figures of US$70
in Iran (1970) and US$65 in Thailand (1970). The credit of US$12 million
would finance the foreign exchange costs of US$5.2 million plus about
half the local costs. A project summary is attached as Annex 3.
16.       The Education Division of ICAR would provide overall guidance
and supervision for the execution of the project. ICAR is qualified
and experienced in this regard, having been instrumental in establishing
similar universities elsewhere in India. The Deputy Director General
for Education of ICAR would be the Central Project Director; he would
be assisted by a full-time Project Coordinator. A project unit would
be established at the main campus of each university to coordinate
project implementation at each site* It would be headed by the Vice
Chancellor assisted by a Project Architect and a Procurement Officer.
17.       Contracts for civil works at the four campuses at Gaubati.,
Jorhat, Dholi-Pusa and Ranchi would be grouped whenever their nature and
timing mako it practicable to do so. Although most contracts are then
expected to total more than US$100,000, they would nevertheless be
relatively small and unlikely to attract the interest of foreign
contractors. They would not warrant the effort and expeai of interna-
tional advertising and tendering and would be let, therefore, on the
basis of competitive bidding following advertisement in local and
national publications. Instructional and computer equipment e:pected
to cost more than US$100,000 would be procured through international
competitive bidding in accordance with IDA guidelines for procuremn1t
Items would be grouped to form sizeable bid packages for bulk purchasing.
Local manufacturers would be allowed a preferential margin of 15 percent
of the c.i.f. price or the existing rate of customs duty, whichever is
lower. Equipment estimated to cost less than US$100,000 and all furniture,
which is of unsophisticated design and of ample supply locally, would be



-6-
procured locally. The project unit would be responsible for preparing
and issuing tenders, evaluating bids and awarding contracts. Detailed
master lists of furniture and equipment would be submitted for IDA review.
18.       The proposed credit would finance a substantial amount for
technical assistance to support the leadership of each university. This
assistance would include: (a) for each Vice Chancellor, an advisor highly
qualified in organization and administration, preferably a former Vice
Chancellor or Dean of Agriculture with land-grant college experience;
(b) advisers and specialists in Home Science; (c) advisers and specialists
in Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Sciences; and (d) an architect for
each project unit to assist the Vice Chancellor in carrying out the
project. In selecting these experts, India may draw upon the staffs of
the successful, well-established agricultural universities, such as those
in Punjab and Uttar Pradesh, but foreign excperts may be required if
qualified personnel are not available in India. A substantial Fellowship
Program is also included in the project, 78 man-years for Assam and 40
for Bihar, in order to improve the qualifications of faculty and staff.
19.       Because there is at present a surplus of agricultural graduates
in India as a whole, the emphasis of the project is directed, not towards
an increase in the output of qualified students (both universities have
been formed by amalgamating existing colleges), but towards an improve-
ment in the quality of the education received by students and in its
relevance to agricultural development under local conditions. Although
the better qualified agricultural graduates, especially from the established
universities in the Punjab and Uttar Pradesh, readily find employment,
there is some unemployment among agricultural graduates in Bihar. Assam,
however, faces a current shortage of technicians trained in agriculture.
Even in Bihar, however, there should be many opportunities for employment
in view of the action being taken to improve and increase agricultural
services. In both States, the demand for agricultural graduates within
the private and cooperative banking sectors is increasing as these organi-
zations step up their lending operations directed to farmers. We are
convinced that the projected number of graduates from the two universities
should find ready employment opportunities.
20.       The research and extension work of both universities is of
great importance.  In other States, notably the Punjab and Uttar Pradesh,
agricultural universities have been important instruments of agricultural
development, particularly because they unite the inter-related functions
of education, research and extension. It would be an important function
of the proposed universities to develop research and extension education
in Bihar and Assam. The project makes provision for assistance in the
development of these services.
21.       Assistance by the State Governments in support of these univer-
sities will be important. The States would have to provide funds to
meet recurring costs at a level sufficient to sustain the universities'
programs.   The burden of these expenditures should not prove onerous,
since even when these costs increase under the project they would still
represent less than 5 percent of State plan allocations for all



- 7 -
agriculture and allied activities in both cases. The significant
advantage of the land-grant type of university is the mutually reinfor-
cing relationship between education, research and extension which it
fosters. The benefits can only be realized if the universities work
closely with other public and private institutions serving the farmers
in the area. Undertakings to assure both provision of the necessary funds
and for close cooperation between the universities and other agricultural
institutions form part of the draft agreements with the State Governients
of Bihar and Assam. In particular, certain research institutions in
Assam would be transferred to the university.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
22.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between India and the
International Development Association, the draft Project Agreement between
Assam Agricultural University, and      Rajendra Agricultural University
of Bihar and the Association, the draft Assam and Bihar Agreement between
the States of Assam and Bihar and the Association, the Recommendation of
the Committee provided for in Article V, Section 1(d) of the Articles of
Agreement and the text of the Resolution approving the proposed Develop-
ment Credit are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
23.       The draft Development Credit Agreement, Section 7.01, includes
as conditions of effectiveness: (a) the appointment of advisers to the
Vice Chancellors, (b) the designation of the Deputy Director General for
Education of ICAR as Director of the Central Project Unit, and (c) the
appointment of a full-time Project Coordinator for the Central Project
Unit.
24.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit will comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART V - RECOMMENDATION
25.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.

C.  COMMENTS ON CURRENTLY ACTIVE PROJECTS
1. *    Loan 307-IN - Indian Iron and Steel Company.   This loan was
made in 1961; the implenentation of the project has been affected by
technical and managerial difficulties connected with the opening of
new collieries to supply IISCO's steel plant. The Bank together with
technical consultants have been providing constant supervision and
progress is now being made in resolving the technical issues. On the
managerial side, the Government of India announced on July 20, 1972
that it was taking over the management of IISCO for two years. The
Government has assured us that this action will not interfere with
IISCO s obligations to the Bank. On September 30, 1972, US$2 million
remained undisbursed; of this amount about US$1 million has been ear-
marked for equipment on order and technical services while US$1 million
may be cancelled by the closing date of December 1973.
2.      Loan 414-IN, 515-IN, 683-IN, 789-IN - Sixth, Seventh, Eighth and
Ninth Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India Projects.
These loans have supported industrialization in India through a well-
established development finance company. There have been delays in dis-
bursements on the two earliest loans 414-IN and 515-IN as a result of
the business slowdown in the years following 1967. The closing date for
414-IN has been extended a third time to June 30, 1973. That of 515-IN
is currently December 31, 1972, having been postponed from a year earlier.
These postponements have been the result of delays in a few sub-projects.
ICICI has taken steps to overcome delays in disbursements and has been
utilizing the funds provided in the two most recent loans 683-IN and
789-IN at a rate faster than anticipated.
3.      Credit 89-IN - Beas Equipment.   The purpose of this credit is
to provide part of the foreign exchange cost of imported equipment and
services required to develop hydroelectric power from the Beas River,
to extend irrigation in the Punjab and Rajasthan and for associated
construction works. The project is part of a larger scheme for the
integrated development of the eastern rivers of the Indus Basin. The
scheme has suffered delays. The balance of the credit outstanding is to
be spent on items scheduled for delivery over the next 12-18 months. As
a result, we expect to propose extending the present closing date of
December 31, 1972 to December 31, 1973 later this year when the delivery
position has been reviewed.
4.       Loan 614-IN - Tarai Seeds.  This loan to the Tarai Development
Corporation is to assist in the development of seeds of high yielding
varieties of crops. Bids for equipping one of the two seed processing
plants have been received but an award has not yet been made because
of the high bids received; this matter is now under review. Further,
a major difficulty has arisen because of a lack of response to tenders
for land levellings and a mission is now in the field to discuss ways



Annex 1
Page li
in which this work can be carried out. As a result of these various
delays, disbursements are about six to nine months behind schedule.
5.       Loan 615-IN and Credit 153-IN - Telecommnmications III. The
project which was financed 50 percent by a Bank loan and 50 percent by
an IDA credit was designed to assist in financing the teleconmiunicatio1is
expansion program for the first three years of the Fourth Plan period
(1969-1974). Credit 153-IN has been fully disbursed while Loan 615-IN
should be disbursed by the closing date of December 1972. Although
disbursements under our lending have taken place broadly in line with
the regular schedule there have been delays in meeting projected
targets of about nine months for local exchange installations and up
to two years for long distance network, resulting from difficulties
experienced by local factories and delivery delays of some key items.
In recent months the situation has improved especially at the local
factories.
6.       Credit 176-IN - Kadana Irrigation. This project will finance,
in part, the construction of Kadana Dam and Reservoir and the expansion
of irrigation below the dam. It includes land levelling, the cors-
truction of field channels and roads, and a program to support agri-
cultural development. The project is likely to be completed about two
years behind schedule. A major problem has been the failure of the
prime contractor on the dam itself; the Government was forced to dis-
charge this contractor in October, 1971 and to undertake the work by
force account. Since that time the public works department has been
making satisfactory progress. Drainage works in the right bank area
*are likely to be more extensive and more costly than expected and may
not be completed until 1976. The outlook for other components of the
project remains satisfactory.
7.       Credits 191-IN, 203-IN, 226-IN, 249-IN, 250-IN, 278=., and
293-IN - Agricultural Credit Projects in Gujarat, Pun.JLab, Andhra
Pradesh, Haryana, Tamil Nadu, Mysore and Maharashtra. Of these seven
agricultural credit projects, which total US$21609 million, the
Maharashtra project is not yet effective and Ntysore project has only
recently been declared effective (September 25, 1972). With the ex-
ception of the Punjab project which has only a mechanization coxponent,
all are similar in structure, being designed to provide long and medium-
term credit to farmers through credit institutions and the commercial
banks for such on-farm investments as tractors, minor irrigation and
land-levelling. Such projects are characteristically slow disbursing
since they are complex and involve very large numbers of small loans
to individuals, each of which has to be appraised and processed. Never-
theless, implementation and disbursement have been much slower than was
originally anticipated. By September 30, 1972 only US$208 million out
of US$35.2 million had been disbursed under the first of the series to
be approved - the Gujarat project, which became effective in September
1970 and which has a closing date of June 30, 1974. No disbursements



Annex 1
Page 5
have been made in the Punjab project and only relatively small amounts
have been disbursed in the other three projects which have been current
for some time. In all US$6.5 had been disbursed by September 30, 1972.
There are a number of factors which have contributed to tlhe
situation, the most important of which, quantitatively, are the problems
which have been encountered in the procurement of tractors (which account
for almost 30 percent of the credits).
Two events, the imposition by the Government of India of a 30
percent import duty and the realignment of the rates of exchange of inter-
national currencies, were mainly responsible for delays, although diffi-
culties were also experienced in finalizing tender documents. Only in
the case of Gujarat credit did an order for the first tranche of tractors
predate these events and in that case disbursements are being made.   The
effect of the duty was to increase pricesof imported tractors so con-
siderably that doubts were raised as to whether effective demand for
such models remained. These doubts have still to be put to the test.
The exchange realignment was instrumental in distorting bid prices to
the extent that, at the last moment, the Government decided to with-
draw the Puniab tender and to re-advertise. Qnly recently have fresh
bids been received and it is hoped that prices will shortly be adver-
tised to farmers in the case of the Punjab and Haryana credits. Tender
invitations in the case of the other credits are delayed pending the
results obtained in the Punjab case.
It is still uncertain whether the full number of tractors in-
volved in these credits (some 21,000) will, in fact, be required, If
they are not, consideration will have to be given to restructuring the
projects by the re-allocation of proceeds to other components or to
cancellation. The situation should become clearer in the next few
months. If a requirement for net imports remains and if effective
demand has been restored, disbursement should be fairly rapid.
The long delays experienced in disbursing against the mdnor
irrigation components of these credits have stemmed from the need to
establish in the States, Groundwater Directorates capable of providing
the technical advice and appraisal required if an economic utilization
of groundwater is to be obtained and if investments are not to lead to
overinvestment or under-utilization of scarce resources. The establish-
ment and staffing of these organizations has been a prolonged process
but there are now indications that lending for minor irrigation is pro-
ceeding satisfactorily and further delays in disbursement are not anti-
cipated.
In several credits, the delays caused by such time consuming
institutional reform have been exacerbated by resistance to the more
stringent lending terms imposed by the credits which have caused farmers
to seek finance from sources other than those to be refinanced by IDA.



Annex 1
Page 6
This particular problem now seems to have been overcome as interest rates
in the sector and other lending conditions stabilize around the norms
established by these projects.
8.       Credit 230-1N - Agro-Aviatione This project was designed to
improve facilities for aerial spraying of pesticides, as part of Indiats
plant protection program. So far no disbursements have taken place be-
cause the Government is reconsidering the procurement arrangements for
the importation of aircraft. The matter is now before a Cabinet
Committee and the Association is awaiting the Government's decision.
9.       Credit 241-IN - Telecommunications IV. This project is a contin-
uation of Telecommunications III and has been designed to support the
telecommunications expansion program over the last two years of the Fourth
Plan (1969-74). Procurement action for delivery of imported goods in
1973/74 has been largely completed. Disbursement against the output of
local factories was expected to have started by now but has been delayed
on account of production delays. But as production has now begun to im-
prove, the credit as a whole should be fully disbursed by the closing
date of December 1974.
10.      Credit 242-IN - Power Transmission II. This project, a continu-
ation of the project financed by Loan Nor 416-IN is designed to assist
in financing the purchase of equipment and materials required to develop
a power transmission program in nine States under the Fourth Five-Year
Plan. Initial delays have occurred as a result of the Governmentis
effort to standardize procurement, but bids are now being received for
major equipment and more rapid disbursement can be expected. Disburse-
ments are expected to be complete by the closing date of September 30,
1975.
11.      Credit 264-IN - Cochin II Fertilizer. Ths project is intended
to help finance the expansion of fertilizer manufacturing facilities at
Cochin. After initial delays the project is now proceeding about six months
behind schedule. Response to tenders has been disappointing, however, and
procurement difficulties and labor problems could lead to additional delays.
12.      Credit 267-IN - Wheat Storage. The deadline for effectiveness
of this credit, which will provide storage facilities in India's wheat
belt, has been postponed until November 14, 1972. Delays in effectiveness
were caused by difficulties in contracting with engineering consultants
and in the acquisition of sites. Other aspects of the project are being
carried out, and disbursements can be expected to proceed rapidly foUlowing
declaration of effectiveness.
13.      Credit 268-IN - Pochamnad Irrigation. This project comprises
the construction of a dam on the Godavari Rivers a main canal, a distri-
bution system to serve 100,000 ha, agricultural support services and the
construction of village roads. The project is generally proceeding



Annex 1
Page 7
satisfactorily and disbursements are ahead of schedule. Bids for canal
lining contracts were unreasonably high, and the Association and the
State Government of Andhra Pradesh have agreed that the contracts should
be re-tendered,
14.      Credit 279-IN - Gorakhpur Fertilizer , The engineering design
for this project, for the expansion of an urea plant in Uttar Pradesh
is now well advanced and equipment estimated to cost about US$40 willion
has been ordered. Although delivery of some equipment may take loinger
than forecast during appraisal, the project is progressing without serious
difficulties.
15.      Credit 281-IN - ailw ys )a.   This project, consisting of new
and on-going works in Indian Railways investment program for three years
beginning April 1, 1971, is progressing in a satisfactory xanuer. Dis-
bursements are ahead of schedule,
16.      Credit 294-IN - Bihar Agr'cultural 14arkets. This credit, which
will help to finance the establishment of wholesale markets in about 50
towns, was declared effective on July 31, 1972, Disbursements can be
expected to take place on schedule.
17.      Credit 312-IN - Poulation Projgct. This credit, which will
help to finance an experimental, research-oriented population projact
including a nutrition component in selected areas of Mysore and Uttar
Pradesh, has not yet been declared effective. The due data for effec-
tiveness is October 17 by which time the conditions shouild be fulfilled.
A recent mission has reported generally satisfactory progress.
18.      Credit 327-IN - Industrial Imports VII and Credit 328-IN -
Shipping I ProJect. These projects were signed on September 26, 1972.
Disbursements can be expected to follow rapidly following effectiveness,
