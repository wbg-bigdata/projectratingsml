REPUBLIC OF KOREA
APPRAISAL OF A SECOND EDUCATION PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises a second education project in the Republic
of Korea for which Bank/IDA assistance of US$43 million is proposed. A
first education project, assisted under Credit 151-KO extended in 1969, is
helping qualitative improvement in technical and agricultural education.
ii.       The Korean education and training sector, although quantitatively
well developed, has significant weaknesses. These include insufficient
outputs to meet the needs for craftsmen, technicians and some categories of
professionals, such as production engineers and secondary school teachers;
outmoded curricula; and a teaching approach which is over-theoretical due to
the lack of practical facilities. In particular, many institutions do not
have the basic equipment required for an acceptable standard of skill acquisi-
tion. The proposed project would support the first stage of reforms
planned to align education and training more closely to the needs of a
rapidly expanding economy in which agriculture and industry are undergoing
wide transformation. In particular, it would: (a) extend the training capa-
bility of a selected number of agricultural and technical high schools; (b)
expand and improve higher schools 1//junior colleges for sub-professional
training; (c) strengthen university education in the fields of agriculture,
engineering, natural sciences and merchant marine; (d) expand and reorient
teacher education; and (e) assist the programming of planned educational
reforms.
iii.      Specifically, the project would consist of:
(a)  equipment and extensions of buildings for:
-    14 agricultural and 18 technical high schools;
-    10 higher schools/junior colleges for agricultural,
industrial, fishery and nursing training;
-    selected colleges of agriculture, engineering, science
in 9 universities and a college of merchant marine;
and
-    10 junior teacher colleges -/ and 12 colleges
of education;
1/   See Glossary and Chart 2.



- ii -
(b) specialist services and fellowships for carrying out two
pre-investment studies to complete programming in the
fields of health and management education respectively
and for assisting staff development in the project insti-
tutions at the university level.
The project institutions would have a total of 77,220 student places,
of which only 5,900 would be new since emphasis would be on the improvement
of the quality of the output and of the efficiency and productivity of the
sector rather than on expansion.
iv.       The improvement program of vocational education in the agricultural
and technical high schools (grades 10-12) of the project (27,800 student
places and 9,000 student places respectively) provides for the introduction
of new and more practical curricula and the establishment of closer ties
with the agricultural extension and with industry. In addition to their
regular three-year programs, the schools would conduct accelerated training
and evening courses.
v.        The project would assist the re-organization of six higher
schools (grades 10-14 at present) to provide two-year post-secondary techni-
cian courses (grades 13-14) and the improvement of four schools of nursing
(grades 13-15). The re-organization of the higher schools (4,720 student
places) would expand output at the sub-professional level in line with esti-
mated manpower needs, rationalize the system and improve equality of educa-
tional opportunity since all secondary school graduates would be able to
compete for entry into such higher schools. The improvement of a limited
number of schools of nursing (1,200 student places) where training is geared
to the needs of rural areas, together with provision for a pre-investment
study on health education, would be a first step toward comprehensive develop-
ment of medical and para-medical training.
vi.       The colleges to be strengthened as a part of the project have
been selected in accordance with the government's university development
plan for: (a) improving the quality of a limited number of the 71 Korean
universities, giving priority to Seoul National University and to national
universities in the provinces; (b) emphasizing relevance to regional man-
power needs; and (c) continuing enrollment control but making the present
system more flexible. The colleges of agriculture in the project (1,700
student places) would provide teaching and research support to other agricul-
ture colleges and emphasize instruction and research in animal production
and high yielding rice varieties, two fields of special significance to
increased food production. In the colleges of engineering and sciences (12,000
student places), curricula would be modernized in support of the planned
development of heavy and chemical industry. The college of merchant marine
(800 student places) when properly equipped, would update instruction in
navigation and marine engineering techniques in line with plans to promote
the shipping industry.



- iii -
vii.      Ten junior teacher colleges for primary teacher training (8,800
student places) would be equipped to permit the implementation of a training
program designed to prepare the teachers for wider responsibilities in comi-
munity development and for the use of modern instructional techniques. The
12 colleges of education, equipped and expanded as a part of the project
(11,200 student places), would increase the supply of secondary teachers
in accord with estimated needs and promote the institutional and administrative
changes required to give pedagogical training to the increasing number of
graduates from other colleges (agriculture, liberal arts and sciences, engine-
ering), expected to enter the teaching profession.
viii.     The total project cost is estimated at US$70.2 million and the
foreign exchange component at US$47 million or 67% of the total project cost.
This high percentage is the result of the project assisting the improvement
of existing institutions rather than expanding enrollment; this requires a
large amount of equipment and only limited civil works. The Bank Group
would assist in financing the costs of equipment, specialist services and
fellowships and the Government of Korea would finance the costs of civil
works, furniture and local handling and transportation of equipment (US$27.2
million including a foreign exchange component of about US$4 million). Bank/IDA
assistance (US$43 million) may entail a limited amount (US$2 million) of
local currency financing to cover the ex-factory cost of locally manufactured
equipment procured after international competitive bidding.
ix.       A project unit already established under the Ministry of Education
would be responsible for the implementation and overall supervision of the
project. It would work in close collaboration with the Office of Supply,
Republic of Korea, for the procurenent of civil works, furniture and equipment.
The contracts for equipment would be awarded on the basis of international
competitive bidding. Contracts for furniture and civil works would be
awarded on the basis competitive bidding following national advertising
because of the limited sizes involved in each institution and difficulty in
"packaging" contracts to attract foreign bidders. Preferred domestic
manufacturers of equipment would be awarded a margin of preference equivalent
to the existing customs duties applicable to competing imports or 15% of the
c.i.f. price, whichever is lower. Customs duties on most equipment items
are higher than 15%.
x.        In the late 70's - early 80's the project institutions would
supply some 25% of the estimated manpower needs for craftsmen, 20% for sub-
professionals, 80% for agricultural graduates, 30% for engineering and
science graduates, 70% for primary school teachers, and 40% for college of
education graduates. In addition, improved training is expected to contribute
to productivity growth by increasing worker efficiency and reducing the
amount of defective work and accidents. As 70% of the student places to
be equipped are in small towns and rural areas, the project would also assist
in improving educational opportunity and income distribution because in Korea
there is a highly positive correlation between educational attainment
and earnings. In sum, the project would form an integral part of the Bank



- iv -
Group lending strategy to Korea to assist industrial transformation, correct
income disparities between the urban and rural -sectors and support the
infrastructure required to meet these objectives.
xi.       The project would also assist most of the priorities of an education
strategy consistent with Korea's socio-economic needs. By providing function-
ally-designed and well-equipped facilities and reorienting teacher training,
the project would promote the application of relevant curricula and support
administrative and organizational improvements throughout the education
sector. As a result, education would have a more practical emphasis which
would increase its capability of supplying outputs with the skills and attitudes
required by an expanding economy and increased labor mobility by sector, level
and type of employment.
xii.      Bank/IDA assistance (US$43 million equivalent) would meet 90% of the
estimated foreign exchange costs and be equivalent to about 60% of the total
project costs. Disbursements would be made against the c.i.f. cost of imported
equipment, the ex-factory cost of locally produced equipment, 70% of the total
cost of imported equipment procured locally and the foreign cost of specialist
services and fellowships.
xiii.     The project Is suitable as a basis for a credit of US$20 million
and a loan of US$23 million to Korea.



REPUBLIC OF KOREA
APPRAISAL OF A SECOND EDUCATION PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      Bank Group operations in Korea are designed to assist the trans-
formation of the country's industrial base, reduce income disparities
between urban and rural sectors and support the development of the infra-
structure required to meet these objectives.
1.02      Within this framework, an IDA credit of US$14.8 million equivalent
(Credit 151-KO) was extended in 1969 to finance a first education project
to assist qualitative improvements in agricultural, technical and teacher
education and to expand the supply of skilled manpower at the sub-professional
level. After some initial delays, project implementation is proceeding
satisfactorily. The project is now expected to be completed about one
year later than estimated at the time of appraisal and this may require an
extension of the Closing Date (December 31, 1974) by about six months.
1.03      At the time of appraisal of this first project, Korea lacked a
well defined educational plan. The government was conducting a comprehen-
sive examination of its primary and secondary education and initiating the
preparation of a long-term plan. Other studies were analyzing higher
education and certain aspects of agricultural, technical and vocational
training. It became apparent that, before making a major investment in
education, the World Bank Group should await the completion of these studies
and plans. Therefore, the first education project was limited to obvious
high priority items and, in 1971, the Bank carried out an education sector
review to identify investment programs.
1.04      The proposed second project stems from this evaluation which
was followed by extensive discussions with the government before and during
the appraisal mission. The project would assist the first phase of a long-
term plan designed to align education closer to the needs of agriculture,
industry and social development in general. Specifically, it aims at extend-
ing the training capability of agricultural and technical education, increasing
and improving the supply of sub-professionals, strengthening university
education in selected areas, expanding and reorienting teacher education and
assisting in the programming of planned educational reforms. The total cost
of the project is estimated at US$70.2 million and the foreign exchange
component at US$47 million.
1.05      A Bank mission visited Korea in October-November, 1972 to assist
the government in completing the preparation of the project and, simultaneously,
to appraise it. The mission consisted of Messrs. G. Pennisi (economist),
S. Naimie (architect) of the Bank and Messrs. R. Lesire (agricultural educa-
tor, FAO), C. L. Germanacos (educational planner, consultant), J. C. Jones
(technical educator, consultant) and B. R. Teare (engineering education
specialist, consultant).

II. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND MANPOWER NEEDS
Background
2.01      The last decade has been a period of unprecedented economic
growth for the Republic of Korea. Despite limited natural resources,
increases in real GNP have averaged nearly 10% p.a. while, due to a
successful family planning program, population growth has slowed down
from almost 3% p.a. during 1955-1966 to 1.8% p.a. during 1966-1970. Per
capita income, less than US$100 in the late 50's, is now approaching US$300.
The main sources of this growth have been: (a) a labor force endowed with
work discipline and entrepreneurial talent; (b) a sound industrialization
strategy; and (c) an aggressive trade policy resulting in an increase in
commodity exports averaging 39% p.a. from 1962 to 1971.
2.02      As a result of rapid growth, the structure of Korean economy
and society has changed considerably. In 1960, agriculture contributed
some 40% of GNP and manufacturing about 16%; the share of agriculture is
now 26% of GNP and that of manufacturing almost 25%. While in 1960 about
two-thirds of industrial production was from small and medium-scale enter-
prises and one-third from large companies, this ratio was completely reversed
by 1968. Furthermore, some 85% of commodity exports now come from manufactur-
ing compared with less than 20% in 1960. Despite these changes, certain
interrelated problems remain: (a) increasing reliance on foreign capital
inflows has caused difficulties in financial management; (b) industrial
policy needs reorientation towards heavier industry; and (c) the gap between
incomes in the agriculture and urban sectors.
2.03      The Third Five Year Economic Development Plan (TFYP), 1972-1976,
is addressed to these problems. The Plan aims at a more moderate but
better balanced growth to ensure greater domestic financial stability, a
more favorable balance of payments position and improved Income distribution
and food production. These objectives are to be attained by adopting
measures to increase the agriculture growth rate from the 3% p.a. of the
past to 4.5% p.a. and reduce the growth rate of manufacturing from 20% p.a.
to 13% p.a. Exports, projected in the TFYP to increase by no less than 20%
p.a., are expected to continue to be a major source of financing for
domestic investment and growth. GNP would increase by 8.6% over the Plan
period.
2.04      More significant than these quantitative targets are the shifts
in emphasis in major policies initiated with the TFYP. Government policy
for agricultural development is directed toward modernization of this sector,
the share of which in total planned investment is expected to treble, over
that of the Second Plan, 1967-1972. In order to develop wore fully the still
unexploited agricultural potential, it is proposed to expand irrigation,
mechanization and the use of higher-yielding varieties of crops, accelerate
land consolidation and re-arrangement and promote the welfare of the rural
population through community development schemes. The government's policy



-3-
for industrial development calls for moving into intermediate and capital
goods, especially metals, machinery, transport equipment, petro-chemicals
and ship-building, both because light industries are facing increasing
foreign competition and slackening domestic demand and because heavier
industries are expected to increase the net foreign exchange earnings from
exports.
2.05      The success of these policies requires the mobilization of all
available resources, especially human resources. Further development could
be handicapped by a skill gap that would place Korea at a disadvantage in
comparison with other countries by adversely affecting productivity and
costs and her competitive position in the world market.
Manpower Requirements
2.06      One of the main sources of growth and transformation has been
the quality of the labor force (para 2.01) which has adapted remarkably
well to the socio-economic changes of the 60's. This labor force is
relatively young and well educated: about half is under 35 years of age
and of the total employed in 1966 (the year of the latest census), 38% had
received primary education, 29% secondary education and 6% post-secondary
education.
2.07      Unemployment has decreased from 8% of the labor force in 1964
to some 4.5% in 1971 and is expected to stabilize at around 4% in the mid
70's. The occupational distribution of employment, reflecting increasing
demand for skilled manpower, has changed considerably from 1965 to 1970
with the employment of technical and professional workers increasing at 15.5%
p.a., of craftsmen at 8.8% p.a., and of administrators and managers at 7.6%
p.a. while total employment growth was averaging 2.4% p.a.
2.08      Against this background and on the basis of the policies summarized
in paras. 2.03 - 2.04, the government estimates that total employment will
grow from 10 million in 1970 to 16 million in 1986 (or by 3% p.a.) and that
productivity will increase at some 5% p.a. In the non-agricultural sectors,
employment will increase at about 7% p.a., while in agriculture a slow
annual decrease of about 1% in total employment needs to be accompanied by
an improvement of the educational profile of the rural population in order to
sustain the modernization policy (para. 2.04). It is also estimated that
education output requirements over the period 1972-19S6 would be as follows
(Annex 1):



-4-
Requirements (1972-1986) due to
(in thousands)
Level of education        Expansion       Replacement               Total
University                   400               200                   600
Junior College (or
equivalent)                800              100                   900
High School                1,100               700                 1,800
Middle School              1,700            1,100                  2,800
2.09      A comparison carried out by Bank staff between these estimated
needs and the projected outflows of the education system (Annex 1) as well
as the more detailed forecasts made by the Korean Ministry of Science and
Technology (MOST) for certain major occupational categories (Annex 2 and
Chart 1) show that the imbalances are becoming critical. In general terms,
supply is expected to exceed requirements at the university and general high
school level while output at the sub-professional level will meet only half
of the needs projected over the 1972-86 period and the present shortage of
craftsmen may become more severe in the near future. At the professional
level, there could be 6urpluses of liberal arts and social science graduates
and also of certain categories of engineering and natural science graduates
but shortages will continue to exist in some specific categories, such as
production engineers and secondary school teachers, at least until the early
80's.
2.10      In addition to removing these quantitative imbalances, further
growth and transformation of the economy require an improvement in the quality
and flexibility of labor to accompany the increases in the amount of capital
per worker planned for both agriculture and industry 1/ and the greater
mobility between sectors and levels of employment. This improvement is
necessary at all levels, especially in professional categories requiring a
scientific and technological background and training in modern production
methods.
III. THE EDUCATION AND TRAINING SECTOR
Evaluation of the sector
3.01      The Korean education and training sector is described in the
Appendix and the basic data are given in Annexes 3 and 4 and Charts 2, 3 and
4. In summary, the sector has a sound basis for development: (a) comparatively
high enrollment ratios at all levels (see Comparative Education Indicators);
(b) high progression and low dropout and repetition rates; (c) high proportion
1/   On average, the capital stock per worker is increasing by 7% p.a.



-5-
of students in vocational and professional courses at the high school (nearly
50,) and university (about 60%) levels, and (d) an expanding number of
accelerated and in-plant training programs supplementing the formal school
system.
3.02      There are, however, certain weaknesses which affect the system's
capability to meet urgent manpower requirements and long-term socio-economic
needs. In addition to insufficient outputs at the craftsmen and technician
levels and to enrollment re-adjustments required in certain professional
courses (para 2.09), the system suffers from outmoded curricula, the inadequate
pedagogical training of about half of the middle and high school teachers
and the lack of functionally-desi3ned and well-equipped workshops and
laboratories. These deficiencies affect adversely the quality of instruction
at all levels because teaching tends to be too theoretical. As a result,
even where curricula appear to be well balanced, the orientation and content
of instruction can be distorted in the actual classroom situation.
3.03      Cooperation among the Ministries and agencies involved in
education and training 1/ and between the sector and industry has recently
improved considerably but is not yet fully effective. It must be strengthened
if the system is to become an integral part of the programs to accelerate the
transformation of industry and agriculture. Within this context the Korean
Ministry of Education has started to give more empliasis to the practical
and attitudinal content of instruction than to formal examinations. Further
improvement entails the modernization of curricula and facilities and the
rationalization and consolidation of resources at all levels, especially in
vocational and professional courses in high schools, junior colleges and
universities.
3.04      Inequalities in educational opportunity still exist in high and
higher education as between rural and urban areas but are being reduced.
Female participation, now less than 40% in high school and 24% in higher
education, is improving, as middle school enrollnent expands.
Education Policy and StratMX
3.05      The objectives of Korean educational development are indicated in
the TFYP, 1972-76, and in the Comprehensive Long-Range Education Plan (CIEP),
prepared in 1970. The CLEP, although never formally adopted by government,
still provides broad guidance for long-term developments. Emphasis is on
reform, redirection and improvement programs and on the appropriate equipping
and efficient utilization of the physical and human resources at the disposal
of the sector. Expansion in high school and post-secondary education is
envisaged only to meet proven skill needs (para 2.09).
1/   These include the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Agriculture,
the Mlinistry of Social Affairs, the Ministry of Science and Technology,
and the Korean Education Development Institute (KEDI).



-6-
3.06      Priority is given to:  (a)  expansion and improvement of sub-
professional training; (b) improvement of high school education, coupled with
expansion of accelerated and in-plant training; (c) rationalization and con-
solidation of university education with expansion restricted to clearly iden-
tified manpower needs; and (d) movement towards a universal basic education
of nine years 1/. Projections made by Bank staff on the basis of CLEP estimates
and summarized in Annex 3 and 4 indicate the quantitative targets to meet these
objectives. In particular, the projections show: (i) a progressive increase
in the proportion of enrollment in junior colleges as compared with universities;
(ii) reduction in the growth of high school enrollment but with increased use
of diversified curricula and the consolidation of agricultural and technical
high schools as a comprehensive education system gains ground; and (iii) attain-
ment of universal basic education of nine years by 1986. In addition, student:
teacher ratios are expected to be gradually improved throughout the sector
and government participation is planned to increase in the more costly voca-
tional and higher education fields.
3.07      The plans to reach these targets have not yet been fully programmed.
However, the government has prepared an investment program which is directed
toward meeting the priority areas listed in the previous paragraph as
follows:
(a) a number of vocational higher schools (grades 10-14) will be
converted into two-year post secondary (grades 13-14)
institutions, thus increasing enrollment capacity and output
at the sub-professional level;
(b) selected agricultural and technical high schools (grades
10-12) are to function as "demonstration centers" in which
courses are conducted in collaboration with the extension
service and local industries respectively and, at the same
time, more centers for accelerated vocational training are
being established;
(c) enrollment in university education will continue to be
controlled. Improvements will place emphasis on selected
higher education institutions to be developed on a provin-
cial basis in order to promote relevance to national and
local needs and better use of resources; and
(d) the content of primary teacher training (grades 13-14) is
being improved to prepare the teachers for a more effective
role in comnunity development.
1/   The reform of basic education (grades 1-9) is being assisted by USAID
which has sponsored a major study of this level of education and helped
in the establishment of KEDI (see Appendix paras 2-3).



7 -
3.08      The proposed second education project would assist all the aspects
of this program except those related to the establishment of more accelerated
training centers (which are helped by ADB) 1/, by providing appropriate
facilities and equipment and by promoting relevant curricula, organizational
and teacher education improvements. The project would also assist some aspects
of a second stage of the planned reforms. These reforms would give priority
to: (i) creation of a network of post-secondary institutions for sub-
professional training; (ii) further expansion of accelerated and in-plant
training; (iii) conversion of a number of existing small agricultural, tech-
nical, cormercial and academic high schools into diversified or comprehensive
schools; (iv) further improvement in university education to include health
and management education.
F                      development
3.09      Educational institutions are classified into:  (a) national
institutions, financed entirely by the central government; (b) public institu-
tions financed jointly by the central and local governments; and (c) private
institutions financed by private sources with minor assistance from the
public authorities. Details of the system of education finance are given in
the Appendix, paras 30-37, and Annex 5. Total educational expenditure has
increased very rapidly over the last five years (28% p.a. in monetary terms,
or some 16% p.a. in real terms) and is now Won 178.5 billion or 5.3% of
GNP (1972 estimate). Public expenditure on education (Won 125.8 billion) is
equivalent to 16.7% of total expenditure by central and local governments,
with public recurrent expenditure on education absorbing some 22% of total
public recurrent expenditure.
3.10      A projection of future education expenditure (Annex 6), based on the
estimates of enrollment and teacher requirements summarized in Annexes 3
and 4, assumes, conservatively, but on the basis of discernible short-term
developments, that the present low unit recurrent costs will increase
steadily in real terms to reach US$60 in primary education (US$28 in 1972) 2/,
US$140 in secondary (US$68), US$600 in post-secondary education (US$285) by
1986, in order to reflect the improvements described in paras 3.05 - 3.07.
Although expenditures projected beyond 1976 are approximate, the projection
shows that the share of recurrent education expenditure on GNP and on public
finance may decrease from 1976 to reach 5% and 18.5%, respectively in 1986
(5.4% and 24% in 1976).

3.11      Financially, the taain limiting factor to further reforms would
be the size of the capital budget (more than US$2 billion equivalent) 1/
required from 1972 to 1986 to support expansion in enrollment mainly at
the middle school level; it would probably be necessary to *xten8 double-
shif-t working at the primary and middle levels more than ptesently contem-
plated or, alternatively, tb postpone somewhat the date-feet the achievement
of universal basic education of nine years (para 3.06).
IV. THE PROJECT
Objecives
4.01      The proposed project would assist an investment pftogram aimed
at: (a) Improving agricultural and technical high schools; (b) expanding
and improving higher schools/junior colleges for agriculturalt technical,
fishery and nursing training; (c) strengthening university education in the
fields of agriculture, engineering, natural sciences *nd mefthant marine
(d) expanding and improving teacher education; and (e) cotpleting the program-
ming of planned reforms in the fields of health and management education. It
would consist of:
(a) Equipment for and extensions, where required 2/, to the
institutions listed below:
1/   This estimate is based on the assumption that 50% of the nev places
in primary, middle and general high school will be used on a double
shift basis. It is also assumed that double shift working in
vocational high schools will not be possible due to evening and
accelerated courses. The estimate includes the capital cost of the
proposed project as well as the costs for the completion of the first
education project assisted by the World Bank Group.
2/   The civil works included in the project entail primarily rl£etlling
of existing institutions to provide functional workshGp* and labotatories
and a more effective use of the already available facilities.

Project item
4.02      Vocational High Schools.  The proposed improvement of selected
vocational high schools (grades 10-12) would support government policy to
relate the education system to manpower needs and to use existing institutions
as integral parts of agricultural and industrial programs (paras 2.09 and
3.03). As the existing accelerated training programs, including those being
expanded with the assistance of ADB 1/ (para 3.08), are meeting only about
1/   The project assisted by ADB includes five vocational institutes with
a planned output of some 3,000 p.a. There are already about 160 vocational
and in-plant programs which are operated under the supervision of the
Office of Labor Affairs (OLA) and have a total of about 35.000 p.a.
(Appendix, paras 26-28). Developments in non-formal training_for agri-
culture are described in Appendix, para 29. These developments, as well
As tho Axnanslon of non-formal industrial training to reach an enroll-
ment of some 60,000 in 1976 (Appendix, para 28), require increased
coordination with the formal education system (para 3.03).

one third of the total need for skilled workers, the project would assist a
number of agricultural and technical high schools by improving curricula,
teaching methods and facilities and permit the use of the school premises
for short-term courses in addition to their regular programs.
4.03      A number of the existing 115 agricultural high schools has been
selected as "demonstration schools" to be operated in collaboration with
the Office of Rural Development (ORD) of the Ministry of Agriculture.                      *
They are located in areas for which the TFYP proposes major agricultural
investments (para 2.04) and, in addition to their regular three-year
program, give training to adult farmers. In the regular program, 70% of
the time is allocated to agricultural subjects with emphasis on farm practice
and two months in each year are spent in "on'the-job" training. Where
needed, the best graduates may receive financial assistance to establish
their own farms.
4.04      The first project is providing assistance to seven agricultural
high schools with a total of 4,400 student places. The second project
would improve the facilities of 14 additional schools; 11 of these schools
are already "demonstration schools" and the remaining three will become
"demonstration schools" in March, 1973. The project schools at Hongeheon,
Namweon, Jangseong, Seongju, Sacheon and Changryeong do not have adequate
farming land. Although the amount of land required varies from school to
school, the minimum nes.ded is estimated at five ha. During negotiations,
the government confirmed its intention to provide adequate land for these
schools not later than January 1, 1975.
4.05      A new curriculum is being introduced as part of the improvement of
technical education which started with the first education project assisted
by the Bank Group (pa'ra 1.02); it provides for an initial period of basic
training in a trade (e.g., mechanical engineering) followed by two semesters
of specialized training within the trade (e.g., as sheet-metal workers or
machinists), and by a period of supervised specialized training "on the job"
(paras 3.03 and 3.07).
4.06      Full benefit from these changes is hampered by inadequate laboratory
and workshop accommodation and equipment: in many schools from 800 to 90%
of the needed equipment is either lacking or unsuitable. The government plans
to improve only about one-half of the country's 59 technical high schools
(para 3.08). The project would provide the required equipment for 18 such
schools.  Nine technical high schools with a total of 10,000 student places
are being improved (six) or replaced (three) under the first project, making
a total of 27 schools able to implement fully the new type of training.
4.07      These schools have been selected for their economic viability and
development potential on the basis of (a) present and projected industrial
development in their respective vicinities; (b) existing cooperation with
local industries, particularly in regard to evening courses; and (c) recent
employment records of their graduates. Together, the 27 schools would have



- 11 -
an output of some 12,000 graduates per annum from the regular three-year
program and about the same number from part-time courses and would thus help
to meet the need for craftsmen and junior technicians (para 2.09).
4.08      Technical and agricultural high schools not covered by the first
and second education projects are either uneconomical in size or located in
areas with no immediate .prospects for development; a number of them would
be converted to high schools with diversified curricula in a later stage of
the educational reform (para 3.08).
4.09      Vocational High Schools/Junior Colleges.  Projections of manpower
requirements indicate an acute shortage at the sub-professional level (para
2.09). Plans to meet this situation by the creation of a network of junior
colleges (para 3.08) have been only partially prepared; the project would
therefore assist those existing institutions that have been included in an
interim program. Within this framework, the project would assist (a) six
higher schoolsl/ (grades 10-14) that are to be converted to two-year post-
secondary institutions (grades 13-14); and (b) four schools of nursing (grades
13-15) where training is related to the needs of rural areas. Provision
would also be made for a pre-investment study to chart further improvement
in both para-medical and medical training. The government is using its
own resources for the studies required to complete the programming of
expansion and improvement of other types of sub-nrofeRsional training.
4.10      Five higher schools with a total number of 5,700 student places
are being improved and converted into two-year post-secondary institutions
as a part of the first project.  The second project would provide equipment
and extensions for an additional six higher schools, including two agricul-
tural higher schools, one technical higher school, and threw fishery higher
schools2/. Conversion would increase the output from 900 to some 2,200
eraduates per year and assist the post-secondary higher schools/junior
colleges of Korea to meet about 40% of the estimated need in the late 70's.
The conversion would open the higher schools to all high school graduates and
thus improve the equality of educational opportunity and generally ensure a
better level of entry than under the present system. In the case of the
fishery higher schools, however, the two-year post-secondary program would
be followed by one year of apprenticeship at sea before full certification
is accorded to students enrolling in the deck and engineer officers' courses
directly from general high schools. During negotiations, the government
confirmed that the reorganization would commence by March 1, 1974 for the
1/   See Glossary.
2/   The deep-sea fishing industry of Korea (now sixth in the world in terms
of export) is growing very rapidly and becoming one of the major sources
of foreign exchange. It requires an increasing number of well-trained
high and middle level manpower. MOST estimates that the demand for deck
and engineer officers of fishing vessels will be about 500 p.a. during
the TFYP, 1972-76.

technical and agricultural higher schools included in the project and by
March 1, 1975 for the fishery higher schools. 1/
4.11      The output of the 23 existing schools of nursing (about 1,300 p.a.)
falls short of the estimated needs (some 2,500 p.a.) but it exceeds the
present absorptive capacity of the public health system. However, about one-
third of the graduates emigrate. The project would be limited to equipment
for four schools in which training emphasises practice in rural clinics and
health centers; the output from these schools (about 350 p.a.) would be
easily absorbed as a part of the program to improve the productivity and
welfare of the agricultural population (para 2.04). The project schools
would provide a pattern for other schools of nursing following the proposed
pre-investment study on health education (para 4.09).
4.12      Universities.  University development has been largely uncoordinated;
there are 71 universities with a total of 160,000 students, two-thirds of
whom are in private and often small institutions. The government has intro-
duced enrollment controls through a system of "entry quotas" by department,
broadly related to manpower needs, and has established minimum staff and
facility requirements for maintaining acceptable standards. Enrollment control
has been successful but a survey conducted in 1971 indicated that the science
and technological colleges had on average less than 30% of the special facili-
ties needed and the majority had only 10-20% of the equipment required.
4.13      A plan prepared in 1972 aims at:  (a) improving the quality of
selected universities, giving priority to Seoul National University (SNU)
and to national universities in the provinces; (b) emphasizing relevance
to regional needs; (c) changing the present "entry quota" system by department
to a quota system by broader fields, thereby achieving greater flexibility
while continuing enrollment control. The initial program would comprise:
(i) strengthening of selected colleges of agriculture, engineering, natural
sciences and merchant marine with only a modest expansion in enrollment;
and (ii) improvement coupled with expansion of teacher education. As a part
of the overall strategy to promote quality improvements and reorientation
of the education sector toward a more practical content, the project would
assist implementation of the first phase of this plan, by providing equipment
for and extensions to science, technological and teacher colleges of 16
universities (Annex 7) and help the preparation of the second phase by
providing pre-investment studies in the fields of health and management
education.
4.14      Three colleges of agriculture are to be equipped and remodelled
under the project. According to the plan (para 4.13), the SNU college of
agriculture will maintain a central function in higher agricultural education
1/   This difference in date is justified because the revision of the syllabi
of the technical and agricultural higher schools was started in
connection with the first education project while the studies for the
reorganization of the fishery higher schools have begun only very recently.

and accord a specialist service support to the provincial colleges. The
colleges of agriculture of the National Universities of Gyeong Sang and
Jeon Bug function in differeing ecological areas and emphasize training in
animal production and high yielding rice varieties respectively, two fields
of great significance for increasing food production (para 2.04).
4.15      The eight colleges of engineering and the departments of natural
sciences of the nine colleges of liberal arts and science included in the
project would have a total of about 12,000 student places, approximately one
fourth of the 1971 enrollment in these fields. About 1,000 of these places
would be for expansion in those areas, such as production engineering, for
which there is a proven need. The colleges have been selected according
to the plan outlined in para 4.13 and are expected to become centers for
high quality engineering and science education. Their engineering curricula
are being revised to emphasize problem solving and include courses on
engineering economics. During negotiations, the government confirmed its
intention to utilize equipment more effectively by requiring the project
universities to establish "common facilities" for those items which will
be used also for the skill training of the students of the colleges of
education enrolled in technical teacher training programs and that, within
two years from signing of the Credit/Loan agreement, it will inform
the Bank on its proposals for the establishment of such facilities.
4.16      The merchant marine college has recently been relocated and expanded
to 800 student places to meet the need for ship officers and engineers
generated by the growth of the Korean merchant navy. 1/ One year of the four
years program is spent at sea, partly on the college training ship and partly
on commercial vessels. The project would provide equipment for updating
navigation and marine engineering instruction in line with modern techniques.
4.17      Teacher Education.  The implementation of the education policy
described in paras 1.O5 - 3.08 requires an improvement of teacher education at
all levels (para 3.02). In particular, the primary level program needs re-
orientation to instruct teachers in modern methods, such as the use of audio-
visual aids and programmed learning, and to prepare them for their wider
responsibilities in community development (para 2.04). At the middle and
high school levels, improvement and re-orientation need to be accompanied
by an expansion in the output of colleges of education. Since even after
expansion these colleges would be able to meet only about one-half of the
projected requirements, administrative measures should be taken to give
pedagogical training and teaching accreditation to the increasing number of
graduates from other colleges (agriculture, engineering, liberal arts, etc.)
who wish to enter the teaching profession.
1/   The TFYP envisages an investment of nearly Won 50 million (US$350
million) to increase the ocean vessels capacity from 797,000 gross
tons in 1971 to 2,154,000 gross tons in 1976. MOST estimates that
the need of the merchant navy only for ship and engineer officers would
be 300 p.a. during 1972-76 and will reach 500 p.a. during 1982-86.



- 14 -
4.18      The project would provide equipment for 10 junior teacher colleges
for primary teacher training (grades 13-14). The output of these colleges
(4,200 p.a.) would meet about 70% of the estimated needs and the balance
would be supplied by the remaining junior teacher colleges which already have
adequate facilities.  During negotiations the government confirmed its
intention to: (a) review curriculum content and its application to meet the
objectives indicated in the previous paragraph; (b) reorganize practice
teaching so that each trainee would have at least four weeks of actual
teaching; (c) inform the Bank on the outcome of curriculum review and reorgani-
zation of practice teaching within two years from signing of the Credit/Loan
agreement.
4.19      The 12 colleges of education (Annex 7) to be equipped and expanded
under the project would increase their number of student places from 8,200
to 11,200 or to about 40% of the 1977 projected total for the 51 colleges
of education in Korea. As the total output from colleges of education is
expected to fall short of needs (para 4.17), the government should promote
other sources of supply and, to this end, during negotiations has agreed
that within one year from signing of the Credit/Loan agreement, it will send
to the Bank its proposals to: (a) allow students to transfer into teacher
education from other colleges; (b) organize special courses in pedagogy for
degree graduates of other colleges entering the teaching profession; and
(c) grant such graduates the same status as the graduates from colleges of
education.
4.20      Pre-investment studies.  A pre-investment study is required to
recommend improvements in management education. There are 40 universities
offering business administration or management courses to some 23,000 day
students and to practicing managers attending evening classes. In addition,
a number of public and private organizations arrange non-formal management
programs. Differences in quality are wide and some of the courses are not
relevant to the needs of Korea. The project would provide for a team of
experts (15 man-months) to undertake a survey of management education,
plan rationalization, determine investment priorities and prepare possible
projects.
4.21      A pre-investment study is also needed for developments at all
levels of medical and para-medical training (para 4.09). A team of experts
(about 20 man-months) would review the existing training provisions 1/ and
determine investment requirements and possible projects to better relate
the health education and the health care systems.
4.22      Staff and staff developmuit.  The vocational high and higher
schools included in the project are properly staffed and there are adequate
provisions for the training of technical and agricultural instructors. Under
the technical assistance component of the first education project, instructors
already in service are receiving short-term courses in teaching methods and
in the use and maintenance of equipment. Furthermore, practicing extension
agents and personnel from industry give part-time courses in the agricultural
an' technical high and higher schools.
1/   There is an enrollment of some 16,000 in universities and some 8,000
in sub-professional courses.

4.23      To assist curricula development and ensure proper use of equipment
in the colleges of agriculture, engineering, natural sciences, and education
(paras 4.14, 4.16, 4.19) a sum of US$300,000 would be included in the
project cost for staff development. It would be used for fellowships abroad
for staff and, where required, to invite foreign specialists to Korea. During
negotiations the government has agreed that, within one year of the signing
of the Credit/Loan Agreement, a staff development plan for the project univer-
sities will be sent to the Bank for review and that this plan will include
provision for the organization of workshops and seminars on the operation and
maintenance of equipment.
V. PROJECT COST, FINANCING, AND IMPLEMENTATION
Cost Estimates
5.01      Construction cost estimates have been derived from recent school
and university building costs in Korea. The average cost per square meter
is estimated at US$70 which compares well with construction costs in other
Asian countries. The schedules of accommodation are functional and
economical, e.g., utilization factors for the workshops and laboratories
of the high and higher technical schools are estimated at about 75% based on
a 40-hour week; this utilization factor is high but allows for a sufficient
nmargin of flexibility in time-table scheduling. Estimates of equipment costs
are based on preliminary equipment lists prepared by the Korean authorities
for each project institution and reviewed during appraisal. These estimates,
which take account of the equipment already available in the institutions,
are reasonable. The estimated costs and foreign exchange component of the

5.02      Contingency allowances (Annex 9) add 10% for unforeseen factors
to the cost estimates of site development, construction, furniture and
professional fees and 7% to the equipment estimates.  Foreign exchange costs
of 1972 are expected to increase by 5% p.a. and local costs by 6% p.a.;
therefore, an additional 8.7% contingency is included. For the entire
four-year period of project implementation (Chart 5), all contingencies
would be equivalent to about 17% of the basic cost of the project before
adding contingencies.
5.03      The foreign exchange component has been calculated as follows:
(a) site development, 10%; (b) construction, 20%; (c) furniture, 20%;
(d) equipment, 90%; (e) professional fees, 10%; and (f) specialists'



- 18 -
services and fellowships, 80%. Including contingencies, the foreign
exchange component is estimated at about US$47 million or 67% of the total
project cost.  This percentage is high because the proJect is for improvement
of existing institutions (para 4.01) rather than for expansion of enrollment
and therefore entails a large amount of equipment and only a limited amount
of civil works (para 5.01).
5.04      As the project would assist schools already in operation, it
would generate only very little additional recurrent expenditure, about
Won 3.5 billion p.a. or 1% of the estimated total recurrent expenditure on
education projected for 1976.
Financial Plan
5.05      The financial plan proposed by the government provides for World
Bank Group assistance to finance the costs of equipment, specialists'
setvices and fellowships only, with the costs of civil works, furniture,
professional fees and local handling and transportation of equipment to be
financed from the government budget. By major components, the various
parts of the project would be financed as follows:

Iml_e_entation and Procurement
5.06      The existing Project Unit in the Ministry of Education (MOE) would
be responsible for the overall supervision of the project and liaison with
the Bank. The Project Unit would be strengthened to supervise adequately
the preparation of designs for civil works and of equipment lists, execution
of construction and delivery and installation of equipment. In particular,
during negotiations, the government has agreed that within six months from
signing of the Credit/Loan agreements, at least four architects, five engineers
and ten technical and agricultural education specialists, trained by the tech-
nical assistance team provided as a part of the first project (para 4.22) will
be appointed to the Project Unit. A panel of equipment specialists has been
already established to assist in the completion of the lists for the universi-
ties included, in the project (Annex 10).
5.07      Civil works would follow the space standards patterned on those
of the schools of the first project for similar institutions or be acceptable
to the Bank in all other cases. Similarly, equipment lists for the tech-
nical and agricultural high and higher schools would be based on the master
lists of the first project for similar institutions. In all cases, designs
for civil works and lists of furniture and equipment would be reviewed by
the Bank before procurement.
5.08      Procurement of equipment would follow Bank guidelines for interna-
tional competitive bidding. It is expected that most of the equipment
contracts would be awarded to foreign suppliers. Domestic manufacturers are
becoming competitive in selected areas of simple science equipment; after
international competitive bidding, they may be awarded contracts for about 5%,
or US$2 million equivalent, of the total estimated equipment cost. Preferred
domestic manufacturers would be allowed a preferential margin of 15%, or
the existing customs duty, whichever is the lower, over the c.i.f. price of
competing imports. Customs duties on most of the items to be procured under
the project are higher than 15%. Contracts for civil works and furniture
would be awarded on the basis of competitive bidding following national
advertising; this is justified because of the small size of the contracts
involved at each institution and the difficulty in "packaging" them to
attract foreign bidders.
5.09      Satisfactory implementation of the project depends on the timely
preparation of design and equipment lists and on an adequate phasing of
procurement. As government procurement is the responsibility of the Office
of Supply, Republic of Korea (OSROK), the measures described in para 5.06
to strengthen the MOE project implementation capability, need to be comple-
mented by actions to (a) reinforce OSROK and (b) improve cooperation between
OSROK and the MOE.
5.10      In particular, the foreign procurement section of OSROK is not
adequately staffed to handle the procurement of the equipment included in
the project. During negotiations, the government has agreed that within



- 20 -
nine months of signing of the Credit/Loan Agreement, six additional procure-
ment specialists will be employed in the foreign procurement section of
OSROK for the purposes of the project and an implementation schedule
jointly agreed upon by the MOE and OSROK will be forwarded to the Bank for
comments.
Disbursements
5.11      The proposed credit of US$20 million and loan of US$23 million
would finance 90% of the foreign exchange component and the ex-factory costs
of equipment contracts awarded to domestic manufacturers after international
competitive bidding. Bank Group financial assistance would be equivalent
to about 60% of the total project cost and would be disbursed to meet:
(a) the c.i.f. costs of directly imported equipment or the
ex-factory cost of locally manufactured equipment;
(b) 70% of the total cost of imported equipment procured
locally; and
(c) 100% of the foreign expenditure cost of specialists'
services and .:ellowships.
The above percentages would be adjusted as necessary to spread disbursements
over the implementation of the project and to ensure full disbursement. The
estimated disbursement schedule is shown in Annex 11 and the credit/loan
and project summary is given in Annex 12. The Bank loan will be disbursed
only after full disbursement of the IDA credit.
VI. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
6.01      The contribution of the project to economic growth is indicated
by its role in meeting manpower requirements, both quantitatively and
qualitatively. In the late 70s and early 80s, the institutions assisted
by the Bank would supply some 25% of the estimated annual manpower needs
for craftsmen, 20% for subprofessionals, 30% for engineering and science
graduates, 70% for agricultural graduates and primary school teachers and
40% for college of education graduates.  With improved facilities, curricula
and teaching methods, the contribution of training to productivity would
increase.  A survey conducted by the Research Institute for Industrial
Development of Korea indicates that, on average, (i) a worker gains 20% in
efficiency from training; (ii) training brings about a significant reduction
in the rate of defective work (10% to 40%, depending on the industry); and
(iii) the accident rate among trained workers is about half of that among
untrained workers.



- 21 -
6.02      The project would help reduce economic and social disparities by
equipping institutions (70% of the project student places) in small towns
and rural areas. This would improve educational opportunity and social
mobility because, as shown by a recent wage survey in Korea, there is a
positive correlation between educational attainments and earnings. Income
distribution effects can also be anticipated from the improvement of agricul-
tural, nursing and primary teacher training programs in line with the plans
to increase the welfare of the rural population.
6.03      The project would contribute to educational development by assisting
the priority areas of a long-term plan consistent with Korean socio-economic
needs. In particular, by providing well-equipped workshops at various
education levels and reorienting teacher training, the project would promote
the application of relevant curricula and support administrative and organiza-
tional improvements throughout the sector. As a result, education would
have a more practical emphasis which would increase its capability of
supplying outputs with the skills required by a modern economy characterized
by increasing labor mobility among differing categories and levels of
employment (para 2.10).
VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
7.01      During negotiations, agreement was reached with the government
on the following points:
(a)  the provision of adequate farming land to the agricultural
high schools, the reorganization of the higher schools,
the establishment of "common facilities" in the project
university, the review of the primary teacher training
program, and the administration measures to give pedagogical
training and teaching accreditation to graduates from
colleges other than the colleges of education entering the
teaching profession (paras 4.04, 4.10, 4.15, 4.18 and 4.19);
(b)  staff development and training in maintenance and operation
of equipment for the project university (para 4.23);
(c)  the strengthening of the Project Unit and of the foreign
procurement section of OSROK and the preparation of a project
implementation schedule jointly agreed by MOE and OSROK
(paras 5.06 and 5.10).
7.02      The proposed project provides a suitable basis for a development
credit of US$20 million on standard IDA terms and for a loan of US$23
million to the government of the Republic of Korea for a term of 30 years
with a 10-year grace period.

THE EDUCATION AND TRAINING SECTOR
Structure and Management
1.        The structure of education comprises (Chart 2):
(a)  compulsory Primary School (grades 1-6) for the 6-11 years
age group;
(b)  Middle School (grades 7-9) for the 12-14 years age group,
with entry open to all primary graduates since 1971;
(c)  High School (grades 10-12) for the 15-17 years age group,
on a selective entry basis from middle school. This
divides into (a) general high schools (with arts or
sciences emphasis), and (b) industrial or vocational
high schools which include technical, agricultural, com-
mercial, fishery, comprehensive, and other vocationally-
oriented institutions;
(d)  Higher Education of two levels, with competitive entry
for high school graduates:
(i) Junior College education with two or three year
courses mostly in vocational subjects, including
primary teacher training;
(ii) University or College level with courses of four
or six years duration.
2.        This structure is now under review.  A USAID-sponsored pilot ex-
periment concerned with the feasibility of compulsory nine-year basic educa-
tion is now in the planning stage. For this purpose, a para-government
agency, the Korean Education Development Institute (KEDI), has been set up
to formulate objectives, develop curricula and related materials, and review
teacher education in terms of the education technologies the Institute may
propose to promote the reform.
3.        Educational planning requires improvement, being excessively dis-
persed among agencies. Each Bureau or Directorate at the MOE (Chart 3) is
responsible for short-range planning and the programming of its subsector
while the Economic Planning Board and the Ministry of Science and Technology
draw up long-range development plans. The integration of the short-range
programs and their relevance to the long-term socio-economic objectives and
manpower requirements is not adequately carried out by the MOE Office of
Planning and Management which reviews programs only when they have moved
into the operational stage. In addition, the functions of KEDI have recently
been broadened to embrace planning and development at high school level and
to initiate or carry out research activities covering the entire education

system. The broad responsibilities given to KEDI could lead to overlap and
duplication with the functions of the Bureaus of MOE.
Efficiency of the Sector
4.        Education indicators show Korea in a highly favorable light for a
country with a per capita income of about US$300. The literacy rate rose
from 22% in 1945 to 85% in 1966. Enrollment ratios in 1971 were relatively
high at all levels (Chart 4):
Total         As %                       % in
Enrollment      of Age         %          Private        T:P

Middle School    1,602            60%         39%           45%         1:39
High School         675           30%         35%           55%         1:29
Higher.Education   199             8%         24%           68%         1:19
Total          8,283           62%
/1   Including over-age students.
5.        Promotion and completion rates are impressive at about 90% or
more at each grade and level and reflect the high motivation of Korean
students. Progression rates at 70% from primary to middle, 65-70% from
middle to high school and 27% from high schools to higher education are
good.
6.        The distribution of students between academic (51%) and vocational
and comprehensive (49%) high schools is satisfactory. At university level,
the proportion of students in engineering (23%), agriculture and fishery
(8%), sciences (15%) and medical studies (9%) is well balanced.
7.        The majority of teachers, 90% in primary and 80% in secondary
education, are qualified by government's standards but about half of those in
secondary and higher education have little or no pedagogical training. In
terms of the role primary teachers are expected to play in promoting
community development, their training needs to be broadened.
Productivity of the Sector
8.        If the productivity of the sector is measured in terms of the
outnut's relation to existing and projected manpower needs, then the formal
education system reveals serious quantitative imbalances as indicated in
para 2.09 of the main report. More significant than these quantitative



APPENDIX
Page 3
imbalances is the deficiency of the output in terms of the required level
of skills and attitudes. These weaknesses can be attributed partly to the
content and orientations of curricula but more specifically to the theoretical
and outdated teaching methodologies and techniques used.
9.        These shortcomings are compounded by the over-sized classes and
high teacher-pupil ratios (Annex 3) which make practical and small-group
teaching difficult to organize and supervise even in those instances where
the physical facilities are adequate. Consequently, one of the major tasks
of KEDI is to consider the feasibility of introducing new educational tech-
nologies, such as programmed learning and team teaching, which might offset
these deficiencies at reasonable cost.
Curricula and Facilities
10.       The curriculum of the primary school has recently been revised
and is again under review by KEDI. If it could be applied as designed, it
would be a well-balanced curriculum with adequate allocation of time to
science and practical learning related to the environment of the children.
In the existing classroom situation, however, it can become rather sterile
and theoretical.
11.       This is true also of the middle school curriculum where the time
allocated to the practical subjects (agriculture, handicrafts, elements of
wood and metal work) may be increased by the school director from 15% to
35% of the weekly timetable to suit local conditions. Constructive applica-
tion, however, is possible only with appropriate workshops and equipment
and teachers specifically trained to use a practical approach to teaching.
12.       The same comments can be applied to the general high school
curriculum and its application in the existing 397 such schools with their
337,000 students and a teacher-pupil ratio of 1:31. The curriculum com-
prises a common core of subjects for all students complemented by a wide
range of elective or optional areas. The inadequacy of the physical
facilities and teacher skills limits the range of the elective subjects,
particularly the practical options. Given the facilities, the general high
school curriculum could be easily broadened to enable the school to convert
to a wholly diversified or comprehensive type of secondary school.
13.       Industrial or vocational high schools comprise a variety of types
of vocational institutions which can be grouped in the following broad
categories:

14.       The three-year courses in a variety of industrial skills in the
technical high schools provide for eighteen months of basic training followed
by twelve months of specialized training in the school and six months of
supervised training in industry. The school curriculum provides for 40%
of general education, 25% of technical theory and 35% of workshop practice.
The general plannihg of courses and curricula is good but the lack of
equipment prevents the schools from producing skilled workers who will
eventually rise to lower supervisory positions.
15.       The post-secondary higher technical schools or junior colleges
train engineering technicians, fishery personnel, and nurses.  There is
need to expand the training for this level of skilled worker.  Most existing
higher schools offer five-year courses (grades 10-14) but better results
and increased output can be achieved by re-organizing the schools to
offer only the two-year post-secondary course (grades 13-14).
16.       The principal objective of the 115 agricultural high schools
(grades 10-12) with their 40,000 enrollment and about 11,000 annual output
is to give farming skills to youths. They are successful in so far as 75%
of the output enters farming. In the "demonstration" schools (para 4.06 of
the main report), 70% of the total teaching hours are devoted to professional



APPENDIX
Page 5
agricultural education and half of this time to practice on the school
farm. In addition, on-the-job training is carried out for two months
annually. The resources (e.g., facilities, instructors) of the "demonstra-
tion" agricultural high schools are intended to be integral parts of the ag-
ricultural and community development programs. An official agreement exists
between the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Agriculture and
Forestry for the operation of these schools.
17.       The agricultural higher schools (grades 13 and 14) train middle
level technicians. Some of the schools have not yet been reorganized to
phase out grades 10-12. The balance between the general and professional
subjects is 10-20% and 80-90% respectively in the two-year program, and
37-47% and 53-63% respectively in the five-year program. Each student must
have more than 60 days on-the-job training during vacation.
Teacher Education
18.       Primary teacher training is carried out in 16 junior teachers'
colleges (grades 13-14) with an enrollment of some 12,500 and output of
about 6,000. This output, with a limited expansion in the mid-70's, would
be adequate to reduce the present 1:56 teacher-pupil ratio to 1:40 in 1986
with class size decreasing from an average of over 60 to about 45. School
buildings are adequate. The curriculum is satisfactory but its application
is limited by the lack of equipment and by the over-emphasis on music and
the fine arts in the optional areas. In consequence, insufficient time is
given to preparing the students in the practical areas of home economics,
industrial arts, agriculture and health care which are more relevant to the
teacher's expanding role in community development. In addition, trainees
need to have more practice teaching.
19.       Secondary teacher education is provided in 51 university colleges/
departments of education and separate teachers' colleges. Enrollments were
some 16,000 and the output 2,300 in 1971 and are planned to be about 25,000
and 6,000 respectively by 1986. This output would still be inadequate to
meet the projected needs of middle and high school teachers (about 11,000-
12,000 p.a.). Output could be raised to 7,000 in 1980 if some further
expansion is initiated in 1976. This assumes (i) that the middle school,
or the upper part of basic education if this becomes a nine-year course,
will continue to be staffed by university graduates, and (ii) that the
teacher:pupil ratios (Annex 4) would be improved to ensure better quality
teaching, particularly of the technical and other practical subjects. The
gap could be closed by a much more rapid expansion of teachers' colleges
but this is not recommended: (i) the graduates of the other colleges (liberal
arts and sciences, engineering, agricultural, etc.) can become teachers
after pedagogical training; and (ii) if this job avenue was closed to the
graduates mentioned above, there could be unemployment problems in these
categories.

Higher Education
20.       Of the total 199,000 enrollment in higher education in 1971 only
36,500 (18%) were enrolled in junior colleges. This includes 12,500 in
the junior teachers' colleges; of the remainder, the majority (14,600 or
60%) were enrolled in science, para-medical, engineering and agricultural
courses with an output of 8,180 and a further 5,330 (15%) with an output
of 1,300 in three-year nursing courses. These figures suggest the need
for a more rapid increase in junior college education than in universities.
21.       Enrollments of 155,300 (excluding some 6,700 in graduate studies)
in 71 university level institutions show 61% enrolled in the sciences,
engineering, agriculture, fishery, marine and business studies:

22.       At the university level, the imbalances are mostly in the depart-
ments within the schools themselves rather than between the schools although
enrollments in business studies and social science appear to be rather high
in terms of likely long-term needs.
23.       There are serious limitations in workshops, laboratories and
equipment. It is estimated that the higher education institutions in
engineering and sciences have less than 30% of the minimum norms and stand-
ards for facilities and equipment set by the MOE in 1970 (para 4.12 of main
report). Until this is remedied, the over-theoretical approach to instruc-
tion will continue.

Non-Formal Training Activities
24.       Since the formal system was unable to respond to the needs for
craftsmen and technicians, various Ministries have increased their non-formal
training programs.
25.       In 1971 the MOE had 135 Higher Trade Schools for youths, with some
24,000 trainees, attached to primary, middle or vocational high schools.
Courses are of 3 to 36 months' duration depending on the trade. The schools
were considered successful and the establishment of another 45 such trade
schools is under consideration.
26.       A Vocational Training Bureau established under the Office of
Labor Affairs has responsibility for skilled worker and lower technician
training carried out in 105 vocational training institutes and 59 indus-
trial firms (in-plant training). In 1971, some 35,000 persons received
training but of this total only 1,400 (19% of the target figure) were at
the lower technician level.
27.       The courses vary in length from one or two weeks (refresher and
supervisory courses) to one year (basic and correspondence courses). Stu-
dents who pass the appropriate terminal examinations are licensed in one of
four grades according to the level of instruction given. The Central
Vocational Training Institute is responsible for the training of instructors
who may serve either in schools, vocational training institutes, or indus-
trial plants. The regular course of two years' duration (annual output 60)
is supplemented by short refresher and other courses for more experienced
students.
28.       Targets for OLA activities during the planning period 1972-1976
are given below:

These planned developments have not yet been programmed.
29.       The Office of Rural Development (ORD) of the Ministry of Agricul-
ture and Forestry is responsible for the agricultural extension service
and uses mass media (mainly radio) and over 6,000 agents for information
dissemination and counselling. The Ministry of Agriculture is considering
establishing a total of 130 farmer training centers, three of which are
functioning. This plan and its relationship with the "demonstration
schools" should be reviewed before making further investment as the agree-
ment between the MOE and the ORD provides for farmer training courses to
be conducted in the "demonstration schools" and a number of the other
agricultural high schools are to be converted to middle or diversified
high schools.
Education Finance
30.       The system of financing.  Educational institutions are classified
into "national", "public" and "private" on the basis of their source of
finance (para 3.09, main report). The central government finances the
salaries of teachers in primary schools and in all national institutions
above the primary level and 50% of the salaries in public secondary schools



APPENDIX
Page 9
with the other 50% being financed by the local authorities. The most
recent comprehensive data on actual expenditure relates to the period
1967-70 when one-third of the resources devoted to education was derived
from the private sector and two-thirds from the central and local authori-
ties. The contribution of foreign assistance is, quantitatively, insignifi-
cant: about 1% of total expenditure. The share of the central government
to total national effort for education has averaged about 57% and local
authorities have provided an additional 10%; this distribution is likely
to change somewhat in the future as secondary education expands.
31.       Legislation requires the central government to earmark for primary
and secondary education 13% of taxes on personal income and business profits 1/
and to distribute the funds as follows: (a) 11.5% for primary education
expenditure on construction and materials; (b) 1.5% for secondary education
to supplement the resources of the provinces. As universal primary education
has been already achieved and the enrollment pressure is moving toward middle
school, it would be advisable to allow a more flexible distribution of the
funds.
32.       Private sources cover the cost of education in private schools
(Won 25.4 billion in 1970) as well as fees and textbooks and some materials
in public and national schools. Fees, charged at all levels, are assessed
and collected by parent-teacher associations in accordance with set guide-
lines which take account of parents' abili`ty to pay for their children's
education. Although the system developed for channelling private contribu-
tion to education is generally satisfactory, it appears that private
sources concentrate on the less expensive forms of education, such as
general high school and higher education in the humanities and social
science.
33.       Total expenditures.  Annex 5 summarizes by source developments in
total educational expenditure from 1967 to 1972. The increase has been
rapid, in both monetary (28% p.a.) and real (some 16% p.a.) terms, with the
result that share of education on GNP has increased from 4.2% in 1967 to
5.3% in 1972. Two main factors have been at the basis of the rapid growth
of total educational expenditure: (a) the enrollment expansion and (b) the
rising real costs which have accompanied the quality improvement programs
already initiated. Although the available data indicate a high marginal
propensity of households to spending on education which could permit the
use of more private resources for education, the rapidity of the increase
indicates that control should be applied on enrollment growth so that
further expansion and major reforms are economically conceived and phased.
34.       Recurrent expenditure absorbs some 75%-80% of total educational
expenditure but information is not available for a complete analysis of its
distribution by level and type of education. Nevertheless, the central
1/ These taxes account for about two-fifths of central government tax
revenue.



APPENDIX
Page 10
government budget shows that in recent years the shares of primary and
university education in total recurrent expenditure have increased. They
are expected to decrease considerably in the near future as the primary
school-age population decreases, university expansion is controlled and
emphasis is given to expanding middle school and improving high schools and
junior colleges.
35.       Salaries absorb some 80% of recurrent expenditure in national and
public institutions and about 70% in private institutions. Throughout the
civil service, however, salaries are low relative to those given in other
sectors of the economy for the same level of qualification. In spite of
recent increases, the education sector has had difficulties in recruiting and
retaining qualified personnel.
36.       Partly as a result of the low level of teacher salaries and of
the large number of students per teacher, unit recurrent costs are low by
international standards. On average, the estimated 1972 unit recurrent
costs 1/ are:
(US$)
Primary Schoo'l    28          Middle School       68
High School         36         University         285
A sample survey indicates that in 1970 unit recurrent costs in private
institutions were 30% and 10% higher than in public scho4ls at the primary
and middle levels but slightly lower at the other levels. It is expected
that unit costs need, at least, to double in real terms over the next
14 years to provide for the presently planned qualitative improvements.
37.       Capital expenditure on education fluctuated at around 20% of total
educational expenditure in the late 60s and has increased to almost 25%
more recently. These ratios are comparatively high for a country of Korea's
level of development. However, to meet enrollment expansion, especially at
the middle school level, capital expenditure has been inadequate as indicated
by the large average class-size and the lack of instructional equipment.
Furthermore, at the secondary and especially at the post-secondary level
capital expenditure has not been properly directed: in particular, elaborate
and large buildings have been constructed while the need for functionally-
designed and well-equipped workshops has been neglected.
