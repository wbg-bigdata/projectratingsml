HEFfRhEDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
FO_R A WRIA-GNI PORT RESTRUCTURING AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommenda-
tion on a proposed loan to the People's Republic of China for the equivalent
of $150 million to help finance the Shanghai Port Restructuring and Develop-
ment Project. The loan would be at the Bank's standard variable intere;t
rate, with a maturity of 20 years, including five years of grace. The pro-
ceeds of the loan would be onlent through the Shpnghai Municipal Govenmment
(SMG) to the Shanghai Port Authority (SPA) for 20 years, including five years
of grace, at an interest rate equal to 90 percent of the Bank's variable
interest rate per annum and a 0.75 percent commitment fee per annum on the
outstanding balance. SPA wvould bear the foreign exchange risk.
2.        Backaround.  One of the most important challenges facing the -anage-
mont of China's ports is how to adapt the ports to changing circumstances
brought about by economic reform. While China has done well to expand physi-
cal facilities in the past decade, port operations, by and large, are insuffi-
cient to respond to continuing rapid growth in the economy. This is partly
due to poor hinterland linkages and outdated port management and operational
procedures. The Government is giving high priority to modernizing and expand-
ing ports' capacities to facilitate the country's foreign and internal trade.
Ports in China are gradually becoming more market oriented; this process
started with decentralization of large ports in 1985. The Shanghai Port
Authority (SPA) was among the first batch of ports that were moved from the
Central Government to the Municipal Governments, with increased autonomy pro-
vided to the managements in financial and operational areas. Notable progress
has since been witnessed in enterprise management reforms, investment plan-
ning, pricing policy, and environmental protection.
3.        Shanghai Port is the largest port in China, tenth in the world and
is the hub of international and domestic regional trade for China. Accounting
for a substantial part of the country's manufacturing output, especially for
the export trade, the Shanghai area generates a large volume of port traffic,
amounting to over 140 million tons in 1991, of which about 100 million tons
were handled at SPA's facilities comprising some 140 berths on the Huangpu
River, many of them in the city center. SPA's traffic volume is expected to
increase to 135 million tons by the year 2005. To handle this growth and to
minimize the environmental impact of port operations on the city by gradually
transferring city center cargo operations to outlying areas, SPA drew up a
long-term plan for developing port facilities away from the Huangpu River,
initially on the Yangtze River and later in Hangzhou Bay south of Shanghai
city. This plan was reviewed by an international panel of experts jointly set
up by SPA and the Bank. The panel endorsed the broad direction of future
development of port facilities proposed by SPA in its plan. The sites
selected for development under the proposed project have been approved by the
Ministry of Communications (HOC) and the Shanghai Municipal Government (SMG)
and incorporated in the Metro Master Plan for Shanghai.



-2-
4.        SMG and the Bank have been closely associated to develop an Economic
Reform Action Plan aimed at rationalizing the future pattern of the city's
development and at establishing the basis for the Bank's assistance to the
Municipality. Great emphasis is placed by SMG on the development of Pudong,
the area east of the Husagpu River, which is seen as providing the opportunity
and the cornerstone for the restructuring of Shanghai's enterpriass and the
reorientation of urban growth away from the city center. SMG also attaches
considerable importance to the transfer of city center port operations to
locations outside the Huangpu River on both environmental and land use consid-
erations.  But a major obstacle to SPA doing so up to now hts been the finan-
cial burden involved in developing new facilities, particularly when SPA would
get no compensation for the land surrendered by it. SMG has recently decided
that a major part of the proceeds from the auctioning of such surrendered land
for alternative uses would be given to the entity affected. This should
enable SPA to plan for an accelerated transfer of its operations away from the
city center. The proposed project is thus an integral part of Shanghai's
reform and restructuring process.
5.        Lessons Learned from Previous Bank ODerations.  Of the seven port
projects in which the Bank has beon involved in China so far, only the first,
namely, the Three Ports Project (Loan 2207-CHA), is fully implemented. Physi-
cal implementation was in general problem-free and there were substantial cost
savings due to bids being lower than appraisal estimates. The project perfor-
umnce audit faulted the procurement process leading to selection of less than
fully qualified contractors; it also identified a need for long-term strateaic
port investment planning. These lessons are reflected in subsequent port
projects in Chlna. Also, the development of a long-term development plan for
Shanghai port was a precondition to the appraisal of the proposed project.
Subsequent projects have met the need for several studies in the port and
shipping svbsectors addressing both physical planning needs and operational,
institutional and financial aspects and have included, in particular, a con-
tainerixation study, an intermodal cargo distribution study, and a port opti-
mization study. Recent investments in conttiner terminals have benefited from
the results and recommendations of these studies. The Government is also
carrying out a study to set up a port costing and management information sys-
tem under bilateral grant financing. A study focusing on the future strategy
for port development in the southern half of China's coast is also currently
being carried out by Chinese experts under Bank guidance.
6.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank Group's assistance strat-
egy for China assigns high priority to removing infrastructure bottlenecks and
to introducing financial and management reforms to increase utilization of
existing facilities, and to modernizing and expanding transport facilities.
The Bank is involved in promoting well planned intermodal transport operations
and avoiding pollution and keeping the environment clean. The proposed proj-
ect is consistent with the Bank's objectives. In addition to supporting the
Government in Implementing efficiency improvement measures and focusing on
capacity expansion, the Bank is broadening its strategy to assist in the
design and implementation of institutional and sectoral reforms covering pric-
ing, deregulation of services, transfer of advanced technology, and investment
planning. Thus, the Bank's efforts have been instrumental in developing,
designing and carrying out these studies, mainly with the cooperation of
Chinese experts, in order to develop local expertise for continuing attention
to policy issues.

7.        Proiect ObJectives.  The proposed project will focus on:  (a) ratio-
nalizing the long-term development of the port and the use of its facilities
by gradually shifting port operations aWay from the congested city center and
by promoting terminal specialization; (b) providing needed additional capacity
in a rational, optimal and environmentally sound way; (c) increasing effi-
ciency by introducing modern techniques of operational and financial manage-
ment; and (d) providing a basis for the Bank to continue its dialogue (i) with
the Government on the development of the most appropriate strategy for the
future development of ports in China and (ii) with SPA on the long-term plan-
ning* development and operation of terminal facilities in Shanghai port. As
port operations are shifted out of the city center, it will rele&se valuable
urban waterfront land for other more appropriate commercial purposes.
8.        Proiect Descrintion.  The proposed project consists of:  (a) formu-
lation and implementation of an action plan for restructuring the existing
port facilities on the Huangpu River to rationalize their use and gradually
move cargo operations away from the city center; (b) the provision of new and
replacement cargo handling equipment (for axisting terminals) to improve cargo
handling efficiency and promote terminal specialization; (c) measures to
improve SPA's financial condition through tariff restructuring, computeriza-
tion of accounting, auditing and budgetary control; (d) construction of new
terminals (first stage) at Waigaoqiao and Luojing, and the procurement and
installation of the necessary cargo-handling equipment for operating the ter-
minals; and (e) technical assistance and training, particularly in the areas
of institutional and financial reforms.
9.          - cifically, the project would financet  (a) the provision of
equipment for four berths in the planned new container/break-bulk general
cargo terminal of Waigaoqiao; (b) the construction of, and the provision of
equipment for, coal berths at Luojing; (c) the purchase of equipment both for
replacement and for additions to the existing fleet in the present port areas
including the Guangang and Baoshan terminals constructed under the ongoing
Ningbo-Shanghai Ports Project (Ln 3006-CMA); and (d) technical assistance and
training in the areas of corporate planning, financial management, tariff
restructuring and operations management.
10.       Proiect Imnlementation.  Project implementation will be the respon-
sibility of SPA, under the general supervision of MOC. SPA is being assisted
by the Third Harbor Engineering Investigation and Design Institute in the
design of the Luojing and Waigaoqiao facilities. Construction supervision
will be undertaken by the Capital Construction Department of SPA. External
consultants will assist SPA in appropriate areas. The project cost is esti-
mated at $424.3 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of
$195.8 million equivalent, of which the Bank will finance $150.0 million. A
breakdown of costs and financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and
methods of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule
B. A timetable of key project proceosing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in China are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is
also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 11120-CEA, dated November 23,
1992, is being distributed separately. The project is expected to be com-
pleted by the end of 1998, with a loan closing date of June 30, 1999.
11.       Actions Atreed.  During negotiations, SPA agreed to: (a) install, by
December 31, 1994, a port costing system based on the results of the ongoing
Port Costing and Management Information System study and restructure tariffs



-4-
by June 30, 19951 (b) carry out, by October 31, 1994, a cargo unitization
study; (c) complete, by December 31, 1994, a study for shifting bulk fertili-
zer handling away from existing city center facilities, prepare an action plan
acceptable to the Bank by December 31, 1995, and thereafter implement itt
(d) take all steps to: (i) generate sufficient funds to cover operating
costs, deot obligations and to achieve a self-financing ratio of not less than
20 percent for 1993 and 45 percent thereafter, (ii) incur additional debt only
when the debt service ratio is at a minimum of 1.4 for 1993 and 2.5 thereaf-
ter, and (iii) maintain an annual working ratio of 61 percent or better com-
mencing fiscal year 1993; and (e) send to the Bank a proposed corporate plan-
ning system by June 30, 1994, and, tailing ilto account the Bank's comments,
implement it by June 30, 1995. Retroactive financing of up to $15.0 million
is proposed to enable SPA to proceed with the procurement of some items of
equipment for Waigaoqiao where the first berth is expected to be ready for
operation by early 1993; retroactive financing would apply to payments made
after June 30, 1992.
12.       Justification and Risks.  While the Shanghai port facilities along
Huangpu river ate experiencing congestion, the traffic at the same time is
increasing. The main focus of the economic analysis was, therefore, on the
ieixefits from relieving congestion in the port. The proposed project will
yr.ald quantifiable benefits from savings in cargo handling costs, ship time
(both waiting and operating time), and cargo time. In addition, there will be
large benefits from reduced environmental pollution in the case of coal and
other equipment for the rehabilitated berths. The weighted average economic
rate of return of this project is 36.7 percent, with the returns on individual
components ranging from 17.5 percent for coal terminals to 52.5 percent for
bulk fertilizer berths. The container berths will also have a high rate of
return of 49.9 percent. The main project risk is possible delay in construc-
tion or equipment procurement, but, on the basis of the preparations already
made by SPA and its past record, this risk is not considered to be a serious
one. On the institutional side, SPA could face considerable financial risks
if it does not adopt managerial/financial reforms in a timely manner. In
order to mitigate such risks, agreements were reached with SPA on actions to
be taken to improve the tariff system to reflect costs and on institutional
improvements, which would enable SPA to take appropriate remedial measures in
a timely manner. These improvements should help SPA to achieve financial
viability.
13.       Environment Aspects. Most of SPA's existing facilities are located
along the Huangpu River and surrounded by high density residential and commer-
cial neighborhoods. This has generated complaints from the local population
about dust, noise and vehicu3ar traffic.  New terminals planned under the
project away from the Huangpu River will help mitigate the situation. The
quality of the water of the Huangpu River, particularly in the lower reaches,
is poor and the underlying sediment is contaminated due to a combination of
untreated sanitary sewage, storm water drainage and industrial effluents from
small enterprises being dumped into the river. The quantities of wastewater
thus discharged into the river system in Shanghai are estimated at approxi-
mately 1.3 million tone of industrial effluents, 610 million tons of sanitary
sewage and 0.5 million tons of ship waste per annum. The Bank is addressing
these problems through the Shanghai Sewerage Project (Ln 2794/Cr 1779-CHA),
the Ship Waste Disposal Project (Ln 2391-CXA GEF 10398-CHA) and a proposed
Shanghai environment project.



14.       As required by national laws, SPA undertook environmental impact
assessments (SZAs) of the proposed developments at Luojing and Waigaoqiao
through the Shanghai Environmental Protection Sciences Research Institute.
The reports were completed in 1939, and have been reviewed and approved by
SMG. Care will be taken to ensure that the engineering designs of the new
terminals and the technical specifications of the equipment to be procured
will incorporate the necessary mitigating measures prescribed in the EIAs.
SPA agreed, during negotiations, to implement the required mitigative mea-
sures, operate appropriate environmental protection facilities, and monitor
compliance with Central Government and Shanghai Municipal environmental laws
and regtlations.
15.       The anticipated impact of the proposed Jevelopments at Luojing and
Waigaoqiao on the hydrological regime is minimal. The land-side facilities at
Luojing will be constructed in an area currently bermed for coal ash waste
disposal, while Waigaoqiao is in a .ainly agricultural area. Wharves are to
be constructed of the open-pile-structure type for minimal effects on the
currents and the littoral zone and for minimal dredging in the future. Even as
early as 1982, the state of the marshlands and littoral zone, which includes
the project sites, was found to be relatively weak and has not been rated by
experts as a wetland resource, probably due to the impact attributable to
industrial effluents having been dumped in the area in the past.
16.       Three hundred and seventy families at the site of the Waigaoqiao
terminal have already been resettled in new housing constructed by SPA.
Resettled families were given financial compensation in addition to new hous-
ing. Discussion with mambers of resettled families selected on a random basis
revealed that the resettlement terms were, if anything, generous and satisfac-
tory.
17.       Proiect Sustainability.  SPA has a good record of providing adequate
resources, human, financial and organizational, to maintain its assets. It
has a well established maintenance organization with a reasonable level of
funding, and as a result its facilities and equipment are adequately main-
tained. With a future capital expansion program in litie with economic devel-
opment in the region, SPA will, however, face additional funding requirements.
Under the ongoing and proposed reform process, increasing port activities and
greater financial autonomy, SPA is capable of meeting its increased financial
demands. The proposed project should be a sustainable investment as it
focuses on much-needed major capital expenditures, supported by institutional
development and training.
18.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
