Block 1: Project Description
1. Project development objectives (see Annex Ifor key performance indicators):
The objectives of the project are sustainable natural resources management, in particular of crop and range land in severcly
degraded zones, and agricultural productivity improvements, attained with greater involvement of resource users in
development programs. The participatory approach, tested by ODESYPANO in the North-West region, will be integrated
in three pilot CRDAs (Regional Agriculture Development Offices of the MOA), each operating in major agro-climatic
zones of Tunisia, in an effort to improve natural resources management; new procedures will also be established to design
and implement policies for sustainable natural resources management over the long term.
The strategies for achieving project objectives are:
(a) improve natural resources management, preserving resources and, where feasible, helping to reverse degradation, by
developing integrated land management practices, controlling land erosion and introducing new technologies to increase
on-farm income;
(b) improve  rural communities' standard  of living  and  promote  better-targeted  and  more  durable  investments  by
implementing Participatory Development Plans (PDP) that strengthen partnership between the administration and local
communities and increase ownership and responsibility on the part of beneficiaries; and
(c) support MOA  decentralization by introducing the participatory approach at the CRDA  level, and provide tools to
enhance policy analysis and improve project planning and implementation for sustainable natural resources use.

2. Project components (see Annex 2 for a detailed description and Annex 3 for a detailed cost breakdown):
The project will test approaches for subsequent upscaling into a long-term  national strategy to enhance natural resources
management and improve agricultural productivity through a participatory approach. The project will have the following
main  components:  (a) Natural Resources  Management Operations.    First, the  project will finance  Participatory
Development Plans (PDP) prepared by local communities (Unites socio-territoriales, UST), assisted by the CRDA's
technical staff, to address their priorities for soil and water conservation, agricultural and pastoral development, small-scale
irrigation systems and other rural infrastructure, and women's support activities. Second, the project will finance erosion
control and water recharge investments in the three selected CRDAs, mainly on public lands, as part of the Government's
national soil and water conservation strategy, to protect the areas where a participatory approach would be tested; and
(b) Institutional Strengthening, at both the CRDA and central levels, to support MOA human resources and inforrnation
systems development, and to adjust the incentive framework for sustainable resources management.

TUNISIA                                                                               Natural Resources Management Project
3. Benefits and target population. (see attached maps ofproject area)
*   Project Benefits. Not only will the project have a positive environmental impact by conserving and, where possible,
restoring natural resources, but it also will support revenue increases for small-holders in fragile rural areas among the
most disadvantaged in Tunisia. The main project benefit will be a tested and demonstrated method for participatory
and sustainable natural resources management that could be adopted on a national scale. Also, participation by users
is the most effective way to manage collective and shared natural resources sustainably. Improved management of soils
and pasture would reduce loss of soil fertility, erosion and dam sedimentation, as well as enhance vegetative cover, thereby
increasing the value and consequent productivity of natural and physical capital. The direct benefits of the project would be
on-site productivity gains and the indirect benefits would be reduced off-site costs of erosion. The project will also integrate
all relevant agencies into the project planning, design and implementation process and thus permit the identification and
leveraging of cooperative solutions. Finally, through the project, decision-making power will be devolved to the local level,
providing greater incentives for local communities, interest groups and individuals to invest in natural resources management.
*   Project Area. Three selected project areas, each representative of a major agro-ecological zone and socio-economic
system (the humid and diversified north, the dry agro-pastoral center and the arid, predominantly pastoral south),
covering approximately 300,000 ha in all will benefit from an improved participatory natural resources management
and monitoring system and associated durable investments developed and implemented over the life of the project.
Criteria for selecting the project zones were: (a) a high level of resource degradation; (b) a low degree of development;
and (c) the existence of an agricultural potential for sustainable productivity increases and production diversification.
The areas are on the lower end of the national poverty spectrum, with relatively high population density, high land
fragmentation and high labor emigration.
*   Target Population. The direct beneficiaries of the project will be some 20,000 families (112,000 people) living in the
project areas organized as USTs. A UST refers to a local community comprising a number of families that hold
individual or collective rights over certain territorially-defined natural resources (water, land, pastures, etc...), and
whose social cohesion is sufficient for their representatives to make commitments on behalf of the whole community.
A limited intervention area has been chosen to ensure adequate implementation capacity of the communities and
organizations participating in the new strategy for natural resources development. Small farmers will benefit from
improved water supplies and pastures, enhanced on-farm and off-farm incomes, from strengthened producer and
common interest group ("professional" organizations), and from  increased influence in the prioritization of
development and natural resource management investments. Criteria for selecting specific locations and populations to
participate in the project will include the definition of USTs of sufficient cohesion that community participation can be
organized, and the subsequent interest and willingness of the UST to participate in the project and to support an action
plan designed on the basis of community priorities and investment technical feasibility.
*   Assistance for Women. The project is designed to pay particular attention to women's needs. Their participation
would be fostered through special assistance from animatrices. This would assure that women's views are taken into
account in decision-making for both on-farm and community-level developments. In addition to general production
development, separate funds available within the existing legal framework (i.e. Investment Code and Regional
Development Program) will be provided for women specifically to support small-scale individual or collective projects.
This component will be entirely financed by the Government budget and will be closely monitored dunrng project
implementation.

4. Institutional and implementation arrangements:
Implementation period: 5 years: 1998 - 2002
The bank has appraised the Project Implementation Plan and found it satisfactory.
Executing agencies:
Implementation coordination will be through the Ministry of Agriculture's General Directorate of Finance and Incentives
(DGFE). However, the major part of direct project implementation will be undertaken by the three CRDAs (Jendouba,
Kasserine and Medenine). Moreover the project will support decentralization, and the design and implementation of more
flexible budgetary procedures to increase CRDA autonomy.
Project coordination:
•   At the field level, participation will be catalyzed by community workers, namely "animators" and "animatrices", who live
near the communities (UST) they serve (each would cover about 10 UST). Animators will coordinate the involvement of
technical specialists and help local communities, through an interactive process, to prepare Participatory Development Plans
which will prioritize local needs, define actions, specify investments and clarify the responsibilities of the stakeholders.
Multidisciplinary technical teams, trained in participatory methodology, will assist communities to identify, technically
feasible activities, and guide the process towards sustainable participatory management of natural resources.
*   At the regional level, a Project Coordinator for each of the three CRDAs will be responsible for project
implementation. Project implementation will be based on annual contracts, signed by the the Project Coordinator and
Community Representatives, after regional annual programs have been accepted by the CRDA Advisory Committee
(ComitW Consultatif) which will include representatives from the Communities.
*   At the central ministerial level, a Project Implementation Unit (Unite centrale de coordination, PIU), headed by a
Project Manager, will be set up in the MOA within the DGFE and will liaise with the three CRDA's Project
Coordinators. The PIU will also be responsible for the implementation of the EU-financed Integrated Rural
Development and Natural Resources Management Program.
Project oversight (policy guidance, etc.).
At the central level, a National Steering Committee (Comitt national de concertation, CNC), directed by the Minister of
Agriculture (or his designate) will be established not later than September 30, 1997, with the DGFE providing the
Secretariat. The Steering Committee will include technical and financial representatives from the Ministries of Agriculture,
Environment, Finance, Interior and Economic Development.
Accounting, financial reporting and auditing arrangements:
DGFE, which will have overall coordinating responsibilities for project implementation, will set up a project information
system and maintain all project-related accounts, in accordance with sound and internationally recognized accounting
principles and practices satisfactory to the Bank. The project accounts will be audited annually at the CRDA and PIU
level, by the General Auditor from MOF (Contr6le general des finances) which has been auditing similar Bank projects in
the past and proved acceptable. In addition, financial statements will be prepared on a semestrial basis at the CRDA level
and sent to the PIU not later than January 15 and July 15 of each fiscal year. The Special Account records will be kept by
PIU along with the SOEs sent to the Bank for disbursements under the Bank loan. Audited financial statements will be
submitted to the Bank, with the audit report, within six months after the end of the Borrower's fiscal year.
Monitoring and evaluation arrangements.
Project implementation will be monitored by DGFE. However, as part of the institutional development component, the
project will strengthen M&E capacity at CRDA level to provide MOA with adequate tools to enhance policy design and
analysis, as well as improve planning through: (a) developing a limited number of performance indicators closely related to
the project's specific objectives; (b) involving major stakeholders, including local communities, in the development of
impact indicators; and (c) developing local area information networks at CRDA level, as building blocks of a wider network
of natural resources information at national level (Banque nationale de donnees sur les ressources naturelles/IDRN).

6. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
With a GDP per capita of $1790, and an average GDP growth rate of 4.5%, Tunisia is a fast-growing middle-income
country. Income distribution, however, remains unequal as rural incomes are about one third of those in urban areas. The
economy is diversified with industry making up 32%, agriculture 18% and services 50%. Tunisia's fragile natural resource
base supports an agncultural sector which contributes substantially to economic output (18%) and trade (15%), and to income
generation for the rural population. Although the percentage contribution of agriculture to the economy has been steadily
declining, this is because the rest of the economy has been growing so rapidly. In fact agricultural value added has been
rising at about 5% per year. From 1960 - 1991 agriculture's contribution to the economy has fallen from 24% to 18%, and
has since declined even further. Over the same time period, agricultural employment has fallen from 50% to 26% and the
role of agriculture in exports has fallen from 60% to 15%.
The structural adjustment agenda initiated in 1986 has officially been completed and the achievements are substantial. The
fiscal burden of input subsidies has fallen with price liberalization. Output price policy has become much more market-
driven. Sector institutions are evolving, driven by large shifts in the role of the public sector. The Government is
disengaging from direct production to focus on planning, regulatory and public investment functions. There are positive
indicators that the sector is responding to these structural changes: private investment has increased and rural poverty has
fallen substantially.
The remaining priority issues on the agricultural reform agenda are as follow:
•   Increasing Competitiveness. Competitiveness in agriculture must begin with production efficiency. For this purpose pnvate
investments need to be facilitated, especially to permit farmers to diversifv into higher value products. Research and extension
will be critical vehicles to the process of introducing and upgrading production techniques. Marketing structures must also
become more efficient if Tunisia is to be a competitive supplier of agncultural products.
. Sustainable Natural Resources Management. Despite decades of government effort to protect natural resources, climatic and
human factors (mainly over-exploitation and inadequate management practices) have led to significant resource degradation.
It is currently estimated that about 47% of agricultural land is eroded, that 20% of rangelands have disappeared since 1972.
that 24% of shallow aquifers are over-exploited and that the irngation cfficiency rate in some small perimeters is only 40%.
Tunisia's fragile natural resources--water, soils and forests--need better management to prevent them from becoming a
constraint to both macroeconomic and rural income growth.  Improvement is needed both in implanting participatory
management and in strengthening administrative capacity to deal with the social, cross-discipline, decentralized and
information-demanding nature of natural resources management.
. Efficient Delivery of Agricultural Serviccs. Tunisia is in a transitional phase betveen an era when agricultural scrvices were
provided by the State and an era when the State will have withdrawn from delivery of many services in favor of pnrvate sector
provision. The time is nrght for the MOA to develop its strategies for moving in the medium-term towards a broader spectrum
of public and pnrvate delivery mechanisms for agricultural services. with concrete actions to both focus the public sector and to
strengthen and promote private sectors interventions.
The Government will address these issues in the IXct Plan for Economic Development (1997-2002), whose main goals are:
(a) a better sharing of responsibilities between public and private sectors; (b) human resources development and
management; (c) involvement of all stakeholders in development choices, (d) regional development; and (e) environment and
natural resources preservation.

7. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
The Ministry of Agriculture (MOA), which has devoted considerable public funds to natural resource management, recognizes that
past conservation efforts have failed to achieve their objectives. Since 1970, more than I million hectares (out of 4.8 nilion ha of
arable land) have been treated and soil and water conservation public investments are averaging US$35 nillion annually. MOA
now wishes to reorient its rural development strategy from top-down planning in favor of a collaborative approach with resource
user groups. User groups have been promoted first with rural potable water and tubewell irrigation perimeters, but are still at
a formative stage among forest users and soil conservation groups, and remain to be extended to rangeland users. To
support its policy, GOT is revising the legal framework. For instance, a new Soils Code has been approved (Loi n° 95-70
du 17juillet 1995) along with its application decrees, which permits the administration to carry out soil conservation works
in collaboration with farmers and farmers' groups.
The project will focus on sustainable natural resources management in particular crop and range land.  The gravity of the land
management situation varies from region to region, with the most threatened being the arid and semi-arid regions of Southern and
Central Tunisia and the mountainous areas of Northern Tunisia, where the project will be implemented. More specifically the
project will
•    identify management solutions to problems of sustainability and productivity of farmlands and rangelands use through
cooperation between beneficiaries and CRDA technical staff.
*    support decentralized regional rural development so as to improve public investment profitability and sustainability, and
increase beneficiary participation in decision-making. This would in turn require more flexibility in planning and
implementing project activities and a multidisciplinary approach.
*    enhance the M&E capability at CRDA  level to build up the knowledge base so as to enable decision makers at all levels
to improve the efficiency and impact of their programs.

8. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:
To control land-based resource degradation, the following alternative solutions have been considered:
.    A  central planning approach.  This is the predominant MOA  approach to date, characterized by publicly funded soils
and water conservation programs, the establishment and expansion of protected areas, the assumption of better
management by the administration when degradation becomes critical, and the enforcement of legislation leading to the
exclusion of users from protected areas. This top-down approach has been rejected because: (a) it has already been
tried for decades and found wanting; (b) it fails to build beneficiary "ownership"; and (c) it entails high management
costs for the GOT. For the same reasons, the project has rejected 'passive participation approaches" characterized by
centralized decision-making, with the participation of local communities limited to labor, financial contributions or the
provision of information;
.    A  nation-wide varticipatory approach.  The costs, institutional arrangements, and agro-ecological focus of the existing
participatory models do not suggest expansion on such a scale without piloting. Therefore the project has been
designed as a first phase of a program to integrate the participatorv approach in three CRDAs representative of
Tunisia's agro-ecological diversity;

a focus on sustainable natural resources management.
Effective coordination between these projects would be sought at CRDA levels. In addition, three other agricultural sector
projects are planned: a Second Agricultural Investment Loan for $50 million [FY98], a Water Sector Loan for $80 million
[FY991 and an Agricultural Support Services Project for $35 million [FY2000].
10. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design:
World Bank experience in Natural Resources Management indicates that:
.   All relevant stakeholders must be committed to the project.  In this case, stakeholders include the Ministry of
Agriculture (and to a lesser extent other related ministries), NGOs active in the project area, international donors
(World Bank, EU, FAO, KfW, FIDA, CFD) and, most importantly. ]ocal communities which represent the end users of
natural resources (with special attention to the inclusion of the poor. women and youth);
.   Extensive participation of beneficiaries during planning, implementation and evaluation helps instill "ownership" and
ensures that services are significantly more relevant and responsive to local conditions, thereby ensuring success;
*   Animators must be of high quality and receive training in participation if they are to collaborate effectively with farmers
to co-create innovative solutions to natural resource management problems. Furthermore, additional time and resources
are needed to establish an effective institutional framework for participation and participatory M&E;
.   There should be only one umbrella implementing agency (in this case the PIU at the Ministry of Agriculture);
.   It is easier to produce community development plans than to implement them. Project design must therefore take into
account factors that could cause delays (e.g., procurement procedures, inadequate budgetary allocations, staff shortages
and training); and
.   The key unit for local action must have local legitimacy. This is reflected in the process of local definition of local
communities, rather than the automatic reliance on the Douar (Community) which is an administrative definition.
The proposed project took the above lessons into account in its design and implementation set-up.

I. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership:
*   Public commitment to participatory natural resources management at the ministerial level.  Government sees the
project as a test phase before expansion to a nation-wide program.
* Findings of an extensive survey of local community priorities and needs have been built into the project design.
*   Broad participation of stakeholders from each agro-ecological zone in project preparation, including a widely-attcnded
National Seminar (June 1996).
*   The ongoing commitment of the MOA in implementing participatory approaches in the Northwest Mountainous Areas
Development Project.
.   MOA undertaking of two major studies, the first to define CRDAs' medium-term planning needs and the second to
design and implement, within the DGFE, a M&E system for rural and agricultural development projects.
*   MOA agreement that certain design features will be critical for project success. Specifically: (a) the three CRDAs
will be granted significant autonomy for project implementation; (b) the project implementation team will be integrated
into the existing CRDA structure; (c) training of trainers and of extension agents will begin prior to project
implementation; and (d) PIU will be limited to three high-level staff working on this project.

12. Value added of Bank support:
*   Analytical and strategy work conducted by the Bank (CEM and CAS) concludes that management of natural resources
needs to be addressed in order to avoid a potentially serious constraint to growth in Tunisia's strategic sectors. In the
agricultural sector, further improvements will be difficult without implementation by the MOA of cost-effective
participatory approaches to natural resource management. The Government has requested Bank involvement in
designing this strategy in the agricultural sector. The proposed project also fits well with the Government's and Bank's
objective of poverty alleviation since its main beneficiaries would be small-scale farmers in rural areas where poverty
is concentrated.
*   The Bank is well placed to assist. It is one of the few development partners that combines ingredients that will favor a
successful intervention -- international experience in participatory approaches, financial resources adequate to support
a program which airms ultimately at a national scale of implementation, a grasp of sector-level policies that need to be
included in reformulation of resource management strategies, and the weight to foster administrative choices to
diversify skills mixes and decentralize decision making.
*   The Bank would also permit the definition, in conjunction with EU which is financing CES interventions in the same
zones, of criteria for selecting publicly financed investments (mainly hill-ponds and spate irrigation works), thus
improving the methodology used by the administration toward greater participation and cost-recovery.
•   The Bank's cross-country experience will be particularly important in designing administrative support to community
management of natural resources. The MOA has experience with several models, but their costs, institutional
arrangements, and agro-ecological focus do not recommend them for expansion to the scale needed. The MOA is now
seeking improvements through fuller integration of administrative support into the activities of the MOA's
decentralized units (CRDAs).

Block 3: Summary Project Assessments (Detailed assessments are in the project file. See Annex 8)
13. Economic Assessment  X   Cost-Benefit Analysis: NPV=US$ 10.4 million,   Eli Cost Effectiveness Dl  Other
(see Annex 4):                                          ERR=I 3.7%                    Analysis
In economic terms, the impact of the project actions are computed on the basis of incremental expenditures related to
quantifiable outputs, i.e. increased agricultural production, increased fodder production and increased availability of water
for both consumption and irrigation and also costs for activities for which benefits are not included because they are not
easily quantifiable. Economic analysis indicates a 13.7% ERR (18% and 15% in the northem and central areas, 9% in the
more marginal Medenine area). Sensitivity analyses indicate that, at the estimated levels of production, the overall return
would continue to be economically acceptable, even with a two-year delay (10.5%). Switching values (at 10% OCC)
indicate that the project would withstand 26% increase in costs or 20% reduction in benefits. The ERR calculations are
conservative because costs include erosion control, sand protection and rural roads, but corresponding benefits (off-site,
indirect) are not quantified.
Fiscal impact.
The fiscal impact at project maturity indicates that:
.  The incremental recurrent and investment expenditures continuing after project implementation would average
US$2 million per annum. These include the cost of maintaining the monitoring and evaluation system of the Project,
replacing vehicles and equipment starting year 2003, and the added extension and refresher training services for
follow-up and supervision of project activities in the three CRDAs.
.  In addition, increased tax revenues would accrue from  marketing activities resulting from  improved agricultural
productivity and increased employment opportunities. Moreover, the Government would also gain from institutional
strengthening, such as the implementation of the M&E, which should improve budget efficiency as benefits are
extended nationally. These fiscal benefits, which are not quantified, would at least partially offset the incremental
recurrent costs.
The fiscal implications from the above analyses are considered bearable. Indeed, benefits come from better conservation
of natural resources, thereby maintaining the productive base and from improving the sustainability of agricultural
production in marginal areas. The latter would outweigh any marginal increase in expenditures. Furthermore, and in
order to avoid any net increase in fiscal demands, the results could be used to differentiate future programs between
marginal areas, focusing on those areas until more favorable comparative advantages become self-sustaining.

.................... .............I....................................... ................I................ .................................................................... ..................................I......... . ..I P1.... ........
Since project investments in natural resources conservation are not directly revenue earning for the Government, no overall
financial rate of return for the project has been calculated; the budget impact has been dealt with above.
To assure farmers' participation in project operations, however, appropriate incentives are necessary and financial returns
to their investments have been calculated based on about 30 farming models corresponding to the major crops in each of
the three regions. The resulting farm budgets include production costs and yield of one hectare of a specific agricultural
product. The models describe crop intensification activities and land use changes, such as converting marginal cereal
lands into tree crops, converting natural range into Sulla pasture and improve intensification ratios in irrigated areas in
favor of fruit and vegetable production. The farm budgets indicate that all of the proposed actions are profitable and that
the incremental income earned should enable individual farmers to contribute at the levels proposed to the cost of physical
developments. Ratios of incremental benefits to costs range from 1.4:1.0 (olive and apple grove intensification) to 5.0:1.0
(olive/barley and broad beans), while rates of return vary from about 15% for olive and apple plantations, to over 50% for
broad beans.
In order to take into account the integrated aspect of natural resources, rates of return have also been calculated for four
UST models, based on the aggregation at the community level of the various farm models corresponding to existing or
potential agricultural activities of the region. As expected, the retums to communities vary on a regional basis, from 20%
in the arid south to 43% in the sub-humid north. From the financial standpoint it should clearly be easier to obtain
community adherence to project operations in the north, but the lower returns in the south should also be sufficiently
attractive to farmers given the limited opportunities for alternative investments there.

15. Technical Assessment:
The project is technically sound.
.   Tunisia has extensive experience and national expertise in the field of natural resources management and technical
packages exist for agricultural development, soil and water conservation, rangelands improvement, and reforestation.
There is also extensive experience in the traditional management of soils and water (local know-how) from which
appropriate solutions have been selected for incorporation in this project.
.   The poor achievements of projects and initiatives in this field have resulted not from the technical aspects of natural
resource management but from their failure to address the social and institutional dimensions. It is this gap that the
project specifically has addressed through extensive national and international expert attention in the preparation
phase.
*   To improve project technical performance, finance would also be provided for adaptive research programs on new
techniques of soil and rangelands management better responding to community needs, as well as on socio-economic
topics, either by public or private contractual arrangements.
*   The institutional arrangements proposed have been developed with much stakeholder participation and are in line with
the decentralization process of MOA initiated in 1989.
.   Project cost estimates have been developed on the basis of actual local or border prices collected during project
preparation and include physical and price contingencies of 20%.

16. Institutional Assessment:
a. Executing agencies:
* The Tunisian Ministry of Agriculture is technically very advanced, well staffed with qualified and experienced
personnel, and adequately supported by training institutes. Its commitmnent to decentralization is demonstrated by the
creation of quasi-autonomous CRDAs, that are now the key implementing agencies for agricultural and rural
development at the Government level. The proposed project will strengthen decentralization of program and budget
management to CRDAs, and strengthen their staff capability in participatory management through training and
recruitment.
*   Implementation monitoring will be assured at the central level in the MOA by a Steering Committee (CNC) with
technical and financial department representation from MOA, as well as from other Ministries involved in the Project,
namely MOF, MOED and MOE.
*   Provision is made for formal consultation and coordination with vanrous stakeholders including local communities,
with other departments of MOA, other stakeholders at the CRDA level and relevant Ministries (Intefior, Finance,
Environment, Health and Education) at the regional level (Gouvernorat).
b. Project management:
*  Project management will be carried out by the PIU to be established within the DGFE/MOA, and staffed with
employees experienced in economic, agricultural, and sociological evaluation. At the regional (CRDA) level, project
management will be through a Project Coordinator reporting directly to the DG of the CRDA (Commissaire). At the
local level, management will be by local Development Committees (Comite de developpement, CD) and animators.
*  A  Special Account will be opened at the Central Bank of Tunisia in Tunis.  The Authorized Allocation is
FRFIO million, representing about four months of project expenditures. To facilitate financial management of the
large number of geographically dispersed and small-scale investments to be carried out at the community level with
user co-financing, the 90-days Special Account procedures will be applied. Advances of funds will be allocated from
the Special Account and the National Budget to the CRDAs not later than March 31 of each fiscal year. The PIU will
be responsible for instructing the Central Bank of Tunisia to make advance payments to the CRDAs through the
Special Account. The amount allocated will depend on the annual work program which will be presented to the Bank
for approval not later than September 30 of each fiscal year. For the replenishment of the advance, each CRDA will

prepare SOEs justifying incurred expenses for review by the PIU before submission to the Central Bank which will be
responsible for submitting replenishment requests to the Bank. Based on the SOEs and financial statements sent by
the CRDAs, the Central Bank will make subsequent advances to CRDAs. Supporting documentation would be
retained at the CRDA level which will prepare certified financial statements on a semestrial basis to justify the use of
the advance. The Special Account records will be kept at the PIU level.
The CRDAs and the DGFE have adequate capabilities in financial systems and internal controls, and will keep project
accounts. Annual audits of the project will be performed at CRDAs and PIU which will retain records of all transactions
under the Loan for which they are respectively accountable.

17. Social Assessment:
Project preparation provided an initial definition of community priorities in relation to natural resource utilization.
Between July and November 1995, a multidisciplinary team of eight persons, including two social scientists (one female
and one male), spent several days in each community of a sample of 27 UST and carried out Rapid Rural Appraisals with
semi-structured interviews and farming systems surveys. A specific questionnaire, to assess the role of women in the use
of natural resources and agricultural production was also used. Project implementation will proceed by identifying
interested USTs as well as their major needs, so as to create comprehensive community development plans (PDP). This
process, in which the "animators", "animatrices"' and CRDA participatory planners work together to ensure the inclusion
of marginalized groups, rural poor, and women, and stakeholder analysis, will identify constructive (non zero-sum)
solutions. Gender issues have been specifically addressed during preparation: the creation of an animatrice post and an
additional budgeted category of women's activities, are ways of ensuring their full participation in rural development.

The project has been rated in the environmental screening category "B" and has been subject to a field-based environrmental
review. The environmental impact of the project is expected to be strongly positive. Collaboration between local
communities, local administrators and national experts has already focused on environmental activities. For example,
planting grasses on slopes and improving crop will reduce erosion on hillsides, thereby improving soil productivity and
sustainability.  Salinization will be tackled by developing adequate drainage in irrigated areas and integrating salt-tolerant
crops into the rotation cycle. Wind erosion will be reduced by encouraging plantations on sand dunes. In addition, natural
resources monitoring activities would help to improve conservation measures, e.g. irrigation water management, and the
effective control of residues from agricultural activities. A mitigation plan has been developed during project preparation
(see Annex 6 of the Project Implementation Report). In addition, specific criteria and methodology to select the works
which would be constructed to prevent soils erosion and recharge groundwater, have been established (see Section 3, of the
Project Implementation Report).

TUNISIA                                                                                  Natural Resources Mlanagement Project
*  The selection of the project areas was based on a study of natural resources management problems in Tunisia,
financed by a PHRD grant from the Japanese Governrnent. The study, which was launched in 1994 and completed in
1996, classified Tunisia's agricultural landscape into 3 zones, the North, the Center and the South, and within these
zones, 17 agro-ecological systems. Three agro-ecological systems were then selected among the most severely
degraded areas.
*  The eight-member Tunisian multidisciplinary identification team specified and prioritized 62 major constraints facing
natural resource management on which the project was designed. In June 1996, the Ministry of Agriculture organized
a three day seminar to present the central findings of the PHRD study, to enable wide stakeholder consultation, and to
strengthen Government ownership of the proposed Natural Resources Management Project. The seminar, which
included a workshop session on social issues and participation, brought to light numerous issues which were addressed
during preparation, including analysis of difficulties encountered in other participatory projects in the country.
•  The participatory approach, tested by ODESYPANO in the Northwest Mountainous Areas Development Project
(Loan 3691 -TUN), would be integrated at the CRDA level. The essence of the participation strategy would be the
implementation of PDP prepared by the Communities assisted by CRDA staff. Basic steps for the preparation of the
PDP are to: (a) identify stakeholders and marginal groups; (b) establish a dialogue with CRDA technical staff;
(c) elect a Development Committee (CD); (d) undertake needs and social assessments; (e) elaborate solutions and
prepare feasibility studies, including cost estimates; (f) sign an Annual Contract (CPA) between the CRDA and the
CD; and (g) implement the contract. The participatory approach should greatly enhance the sustainability of natural
resources management interventions in the project area, and could be expanded nationwide upon successful completion
of the project. In the past, such interventions sometimes failed to achieve objectives because community participation
and insight into the planning and prioritization process was absent. Natural resources are nevertheless an important,
but degrading, capital base for agricultural productivity and growth, and thus their sound management remains a top
priority. Benefits are expected to be both increased private (individual or collective) financial returns from activities
reliant on natural resources and social returns from reduction of negative off-site impacts such as siltation of
hydrological infrastructure. (See Annex 3 of the Project Implementation Report).

20. Sustainability
Project sustainability will depend on: (a) beneficiary ownership which will be obtained through their active participation in the
"project cycle"; (b) cost-effective, multidisciplinary support from the CRDAs and other regional agencies; and (c) technical
packages which offer private profitability. The implementation of a participatory approach through the CRDAs will address
fiscal sustainability. because management costs are expected to be lower than in the ODESYPANO model, as well as institutional
sustainability by supporting decentralization. Impact monitoring capacity and response mechanisms in the MOA, and capacity
building at community level, will also have to be strengthened.
In relation with the '>eplicability" of the project, it is estimated that the net cost of the project to the Tunisian Treasury
will amount to DT 20.6 million, which corresponds to the total cost of investments in the PDP (DT 27.9 million, less DT
6.3 million of farmers' contributions, less an estimated DT I million incremental tax revenues from production/marketing
chain), and represents a net cost of DT 4.1 million per annum. Extrapolating this cost to extend the project to other
severely degraded areas would require about DT 6.8 million per annum for treating an additional 500,000 hectares (30%
of the total 1.65 million hectares of affected areas) or DT 1 1.4 million for 800,000 hectares (50% of affected areas). In
order to achieve this, the Government could adopt more focused development programs or the beneficiaries could pay a
larger contribution to drinking water systems or to the most profitable project developments, notably, rehabilitation of
small-scale irrigation systems.

22. Possible Controversial Aspects:
Possible negative factors which could impede the success of the project include: (a) inadequate mobilization of the rural
communities, a risk which could be reduced through extensive training programs for the communities in general and for
individual farmers; (b) potentially limited markets for increased farm produce, a risk which could be reduced by providing
improved information to the producers; (d) the possibility that development costs under pilot actions would be high, thereby
prohibiting extension of the program nation-wide, a risk that would be mitigated by the direct participation of local
communities in executing and financing the Project; and (e) potential conflicts stemming from the selection of UST which
could challenge local power relations, a risk which could be reduced by ensuring early in-depth involvement of all local
stakeholders.

Strengthening the monitoring and evaluation capability
The Project will ensure that the project physical and financial operations are adequately monitored. In addition, as part of
the Institutional Strengthening Component, the Project will enhance the monitoring and evaluation capability at the CRDA
level.
Rationale for a Pilot Monitoring and Evaluation System
Considering the overall goal of the Project in Tunisia, it is essential to develop a locally based M&E system which will
assess the performance of the project including its economic and environmental impacts. This system will be based upon a
standardized framework to facilitate the collection, storage, validation, exchange and retrieval of information at UST, pilot
areas scales and beyond, and developed through a decentralized network to facilitate the dissemination of information within
each CRDA, and, in the future, between CRDAs and with the Central level. The M&E will consolidate current initiatives
to assess impact of natural resources management activities, such as the M&E system being developed by CES, through the
use of a standardized framework and the participation of all stakeholders to the assessment of economic and environmental
impacts.
Description of a Pilot Monitoring and Evaluation System
A pilot environmental information system will be developed, based on two sub-systems, the development of a database on
natural resources for the three pilot zones of the project and a set of interviews ("Panel"), in order to have statistical
information on the population in the three zones. The interviews will focus on interactions between agricultural policies and
natural resources management, in areas such as land tenure, rural credit, agricultural product prices, drought management
and decentralization.
Key Performance indicators
A set of 12 key performance indicators, chosen among the indicators which will be routinely collected during project
implementation, will be used to measure project result and impact. These indicators, included in a Supplemental letter to
the Loan Agreement, are as follows:
Improvement of natural resources management
*  Area of soil and water conservation treated lands to total eroded lands
*  Vegetation cover (Plantations)
* Number of spate irrigation and water recharge works completed
Improvement of the standard of living of the rural population
* Wheat yield per hectare
* Olive yield per hectare
*  Ratio of households with access to rural roads
*  Ratio of households with access to drinking water
Support to MOA decentralization
*  Implementation of management, monitoring and evaluation tools
*  Ratio of work completed by community participation (tacherons)
*  Number of Annual Contract completed
*  Ratio of community participation to soil and water conservation investment costs
*  Percentage of PDP investment costs directly targeted at women

Project Area
The selection of the project areas was based on a study of natural resources management problems in Tunisia, financed by a
PHRD grant from the Japanese Government. The study, which was launched in 1994 and completed in 1996, classified
Tunisia's agricultural landscape into three zones, the North, the Center and the South, and within these zones, 17 agro-
ecological systems. One project area was selected in each of the three zones, namely the Tell in the North of Tunisia, the
Dorsale occidentale in the Center, and the Jeffara in the South. Project interventions would not cover the whole agro-
ecological systems but would be concentrated in severely degraded zones within these areas. The agricultural systems, and
the project zones within them, were selected based on criteria such as the importance of natural resources degradation, the
administrative capacity present in the CRDAs, issues relating to land tenure and resource management as well as the level
of public investment in the area and the estimated potential of the project to thrive in the area. Some key characteristics of
these areas are given in the table below.

An eight-member Tunisian multidisciplinary identification team (including two social scientists, one male, one female) used
the Rapid Rural Appraisal Method to work closely with local communities at an early stage of project identification to
identify and prioritize 62 major constraints facing natural resource management.
The project zones include 340 USTs in nine delegations and a total population estimated at about 112,000. Agriculture
and livestock production are traditionally the main source of income for the rural population, though there is a large variety
of agricultural systems. The project areas are characterized by a rapid degradation of the natural resource base from over-
exploitation as a result of socio-economic pressures. The 62 problems identified by the PHRD study were classified in the
following seven groups: Water (7 problems), Soil (8), Forests (8), Crop production (14), Animal production (5), Socio-
economic infrastructure (5), Socio-economic environment (10). Generally the project areas are characterized by poor
infrastructures. The road network is of low density and poorly maintained. Few villages have electricity or piped potable
water and most people live far away from the nearest health care facility. Enrollment in primary education is low,
particularly for girls, often because house chores, including fetching water and collecting fuel wood, do not leave them
enough time to attend school on a regular basis.

The Tell A!ricultural System - Governorate of Jendouba
Mountainous Northern Tunisia receives adequate rainfall, thus making possible an array of diverse agricultural activities
such as growing fruits, vegetables, cereals, olives and raising a diversity of animals. In Northern Tunisia in general, and in
the Govemorate of Jendouba in particular, the main natural resource management problems are: (a) the degradation of
forests and common lands due to increasing population and demand for forest products such as firewood; (b) the
salinization of water through over-exploitation worsened by the absence of effective pricing mechanisms for irrigation;
(c) the erosion of hillsides through a system of land inheritance which subdivides land vertically down a hillside leading to
vertical plowing and thus a loss of top-soil.
The project would operate in two delegations of the Governorate of Jendouba, in an area covering about 40,000 ha just
south of the ODESYPANO project from which expertise was drawn to help design the participatory aspects of the NRMP.
Fruit and olive trees are grown on more than 4,600 ha, most of which is irrigated. Rainfed agriculture, much of which is
cereals, covers 15,500 ha. Animal husbandry is ubiquitous throughout the area, however, the vast majority of animals are
raised in small herds by virtually each family.
Dorsal Occidental AEricultural System - Governorate of Kasserine
Central Tunisia is widely agro-pastoral. In the Govemorate of Kasserine, much like the region, the problems faced by local
conumunities in tenus of natural resources management are: (a) expanding tree cultivation in the sandy steppes, (b) utilizing
grazing lands that provoke over-grazing, (c) increasing erosion, and (d) the over-exploitation of groundwater accompanied
by salinization problems.
The project would operate in three of the Govemorate's delegations in an area covering about 140,00 ha. Average monthly
temperatures range from 70 C in the winter to 260 C in the summer. Fruit trees cover about 15,000 ha, about half of which
are olive trees. Pistachios, almonds, apricots and apples have been introduced but their management is largely inefficient.
Cereals cover 22,000 ha of mostly wheat and barley. There are about 800 head of cattle, 42,600 sheep and 15,800 goats
which are raised on about 90,000 ha of rangelands.
Jeffara Agricultural System - Governorate of Medenine
Southern Tunisia is arid. Agriculture is dominated by pastoral systems and there are severe natural resource management
problems including: (a) the over-exploitation of water reserves caused by the expansion of oasis towns; (b) the
deterioration of irrigation systems which leads to salinization; and (c) intense land degradation, mainly in rangelands, which
can lead to desertification.
The project would operate in four delegations of the Governorate of Medenine, in an area covering about 116,000 ha. The
dry season lasts for 8 - 9 months followed by a period of three months with an average precipitation of 100 - 200 mm. In
the summer, average monthly temperatures can be as high as 300 C, and in the winter they can be as low as 60 C. The
project area is dominated by a plain which gently slopes down toward the City of Medenine and the coast. The sandy soil
supports only a typical steppe vegetation, largely alfa. Olive trees cover 33,000 ha of the project area. Cereal growing,
mainly barley (10,000 ha), and rearing livestock on about 65,000 ha of rangelands, are the other major agricultural
activities.

Detailed Project Description
Participatory Development Plans - US$38. 0 million
1.    The project would finance Participatory Development Plans (PDPs) prepared by local communities (USTs) to
address their priorities for key small-scale rural infrastructure investments. The design of the project, which gives a
proactive role to resource users in the decision making process, does not allow a detailed description of project components
to be financed in the area of natural resources management. However, Rapid Rural Appraisals carried out in a sample of
27 UST during preparation have identified priorities as perceived by local populations which are likely participants. The
project will finance in each of the three selected CRDAs the following sub-components:
2.     Soil and Water Conservation (CES). This sub-component will contribute to project objectives through
sustainable soil and water conservation activities carried out with the active participation of the populations concerned,
mainly on private lands. The measures under the project include : (a) gullies and ravines protection, both mechanically
2,025 ha of stone check dams and vegetatively with suitable local species 1,770 ha of vegetative protection of gullies and
525 ha of sylvo-pastoral rehabilitation; (b) arable land protection, by financing 1,200 ha of stone contour bunds, 1,250 ha
micro-catchment basins for fruit trees (on steeper slopes the project would promote measures including the planting of fruit
trees accompanied by small terraced water collectors), 700 ha of chisel plowing and stone contour bunds, and 1540 ha of
bunds; (c) water harvesting by constructing 13 hill-ponds, and 66 water recharge and 38 spate irrigation works; and (d) 20
km of dune stabilization fences. In addition, the project will help improve the management of forests on public land by
users and would organize communities to ensure the maintenance of infrastructures.
3.     Rehabilitation and Development of Small-Scale Irrigation Systems. This sub-component will contribute towards
project objectives by rehabilitating and increasing the efficiency of traditional small-scale irrigation systems. It will help
promote simple actions for improving water management rather than increasing the costs. Increased production will result
from the availability of more reliable water supply. A cropping intensilty of 1.0 and an increase from 40 to 65% of
irrigation efficiency will be realistic targets. The works under the project include 33 ha water point developments, 774 ha of
small reservoirs (30 m3), 85,000 m of wind breaks, and 170,000 m of buried pipe distribution system. Before starting the
works, water user associations (AICs) will be created to operate and maintain the systems.
4.     Agriculture and Rangeland Development. This sub-component will contribute towards achieving project objectives
both by aiming at improving the incomes of the populations and bv reinforcing project measures to improve natural
resources management, mainly reducing soil erosion and range degradation. The project, in the short term, would intensify
sustainable agricultural production based on existing technologies and promote integrated land management practices. In
the longer term, these techniques will be enhanced through a research and development program. Activities supported by
the project include: (a) fruit tree plantings, mainly olive (1.490 ha) and apple trees (170 ha), in both irrigated and rainfed
areas, (b) rangelands improvement by promoting existing technologies such as fodder tree plantations (386 ha), cactus
planting (2,700), soil harrowing associated with deferred grazing (1,150 ha) and reseedling (1,300 ha), and by establishing
two pilot perimeters, the first one in the collective land in the south (L'Ouara) and the second one in steppes of the center
(Tiouicha); (c) adaptive agricultural research and field demonstrations in the field of seeds, small-scale farm equipment and
contour plowing, to improve adoption rates by responding to the direct demand of farmers within the framework of PDPs.
This program will be developed on the basis of farmers' demands and in close collaboration between researchers and the
farmers, on about 120 plots. To support this component the project will provide equipment, tools, materials and farn
inputs for demonstrations and adaptive research.
5.     Rural Infrastructure. Among the top priorities of the communities are the construction of access roads and potable
water supply schemes within the framework of the PDPs. These infrastructures act as a motivating factor for the
communities to participate in more efficient natural resource management and anti-erosion measures which they might not
otherwise have been sensitive (e.g. closing of rangelands during deferred grazing periods). Based on estimates per UST, the
financing will cover mainly the rehabilitation of about 71 km of existing roads (65% of the total) compared to the
construction of new access roads (15 km of paved and 23 km of non paved roads). Financing will also be provided for

TUNISIA: Natural Resources Management Project                                                         Page 4 of 4
technical studies and work supervision. Regarding water supply schemes, the project will finance about five water point
developments, 45 shallow wells, 10 deep wells, and, where no groundwater resources are available, 59 collective water
tanks. Watering points for the livestock (119) will be included in each of these schemes.
6.      Women's Support Activities.  The primary mechanism for involving women in defining natural resource
management solutions will be the creation of women's groups by the 11 animatrices. These groups will define communal
activities to support women such as: micro-credit for individual enterprises and funds for collective projects like
encouraging rabbit farming, bee-keeping and nurseries. These will all be focused on increasing family livelihood through
food production for some consumption and sale, clothes making and rural crafts. Most activities will involve individual
women or small groups, but village/community activities will also be supported.
Sub-sectoral Investments - US$ 6.4 million
7.     The project will also protect agricultural and range zones implementing PDPs by supporting part of the
Government's routine soil and water conservation (CES) strategy through works to prevent soils erosion and recharge
groundwater. Three types of works will be financed under this component: 19 hill-ponds, 85 water recharge works and 40
spate irrigation works.
8.     The criteria and methodology used to select the works to be financed under the project have been finalized in
conjunction with the EU which is financing CES interventions in the same areas, are presented in the Project
Implementation Volume and are attached to a Supplemental letter to the Loan Agreement.
Institutional Strengthening - US$6.9 million
9.     Project Management. The project will have a central management team (Unite centrale de coordination - PIU)
based in DGFE in MOA which would be staffed with one Project Director and two technical staff (a planner responsible for
participatory programming and training, and a person in charge of the physical and financial monitoring of the project), two
support staff and on driver. The PIU will be provided with two liaison vehicles, computers with printers and software,
satellite or aerial images, photocopier, calculators and other office equipment and office furniture.
10.   Institutional Development at CRDA Level. The project will also have one regional team in each CRDA in the three
zones. Each team will be headed by one Regional Project Coordinator, assisted by a Participatory Programming Specialist.
The project will provide, in total 25 male and 11 female animators. The animators would be assisted by a multidisciplinary
team made up of at least 6 CRDA technical staff designated and made available according to project needs. Fields of
expertise in the team will include soil conservation, agronomy, rural engineering and pastoralism. In each CRDA 2 support
staff and 2 drivers would assist the Regional Project Coordinator. The project will also provide each CRDA with 6 liaison
vehicles, 16 4wd vehicles for field staff, computers, printers and software, photocopier, calculators, audio-visual and other
office equipment and office furniture. Animators will also be provided. including for monitoring and evaluation purposes,
with basic extension equipment.
11.    Training. Adequate training is the key to project success. Financing would therefore be provided for an important
training program for project staff and beneficiaries. A national team of 12 trainers would be created to implement the
project training program, and eventually to assist other participatory projects. The 36 animators would receive 10 weeks of
basic training and 20 days every year of follow-up training in participatory techniques and in technical subjects. Other
technical project staff would also receive about 30 days of training. This training would be completed with on-the-job
training using 28 months of local and 6 months of foreign consultants. Some training would also be given to representatives
of the USTs and technical visits would be organized to other regions of the country. Finally, training for CRDA technical
staff, about 4 days each, would be provided as well as study tours, about 19 staff-months.
12.    Technical Assistance. The project would finance international and local assistance, respectively 30 and 100 staff-
months, in the areas of project management, participatory approach, M&E, adaptive-research and pastoral developments.
Also, several thematic studies would be conducted during the project, such as the impact of land-tenure regime and price
policies on natural resources management, as well as the preparation of a Drought Management Strategy.

a/ The Opportunity Cost of Capital is estimated at 10.
Main Assumptions:
1. Present exchange rate is equivalent to economic cost of foreign exchange.
2. Costs are true economic costs except where otherwise noted in Farmod.
3. Credit is available to beneficiaries to finance their portion of project costs.
The project would have significant direct and indirect benefits. A comprehensive financial and economic analysis is
presented in Annex 6 of the Project Implementation Volume and summarized below.
In economic terms, the impact of the project actions are computed on the basis of incremental expenditures related to
quantifiable outputs, i.e. increased agricultural production, increased fodder production and increased availability of water
for both consumption and irrigation and also costs for activities for which benefits are not included because they are not
easily quantifiable. Estimates of incremental outputs include crops and fodder as well as benefits arising from soil
conservation and the efficiency of irrigation water. Indirect benefits such as off-site effects of reduced erosion, sand
protection, improved transportation and social benefits stemming from women's support activities have not been estimated,
although their value added would be considerable. Also, no estimate has been made of the long-term, nationwide benefits to
conservation of national natural resources that would accrue from investments under the project for institution-building. On
this basis, the overall project ERR is estimated at 13.7%. Sensitivity tests based on 10% reduction in output and a three-
year lag in implementation indicate that the ERR would decline to 12% and 9.4% respectively. Switching values at 13.7%
ERR indicate that to maintain a minimum 10% rate benefits would need to decline by 20.4% or costs increase by 25.6%.
These tests indicate that overall project viability would be sensitive to fairly modest declines in performance. However, as
the analyses include the total cost of social investments, especially rural roads and water supply - which costs would be
partially offset against other sectors - the results are robust enough to demonstrate a sound economic basis for the project.
Disaggregating project activities to the three areas (and excluding costs associated with the Project Implementation Unit)
produces the following ERRs: Jendouba 18%, Kasserine, 15%, and Medenine 9%. These results reflect the increasing
constraints as project actions move to more marginal areas. During appraisal, the ERR of the Medenine sub-project was
raised from 7% to 9% by reducing fixed organizational costs and quantifying some additional benefits from range
improvement activities and water points construction in l'Ouara pastoral areas. Further analysis, such as not including
costs for which benefits were not derived (ie. pastoral perimeter study, sand protection investments and spate irrigation
works) increases the Medenine ERR to 12.6%.

The overall production, in the project area would increase. Annual increments in agricultural production, based on average
rainfall, would amount to 9,000 tons for cereals, 3,200 tons for vegetables (mainly tomatoes) and 1,600 tons for apples
after 11 years. For tree crops, where a production peak is obtained after 20 years, the annual increment would be
approximately 3,000 tons.
In financial terms, analyses of the FARMOD budgets indicate that the proposed developments offer considerable benefits to
individual farmers and communities.
*  For crop and forage production on individual farms, the budgets indicate ratios of incremental benefits to costs ranging
from 1.4:1.0 (olive and apple grove intensification) to 5.0:1.0 (olive/barley and broad beans). On this basis, project
actions should be very attractive for farmers to invest labor and money. In addition, farmers are already familiar with
most of the products concerned. Furthermore, even if incremental yields were reduced by one third - with costs
remaining constant - the net benefit would continue to exceed 1.5:1.0 and should, therefore, remain attractive to
farmers.
* For other developments which would primarily involve natural resource conservation on a community level, the
marginal returns are even more buoyant, because the incremental benefits continue to be high while the annual costs for
maintenance are minimal.
Accepting that the potential returns from crop and forage production would be attractive to individual farmers, there are
questions regarding the transfer of information and the means for financing the proposed developments. The provisions
under the project for assigning animators should provide an ideal conduit for addressing the fundarnental need for
infornation on alternative approaches to development. For financing procedures, the problem is more complex because the
project area includes farmers that are among the poorest in the country and, therefore, have few reserves. At the same time,
a basic objective of the project is to explore innovative approaches for sustainable rural development that could
subsequently be extended to similar areas in other parts of the country.  It is important, therefore, to adopt a realistic
approach for ensuring adequate financing while minimnizing net outlays from the fiscal budget.
In addition, the FRR was calculated for four regional UST models, based on the aggregation of the various FARMOD
models and which, therefore, do not include water conservation works, i.e. hill-ponds, water recharge and spate irrigation
works. The following table confirms the results obtained at the regional level: FRR range from 20% in the arid south to
43% in the sub-humid north, responding mainly to the profitability of commercial crops and to the importance of costs of
erosion control programs. For instance, Medenine UST, located on the plateau, has the lowest IRR due to the extent of
soils and water protection work, while the IRR is higher in Jendouba where productive investments are more important, in
particular for horticulture production.

Incremental investments and recurrent expenditures resulting from the project activities after completion of implementation
would average US$2 million per annum. This includes: (a) for recurrent costs, maintenance of the M&E system and
equipment, operation and maintenance for vehicles, office operating costs, and salaries, including travel allowances.
Annual costs for the maintenance of civil works would amount to US$3 10,000. It was estimated that maintenance for rural
roads and CES works would be half financed by the Government budget and half by the beneficiaries, while for potable
water, AIC would be responsible for 100 percent of operations and maintenance; (b) for investment costs, refresher training
for project staff as well as training activities and field visits for community members. In addition, funds would have to be
made available starting in Year 2003 to replace vehicles and in Year 2005 to replace equipment, which represent
approximately 45% of the unit cost of small-scale irrigation systems rehabilitation and 55% of the unit cost of drinking water
systems.
Cost sharing estimates between the public sector and beneficiaries will vary according to the type of investments and the
profitability/pay-back period of the activities. The following assumptions have been based on the provisions of the Tunisian
Investment Code.

Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements
Procurement
Procurement methods (Table A)
Bank-financed civil works, goods and services will be procured using the latest Bank procedures. The procurement
methods, that correspond to the expenditure categories, which will be used are detailed in Table A below.
*     ICB for contracts with an estimated value greater than US$ 350,000 for goods. All goods procured under ICB will
use the Bank standard bidding documents;
*     NCB for work contracts with an estimated value of more than US$20,000; and for goods estimated to cost between
US$ 100,000 to US$ 350,000;
*     Intemational shopping for goods estimated to cost between US$50,000 and US$100,000;
*     National shopping for contracts with an estimated value of less than US$50,000 for goods;
*     Community participation in procurement for work contracts with an estimated value of less than US$20,000 will be
encouraged in accordance with procedures acceptable to the Bank. A document describing the procedures for
community participation in the provision of works has been submitted and approved by the Bank.
*     Consultants will be selected in accordance with Bank's Guidelines on the Selection of Consultants, January 1997
Prior review thresholds (Table B)
For the first two contracts of each CRDA for works and goods awarded under NCB, as well as for all works
contracts above US$500,000 and all goods contracts above US$350,000. For consultants contracts equal to or exceeding
US$100,00 for firms and US$50,000 for individuals, and for all Terms of reference irrespective of the amounts.
Disbursement
Allocation of loan proceeds (Table C)
Use of statements of expenses (SOEs):
*     All works and goods contracts of less than US$500,000 and US$350,000 equivalent, respectively
*     Consultant contracts of less than US$100,000 for firms and US$50,000 for individuals
Special account: The initial authorized allocation would be limited to FRF5 million. The maximum authorized
allocation would reach FRFI0 million when disbursements reach FRF50 million.
Cofinancing. The Government has indicated that the European Union would provide US$1.7 million equivalent,
under its Integrated Rural development and Natural Resources Management Program, to finance part of the training
and technical assistance component.
