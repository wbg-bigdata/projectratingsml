MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
W0 THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF GHANA
FY)R 1H LOCAL GOVERNMBT DESELOP-MEN PRO.lECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following report and recoramendP;ion on a proposed credit to
the Republic of Ghana for SDR 27.7 million, the equivalent of US$ 38.5 million, on standard terms
with a matrity of 40 year-e, to help finance the Local Government Development Project (LGDP).
Co-financing of US$8.3 million equivalent is to be provided by the Government of Germany through
KW.
2.    Iound: The World Bank has provided support for urban development in Ghana
through several operations since 1985. Bank assistance has focused on the rehabilitation of urban
infrastrucure and services (roads, water supply, sewerage and sanitation, drainage, solid waste,
markets, public transport, traffic management, and area upgrading) and on institutional strengthening
at the central and municipal levels, especially in cost recovery and revenue mobilization. Ihe first
Bank-assisted urban project was the Accra District Rehabilitation Project (completed), which covered
Accra only. The Priority Works Project (completed), the Urban II Project (under implementaon),
and the Urban Transport Project (approved by the Board in May 1993) have extended investments and
institutional strengthening to the five main cities of Ghana (Accra, Kumasi, Tamale, Tema, and
Sekondi-Takoradi). Urban water supply is being addressed through the current Water Sector
Reabilitation Project, which covers Kumasi, Sekondi-Takoradi, and Tamale, plus 35 smaler towns.
3.    The Local Government Law (PNDCL 207, 1988) and the new Constitution (1992) gave
authority for the establishment of 45 new districts (local governments), bringing the total to 110. The
laws also granted broad new powers to Districts and increased their responsibilities. Among other
things, the new laws provide for the extensive decentralization of many centralized governental
fnctions to the District level and establish the District as the basic level of planning, economic
management, administration, and political decision-making. Elections were held for t! newly
established District Assemblies (DAs) in 1988 and 1989, and the new local government system has
now been established. Current debate centers on the role and functions of these Assemblies in an on-
going democratzation process, on equipping them to discharge their new responsibilities, and on
improving essental infrastructure and services. Local government affairs fall under the responsibility
of the Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development (MLGRD).
4.    The Bank's urban sector strategy, based on a review done in 1988, affirms the importance of
supporting urban development because of the important and growing contribution made by urban
centers to national productivity. The strategy comprises support for decentralized and effective urban
management, more efficient urban financial management and resource mobilization, reform of land
registration, improvement of physical planning and control, and rehabilitation and extension of
infrastructure. Among the results of the ADRP project are a three-fold increase in Accraes revenues
since 1985; computerization of the city's accounting systems; institutional improvements in
infrastructure maintenance; and development of a city corporate plan. Similar trends are evident in
the Urban II cities.
5.    The Bank undertook a Local Government Sector Study in 1992 to determine ways of assisting
Ghana witi its decentraization program. The main conclusion of this study was that, given the broad



scope of the decentralization provisions, the government needs help in implementing decentralization
over a m-alti-year period, with a few key fuz4tions selected as priorities for immediate attention. The
Bank study identifies one of the priorities as local public finance, especially the furiher improvement
of local revenue mobilization and reform of the system for central-local revenue transfers. The
second priority identified in the study is the improvement of local government mangement, including
budgeting, personnel, and recurrent operation and maintenance of serv.ces.
6.    The GOG and the Bank agree on the importance of urban development for economic growth
in Ghana. While some progress has been made in the past decade to relieve seine of the most critical
deficiencies in urban services in the maini cities, major physical deficits and capacity constraint
remain to be addressed. For Ghana to meet its objective of accelerated growth, its cities and towns
must be able to provide substantially higher levels of infrastructure and services, must be managed
more efficiently, and must offer a more supportive enviromnent for private investment. In this
context, secondary cities are key centers of economic activty, administration, technology
transmission, trading, and entrepreneurship. They also serve as marketing and service centers in
support of the rural economy.
7.      0W     OWjtve: The proposed project, covering 11 important secondary cities, responds
to the government's interest in extending urban infrastructure investment and institutional
strengthening efforts to the next "tier' of the urban hierarchy and furthering its new decentralization
program. The specific objectives of the LGDP are (a) to improve basic infrastructure and urban
services in secondary cities, especially services benefitting lower-income people, (b) to promote the
sustainability and expansion of urban services by strengthening the District Assemblies' financial,
technical, and managerial capacities, and (c) to support decentralization in order to promote
accountability and efficiency in the provision of urban services. The improvement of the central
governments ability to provide technical and financial assistance in support of the decealization
effort is also an important objective.
8.     fWect DescriDi: The project would cover 11 secondary cities which play important roles
in the economy as regional market centers, regional and district administrative centers, and service
provision centers. ITe project would have two main components: (a) rehabilitation and urading of
nft=cture and services and (b) Institutional strengthening. The infrastructure and services
component is based on priorities identified by the 11 District Assemblies. It covers three categories:
road improvements, comprising rehabilitation of key town center roads and links with the trunk road
network, associated roadside drainage, and traffic management measures (US$15.5 m. base cost);
waste management, comprising establishment of environmentally safe solid and liquid waste disposal
sites, provision of solid waste collection equipment, and improvement of public and household
sanitation facilities (US$12.5 m. base cost); and rehabilitation and upgrading of public markets and
motor parks (US$6.6 m. base cost,. In addition, the IDA credit will provide seed money (US$1.3 m.
from the credit) to the DAs for the establishment of Operation and Maintenance Funds.
9.    The instittional strengthening component (US$7.74 m. base cost) has two main parts. The
first is capacity-building of District Assemblies, comprising technical assistance and taiing for
municipal engineerinw, including operation and maintenance of facilities and supervision of civfl
work; local government financial management, ceteing upon the implemaion by the DAs of
Revenue Improvement Action Plans (RIAPs), covering greater revenue mobilization, including cost
recovery of facilities and services financed by the project, and improved budgeting and accounting;
and District planning and implementation, focusing on improved personnel and annual work plan
management. The other part of institutional strengthening is enhancing the capacity of selected



-3 -
central government agencies to support local government. TA and training will be provided to
MLGlD, die Land Valuation Board (LVB) for revaluation of properties in the 11 towns, the Survey
Department (SD) for mapping, the Town and Country Planning Department (TCPD) to work with the
DAs on improved land use plans and development guidance, and the Technical Services Center (rSC)
of MWH for implementation support on behalf of MLGRD and the DAs. In the policy area, the
project will support (a) a governmental review of the local revenue mobilization and transfer system,
which will generate proposals to foster greater DA autonomy and more predictability and focus In
transfers, and (b) a pilot scheme for the use of personal services contracts by the DAs to staff three
key higher-level positions, as a way of introducing a more market-oriented approach in local
government employment.
10.   The project cost including contingencies, duties and taxes is estimated at US$55.5 million
equivalent of which US$29.5 million is in foreign currency. IDA woald finance US$38.5 willion,
which amounts to about 69 percent of the project cost excluding duties and taxes. The Government
of Ghana will provide US$5.55 million, tue District Assemblis US$3.16 million, and the
Governnment of Germany through KfW US$8.3 million. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan
are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursement scnedule are
shi'wn in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of B&nk Group
operations are given in Schedules C and ID, respectively. A map is also attached. The Staff
Appraisal Report No. 12332-GH dated January 18, 1994 is being distributed separately.
11.   foect Implemetion:  MLGRD will provide overall policy guidance for the project.
TSC will have primary responsibility for project implementation. TSC has extensive experience in
managig two previous (ADRP and PWP) and one ongoing (Urban UI) Bank-assisted urban
development projects. TSC will be responsible for operational coordination, day-to-day management,
accounting, procurement, contract administration, and reporting. TSC possesses adequate skll and
absorptive capacity for the LGDP. Technical support for and supervision of the institutional
strengthening component of the project will be provided by MLGRD's Local Government Support
Unit (LGSU) and Training Support Unit (TSU), both of which are being strengthened through the
current Urban UI Project. As mentioned above, LVB, SD, and TCPD will support the DAs in
carying out mapping, land revaluation, and physical planning. The Regional and District offices of
these agencies are to report to the District Assemblies under the new decentralization scheme. DAs
will sign contracts for local works, will assist TSC with the supervision of implementation, and will
have responsibility for operation and maintenance. O&M tasks (e.g. operation of the waste disposal
sites; cleaning of markets; maintenance of vehicles and equipment) will be contracted to the private
sector except for very minor activities. The activities in each city will be coordinated by a District
Steering Committee composed of the heads of the key operating divisions of the District under the
chairmnship of the District Secretary. At the national level, the project will be supervised by a
Project Coordinating Committee (PCC) under the chairmanship of MLGRD and comprising the heads
of the participating agencies.
12.   Project Sustainability: The infrastructure and services investments will be sustained through
(a) the establishment of adequately funded operation and maintenance accounts by each District, (b)
technical assistance to Districts in organizing O&M, with an emphasis on contracting out as many of
the services as possible, and (c) establishment of improved rate setting and fee collection for cost
recovery from markets, motor parks, and solid waste services. Commitment on the part of the
District Assemblies to sustining the improved services has been fostered through the active
participation of local officials in project formulation. In the longer term, the susniability of urban
services would also be strengthenAd ihrough the project's support for improved local revenue



-4-
mobilization and financial management. Ihe project Is structured in an institutionally su;tainable
way, In that TSC, the primary execudng agency, is a permanent governmental entity which is staffed
by civil serv', as and wbich has developed as the government's prime center of capacity for urban
implemen tau&.
13.   Leos from Previm Ex,"rim  The most important lessons from the previous projects
concern the need to give detailed attention to procurement planning and implementation, to ensure that
institutional support components are given adequate early attention, and to put in place sustainable
operation and maintenance systems. The arrangements outlined in the Proiect Description and Project
Implementation sections above address these points. The reliance on institutions with substantial
previous exprience in Bank-assisted projects will help ensure that project implementation proceeds on
schedule. Ihe 11 DistrIct Assemblies have participated extensively in project preparation and
appraisal, giving them a good understanding of %heir role and a stake in the success of the project. In
particular, an effort has been made to discuss with the DAs and obtain their commiment to their
future obligatons regarding operation and maintenance. In addition, earlier project experience shows
that capacity building cannot succeed unless the utilization and development of national human
tesources is maimized and the reliance on expatriates is minimized. In LGDP, tecbnical assistance
will be almost exclusively through national consultants; foreign consuliants wfll be short-term only
and will be limited to periodic supervision (for KfW) and specialists for th! mapping component.
14.   Rationale for IDA Involernent: The proposed project is a logical next step for Bank
support for the urban sector in Ghana. IDA remains the largest external donor for urban development
in the country. Ihrough its involvement since 1985 in several major urban projects and sector
studies, the Bank has established an ongoing partnership with the GOG based on an agreed strategy
for improving urban infrastructure and management. This relationship has already produced
considerable progress on the alleviation of infrastructure deficits and irmprovements in the policy
environment and institutional capacity. The government looks to the Bank for continued guidance and
support In urban development. In this project, IDA's involvement is crucial in promoting the
substantive participation of local governments in project implementation, the establishmet of
adequate O&M funding arrangements, the extension of local revenue mobilization and financial
management improvements, and the introduction of management practices involving the private sector
(e.g. personal services contracts and contracting out O&M). The project supports several of the key
elements of the Bank's country assistance strategy discussed by the Executive Directors on June 10,
1993; i.e. capacity-building (including devolution of responsibilities to local government and
improved financial revenue mobilization), improvement and extension of basic services, and
promoting the involvement of the private sector in the provision and maintenance of urban services.
15.   AZMe  Actio: At ppraisal, the following issues were resolved: (a) a Memorandum of
Understanding was signed between MLGRD and MWH defining the role of TSC in the project (b)
preliminary environmental assessments of the waste disposal sites were completed, and the suitability
of the sites was verified; (c) principles and procedures were established governing operation and
maintenance of each of the types of facilities and services to be financed; (d) the detailed structre
and terms of reference of technical assistance were established; and (e) agreement was reached with
MLGRD on introducing through the project the use of personal services contracts for higher level
staffing at the DA level and on carrying out a policy review of local revenue mobilization.
16.   At negotiations, Govenmment and IDA agreed on: (a) the contents of a Letter of Local
Goverment Development Policy from MLGRD; (b) conducting annual joint (GOG-DAs-IlDA) project
implementation reviews; (c) carrying out a mid-term review of the project; (d) the timely



-  -
disbutsement of counterpart funds on a quarterly basis; and (e) the contents a Project Implementation
Mnual. At negotiations Government also provided to the Association the names of the Project
Coordinators of the participating District Assemblies.
17.   The final signed Letter of Local Government Development Policy has been submitted by the
Government to IDA. The conditions of credit effectiveness will be: (a) completion, with full
participation of and formal ratification by the respective District Assemblies, of Revenue
Improvement Action Plans satisfactory to IDA for all 11 cities; (b) deposit by the Government of the
initial instlment of counterpart funds into the project account; (c) opening of sub-project accounts in
each of the 11 LrGDP towns and deposit of the initial installments; (d) finalization of detailed
engineering and the production of bid documents for all civil works; (e) acquisition of land for solid
and liquid waste disposal sites by at least six District Assemblies; and (f) preparation of the first
annual training plan for all the DAs in a form acceptable to IDA. Submission to IDA of satisfactory
evidence of the acquisition of land for solid and liquid waste disposal sites is a condition of IDA's
disbursement for these subcomponents.
18.   Envrownental Asgecs: lTe project has been given a *B" environmental caegory. It
would have significant positive environmental effects, through the increased coverage of sanitation
facilies (both public and private), better maintenance of the public toilets, the creation of safe
disposal sites for liquid waste, more effective collection of solid waste, the establishment of properly
operated landfil sites for solid waste, and the upgrading of markets and motor parks through paving,
alleviation of congestion, and basic water and sanitation. The waste disposal sites have been
evaluated and are suitable. The necessary features to minimize the risk of ground or surface water
contamination will be included in the final designs of the waste disposal facilities and the sanitation
facilities. The project does not involve any demolition of dwellings or relocation of households.
19.   fm       QbWective Categoies: Although all the investments of LGDP will provide
immediate benefits to the lower-income populations of the 11 towns, the waste management and
mor park subprojects will have the greatest direct impact on this group. Lower-income people will
be the principal users of the public toilets to be rehabilitated and constructed under the project. This
group is also the main user of public transportation, which will improve as a result of the motor park
upgrading and road rehabilitation. In the long term, the lower-income groups will benefit from better
services that would result from improved urban management in the cities and from enhanced
opportunities arising from urban economic development.
20.   f!Ws Benefits h Te project would support national economic development by improving
infrastructure and services in economically important secondary cities. Ihe project would also
improve living conditions for the over one-half million residents of the project cities by providing
bettom roads, drainage, sanitation, garbage collection and disposal, public markets, and motor parks.
Approximately 10% of the population benefitted by the project would be below the national poverty
theshold. The project's support for greater revenue mobilization and more efficient management by
local government would promote the sustnability of urban services and, in the longer term future,
the expansion of coverage. Economic rates of return were calculated for a sample of subprojects
comprising 27 percent of the total value of physical investments. ERRs for the road and drainage
rehabilitation tomponents are uniformly high, averaging 90%, due to projected high growth in vehicle
volumes and relatively modest costs of rehabilitation. Ihe average ERR for the upgrading of markets
and motor parks is 18%; for the solid waste components it is 16%; and for the liquid waste
components it is 35%. All ERRs remained acceptable under sensitivity analysis.



-6 -
21.   RL3skl  Ihe risks related to limited implementation capacity in MLGRI) and the DAs will be
mitigated by the participation of TSC as the main implementing agency. The potential problem of
coutepart funds availability would be addressed by making the initial deposit of the gover:ment's
contrbution a condition of credit effectiveness. The risk that operation and maintenance of facilities
would not be sustained will be handled through the establishment by each District of a special O&M
account, to which IDA would provide seed money. The risk that local government revenue
mobilization would not be implemented effectively is addressed by requiring that the RIAPs be
prepared with the fill involvement of DAs and be formally ratified by them. Project implementation
will be facilitated by the advance preparation of designs and tender documents before credit
effeciveness and the pres-nce in the World Bank Resident Mission of two higher-level staff (one HQ,
one local) who would monitor and supervise the project.
22.   1IOMMUdffon: I am satisfied that the proposed credit woild comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Association and recommeid that the Executive Directors approve it.
