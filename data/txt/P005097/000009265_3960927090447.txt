MEMORANDUM ANI) REICOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMIENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE EGYPTIAN ELECTRICITY AUTHORITY
WITH A GUARANTEE FRONI THE ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT
FOR A FOURTH POWER PROJECT
1.       I submit the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Egyptian Electricity Authority, for US$165.0 million for
approval. The proposed loan would ue for 20 years, including a five-year
grace period, at the standard variable interest rate linked to the borrowing
costs of the Bank,-and would help finance a Fourth Power Project. The project
would be cofinanced by ADB, Arab Fund, EIB and IDB for US$319.0 million.
2.       Baekoround.  Electric power is a core development priority.
Electricity consumption in Egypt has grown more than 102 per year between
1975-85 mainly due to high GDP growth rates, low electricity tariffs,
increasing electrification and the introduction of energy intensive industrial
processing. Despite low GDP growth rates since 1986, electricity consumption
has continued to grow at 10 per year between 1986-88. Between 1980-88,
installed generating capacity grew at about 81 p.a., while peak demand grew at
about 10% per year. The narrowing gap between capacity additiuns and demand
growth has resulted in lowering of the reserve margin to less than 102. The
main development task in the power sector is to slow the rapid rate of growth
of power demand, provide adequate additional generation capacity to meet a
moderate demand growth, and implement a least-cost investment program with
emphasis on substitution of economically more efficient fuel such as use of
domestic natural gas in power stations. The GOE is aware of these issues and
has shown its willingness to address them by formulating a strategy for sector
development as part of the medium-term economic reform program initiated in
1987. The strategy includes three main policy objectives: (i) to adjust
energy and electricity prices to reach the economic levels by June 1995; (ii)
to provide economic and diversified domestic energy supplies and increase the
quantity of oil exported by developing natural gas supplies; and (iii) to
encourage efficient energy use through demand management, conservation and
pricing measures.
3.       The GOE has already initiated several steps to achieve these
objectives. In May 1987, it increased prices of petroleum products and
natural gas by an average of 661 and electricity tariffs by an average of
291. Subsequent to 1987 action, in 1988, gasoline prices were increased by
451.  Again with effect from March 24, 1989, the GOE increased prices of gas
oil by 441, kerosene by 45% and fuel oil and natural gas by 251 and
electricity tariffs by 311. Overall, since 1985-86 the weighted average
energy prices in nominal terms increased by 217% for petroleum products and
natural gas, and by 1801 for electricity. The CPI increased by 1151 during
the same period. As a result of implementinig these measures, the weighted
average price of petroleum etd natural gas as a percentage of world prices
increased from 15% in 1985-86 to 361 in 1988-89; electricity tariffs at
present average about 241 of the long-run marginal cost (LRMC). In addition,
the Government has (i) rationalized the sector investment program under the
second plan (1987-92); (ii) encouraged and attracted international oil
companiies to explore and develop natural gas; (iii) initiated work on



comprehensive electricity planning, energy conservation and offLeLency
improvements of power system through load management programs, power system
controls, reduction of power losses and improvement of power system plannting
and demand forecasting; and (iv) improved operatlonal efficiency by converting
from open cycle to combined cycle operations. All these measures are steps in
the right direction to improve efficiency in energy utilIzatLon. The proposed
project would support these Initiatives In the power subsector.
4.       Froject Oblectives. The project would assist E&A tot (1) alleviate
power shortages thereby meeting the growing demand for electricity; (ii)
transfer technology, particularly in high efficiency combined eycle power
plant construction and operation; (iii) strengthen the institution to focus on
an improved accounting and management information system and load management,
through comprehensive training and technical assistance programs; and (iv)
support the implementation of a program to protect and improve the environment.
5.       Project Descrition.
The proposed project would consist of the following components:
(a) construction of a combined cycle power plant with a total
capacity of about 1,080 MW at Faraskur (Damietta) in the Delta
Region and a housing colony nearby for plant staff;
(b) provision of 138 MW of net additional generating capacity by
converting the existing industrial type combustion turbines at
the Mahmoudia and Damanhour power stations to combined cycle;
(c) construction of 380 km of 220-kV transmission lines .ad 500 MVA
of transformer capacity in the substations to efficiently
transmit the power generated in power plants to the load
centers; and
(d) provision of technical assistance to the Borrower for: (i) the
engineering consulting services for (a), (b) and (c) above;
(ii) load research and load management techniques; (iii) the
installation of the tower testing facilities for transmission
lines; (iv) the installation of the energy electricity data bank
and management information system; and (v) environmental
activities.
A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A; amounts
and methods of procurement, disbursements and the disbursement schedule are
shown in Schedule B. The project would involve substantial amounts of
cofinancing (in the amount of US$319.0 million) from ADB, the AF, EIB and the
IDB. GOE/EEA have already concluded loan agreements with ADB, the AF, and the
IDB. Agreement for the EIB loan is expected to be concluded in June, 1989. A
timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in Egypt are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A Staff
Appraisal Report No. 6641-EGT, dated May 26, 1989, is also attachee.
6.       Rationale for DBRD Involvement.  The Bank's participation would allow
a continuing dialogue with the Government and EEA on a wide variety of
00 17 M



sector issues including energy pricing, investment and institutional reforms.
The Bank's presence would facilitate resource mobilization from bilateral and
multilateral sources for power subsector development through effective aid
coordination.
7.       Aetim           The main actions agreed with GOE/EEA are:
(a)    (i)    domestic prices of petroleum products, natural gas and
electricity, would be adjusted to economic levels by June 30,
1995 in annual consultation with the Bank;
(ii)    load management measures would be implemented on all extra high,
high and medium voltage users including implementation of peak
load pricing policies;
(iii)    generation by EEA from internal operations of funds to meet its
debt service obligations and to cover an adequate proportion of
its investiaent expenditures, and maintenance of accounts
receivables at reasonable levels;
(iv)    an annual review of EEA's financial position to determine EEA's
ability to meet objectives in (iii) and necessary measures to be
submitted to the Bank and Government for their consideration; and
(v)    a meteorological tower and air quality monitoring station would
be established by 1991, an environmental laboratory by 1992, and
a thermal plant model of the cooling water discharge system at
the power station would be constructed under the project by 1991.
(b)      Signing of EIB loan for the project would be a condition of
effectiveness of this loan.
8.       Justification. The project forms part of EEA's least cost investment
program required to alleviate power shortages and meet the projected demand
requirements. The project is in line with a Government objective to diversify
the types of fuel used such as gas, by substituting petroleum products for
power generation. The project fully meets the objective of improving power
system efficiency by constructing and operating a high efficiency combined
cycle power plant and by converting open cycle power plants to combined cycle
plants. The rate of return calculated on the required power investment
program for the incremental demand met by the project is 10% percent. In the
analysis, the tariffs accounting for a major proportion of benefits are based
on domestic prices; while the costs associated with the project are based on
international prices. Since the domestic prices are set below economic costs
by the Government, the low rate of return is not a true measure of the
economic worth of the project; the value of the benefits attributed to the
project is depressed, relative to economic costs. If tariffs are set to
reflect the full economic cost of electricity supply, the rate of return would
increase to 17X. The economic benefits of the project not included in the
benefit stream are considerable. These include savings to the econxomy

through efficiency gains; progressive correction of distortions in the
electricity taritf structure; future gains through improved planning and
operational efficiency; and concomitant benefits through linkage effects of
the project which forms an integral component of the sectoral development and
economic reform program.
9.       Risks. No risk that could be a potential problem for the physical
construction of the project is anticipated. Foreseeable construction risks
have been taken into consideration in the design of the project and in the
cost estimates. However, there are risks related to possible delays in
implementation. To reduce the impact of implementation delays, the project
cost estimates, including price contingencies, are spread over seven years
even though a project of this nature could be completed in less than five
years. Further risks due to delays in the implementation of expected and
agreed electricity tariff adjustments would have an adverse impact on the rate
of return on investment. Sufficient assurances have been obtained from the
government regarding the implementation of these electricity tariff
adjustments.
10.      Eeomendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan complies
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve this loan.
