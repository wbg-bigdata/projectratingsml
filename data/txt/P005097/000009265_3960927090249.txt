FOURTH POWER PROJECT
I. THE ENERGY SECTOR
Introduction
1.01     Egypt is a net oil exporter and its energy sector, in particular, its
petroleum subsector, plays a key role in Egypt's development. Even with
declining oil prices since 1985-86, the petroleum seccor at present accounts
for 5.4h of total GDP, 37% of total merchandise exports and continues to be a
major source of external earnings. Despite the Government of Egypt's (GOE)
energy policy goal to maintain the current level of oil production at 44 MTOE
per year in the current plan period to 1991-92, GOE faces a number of serious
problems in the energy sector that are causing severe strains on the economy
and threatening Egypt's prospects for economic development. Some of these
problems such as low world oil prices are outside Egypt's control, while
others, such as rapid growth in energy demand and inefficiencies in energy use
result from low level of domestic energy prices. Since world oil prices are a
moving target, domestic energy prices as percenta-e of world market prices
continue to vary with changes in international oil prices. With world oil
prices averaging around $18 per barrel at present, the weighted average of
domestic petroleum product prices in Egypt is about 36%. Electricity tariffs
average about 24% of the long-run marginal cost (LRMC). Low energy prices
have encouraged rapid growth in demand and wasteful use of energy; promoted
questionable industrial investments because artificially low energy prices
conceal the true economic costs of investments; placed a severe strain on
Governmenit finances, and finally, diverted potential petroleum exports to the
domestic market with adverse impact on the balance of payments and the
economy. There is, therefore, an urgent need to address the major issues
facing the sector and develop a coherent energy sector strategy. The energy
sector issues include: energy pricing, demand management and conservation,
investment strategy and resource development, in particular gas development,
institutional reforms and operational efficiency.
1.02     Over the last five years, energy policy dialogue between the Bank and
the GOE have focussed on the issues outlined above (Para 1.01) and emphasized
the need for the adoption by the Government of a comprehensive long-term
energy policy, including a program to adjust domestic prices to economic
levels. In 1987, the Bank and the Government mutually agreed to the 0-OE's
objective of raising energy prices to economic levels latest by the end of
fiscal year 1994-95, as part of a medium term economic reform program. As a
OS6 9M

first step, the GOE increased petroleum product prices by an average of 66%
and electricity tariffs by 29% with effect from May 1, 1987. Subsequent to
the May 1987 comprehensive increases, gasoline prices were increased by about
40% in May 1988. Again with effect from March 24, 1989, GOE increased gas oil
prices by 44b, kerosene prices by 40b, fuel oil and natural gas prices by 252
and raised electricity tariffs by an average of 31b. In addition, in May 1989
the GOE has reaffirmed its official medium-term energy sector strategy which
includes three major objectives:
(a) to adjust energy prices to reach the level of international prices by
June 30. 1995;
(b) to encourage efficient use of energy through demand management and
energy conservation measures; and
(c) to provide economic and diversified domestic energy supplies and
increase exportable oil surpluses by implementing an effective
natural gas development strategy.
Resource Base and Development Prospects
1.03     Egypt's main energy resources include oil, natural gas, coal and
hydropower. As of January 1989, proved oil reserves were 480 million tons.
Proved xiatural gas reserves were 250 million ton oil equivalent (MTOE).
Reserves of coal are limited and the only mining project now being considered
at the Maghara Mine in Sinai, would produce 600,000 tons per year (0.4 MTOE)
by 1995. Most of the hydropower potential of the Nile Rivtr is already being
exploited and in normal hydrological years produces about 10,500 GWh
(equivalent to 2.6 MTOE of primary energy if fuel had to be used to produce
the same electricity).
1.04     Egypt has been successful in attracting foreign oil companies to
explore, develop and produce oil. Presently, there are some 134 agreements
with 50 international companies functioning as operators with the State Oil
Company, Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC). Successful oil
development has enabled Egypt to supply domestic requirements and export about
12 MTOE in 1987-88. However, 1987-88 production of 44.0 million tons is at
the plateau rate which Egypt at best, could try to maintain until 1995.
1.05     Natural gas production in 1987-88 was 5.2 MTOE.  There are a number
of discovered non-associated gas fields which would require about $800 million
to be developed over the next five years. The Government's policy accords
priority for gas exploration and development. EGPC has successfully amended
terms for gas exploration with international companies. Following these
amendments in December 1986, EGPC has signed 30 agreements for oil and gas
exploration with ten international oil companies. The assured market and
pricing of newly discovered natural gas linked to international fuel oil
prices should provide adequate incentives for other international companies in
gas exploration activities.
EnerKy Sector Institutions
1.06     Egypt's energy sector is the responsibility of the Ministry of
05 6 9 Ii



- 3 -
Petroleum and Mineral Resources (MOP) and the Ministry of Electric Power and
(Nuclear) Energy (MEE).  In addition, in 1983 the Organization for Energy
Planning (OEP) was established in order to create an energy data base, prepare
forecasts, develop a national energy plan, coordinate the energy research
program in the country, and promote energy conservation by carrying out energy
audits, pri.7iding technical advice, organizing training programs and carrying
out publicity campaigns. At piresent, OEP is mainly engaged in promoting
energy conservation by carrying out energy audits.The OEP is an autonomous
institution under the Supreme Energy Council (SEC), which consists of all
Cabinet Miaisters concerned with energy.
1.07     The Government-owned Egyptian General Petroleum Corporat on (EGPC)
functions as a holding company under the control of MOP. EGPC is responsible
ior managing all exploration, production, refining, transportation,
distribution and marketing of oil and gas in Egypt through 14 affiliates.
Four of these affiliates are partnerships in oil production with foreign
companies, seven (totally owned by EGPC) are involved in refining, transport,
marketing and distribution of oil and gas, and the remaining three are joint
ventures in engineering, construction and drilling.
1.08     MEE oversees the power subsector through the following five
authorities: (a) the Egyptian Electricity Authority (EEA), a publicly-owned
enL-erprise responsible for almost all of the electricity generated and
transmitted in Egypt; (b) the Electricity Distribution Authority (EDA) which
coordinates seven regional distribution companies (EDCs); (c) the Hydro Power
Plants Executive Authority (HPPEA) which is responsible for constructing new
hydroelectric projects in coordination with the Ministry of Irrigation; (d)
the Rural Electrification Authority (REA), responsible for the construction of
distribution networks in urban and rural areas; and (e) the Nuclear Power
Plants Authority (NPPA), responsible for planning and construction of nuclear
plants. EEA and the distribution companies are the only entities holding
assets in the power subsector. Projects completed by HPPEA and REA have been
turned over for operation to either EEA or one of the distribution companies.
Energy Demand and Supply
1.09     Egypt at present is an energy surplus country and a net exporter of
oil. In 1987-88, total commercial energy production was about 53.0 MTOE. Oil
accounted for 83%, natural gas and condensates 12% and hydro electricity 5%.
Most of Egypt's hydropotential has already been harnessed. There will
therefore be no significant increase in the production of hydro electricity
between 1988-95. Following successful oil exploration activities, crude oil
production in the decade 1976-1986 increased faster than the rate of
consumption during the same period. Consequently, Egypt became a significant
net oil exporter and, in 1985-1986 oil exports accounted for 66% of total
exports. The current volume of oil production in Egypt at 44 million tons in
1987-88 has reached a plateau and, in the absence of new large discoveries, at
best, Egypt could maintain the plateau rate of production to 1996. With
domestic consumption accounting for 50% of oil production in 1987-88, any
increase in domestic oil consumption in the future will reduce exportable
surplus. Natural gas potential is a long-run solution to the trade-off
between domestic consumption and export of petroleum. The government has
056 911



- 4 .
given high priority to tlh development of its already discovered natural gas
reserves and, gas prodtictior is expeeted to increase from 5.2 MTOE in 1987-88
to 10.7 MTOE in 1995-96.
1.10     Over the last decadt- Egypt has experienced a relatively high growth
in energy consumption. Comnmervial energy consumption increased at an annual
rate of about 11% p.a. from 1974-75 to 1984-85. This high growth of commercial
energy consumption is mainly in response to rapid economic growth (8.4% per
year) and to falling real ;rices for petroleum products (a decline of 21%
between 1974-85) and electricity tariffs. However, the growth rates for
consumption of petroleum products slowed in 1984-85, and the rate of growth
turned negative in 1985-86 due to the lower growth in the economy.
Consumption of petroleum products and natural gas picked up and rose by 6.1%
p.s. between 1985-86 and 87-88. The total commercial energy consumption in
1987-88 was approximately 27.0 MTOE; 672 from oil, 24% (6.4 MTOE) from natural
gas and condensates aaid 9% (2.3 MTOE) from hydropower. Total electricity
consumption was 33 million GWh. Industry is the single largest consumer of
petroleum products and electricity, accounting for close to 452 of total
commercial energy consumption in 1987-88. The largest energy consuming
subsectors (in descending order) are chemicals and fertilizers, metals,
textiles and cement. Total consumption of non-commercial energy sources was
estimated at about 3 MTOE.
1.11     Egyptian authorities have estimated that primary commercial energy
consumption will increase at an average rate of 5% per year through 2000. At
this rate, commercial ene;gy consumption will be 37 MTOE by 1995 and 47.5 MTOE
by 2000. This rate of growth in domestic energy demand threatens to erode the
foreign exchange earniiigs by diverting exportable oil to domestic
consumption. If consumption continues to grow at 5% p.a. and natural gas
production is not rapidly expanded, then Egypt could become a net oil importer
by as early as 1996. It is therefore necessary to adopt demand management,
conservation and pricing measures to improve efficieticy in energy use and
reduce the rate of growth in energy consumption. With GDP growth rates
projected to average 3.82 p.a. to 1995, and assuming implementation of energy
sector reform measures as reaffirmed by the GOE (Para 1.02), energy demand is
projected to grow at a lower rate of 32 p.a. to 1995. Table 1.1 shows
commercial energy balance projections.

Enery Sector Po1ic.
1.12     Promoting efficient energy uso, pricing energy products and
electricity to reflect their economic costs, diversifying domestic energy
supplies by developing natural gas, and improving the management and
operational efficiency of energy sector institutions have been the principal
ingredients of Bank's policy dialogue in the energy sector. As outlined in
Para 1.02 above, GOE's plan incorporates these policy objectives and is making
efforts to implement these policy goals with specific action programs. In
pursuance of energy efficiency GOE has successfully designed and adopted an
energy rationalization program which includes three inter-relaLed measures:
(a) carrying out energy audits to help identify and evaluate campaigns aimed
at creating an awareness in industry and the general public of the potential
benefits from energy saving; (c) investing in energy technology for
retrofitting for fuel substitution; and finally (d) adjusting energy prices to
reflect economic costs. Under an USAID grant for energy rationalization, more
than 100 selected industrial and other entities are being audited. A Swedish
Government grant is helping to finance the preinvestment studies (including
energy audits) of five selected industrial plants, and a survey of the
potential for improving the combustion efficiency of industrial boilers. UNDP
has provided $200,000 to the Organization of Energy Planning (OEP) to carry
out energy audits in selected glass factories which are currcntly using
outdated technologies.
1.13     GOE has pursued policies to accelerate gas exploration, development
and production by liberalizing gas terms in production sharing agreements to
encnurage International Oil Companies (IOC's) to explore for and develop gas
fields. Following liberalization of gas clause in December 1986, GOE has
signed thirty new agreements with ten IOCs for undertaking oil and gas
exploration development. As a result of GOE's policies natural gas production
is expected to double from 5.2 MTOE in 1987-88 to 10.7 MTOE in 1995-96.
Energy Prices
1.14     Egypt's historical abundance of cheap hydropower, oil and gas has
allowed the Government to maintain domestic energy prices far below economic
levels. Between 1973-83, while the price of oil and other energy sources
increased substantially, in Egypt, domestic energy prices declined by 50% in
real terms. Since 1984, Government decided to begin increasing energy
prices. Between 1985-86 and 1988-89 the weighted average energy prices in
nominal terms increased by 2172 for petroleum products and natural gas, and by
180b for electricity. The CPI increased by 115% during the same period.
Thus, energy prices overall have increased faster than inflation. Table 1.2
below shows the current status of energy prices. These reflect the recent
(March 24, 1989) price increases for gas oil, kerosene, fuel oil, natural gas
and electricity. Between 1985-86 and 1988-89, domestic prices of petroleum
products and natural gas increased from 15% of world market prices in FY85-86
to 27% prices in 1986-87, and to 332 in 1987-88, and, to 36% in 1988-89.
Since world oil prices, and LE/US$ exchange rate are moving targets, domestic
energy prices as percentage of world oil prices continue to vary with changes
in these parameters. Based on present estimates of future world oil prices,
0569M



domestic inflation and exchange rate movements, a credible path to reach
economic energy price level to 1995 requires average annual price increases ot
about 35% in current Egyptian pounds.

that by June 1995 they will reach their economic levels, i.e., international
levels for petroleum products and long-run marginal cost (LRMC) for
electricity tariffs. However, given the socio-political sensitivities of
large increases in LPG and kerosene prices, the objective will be to reach
economic levels on a weighted average basis thereby allowing the Government to
continue to protect the poorest groups from the total impact of these
increases.

I. THE POWER SUBSECTOR
Institutional Framework
Egyptian Electricity Authority (EEA)
2.01     EEA was established in early 1976 under Law No. 12 of 1976 as part of
the general reorganization of the power sector by the Ministry of Electricity
and Energy. Under this law, EEA was made responsible for implementation,
management, operation and maintenance of all public service electric power
facilities in Egypt and it became financially autonomous from the Government
to the extent that it was able to prepare its own annual budget and five-year
plan subject to Government approval, retain any surplus revenues for its
development and contract loans from both foreign and local sources.
2.02     EEA is a government-owned enterprise regulated by the Ministry of
Electricity and Energy. It is managed by the chairman of the Board of
Directors assisted by five Deputy Chairmen, one for each of the main
functional areas (i.e., Projects, Operations, Personnel ane Administration,
Planning and Finance, Economic and Commercial Affairs Departments). The
Organization Chart of EEA is given in Annex 2.1. Geographically, EEA's
operations are divided between the Head Office in Cairo with responsibility
for overall planning and coordination and five regional offices or zones with
responsibility for operational matters. Each Zone is headed by a President
who manages the zone with the help of a Deputy Chairman from each of the main
functional areas.
2.03     EEA remains a highly centralized organization with cumbersome
administrative systems, little delegation of authority and little coordination
between technical and financial staff especially in planning matters.
However, EEA in general is reasonably well managed and rapidly being
modernized, in particular, in planning and setting up of a management
information system. EEA has launched a major program to improve the
management information system to allow management decision to be based on more
accurate and up-dated information. The program known as energy/electricity
Data Bank Program is being financed by UNDP and the GOE; and is being executed
by EEA/UNDTCD. The program implementation started in October 1984 and is
being executed in two phases for completion in 1991. Phase I has made a
preliminary assessment of EEA's planning/economic and financial functions and
made recommendations to upgrade EEA's technical/financial planning skills and
to improve coordination through reorganization of respective task units.
Phase I was completed in early 1987. The second phase which started in July
1987 is geared to developing a comprehensive and computerized
energy/electricity data Bank and setting up of the Management Information
System (MIS).
2.04     In the last decade EEA's permanent staff has increased at an average
rate of 3% p.a. It's total staff at present is about 33,000. Inspite of the
fast expansion of EEA's operations, the growth rate is modest. The staff
strength of EEA is characterized by shortage of qualified and experienced
05 6 911



- 10 -
staff for certain functiors such as engineers, technicians and accountants and
over staffing in clerical and semi-skilled functions. EEA is minimizing these
problems over the years by intensifying its training program and provision of
bonus to retain qualified and experienced staff on one hand and restricting
the recruitment of staff for activities which are already overmanned.
2.05     Presently, EEA has two adequately equipped training centers (in Cairo
North and Cairo South) specialized in generation and transmission
respectively. The latter is in the process of being developed to be a
National Training Center for Transmission. Since 1984/85 a training center
has become operational in Cairo North for training of staff in financial and
administrative functions. The traiiiing center in Cairo North provides four-
week ceurses in accounting and administrative functions. There is a plan to
train 4000 staff over the plan period in basic accounting and management
functions.  Moreover, EEA had, with World Bank financing (Ln. 1886-I-EGT),
concluded a training program with .he Electricite de France (EDF) for training
accountants.  This program has involved training of a total of 30 middle level
accountants in three groups of 10 each for a period of 3 months; 10 top level
accountants in five groups of 2 each for a period of 3 weeks and one financial
manager for one month to supervise the progress of the training program.
2.06     Fcor more technical training centers (in Uppe- Egypt, Delta Zone
Alexandria Zone, and Canal Zone) are now under implementation. The one in
Alexandria (financed by the British Government) is expected to start operation
by the end of 1989. The training center in the Canal Zone is financed by West
Germany. The World Bank Loan 1886-EGT is financing
the Upper Egypt Zone training center. The feasibility study for a training
center for Lower Egypt Zone have already been completed and the financing is
being secured from Czechoslovakia. These centers will provide training in
both generation and transmission. EEA plans to provide training in its
centers for not less than 3000 engineers and 5000 technicians during the plan
period (19871/88-1991/92).
Electricity Distribution Authority (EDA)
2.07     The authority was established in November 1983 under Law No. 97, to
act as a holding company with overall management and control functions over
all the seven Distribution Companies (EDCs). The management of the EDA
consists of a chairman and a Board of Directors appointed by the President of
Egypt on the recommendation of the Minister of Electricity and Energy. The
Organization chart of EDA is given in Annex 2.2. The Board of Directors
consists of the Chairman of the EDA, five Chairmen from the EDCs, the chairman
of REA, one legal expert, one financial expert and representative of the
employees.
2.08     Distribution Companies are Government-owned enterprises under the
regulation of the Ministry of Electricity and Energy which exercises overall
management control functions through the EDA. Shareholdings in the EDCs are
held by EEA and local governments. Each EDC is headed by a Chairman who
presides over an Executive Board of Directors of no less than five and not
more than nine members. The EDCs are responsible for preparing their annual
budgets and five-year plans, submitting them to the EDA, which consolidates
056914



- ii -
the budgets and five-year plans of all the companies before submitting them to
the Ministries of Planning and Finance for approval.
2.09     Under previous and ongoing loans, a major problem with implications
for suhsector planning and management has been t'l.e lack of an adequate and
coherent accounting and management information system for the subsector as a
whole. The problem worsened by the fact that while EEA had the need and
obligation to collect information from the EDCs, it had no formal control over
the companies. The formation of the EDA may now provide a formal channel
through which EEA can assemble subsector data necessary for management and
planning decisions.
Existing Power Facilities
2.10     EEA owns and operates 38 generating stations linked to the
interconnected grid. In 19:7-88 the total installed capacity was 8963 MW, of
which 52% (4655 MW) was oil-fired steam units, 17% tl563 MW) combustion
turbine units and 311 (2745 MW) hydro units. EEA also has generating capacity
at isolated centers. The largest isolated station is at Marsa Matruh where
the existing capacity is 13 MW.  Statistical iaformation on power plants is
given in Annex 2.3.
2.11     EEA's transmission system includes 1576 kilometers of 500-kv line to
connect the hydro plants in the south (Aswan) with the load cen;ers and
thermal plants in the northern part of the country (Cairo and the Nile
Delta). A 220-kv network, totalling 3872 kilometers, serves mainly the
northern Egypt loads, and 132-kv lines (2294 km) serve the loads in upper
Egypt.
2.12     The distribution networks belong to the distribution companies with a
substation capacity of 13,260 MVA and total distribution line length of
7,438/kms.
Electricity Consumption
2.13     During 1974/5-84/5 electricity consumption grew at an average annual
rate of 12% p.a. This high rate of growth was mainly due to high GDP rates of
growth averaging 8.4% p.a., low electricity tariffs, expansion of electricity
distribution and starting up of new energy intensive aluminium (Nag Hammadi)
smelter. The rate of growth in electricity generation declined to 6.72 in
85-86, mainly because of reduced economic growth. However, in 1986-87, the
rate of growth in electricity consumption increased to 121 and fell again to
7.1% in 1987-88. Annex 2.4 shows historical electricity consumption and
sectoral pattern of consumption.
Electricity Demand Forecast
2.14     Assuming implementation of economic reforms including adjustment of
domestic energy prices to their economic levels, industrial restructuring and
J,ad-management to reduce peak demand electricity consumption is projected to
slow down and grow at about 7.0% p.a. between 1987/88 and 1991/92, and slowing
down further to 6.01 p.a. during 1991/1992-96/97. This projection is
0 5 6 9MH



- 12 -
consistent with key assumptions of projected lower rates of growth in GDP,
industrial oroduction and government's energy policy focussing on tariff
increases, demand management and conservation measures. Electricity
consumption in the industrial sector is projected to increase on average at a
very low rate of growth of 1.6% p.a. to 1990 and improve thereafter, to about
3.5% p.a. to 1997, reflecting the impact of electricity price increases and
more efficient energy use. and low projected rates of growth in industrial
production.
2.15     Residential/commercial demand shows less relationship with economic
growth and could grow rapiely for some time even with slow economic growth as
new customers are attached and existing customers increase demand from current
low levels (in 1986/87 647 of residential customers took less than 100 kWh per
month). From 1980/81 to 1985/86 residential/commercial demand grew by an
average 197 per year, although the growth slowed to 127 between 1985/86 and
1987/88 which, however, reflected declining rate of growth in gross national
energy consumption. Residential/commercial energy consumption is projected to
grow at 11.57 per year between 1987/88 and 1991/92 but gradually slow down to
97 by 1997/98 as the current high rate of household electrification would
decrease. Key assumptions and demand forecast are shown in Annex 2.4.
Electrcity Taiffs
2.16     The electricity tariff structure in Egypt is relatively simple.  Very
high voltage and high voltage customers pay only a kwh rate. Public sector
customers who use electricity at medium or low voltage pay both a kwh rate and
demand charge per kw. Residential and commercial customers pay a kwh rate
which increases for successively higher blocks of consumption per month. The
current tariff structure is provided in Annex 2.5.
2.1i     The Ministry of Electricity and Energy has taken several steps since
1982 for increasing the tariff of all types of consumers. Between 1982 and
1989 cumulative rates of tariff increases for : very high voltage, for high
voltage, for medium voltage were 4677, 436%, and 206% respectively.  The
average cumulative tarift Increase for all consumers was 3242 or about 19%
p.a. on an average during the same period. Despite these large increases,
because of the very low base the levels of electricity tariffs in Egypt are
substantiall- below the levels that would convey to consumers the cost of
resources (both in economic and financial terms) used to supply electricity.
The Bank's efforts are being directed towards improving both the structure and
level of electricity tariffs. As a result the Government/MEE have initiated
several steps in this direction. These include: (i) government's proposed
objective to raise fuel prices and electricity tariffs to reach economic
levels by June 1995; (ii) 352 increase in electricity tariffs implemented in
1985/86; (iii) 29. increase in electricity tariffs implemented in 1986/87; and
(iv) and 30.57 increase in electricity tariff implemented as of March 24,
1989; and (v) improvement in tariff structure by design and implementation of
load management measures to all Extra High, High and Medium Voltage consumers
including the implementation of peak load pricilsg. Further measures to
improve load management will be implemented under this proposed Loan.
2.18     Electricity tariffs designed to reflect the longrun marginal cost
(LRMC) of electricity supply is a desirable economic objective for eliminating
056 9 tt



- I] - 
subsidies, for correcting distort ,ons; ill the economy, for promoting energy
conservation, and, finally, for revenue goneration and resource mobilization
to ease the budgetary constraints. Using international price for fuel oil,
the LRMC of electricity is aplI)ximaLtely 16.8 piastres per kwh.  The current
average tariff rate after March 24, 1989 increase is 242 of the economic
cost. It must be emphasized that a review of the electricity pricing policies
should be based on an update ot the tariff study carried out by EEA by EEA's
consultants Sofrelec (France) in 1982/83. An update of the tariff study
should e:xtamine not only the structure and behavior of consumer groups but also
the diversified sources of available fuel, including natural gas. EEA is
currently in the process of updating the tariff study. USAID is financing the
consultancy services for the study. The Terms of Reference for the study have
been prepared and the study is expectad to be completed by 1990/91 which would
then form the basis for periodic tariff adjustments.  Such tariff adjustments
should generate sufficient internal resources to finance a reasonable
proportion of the investment program. Assurances from the Government have
been obtained requiring: (i) for FY90 and subsequent years annual tariff
increases to be implemented to ensure a gradual improvement in the financial
performance of the power subsector such that the subsector would achieve
internal cash generation targets of 35% by FY94 and thereafter (Chapter IV).
The effect of these increases would ensure progressive adjustments in the cost
of supply for all categories of constumers except for residential consumers
using less than 100 kwh per month, thereby providing protection for the poor
in furtlierance of the Government.'s social objectives.
Power System Planning and Lnvestmen'; Proga
2.19     Generation and transmission system planning is done by EEA with the
assistance of consultants. The generation planning is currently done by EEA
using the WASP Tii model.  The principal generation and transmission planning
personnel are sufficiently trained and experienced. Under the UNDP/EEA energy
Data Bank Project, EVA has acquired the Electric Generaticn Expansion Analysis
System (EGEAS), load flow, statistical and decision analysis models that
operate on a personal computer. With the acquisition of these models, EEA has
the necessary tools to perform system planning studies and least cost
investment programs.
2.20     Based on the modest rate of growth in electricity consumption
averaging 7.0% p.a. to 1992 and to 6.0%, thereafter, the power subsector's
total investment program for the period 1987/88 to 1994/95 is estimated to be
LE 12.8 billion (in 1989 prices). The Bank has reviewed the investment
program and finds it to be least cost and reasonable in relation to the demand
forecast. The Government has reviewed the program in the five year plan
context and is responsible for securing the necessary financing from external
and internal sources. Annex 2.6 gives a list of major planned and/or
committed generation and transmission projects durirg 1987/88 to 1994/95.
Approximately 2900 MW equivalent of generating plants including rehabilitation
are at different stages of construction with financing from ADB, EIB, Arab
Fund, Islamic Development Bank and USAID and bilateral financing from West
Germany, Italy, France, Switzerland, Hungary and Japan, etc., (Chapter IV).

Role of IDA/Bank
2.21     The World Bank group has been involved in nine operations in Egypt's
energy sector of which five are in the power subsector, three in the gas
subsector, and one IFC operation in the oil development and exploration
project. These operations include:
FY77 - Loan 1453-EGT - Regional Electrification (US$48 million)
FY79 - Loan 1732-EGT - Gulf of Suez Petroleum & Gas Exploration (US$75 million)
FY79 - Credit 935-EGT/Loan 1733-EGT/Special Action Cr. 20-EGT - Power II
Shoubrah El Kheima (Credit US$37 million, Loan US$102 million,
Special Action Credit US$35 million)
FY80 - Credit 1052-EGT/Loan 1886-EGT - Power III (Credit US$120 million,
Loan US$7 million)
FY81 - Loan 1928-EGT - Western Desert Exploration Project (US$25 million)
FY82 - Loan 2103-EGT - Abu Qir Gas Development (US$90 million)
FY84 - Loan 1886-1-EGT - Power Supplemental (US$59 million)
FY86 - Loan 2594-EGT - Vocational Training III (US$19.3 million)
IFC has made one investment.
FY86 - Investnent Nc. 873-EGT - Meleiha Oil Development and Exploration
Project (US$19.5 million).
2.22     These operations have made substantial contributions to the
development of Egypt's energy sector. They have (i) financed exploration of
oil and gas in the Western Desert, leading to the discovery of commercial gas
reserves; (ii) facilitated associated gas utilization, which otherwise would
have been flared, from oil fields in the Gulf of Suez, by financing gathering,
processing and marketing of associated gas; (iii) financed the extension of
natural gas to domestic consumers in Cairo and industrial customers in
Alexandria; (iv) facilitated the extension of electricity service in urbar, and
rural areas; (v) supported the construction of three 300 MW units at Shoubrah
El Kheima power station and four 67.5 MW hydropower units at the old Aswan
Dam; (vi) financed technical assistance for improved planning for the
development to the power subsector including the formulation of a least-cost
investment program; improved financial reporting and cost-accounting systems
and implementation of various training programs.
Sector Issues and Bank Strategy
2.23     Bank group operations in the power subsector have been designed to
support the development of a rapidly expanding and modern power system. The
issues fa^ing the subsector are mainly in the areas of electricity pricing and
conservation, choice of generation technology, investment planning and
financing of investment program, institutional reforms and efficiency
improvements. The last five operations in the power subsector have addressed
these issues and progress has been made 4n all these areas. The progress made
thus far includes: introduction of load management measures, efficiency
improvement measures, improvement in EEA's planning and demand forecasting
systems and annual tariff increases since 1982-83. However, more remains to
be done. The major objectives of Bank's involvement in the power sector would
be institutional development of the power entities, introduction of a pricing
policy that would ensure their financial viability and economic efficiency in
O s 6 9 11



- is -
power consumption and system efficiency to provide reliable and economic power
supply. Through our lending operations, our objectives in the subsector are
to achieve the goal of economic pricing, to rationalize tariff structure so
that supply in each category of consumer reflects economic costs, to implement
specific action program for annual electricity tariff increase to ensure
progressive improvement in financial cost recovery and internal cash
generation of EEA, to improve operating efficiency through rehabilitation,
load management programs, power system controls, reducing power losses; and to
improve power system planning and coordination of demand forecasting,
investment planning, accounting, reporting and management information
systems. The proposed project would enable the Bank to continue its efforts
towards achieving the above objectives, while building on the achievements
under the previous loans and the power investment study carried out in 1985
and updated in 1987.

III. THE PROJECT
Objectives and Rationale for Bank Financing
3.01     The project would assist EEA to alleviate power shortages and meet
growing demand and to improve the efficiency of the existing power plant. The
project also transfers technology, particularly in high efficiency combined
cycle power plant construction and operation. Further objectives would be the
establishment of an improved accounting system, management information system
(Paras. 4.01 through 4.03), and a comprehensive training and technical
assistance programs to address various sectoral/subsectoral issues such as
energy pricing (Paras. 1.14 and 1.15), load management, electricity tariffs
(Paras. 2.17 through 2.18), environmental activities (Para. 3.27 through 3.31)
and establishment of a computerized energy data bank for systematic
reporting. The Bank's invoivement would provide a continuing dialogue with
the Government and EEA with the objective of ensuring rational investments in
power development, that energy resources are priced correctly and allocated
efficiently, and the Bank's presence would provide a strong incentive to
mobilize foreign financial resources for power subsector development through
effective cofinancing.
Project Description
3.02     The project, which is described in detail in Annex 3.1, would consist
of the following components:
(a) construction of a combined cycle power plant with a total capacity of
about 1080 MW at Faraskur (Damietta) in the Delta Region and a
housing colony nearby for the plant operating staff;
(b) providing 138 MW of net additional generating capacity by conversion
to combined cycle of the existing industrial tyDe combustion turbines
at Mahmoudia and Damanhour power stations;
(c) construction of 380 km of 220-kv transmission lines and addition cf
500 MVA of transformer capacity in the substations for efficient
transmission of the generation in the power plants (a) and (b) to the
load centers; and
(d) providing technical assistance to the Borrower for: (i) the
engineering consulting services for (a), (b) and (c) above; (ii) load
research and load management techniques; (iii) the installation of
tower testing facilities for transmission lines; (iv) the
installation of the energy/electricity data bank and management
information system; and (v) the environmental activities.
3.03     Damietta Power Station Component.  The combined cycle power plant
(Paras. 2 through 7 of Annex 3.1) will have three combined cycle modules with
a total nominal site rating of 1080 MW. Each 360 MW module consisting of two
120 MW combustion turbine/generator and 120 MW steam turbine/generator
capacity together with auxiliaries and peripheral facilities. The plant is
situated to the north of the Faraskur town and about 2.5 km southeast of Kafr
El Battikh in the Damietta Governorate, and adjacent to the Damietta branch of
056 911



- 17 -
the River Nile. Selected land for the project has already been acquired by
the Government for the construction without any resettlement issues. The
primary fuel will be natural gas from the Abu Maadi gas field. An underground
gas pipeline of about 45 km for supplying natural gas to the power station has
already been completed. The combustion turbines are also capable of burning
distillate fuel oil (solar oil) as an alternate and emergency back-up fuel.
The station would use about 3.6 x l06Nm3 of gas per day for 1,080 MW
capacity (or about 4 x 106Nm3 p.d. for 1,188 MW output that is at 10% over
load). Water for the condenser cooling system will be drawn from the Nile by
an intake and the pump house to be constructed on the river bank. The
condenser cooling water will be discharged back to the Nile. The power plant
has been connected to the interconnected power system via two 220-kV double
circuit transmission lines to the Damietta town substation (about 13 km) and
to the Kasabi substation (about 44 km). The third 220-kV double circuit
transmission line being constructed under the project would connect the power
station to the Mahalla substation (about 80 km). In addition, the project
provides for the construction of 380 km of 220-kV double circuit transmission
lines and for the addition of 500 MVA transformer capacity in the substations
to efficiently transmit the generation from Damietta, Mahmoudia and Damanhour
power stations.
3.04     Mahmoudia and Damanhour Power Stations Component.  At present,
Mahmoudia power station has eight industriel type combustion turbines (in open
cycle) with a nominal site rating of 24 MW each and four aero-derivative type
combustion turbines (open cycle) with a nominal site rating of 50 MW each; the
nearby Damanhour power station has four combustion turbines of industrial type
similar to those at the Mahmoudia power station. These open cycle combustion
turbines, with low capital cost per kw and low net thermal efficiency (about
24 to 26X), were meant for peak load operations with an annual plant load
factor of less than 30X. However, due to inadequate installed generation
capacity in the interconnected system, the industrial type combustion turbines
at Mahmoudia and Damanhour power stations are run at annual load factors (of
about 60%) meant for generating plant operating at base load. The areo-
derivative type combustion turbines at Mahmoudia, however, operate at low load
factors due to low availability and maintenance problems. The situation
regarding inadequate generating capacity in EEA's interconnected system is not
likely to improve till the end of the century. Therefore, with the
availability of natural gas for power generation, the conversion of open cycle
combustion turbines to more efficient combined cycle operation (about 40% net
thermal efficiency) offered considerable economic benefits. The study
completed in May 1987 by the consultants, Electricity Supply Board (ESB),
Ireland and reviewed by the Bank confirmed the economics of converting to
combined cycle, the existing 12 open cycle industrial type combustion turbines
at Mahmoudia and Damanhour power stations. The conversion to combined cycle
would improve the net thermal efficiency of these combustion turbines from 26%
to about 40X. The heat from the exhaust gases of the combustion turbines
would be utilized to produce steam in the Heat Recovery Steam Generators
(HRSGs) which are basically unfired boilers. The steam, in turn would drive
the steam turbines to generate additional power. There would be two combined
cycle modules at the Mahmoudia power station and one similar module at the
Damanhour power station. Each module comprises four (existing) 24-MW
combustion turbines, four (new) HRSGs and one (new) steam turbine of 46 MW
(net) capacity. Thus, there tfould be an addition of 92 MW (net) capacity at
Mahmoudia and an addition of 46 MW (net) capacity at the Damanhour power

station. Simply stated, for the same gas consumption, the combined cycle
operation would produce 50b more electricity than the open cycle operation in
the two power plants. The project component is discussed in detail in Annex
3.1 (Paras. 8 through 12).
3.05     Transmission Lines and Substations Component.  The proposed
transmission lines would strengthen the interconnection system around the
Talkha, Tanta, Tahrir Badr (Tahrir I) , Mahmoudia, Mahalla and Etay-El-Barod
substations. In addition, the component includes two 220/66-kV stepdown
substations (Faraskur and El Boustan) which are essential for improving the
voltage conditions and for meeting the future load demand around these
substations. The project component is discussed in detail in Annex 3.1 (Paras
13 and 14).
3.06     Technical Assistance Component.  The component includes pre-
construction phase and construction phase engineering consultancy services
required for the Damietta, Mahmoudia and Damanhour, and thi transmission lines
and substations components. In addition, the component provides for the
following:
(a)  consultancy services, computer hardware and software, and instruments
required for the implementation of the load measurement/load
management proposals recommended by EEA's consultant, ESB, Ireland
under the study financed by the Bank from the Shoubrah El Kheima and
the Third Power projects (Para 15 of Annex 3.1);
(b)  consultancy services and measuring instruments required for tower
testing facility being established by EEA (Para. 15 of Annex 3.1);
(c)  consultancy services and training facilities for EEA's technical and
financial staff;
(d)  additional technical assistance required (Para. 17 of Annex 3.1) for
preparation and implementation of the management information system
(MIS) by EEA and the DCs; and
(e)  a technical nssistance program regarding environmental activities of
EEA (Para 3.30).
The technical assistance component does not include the training for EEA's
operation and maintenance staff for the project which is provided under the
major supply and erection contracts.
Project Cost
3.07     The total project cost excluding interest during construction
(US$127.2) is estimated to be about LE 2,255.1 million (US$721.3 million) of
which 82%, amounting to LE 1,832.1 million (U$588.8 million), is in foreign
exchange. A summary of the cost estimate for the principal components of the
project is shown below and a detailed estimate is given in Annex 3.2.

The base project cost is in April 1, 1989 prices and as estimated by the two
pre- construction phase engineering consultants for components I and II, and
by EEA for the components III and IV. These estimates were reviewed by the
Bank's mission and are considered to be reasonable for this type of project.
The cost estimates include customs duties and taxes as shown in Annex 3.2.
Except for the actual expenditure incurred in 1988 (Annex 3.2), overall
physical contingencies of 102 are added exce ?t for the civil works for which
152 physical contingencies have been added.    An exchange rate of I US$ =
LE2.41 has been used for converting base cost and physical contingencies from
one currency to another. Price contingencies are added to the base cost plus
physical contingencies on the following annual inflation rate projections:
Year                            1989   1990  1991   1992   1993   1994   1995

It is estimated that about 2,300 man-months of consultancy services would be
required and are included in the technical assistance component (para. 3.06).
The project cost does not include US$4.5 million funded by the Bank (tinder
Loani 1733-EGT) for the preconstruction phase consultancy services for the
component.
Proect Financng
3.08     The tinancing plan for the project is summarized in Table 3.2.  The
Bank funding would mainly cover the foreign exchange requirements of: (a)
component 11 (Table 3.1) for Mabmoudia and Damanhour power stations; (b) the
component III for transmission lines and substations, except for US$1S million
(Table ' ") from the Islamic Development Bank (IDB) for the Faraskur- Mahalla
220-kV transmission line; and (c) component IV for the technical assistance
except for consultancy services for component I (Damietta combined cycle).
The African Development Bank (ADB) is mainly funding the foreign exchange
requirements of component I for (i) combustion turbines (modules land 2); (ii)

consultancy services. European Investment Bank (EIB) would mainly cover the
foreign exchange requirements of component I for: (a) civil works/electro-
mechanical equipment (depending on the contractor being from an eligible
country); and (b) a portion of the consultancy services. EEA would cover all
local currency requirements of the project and, in addition, would cover the
foreign _..xchange requirements for: (i) the project insurance for the
components I, II, ana III; (ii) combustion turbines, site piling works and
switchyard for module 3 of the compoaent I; (iii) civil works/electro-
mechanical equipment (portions not covered by EIB) for the component I; (iv)
portion of the consultancy services for the component I (which are not covered
by AF and EIB; and (v) interest during construction (local and foreign).
/I  No physical or price contingencies are added for the actual expenditure
incurred in 1988 (Annex 3.2).

Procurement
3.10     All Bank-financed procurement for civil works, and supply and
installation of materials and equipment would be according to Bank's
Procurement Guidelines. Procurement of technical assistance services would
follow Bank's Guidelines for use of consultants by World Bank Borrowers in
Bank-financed projects.
3.11     Bank financing is proposed for the following eight main procurement
packages:
(a) civil works for component II (Table 3.1) for conversion to combined
cycle of the existing open cycle industrial type combustion turbines
at Mahmoudia and Damanhour power stations;
(b) supply and installation of the 12 HRSGs (including instrumentation
and controls) for component II;
(c) supply and installation of the steam turbines for component II;
(d) electrical equipment (including switchyard) for component II;
(e) supply of materials for the transmission lines (except for 80 km of
transmission line funded by IDB) under component III;
(f) supply and installation of substation material and equipment
(including associated civil works) for component III;
(g) engineering consultancy services (preconstruction phase and
construction phase) for components II and III; and
(h) consultancy services including equipment and instruments for
implementing EEA's program for: load management and tower testing;
training; data bank; and environmental services.

- 22 -
Except for small value items under (d), (e), (f) and (h), International
Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedure according to Bank's Procurement Guidelines
would be folloved for items (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), and equipment and
instruments for item (h); procurement of technical assistance services would
follow Bank's Guidelines for use of consultants by World Bank borrowers.
International shopping, according to Bank's Procurement Guidelines would be
followed for procurement of small-value items such as: (i) tools, instruments,
relays and fittings required for the packages (d), (e) and (f); and (ii)
tools, instruments, computer hardware and software for carrying out the
program under the package (h). Procurement following International Shopping
procedure would involve obtaining three price offers for the required gaods
from at least two eligible source countries - such procurement being limited
to US$40,000 per contract and US$600,000 in the aggregate.
3.12     Direct contracting following Bank's Procurement Guidelines would be
followed for: (i) the extension of the contract for switchyard (under
component I) by US$ 4.0 million for providing matching Gas Insulated
Switchgear (GIS) for the 220/66-kV Faraskur substation (under component III)
funded by the Bank; and (ii) obtaining instruments, relays, recorders and
fittings (about US$100,000) to match the existing equipment in the Mahmoudia
and Damanhour power stations (package (d)). The switchyard contract was
awarded to the lowest evaluated !)idder, AEG, Federal Republic of Germany
following ICB procedures of ADB (the financing agency) for an amount of about
US$26 million. The proposed extension would mean addition of three GIS
circuit breakers (with associated control panels and relays) to the existing
26 GIS circuit breakers. In order to maintain uniformity and standardization
of equipment EEA requested for direct contracting with AEG for the extension
of the GIS switchgear. The request was reviewed and found to be reasonable.
Accordingly, the total foreign expenditure under this procedure would be
limited to about US$4.1 million.
3.13     Before appointing engineering consultants for the construction phase
for components II and III (if needed), EEA would submit to the Bank a
short-list of consultants according to bank's guidelines by the end of August
1989. EEA should invite offers and award contract for the consultancy
services by the end of December 1989.
3.14     EEA has in its possession all the land necessary for the project.
However, a token provision of about US$0.4 million in local currency is
provided for land acquisition, if required. EEA would follow appropriate
regulations prevailing in the country when acquiring additional land that may
be required for the project. Since the land requirement, if any, for the
substations would be modest, no resettlement problems are foreseen.
3.15     EEA would follow its own bidding procedure for award of contract
financed by EEA for the installation of transmission lines under package (e).
In view of the scattered nature of the work, the proposed arrangement is
satisfactory. Similar arrangement was followed for the regional
electrification component funded by IDA under Credit 1052-EGT.

Disbursements and Special Accounts
3.17     The proceeds of the loan would be disbursed over a period of seven
years (1989-1995) on the following basis:
(a)  lC01% of foreign (US$11.5 million) expenditures for civil works of
component II;
(b)  1002 of foreign (US$34.0 million) expenditures for the supply and
inst^llat on of HRSGs for component II;
(c)  1002 of foreign expenditures (US$33.6 million) for the supply and
installation of steam turbines for component 11;
(d)  100l   of 'oreign expeniditures (US$11.3 million) for the supply and
instailation of electrical equipment for component II;

e: .enditure, ex-factory) for the supply of transmission line material
f.- component III;
(f)  1002 of foreign expenditures US$23,6 million) for the supply ond
installation of equipmeuit (including civil works for the substations
undez component III;
(g)  100? of foreign expenditures for the preconstruction and construction
phase engineering consultancy services (US$7.8 million) for
components II and III;
(h)  100% of foreign expenditures (US$2.2 million) for the consultancy
services to be provided under component IV for: (i) load management
and power testing; (ii) training; (iii) Data Bank and Management
In`orm&tion System (MIS);
(i)  1007 of foreign expenditures (US$2.1 million c.i.f.) for supply of
ir.s_.ruments, recorders, and equipment to be provided for project
components II, III and IV.
3.18     The disbursement schedule (Annex 3.3) follows generally the Bank's
standard disbursement profiles for EMENA power projects. In order to enable
EEA to effectively implement the project and to ensure prompt payments to
contracto's and consultants, the Bank would advance funds as needed to a
special as.ount to be opened at a commercial bank in Egypt for a maximum
amount of "S$10.0 million which is expected to cover the Bank's share of
eligible expenditures over a period of four months. The account will be
denominated in US dollars and replenished against withdrawal applications of
at least US$100,000. Applications with appropriate supporting documentation
should be submitted when appioximately half of the maximum allocated amount of
the account has been spent. All disbursements under the project would be made
against standard documentation except for contracts less than US$100,000
equivalent. These would be claimed under statement of expenditures; related
documentation would be retained for review by the Bank missions/representative
and audited by independent auditors acceptable ti the Bank.

3.19     Retroactive Financing and Advance Contracting.  Retroactive financing
of up to U$400,000 would be allowed to cover expenditures incurred for the
activities of the consu3tants contracted for preconstruction phase assistance
to EEA (Para 3.22).
3.20     The Loan Closing Date would be December 31, 1995.
Projeet Implementation
3.21     Damietta Combined Cycle (Component I).  The contract for the
combustion turbines was awarded in December 1987 and four combustion tulrbines
out of the six to be installed have been commissioned in the open cycle mode.
The remaining two turbines are scheduled to be commissioned in the open cycle
mode by September 1989. The contract for the HRSGs was signed in April 1989;
the contract for steam turbines is scheduled to be signed in June 1989. The
contracts for civil works and electro-mechanical equipment is scheduled to be
awarded in 1989. The operation of the power plant is scheduled for 1992.
3.22     Mahmoudia and Damanhour Power Stations (component II).  The
feasibility studyz-'- and the basic bidding documents for the component were
completed by the consultant, ESB, Ireland in May 1987. To save time, EEA
proposed to continue the services of the consultant, ESB, Ireland for the pre-
construction phase of the project. The consultant would assist EEA in the
procurement process till the award and signing of the contracts for the four
bid packages. For the construction phase engineering consultancy services EEA
shall prepare a short list of the consultants and submit it to the Bank for
its review by the end of August 1989, so as to ensure contract award for the
consultancy services by the end of December 1989. To maintain the proposed
project schedule for the component (Annex 3.4), it is essential that the
natural gas pipeline at the Mahmoudia power station is relocated by the end of
November 1989; the present route of pipeline within the power station
interferes with the proposed layout for the combined cycle operation. It is
also advisable to replace the existing low pressure pipeline at the Damanhour
power station by a high pressure pipeline from the neighboring Damanhour
thermal power station. This will avoid the use of gas compressors for
supplying the gas at the desired pressure to the combustion turbines.
Further, it would also reduce the station auxiliary consumption at Damanhour
by half (from 22 to less than 1X). EEA had scheduled to complete this work in
1987 but the work has not been started as yet. To avoid the interference with
the contractors' work, it is advisable that EEA completes the work of
providing high pressure gas pipeline to Damanhour power station by the end of
June 1990. The power stations of Mahmoudia and Damanhour are about 18 km
apart and, therefore, it is advantageous to issue one tender for both power
stations for similar type of work. The procurement action takes this into
account (Table 3.3). The contracts for the four bid packages under
component II are scheduled to be awarded in the first half of 1990 and the
combined cycle operation at both power stations is scheduled for completion by
the end of March 1994 (Annex 3.4). Assurance has been obtained from EEA that
adequate quantity of natural gas would be allocated for

station.
3.23     Transmission lines and Substations (component III).  EEA has been
satisfactorily planning and executing the work of 220-kV t ansmission lines
and substations. Therefore, no provision is made for the :econstruction
phase engineering consultancy services. No need for engiE: ering consultancy
services is anticipated for the construction phase. However, a nominal amount
of US$0.5 million is provided in the project cost for technical assistance, if
needed. Component III is scheduled for commissioning by the end of 1993.
3.24     Technical Assistance (component IV).  EEA has continued the services
of the preconstruction phase engineering consultants, Overseas Bechtel
Incorporated/Electric Power System of Egypt (OBI/EPS) for the construction
phase of the Damietta combined cycle power station (component I). EEA has
proposed to continue the services of the consultant ESB, Treland for the
preconstruction phase engineering consultancy services for the component II
(Para 3.22). For the construction phase engineering consultancy services for
the component II, EEA will short-list the consultants and ensure that the
consultancy contract is awarded by the end of December 1989 (Para 3.13). As
regards other activities of component II EEA will follow the Bank's Guidelines
for use of consultants in Bank-financed projects for award of contracts. The
load management and load research activities would continue till the end of
1992. Agreement has been reached that by December 31, 1990 EEA will prepare
and provide the Bank, a plan for implementation of measures of the Load
Management Study taking into account Bank's comments thereon. The tower
testing facilities and training activities are scheduled for completion by the
end of June 1992. The training activity would provide assistance for training
EEA's staff and for manpower planning. Technical assistance under component
IV would provide supplemental support for the ongoing Data Bank and MIS
activities carried out under the UNDP project (EGY/81/037 Electricity Data
Bank). These activities are scheduled for completion by June 30, 1993.
3.25     Project Management.  Deputy Chairman for Projects located at EEA's
headquarters would be responsible for management of project components I, II
and III and engineering consultancy services under component IV. The
day-to-day construction activities at site would be the responsibility of the
President, Delta Zone assisted by the Power Station Superintendent for
Damietta combined cycle power station (component I). Similarly, the
President, Alexandria Zone, assisted by the Power Station Superintendents of
Mahmoudia and Damanhour, would be responsible for the site activities of the
component II. The transmission lines and substations of component III are
spread over Alexandria and Delta ones. The respective presidents would be
responsible for construction activities of the transmission lines and
substation located within their zonal boundaries. These arrangements have
been employed by EEA for previous projects and are satisfactory. The
technical assistance activities under component IV (except for the engineering
consultancy services for components I, II and III and training) shall be under
the Deputy Chairman for studies, research and planning loce.ted at the
headquarters. The technical assistance activities for training will be the
responsibility of the Deputy Chairman for Administration and Training located
at the headquarters.

3.26     Project Implementation Schedule.  The project implementation schedule
is given in Annex 3.4 with a project completion date of March 31, 1994.  Annex
3.5 gives the broad requirements for monitoring the project. These would
assist EEA in providing the Bank, at regular semi-annual intervals, the
information required during supervision of the project. On completion of the
project EEA will prepare a project completion report based on the outlines
agreed with the Bank.
Environment
3.27     Damiettd Combined Cycle (component I).  The proposed site at Faraskur
(Damietta) was found to be environmentally acceptable. The land requirement
was modest (only 20,000 m2) since the combustion turbines would normally
burn gas and use distillate fuel oil (solar oil) in case of emergencies only.
There were no resettlement problems for the land acquired for the power
station. The plant design meets the air and water pollution standards
acceptable to the Bank. Unlike the conventional thermal power plant where the
total installed capacity is in the steam turbines which require large
quantities of circulating water, the combined cycle operation lhas only 1/3rd
of the installed capacity in the steam turbines and 2/3rd of the capacity is
in the combustion turbines. Therefore, for the same capacity of power
station, the combined cycle operation requires about 1/3rd of the cooling
water compared to a conventional thermal power plant. Only the condenser
cooling water will be discharged in the Nile river. The cold water inlet and
warm water outlet of the cooling water system have been designed to meet the
regulations of the country. All wastewater will be treated prior to discharge
into drainage canals located in the area and would meet the standards laid
down by the Government (Law 48 - Ministry of Irrigation).
3.28     Mahmoudia and Damanhour Power Stations (component II).  The open
cycle combustion turbines at the two power stations meant for peaking load
operation are, however, run like base load units (Para 3.04). After conversion
to combined cycle operation, these combustion turbines would still be running
as base load units burning similar amounts of natural gas. However for the
same quantity of natural gas used, the combined cycle operation would generate
502 more electricity compared to the open cycle operation. As a result, per
unit of generation, combined cycle mode would release less pollution to the
atmosphere. The source of cooling water for the Mahmoudia power station would
be the Mahmoudia canal. The total cooling water requirement (5.68 m3/sec) for
the two 46-MW steam turbines at Mahmoudia, represents less than 5% of the
present maximum flow of canal (120m3/sec) in summer months.  Therefore the
warm cooling water discharged in the canal would produce a fully mixed
temperature rise of only 0.24c and the maximum temperature of the warm
cooling water discharged into the canal would not exceed 35c. These
results are based on a model test carried out by the consultants ESB,
Ireland. During the winter months on occasions, the canal water flow rate may
drop to 23m3/sec. Even under these conditions, it would be ensured that the
warm cooling water outlet is located such that the mixed canal temperature
rise does not exceed 1c. The cooling water source for Damanhour power
station would be near the influence of the Mahmoudia and Khandak El Sharky
canals. There are two thermal power plants of 195 MW (existing) and 300 MW
(under construction) capacities and take its cooling water requirements from
the same source. Before starting construction of the 300 MW power station,
oS 6 9SM



29 
ENEL, Italy carried out a study of the hydrothermal impact of the 300 mw mnit
on the Mahmoudia and Khandak El Sharky canals. The consultants ESB, Ireland
superimposed the cooling water requirements of the additional 46-MW (compared
to 495 mw of the two thermal plants) steam turbine of the Damanhour power
station. The results indicate that temperature would increase from 37.3c
to 38c and is within requirements laid down in the Government standards.
Further studies would be carried out by the consultants, ESB Ireland during
the preconstruction phase to ensure that that the design of cooling water
inlet and outlet would conform to the standards laid down by the Government.
The consultants would incorporate in the design a waste water treatment
facility to ensure that the discharge from the treatment plant would meet the
Government standards (Para. 3.27).
3.29     With the additional generating capacity being installed every year,
it is appropriate that EEA has established an Environmental Coordinating
Committee to ensure compliance of the environmental standards of the country.
The details about the committee are given in Annex 3.5 (Para. 8).
3.30     To ensure proper functioning of the environmental activities of the
committee (Para 3.29) necessary technical assistance of about US$600,000 is
provided (including instruments and testing facilities) under component IV of
the project. The details of the items to be initially procured for
commencement of the activities of the committee are given in Annex 1.5 (Para
9). Assurance has been obtained from EEA that EEA procures the required
testing equipment to commence its project related environmental activities at
tne power station sites (components I and II) by June 30, 1991.
3.31     The proposed transmission lines (component III) generally follow the
existing transmission belt in the region and would have no adverse effect on
the environment. Possible adverse aesthetic effects would be kept to the
minimum by rerouting of the lines if necessary.
3.32     Satisfactory health, safety and emergency management measures will be
adopted under the proposed project by the borrower (See Para. 6 Annex 3.6).
3.33     In compliance with the Bank's policy no polychlorinated biphenyls be
used in any facilities funded under the proposed project.

IV. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
Accounting and Management lnformation Systems
4.01     The accounting and management information systems of EEA and EDCs are
reasonably satisfactory in comparison to utilities of similar size in other
developing countries. However, some deficiencies exist in such areas as cost
accounting and budgeting, property accounting, year end accruals of revenues
and expense- and management reporting. EEA has initiated actions to analyze,
redesign and better document its accounting and management information systems
as well as to train its acz-ountants, commercial and finance staff. These
activities are being carried out as part of the UNDP's Electricity and Energy
Data Bank Project (Project EGY/81/037) whose primary focus is to strengthen
the subsector's capacity to plan and manage the supply of electricity based on
accurate and timely data. The first phase of the project which included a
preliminary database design, computer hardware selection and procurement,
functional database design, detailed definition of economic and financial data
inputs as well as a preliminary assessment of the management information
system requirements of the subsector has been completed.
4.02     The second phase of the Energy Data Bank Project which is currently
underway includes a detailed feasibility study of the management information
system requirements of EEA, EEA Zones, EDA and EDCs, detailed systems analysis
and design and equipment specification. A prioritization of application
systems would be made so that during implementation priority will be accorded
to computerized financial and cost accounting system modules of the MIS.
Since EEA has obtained from other sources the required financing for
consultants services needed for the design and implementation phase,
acquisition of computer equipment and for training with manufacturers of
computer hardware and software, only a modest US$0.5 million is included in
this project to help EEA develop a detailed training program for its finance,
accounting and commercial staff and for implementing a part of the program.
Consultants services of about two man-months would be utilized to develop the
program. The balance of the remaining funds would be utilized to implement
high priority aspects of the training program.
Audt
4.03     Individual entity accounts of EEA and EDCs are audited by the
Government's Central Auditing Organization. The audits are comprehensive and
thorough although the timely completion and submission to the Bank of audited
consolidated accounts of the power subsector has been a problem, due mainly to
accounting problems in EDCs and sometimes due to reluctance by auditors to
issue an audit report on consolidated accounts of EEA and the EDCs. Under
Egyptian law, the auditors are required to audit the accounts of EEA and of
the EDCs and to issue separate audit reports. Accordingly, it has been agreed
that under this project EEA and EDCs would submit separate accounts and audit
reports. In addition, EEA would be required to submit to the Bank pro forma
consolidated accounts for EEA and the EDCs at the same time it submits the
separate accounts and audit reports. Delays in submitting audited
consolidated accounts should be reduced substantially when the actions to
improve the MIS (Para. 4.02) are taker,. Under ongoing loans, audited
0 S 6 911



- 31 -
accounts of EEA and EDCs should be received by the Bank within 6 months of the
end of each fiscal year. This provision would be retained under the proposed
loan.
Insurance
4.04     EEA insures, through a Government-owned insurance corporation to
cover business risks normally covered by the Government and public authorities
in Egypt, e.g., motor vehicles and stores and materials. It does not,
however, provide insurance coverage against certain business risks normally
covered by public utilities, e.g., fire and machinery breakdown. EEA
considers the two insurance options, market insurance and in-house insurance
(through creation of reserve funds) to be impracticable since the former would
involve substantial costs while the latter is not consistent with the
Government's regulations under the uniform accounting system. The Bank
recommended and EEA agreed that it would carry out a study to identify and
quantify the risks associated with its operations and to recommend the most
appropriate methods consistent with industry practice for minimizing and
managing such risks.
Past Financial Performance
4.05     Actual and projected income statements, balance sheets and sources

EEA's rate of return calculated on historic cost assets shows a moderate
improvement from 1.42 in 1984/85 to 5.0 in 1987/88. The rates of return for
the EDCs varied from 9.5% in 1984/85 to 3.62 in 1987/88. Other performance
measures, self-financing and debt/equity ratios indicate a decline in
performance since 1984/85 for EEA but satisfactory performance for EDCs. Thus
although the Eu;Cs rate of return of 3.62 in 1987/88 appears low, the
performance of the EDCs is satisfactory given the size of their investment
requirements. When compared to the subsector target rate of return of 5% p.a.
on revalued assets, the actual rates of return of 2.4% in 1983/84, negative in
1984/85, 1% in 1985/86 and 1.6% in 1987/88 indicate the need for improvement.
The lack of substantive improvement in financial performance in t-he last few
years is attributable to a doubling of fuel prices in 1985/86 and a further
66.5% increase in 1986/87 which outweighed an average tariff increase of 742
in the same period. The substantially better performance by EDCs compared to
EEA calls for a review of the transfer pricing policy within the subsector.
This review would be based on the results of the tariff study to be carried
out by EEA by 1990/91 (para. 2.18).
4.07     Collection of Accounts Receivable.  Tables 4.3 and 4.4 summarize the
subsector and EEA's accounts receivables collection performance respectively
during the years 1984/85 - 1987/88. The average collection period for EEA has
gradually increased from 2.9 months in 1984/85 to 4.9 months in 1987/88 and
that of the EDCs from 5.8 months to 6.9 months in the same period. These
increasing arrears have contributed to the subsector's liquidity problems and
reflect recent tariff increases. However, the current arrears of accounts
receivables represent a substantial improvement from 1979 when the arrears
represented 8 months sales. Also starting in fiscal year 1989, the Government
has started a practice of setting aside a budgetary provision to enable the
subsector to recover directly from the Ministry of Finance those public sector
balances which have become non-current.

Future Financial Performance
4.08     Although the current and recent past financial performance of the
power subsector is generally not adequate, future performance is expected to
improve substantially. The Government's declared policy of adjusting energy
prices to economic levels by 1994/95, its commitment to restructure EEA's
capital structure as well as other efficiency improvement measures (paras.
4.01 and 4.02) constitute an adequate basis for expecting improved financial
performance in he future.
4.09     Financial Targets.  During appraisal of the project, EEA and the Bank
agreed that a summary measure of EEA's financial performance would be the
internal cash generation ratio. Agreement has been reached on internal cash
generation targets of 20% in FY92, 30% in FY93 and 35% in FY94 and each year
thereafter. However, since internal cash generation targets are sensitive to
variations in investment expenditures, computation of these targets would be
based on a three year (current, prior and following year) moving average of
investment expenditures.  Fiscal years 1989/90 and 1990/91 would be an
adjustment period during which the Government plans to adjust energy prices in
0569M



- 35 -
a manner consistent with its objective of raising them to economic levels by
1994/95. The proposed financial targets therefore constitute an agreed
statement of objectives which are designed to improve the subsector's
financial performance over a reasonable period of time.
4.10     Financial Projections.  The detailed financial projections for EEA
(Annexes 4.1 thtuugh 4.3) and EDCs (Annexes 4.4 through 4.6) are prepared on
the basis of average electricity tariff increases of 30% in FY90 and FY91 and
average fuel price increases of 25% in both years. In FY92-95, all fuel
prices are assumed to increase in equal annual percentages needed to reach
economic cost in FY95. Thereafter they are assumed to increase at the rate of
inflation. In the same period the average electricity tariff is assumed to
increase at rates required to generate self-financing levels of 20% in FY92,
30% in FY93 and 35% in FY94 and each year thereafter. Although the tariff
increases assumed to take place in FY90-FY91 would not immediately transform
EEA into a financially sound utility, they represent a continuation since
1985/86 of the Government's efforts to move the power subsector to a better
system of management and to pricing policies which would increasingly provide
correct signals for sound investment decisions and would in due course require
customers to pay the full cost of goods and services provided to them.
Moreover, the magnitude of the increases is broadly the same as those which
have been implemented in 1985/86, 1986/87, and in 1988/89, and therefore t;.e
probability that they will be implemented is high. The Government also
recognizes that the transition from low prices (energy prices, and an
overvalued exchange rate) to economic levels would cause the power subsector
short-term financial difficulties and is considering different alternatives
for providing support to EEA including possibilities of increasing its equity
through debt/equity conversion or new capital injections (Para 4.08).
4.11     Financial Covenants.  Agreement has been reached with the
Government/EEA on internal cash generation targets for EEA of at least 20% in
FY92, 30% in FY93 and 35% in FY94 and each year thereafter, and on an annual
review of the financial position of EEA. Starting in FY90/91 (for FY91/92)
EEA would submit the results of its review to the Bank no later than six
months before the beginning of each fiscal year. On the basis of the review,
the Bank and EEA would agree on a plan of action for implementation in the
following year to ensure achievement of the financial targets.
4.12     Collection of Accounts Receivables.  The objective of maintaining
accounts receivables from final consumers of electricity at levels not
exceeding three months of sales would be continued under the proposed loan and
agreement to this effect has been reached. The Government recognizes that
given the anticipated frequency and magnitude of future tariff increases and
their consequent impact on consumers' finances, greater efforts would be
needed by it, EEA and EDCs to ensure achievement of the proposed targets. In
particular, the Government would ensure that public and large industrial
consumers settle their bills within the granted credit periods.
4.13     Debt Service Coverage.  During the annual consultations with the Bank
(para. 4.11) it would also be determined whether EEA's net internal cash
generation for the preceeding 12 months would amount to at least 1.5 times its
debt service requirements for the following yeRr taking into account any
expected new loans. Based on such a review EEA would be obliged not to
0S69M



- 36 -
contract new long-term debt without consulting the Bank unless its net cash
generation is expected to equal at least 1.5 times its debt service
requirements. The financial projections indicate that EEA's debt service
coverage ratio is expected to improve gradually to about 2.40 times in 1993/94.
4.14     Other Covenants.  EEA would be required to: (a) submit to the Bank
within 6 months of the end of each fiscal year its audited accounts and
audited accounts of all the EDCs together with the auditor's reports thereon,
as well as (Para 4.03! pro forma consolidated accounts of the subsector as a
whole; and (b) to carry out a tariff study to determine the economic costs of
supplying power to its consumers which would form the basis of policy
decisions on tarift structures and levels (Para 4.06).
Sources of Finance
4.15     EEA's investment program for FY88-FY96 totals about LE 31,328 million
of which LE 26,629 million or 85% represents foreign costs. The balance of
the investment program, LE 4,699 million or 15% in local currency costs would
be met from a combination of internal cash generation and local loans from the
Treasury and the National Investment Bank. The Internal cash generation would
contribute about 23% of the total investment program. The foreign currency
costs are expected to be financed from a combination of foreign loans,
suppliers credits, and grants. A summarized financing plan for the investment
program is shown below. The detailed financing plan is shown in Annex. 4.3.

V. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
Load Forecast
5.01     EEA's projected maximum demand for electricity for the period 1987-88
to 1996-97 is presented in Annex 2.5. Net generation and maximum demand are
projected to grow by an av,rage of 6% a year from 1987-88 to 1996-97. The
relatively conservative forecast used in this report is based on projections
of slow economic growth to 1991-92 and anticipated electricity price
increases, both of which would limit future electricity demand growth. The
proposed project will meet about 1,218 MW of incremental demand for
electricity and will help avoid current load sheddings.
Least Cost Analysis
5.02     The project forms part of EEA's least cost investment program for
meeting the projected requirements. Furthermore, the choice of the proposed
project is fully in line with a key Government objective of improving fuel
efficiency of power plants using natural gas. EEA through its consultants
executed studies to examine: (a) the feasibility of constructing three modules
of Damietta combined cycle totalling 1,080 MW, consisting of 720 MW of gas
turbines and 360 MW of steam turbines; and (b) the feasibility of converting
the open cycle plants at Damanhour and Mahmoudia to combined cycles for a net
addition of 3 x 46 MW. In 1985, Montreal Engineering Company, Ltd, Canada
prepared a "Lower Egypt Thermal Plant Study" to examine the prospects of
introducing combined cycle, simple cycle gas turbines and oil field steam
plants and concluded that the two module combined cycle project (720 MW) using
natural gas as the least cost solution. In 1989, EEA through its consultants
BecI'tel of USA examined the feasibility of adding a third module consisting of
240 MW gas turbine and 120 MW of steam turbine a total of 1,080 MW combined
cycle project. The Electricity Supply Board (1987) of Ireland prepared two
feasibility reports: "Damanhour Power Station; Conversion Cycle; Efficiency
Upgrading"; and Mahmoudia Power Station: conversion cycle: efficiency
upgrading in 1987. T'hese reports examined the feasibility of conversion of
Damanhour and Mahmoudia open cycle to combined cycle by adding 3 x 46 MW of
additional capacity and found that this would result in 62 percent improvement
in efficiency and benefits from fuel savings resulting in 29% rate of return
on investment of this component. The Bank has reviewed these studies and
agrees with the findings.
Return on Investment
5.03     Since the project components are part of Egypt's 1987-92 power system
expansion program, the Economic Rate of Return (ERR) was calculated on the
required power investment program for the incremental demand met by the
investment program.
5.04     The measurable costs include: (a) the capital cos* of ERA's expansion
program for 1987-92; (b) operating and maintenance costs; mid (c) the fuel
cost. The measurable benefits are the incremental revenue attributable to the
program based on average domestic tariffs. The electricity tariff rates are
assumed to increase in real terms by 15% p.a.
0s6sn

between 1990-1994. Thereafter, from 1994, the tariff rate is assumed to
increase by 8% p.a. (including 32 for fuel adjustment) during the life of the
project. The resulting rate of return is 10% (Annex 5.1). The low rate of
return is not a true measure of the economic worth of the project but reflects
the low electricity tariffs in Egypt and indicates that tariff levels are set
below the economic cost of the resources used to produce electricity, a result
of the system of subsidized prices for essential goods and services. In the
analysis the tariffs and, in turn, a major proportion of the benefits, are
based on domestic prices, while thie costs associated with the project,
including the price of fuel, are based on international prices. Since the
domestic prices are set below economic costs by the Government, the value of
the benefits attributed to the project is depressed, relative to economic
costs. If tariffs are set to reflect the full economic cost of supply, the
rate of return would increase to 17%. The economic benefits not included in
the: benefit stream are considerable. These include savings to the economy
through efficiency gains, progressive correction of distortion in electricity
tariff structure, longer term gain through improved planning and operational
efficiency, and, finally, benefits to the economy through reduction of costs
in the unserved energy and associated linkage effects of the project which
forms an integral component of the sectoral development and economic reform
program.
Riss
5.05     No risk that could be a potential problem for the physical
construction of the project is anticipated. Foreseeable construction risks
have been taken into consideration in the design of the project and in the
cost estimates. However, there are risks related to possible delays in
implementation of expected and agreed energy/electricity tariff adjustment by
the Government due viainly to socio-political reasons. Reconfirmation of GOE's
objectives has been obtained regarding energy/electricity tariff adjustments
indicated in this report towards reaching economic levels by 1995.

VI. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
6.01     During negotiations, the Government reconfirmed its policy to adjust
energy prices so as to reach their economic levels by June 1995 and to
exchange views with the Bank on annual adjustments consistent with that
objective (Para 1.15). Agreement was also reached with the Government and EEA
on the following:
(a)  EEA would submit to tht Rank by December 31, 1990, a plan for the
extension of load management measures to all Extra High, High and
Medium Voltage users, including peak load pricing and thereafter
implement the plan taking into account the Bank's comments
(Para.2.17);
(b) EEA would implement the training and the technical assistance
programs under the project (Paras. 3.06 and 4.02);
(c) EEA would operate a special account (revolving fund) for Bank loan
disbursement (Para. 3.18);
(d) EEA would employ engineering consultants throughout the project
implementation period for construction supervision (Paras. 3.24 and
3.25);
(e) EEA would maintain adequate records and reports necessary to monitor
the progress of the project and its evaluation would be submitted to
the Bank, semi-annual progress reports based on an outline to be
agreed with the Bank (Para. 3.26);
(f) EEA would establish an environmental coordinating committee to
implement by December 31, 1990, a program for pollution control
including the provision of necessary equipment and materials (Paras
3.29 and 3.30);
(g) EEA would submit to the Bank its audited accounts and also separate
audited accounts of EDCs and EDA together with pro-forma consolidated
accounts of the power subsector within six months of the end of each
fiscal year (Para.4.03);
(h) EEA would obtain Bank's prior consent to any further borrowing
whenever its internal cash generation is not sufficient to cover its
debt service at least 1.5 times in any future year;
(i) EEA would generate from internal sources funds equivalent to 20% and
30% of its expenditures (computed on a three-year moving average
basis) in FY92 and FY93 and 35% in each fiscal year thereafter; and;
0 569M1

(j) EEA and EDCs would reduce their accounts receivables, and maintain
them at levels not exceeding three months sales (Para. 4.12).
6.02     As a condition of effectiveness for the Bank loan:  The conclusion of
the EIB loan would be met (Paras. 3.08 and 3.09).
Recommendation
6.03     Subject to the foregoing, the project would be suitable for a Bank
loan of US$165 million equivalent for a term of 20 years including a grace
period of five years.

ANNEX 2.4
Page 3 of 3
The electricity demand projection fot the customer groups of the EEA
and the distribution companies is based on multiple regression on related
variables (econometric) and pure auto regression (Box-Jenkins) procedures.
The former method yielded better estimates in terms of values of explanatory
variables and statistical significance, key assumptions are as follows:
-    Based on the data from 19871/88 to 1996/97, the average
electricity/GDP elasticity is 1.46.
-    Industrial consumption was projected using an industrial
electricity/GDP elasticity of 0.88 from 1974/75 to 1987/88. In the period
under projection, demand for power in industrial sector is expected to grow at
a slower rate of 3.52 p.a. reflecting the impact of energy pricing, demand
management and conservation measures and industrial restructuring efforts.
-    To appreciate the significance of residential/commercial subsector,
the econometric approach of the demand projection accounts for more economic
and demographic variables than hitherto. At present, market saturation in
urban areas is apparent and owing to sluggish growth in the economy, the
electricity consumption among residential customers would be lower and is
expected to grow by 9.5X p.a. during the period of 1988/89-97 (Annex 2.4).
Furthermore, continuation of better control over power theft is expected to
reduce "waste" consumption in the commercial/residential groups.
-    Owing to the completion of most of the infrastructure development
projects by 1990 and absence of new large scale projects in the next 5-7
years, demand for electricity in public utilities is forecast to grow by a
modest 3.9% p.d. power demand by government subsector would be somewhat lower
in the next five years due to cuts in government expenditure as a part of
economic reforms, but would be higher in the later part of the projection
period.
-    Agricultural consumption was projected using a log linear equation
with an agriculture/GDP elasticity of 0.266.
-    Total sales were adjusted downwards through applying the effect of a
price elasticity of demand coupled with the recent tariff increases sufficient
to allow the real tariff level to rise three times higher in the next five
years. The impact of higher prices was assumed to occur after a mean lag of
1.5 years from the date of each price increase.
-    Network losses are expected to remain at between 14% to 15% with load
factor of 68.52 to 69.8%, over the period of 1988/89-97.

FOURTH POWER PROJECT
Project Description
A. Introduction
1.       The project consists of the following four components:
I.   Damietta combined cycle power station.
II.   Conversion to combined cycle of the existing industrial open
cycle combustion turbines at Mahmoudia and Damanhour power
stations.
III.   Transmission lines and substations.
IV.   Technical assistance.
B. Component I. Damietta Combined Cycle Power Station
2.       The power station consists of three combined cycle modules with a
nominal site rating of 1080 MW. Each module consists of two industrial
combustion turbines of 120 MW (nominal site rating) each and two Heat Recovery
Steam Generators (HRSGS), and one steam turbine of 120 MW capacity, associated
electro-me.hanical equipment, piping, and instrumentation and controls.  The
combustion turbine under International Standards Institute conditions has a
(15C and 1.013 bars) rating of 134 MW. The primary fuel for the combustion
turbines is natural gas from the Abu Maadi gas field and in case of
emergencies the combustion turbines could use distillate fuel oil (solar
oil). The combustion turbines are housed in an enclosed turbine hall. The
combustion products (at a temperature of about 520C) of the combustion
turbine exhausts into a duct which incorporates a damper to direct the flue
gases either into the Heat Recovery Steam Generator (HRSG) or up the bypass
stack into the atmosphere. The HRSG produces low (about 59 kg/cm2) and high
pressure (74 kg/cm2) steam which is used in the dual pressure steam turbine
to generate power. The power produced by the combustion turbines and steam
turbine generators is sent to the interconnected electrical system through the
220-kV switchyard. The switchyard is connected to the interconnected system
by two 220-kV double circuit transmission lines to Damietta town and Kasabi
substations. The third 220-kV transmission line, funded by IDB, would connect
the power station to Mahalla substation. The line is scheduled for
commissioning by 1992.
3.       At present four out of six combustion turbines have been commissioned
at the site and work in an open cycle mode. The combustion turbine thermal
efficiency (higher heating value) in the open cycle mode is expected to be
about 32% or 2,652 kcal/kwh generated. When the combustion turbine operates
in the combined cycle mode, the thermal efficiency is expected to be about 45b
or 1,900 kcal/kwh.

4.       The 220-kV switchyard is of indoor gas insulated type (GIS) and is
located adjacent to the power house. The switchyard design is based on one
and one-half breaker system.
5.       Natural gas is supplied by pipeline from the Abu Madi gas field (40
km) to the site at a pressure of 70 bars and reduced in the reducing station
to about 17 bars. The higher calorific value of the Abu Madi gas is
9,545 kcal/m3 (1.053 Nm3 of gas = 1 ton of fuel oil). In combined cycle
operations Im3 of gas would generate about 5 kwh of electricity. Hence for
6,000 hours of operation in combined cycle mode, the power station would
produce 6,480 Gwh of electricity requiring 1,296 x 10? m3 of natural
gas/year (or 3.55 x 106 m3/day for 1,080 MW).
6.       The housing colony for the plant operating stall and their families
is included in the project component.
7.       The major contracts for the component includes training program for
operation staff. The training would be provided onshore in EEA's training
schools, onshore at the plant site, offshore in the suppliers workshops, and
offshore in the utilities using similar equipment.
C. Component II. Mahmoudia and Damanhour Power Stations
8.       The Mahmoudia power station has four aero-derivative type combustion
turbines each with a nominal site rating of 50 MW and eight industrial type
combustion turbines each with a nominal site rating of 24 MW each; Damanhour
power Stahon has four industrial type combustion turbines with a nominal
rating of 24 MW each. These turbines meant for open cycle operation have a
thermal efficiency of about 26%. Due to low thermal efficiency, these
turbines were suitable for operation during the peak load period (less than
302 load factor) while more efficient turbines were allotted the base load
duties (about 602 load factor).  However, due to shortage of power, EEA
allocated base load duties to the industrial combustion turbines of Mahmoudia
and Damanhour power stations; the aero-derivative type combustion turbines of
Mahmoudia are, however, operated during peak load hours only due to poor
availability and difficulties of maintaining these turbines at site. Since
the shortage of installed capacity is likely to continue till the end of the
century, it was necessary to improve the efficiency of the industrial
combustion turbine at Mahmoudia and Damanhour power station so that they could
be economically utilized for the base load duties. Accordingly, a study
funded by the UNDP (Egy/85/003, Efficiency Upgrading of the Existing Power
Plants) was carried out by ESB, Ireland. The Bank was the executive agency
for the study which was completed in May 1987 and reviewed by the Bank. The
Bank agreed with the consultant's recommendation for conversion to combined
cycle operation of the 12 industrial combustion turbines at Mahmoudia and
Damanhour power stations.
9.       In combined cycle mode, the thermal efficiency of the plant is
expected to be 39% compared to 26% in the open cycle operation. Therefore,
for the same quantity of gas used, the combined cycle operation would generate
50% more electricity compared to the simple cycle operation. There would be
two combined cycle modules at Mahmoudia and one combined cycle module at



56 -                     Annex 3.1
Page 3 of 5
Damanhour power station. Each module would consist of four existing
industrial combustion turbines (24 MW each), four new HRSGS and one new steam
turbine (46 MW net output). Therefore, the conversion to combined cycle would
increase the net generation capacity by 92 MW and 46 MW at the Mahmoudia and
Damanhour power stations respectively. These "add-on" facilities could be
accommodated in the existing available land at the two power stations.
Housing facilities are already available at the two sites.
10.      The cooling water requirements are modest (5.68 m3/sec for
Mahmoudia and 2.84 m3/sec for Damarhour) and would be obtained from:
Mahmoudia canal (for Mahmoudia); and Khandak El Sharky canal for Damanhour.
The consultant, ESB carried out a model study for the cooling water systems at
Damanhour. The proposed design would meet the concerned standards laid down
by the Government. At Damanhour, there are three power stations located near
each other: the combustion turbine power station (the project component), the
195 MW thermal power station (existing) and the 300 MW thermal power station
(under construction). All the three power stations are located near the
conference of Khandak-El-Sharky and Mahmoudia Canal. Before commencing
construction of the 300 MW thermal power plant, ENEL, Italy carried out a
study (February 1988) on the hydrothermal impact on Mahmoudia and Khandak
Channels due to the construction of 300 MW power plant at Damanhour. The
study found that adequate cooling water was available and the maximum canal
temperature, due to operation of the 195 MW and 300 MW thermal plants, did not
exeeed 37.30 C. The cooling water requirements for the 4b MW "add-on" steam
turbine unit for the combined cycle represents only 10% of that needed by the
two thermal plants. A rough check by superimposing the cooling water
requirement of 46 MW steam turbine on those of the two thermal plants indicate
that there would be an additional temperature rise of 0.70C due to the 46 MW
steam turbine and the canal water temperature would not exceed 380C.  The
consultant, ESB found that the cooling water system is designed to meet the
standards of the Government (Law 48, 1982-Ministry of Irrigation). In
general, the air and water pollution standards of the Government are much
stricter than the Bank's.
11.      The HRSG's would be of single pressure type and would be designed for
quick starting of the combustion turbines. The temperature of exhaust gases
from the combustion turbine is 4900C at the exhaust gas flow rate of
120 kg/sec. The exhaust gases from HRSG would be discharged to the atmosphere
at about 170C. HRSG would produce steam at about 35 bars and 4500C; the
expected steam flow being about 13 kg/sec.
12.      Before commencement of construction work at Mahmaudia power station,
it is essential that the existing natural gas pipeline is relocated and the
gas compressors (not in use) removed since the high pressure gas supply is
already available to the power station. However, the gas supply at Damanhour
power station is tapped after the reducing station located in the nearby
thermal power station. Therefore, to feed the combustion turbine at proper
pressure, the gas has to be pushed through the gas compressors. This results
in high station auxiliary consumption of 2% at Damanhour compared to less than
1% at the Mahmoudia power station. The high station auxiliary consumption
could be avoided if a high pressure natural gas supply was tapped from the
neighboring thermal power station. EEA is aware of the problem and had

scheduled the activity of high pressure pipeline to be completed in 1987.
However, the activity should be completed before the project contractors start
work at site.
D. Components III. Transmission Lines and Substations
13.      The following transmission lines and substations are included in the
projt.,t component:
(a) Talkha - Mahalla - Tanta (60 km)
(b) Tanta - Tahrir 1 (50 km)
(c) Talkha - Zagzig (60 km)
(d) Mahmoudia - Mahalla (50 km)
(e)  Tanta - E. Baroud (50 km)
(f) Tahrir I - E. Baroud (15 km)
(g) Damanhour - E. Baroud (15 km)
(h) Faraskur - Mahalla (80 km)"'
'i) Faraskur 220-kV/66-kV substation (2x125 MVA transformers)
(j) El Boustan 220-kV/66-kV/ll-kV substation (2x125 MVA transformers)
14.      The transmission lines would assist in efficient transfer of
generation from Damietta, Mahmoudia and Damanhour power stations to the load
centers. The 220-kV/66-kV Faraskur substation would improve the voltage
condition of the 66-kV/1l-kV substations in the Damietta region. The
El Boustan 220-kv/66-kv substation is located in the land reclamation Boustan
project area. However, the nearest substations to the Boustan project area
are Sadat and Tahrir I. These two substances are fully loaded hence there is
an urgent need for establishment of the EL Boustan substation with 2x125 MVA
transformer capacity.
E. Component IV. Technical Assistance
15.      The component consists of the following:
(a) preconstruction and construction phase engineering consultancy
services for component I (Damietta);
(b) preconstruction and construction phase engineering consultancy
services for component II (Mahmoudia and Damanhour) and for
component III (if required);
(c) consultancy services, instruments, recorders and equipment
required for implementing the recommendations of the load
management and load research study (funded by the Bank under
Ln/Cr 1733/935 and Ln 1886-1-EGT);
1/ Except for the Faraskur-Mahalla line (funded by IDB) other lines and
substations are funded by the Bank.



Annex 3.1

(d) consultancy services, instruments and equipment for the tower
testing facility being established in the EEA's high voltage
testing laboratory in Cairo;
(e) consultancy services for providing training for EEA's staff;
(f) consultancy services and equipment for the Data Bank and MIS
activities being funded by UNDP (EGY/81/037); and
(g) conisultancy services, instruments and the equipment for the
environmental protection activities being undertaken by EEA.
16.      EEA had appointed OBI/EPS for the preconstruction phase consultancy
services for Component I (Damietta). OBI/EPS services are being continued for
the construction phase of the project component. It is estimated that about
1200 expert man-months of OBI and 600 man-months of EPS would be required for
both phases of the consultancy services. In case of preconstruction phase and
construction phase consultancy services for the component II, about 400 expert
man-months of services would be required to complete the job. As regards
Component III, EEA does not expect any need for consultancy services.
However, about 25 expert man-months of consultancy services have been provided
in the project for the component.
17.      About 50 expert man-months of consultancy services are provided for
implementation of the recommendation of the load management and load research
study, and for tower testing facilities. For training of EEA's staff, about
20 expert man-months of services are provided the balance being for overseas
training expenditure for the EEA's staff. For Data Bank and MIS system
activities, only supplemental assistance of about 10 expert man-months of
services is being provided since the ma ri funding for this activity is
provided by UNDP. In case of environmental protection activities of the
committee being established by EEA, about 10 expert man-month of consulting
services has been provided.
18.      In addition to the consultancy services (para 17), about US$400,000
have been provided for the load research equipment such as load recorders,
controllers, and computer hardware and software. An equal amount is provided
for the instruments and equipment required for the tower testing facilities.
For Data Bank and MIS activities, about US$400,000 have been provided for
computer hardware and software requirements, for the environmental activities
about US$400,000 have been provided for recording and measuring instruments,
and equipment.

General
2.       Records will be maintained giving planned and actual achievements, to
be reviewed annually or at agreed intervals for the following:
(a) installed and derated capacity in MW for each of the power
stations and according to types (such as hydro, thermal, diesel,
rombtistion tirbines);
(b) energy capabilities in MW GWh/year by each power station;
(c)  maximtumi demand in MW and units g-ierated in GWh by each power
station;
(d) station use in GWh by each power station;
(e)  fuel consumed in mt/m3 by fuel type and type of units in each
power station;
(f) sales in GWh to consumers and number of consumers according to
consumer categories;
(g) transmission and distribution (line) losses;
(h) planned and forced outages (by classification) in power stations
and in transmission and distribution network;
(i) monthly maximum demand in MW (gross) for the interconnected
system;
(j) quality of supply to the consumers (number of interruptions,
duration classified according to causes and voltage conditions
at the consumer end);
(k) annual system load duration curve for the interconnected system;
(1) plant and load factors and plant availability;
(m)  the results of the environmental monitoring of Damietta,
Mahmoudia and Damanhour power stations (6 monthly report);

(n) EEA's inv.ctment plan and annual budget by activity in local and
foreign costs.
Project Implementation
3.       Records will be maintained showing original schedule against actual
achievements and supplied to the Bank at agreed intervals on the fo"'owing
aspects:
(a) procurement action by bid packages (bid specifications, bid
invitation, opening of bids, bid evaluation, award of contract,
signing of contract and contract price as amended from time to
time);
(b) physical progress according to project components and contracts
(highlighting critical activities and bottlenecks);
(c) actual project costs and expenditures (local and foreign) and
estimated remaining expenditure (local and foreign) projected
quarterly through project completion;
(d) disbursement schedule (for the Bank loans and other loans);
(te) information on problems encountered during implementation
(including major mishaps) and expected impact on commissioning
schedules; and
(f) minutes of the meetings and progress reports of the consultants.

FOURTH POWER PROJECT
Environmenital Aspects
Site AcceptabilitY
1.       The Damietta combined cycle power station (component I) site was
found to be environmentally acceptable and no resettlement issues were
involved. As regards the Mahmoudia and Damanhour power stations (component
II), the available land at the two power stations is adequate for installing
the 'add-on' facilities for converting the existing open cycle industrial
type combustion turbines into combined cycle. The right of way for
transmission lines and the land for the two substations (component III) is
already available and no land acquisition issues are involved.
Egyptian Environmental Standards
2.       Egyptian air quality standards are much stricter than the World
Bank's. Egyptian standards will be used for completion of the final design of
the project.
Air Pollution
3.       The Damietta, Mahmoudia and Damanhour power stations are to be
primarily fired on gas, and only occasionally utilizing distillate fuel oil
("solar") with modest sulfur levels. Stack heights will be determined for
compliance of the emission standards.
4.       A monitoring station and a meteorological tower (similar to those
that exist at the Shoubrah-El-Kheima Power Plant) are included in the
project. An EEA employee will be given full-time responsibility to maintain
these instruments and collect data.
Water Pollution
5.       For Damietta combined cycle power station, condenser cooling waters
will be discharged into the Nile in accordance with the Egyptian temperature
standards. The manner in which cooling waters are returned to the Nile would
be such that it will have a minimal influence on: (i) local aquatic ecology;
and (ii) Damietta drinking water plant. To meet these objectives, a limited
ecological survey of the Nile in the vicinity of the proposed discharge is to
be conducted by EEA through its local consultants. All other wastewaters are
to be treated to meet the appropriate Egyptian standards prior to discharge
into drainage cana].s. A secondary wastewater treatment plant will be
installed for all domestic wastewaters. An American Petroleum Institute (API)
separator will be installed to treat oily wastewaters. A small laboratory and
sampling program will be established on-site for monitoring effluents and
ensulring compliance with standards. No cbromate chemicals will be used for
biocides and/or corrosion inhibitors. In the case of Mahmoudia and Damanhour

projects the condenser .tling watetr woult le discharged into the canals in
compliance with standards laid do%n hy "he Government.  For discharge of
wastewaters measures similar to that tor DItmietta would be taken.
Health, Safety and Emergency Mana&emeut
6.       All facilities supported under the proposed project will adopt: (a)
health and safety standards; and (b) a plan for emergency prevention,
planning, and management acceptable to the Bank.
7.       In compliance with the Bank's policy no polychlorinated biphenyls
will be used in any facilities funded under the proposed project.
Institutional
8.       Operation of all environmental control systems and monitoring program
at Damietta should be the responsibility of EEA. Currently, the EEA
environmental unit is located within the Studies and Research Group. Their
expertise lies wholly with air pollution. Water pollution is handled by the
Egyptian General Inspectorate for Control Laboratories. Under the project,
EEA has taken initiative to establish an Environmental Coordinating Committee
to review all aspects of any environmental issues and advise EEA's management.
9.       Staff fiom both the Studies and Research Group and the Control
Laboratory would also possess necessary skills for maintenance and simple
repair of environmental monitoring equipment through the proposed technical
assistance program.
10.      EEA has formed an Environmental Coordinating Committee to strengthen
its environment capability. The Committee will include representatives from
the current environmental unit (only concerned with air pollution), the
Central Laboratory (water pollution), and each Zone Office. The Committee
would ensure all company-related environmental activities are properly
addressed, designed and executed.
11.      To assist the Environmental Coordinating Committee in its activities
the following instruments would be funded under the project component:
meterorological tower; air quality monitoring station; software for
mathematical modelling of stack height to meet the country's air quality
standards; software for thermal plume modelling; and waste water package
treatment plant and an API separator.

LI Sales to final consumers (excluding sales to EOCs) are estimated to grow at 6.S p.a. on
average during FY88-FY96 mainly due to the predicted slowdown in economic performance which
is expected to reduce the growth rate of industrial demand substantially and resource
constraints which are expected to limit the rate of connection of new consumers.
LZ   Revenues from electricity sales (excluding internal transfers for EEA's sales to EDCs) are
based on average electricity tariff increases of about 31% p.a. during FY89 through FY96.
The financial projections assume that the FY89 increase of about 31% was implemented with
effect from April 1, 1989. Annual increases for FY90 and FY91 are assumed at 30% p.a.
Starting in FY92 the financial projections assume that tariff increases would be based on
self-financing levels for EEA of 20% in FY92. 30X in FY93 and 40% in FY94.

2.       Other Operating Revenues are estimated to grow at about 15% p.a. in
line with past experience.
3.       Fuel Expenses For the principal fuels, i.e. fuel oil, natural gas a.ad
diesel oil, fuel costs are based on consumption forecasts and sales growth
estimates prepared by EEA and the mission and on annual fuel price increases
of 25% in 1989/90 and 1990/91. For FY1991/92 through 1993/94 fuel prices are
assumed to increase in equal annual percentages needed to raise the prices to
international levels by FY94. The fuel price increases for FY95 and FY96 are
assumed to be at the rate of inflation.
4.       Salaries and Waxes are based on the subsector's salaries and wages
bill in FY88 and escalated at about 11% p.a. This is in accordance with the
Government's commitment to restrict public sector expenditures, as part of its
economic reform program.
5.       Materials and Services, and Administrative Expenses are assumed to
increase at 15% p.a.
6.       Depreciation is computed at an average annual rate of 3.1% of average
gross fixed assets in service during the year.
7.       Interest Expense Interest on all existing foreign loans has been
calculated on the basis of data on loan amounts, repayment terms and interest
rates, as provided by EEA. Interest on new loans is assumed at 9.0% for local
loans from the National Investment Bank and the Treasury. Interest added to
construction is calculated on an actual basis.
B. Balance Sheets
1.       Gross Fixed Assets in Service are valued on the historic cost
convention. Transfers from work-in-progress to fixed assets in service have
been determined on a detailed analysis of the subsector's investmeat program
and on estimated comkiletion dates of the assets to be acquired or constructed
in the period 1989/90 through 1995/96. Foreign exchange differences on
account of construction expenditures resulting from a loan revaluation
exercise at the end of FY88 amounting to about LE1.54 billion have been
included in fixed assets. These are written off over the life of the assets
or loan whichever is shorter.
2.       Inventories are estimated to increase at the same rate as the growth
in kWh sales.
3.       Accounts Receivables The forecasts assume receivables would be
collected faster than in the past and outstanding balances would improve
gradually to levels not exceeding 3 months' sales by 1991/92.
4.       Accruals represent about a half month's administration expenses and
wages and salaries, which is the normal outstanding liability at the year-end.

5.       Accounts Payable are assumed to represent 2 months worth of fuel and
material and services consumption.
6.       Other Accounts Payable are assumed to grow at the same rate as the
growth in construction expenditures.

Rate of Return Analysis
Introduction
1.       The calculation of the Economic Rate of Return (ERR) is based on the
costs and benefits associated with the time slice of Electricity Investment
Program covering the period of 1988/89-95 of which the proposed project is a
part.
Costs
2.       All costs are based on 1988 prices and calculated at official
exchange rate of LE2.4 per US$. Each components of costs are described below:
(a) Capital: Capital costs include generation, transmission and
distribution costs based on Egypt's electricity subsector investment
progrAm.
(b) Fuel: Fuel costs are based on average projected fuel consumption of
new plants in the investment program. Fuel costs were projected on
the basis of Bank's projections of international fuel prices till
1995. Beyond 1995, fuel price escalation is assumed at 3% per year.
(c)  Operation and Maintenance (O & M):  Operation and maintenance costs
were estimated at 3X of cumulative capital cost for generation,
transmission and distribution.
Benefits
3.       Benefits are based on incremental revenues valued at proposed annual
real increase in tariffs:

Economic Rate of Return
4.         The estimated ERR of 10% on base case reflects the fact that tariff
are lower than long-run marginal cost. The estimate of ERR is more a
reflection of the inadequacy of tariffs than of the economic merit of the
investment program. Accordingly, in the alternative case if the tariffs are
adjusted to reach LRMC by 1993-94 the ERR is about 17%.
Sensitivity Analysis
5.         Results of sensitivity analysis are shown below:
ERR
Base Case                                  10%
10% reduction in Revenue                  8.2%
20% reduction in revenue                  6.5%
5% increase in fuel price                6.0%
20% increase in Generation Investment   8.5%
