 ENERGY COMMUNITY OF SOUTH EAST EUROPE (ECSEE) APL3-BOSNIA
               AND HERZEGOVINA PROJECT
                  RESTRUCTURING PAPER

The Project was restructured on November 22, 2010 to extend the Closing Date and to
reallocate the proceeds of the Credit among various disbursement categories. A copy of
the restructuring paper (RP-1) is attached. This Restructuring Paper (RP-2) provides only
an update since the last two months. For project details please refer to the attached RP-1.


SUMMARY
The project is proposed to be restructured to allow EPHZHB to use savings of about SDR
110,000 for carrying out a study of solar energy potential in Herzegovina. EPHZHB is
one of the three implementing agencies for the project.

The project was restructured in November 2010 to extend the Closing Date to June 30,
2012 and reallocate the proceeds of IDA Credit among various disbursement categories.
The request for use of savings could not be processed in November 2010 since the Bank
had received a request only from EPHZHB but not from the Recipient, which has been
since received.


PROJECT STATUS
Given the implementation of various investments and activities, and further progress
since November 2010, the team reconfirms it assessment that the Project Development
Objective is expected to be achieved.

Project implementation continues to gain momentum. Procurement for the last remaining
component is on track. Since November 2010, the date of last restructuring, additional
8% of the Credit has been disbursed bringing the total disbursement to about 50%.
Overall the disbursement is in excess of the revised estimates.


PROPOSED CHANGES
   Components: EPHZHB has identified savings in the amount of about SDR 110,000
   from its TA component (Part B.2, Financial Management Information System) and
   proposes to use it to finance a study of potential for use of solar energy with the
   expectation that it would help promote investment in use of solar energy and assist
   Bosnia-Herzegovina to reduce the environmental impact of its thermal power
   stations. These savings are less than 0.5% of the Credit amount and represent very
   minor change. The proposed study is consistent with the Project Development
   Objectives and merits approval. Project implementation is satisfactory and in

                                            1
compliance with the Agreements for the Project. The savings have arisen due to part
payment of a contract (Financial Management Information System) through an earlier
project (Third Electric Power Reconstruction Project P058521). Procurement Plan
and the implementation schedule, provided in RP-1 remain unchanged.

 ENERGY COMMUNITY OF SOUTH EAST EUROPE (ECSEE) APL3-BOSNIA
               AND HERZEGOVINA PROJECT

                             RESTRUCTURING PAPER



SUMMARY
The project is proposed to be restructured to extend the closing date from December 31,
2010 to June 30, 2012; and reallocate the proceeds of the IDA Credit among various sub-
components within the overall Credit. EPBiH, EPRS, and EPHZHB are the implementing
agencies for the project.

These changes have become necessary for two reasons: Firstly to extend the Closing
date since the Credit effectiveness and fulfilling the conditions of disbursement by the
Recipient was delayed by 27 months, Secondly to ensure availability of adequate
financing for all the planned activities and investments. With almost all the procurement
completed (except for one sub-component for which bids are currently under evaluation)
the actual costs for each of the contracts and the disbursement category are known and
some reallocation is required.


PROJECT STATUS
The objective of the project is to facilitate BiH's participation in ECSEE through
investments to: (i) improve dam safety; (ii) reduce adverse environmental impacts at
thermal power stations; (iii) replace ageing existing facilities and equipment at
hydropower and thermal power stations; (iv) rehabilitate distribution systems and
introduce distribution Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems, (v)
establish a market operation system, (vi) provide hardware and software to improve the
financial management information systems of the Elektroprivredas; and through technical
assistance to facilitate project implementation, and determine the best way to reduce
sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions at a power plant.

Given the implementation of various investments and activities, the team has assessed
that the Project Development Objective is expected to be achieved. An environmental
improvement investment in a thermal power plant near Sarajevo has been commissioned,
a Financial Management Information System to improve management controls and
governance has been implemented by EPHZHB, and contracts have been signed for all
other investments except one.

Project implementation has gained momentum during the last one year and is
satisfactory. All the three implementing agencies have made good progress and
implementation is expected to further accelerate. Beginning October 2008 when the
                                           5
                                                                                         Annex 1
                                                                                      Page 6 of 12


project became effective, the implementing agencies have awarded contracts for SDR
23.1 million (93% of the Credit amount of SDR 25.1 million). Bids are currently under
evaluation for an amount of SDR 2.2 million (IDA finance of SDR 1.87 million).
Together with the contracts already awarded would add up to more than 99% of the
Credit amount under implementation.

Disbursement have also picked up and by the middle of November, an amount of
US$15.3 million (more than 40% of the Credit amount) had been disbursed. For the last
two quarters the disbursements have remained ahead of the revised disbursement
schedule and are expected to pick up further momentum since many contracts have been
signed within the last six months.

One component, i.e. the installation of air-filtering system in Kakanj thermal power plant
(Unit 5) has been commissioned. This is the first such installation in the Western Balkans
and has attracted media attention for adoption of modern technology by the EPBiH. It has
also been well received by the population around the power plant since it has resulted in a
significant improvement in air quality in and around Kakanj town.

A preceding project (Third Electric Power Reconstruction Project P058521) with the
same implementing agencies had piloted a Financial Management Information System to
improve management control, transparency, and efficiency of finance function within the
power utilities. Follow on financing was included in the current project. EPHZHB not
only piloted it successfully but expanded it through the enterprise. Seeing the benefits of
improved efficiency and management controls, the other two implementing agencies
(EPBiH and EPRS) are also implementing the pilots in their finance functions but would
like to scale it up through their enterprises. In the absence of additional financing from
the donors, the power companies have decided to scale it up with their own funds.



PROPOSED CHANGES

   ·   Components

   EPBiH would like to review the technical designs of wastewater treatment plant at
   Kakanj thermal power plant before investing since more modern technologies are
   now available than there were at Appraisal. The study would be completed by May
   2011, which would not leave enough time for installation and commissioning of the
   wastewater treatment plant before the proposed revised Closing date of June 30,
   2012. EPBiH has, therefore, decided to finance the engineering redesign study from
   IDA Credit proceeds and subsequent investment from its own resources.


   ·   Financing

·   Closing Date

The Closing Date for Bosnia and Herzegovina, Energy Community of Southeast
Europe (ECSEE) APL3-BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA PROJECT, (Credit No
4197 BOS) P090666 is proposed to be extended from 31 December 2010 until 30
June 2012. This will be the first extension of the project. The Closing Date needs to
be extended because the Credit effectiveness and fulfilling the conditions of
disbursement by the Recipient was delayed by 27 months on account of delay in
ratification by the Parliament and signing of subsidiary loan agreements.

An updated procurement plan and implementation schedule has been prepared and
the proposed extension is necessary to allow the ongoing works and technical
assistance to be completed (Annex 1). The implementing agencies have awarded
contracts for about 93% of the Credit amount within one and a half years of Credit
effectiveness, and for the remaining amount bid evaluation is in progress. Though the
                                        7

Credit effectiveness was delayed by 27 months, the Recipient has accelerated
implementation and is seeking only 18 months extension to complete the contracts.
The implementing agencies have already hired implementation consultants and have
in place organizational arrangements to supervise the contracts. Project Development
Objective is expected to be achieved.


·   Implementation Schedule

Because of the delay in Effectiveness, the implementation suffered the
consequential delays. However, the implementing agencies have made
up some of the lost time. Revised implementation schedules are:
