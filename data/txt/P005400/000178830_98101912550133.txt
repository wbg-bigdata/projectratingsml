I. INTRODUCTION
1.01     The proposed SSI-II project is in support of the Government's
basic objectives for industrial development in Morocco, which include
creating low-cost employment through support of small scale industries
(SSIs), fostering entrepreneurship and broadening the industrial base in
Morocco, and continuing technical assistance to and improving the incen-
tives for SSI.
1.02     The project would provide a loan to the Treasury of US$70 million,
r          of which at least $68.75 million would be on-lent to BNDE and commercial
banks with the objective of providing further assistance to small labor-
intensive industries. This loan will also include provisions for (a)
technical assistance to SSIs ($l.0 million) if continuation of present
funding by the EEC cannot be obtained and (b) consultants to help the SSI
Policy Making Unit of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry (MCI) to carry
out its program of studies ($0.25 million).
1.03     The SSI-II loan follows the Bank's first loan in this sector (Loan
1687-MOR, US$25 million), which was fully committed well ahead of schedule
within one year after it became effective in December 1979. The Banque
Nationale pour le Developpement Economique (BNDE) will play a central role
as the administrator and beneficiary of part of the loan. The same insti-
tutional mechanisms and procedures provided under the first SSI loan,
including the SSI sub-loan guarantee system through the Government owned
and operated Caisse Centrale de Garantie (CCG), shall be retained under
this project considering that they have worked smoothly and successfully as
demonstrated by the speedy commitment of the SSI-I loan.
1.04     As the first SSI loan to Morocco has not yet been fully disbursed,
no Project Performance Audit Report is available. However, the experience
gained so far from the first SSI loan has been reflected in SSI-II; in
particular, the allocation of the loan to different SSI groups (para.
6.07), and the policy and technical assistance to be provided (paras. 4.08
and 4.11).
II. THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR
A. Performance and Constraints
Performance
2.01     In order to redress a rapidly deteriorating external financial
situation, the Government initiated an interim Austerity Plan (1978-80).
The Plan curtailed the growth of large capital intensive industries and
developed an industrial policy more adapted to the conditions and limited
resources of the country: continuation of economically justified long-term
investments (cement and sugar for local market; phosphoric acid for
exports); development of the manufacture of intermediate and capital goods;
strenathening of the industrial exports policy; industrial decentraliza-
tion; and the promotion of SSI for employment creation. At the same time



- 2 -
the Government reassessed its industrial development strategy, which
previously had been based on investments in large, capital intensive and
mainly public sector enterprises, and on a policy of import substitution
for consumer and intermediate products. Investments decreased substan-
tially in that period, imports of manufactured goods (mainly intermediates
and capital goods) dropped by 15% in volume in 1978-79; the growth of
manufacturing slowed down from 8.8% p.a. during 1975-77 to 4.5% p.a. in
1978-79. In 1980, the ec6nomic climate improved. Exports of manufactured
goods increased in volume at about 17% p.a. in 1980, as compared with 10%
p.a. during 1973-77, contributing to a reduction in the deficit of the
balance of payments from 17% of GDP in 1977 to an estimated 8% in 1980.
Textiles and chemicals emerged as significant export industries with food
processing, which has traditionally exported about 7% of its production;
these three sectors account for about 90% of manufacturing exports. The
share of manufactured exports in total exports increased as a result from
23.6% in 1975 to 38.5% in 1979. The export potential for manufactured
goods will be more fully developed under the new 1981-85 Plan (para. 2.04).
Constraints
2.02     There are several constraints that limit the possibilities of
growth of the manufacturing sector: the balance of payments deficit
remains substantial, and limits increases in imports of equipment and raw
materials for industry resulting in under-utilization of capacity; the
pervasive lack of well-trained technicians and foremen in manufacturing;
and the current incentive system (para. 2.09).
2.03     Foreign investments have been limited as a result of the "moroc-
conization" policy introduced in the early 70's, administrative delays, and
the shortage of skilled labor, even though guarantees are provided for the
transfer of dividends and the repatriation of capital. The incentives of
the Investment Code (duty exemptions on imported equipment, 2% interest
rebates on long and medium term BNDE loans to manufacturing, and income tax
exemptions) have not encouraged industrial enterprises to select labor
intensive processes, and the exports incentives (tax exemptions on import
generated profits, and lower interest rates on short-term export credits)
have been insufficient to offset the negative impact of protection on the
price of local inputs and on the relatively higher profitability of the
domestic market.
B. The 1981-85 Plan
2.04     General Objectives and Strategy.  A rapid rate of population
growth (over 3% p.a.) and a high level of unemployment (9.7% in 1980)
require an acceleration of the growth of output and employment. The Plan
targets a GDP growth of about 6.5% annually, which would allow an annual
increase in consumption of about 2.5% per capita in real terms and an
annual growth of employment of 3.7%, i.e. slightly more than the projected



3.3% annual growth of the labor force during the period. To achieve these
objectives while overcoming the severe foreign exchange and savings
constraints of the past few years, the Plan emphasizes export-oriented
growth with a projected real growth of exports of 8.5% p.a., and a major
domestic savings effort. However, the large volume of investments, esti-
mated at DH 110 billion in 1981 prices, to support this strategy means that
external financing requirements will remain substantial over the 1981-85
period.
2.05     The Industrial Sector.  Industrial investment is projected to
total DH 20.9 billion (19% of total investments) during 1981-85 and
generate a growth rate of 8.4% p.a. in industrial value added increasing
industrial employment by 5.3% p.a. The increase of industrial exports is
the first priority; without such exports Morocco could not continue
importing the raw materials and equipment goods it needs without further
destabilizing its balance of payments. Investments in exportoriented
projects would total about DH 11.6 billion, of which DH 10.7 million are
for large projects for phosphate derivatives in which Morocco has a marked
competitive advantage. Exports of industrial products are projected to
grow by 13.3% p.a. and their share in total exports should continue rising,
reaching 45% by 1985 compared to 38.5% in 1979.
2.06     The other major objectives for industry in the new Plan are (i)
the promotion of labor intensive small and medium scale industries (12% of
total industrial investment or DH 2.6 billion); and (ii) the selective
development of engineering industries (15% of total industrial investments
or DH 3.1 billion).
2.07     Bank Support.  The Bank supports the Plan's objectives and would,
through a ninth loan to BNDE and its sector work,help the Government reach
these objectives. The recent review of the engineering industries by the
Bank 1/ should help to develop this subsector where imports represented 60%
of total manufacturing imports in 1977. In addition, a number of measures
will be taken to strengthen exports and to reform the incentive system for
industry.
2.08     The recently created Centre Marocain de Promotion des Exportations
(CMPE), assisted by the International Trade Center (ITC) in Geneva, is
becoming the central institution for tne promotion and the development of
exports. ITC has proposed a 3-year (1982-84) assistance program to CMPE to
be financed by UNDP.
2.09     A revision of the incentives system (Protection, Investment and
Export Codes) will be undertaken by the Government after a series of
studies to assess the current system and to recommend appropriate changes
are completed by the end of the year; these studies, supported by the Bank,
have been in progress since 1979. Government recommendations for reformu-
lating the structure of protection and of the incentive codes are expected
1/ Morocco-Review of the Engineering Industries - February 2, 1981.



in the first quarter of 1982 and the promulgation of a new Export and
Investment Code is scheduled for the end of 1982, while completion of a
gradual reform of the protection structure and tariffs is envisaged by
mid-1983. The new Codes are expected to reduce administrative delays,
and the various biases that exist presently between sectors and between
firms. They are also expected to offer more effective incentives to
foreign investors to award sub-contracting contracts to Moroccan firms, and
encourage transfers of technology particularly needed by the engineering
industries.
III. THE FINANCIAL SECTOR
3.01     Morocco has a well-developed financial sector.  It consists of
fifteen commercial banks, five specialized institutions, and two savings
banks, which are controlled by the Banque du Maroc (BdM), Morocco's Central
Bank. Medium- and long-term financing is provided to private investors
mainly by three of the specialized institutions: the agricultural credit
bank (CNCA), the housing and tourism bank (CIH), and the industrial bank
(BNDE), all of which have received Bank loans. There is also a capital
market at the Casablanca stock exchange where shares of private companies
are listed and traded, but its role is limited (less than 300,000 shares
traded in 1979) and has been declining (volume of shares traded declined by
75% between 1975 and 1979).
A. The 1978-1980 Stabilization Program
3.02     Late in 1977, the Government recognized the need to bring public
consumption, investment, and imports under control to avoid a liquidity
crisis. To restore the balance between investment and savings, several
deflationary measures were taken in 1978. Public capital expenditures were
curtailed by limiting Government reliance on both Central Bank advances and
foreign loans with maturities of less than ten years; short-term credit by
commercial banks to the private sector was tightened; and interest rates on
time deposits were increased to stimulate domestic savings, the low level
of which is a serious weakness of the Moroccan economy.
3.03     As a result of these actions and other austerity measures, the
Moroccan economy entered a recession cycle. The industrial production
index did not rise between 1978 and 1979, and capital expenditures declined
(in current prices) by 27% in 1978 and 13% in 1979. Preliminary data for
1980 seem to indicate, however, a turnaround in both production and invest-
ment trends in the manufacturing industry.
3.04     To curb inflationary pressures, the Government limited the growth
of short-term credits to 10% in 1979, but freed the growth of rediscount-
able medium-term credits and of loans to exporters. The results did not
meet the Government's expectations, because short-term credits granted by



the banking system increased by 13% in 1979 while medium-term credits
decreased by 2%; the same undesirable pattern, but more pronounced, was
observed during the first ten months of 1980. The credit squeeze worsened
the traditional poor liquidity of the Moroccan commercial banks, leading
them to rely considerably more on the Central Bank rediscount and on the
interbank short-term money market, where interest rate reached 10.5% in
late 1979. This situation did not ease in 1980 and, for the first time
since 1975, the Central Bank raised its basic rediscount rate, from 4.5%
to 6%.
B. Interest Rates and Cost of Capital
3.05     The Government determines interest rate ceilings on both deposits
received and loans granted by financial institutions in Morocco. The
interest rate structure was overhauled on October 1, 1980 in consultation
with the IMF; the new structure is detailed in Annex 1. Interest rates
were increased on the average by one-half percent on term deposits to
attract more savings, and lending rates were also raised by 1-2% because of
higher inflation and increased cost of borrowing for financial institutions
(para. 3.07). This followed a previous raise in interest rates on term
deposits in mid-1978. Term deposits increased by 36% in 1978 and 24% in
1979, and the share of deposits maturing beyond four months in the total
rose from 61% in 1977 to 65% in 1979. The recent restructuring is expected
to continue this trend.
3.06     Cost of Resources.  The cost to the commercial banks of local
currency resources varies widely depending on their maturity: sight depo-
sits yield no interest, except for Moroccan workers abroad on repatriated
savings (3% p.a.), and insurance companies (4% p.a.); short-term deposits
yield from 4% p.a. for one-month deposits to 9% for eighteen-month depo-
sits, and there is no ceiling for deposits maturing beyond eighteen
months. The cost of rediscount facilities at the BdM ranges from 3.5% for
commercial paper for agriculture to 5% for medium-term paper, while the
basic rediscount rate is 6%. Local currency bonds carry interest rates up
to 10% p.a. and can be issued only by specialized financial institutions
(CIH, BNDE, CNCA) and large public enterprises. The cost of directly
contracted foreign exchange resources is not regulated by the Government
and thus reflects international rates, although the Government influences
the choice of borrowed currencies for financial intermediaries, and
indirectly their cost, because it bears the exchange risk.
3.07     Lending Rates.  For the first time since 1975, lending rates were
raised across the board.  The maximum rates charged by commercial banks on
rediscountable loans were increased from 8% to 9% p.a. for short-term
loans, and from 8% to 10% p.a. for medium-term loans. BNDE, the major
source of industrial financing, is now charging a single rate (12% p.a.) on
all its loans regardless of maturity, instead of 10% for medium-term loans
and 11% for long-term loans as was the case until October 1980.



- 6 -
3.08     Effective Cost of Borrowing.  The effective cost of capital for
industrial borrowers is, however, 10% p.a. regardless of maturity. This is
because industrial projects approved under the 1973 Investment Code are
eligible for a 2% interest rate rebate. The same would apply to any
Bank-financed SSI subloans with a maturity of more than seven years.
3.09     Interest rates have been positive in real terms in most recent
years and are expected to remain positive given projected inflation rates.
Inflation remained moderate through 1976 because of an array of price
controls and subsidies, which shielded domestic prices against rapid
changes in international price levels. Inflationary pressures, however,
developed in 1977 and prices as measured by the cost-of-living index rose
12.5%. Austerity measures imposed in 1978 slowed down the inflation rate
to 9.7% in 1978, 8.3% in 1979, and 9.4% in 1980. For SSI, the onlending
rates will be 10% p.a. for subloans up to seven years, and 12% p.a. for
subloans over seven years but with a 2% interest rate rebate which brings
the effective interest to 10% p.a. as well; this corresponds to the rates
on rediscountable medium-term credits and on BNDE's long-term loans respec-
tively. The same principle was applied under the first SSI loan, where the
demand for SSI subloans remained at a high level. Over the commitment life
of the proposed loan (1981 through 1983), the interest rate will be posi-
tive compared with projected inflation rates of 8-9% p.a.
C. Financial Intermediaries for Financing Industry
3.10     The Commercial Banks.  At the end of October 1980, Morocco's
fifteen commercial banks had total assets of DE 20.5 billion ($4.1 bil-
lion). The degree of concentration is high: two banks (BCP and BMCE)
accounted for 44% of total assets at the end of 1979, and five other banks
(BCM, BMCI, CDM, SGMB, and CMCB) accounted for another 43%. The banking
network totalled 543 branches at the end of 1979, but its geographical
distribution is uneven because 25% of all branches are located in Casa-
blanca and another 50% in cities along the Atlantic coast.
3.11     Moroccan law requires that commercial banks be at least 50%
Moroccan-owned, and this has led to the Government taking major partic-
ipations in the largest banks. They appear, nevertheless, to be free of
major Government interference and they are efficiently and profitably run.
As Table 3.01 indicates, commercial bank lending is predominantly short-
term. Transformation of deposits into medium-term credits is low and has
been steadily declining, from 7.1% to 5.5% between the end of 1978 and
October 1980. The main reason for this situation is the relatively high
spread of 7.5% the commercial banks enjoy on their short-term lending,
compared to the spread of only 1% on medium-term credits financed with term
deposits.



- 7 -
3.12     Financial intermediaries are responsible for the bulk of medium-
and long-term credits to the economy, and had granted 84% of outstanding
loans at the end of 1979, compared to 16% by the commercial banks. Finan-
cial intermediaries are specialized by sector of activity. CNCA lends
primarily to agriculture and to agro-business operations 1/, CIR lends to
tourism projects and housing 2/, and CDG is a Government institution in
charge of public fund management (e.g., pension and insurance funds, postal
savings, etc.). BNDE plays a key role in financing capital expenditures of
the Moroccan industry.

3.13     Financing of industrial investment takes various forms, from
medium- and long-term credits granted by commercial banks and BNDE, to
supplier credits from abroad, leasing, and equity participation. There

are no data on supplier credits. Although discussions with industrial
promoters showed that these credits are available, the exchange risk
involved is often a deterrent. Banks, such as BMCI, offer 3-year loans
limited to the financing of equipment; processing delays are short, but the
cost is higher than medium-term credits. Leasing, introduced in 1965, is
offered by three institutions (Maroc-Leasing, Maghrebail, Credico), but its
impact is still marginal with financing peaking at DH 121 million in 1977.
Equity participations are taken occasionally by the banks and BNDE, but
there is no company specializing in venture capital although the idea is
under consideration. There are also less orthodox forms of financing such
as short-term credits to promoters to help them raise the necessary equity,
and short-term revolving credits to allow banks a greater spread than on
straight medium-term loans; the extent of such practices is not known.
IV. SMALL SCALE INDUSTRIES (SSI)
A. Definitions
4.01     Generally in line with the eligibility criteria used under SSI-I
project (Loan 1687-MOR), SSIs are currently defined as enterprises having
(i) a total project cost (new SSIs), or total net assets after expansion,
of less than DH 5 million ($1 million) excluding land but including build-
ing cost and permanent working capital needs, and (ii) an investment cost
per job created of less than DH 40,000 to 50,000 ($8,000-10,000) depending
on location and type of industry. Special emphasis is placed on the
smaller of these industries, which are those with total net assets after
the investment project of less than DH 2.5 million ($500,000). Because
firms in the target group will generally employ between 5 and 50 workers,
the characteristics of the SSI can be identified with those of the 5-49
workers segment covered by the latest published industrial survey (1977).
B. Characteristics and Performance
4.02     Estimates from the 1977 Industrial Survey show that about 3,160
SSIs employed some 42,100 people, representing 74% of all industrial estab-
lishments and 20% of manufacturing employment. About two-thirds of all
SSI establishments are concentrated in the three largest urban areas
(Casablanca, Fez and Marrakech).  The very small enterprises, or handi-
crafts, with less than five employees are more scattered in rural areas
because they tend to specialize in supplying local markets. A detailed
study of handicraft has not been undertaken. Handicrafts will be eligible
for financing under the SSI scheme, but as a separate scheme to finance
handicrafts is already in operation and offers very favorable terms, any
handicraft financing under the SSI scheme is expected to be negligible.



4.03     Two sub-sectors dominate SSI activities:  food industries and
textiles/leather. In 1977 together they represented 56% of employment,
55% of SSI total value added, 95% of total SSI exports, and 59% of SSI
investments. Table 4.01 shows that small scale food industries (canned
fruits and vegetables, and olive oil mainly) contributed to almost half of
all exports by the food processing sector in 1977, demonstrating a strong
capacity to export. SSIs play a substantial role in food processing,
mechanical/electrical industries, construction materials, and the wood and
furniture industries, in particular by supplying local markets where they
take advantages of transport economics (e.g. brick, tiles, furniture,
etc.); SSIs in textiles/leather have a strong potential for employment
creation with 34% of total labor force, but contribute little to exports.
This is due to several reasons:  (i) local demand is scattered in small
towns and rural areas where SSIs can easily use their advantage of
proximity to consumers; (ii) the SSIs have difficulty in coping with the
quality and delivery requirements of foreign buyers; and (iii) there is no
adequate organization in Morocco able to assist SSIs in exporting.
4.04      In future, export opportunities could develop by large foreign
companies sub-contracting production to SSIs and, in the process, providing
technical assistance. Some recent promising examples of such subcontract-
ing arrangements with large European firms have been for automotive and
electronic components. Further studies by the Policy-Making Unit and CMPE
to identify the subsectors most promising for such arrangements, as well as
possible promoters, will be undertaken.

4.05     Until the mid-seventies, little attention was given to SSI in
terms of economic policy. Morocco's industrial development strategy in
the last decade gave priority to large public enterprises. Despite this
SSIs contributed significantly to industrial development during the 1969-77
period as shown in Table 4.02. SSI represented about 19% of industrial
value-added by 1977. Between 1969 and 1977, labor productivity of total
manufacturing (measured by the value added per worker) was greater in
larger enterprises than in small ones because of economies of scale exist-
ing in most sub-sectors; however, it increased faster in SSI, thus indicat-
ing a potential competitive edge of some SSIs vis-a-vis large firms in some
subsectors. In 1977, value added per worker in textiles/leather, and more
significantly in food industries, was greater in SSI than in large enter-
prises.

C. Institutional Framework for SSI
4.06     As a result of the dialogue between the Government and the Bank
during the preparation of the SSI-I project, the Government set up two
units to address the specific needs and problems of SSIs: the PolicyMaking
Unit, and the Technical Assistance Unit (TAU).
4.07     The Policy-Making Unit was established under the supervision of
the Director of Industry in the Ministry of Industry and Commerce in
October 1978. In the last two years, the Unit, staffed with two full-time



- 11 -
professionals, has completed two studies on the characteristics and impor-
tance of SSIs in Morocco and another one on promotion of SSI development in
general (in the area of fiscal and credit policy, custom regulations, pro-
curement), and participated in several promotional seminars. The Unit made
a few policy recommendations which were incorporated in the 1981-85 Plan
(e.g., to broaden access to public contracts for SSI, to ease the import
licensing system, to encourage sub-contracting, and to give SSI priority in
industrial zones). The already completed studies, contributed to raising
general consciousness about the key role and specific needs of SSIs, but
failed to either formulate strategy guidelines for SSI development or
propose basic policy changes. This is due to the insufficient staffing of
the Unit as well as its limited influence on policy making. During 1981,
the Unit plans to conduct a survey of about 250 SSIs to identify specific
problems and requirements of small entrepreneurs, and these data will be
reviewed by Bank supervision missions.
4.08     The work and guidance of the Unit could be enhanced by strengthen-
ing its staff and by closer supervision of the Unit by the Technical
Committee. The Technical Committee, made up of representatives from the
Ministry of Finance, BdM, ODI, the Ministry of Industry, and BNDE, reviews
and approves SSI subprojects proposed for Bank financing. The Technical
Committee has the right (not exercised thus far) to propose specific policy
and administrative measures to be studied by the Unit to remedy the draw-
backs mentioned above, and to follow-up their implementation; to increase
the effectiveness of the Technical Committee, a permanent secretariat will
be established. The Moroccan authorities recognize that SSIs do not fit
well into the existing standard incentive scheme to industry, which is
mainly oriented towards large scale modern enterprises. To remedy this
situation, a major review of the Industrial Investment Code is scheduled
for 1982 on the basis of sectoral preparatory work, being undertaken with
Bank assistance. Incentives specific to SSIs could thus be introduced.
The Unit should also investigate promotion of subcontracting between small
and larger enterprises, involvement of SSIs in carrying out public con-
tracts, quality control of products, and marketing especially for exports.
A program of work for these undertakings has been identified during nego-
tiations, and financing for foreign experts will be provided under the loan
of up to $0.25 million to review in detail the existing policy and incen-
tive systems relating to SSI, and to make recommendations on how this
should be changed to foster efficient SSI development (includes provision
for up to 18 man months of consultants time at $10,000 per man month). The
terms of reference for any consultants will have to be approved by the
Bank, and supervision missions will monitor the progress and review the
results of any studies undertaken.
4.09     Technical Assistance Unit (TAU).  The delivery of technical
assistance to SSI promoters, in the form of extension services, was a key
component of the first SSI project. The TAU was established in November
1978 and is part of ODI, a Government agency established in 1973 to promote
industrial development in Morocco through sectoral studies, general
promotional activities in Morocco and abroad, and direct Government



- 12 -
participations in large projects. The TAU is adequately staffed with seven
professionals, while a further two are being recruited; in addition, four
foreign experts joined TAU in 1980. The terms of reference for the TAU, as
agreed with the Bank, call for activities in the following fields;
(a)  Identification and preparation of SSI projects in coordination
with banks and the Ministry of Industry.
(b)  Technical advice to small entrepreneurs in the selection and
procurement of equipment and in preparing their requests for
financing.
(c)  Assistance in project implementation and in solving infrastructure
and administrative bottlenecks.
(d)  Basic assistance to small enterprises in identifying and solving
management and production problems.
(e)  Assistance, in cooperation with banks, in identifying and solving
accounting and financial deficiencies in operating SSIs.
(f)  Assistance in locating marketing outlets and/or subcontracting
arrangements in local or foreign markets.
4.10     When four foreign experts on SSI financed by an EEC grant arrived
in June 1980, they were able to start quickly on a program which had been
prepared by the Moroccan staff of the TAU. In three months, they had
visited, diagnosed, and started to provide assistance in production and
general management to 37 SSIs, 27 of which were Bank-financed subprojects.
Because the extension service has been in operation for less than a year,
an in-depth evaluation would be premature. However, the support provided
to the SSIs assisted by the TAU is both adequate and well received by the
promoters. In the future, increased emphasis will be given to assisting
with the selection of equipment and appropriate technology.
4.11     The TAU's medium-range objective is to cover progressively all the
activities included in the terms of reference set at its inception (para.
4.09). In particular, early attention will be given to the following two
activities. First, a data bank of market, technical, and financial data
concerning SSIs will be set up to help SSI promoters identify investment
opportunities, and a comprehensive analysis of administrative procedures
specific to SSI will be undertaken to assist promoters with the problems
encountered during project processing (para. 4.09(b) and (c)). Second, the
TAU is planning to offer seminars on elementary accounting principles,
general management principles, and on other subjects suited for group
teaching (para. 4.09(e)).
4.12     The financing of the TAU program is assured through June 1982 with
an EEC grant. It is expected that by mid-1981 the EEC Commission will have
taken a decision on a possible renewal of this grant for another 2 years.



- 13 -
If an EEC commitment is not obtained, ODI has requested financing by the
Bank. The needs are estimated at $1 million over two years to cover the
foreign currency costs of four experts 1/, participation in promotional
campaigns abroad, search for export-market opportunities, etc. Considering
the crucial role of the technical assistance component, up to $1 million
will be allocated out of the SSI-II loan for covering the foreign exchange
cost of the technical assistance program sponsored by ODI over the period
July 1982-June 1984. If alternative sources of financing for this com-
ponent are obtained, the funds would be reallocated for use under the
credit line.
D. Existing Mechanisms for Lending to SSI
4.13     The Accelerated Procedure (PSA).  The PSA is a simplified proce-
dure which allows commercial banks to rediscount loans to SSI with the BdM
without the detailed review by BNDE required for other rediscounted loans
in the industrial sector. PSA loan approvals have increased from DH 5.6
million for 63 projects in 1973 to a peak of DH 125.2 million for 187 proj-
ects in 1977; during the first half of 1980, DH 22 million of loans were
approved for 76 projects. The PSA procedure has some drawbacks. It has
sometimes taken 3-6 months between appraisal and disbursement; eligibility
criteria are also a constraint because annual turnover and total assets,
after the project, must not exceed DH 7.5 million and DH 5 million respec-
tively; a minimum of 40% equity is also required from the promoters, and
PSA loans are limited to DH 1 million per firm. As a result, the PSA has
served only a limited number of SSIs.
4.14     The SSI Pilot-Line.  The Pilot Line extended by the Bank in con-
junction with the eight loan to BNDE (1428-MOR) in 1977 was designed to
help remedy some of the PSA shortcoming, to improve knowledge of the sub-
sector, and to draw lessons from the experience acquired 2/.  The $5 mil-
lion allocated for this purpose were shared between BCP (§3 million) and
BNDE ($2 million).  Forty-one subproject were financed, representing DH 44
million of project investments with 1,700 jobs to be created at an average
cost of DH 26,000 ($5,200). BCP lent mainly to the smaller SSIs, while
BNDE's subprojects were somewhat larger and less labor intensive; the
respective average investment cost Der job created were DH 21,200 ($4,240)
for BCP and DH 40,700 ($8,140) for BNDE. At the time of appraisal of the
current project, only a limited number of subprojects were operational
because of delays in organizing the new firms and getting delivery of the
1/ 96 man-months, at $8,600 per man-month, for the period mid 1982-mid
1984.

equipment ordered 1/. Disbursements amounted to 66% of total commitments
under the Pilot Line as of June 1, 1981.
4.15     The SSI-I Line of Credit.  Recognizing the economic and social
importance of promoting the growth of SSIs, the relative scarcity of
financing available to them, and the shortcomings of the current system of
institutional support and technical assistance for SSI promoters, the
Government decided in 1978 to launch a comprehensive program of assistance
to SSIs. The SSI-I project (Loan 1687-MOR) was designed to support this
Government effort by providing financial and technical assistance to SSI
promoters 2/.
4.16     Under this project, SSI-I funds were to be channelled through the
whole commercial banking system and BNDE, rather than only through BCP and
BNDE as under the Pilot Line. The loan amount was set conservatively at
$25 million. Commitments were projected to occur over approximately two
years; however, only fifteen months after the loan became effective, 91% of
the loan was committed (33% disbursed) for 196 subprojects (textiles and
leather 21%; electrical/mechanical 14%; chemicals and construction 22%;
food processing 17%; miscellaneous 26%). Several factors explain the rapid
commitment of the loan. First, the terms of subloans were attractive com-
pared to other financing means and banks advertised them extensively in
newspapers and on TV. In particular, up to 80% of the investment cost of
each project could be covered by credits made either out of the Bank loan
(up to 60%) or directly by the sponsoring bank (minimum of 20%), whereas
traditional medium-term credit is limited to 50% of the investment cost for
a new firm and to 65% for an extension. Second, although the spread on
Bank funds was only 2%, commercial banks were eager to use the Line of
Credit because it helped them expand their clientele at a time when the
general economy was weak. In this respect, BdM's decision to exclude Bank
subloans from the credit ceilings was a decisive incentive; assurances were
obtained at negotiations that this exclusion for SSI-I will be maintained.
As a result, the SSI facility was promoted effectively through the whole
banking system. BCP was the most active, as expected, having the largest
network and previous experience under the Pilot Line. BNDE, to compensate
for the lack of branches, sent missions into the regions, undertook sub-
sector studies to identify suitable SSI projects, and capitalized on the
proven appraisal capability of its 7-man SSI unit. A few middle-size
commercial banks (BMCI, BMCE, and SGMB) were also prominent in using the
first Bank loan to SSI, setting up special units staffed with engineers,
publishing booklets describing the various incentives available to SSI
promoters, and suggesting projects to promoters.

Development and Employment Creation" (No. 2365-MOR, of March 26, 1979).



- 15 -
4.17      Other Loans Earmarked for SSI.  One key goal of the first SSI Bank
loan was to establish an institutional structure able to channel other
foreign resources earmarked for SSI. The first such case was the first
OPEC Special Fund loan for $2 million made in December 1978 to Morocco and
allocated to BNDE. In May 1979, the Bank agreed to administer the loan
and, in August 1980, its eligibility criteria were harmonized with those
for the first SSI Bank loan. At the time of appraisal of this project, a
second OPEC loan was under consideration. A further loan of $7.3 million
equivalent was allocated to SSI from a KD 8 million ($29.4 million) loan to
BNDE by the Kuwait Fund signed on December 27, 1980. To assure continuity
in the financing of SSI projects before the proposed Bank SSI-II project
becomes effective, the Government of Morocco requested that the balance of
$20 million equivalent of an existing EIB loan be allocated to the SSI
scheme, and this was approved by the EIB on April 3, 1981. The loan will
fill the resource gap of the SSI scheme until shortly after mid-1981 when
the proposed Bank's SSI-II loan would become effective.
4.18      Non-Institutional Financing.  Non-institutional sources are
believed to be important providers of financing for SSI. While data are
scarce, the Government and the banks estimate that self-financing, pro-
moters' relatives and friends, money-lenders, suppliers, etc. cover more
than half of the financing requirements for Moroccan SSIs.
E. Problems and Prospects
4.19      Constraints.  The problems affecting the development of Moroccan
SSIs are not different from those observed in other countries at a similar
stage of development. The internal problems which adversely affect the
productivity of SSIs and constrain their growth include: deficient produc-
tion planning, accounting and management; poor product design and plant
layout; at times inappropriate selection of equipment; and lack of quality
control. Because of their small size, SSIs also suffer from shortages of
raw materials (most of which are indirectly imported through wholesale
dealers), and limited marketing capabilities (channelling through several
intermediaries, thus adding further to the costs). The institutional
problems faced by SSIs are mainly the limited access to institutional
financing, and the system of investment incentives with criteria which are
$8            not well tailored to SSIs (such as the encouragements for capital-intensive
projects, while SSIs are oriented toward labor-intensive projects). The
bias in favor of import-substitution and high protection built in the 1973
Investment Code has also helped to create less efficient SSIs by reducing
competition in price, quality, and technological innovation. Last but not
least, the array of Government regulation and administrative procedures
have repeatedly deterred SSI promoters from making investment decisions or
caused delays in the implementation.



- 16 -
4.20     Until the inception of the first SSI Bank project, there were no
institutions in Morocco providing effective technical or managerial assis-
tance to SSIs. The establishment of the TAU has filled the gap, but the
needs, both qualitatively and quantitatively, are large. Priorities for
technical assistance appear to be for general and financial management and
for marketing, for assistance with the selection of equipment and tech-
nology, and for on-the-job training of foremen and middle-level staff. The
program of the Technical Assistance Unit for 1981-82 (para. 4.11), reviewed
with the Bank, reflects these priorities. Some banks, such as BCP, BMCI,
and BNDE, have also established special programs to assist SSI. Lack of
access to institutional financing particularly for small SSI, is still an
important constraint to SSI development. It is hard, however, to ascertain
the true dimensions of the problem because of the reluctance of SSI pro-
moters to disclose their detailed financial position in official surveys.
A 1977 sample survey of SSI 1/ revealed a financial structure characterized
by a weak equity base, and very low ratios of working capital to fixed
assets and to turnover. Basic cost accounting is generally lacking; some
financial accounts are produced only occasionally for fiscal purposes, and
tend to be meaningless.
4.21     Prospects.  Based on the success of the SSI-I loan, the demand for
a simple financing scheme for small enterprises seems assured. The 1981-85
Plan projects DH 2,582 million ($516 million) of investment outlays by
SSIs. This represents about $103 million of foreign currency requirement
between mid-1981 and mid-1983 based on an average foreign cost component of
50% per project, and assuming a continuation of the expansionary conditions
now prevailing in the economy. Subsectors where SSI investments are
expected to be substantial because they have comparative advantages are:
light electrical and mechanical industries (DH 155 million p.a.); textiles,
and leather (DH 143 million p.a.); food industries (DH 72 million p.a.);
chemicals (DH 71 million p.a.); and construction materials (DH 49 million
p.a.).
V. BANQUE POUR LE DEVELOPPEMENT ECONOMIQUE (BNDE)
A. BNDE's Role in Project
5.01     As under SST-I (Loan 1687-MOR), the loan would be channelled to
private SSI sub-borrowers through the commercial banking system and BNDE.
To facilitate lending procedures, the Treasury will enter into a management
agreement with BNDE satisfactory to the Bank for BNDE to act as a super-
visory agent on behalf of the Treasury. BNDE in consultation with the
Treasury and the Bank will enter into joint agreement with those commercial

1978.



- 17 -
banks (including BCP) which will express interest in participating in the
SSI financing program and make a commitment to maintain adequate staff to
process SSI subloans. For more than a decade, BNDE has been associated
with commercial banks in financing of their medium-term investment credits
to projects which were either co-financed by BNDE (when longer term money
was required) or approved by BNDE for rediscounting with BdM. This
experience has demonstrated that BNDE has been able to play an advisory and
supervision role vis-a-vis commercial banks in spite of being at the same
time a co-financier or even in certain cases a direct competitor. For the
proposed project, the processing of sub-loans will follow the same pattern
as used under SSI-I. Appraisal reports on subprojects will be submitted by
participating banks to the Technical Committee following formats prepared
by BNDE. The SSI Unit of BNDE will review all appraisal reports on behalf
of the Technical Committee, write a short report summarizing the project's
characteristics and assessing whether the eligibility criteria are met.
Staffed with seven competent professionals, BNDE's SSI Unit has been able
to carry out satisfactorily its review and advisory role to the Technical
Committee in spite of the great number of subprojects submitted for
financing under the first SSI loan. To assist BNDE in this undertaking,
BNDE receives 1% per year of outstanding SSI subloans made through the
participating commercial banks under the current management agreement
between the Treasury and BNDE. BNDE is expected to continue its valuable
contribution under the proposed project. The Government has agreed to
continue the special procedure within the Caisse Centrale de Garantie so
that the guarantee to SSI sub-projects could be approved at the same time
as the sub-loans.
B. Structure
5.02     The corporate status of BNDE has remained unchanged, but its
ownership structure has somewhat been altered since the Bank's last
appraisal of BNDE in 1976. Details on BNDE's organization and ownership
structure are available in the Project File, and major features are
summarized below. As agreed with the Bank, BNDE doubled its capital to
DH 140 million ($28 million) in December 1977. The Moroccan Government
directly controls 34% and indirectly another 16% through Caisse de Depot
et de Gestion (GDB 11%), Societe Nationale d'Investissement (SNI 2.2%)
and five other publicly controlled financial institutions (2.8%). Conse-
quently, Government control has increased since 1976 from 38% to 50%,
principally through CGD which was not previously a BNDE shareholder. The
increase in Government ownership is not expected to influence BNDE's
policies and management.
5.03     There have been major changes in BNDE's management and staff
starting with the appointment as President Director-General in January 1978
of Mr. Abdelkader Benslimane, former Finance Minister. At about the same
time, BNDE's experienced Director of Economics Department and his deputy
left BNDE to fill senior positions elsewhere. Two other departments,



- 18 -
Engineering and Promotion, were also without a titular Director at the time
of appraisal. These latter developments had affected BNDE's performance
negatively, particularly as regards its economic project and sector work;
in addition, inadequate follow-up on loans resulted in mounting arrears.
These developments were regularly discussed with BNDE during supervision
missions, and were examined in detail during an appraisal in November 1980
of a ninth loan to BNDE. Partly as a result of these discussions, the
President instituted a broad organizational review of the staffing and
management needs of BNDE in the light of its widening scope of operations.
As a result, a new organizational structure 1/ able to meet BNDE's new
challenges, including its role under the project, was put into force on
January 5, 1981. At the end of 1980, BNDE's total staff of 170 included
78 professionals, compared to 60 professionals in 1976.
C. Bank Loans to BNDE
5.04      The Bank has made eight loans to BNDE amounting to $184.7 million,
net of cancellations. The BNDE VII loan (1061-MOR) of 030 million was
fully committed and disbursed before the original closing date of December
31, 1979. The BNDE VIII loan (1428-MOR) of $45 million became effective
December 21, 1977, and is now fully committed; disbursements amounted to
$35 million as of May 1, 1981, or 17% below the expectations at the time of
appraisal. The slow disbursement pace stems from the economic slowdown
experienced in Morocco during 1978-80; the loan is now expected to be fully
disbursed within six months of the original closing date of September 30,
1981. A ninth loan to BNDE, which has recently been negotiated, addresses
in detail all issues concerning BNDE's operational and financial situation.
VI. THE PROJECT
A. Objectives
6.01      The proposed project would help create industrial employment at
average costs substantially below those in industry in general by:
(a) providing resources for small entrepreneurs which otherwise would
have difficulty in securing sufficient financing for their
enterprises (at least $68.75 million of the loan);
(b) providing technical assistance to new and existing SSIs (up to
$1.0 million); and
1/ Details in the Project File.



- 19 -
(c) studies to help overcome institutional constraints and to revise
the incentives system for SSI (up to $0.25 million).
B. Justification
6.02     Sector Support.  The loan is in direct support of the Government's
policy to alleviate the high urban unemployment through industrialization,
and to expand the industrial base of the country's economy. The success of
the preceding SSI-I loan, which was committed in just over a year,
demonstrates the need for the type of financing and associated technical
assistance offered. Although there is not yet a full feedback on the
achievements of SSI-I, the Government and the Bank consider it essential
that the momentum be maintained with the proposed second loan. To bridge
the gap between commitments under SSI-I and the projected effectiveness of
SSI-II, financing has been obtained by the Moroccan Government from the
Kuwait Fund and EIB (para. 4.17).
6.03     Employment Creation.  Based on data from the BNDE-VIII SSI pilot
project, and on more tentative data from the SSI-I loan, employment would
be created at an average cost of DH 50,000 (USti0,000) per job; this
compares with an average cost of DH 190,000 (US$38,000) for employment in
the manufacturing industry in general (1981 prices).
6.04     Industrial Development.  The establishment of small enterprises
which can normally quickly adopt to changing demands, as well as the
creation of additional entrepreneurial managers, will materially assist the
industrialization program in the country. The provisions of technical
assistance to new enterprises through TAU/ODI should help to ensure that
the SSIs are economically viable and competitive. Export possibilities for
SSIs will also be investigated (para. 2.09).
C. Loan Features
6.05     Use of Loan Proceeds.  The sub-loans will be used for the
financing of the foreign exchange cost of SSI projects.  In view of the
difficulties which would be encountered in determining the actual foreign
exchange cost of each of the several hundred sub-projects which will be
financed, an average foreign exchange cost of 50% of the total project
excluding land has been established, based on an analysis of a
representative sample of sub-project now available. The same procedures
used under the SSI-I loan will be maintained. The proposed $70 million
loan, including technical assistance, would have a fixed-schedule maturity
of 15 years, with a grace period of 4 years.



- 20 -
6.06     Loan Allocation.  The loan will be allocated to three categories
of sub-projects, classified by assets of the recipient company after
establishment or expansion, as follows:
(a) Very small firms (including artisan workshops), with assets after
establishment or expansion of up to DH 1,000,000 ($200,000),
excluding land but including permanent working capital and
buildings. This category would be allocated at least 25% ($17.2
million) of the credit line component.
(b) Small firms, with assets of between DH 1,000,000 and DH 3,000,000
($600,000). At least 60% of this loan component ($41.3 million)
would be allocated for that purpose.
(c) Medium firms, with assets of between DH 3,000,000 and DH 5,000,000
($1,000,000). A maximum of 15% of this loan component ($10.3
million) would be allocated for that purpose.
6.07     The three categories are in line with those applied under SSI-I,
and will thus assure continuity in procedures used. However, the ceiling
for the very small firms has been raised from DH 500,000 under SSI-I to
DH 1,000,000. The banks had experienced great difficulty in finding small
eligible companies which would have assets of only DH 500,000 after
establishment or expansion, and this would become even more difficult under
SSI II due to inflation. In addition, the allocation of the credit line
component to the small enterprises is raised from 50% under SSI-I to 60%,
while the allocation to medium-sized enterprises is correspondingly reduced
from 25% to 15% of the credit line component.
6.08     The above changes, as well as the fact that the eligibility
ceiling for medium industries have not been raised despite the 19%
inflation which has taken place since SSI-I was signed in April, 1979,
ensure that even greater emphasis will be put on the allocation of the loan
to the smaller, more labor-intensive projects. In line with the conditions
of the previous SSI loan (1687 MOR), the FRR for all SSI sub-projects to be
financed under the proposed loan must be at least 10%; in addition, for
small firms, as defined in para. 6.06 above, the cost of products with
inputs valued at international prices must be comparable with cif prices of
similar imports, while for medium-sized SSIs a minimum ERR of 10% must also
be met.
6.09     Cost Per Job.  To promote maximum employment creation, a ceiling
on the investment per job will be maintained; as under SSI-I, the ceiling
will be indexed to the average wholesale price index for Casablanca.
Taking account of the increasing concentration of industries in the
Casablanca area, and the Government's desire to obtain a wider geographical
spread, the cost per job ceiling will be set at DH 45,000 ($9,000) in the
Casablanca area, and at DH 50,000 ($10,000) elsewhere as of July 1, 1981.
This compares with a per job cost under SSI-I of DH 44,000 in Casablanca



- 21 -
and DH 50,000 elsewhere, indexed to April 1, 1981.  In line with the provi-
sions for SSI-I, to take account of the higher equipment costs, electro-
mechanical industries will be encouraged by increasing the ceiling for job
cost by DH 10,000 both inside and outside the Casablanca area bringing the
ceiling to DH 55,000 ($11,000) and DE 60,000 ($12,000) respectively as of
July 1, 1981.
6.10      Technical Assistance to SSI.  The effective technical assistance
provided by TAU/ODI will be continued with the help of foreign experts, as
described in para. 4.08 to 4.11. It is expected that the EEC will continue
to fund the foreign exchange cost of these activities after the expiration
of the current contract in mid-1982. However, the Loan Agreement will
include provisions to permit financing from the proposed loan of the
foreign exchange cost of TAU for a two-year period 1982-1984 estimated at
$1.0 million, if additional EEC financing cannot be obtained. If it is,
this amount will be available for SSI project financing.
6.11      The Policy-Making Unit in the Ministry of Industry and Commerce
has been in operation since end-1978, but has not had a decisive impact on
policy formulation. Agreement has been reached during negotiations with
the Government to strengthen the Unit with appropriately experienced staff
to carry out the program as outlined in para. 4.08. Funding of up to $0.25
million will be provided to cover foreign exchange costs of consultants to
be engaged by the Unit to accomplish its program.
D. Procurement and Disbursement
6.12      In view of the small size of the SSI projects, and the even
smaller cost of individual investment items, 1/ SSI equipment purchases
will be made following a comparison price quotation from at least three
suppliers or contractors for medium SSIs, and from at least two suppliers
and contractors for small and very small SSIs. These procedures are satis-
factory and will be supervised by BNDE.
6.13      Disbursements will be made against statement of expenditures; this
procedure was adopted under the previous SSI loan and has worked satis-
factorily. The estimated disbursement schedule of the loan is given in
Annex 4; the loan is expected to be fully committed by December 31, 1983,
and to be fully disbursed by June 30, 1986.
1/ Mainly individual pieces of machinery and equipment, with estimated
costs between $1,000 and $50,000.



- 22 -
E. Benefits and Risks
6.14     The SSI loan component will assist in the financing of about 600
existing and new SSIs, which will provide approximately 15,000 new jobs at
an estimated average cost of $9,500 per job. On the basis of experience
gained with SSI-I, there is only a minimal risk that this project will not
achieve its major objectives.
6.15     During supervision of the small number of SSI in operation and
financed under the previous loan, some discrepancies from the set SSI
parameters were found, particularly regarding the number of workers
employed and consequently the cost per job criteria. Although corrective
steps will be taken by the supervising banks in Morocco, a certain risk
continues that a number of non-SSI enterprises will also benefit from the
project.
6.16     The TAU has been providing very satisfactory services to the SSI,
and there is no risk that this will not continue. However, the Policy Unit
needs strengthening to meet its obligations, and the staffing and
performance of the Unit will be closely monitored during supervision.
VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01     During loan negotiations, agreement was reached on the following
points:
(a) technical assistance to SSI to be continued through TAU/ODI, and
provisions for funding of foreign exchange cost of technical
experts (para. 6.10);
(b) Policy-Making Unit for SSI to be strengthened, and program to be
executed; funding of the foreign exchange cost of studies on
incentives to be undertaken (para. 6.11);
(c) limits for SSI eligibilities, and allocation of loan component
amounts (para. 6.06);
(d) percentage of total cost of each SSI subproject to be financed
(para. 6.05);
(e)  cost per job limits (para. 6.09);
(f) amount of SSI loan and maturity (para. 6.05);
(g) procurement procedures (para. 6.12); and
(h) agreement by BdM to continue exempting SSI loans from credit
ceiling restrictions.



- 23 -
7.02     Conditions of Effectiveness of the proposed loan are:
(a) execution of a convention by the Government and BNDE for
administration of the loan, satisfactory to the Bank (para 5.01);
(b) conclusion of a standard covention by BNDE, on terms and
conditions satisfactory to the Bank, with not less than three
commercial banks, including the Banque Centrale Populaire (para 5.01).
7.03     A loan of $70 million to the Government of Morocco to support SSIs
is recommended.
