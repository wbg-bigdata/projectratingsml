SECOND SMAHLL-SCALE INDUSTRY PRQJET
(LOAN 2038-MOR)
PREFACE
Loan 2038-MOR, (SSI II Project; US$70.0 million) was approved by
the Bank on July 14, 1981. The Loan closed on June 30, 1988 following two
extensions of the closing date. Of the original loan amount, US$26.45
million was disbursed, and US$43.55 million was cancelled.
The Industry and Energy Division, Country Department II, of the
World Bank's Europe, Middle East and North Africa Regional Office prepared
the Preface, Evaluation Summary, and Parts I and III of this Project
Completion Report (PCR). The Borrower prepared Part II.
The Bank's sections of the PCR are based on a review of the Staff
Appraisal Report, the Loan, Guarantee and Project Agreements, supervision
reports, data provided by the Borrower, and all other relevant
documentation available in the Bank's project files.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
MOROCCO
SECOND SMALL-SCALE INDUSTRY PROJECT
(LOAN 2038-MOR)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
1. During the 1970s, the Government of Morocco perceived a need to reorient some
of its investment in industry towards maximizing efficiency in resource
allocation and employment creation. The development and employment creation
potential of small-scale industries (SSIs) represented an area of particular
interest (Part I, paras. 1 and 2). To focus more attention on the SSI sector,
the Government, in 1978, created a unit within the Ministry of Commerce and
Industry to formulate policies for developing small-scale industry and
established a Technical Assistance Unit, Service d'Assistance Technique (SAT),
to assist the technical and managerial functioning of SSIs. The Government also
sought and obtained a World Bank loan for the Eirst Small-Scale Industries
Project (Ln. No. 1687-NOR; US$ 25 million, approved April, 1979), in support of
the new strategy for SSI development.
Objectives
2. The SSI II project sought to build on the apparent success of SSI I (which
initially had a very high rate of commitments) by: (a) extending resources to
entrepreneurs who otherwise would have had difficulty securing financing, and
(b) providing technical assistance to revise the incentives system for the SSI
development and help new and existing SSIs overcome institutional constraints.
On July 14, 1981, the Bank approved Loan No. 2038-MOR, to the Kingdom of Morocco,
for US$ 70 million in support of this SSI II. The Bank made the loan to the
Kingdom of Morocco. Of the total loan proceeds, US$ 68.75 million was for
onlending through BEDE and commercial banks to small-scale industries to create
new enterprises and expand existing ones. The various categories for onlending
are described in Part I, para. 7. The remaining US$ 1.25 million was allocated
for technical assistance to new and existing SSIs (up to US$ 1.0 million), and
for studies (US$0.25 million) to help overcome institutional constraints and tc
revise the incentives system for SSI development.
Implementation Experience
3.     The implementation experience of the SSI II project confirmed some of the
preliminary results of the SSI I PCR of October 1984, (Part I, par s. 14-16).
Since the Bank had prepared that PCR dxxring the implementation stage of SSI II,
some of the lessons learned under the first project could not be incorporated
in the design of the second. The supervision work of SSI II nevertheless, took
account of lessons learned under SSI I, and took action on some of them during
the implementation of the second operation (Part I, para. 18 ). Effectiveness
of SSI II was delayed due to an erroneous legal opinion related to the Project
Agreement and to delays in recruiting consultants for technical assistance under
the Project.  Several extensions of the loan closing date were approved to take
into account difficulties in collecting withdrawal documentation for the large
number of small sub-projects financed under the loan, and issues related to sub-
project eligibility (Part 1, para. 14). Furthermore, the original loan amount
was reduced from US 70 million to US$ 30 million due to lower than expected



- iv -
demand for sub-project financing resulting from the difflcult economic situation
prevailing at the outset of Project implementatlon (Part I, para. 18), and from
the fact that the PBs motivation to on-lend the funds was diminished due to
administrative and procedural factors which rendered SSI lending (Part I, paras.
19-20) less attractive to them.
Results
4.    Sub-project financing under SSI II totaled DH 129.7 million, supporting
DE 638 million In SSI investment. 17,266 jobs were created under this operation
--- 15X more than the appraisal estimate and significantly more than under
SSI I (8,500). The relatively high levels of employment generated by SSI II is
explained by the fact that a high proportion of the investment sub-projects
financed were in labor-intensive enterprises.    It is notevorthy that the
investment cost-per-job under this operation (DH 36,946, or US$ 5,474) was
considerably lover than the average for manufacturing industries in general
(about DR 190,000, or US$ 28,358).
Sustaiuabili
5.    Despite the reticence to fully utilize the loan proceeds of SSI II,
commercial banks have become more active in SSI lending as a result of this
operation.   In order for such lending to continue to expand in the future
however, the authorities, the Bank, and the PB's should take account of the
lessons learned from the SSI II experience.
Lessons Learned
6.    This PCR discusses the combined lessons learned under the SSI I and SSI
II projects. Both projects have been successful in terms of creating jet) at
a lover cost than the Industrial average (para 22). However, neither SSI I or
SSI II was able to decentralize SSI investment for reasons discusseu in para.
25 (b).    The report concludes that the policy-making unit of the Ministry of
Commerce and Industry and the financial institutions should review industrial
investment decentralization policies with a view to formulating a more realistic
and effective strategy. In addition, a new strategy is required to improve the
system of loan guarantees and collateral since the comrercial banks continue to
overburden clients with personal and physical guarantees (Part I, para. 20).
Concerning the SAT, neither SSI project was able to bring about substantial
improvements in its operation; the problems hindering its effectiveness are
discussed in paras. 16 and 25 (d).  ,The Government should review the assistance
needs of the SSI sector to determine the most effective way of meeting them (Part
I, para. 25 d). For very small projects, the Bank's demonstrated flexibility
during SSI II implementation should be (and has been) continued when lending
to SSIs is possible under its other lines of credit.   Given some of the
difficulties experienced in SSI project implementation and supervision, which
seem to stem from the nature of such credit operations, OED should consider
undertaking a cross-country comparative analysis of Bank-financed lines of credit
to determine the broader lessons that emerge, and the improvements which can be
brought to this type of Bank lending activities.

SECOND SMALL-SCALE INDUSTRY PROJECT
(LOAN 2038-MOR)
PART I: PROJECT REVIEW FROM THE BANK'S PERSPECTIVE
Project Identity
Proiect Name:  Second Small-Scale Industry Project (SSI II)
Loan No.:      2038-NOR
RVP Unit:      EMENA
Country:       Morocco
Sector:        Industry
Subsector:     Small-Scale Industry
I. Backeround
1. Introduction. During the 1970s, Morocco had embarked on an ambitious
public investment program spurred by large increases in the price of
phosphates, the country's main export commodity.  Public investment programs
during this period had emphasized capital intensive projects with limited
returns and costly infrastructure projects in excess of the country's needs.
Productivity of capital was low and employment creation was limited. The
Government began to recognize the need to reorient some investment towards
maximizing efficiency in resource allocation and employment creation. The
development and employment creation potential of SSI's represented one area
where such investment was appropriate.
2. Small-Scale Industries Subsector. In the late 1970's, estimates were that
there were some 3,000 small-scale enterprises, employing about 42,000 workers
(between 10 and 49 workers per enterprise) and representing some 20X of
manufacturing employment and value added. To focus more attention on the SSI
sector, in 1978 the Government created a policy-making unit within the
Ministry of Commerce and Industry to formulate policies for developing
small-scale industry and established a Technical Assistance Unit. Service
d'Assistance Technique (SAT), to assist the technical and managerial
functioning of SSIs. The Government also sought and obtained the First
Small-Scale Industries loan (US$ 25 million; Ln. No. 1687-NOR; approved April,
1979) from the Bank, in support of these new directions.
3. SSI I. Preparation of the SSI I project began during the final year of
Morocco's Third Development Plan (1973-77) which had emphasized the
development of large public enterprises, and medium to large privately owned
industries. In response to the country's changing economic environment, the
Fourth Development Plan (1978-80) called for enhanced Government rupport to



2
small and medium-scale industries to create employment at a cost per job lower
than that of large industries, and to help improve integ;ation of the existing
industrial structure. The preparation of SSI I drew on the successful
experience of an SSI pilot component in the eighth Bank loan to the Banque
Nationale de D6veloppement Economique (BNDE VIII, Ln. 1428-MOR) which had
allocated US$5 million for SSI financing as well as funds for the carrying out
of a sector study to identify the potential for, and the constraints to, SSI
development.
4. SSI I consisted of $24 million in credit to small businesses, and $1
million in expert assistance to the technical assistance unit, Service
d'Assistance Technique (SAT) of the Office du D6veloppement Industriel(ODI).
The line of credit was committed a year ahead of schedule. It financed 214
subprojects compared to the 200 sub-projects estimated at the time of
appraisal. Of this total, 65X were for new enterprises. Under 5SI I, 8,500
jobs were created amounting to 70 X more than the appraisal estimates. The
average cost per job created vas US $5,000 or about five to six times less
than the average cost in the manufacturing industry as a whole.   About US$
7.9 million of the original loan amount of US$ 25 million was cancelled due to
the appreciation of the dollar in relation to the Dirham (DH), and to disuse
of the available funds due to the unavailability of complete documentation to
participating banks (PBs) on sub-project expenditures (paras 18(b), 25(e)).
5. Despite impressive results in terms of employment creation, SSI I fell
short of its objectives in the following areas: (a) decentralization of
industrial investments from Casablanca to economically depressed regions; (b)
support to very small industries (the actual amount lent was only half the
original target); and (c) improvements in the terms and conditions of SSI
lending (i.e. maturities, grace periods, and sub-loan guarantees).
rFurthermore, the SSI I Project Completion Report (PCR) indicated that more
selective monitoring of sub-project implementation could have improved the
terms and conditions of SSI lending. The same PCR stated that a thorough
assessment of achievements would await the results of the SSI II project.
However, at the time that that PCR was prepared (October 1984), the combined
experience under both projects indicated that: (a) SSI development in Morocco
was capable of generating employment at a very low cost and with limited
Government intervention; (b) the institutional framework established under the
first project and carried over to the second project was sound and could be
maintained for future operations; (c) the institutions concerned with SSI
development needed to enhance their capability to respond to changes in the
investment climate, particularly in the areas of strengthening and focusing of
investment activities; and (d) there was a need to strengthen conditions
leading to more active use of the Bank's line of credit, such as a greater
interest spread to participsting Banks and improved procedures for guarantees
on defaulting subloans.

II. SSI XII
6. Pro1ect Description. The SSI II loan (Ln. No. 2038-NOR, approved July 14,
1981, originally for US$ 70 million, was made to the Kingdom of Morocco for
onlending through BNDE and commercial banks to small-scale industries to
c-.eate new enterprises and expand existing ones. The rationale was to provide
resources to entrepreneurs (US$ 68.75 million) who otherwise would have had
difficulty securing financing. It also provided for technical assistance to
new and existing SSIs (up to US$ 1.0 million) and financed studies (US$0.25
million) to help overcome institutional constraints and to revise the
incentives system for the development of SSIs.
7. The terms of the sub-loans were to conform to the economic life of the
sub-projects, with a max4Im" maturity of 12 years and a maximum grace period
of three years. Interest rates were to be those prevailing for loans to
industry. As with SSI I, BNDE was both a direct lender and the apex
institution (agent of the Government) to supervise the commercial banks'
management of the funds onlent to them. Sub-loans were approved and project
implementation was coordinated by a Technical Committee with representation
from the Ministeries of Finance, Commerce and Industry, as well as the Central
Bank (Banque du Maroc), Office de Developpement Industrial (ODI), and BNDE.
Eighty percent of the sub-loans were to be guaranteed by the Government's
Caisse Centrale de Garantie (CCG), and guarantees were to be approved at the
same time as the sub-loan approval.
8.Sub-loans were to finance up to 50 percent of the total cost of SSI II
sub-projects, representing their estimated foreign exchange content. Proceeds
of the Bank loan were to be allocated among three categories of sub-projects:
(a) very small firms with assets of up to DH 1 million (US$ 200,000) --25X of
the loan amount;
(b) small firms, with assets between DH one million and DH 3 million :between
US$ 200,000 and US$ 600,000) -- at least 60 X of the loan amount;
(c) medium firms, with assets between DH 3 million and DH 5 million (US$
600,000 and US$ 1,000,000) -- at most 151 of the loan amount.
9. To promote maximum employment creation, ceilings were placed on the
investment per job requirement. The investment cost per job ceiling was set
slightly higher for enterprises outside Casablanca (DH 50,000, equivalent to
about US$ 10,000) than for enterprises around Casablanca (DH 45,000) in order
to encourage decentralization of investment and employment creation. For the
electromechanical industry, the ceiling was set at DH 55,000 (US$11,000) in
the Casablanca area and DH 60,000 (US$ 12,000) elsewhere. SSI II was expected
to create 15,000 jobs at an average investment cost of US$ 9,500 per job.
10. The technical assistance component of the Project was to be implemented by
the policy making unit at the Ministry of Commerce and Industry and by the
SAT. At project appraisal, it had been agreed that the SAT would: (a)



4
identify and prepare projects in coordination with the participating banks and
the Ministry of Industry; (b) provide technical advice to entrepreneurs in
procuring equipment and in preparing financing requests; (c) facilitate
project implementation through assistance in identification and resolution of
infrastructural and administrative problems; and (d) assist in identifying and
solving management, production, accounting and financial problems of SSIs. In
particular, the assistance under SSI II was to focus on identifying investment
opportunities by creating a data bank and helping promoters with project
processing, holding seminars on important management topics and assisting SSIs
in the their cbjice of equipment and technology. The t.a. component was to
have been comprised of 96 man-months of technical assistance including 18
man-months of consultant time to review existing policy and incentives related
to SSIs.
11. During negotiations, the Bank and the Government also agreed to strengthen
the SSI Policy Making tnit within the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. The
Unit was to focus on: (a) the involvement of SSIs in executing public
contracts; (b) quality control of products and marketing, particularl' for
exports; and (c) improvements in the structure of SSI incentives. The Bank
loan was to meet the foreign exchange cost of studies necessary to address
these issues (estimated at US$ 250,000).
12. Prolect Design and Orzanization. The Project's design and organization
derived from those of SSI I, which had proven successful in encouraging the
development of SSIs. However, projected loan demand under SSI II was
significantly below the planned target, as evidenced in the Project's rer  ts
(para. 13). Loan demand mainly was affected by changes in the economy during
the implementation of the SSI II Project, as well as by certain administrative
bottlenecks due to the design of the financing procedures under the loan.
These bottlenecks, identified in a 1985 study undertaken by BNDE and the
Ministry of Finance, were as follows:
(a) unfamiliarity of entrepreneurs with financing procedures;
(b) lengthy waiting periods for processing loan applications;
(c) cumbersome procedures for justifying expenses under sub-projects; and
(d)  slowness in the authorization of sub-projects due to the absence of a
free-limit procedure.
13. To alleviate these bottlenecks and improve the implementation of SSI II,
the Bank agreed in 1985 to increase project eligibility limits and to create a
free-limit procedure for sub-project authorization. It also agreed to
simplified disbursement procedures for special cases where complete
documentation was unavailable. These actions are described in greater detail
in the following section.



5
1III Project Implementation and Results
14. General. The SSI II loan (US$70 million) was declared effective in
February, 1983 following a one year delay due to submission to the Bank of an
erroneous legal opinion of the Project Agreement, and to delays in recruiting
consultants to undertake studies    The original loan amount was reduced
twice, to US$40 million in Ju. -  34, and to US$30 million in December 1986,
because of lower than expected comnitments relative to loan size. The
original and actual disbursement schedule of the loan are presented in Annex
2. The limit date for commitments under the loan was extended from December
31, 1983, to December 31, 1987. The closing date, originally June 30, 1986,
was extended several times (to June 30, 1988) to take account of difficulties
in collecting documentation for a large number of small sub-projects, and of
ongoing special efforts of PBs to expedite outstending withdrawal applications
to maximize disbursements. The loan account finally closed on March 31, 1989.
By account closing, disbursements had reached US@26.4 million (88% of the
revised loan amount) and the undisbursed portion fUS$3.6 million) of the loan
was cancelled.
15. Profile of Sub-Loan Activity. During the period 1983-1987, 514 small
enterprises received sub-loans under SSI II, equivalent to DH 129.7 million,
to support investments on the order of DH 638 million (about US $75 million).
Two-thirds of the loan proceeds were for the creation or expansion of
enterprises in the food, textiles and leather subsectors. About 701 of the
proceeds were for the creation of new enterprises end 30% fox the
extension/modernization of existing ones. As outlined in the project
description (para. 6), the loan proceeds were on-lent through BNDE and ten
commercial banks (Annex 5).  BCP accounted for 58% of thv total number of
sub-loans while the relative share of the ten other PBs averaged about 4.2X.
About half of the sub-loans were made to enterprises in the Casablanca area.
16. Profile of Technical Assistance and Studies. The Service d'Assistance
Technique (SAT), a unit located within the Office de Developpement Industriel
(ODI), was established in 1978 to provide technical assistance under both the
SSI I and SSI II projects. Aside from providing some consultant assistance to
a small number of enterprises, SAT was not able to provide the support
enterprises needed to prepare new projects and resolve problems faced by
borrowers in securing loans due to budgetary constraints. Futhermore, demand
from enterprises for SAT services declined when in 1985/86 the SAT was obliged
to begin charging for its services. Of the US$1.25 million allocated to
technical assistance and studies under the SSI II, only about US$32,000 was
disbursed.
17. The components for technical assistance and studies under the Project are
described in paragraph 10. The technical assistance component was implemented
in 1984-85. The study on incentives to SSIs was completed in 1986, and it
confirmed the fihdings of the July, 1983 and October, 1984 Bank missions which
produced the Bank Study of Small-Scale and Artisanal Industry (IBRD Report No.
5056 MOR), issued in March, 1986. The latter study proposed a definition of



6
SSIs based on the size of the assets of the enterprises rather than the branch
of activity. It revealed that SSIs with assets of up to DH 7 million employed
more than 110,000 persons and generated about one fifth of the value added by
the manufacturing sector, accolrnting for less than 41 of Morocco's GDP.
According to SSI surveys, the major problems SSIs had faced since 1980 were:
growing competition in traditional export markets; limited access to medium-
and long-term financing for investment and working capital; lack of skilled
labor and technicians; cumbersome administrative procedures for investment and
trade; and lack of institutional assistance to identify new product lines and
market opportunities. Although the report found that some improvements had
been made in these areas, it also projected difficulties in expanding SSI
investment considering Morocco's existing economic and financial problems, and
the weak institutional support and policy framework for SSIs. The report also
analyzed the labor intensity of SSI investment and recommended that the job
creation objectives of the Bank loan should be maintained, if significant
changes were to be made to the project eligibility criterion for SSI projects
(para. 18b) financed by the Bank. A long series of detailed recommendations
are provided in Volume II of that Report.
IV. Project Performance Analysis
18. Demand for Sub-Loans. SSI II Project data on the level of demand for
sub-loans, in terms of numbers of loans, reflect changes in the overall
economic situation as well as administrative changes in financing procedures
for sub-project approval and disbursement. During the 1983-84 economic crisis
(see a below), the number of small-scale enterprises granted sub-loans under
the Project increased by only 161 (from 64 to 74). Between 1984 and 1985
however, the annual number of new sub-loans increased by 27X (from 74 to 94)
and then jumped by nearly 501 in 1986 (from 94 to 140). The latter level was
roughly maintained in 1987 (Annex 3). The sharp increase in demand for
sub-loans demonstrated after 1985 reflects the impact of:
(a) the economic reform grogrsms. begun in 1984 in response to the
economic crisis. In 1983, following the decline in international
phosphate prices and increases in world oil prices of the early 1980s,
Morocco experienced a major economic crisis. Outstanding external
debt reached 10O1 of GDP, foreign exchange reserves were nearly
depleted, and GNP growth declined to about 21 per year, barely keeping
pace with population growth. The country was forced into debt
rescheduling, emergency import restrictions were imposed, and public
expenditures were massively curtailed. In 1984, the Government
embarked upon a multi-phased stabilization cum adjustment program,
with Bank and IMF assistance. While reduced, the public investment
programs included in the Government's new strategy sought to ensure
that only priority proje.cts, which contributed to the twin objectives
of stabilization and growth, were undertaken. Consistent with this,
the Government maintained its move towards the development of SSIs
(para. 1). The reform programs were designed to reduce aggregate



7
demand, increase efficient production through reforms in incentives
for agriculture and industry, enhance private sector savings and
improve investment allocation through financial sector reforms. The
Bank supported these structural reforms through two Industrial Trade
Policy Adjustment (ITPA) loans. The ITPA programs emphasized export
promotion and import liberalization, and included reforms in fiscal
policies, as well as in the financial and public enterprise sectors.
Of particular relevance to small-scale industry were export incentives
introduced through these programs, and the reduction of import
protection (thus enhancing competition). Special tax advantages for
the development of small-scale enterprises were also introduced.
(b) the changes in procedures for sub-project approvals. disbursement
against the nroceeds of the Bank loan, and sub-lending bank margins
for loan transactions.  In the course of project implementation the
Bank had agreed to: (i) increase the margin of the commercial banks
from 21 to 31; (ii) raise the eligibility limits for sub-projects by
size of firm'/, (iii) introduce a free limit for Project commitments
set at DH 500,000 (or US$50,000) in 1985, and (iv) permit full
disbursement of a sub-loan based on documentation of 851 of
expenditures with certification by the PB that a visit to a given
sub-project site had revealed satisfactory implementation2/.
19. As noted earlier (para. 14), the demand, in dollar terms, for SSI II funds
was lower than expected as a result of which about 601 of the original loan
was cancelled. While the difficult economic situation prevailing at the
outset of Project implementation had an undeniable impact on the use of the
Bank loan, demand for Bank funds was also hindered by a lack of strong
motivation on the part of the PBs to utilize these funds because: (a) their
project pipelines were dominated by new creation activities which are
1/ During project implementation, sub-project eligibility ceilings were
raised from those originally in the Project design (para. 8): for small scale
industries the ceiling was raised to DH 4 million; for medium-scale, labor-
intensive enterprises, the ceiling was raised to DH 8 million. This was done
in order to broaden the base of eligible subprojects in light of inflation
affecting the Dirham.
I/ This procedure was established in 1988 along with special procedures
in exceptional cases, i.e. for construction, civil works or equipment. In
such cases, if the sub-borrower was unable to provide evidence of payment, the
Bank could allow withdrawal from the Bank loan upon certification and
evaluation by a qualified engineer, of completion of works based on sub-
project inspection.

generally more risky than extension projects; (b) arrears were still owed to
them against losses under SSI I sub-projects; (c) they lacked ronfidence in
the Government guarantee agency, Caisse Centrale de Garantie (CCG) to provide
sufficient default protection to them for problematic subloans; and (d) their
transactions margin remained low in relation to costs associated with
processing and monitoring the sub-loans, even after the 1985 increase to 3%
(compared to 4-5X on transaction involving their own funds). In addition, the
positive results of the SSI I project had, by the start of SSI II, rendered
aid financing for SSIs readily available, on terms and conditions more
advantageous than those of the Bank loan. Although, in dollar terms, demand
for SSI II funds was lower than expected, it is noteworthy that the number of
sub-loans made with only 38X of the original loan amount was close to that
originally expected (514 vs. 600). Accordingly, the Bank loan was used
principally for smaller enterprises, and the cost per job created was lower
than anticipated at appraisal (para.22).
20. A 1984 BNDE survey of projects financed under SSI I had revealed that:
(a) only 571 of the sub-loans had normal disbursement profiles; (b) arrears of
the PBs were about 161 of the combined outstanding balance of sub-loans; and
(c) 71 of the sub-loans were under legal proceedings. BCP, the PB most
affected by arrears under SSI I, was also the PB which financed the bulk of
projects under SSI II. Although the arrears situation showed improvement, PBs
remained understandably concerned about the need for effective loan guarantees
and collateral during SSI II, given the SSI I portfolio performance. In case
of sub-loan default, the CCG guarantee system was to cover 801 of losses
incurred by a client PB. In order to qualify for the CCG guarantee however,
the PBs were required to pay a one-time fee ranging from 1.25X to 3.25% of the
sub-loan principal, depending on the duration of the sub-loan. In addition,
the guarantee procedures only entitled PBs' reimbursement by CCG after PB's
had exhausted all possible means to collect the funds on their own (including
legal proceedings), which generally takes at least two years after the initial
declaration of default. Moreover, the bureaucratic slowness of the CCG in
reimbursement for claims, and its occasional failure to pay claims at all, had
led many PBs to adopt an even more conservative approach to lending, further
limiting the use of the Bank's funds.
21. Enterprise Creation vs. Exnansion. A breakdown of SSI II sub-loans by
those granted for the creation of new firms (701) and those for the
expansion/modernization of existing ones (301) is given in Annex 6. The main
reason for the large share of new enterprises in the loan portfolio derives
from the fact that the preferred source of financing for enterprise expansion
had been through leasing arrangements. The evolution of loan demand, however,
indicates that an increasing number of extensions and modernizations vs. new
firms were financed under the Project after 1985. According to BNDE, the
evolution may be explained by: (a) increases in the assets of these firms due
to new purchases of equipment; and (b) establishment of a free-limit procedure
for obtaining funds under the Bank loan, obviating the need for detailed
documentation for authorizations up to a certain limit, and enhancing the use
of Bank funds to purchase, rather than lease, equipment.

22. Employment Creation. The sub-loans under the Bank project were associated
with investments totalling DH 637 million (US$ 94 million), and a related
investment cost per job of DH 36,946 (US$ 5,474). This compares to an average
cost per job of DH 190,000 (US$28,358) for employment in the manufacturing
industry in general. As previously indicated, the large cancellations from
the original Bank loan amount did not adversely affect actual performance in
terms of job creation and average cost per job. In fact, performance in these
areas was better than originally expected in the SAR. To wit, 15X more jobs
were created than originally expected, at an average cost per job of only 581
of that estimated at appraisal. In addition, though ultimately similar in loan
amounts, the number of jobs created under SSI II (17,266) was significantly
higher than under SSI I (8,500). This could also be largely explained by the
fact that sub-loans under SSI I were distributed more evenly across several
sub-sectors, while those under SSI II were concentrated in more
labor-intensive and export-oriented sub-sectors (i.e., agro-industries,
textiles and leather).
23. Terms and Conditions of Sub-Loans.   To ease pressure on the cash flows of
enterprises with difficult debt situations, and to reduce the risk of default
to PB's, the Bank had recommended (under SSI I) that loan maturities be
lengthened. It was therefore agreed during SSI II that the optimal maturity
for loans to SSI's should be about eight years. Annex 7 compares the loan
maturities under SSI I and SSI II. That annex indicates that under SSI I,
only 16X of the sub-loans had maturities of more than five years, and less
than 1X had loan maturities of eight years or more. Under SSI II, 46X of all
sub-loans had maturities of greater than five years, and 321 of the total had
maturities of eight years or more.   In turn, the higher maturities under SSI
II resulted in a reduced incidence of arrears to PB's and of default by SSI's.
V. Bank/Borrower Performance
24. Despite Bank/Borrower efforts to improve the procedures under the Bank
loan, the anticipated dollar level of loan demand did not materialize and the
motivation of the PBs to use the Bank loan was diminished for the reasons
outlined in paragraph 19. There is an inherent difficulty in the supervision
of SSI lines of credit due to the large number and variety of sub-projects
under such loans. In addition, follow-up with respect to technical assistance
activities seems to have been of lesser priority under this project than
efforts made to ensure the maximum use of Bank funds, given the large
discrepancy between demand and loan amount. These factors notwithstanding,
supervision efforts by the Bank and the PB's overall were satisfactory. Eight



10
supervision missions were launched by Bank staff, and an estimated 40
staffweeks, were devoted to this effortl/. BNDE's supervision activities
improved considerably during project implementation. Regular status reports
were submitted to the Bank which were based on a large and varied enough
sample of sub-projects to be meaningful. When bottlenecks appeared in
commitments and disbursements due to elements related to, or which could be
addressed through, project design, the Bank and the PBs responded and agreed
on revisions which improved performance in these areas. In addition, the
Bank's push to convince the PBs to increase sub-loan maturities ameliorated
their portfolio performance, Thus, although the size of the loan was reduced
and changes were made to the scope of the project, the PBs' use of Bank funds
and supervision activities were satisfactory. Tardiness however was
occasionally experienced in the submission of audit reports. Finally, the
need to finalize the Ministry of Commerce and Industry's report on incentives
to SSIs was pre-empted by the more generalized industrial and trade
discussions and reforms which developed following the 1983 economic crisis
(para. 18 (a)).
VI. Lessons Learned and Recommendations
25. SSI II was prepared before the conc3,isive results of SSI I were available.
The success of SSI I at the time carried excessive weight in the formulation
of the demand projections contained in SSI II. Many of the lessons which
could have been learned from the first project, therefore, were unfortunately
not incorporated in the original design of the second project. The combined
experience under both projects nevertheless indicates that:
(a) the Bank's two SSI projects have been successful in terms of job
creation, at a lower cost than the industrial average (see para 22).
Demand for SSI investment financing was in line with projections under
SSI I. It was however far below expectations under SSI II. This
shortfall was due mainly to the cotintry's economic situation, to the
design of authorization and disbursement procedures for subloans, and
to the availability of other competitive forms of credit. At the time
of appraisal, these risks were not explicitly stated among the risks
anticipated under the project.
(b) despite the fact that on-lending to SSIs continues to be heavily
dominated by one bank (BCP the main bank which caters to small-scale
enterprises), commercial banks have generally become more active in
SSI lending since the implementation of these Bank lines of credit.
The continued lower participation of other PB's in SSI financing may
be due to the relatively more limited access of SSI's to those banks,
'/ This estimate is derived from the number of missions and of mission
members, and assumes an additional 3-4 SW's per year for headquarters
supervision work. The actual reported time indicated in the Time Recording
System (28.5 SW's) appears erroneous, as mission work alone would exceed that
amount. A supervision summary is provided in Annex 8.



11
and to the nature of the clientele preferred to be served by other
banks. These factors alone limit the degree to which the objectives
of decentralization and diversification in the development of SSI's
can be attained, as the SSI projects were unable to significantly
improve the regional distribution of such investments. This issue
should therefore be reviewed with the policy-making unit of the
Ministry of Commerce and Industry and with the financial institutions
with a view to formulate a more realistic and effective strategy for
decentralization.
(c) a new strategy needs to be developed to improve the system of loan
guarantees and collateral (para. 20). In spite of the Government's
determination to reform and rehabilitate the CCG as expressed during
the appraisal of SSI II, little was achieved and the commercial banks
continue to overburden clients with personal and physical guarantees.
(d) neither SSI project was able to bring about substantial
improvements in the operation of the SAT. The SAT's effectiveness has
continued to be hindered by the: (a) lack of budget and staff to meet
the needs of a large caseload of enterprises with technical and
managerial difficulties; and (b) lack of interest on the part of
enterprises in these services, particularly since most do not seem to
be willing to pay for them. The Government should review the
assistance needs of the SSI sector to determine the most effective way
of meeting them, either through an improved SAT or through selected
consultant services such as those offered by non-governmental
organizations (NGO's) and bi-lateral agencies.
(e) for very small projects, the Bank's procedural and documentation
requirements for commitments and disbursements have consistently
proven cumbersome and unrealistic in the case of SSI lending to
Morocco. This has been particularly true for small construction
projects, where documents such as invoices and other evidence of
payment cannot be provided by the sub-borrower. The Bank's
demonstrated flexibility in this regard during the implementation of
this project should be (and has been) continued when lending to SSIs
is possible under its other lines of credit. The need for such
simplified procedures should be considered however, as early as
possible in project preparation/implementation.
VII. Summarv and Conclusion
26. Overall, the implementation experience of the SSI II project confirmed
some of the preliminary results of the SSI I PCR of October 1984, and provided
certain additional lessons which could have been incorporated in the original
project's design, had project preparation not overlapped with the
implementation of the first project. Nervertheless, during implementation,
many of the lessons learned under SSI I were incorporated in SSI II project
supervision activities, and changes were made to the second projects' design.
In addition, the magnitude of the 1983-84 economic crisis and its impact on
the implementation of the second project provided for a very different



12
environment in which implementation took place than that of SSI I. In
response to the economic crisis, between 1984 and 1986, 15 of the Bank's
projects in Morocco were formally restructu-ed and loan amounts reduced (under
the Bank's Special Action Program--SAP), to adjust the projects and their
financing arrangements to the constrained economic conditions. While SSI II
was not formally included in the group of Moroccan projects approved for the
SAP's provisions, the reduction in its loan amount and changes made to its
design during this period were consistent with the Bank's overall approach to
projects in the country, and were appropriate. They were also consistent with
the recommendations of the Bank's Small Scale and Artisanal Industry Study
(para. 17) in that they allowed for project implementation to continue toward
the attainment of the Project's objectives, though at a more limited level and
moderate pace.
27.     Finally, the combined implementation experience of the Morocco SSI
projects reaffirm the view that certain of their characteristics and lessons
learned could be generally relevant to other SSI Bank credit operationsl/. An
OED cross-country comparative analysis of DFC implementation experiences could
provide a useful basis on which to review Bank practices such that the
attainment of project objectives could be facilitated.
/ i.e. The targeting of loan proceeds by size of enterprise rather
than branch of activity, and the simplification of disbursement procedures.

PART II:  PROJECT &?VIEW FRON THE BORROWER'S PERSPECTyVE
A.        GENE
The agreement relating to Loan 2038-40R was signed in 1981 but did
not become effective until 1983. The original amount of US$70 million was
twice downscaled, first to US$40 milliC.a ar4 then to US$30 million.
The closing dates were also extended several times, being ultimately
set at December 12, 1987 for commitments and March 31, 1989 for withdrawals.
Finally, a number of amendments were made:
-    Introduction of the Free Limit;
-    Uniform cost-per-job ceiling;
-    Raising (on two occasions) of the net assets figure;
-    Increasing of the banks' margin;
-    Modification of the release procedure;
-    Adaptation of the procedure for justifying investment expenditures
to the actual circumstances of the SSI1, etc.
Thanks to these measures and notwithstanding the unfavorable
economic situation that prevailed from 1983 to 1985, Loan 2038-4OR was 100%
utilized as regards commitmenzs and nearly 90S as regards withdrawals.
The considerable number of measures taken and their impact on SSI
promotion in Morocco are evidence of the attention and interest of the parties
participating in the system and particularly the State, IBRD and 8NDE.
IBRD was consistently concerned to ensure effective execution of
project 2038-MOR and followed its implementation with great attention and
diligence, sending about seven experts to Morocco in the course of the
project. These experts always worked in close collaboration with the BNDE
management and staff and the other members of the Technical Committee.
Visits to the participating banks and companies were arranged by
BENDE whenever necessary.
The aides-memoire and the interesting reports drawn up by these
experts were most helpful for better monitoring of the management of the loan
proceeds, and also 'erved as the basis for certain of the amendments made to
the procedure.
BNDE, as Secretary of the Technical Committee and manager of the
loan resources, played a central role in the project. Its experience in the
financing of industrial projects and the mobilization of international lines
of credit was very beneficial for the system set up for the financing,
promotion and accurate monitoring of SSts in Morocco, for which purpose it
provided itself with the human and material resources needed to perform this
function.



14
KNDE *Cted as intermediary both between the State and IBRO and
between thbs And the Moroccan comeercial banks.  It helped to resolve certain
problems, of wbich the main ones were detailed in the study it made with the
Ministry of Finance in February 1985.
In the course of the project BNDE provided all sorts of financial,
economic and technical assistance to all the partners in the system
established.
To sum up, the State-tURD-BNDE collaboration made it possible to set
up a very original financing procedure, by means of which the banks were
induced to start financing SSIs. The SSI subsector is currently receiving the
benefits of a set of specific financing procedures.
8.        DEVELOPMELNT OF THE MCBILIZATION OF LOAN 2038-NOR
As of December 31, 1987, commitment requtests addressed to IBRD
related to 514 investment projects which received ON 262 million in direct
credits in conjunction with rediscountable credits totaling DS 130 million.
This assistance generated investments aggregating 0R 638 million, enabling
creation of 17,266 jobs once fully operational and the maintaining of a
further 198.
B.1  INCREASE IN COMIITMENT REQUESTS
We give below the breakdown by year of commitment requests:
No. of    Investments      Direct    Rediscountable             Jobs

1984      74         75,097,000   32,716,000   16,353,000           2525       87
1985      94        113,034,000   48,075,500   24,030,000           2481        i4

1987     140        210,343,000   83,674,000   41,572,000           6032       23
TOTAL    514        637,917,663  262,138,562  129,706,088          17266       198
The above figures show that the number of projects and direct
credits grew by 22% and 342 on average per year, respectively, during the
period 1983-87. The pace of this Increasa quickened as of 1985, the year in
which the above-mentioned measures were put into effect.



15
It should be noted that 732 of the projects and 772 of ihe credits
were pogted between 196S and 1987, which is evidence of a special effort by
both the CO =0 cial banks and BNDt in those three years.
Rowever, the considerable increase in commitments in dichams was
offset somewhat by the apprecidtion of the U.S. dollar, the average rate for
which rose from DH 7.46 in 1983 to DOH8.64 in L984 then soared to OH 9.94 in
1985. On the other hand, the rate for the dollar averaged DR 9.06 in 1986,
then dropped to Di 8.22 on average in 1987.
Expressed in U.S. dollars, commitments increased by 32% per year
over the period 1983-87, as shown in the following tab:e:
1983     1984      1985     1986      1987
Commitment requests (x ON 1000)    26,484   32,716   48,076   71,189   83,674
Comitment requests (x US$1000)        3,549    3,788    4,836    7,858   10,183
Average exchange rate for USS          7.46      8.64     9.94      9.06      8.22
Moreover, as a result of the favorable trend in approvals and the
relative fall in the rate for the dollar, 601 of the commitments were made in
the last two years (1986-87).
82 WITHDRAWALS (situatlon as of M4ay 29, 1989)
Withdr'wals increased appreciably over the years, as is apparent
from the followitcg table:
Year                                 Amounts Withdrawn (US$1)

Tbe $urge between 1983 and 1984 was exceptf,nal and was due to the
buildup of applications owing to the delay in setti.. ap the line.
1110 poSf@rmance achieved since 1986, an the other hand, is the
result of tho effort made by BNDE to make the commercial banks aware of the
need to speed withdrawals together with the easing of the investment
requirements as of 1985.
The requirements in question related to the two items for which it
is most difficult to produce justification, namely construction and
development costs and working capital costs; the relaxations introduced
consisted of establishment of quantity surveying for the former and r!lease of
the proportion relating to the latter after completion of the physical program.
It must nevertheless be noted that the question of justification of
expenditures remains a problem for SSIs in Morocco.
The fact is that despite all the relaxations introduced and
notwithstanding the various extensions of the closing date for withdrawal
requests, ultimately set at March 31, 1989, the unused balaine as of that date
had to be cancelled. This balanee was of the order of US$3,545,411 (IBRD
telex of April 11, 1989) and rep.esented 11.82 of the loan. By way of
comparison, the cancelled balance of the f .rst SSI loan, No. 1687-MOR, was 32S.
C.   CONCLUSIONS
The Second Small-Scale Industries Project, Loan 2038-MOR, made it
possible to finance some 500 subprojects and to create about 17,000 jobs.
Eleven banks participated in the project.
This project encountered a number of problems, most of which have
been overcome. Its implementation took longer than originally expected, but
as a result many lessons were learned. Thanks to the project, the different
agencies and organizations concerned are now able to operate the SSI financing
system more efficiently.
In addition, the terms and conditions governing execution of SSI
projects have been improved compared with those applicable to projects
financed under the first loan, which demonstrates the attention that is being
paid to SSIs.
A large number of administrative requirements have been eased and
several financing procedures specific to SSIs have been created. Through this
second project, IBRD has made the banks aware of the value of ssr financing.
BNDE, being experienced in this form of financing, was also able to mobilize
other lines of credit at the same time.
