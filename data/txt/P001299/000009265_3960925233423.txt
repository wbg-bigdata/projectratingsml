MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF KENYA
FOR A SECOND RAILWAY PROJECT
1.       The following report on a proposed credit to Kenya for SDR 21.8
million (US$28.0 million equivalent) is submitted for approval.  The
proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms and help finance training
and technical assistance and urgently needed equipment and spare parts for
Kenya Railways Corporation (KR). Except for expenditures for technical
assistance which would be passed through to KR on IDA terms, the Government
would onlend the proceeds of the credit to KR at a rate 10% higher than the
Bank rate. A grace period of four years and a final maturity of 20 years
would apply to credit repayment. KR would bear the foreign exchange risk.
A subsidiary loan agreement incorporating the above terms and acceptable to
IDA would be a condition of credit effectiveness. ODA would provide
cofinancing of about UK£&.0 million (US$13.3 million equivalent).
2.       Background.  Kenya's transport system is well developed and fairly
efficient. Primary transport arteries include a railway, a network of main
national roads and an oil pipeline between Mombasa and Nairobi. Inland
water transport is of little significance. Aircraft carry largely high
value freight and tourists. The road and the railiqay run parallel in a
corridor stretching from the port of Mombasa to the Ugandan border, roughly
1,000 km in length. The corridor is of major economic importance, serving
over half of Kenya's population and much of its agricultural and commer.ial
activity. Efficient, thriving and largely private, Kenya's road transport
industry has captured an increasingly large share of the total freight
transport market (55% in 1978 and an estimated 65% in 1986), including the
long-haul business, while rail is less aggressive and suffers from a lack
of motive power availability. Over half of the freight carried originates
at Mombasa's well-equipped deep water port. The largest share of imports
are carried by road, even though rail rates are substantially lower than
trucking charges.
3.       Rail nevertheless remains vital to Kenya's economy, carrying
annually over 3.5 million tons of freight for an average length of haul of
over 500 km. The railway once handled substantially more freight but lost
about a half million tons of petroleum products to the pipeline which was
opened in 1978, and roughly another 1 million tons of transit traffic to
Uganda with the down turn of the Uganda economy during the 1970's and the
break-up of the East African Community in 1978. This also resulted in
delays for goods in transit caused by documentation and procedures for
border crossing. The transport facilities in the Mombasa-Uganda border
corridor are not only the backbone of Kenya's transport system, but are of
vital importance to the landlocked countries of East Central Africa as
well: Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, Southern Sudan and Eastern Zaire. Since
rail is by far the most economic mode of transport for bulk commodities,
growth in KR's transit traffic would contribute to the economic development
of the inland countries as well as benefit KR. Cooperation between these
countries, which are associated in the Northern Corridor Transport
Agreement of 1985, will facilitate transit traffic. This Agreement was
ratified by Kenya and by Burundi, Rwanda, and Uganda in 1986. In addition,
in 1985, Kenya Railways and Uganda Railways negotiated an agreement which
has helped integrate their operations.

4.       Government's transport policy is generally sound, but its weak
implementation has led to high road transport costs because of past
inadequate road maintenance and vehicle overloading. Insufficient road
user taxation has caused inappropriate traffic distribution between road
and rail. In line with agreements reached under the Second Highway Sector
Project, the Government has increased road user charges and improved axle
load controls. The railway has suffered from Government intervention in
tariff setting and in requiring KR to provide uneconomic services without
compensation. The resulting financial problems, combined with operating
and manpower inefficiencies and insufficient locomotive availability, have
severely undermined the railway's ability to fulfill its potential economic
role. Between 1980 and 1986, motive power availability declined from 64%
to 55% and freight traffic declined at 4.1X p.a., while total staff
increased from 21,534 to 23,235. KR reported operating losses in each year
except 1984. Efforts to address these problems under the First Railways
Pro,ect (Loan 1976-KE) resulted in only temporary improvements, mainly
because the major structural changes needed for KR to compete successfully
were not fully appreciated at the time. After much study and deliberation,
Government has recently endorsed a Corporate Plan for KR that includes
measures to enable KR to compete commercially and to strengthen it
institutionally and financially.
5.       Prolect Obiectives.  The major objective of the proposed project
would be to initiate a process of institutional, financial and structural
reform of the railway to enable KR to adapt to its Increasingly competitive
environment. In the short term, the project aims to reverse KR's
deteriorating performance through the provision of technical assistance,
appropriate training, and essential equipment and spare parts to help
overcome the lack of motive power.
6.       Prolect Description.  The project would comprise key elements of
the Corporate Plan including the following: (i) Institutional Development
- reorientation of KR's organizational structure and management toward more
commercial practices, introduction of appropriate management skills, and
human resource development; (ii) Increased Motive Power - through the
purchase of locomotive spare parts, workshop restructuring, improved
locomotive repair and maintenance, and training; and (iii) Improved Train
Operations - through organizational changes, provision of maintenance
equipment, and technical assistance to introduce efficient traffic
management.
7.       The total cost of the project is estimazed at US$45.5 million,
with a foreign exchange component of US$37.2 million (82%). The project is
exempt from taxes and duties. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan
are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and
disbursement are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key processing events
and the status of Bank Group operations in Kenya are given in Schedules C
and D, respectively. A map of Kenya is attached. The Staff Appraisal
Report, No. 5887-KE dated May 14, 1987, is being distributed separately.
8.       Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The First Railway Project sought
to make the transport sector more cost effective by increasing KR's
capacity and by helping in the preparation of corrective measures to
address the fundamental problems in KR's managerial structure and operating
performance. The studies undertaken in the First Railway Project confirmed
that the comparative cost advantage of the railways cannot be fully
exploited unless: (i) the framework within which the railway operates is
significantly improved; and (ii) the railway itself becomes more



- 3 -
commercially oriented. The proposed project arose from these studies and
focuses on meeting these needs. It is, therefore, in line with the Bank
Group's country strategy which is to use sector lending to: (i) support
the Government in adopting and implementing policy reforms that will lead
to economic efficiency; (ii) achieve institutional development; and (iii)
improve the operating performance of parastatals.
9.       Agreed Actions.  KR's new Corporate Plan was reviewed by IDA staff
and found satisfactory. At negotiations, agreement was reached on the main
features of the Plan, including: (i) limitation of railway investments by
KR larger than US$500,000 for other than this and other ongoing projects;
(ii) KR's key Performance Targets, including financial covenants as
follows: take all necessary measures including tariff adjustments to
achieve in the fiscal year beginning July 1, 1988 a working ratio of not
more than 80% followed by 75% in 1989 ani 1990 and 70% in 1991 and
thereafter, a ratio of current assets to current liabilities of not less
than 2.0:1 in 1988 and 1989 and 2.5:1 thereafter, and a ratio of debt to
equity of not more than 55:45 in 1988 and thereafter; (iii) Government's
compensation payments to KR for services required by the Government which
cannot be commercially operated; and (iv) Government's facilitation of
prompt procurement of spare parts and equipment. The execution of a
subsidiary loan agreement satisfactory to IDA is a condition of credit
effectiveness.
10.      Justification.  The main economic benefits of this project are
expected to be savings in transportation costs. KR would capture more bulk
freight traffic than it could carry without the project, at a lower cost
than road transporters.   The improved policy framework and management
skills to enable KR to operate commercially; the increases in motive power
availability through the timely provision of spares and improved mechanical
maintenance; and improved train operations and maintenance of way are
expected to result in a more efficient modal split. The introduction
through this project of more clearly defined relations between Government
and the railway will contribute to improve the management of parastatals in
Kenya. The overall econom%c rate of return of the project is calculated at
20%.
11.      Risks.  The major risk is that the projected increase in rail
traffic fails to materialize because of insufficient Government support for
the Corporate Plan or ineffective use of technical assistance by KR. Over
two years have been invested between the first formulation of an Action
Plan for KR and project start-up to ensure broad understanding of and
support for the project at Government and railway's level: The intensity
and thoroughness of this effort should mi igate the risk. The sensitivity
analysis shows that, if benefits were 20% lower than projected, the
project's economic rate of return would still be satisfactory at 16%.
12.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
