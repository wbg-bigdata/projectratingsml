SECOND RAILWAY PROJECT
(Cr. 1820-KE)
PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Second Railways
Project in Kenya, for which Credit no. 1820-KE in the amount of SDR 21.8 million
equivalent was approved on June 11, 1987 and made effective on April 19, 1988.
The Credit was closed on June 30, 1995, the original closing date, except for one
component, viz., the telecommunications package, which was given an extension up to
December 31, 1995 in view of its vital bearing on safety in train operations. Final
disbursement took place on January 25, 1996, at which time a balance of SDR 2,142,147.93
was canceled. Co-financing for the project was provided by ODA.
The ICR was prepared by Messrs. S. S. Nayak and Simon Thomas of the Energy and
Infrastructure Operations Division (AF2EI) of the Africa Region and reviewed by Mr.
Stephen Weissman, Chief, AF2EI and Mr. Surendra Agarwal, Projects Adviser, AF2DR.
Preparation of this ICR was begun during the Bank's Implementation Completion
Mission in July 1995. It is based on materials in the project file. The borrower contributed to
preparation of the ICR by preparing own evaluation of the project's execution and initial
preparation.

EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
1. The main components of Kenya's land transport system consist of a railway, a network of main
and secondary classified roads, and an oil pipeline from Mombasa to Eldoret and Kisumu. Kenya
Railways (KR), a government-owned parastatal organization, is a single track meter gauge system of
2085 route km, made up of 1085 km of main line and 1014 km of branch lines. The road transport
industry is privately owned and is in aggressive competition with the railway. The Bank Group made
a number of loans and credits to transport institutions of the East African Community, before its
break-up in 1977. Since then, there have been four investment projects in the transport sector; all these
have been completed: the First Highway Sector Project (Loan 1694-KE of 1979); the First Railway
Project (Loan 1976-KE of 1981); the Second Highway Sector Project (Loan 2409-KE of 1984); and
the subject of this ICR, the Second Railway Project (Credit 1820-KE of 1987) for which ODA was
the co-financing agency. The Third Highway Sector Project is in the preparation stage of the project
cycle. The Nairobi - Mombasa Road Rehabilitation Project was approved by the Board on January
30, 1996.
Project Objectives
2. The objectives of the project were: (i) achieving the needed organizational restructuring and
greater commercial orientation on KR; and (ii) revitalizing KR's operational performance. The
objectives were clear and unambiguous, and at the same time, they left sufficient room for flexibility
in project implementation. They were in line with the Country Assistance Strategy. The
Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed between GOU and KR in April 1989 provided for
KR's commercial autonomy and compensation payments to KR for obligatory non-commercial
services and for costs of excess staff resulting from policy constraints, and was intended to promote
and facilitate the objectives of the project. However, the cultural change required by the first objective
was very demanding in the economic environment prevailing in the earlier stages of the project. The
second objective aimed at improving financial results and reducing costs by improving KR's
operations, primarily by actions to address weaknesses in locomotive maintenance and operational
planning.
Implementation Experience and Results
3. Significant success was achieved in the first objective of institutional and organizational
development with respect to restructuring and commercialization of KR during the latter half of the
project period. Freight tariff autonomy was achieved and cost-related tariffs and contracted freight
services introduced; minor stations were closed to commercial freight operations; steps were taken
towards separation of passenger and freight services; some loss-making passenger services were
terminated; private sector participation in equipment maintenance was introduced, and initiatives
towards private sector operation of trains on KR lines were taken. With a retrenchment and voluntary
retirement scheme financed from sale of surplus land to supplement natural staff attrition, the staffing
complement fell from 22,050 to 17,300 during the project. (Pt. I 3). These significant and impressive
achievements have a high probability of being sustained in the present liberalized economic
environment in Kenya, especially since KR will be assisted by inputs from the Parastatal Reform and
Privatization Project (Cr. 2440-KE).(Pt. I: 39, 40). With respect to operational performance, however,
the project failed to attain its objective and freight traffic fell substantially in the latter half of the



- iii -
project owing, primarily, to poor locomotive availability and reliability and towards the end of the
project, to poor wagon availability. Business initiatives could not be sustained owing to severely
constrained operational capacity. (Pt. I: 5).
4. The actual costs, compared to the estimates were as follows (in eq. US$ millions):
Source of financing     Estimated cost      Actual Cost
I.D.A.                   28,000,000       26,369,246
O.D.A.                   13,300,000       13,100,000
KR                        4.200.000         646.200
TOTAL                    45,500,000       42,115,446
5. The Project was closed on June 30, 1995, the original closing date, except for one component,
viz., the telecommunications package, for which an extension upto December 31, 1995 was agreed to
at the request of GOK / KR in view of its vital bearing on operations safety.
6. Factors affecting achievement of the Restructuring Objective:  At the start of the project,
GOK retained its control over KR tariffs. It was in 1991, after the informal suspension by the Bank of
new commitments under the Credit, that KR was given tariff autonomy. KR showed hesitancy in
submitting compensation claims and all loss-making services were not covered; nor did GOK settle
all the claims made. The important successes in restructuring ( vide para 4 above) were achieved
during the latter half of the project, when the economic environment and the attitudes of GOK and KR
changed. (Pt. I: 7 to 12)
7. Factors affecting achievement of the Operational Performance Objective: (i) Motive
power availability and reliability dropped during the project, inspite of major inputs (US$ 18.7 million
from IDA, and UK£ 3.2 million from ODA) for spares and rehabilitation. Wagon availability also
became a constraint at a later stage. Annual freight traffic rose from 3.08 million Tons in FY 1988 to
3.55 million Tons in FY1990, but then collapsed to 2.23 million Tons in FY1994 and 2.14 million
Tons in FYI 995. Underlying causes are: the continued atrophy of essential systems of maintenance
management on KR, poor inter-departmental coordination, poor identification and prioritization of
spares ordered in large lots, ordering of critical spares from unreliable sources, and incorrect technical
decisions leading to equipment damage. (Pt. I: 13 to 17). (ii) There were, however, improvements in
train operations planning and crew productivity. Facilities for improved train operations - yard
fueling facilities for locomotives, aircompressors (released from locomotives undergoing
modifications) for pre-testing brake power of trains, ballast hopper wagons for track maintenance, and
local communications facilities in the Nairobi and Mombasa complexes - were provided. (Pt. 1: 19 to
26). (iii) The benefits from a very substantial component of Technical Assistance (235 man months
financed by IDA and 493 man months by ODA) have been, with a few exceptions, far from
impressive. The large and concentrated volume of TA could not be absorbed by KR managers, who
also lacked strong positive ownership of the program. The lack of field orientation of some of the TA
personnel, the reluctance of both KR and the donors to replace ineffective TA, and the hiatus in the
management processes on KR. during the Presidential Inquiry of 1989 have also contributed to this
failure. (Pt. 1: 32, 33). (iv) KR could be described as technically insolvent at the end of the project
with its short term liabilities greatly exceeding its available assets. Large arrears of interest and
principal repayments have accumulated and a major financial restructuring will be required to re-
establish KR's financial position. The rapid depreciation of the K Sh. has played a substantial role in
the deteriorating financial position of KR which bears the foreign exchange risk for most of its loans.



- lv -
This has been compounded by the poor operating performance of KR which has constrained
revenues.(Pt. : 28 to 31).
8. Performance of the Bank:  The Project correctly attempted to address weaknesses in the
organization of KR, in its relationship with GOK, and in the equipment maintenance function. The
design of the substantial TA component should, however, have taken into account the ownership
issue, and KR's absorptive capacity. The needed flexibility within the Project scope was exercised in
response to the changing needs of KR in the latter half of the Project. Advice tendered during
supervision missions helped KR and GOK to decide eventually on the changes needed in the
restructuring process, and in identifying weaknesses and addressing them. The Bank's action in the
informal suspension in approving new commitments under the Project, while it did affect the pace of
procurement to some extent, accelerated the granting of tariff autonomy to KR. The Bank could,
however, have taken a more active stand when it was clear that T. A. was ineffective.(Pt. I:41)
9. Performance of the Borrower: In the earlier part of project implementation, in the then
prevailing economic environment when all parastatals were still controlled and directed by GOK,
there was reluctance to grant effective commercial autonomy to KR. There was also significant
resistance to change within KR. Later on in the project, there was a noticeable change in outlook and
attitudes, and the pace of restructuring picked up. Major weaknesses continued in KR Mechanical
Maintenance and Supplies Management. Inter-departmental coordination was not effective. KR
showed no enthusiasm to make effective use of the TA inputs. In the final years of the Project, there
were delays in processing Payment Applications through MOTC, MOF and CBK, adversely affecting
receipts of supplies.(Pt. I: 42)
10. There was no positive economic return from the project. The overall outcome of the project is
assessed as "unsatisfactory" (Pt.I: 43).
Summary of Findings, Future Operations and Key Lessons Learned
i 1. The project resulted in significant institutional development on KR, but also demonstrated major
weaknesses in equipment maintenance and supplies management. Radical restructuring of these
functions, including a major role for the private sector, is necessary for KR's commercial survival.
KR's future operations plan takes into account the initiatives under the Parastal Reform and
Privatization Project covering the aspects of corporate governance, further staff rationalization,
separation of business centers, and major restructuring by contracting out of equipment maintenance.
12. Lessons Learned from the Project: (i) The borrower's commitment to major structural change
needs to be positively demonstrated before commencing project implementation; in this case, the
MOU remained a statement of good intentions till the mid-part of project implementation;(ii)
important institutional problems, (like, in this case, the locomotive maintenance delivery system) need
to be addressed with fundamental reform which could include involvement of the private sector; (iii)
client ownership of TA, periodical evaluation of TA performance and its linkage with absorption
capacity are essential for success; (iv) arrival of TA personnel need to be synchronized with
availability of inputs like spares; (v) spares procurement should be in manageable tranches, take into
account the need for proprietary sources for critical items, and be done by a specialized agency, in
case in-house expertise is inadequate; and (vi) equipment specification should emphasize proven
experience in a similar working environment (Pt. 1 45 to 47).

SECOND RAILWAY PROJECT
(Credit 1820 - KE)
PART I - PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A.  STATEMENT / EVALUATION OF OBJECTIVES
1. Objectives
1.1    The project objectives were: (a) achieving needed organizational restructuring and more
commercially oriented managerial skills on KR; and (b) revitalizing KR's operational performance.
2. Evaluation of Objectives
2.1    The primary transport infrastructure in Kenya includes the railway, a network of national
roads and an oil pipeline from Mombasa to Eldoret (Nairobi during the formulation of the project).
The Mombasa - Uganda border corridor is not only the backbone of Kenya's transport system, but is
of vital importance to the landlocked countries of Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi and (Eastern) Zaire. The
project objectives were intended to support GOK efforts to lower transportation costs and remove
transport constraints by promoting efficiency in the railway system and help KR realize its economic
role as a bulk long haul carrier. GOK was also simultaneously acting in the roads sub-sector through
the Second Highways Sector Project (Ln. 2409-KE), which aimed at improving the condition of the
road network, enhancing capacity for planning, administration and coordination, and instituting an
appropriate regulatory environment. The project objectives were in line with the Association's
Country Assistance Strategy.
2.2.   The first objective called for a change in the organizational culture and orientation from the
erstwhile traditional state-owned, state-controlled entity to a commercially oriented autonomous
parastatal entity. This far reaching change demanded a lot from the borrower (GOK) as well as the
implementing agency (KR) in the earlier stages of project implementation in the then prevailing
economic environment. The second project objective was directed towards eliminating constraints to
efficiency in KR's operational planning and standard of locomotive maintenance revealed during the
First Railway Project (Ln. 1976-KE). The objectives were appropriate, clear and unambiguous. They
also left room for flexibility in project implementation.
B.  ACHIEVEMENT OF OBJECTIVES
3.     Very significant success was achieved in the first objective of institutional and organizational
development in terms of restructuring and commercialization. Project achievements are:



- 2 -
(i) establishment of the Business & Operations Division; (ii) preparation of KR's Corporate Plan and
its periodic updating; (iii) freight tariff autonomy for KR; (iv) introduction of Traffic Costing
Systems and cost-related tariffs; (v) substantial use of contracted freight services; (vi) closing of
stations with minor commercial significance to commercial operations; (vii) focus on block train
operations; (viii) improvements in the budgeting system; (ix) first steps towards separation of
passenger services from freight services; (x) commencement of a major staff rationalization exercise;
(xi) introduction of private sector (customer) participation in wagon repairs; (xii) hiring of
locomotives from a private company, including their maintenance services; and (xiii) steps towards
private sector operation of trains on KR lines (Magadi Soda).
4.     The early years of project implementation were marked by hesitancy towards change. In the
highly regulated economic environment, it was not easy for major changes within a parastatal entity,
or in the government's attitude towards it. It was in the later years, as the economic environment itself
started changing that most of the above achievements took place.
5.     In respect of operational performance, however, the project failed to attain its objective;
freight traffic fell substantially in the latter half of the project owing, primarily, to poor locomotive
availability and reliability. Towards the end of the project, the wagon availability also became a
constraining factor. Business initiatives could not be sustained owing to severely constrained system
capacities. The first two years of the project provided a promise of success with increasing freight
traffic, but this was the result of increased capacity from the recently acquired locomotives; as they
grew older and needed maintenance and overhauls, motive power capacity commenced to fall, and
this trend could not be arrested.
6.     Since the traffic levels actually fell during the project, calculation of the Economic Rate of
Return is of academic interest only and does not serve any useful purpose.
C.  IMPLEMENTATION RECORD AND MAJOR FACTORS
AFFECTING THE PROJECT
Part A of the Project: Restructuring and Institutional Development
7.     The thrust towards restructuring of KR - GOK relations was based on the Memorandum of
Understanding (MOU), of April 1989 and valid for five years thereafter. It provided for (i) KR's tariff
autonomy; (ii) compensation payments to KR for GOK- mandated non-commercial services and costs
of excess staff resulting from policy constraints; (iii) timely provision of foreign exchange for KR's
needs; (iv) GOK facilitation of payment of debts by other parastatal entities to KR; and (v) KR's
undertaking to achieve specified performance targets.
8.     Initially, KR still had to obtain GOK approval for tariff increases and there were serious
delays in approval of KR's tariff revision proposals. When it became clear that tariff autonomy had
not been achieved, the Bank had to intervene by the informal suspension of approval of new
commitments under the Credit, which lasted for nine months. Ultimately in 1991, KR was given the
freedom to set its tariffs without prior GOK approval. KR lodged its first compensation claim in April
1991 to cover the shortfall in revenue occasioned by delays in approval of tariff revision proposals
and losses in the operation of the Nairobi commuter services. GOK paid KR K Sh. 100 million and
adjusted the balance of K Sh. 291.25 million towards KR's debt servicing obligations. The second
claim made in 1992 by KR for losses on the Nairobi commuter services for K Sh. 71.09 million was
settled by GOK in a similar manner. KR also tried suspending the commuter services but had to
resume them on a directive from GOK. The third claim for K Sh. 265 million for losses on passenger



- 3 -
services lodged in 1993 was not paid by GOK. Throughout the life of the MOU, KR did not lodge any
claims for non-remunerative branch line operation, or for the lake marine services for lack of
adequate confidence in the costing systems, which were enhanced towards the close of the project.
9.     The pace of staff rationalization accelerated towards the end of the project with a voluntary
retirement scheme, as well as a retrenchment scheme, which is being financed from the sale of surplus
railway land. KR's staffing level declined as follows: (*: Planned)
Year-->       88      89     90      91     92     93      94     95      (12/96)*
Number (000)  22.05  21.65  21.13  20.62  20.91   19.66  18.96  17.30  (14.50)
10.    In the last year of the project, KR started the exercise of separation of passenger services
from freight services with a study financed by the Swedish Trust Fund, and Technical Assistance
financed from the Credit. The accounts had been separated by June 1995, and the setting up of the
Passenger Services Division is to follow.
11.    The Training component of the project had to be abandoned and the funds transferred to
locomotive spares, which had priority as a matter of survival for KR. Proposals for twinning
arrangements with a well established railway training school overseas reached the stage of the TOR,
but, with the financing of locomotive spares claiming priority, the proposal was kept in abeyance. The
Credit financed a study for preparing plans and estimates for modemizing the Training School. This
work now awaits future financing. The training school, however, continued its in-house training
program, with more emphasis since 1992 on management training and specialized courses in
maintenance of diesel locomotives.
12.    It was during the last two years of the project's life, that KR achieved most of the significant
restructuring actions and institutional advances listed above. The reasons for this were a combination
of: (i) the changing economic environment in the country which provided a more favorable
environment for such actions; (ii) KR's response to the increasing crisis in its operations; and (iii)
persistent encouragement from the financing agencies.
Part B of the project: Motive Power:
13.    Motive Power availability, which stood at 53.9% reckoned on 219 locomotives at the
beginning of the project fell to 52% reckoned on 156 locomotives at its close. The arrival of the 10
new locomotives just before the project commenced increased motive power capacity for a time, but
soon the availability of all locomotives, including the new ones, dropped, seriously affecting traffic
levels. The reliability was also very low, ranging between 8158 kms. between failures at the start of
the project, and 3143 kms. at its close.
14.    The major financial input into the project was in terms of locomotive spares on which US$
18.7 million were provided from the IDA credit, and UK£ 3.2 million for locomotive rehabilitation
from ODA financing. This very sizable input had no appreciable impact on the locomotive problem.
The underlying causes were:
(i)    the continued atrophy of essential systems of maintenance management, monitoring
and failure analysis, which was repeatedly pointed out in Supervision Missions, and
which KR has tried to rectify in the concluding years of the Project;



- 4 -
(ii)   the large number of locomotives damaged in collisions and accidents caused by
human operational errors; at the end of the project there were 20 locomotives
awaiting accident repairs. KR set up an effective Accident Investigation Unit with
TA under the project which resulted in a significant reduction in the incidence of line
derailments till 1993, but with an increasing trend thereafter, indicative of a drop in
maintenance standards.
(iii)   poor coordination between the Maintenance and Supplies Departments in prioritizing
and ordering of the spares;
(iv)   mistakes in identification of the requirement of spares in the first two lots ($16.4
million, with over 2000 items in the lists for each of the lots) undertaken
independently by the Mechanical Department; (the third and fourth lots of spares,
procured on an emergency basis in the latter half of the Project were listed after
detailed scrutiny by an inter-departmental Task Force of KR);
(v)    all the spares in the first two lots being procured under ICB, without regard to the
criticality of their application on the locomotives and the absence of inspection at
source (even though KR has this option under the contracts), leading to some fake
spares being received, which in turn, led to major equipment failures with heavy
consequential damage and the setting aside of such stocks of spares. KR did not avail
of the clause in the Credit Agreement for proprietary spares to be procured directly
from the original manufacturers, even though this provision was brought to their
attention by Bank supervision missions.
(vi)   the very large ($ 12.3 million) first order for spares. A judiciously tranched
procurement could have led to better prioritization;
(vii)  the expectation when preparing the spares lists, that consumable spares would be
procured with KR's own funds which, in the event, were insufficient for the purpose;
(viii)  in the last year of the project, the delays experienced in passing payment applications
through MOTC, MOF and CBK affecting the timely procurement of spares and
equipment; and
(ix)    some erroneous technical decisions, like the use of fuel filters in place of lube oil
filters, leading to large scale damage to engine assemblies.
15.    The result of (iii) to (vi) the above is a situation at the end of the project when only 62 % of
the spares procured have been used, with the remaining 38 % still in the Stores, in the face of a
continuing acute scarcity of essential spares for locomotive maintenance.
16.    In the last year of the Project, KR hired 10 locomotives from Spoomet (South Africa) to
augment the motive power capacity. This, however, has not produced an increase in traffic, because
of: (i) wagon capacity having become a major constraint with availability levels falling to around 50
%; and (ii) the loss of some traditional customers who were neglected in favour of the emergency
food movements in 1994. It has, however, opened the eyes of KR's management to the advantages of
private sector participation in locomotive maintenance.



17.    Five 87 class locomotives were rehabilitated and six 71/72 class locomotives were
overhauled under the ODA-financed component of the project. The performance of these locomotives
could not, however, be sustained because of the interchange of sub-assemblies between the
rehabilitated / overhauled locomotives and the remainder of the fleet. KR also had problems in
maintaining the rehabilitated locomotives due to causes explained in paragraph 14.
18.    Wagon capacity was not a significant problem during formulation of the project, but the
continued scarcity of finance for essential spares and dwindling workshop out-turn of repaired
wagons led to a crisis. The matter was highlighted during a Supervision Mission in early 1994, and
since then, KR has instituted an incentive system in workshops, which has led to a significant increase
in the output from the workshops. Unfortunately, this has not been reflected in significant
improvement in overall availability levels which stood at 58% in June 1995.
Part C of the project: Operational Improvements
19.    The most significant aspect of improvements in train planning and operations has been the
increase in the number of point-to-point block trains and the elimination of commercial freight
operations at all stations except 23 commercially significant stations, leading to improvement in
transit times. Wagon turnaround has shown improvement, but not to the levels anticipated during
project formulation.
20.    Crew productivity has improved with the commissioning of the Running Room at Mtito-
Andei under the project. Nairobi-Mombasa trains no longer carry a caboose for a duplicate set of
crew, thus increasing the effective train capacity and reducing the incidence of stabling of trains en
route on account of excessive crew hours.
21.    Locomotive fueling facilities were constructed at Nakuru, Voi, Eldoret and Mombasa under
the project, increasing flexibility in motive power planning and operations. The fueling facility at
Kisumu was, however, abandoned at the foundation stage, when the contractor failed to deliver.
22.    The seven sand drying facilities planned under the project were overly elaborate and not
justified; a simpler system would have been more economical and would have functioned as
effectively. In the event, three of them were dropped after a review of the locomotive operating and
maintenance strategies, and in the rest, only the buildings were constructed and the elaborate
equipment planned by KR was not installed, and sand is being dried naturally at these sites.
23.    The planned provision of new air compressors for testing of air brakes on locomotives and
wagons was substituted by the provision of compressors released from 92 class locomotives
consequent to modifications on the locomotives. This was a cost-effective solution.
24.    23 ballast hopper wagons and three front end ballast loaders were acquired by KR under
financing from ODA; these have served KR well in track ballasting. The 20 tallow wagons, also
procured with ODA financing are in service.
25.    KR acquired a mobile on-track flash butt welder with financing from the Credit. This
machine has not functioned effectively, and KR has had innumerable problems with it right from its
arrival. During nearly five years, only 50 km of KR's track has been welded with the machine. This
machine was a one-off prototype for a metre gauge system.
26.    VHF radio sets in the Nairobi and Mombasa railway complexes and five telephone exchanges
were acquired by KR with ODA financing. These are in effective use, except for problems with the



- 6 -
VHF sets on shunting locomotives. For telecommunications West of Nairobi, a study proposed a
capital-intensive system for which no financing was available. In the final stages of the Project, the
situation became critical and an Emergency Telecommunications project was started, with financing
from the Credit. In view of the critical need of the system in the interests of safety of train operations,
IDA agreed to the request of KR /GOK to keep this component alone open for disbursements till
December 31, 1995. However, the work was only partially completed by that date.
27.    Operational performance could not be very significantly improved during the project,
principally due to the poor availability and reliability of locomotives. Physical transport capacity was
severely constrained. Passenger services had to be drastically curtailed. The trend of traffic through
put during the Project was as follows:

Financial Performance
28.    Overall Financial Position: The financial position of KR at the end of the project could be
described as technically insolvent with its short term liabilities greatly exceeding its available assets.
Accumulated arrears of interest and principal repayments have reached almost K Sh. 7 billion and a
major financial restructuring is required if KR's financial position is to be re-established. The rapid
depreciation of the Ksh has played a substantial role in the deteriorating financial position of KR
which bears the foreign exchange risk for most of its loans. The impact of the depreciating Ksh has
been compounded by the poor operating performance of KR which has constrained revenues. Key
Financial Indicators for the period 1987-95 are at Table 6.
29.    Revenues: (i) KR is basically a freight railway (freight revenue has risen from about 81% of
total revenue in FY88 to 89% in FY95) and its overall revenue position is dependent upon both its
freight traffic and tariffs. Freight tariffs, during the project period, essentially kept pace with the rate
of general inflation in the economy except in FY94 when the K Sh value of US$ denominated freight
rates increased substantially with the depreciation of the Ksh and average revenue per ton-km
increased by 58% compared an inflation rate of 29%. KR has been able to utilize fully its tariff
autonomy and is now only constrained by market conditions, as illustrated by the tariff reductions
necessary in FY95. (ii) KR's major revenue problem has been its inability to maintain its freight
capacity since FY90; by FY94, freight traffic had declined by over 35%, from almost 2 billion ton-
kms to 1.28 billion ton-kms. KR is now carrying only about 50% of the freight traffic forecast when
the project was developed. It is very difficult to envisage a long term commercial future for KR
unless freight traffic can be substantially increased above its present levels; even with freight traffic
growing to almost 4 million tonnes, financial restructuring is necessary. (iii) Passenger tariffs also
rose, on average, to reflect inflation but the tariff adjustments have been more erratic. The volume of
passenger traffic has, however, halved over the project period.
30.    Expenditures: (i) Increases in operational expenses, on average, have been held well below
the rate of inflation although there has been a pattern of strict control of expenditure in some periods
followed by significant increases in subsequent years. The only exception to slow expenditure growth



- 7 -
has been traffic expenses which have increased very substantially since FY90, reflecting the
increasing cost of diesel and the imposition of full taxation. Traffic expenses over the period have
increased from less than 20% of working expenses to almost 35%. (ii) The cost savings that achieved
by increased efficiency are limited without major shifts in operating practices and service provision.
Some of the expenditure control has been achieved by disinvestment in the essential assets of KR
through inadequate maintenance of track, motive power and rolling stock. If FY87 expenditure levels
reflected adequate maintenance of these assets, there has been a shortfall of expenditure, over the
project period, of over Ksh 2 billion (FY94 price levels) for track maintenance and about Ksh 850
million for motive power and rolling stock maintenance. The deterioration in track conditions and
the low levels of availability reflect the inadequate maintenance. (iii) Staff costs have been reduced
from over 50% of working expenses to about 34%. There was a steady attrition in staff numbers over
the project period, down from over 22,000 at the end of FY88 to 17,300 at the end of FY95. The
major contribution to the containment of staff costs has been, however, the limitations on wage and
salary levels; real wage/salary costs have halved over the project period. While expedient in the short
term, this fall in real income levels could result in inadequate motivation and an inability to recruit and
retain staff of the quality required.
31.    Financial Outlook: The present financial situation of KR is bleak. If freight traffic is to be
increased on a sustainable basis, the only long term commercial future for KR, increased expenditure
will be required for the maintenance of KR's essential assets. Such increased expenditure will only be
possible through financial restructuring, substantial staff retrenchment, and either the elimination of
KR's non-commercial activities or adequate compensation for their continuation.
Technical Assistance in the Project
32.    The project contained a very substantial component of Technical Assistance in the form of
Advisers ( the initial design of T.A. included experts in key in-line positions, but was modified later)
to almost all departments of KR (235 man-months financed by IDA and 493 man-months financed by
ODA). The benefits flowing from this component have been far from impressive, with a few
exceptions. The design and operation of the T.A. component were deficient in the following aspects:
i the volume of T.A. was large and concentrated within a short period. This magnitude could
not be absorbed by KR officers;
*  commencement of work simultaneously by almost all the T.A. personnel with little prior
preparation by KR and with lack of synchronization with the arrival of inputs like spares;
*  lack of strong positive ownership of the component on the part of KR managers - as a result,
the follow-up of recommendations made by the Advisers was slow and half-hearted; the T.A.
modules were based on initial studies, which were reviewed by the Board of Directors and
agreed upon with the financing agencies, without much involvement and input from the lower
levels of management;
*  the reported lack of field orientation of some of the T. A. personnel, which was also a
weakness with many KR managerial units - this compounded the problem;
*  lack of a formal system of periodical evaluation of Technical Advisers and counterparts
during the functioning of the T.A.; this could have assisted in timely sensing of the problems
and the undertaking of appropriate measures;



- 8 -
*  the hiatus in the management processes and the uncertainty on KR during the Presidential
Inquiry in 1989 and the immediate aftermath thereof, causing considerable loss of effective
time of the Advisers; and
*  reluctance of both KR and the financing agencies to replace ineffective T. A.
33.    Successes of T.A. were recorded in (i) setting up of the Accident Investigation Unit; (ii)
workshop training; (iii) maintenance of 93 class locomotives; and (iv) traffic operations' planning.
The areas where failure was most evident were (i) locomotive maintenance and (ii) supplies
management. A short Emergency Supplies Management Consultancy was organized with financing
from the Credit towards the end of the Project in order to retrieve some lost ground; the
recommendations were under implementation at the end of the Project.
Studies / short consultancies under the Project
34.   IDA-financed Studies / Consultancies:_ (i) Review of KR Catering Services; (ii) Study of
Mau Viaducts; (iii) Asset Revaluation Study; (iv) OSCAR Costing Model; (v) Study of KR
Commercial Scenario; (vi)Staff Retrenchment Program;(vii) Design of Railway Training School
Remodeling; (viii) Emergency Supply Management Program; and (ix) Separation of Passenger
Service Accounts.
35.    ODA-financed Studies / Consultancies: (i) Corporate Planning Study; (ii) Traffic Costing,
with an extension ;(iii) Traffic Costing & Compensation Study; (iv) Software Development Study; (v)
Financial Restructuring Study; (vi) Telecommunications & Signaling Study; and (vii) Drafting of
Performance Contract (GOK -KR)
36.    Other Studies: (i) Marine Services Study (Danida); (ii) Passenger Services Study (Swedish
Trust Fund); (iii) Economic Evaluation of upgrading of Nakuru-Kisumu Line (CIDA) and (iv) KR
Workshops Study (Japanese PHRD grant)
Factors influencing the Implementation Record
37.    External factors were the following: (i) The exchange rate which changed from 16.5 K Sh. /
US$ at the start of the Project to 80 K Sh./US$ in 1993, and down to 50 K Sh./US$ at the end of the
Project. The inflation rates were also much higher than forecast. The abnormally high interest rates on
overdrafts in 1993 also affected KR, whose cash flow needed overdrafts, adversely affected the
financial situation; (ii) The delay and unsatisfactory implementation of the MOU; (iii) Delays in
passing of Payment Applications through MOTC, MOF and CBK towards the close of the Project;
(iv) The imposition of VAT, Customs Duty on imports and the Road Maintenance Levy on diesel fuel
costs - these were not anticipated in the forecasts; the fuel bill alone almost tripled; KR's
competitiveness with road truckers was affected, as reportedly, the VAT on freight was not strictly
enforceable on the latter; (v) Liberalization of transport in Kenya: this adversely affected KR's
haulage of domestic foodgrains and sugar, but KR has managed to gain some petroleum traffic from
the Pipeline Company.
38.   Internal factors within KR which affected project implementation have been dealt within the
preceding paragraphs covering the implementation record.

D.   SUSTAINABILITY OF THE PROJECT
39.    The project successes have been mainly in the institutional and organizational development
fields and have a reasonable probability of being sustained in the prevailing liberalized economic
environment in Kenya KR has initiated important measures, including some private sector
participation in locomotive maintenance. KR's future Operating Plan ( vide # 44 below) takes into
account the inputs from the Parastatal Reform and Privatization Project (Cr. 2440 - KE). Freight
customers of KR have indicated their preference for using the rail mode, provided service efficiency
and reliability are at acceptable levels.
40.    The threats to sustainability are: (i) the continued application of the State Corporations Act
(1986), which, inter alia, regulates staff salaries on KR. KR's staff salaries have not kept pace with
inflation, and the salaries of the higher echelons in management have fared even worse that the other
staff. Skills are draining away from KR, and with no prospect of improvement in remuneration, it will
become worse; (ii) any let up in the initiatives referred to in the section on future operations; (iii)
inadequate attention to operational information systems, which can affect pro-active responses to
situations; and (iv) inau,quate attention to the development of a corporate culture of accountability at
all levels.
E.  BANK PERFORMANCE
41.   Identification and preparation of the project were undertaken by the Bank and ODA jointly
with KR. The project was a sequel to the First Railway Project and addressed weaknesses in the
institution, structure and organization of KR, in its relationship with GOK, and in the equipment
maintenance function identified during the First Railway project. (Ln. 1 976-KE). Supervision
missions were timely and frequent. The supervision style of holding joint meetings with all members
of KR top management as well as meetings and discussions with individual departmental heads and
field visits was found to be effective in identifying and addressing issues. The needed flexibility
within the Project scope was exercised in response to the changing needs of KR, particularly in the
latter half of the Project, when the Emergency Program undertaken at the advice of the donor agencies
helped in (i) reinstating some of the essential maintenance planning and practices; (ii) providing
essentially needed critical spares; (iii) improving workshop output; and (iv) helping KR and GOK to
decide eventually on the changes needed in the restructuring process. The Association's action in the
informal suspension in approving new commitments under the Project accelerated the granting of
tariff autonomy to KR. However, the Association should have taken (i) greater care to ensure KR's
ownership in the design of TA and (ii) a more active stand when it was clear that TA was ineffective;
this could have resulted in more effective capacity building, as well as physical results on KR.
F.  BORROWER PERFORMANCE
42.    The economic environment at the start of the project was not encouraging to the restructuring
process on KR. This, however, changed in the latter half of the Project. There was significant
resistance to change within KR in the early years of the Project, but there has been a noticeable
change in the outlook, and a more commercial orientation has emerged, especially in the non-
technical departments. During the project, KR should have made a better use of the Technical
Assistance inputs. There was reluctance to replace or terminate ineffective TA. Inter-departmental
coordination was not effective, and this affected implementation of the Project, particularly in
locomotive maintenance. There was little enthusiasm, particularly in the Mechanical Department, to
re-vitalize essential maintenance management systems, which had atrophied by long years of neglect.



- 10-
The last two years of the Project was marked by delays in processing Payment Applications through
MOTC, MOF and CBK, adversely affecting receipts of supplies.
G.  ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOME
43.   In view of the deterioration in the operational performance and the consequent lack of
economic return on investment, the Project outcome is rated as "unsatisfactory".
H.  FUTURE OPERATION OF PROJECT
44.    The objective of future operations are: (i) consolidation of and building upon the gains of the
concluded project; and (ii) remedying of weaknesses observed during project implementation. The
actions needed are generally in line with KR's commitments under the Parastatal Reform and
Privatization Project (PRPP: Cr. 2440-KE). The first objective of consolidation and building on gains
is to be addressed by: (i) the financial restructuring of KR; (ii) a Performance Contract to be agreed
upon by KR with GOK; (iii) separation of passenger services with a distinct managerial and financial
unit therefore, with losses underwritten by GOK; (iv) continued implementation of the staff
retrenchment program; and (v) introduction of staff productivity incentive schemes. The second
objective of remedying weaknesses is to be addressed by: (i) contracting out locomotive overhauls
and maintenance; (ii) contracting with Magadi Soda for leasing out locomotive and wagons to allow
the latter to run their trains on KR lines; (iii) implementation of the recommendations of the Supplies
Management Study; and (iv) private sector (customer) participation in wagon repairs and repowering
of shunting locomotives with contracted freight movements for these customers. Further monitoring
and follow-up by the Bank could be done through the implementation/supervision phase of the PRPP.
A chart showing KR's plan of action is at Appendix C.
1.   KEY LESSONS LEARNED
45.    Structural Changes: (i) The Borrower's commitment to major structural changes needs to
be positively demonstrated before commencing project implementation; in this case the MOU
remained only a statement of good intentions till the mid-part of the implementation phase, when the
informal suspension of new commitments triggered a response from GOK (ii) Chronic institutional
problems (like, in this case, the locomotive maintenance delivery system) need to be addressed with
fundamental reform, which could include private sector involvement.
46.    Technical Assistance: (i) Borrower and implementing agency ownership of T.A. must be
ensured before commencing on any large scale T.A. inputs; (ii) T. A. design should provide for
periodical evaluation of performance of consultants and counterparts; and (iii) T.A. inputs need to be
properly phased, and be flexible to match absorption capacity of the clients and availability of
supporting inputs like spares (lessons drawn from results of TA inputs)
47.    Procurement of spares and equipment: (i) Ordering of equipment spares should be done
in suitable tranches to provide for flexibility and updating of requirements; (ii) capability for spares
supplies management must be demonstrated by the managers nominated to manage the spares
procurement; otherwise, it would be better to employ a capable specialized procurement agency; (iii)
specification of equipment and machinery should ensure that only equipment with a proven record of
performance in a similar environment is considered, to avoid supply of unsuitable equipment; and (iv)
critical spares should be procured only from the Original Equipment Manufacturer, or other proven
suppliers (lessons drawn from spares procurement experience under the project).

Explanatory Notes for Table 6
1.      Revenue
There was a steady percentage increase in revenue until the end of FY1991, resulting from a corresponding
increase in ton-kilometers and tariff increases. This was then followed by a steady decline in ton-kilometers over the
rest of the credit period which was however offset by increases in tariffs. In FY1994 there was a disproportionate
percentage increase in revenue of 53% which corresponds to KRC charging for some key commodities in dollars e.g.
transit goods, containers, soda ash and fluorspar. During this period the Kenyan shilling depreciated dramatically
against all the major hard currencies. The provisional revenue for FY1995 shows a decline in revenue of 12% over
FY1994 which has been influenced by decreases in ton-kilometers, appreciation of the Kenyan shilling against the
major world currencies and discounts and rebates given on selected commodities in an attempt to attract freight traffic.
2.       Working Expenses
Percentage changes year to year are not consistent. In some years expenditure increases have been below
6% (FY1989, 1991, 1993) while in others increases were just over 20% (FY1990, 1992) and exceeded percentage
revenue increases. FY1995 projections show that expenditure increases by nearly 12% resulting in an increased
working ratio. The fluctuations in working expenditure percentage increases reflect ad hoc application of tighter
controls on expenditure following years in which expenditure increases were considered high.

3.      Depreciation and Amortization
Annual depreciation rose dramatically in FY1990 following an asset revaluation. These charges were fairly
constant thereafter.
4.      Interest on Capitl
These charges doubled between FY 1993 and FY1994 because of penalties on overdue debt, depreciation of
the Kenyan shilling and the fact that KRC started accruing correctly for interest on capital. KRC did not accrue for
interest on loans from FY 1992 (and earlier financial years) except for actual payments e.g. unpaid interest for CR.
1820-KE had not been previously accrued for in KRC's accounts. Had the Corporation accounted for interest on
capital correctly in the earlier years of the credit period the financial losses in those years would have been higher.
5.      Net Income
KRC registered losses in every financial year during the credit period except FY 1993. These losses would
have been far higher if foreign exchange losses had been charged to the profit and loss account as required by Kenyan
Accounting Standard Number 9 (e.g. exchange losses in FY1993 were K Sh. 785.9m which wipes out the purported
profit of K Sh. 97m). If in addition unpaid interest on capital was accrued for and provision for bad and doubtful debts
were higher, the financial results would have been much worse. Adjustments for these items which were not included
in financial years prior to FY 1994 have been passed in the final accounts for FY 1994.
6.      Cuffent Ratio
The current ratio met the targets in the project agreement in every financial year until FY1992. Thereafter
the ratio fell below 1.5:1 which was far less than the targeted 2.5:1. This coincided with KR accounting correctly for
the short term portion of long term debt, and including this portion in current liabilities. Had this been done in earlier
years the current ratio would have been lower.
7.      Debt to Equity Ratio
The target debt to equity ratio of 1.22:1 was met in every year except for FY1989. This was mainly because
of the asset revaluation in FY 1990 and inclusion of land in fixed assets for the efforts time in FY 1992.
8.      Working Ratio
KRC has failed to meet the working ratio targets in the project agreement in every year except FY1994. The
working ratio is projected to rise to 84% in FY1995 showing that the organization's expenditures are still not tightly

9.      Debtors and Creditors
Debtor days increased from 83 days to 101 from 1992 to 1994 because the Corporation's parastatal and
government ministry customers were finding it hard to service their accounts. There is also a material amount in
dispute between KRC and the major oil marketing companies.

The "without" and "with" project estimates of traffic assumed for the economic analysis in the SAR
were the following:
Year       Traffic in billion net Tkm
Without project    With Project    Actual
1988        1.896           1.896           1.700

1990        1.997           2.011          2.000
1991        1.929           2.092           1.920

1995         n.a.           2.306           1.370
As the traffic level has fallen much below even the "without project" level, there is no positive Economic Rate of
Return from the Project.

APPENDIX A
KENYA
SECOND RAILWAYS PROJECT: (Cr. 1820-KE)
IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION MISSION - July 1995
Aide Memoire
A World Bank Implementation Completion Mission consisting of Messrs. Sujeer
Nayak (Senior Railway Engineer) and Simon Thomas (Senior Transport Economist)
visited Kenya from July 3 to 13, 1995. They were joined by Mr. Sasia Josephat of the
Bank's Resident Mission in Nairobi. The British Overseas Development Administration
(ODA), co-financier for the Project, was represented by Mr. John Craik, Africa Railways
Field Manager, who participated in all the activities of the Mission. The Mission had
extensive discussions with the Executive Chairman and management of Kenya Railways,
and the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Transport & Communication (MOTC), and
officers of the Ministry of Finance (MOF) - (DGIPE and Budget). The Mission also held
a meeting with the beneficiaries of the Project - viz., the important railway customers in
order to elict their response to the Project results. The MOTC and MOF deputed Messrs.
Vincent Omukoko and Laban Mbaabu respectively to participate in the Mission. The
Mission wishes to express its thanks to the Ministries and the management of Kenya
Railways for the unstinting cooperation and assistance provided. This Aide Memoire
summarizes the findings and agreements of the Mission, which are subject to confirmation
by the Bank's malnagement.
2.    The objective of the Mission was primarily to undertake an assessment in the field
of (a) the degree of achievement of project objectives; (b) prospects for the project's
sustainability; (c) Bank and borrower performance; (d) project outcome; and (e) the plan
for future operations of KR in order to maximnise the project benefits. The findings of the
Mission will form the basis for the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the
Project and the following paragraphs generally follow the framework for the ICR.
Objectives of the Project:
3.    The objectives of the Project as laid out in the Development Credit Agreement
(DCA) were twofold: (i) achieving needed organizational restructuring and more
commercially oriented managerial skills on KR and (ii) revitalizing KR's operational
performance. Attainment of these objectives would enable KR to better filfihl its role in
Kenya's economy. While the objectives were clear, they also left sufficient room for
flexibility in project implementation. A major change in the organizational culture and
orientation from the traditional state-owned, state-controlUed entity to a commercially
oriented autonomous parastatal was envisaged. This change demanded a lot from the
borrower and the implementing agency in the early stages of project implementation,
taking into account the then prevailing economic environment. KR's operatng results had
been adversely affected by poor locomotive performance and inadequate operational



2
planning, and the second project objective was directed towards eliminating these
constraints.
Achievement of Project Objectives:
4.    Significant success has been achieved in the first objective of institutional and
organizational development especially during the last two to three years of the Project,
when major strides were made by KR towards restructuring and commercialization.
Notable successes were
* Establishment of the Business & Operations Division
* Preparation of KR's Corporate Plan and its periodic updating
*  Freight tariff autonomy for KR
*  Introduction of Traffic Costing Systems and cost-related tariffs
*  Substantial use of contracted freight services
* Closing of stations with little commercial significance to conmmercial operations
* Focus on block train operations
* Improvements in the Budgeting System
* First steps towards separation of passenger services from freight services
* Commencement of a major staff rationalization exercise
* Introduction of private sector (customer) participation in wagon repairs
* Hiring of locomotives from South Africa, including their maintenance services
* Steps towards private sector operation of trains on KR lines (Magadi Soda)
5.    In respect of operational performance, however, the Project failed to attain its
objectives; freight traffic fell substantially in the latter half of the Project owing, primarily,
to poor locomotive availability and reliability. Towards the end of the Project, the wagon
availability also became a constraining factor, even with the depressed traffic levels.
Unfortunately, business initiatives could not be sustained owing to severely constrained
system capacities.
Implementation Record:
Part A of the Project: Restructuring and Institutional Development:
6.    The thrust towards restructuring of KR - GOK relations was based on the
Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), signed in April 1989 and valid for five years
thereafter. It provided for (i) KR's tariff autonomy; (ii) compensation payments to KR for
GOK- mandated non-commercial services and costs of excess staff resulting from policy
constraints; (iii) timely provision of foreign exchange for KR's needs; (iv) GOK facilitation
of payment of debts by other parastatal entities to KR; and (v) KR's undertaking to
achieve specified performance targets.



3
7.    Initially, KR still had to obtain GOK approval for tariff increases and there were
serious delays in approval of KR's tariff revision proposals. For example, tariff revision
proposals made by KR in November 1987 were approved in May 1989. When it became
clear that tariff autonomy had not been achieved, the Bank had to intervene by the
informal suspension of approval of new commitments under the Credit, which lasted for
nine months. Ultimately, in 1991, KR was given the freedom to set its tariffs without prior
GOK approval. KR lodged its first compensation claim in April 1991 to cover the
shortfall in revenue occasioned by delays in approval of tariff revision proposals and losses
in the operation of the Nairobi commuter services. After offsetting an interim payment of
K. Shs. 100 million made by GOK in January 1989, GOK adjusted the balance of K. Shs
291.25 million of the claim towards KR's debt servicing obligations to GOK. The second
claim was made by KR for losses sustained in the operation of the Nairobi commuter
services in September 1992 for K. Shs. 71.09 million. This was settled by GOK, partly by
payment and partly by offsetting it against KR's indebtedness to GOK. KR also briefly
suspended the commuter services but had to resume them on a directive from GOK.. The
third claim for K. Shs. 265 miUion for losses on.passenger services lodged in 1993 was not
paid by GOK. Throughout the life of the MOU, KR did not lodge any claims for non-
remunerative branch line operation, or for the lake marine services, even though these
were patently justified.
8.    After a period of slow attrition of staff through natural wastage, the pace of staff
rationalization accelerated towards the end of the project with a voluntary retirement
scheme, as well as a retrenchment scheme, which is being financed from the sale of surplus
railway land. KR's staffing level declined as follows:
Year-->      88    89    90    91    92    93    94    95    (12/96)*
Number(000) 22.05 21.65 21.13 20.62 20.91 19.66 18.96 17.30 (14.50)
* Planned.
9.    In the last year of the Project, KR started the exercise of separation of passenger
services from freight services with a study financed by the Swedish Trust Fund, and
Technical Assistance financed from the Credit. The accounts had been separated by June
1995, and the setting up of the Passenger Services Division is to follow.
10. The Training component of the Project had to be abandoned and the funds transferred
to locomotive spares, which had priority as a matter of survival. Proposals for twinning
arrangements with a well established railway training school overseas were progressed to
the stage of the TOR, but, with the financing of locomotive spares claiming priority, the
proposal was kept in abeyance. The Credit financed a study for preparing plans and
estimates for modernizing the Training School. This work now awaits future financing.
The traiining school, however, continued its in-house training program, with more
emphasis since 1992 on the training of managers and specialized staff for maintenance of
diesel locomotives.



4
I1.   It was during the last two years of the Project's life, that KR achieved most of the
significant restructuring actions and significant institutional advances listed above. The
reasons for this were a combination of (i) the changing economic environment in the
country which provided a more favourable environment for such actions, (ii) KR's
response to the increasing crisis in its operations, and (iii) persistent encouragement from
the financing agencies.
Part B of the Project: Motive Power:
12.   Motive Power availability, which stood at 53 percent reckoned on 219
locomotives at the beginning of the Project fell to 46% reckoned on 156 locomotives at its
close. The arrival of the 10 new locomotives just before the Project commenced served to
increase the motive power capacity in the early years of the Project, but soon the
availability of all locomotives, including the new ones, dropped with the inevitable
repercussion on traffic. The reliability levels were also unacceptably low, ranging between
6893 kms. between failures at the start of the Project, and 3323 kms. at its close.
13.   The major financial input into the Project was in terms of locomotive spares on
which US$ 22 million were provided from the IDA credit, and GBP 3.2 million for
locomotive rehabilitation from ODA financing. This very sizeable input had no
appreciable impact on the locomotive problem. The maintenance and supplies management
was unable to control and manage the situation. The underlying causes have been
determined to be:
(i) poor coordination between the Maintenance and Supplies Departments in
prioritizing and ordering of the spares;
(ii) erroneous identification of spares in the first two lots (S16.4 million)
undertaken independently by the Mechanical department; (the third and fourth lots
of spares, procured on an emergency basis in the latter half of the Project were
listed after detailed scrutiny by an inter-departmental Task Force of KR);
(iii) all the spares in the first two lots being procured under ICB, without regard to
the criticality of their application on the locomotives and the absence of inspection
at source (even though KR has this option under the contracts), leading to some
fake spares being received, which in turn, led to major equipment failures with
heavy consequential damage and the setting aside of such stocks of spares: the
provision in the Credit Agreement for proprietary spares to be procured directly
froethe original manufacturers was not used;
(iv) the very large (S 12.3 million) first order for spares; a judiciously tranched
procurement could have led to better prioritization;



5
(v) the expectation when preparing the spares lists, that consumable spares would
be procured with KR's own funds which, in the event, were insufficient for the
purpose;
(vi) the large number of locomotives damaged in accidents; the current backlog on
KR is as many as 20 locomotives awaiting accident repairs; KR set up an effective
Accident Investigation Unit with T.A. under the Project which resulted in a
significant reduction in the incidence of derailments till 1993, but with an
increasing trend thereafter. Accidents due to human operational errors have
continued to take a heavy toll of locomotives;
(vii) in the last year of the project, the delays experienced in passing payment
applications through MOTC, MOF and CBK affecting the timely procurement of
spares and equipment;
(viii) the atrophy of essential systems of maintenance management, monitoring and
failure analysis, which was pointed out in Supervision Missions, and which KR has
tried to rectify in the concluding years of the Project, and
(ix) some erroneous technical decisions, like the use of fuel filters in place of lube
oil filters, leading to large scale damage to engine assemblies.
14.   The result of the above has resulted in a situation at the end of the Project when
only 38 % of the spares procured have been used, with the remaining 62 % still in the
Stores, in the face of a continuing acute scarcity of essential spares for locomotive
maintenance.
15.   In the last year of the Project, KR resorted to hiring 10 locomotives from Spoornet
(South Africa) to augment the motive power capacity. This, however, has not produced an
increase in traffic, because of: (i) wagon capacity having become a major constraint with
availability levels falling below 50 %; and (ii) the loss of some customers who were
neglected in favour of the emergency food movements in 1994. It has, however, opened
the eyes of KR's management to the advantages of private sector participation in
locomotive maintenance.
16.   Five 87 class locomotives were rehabilitated and six 71/72 class locomotives were
overhauled under the ODA-financed component of the Project. The performance of these
locomotives could not, however, be sustained because of the interchange of sub-
assemblies between the rehabilitated / overhauled locomotives and the remainder of the
fleet. KR als6 had problems in obtaining the required spares for rehabilitated locomotives
owing to the problems referred to in paragraph 13 above.
17.   Wagon maintenance and capacity were not considered to be significant problems
during formulation of the Project, but the continued scarcity of finance for essential spares
and dwindling workshop out-turn of wagons after repairs have led to a crisis. The matter



6
was highlighted during a Supervision Mission in early 1994, and since then: KR has
instituted an incentive system in workshops, which has led to a significant increase in the
output from the workshops Unfortunately, this has not been reflected in improvement in
overall availability levels. KR has undertaken a physical census of wagons in May 1995
and is reconciling the data, in order to take correct stock of the situation.
Part C of the Project Operational Improvements:
18    The most significant aspect of improvements in train planning and operations has
been the increase in the number of point-to-point block trains and the elirnination of
commercial freight operations at all stations except 23 commercially significant stations.
This has led to improvements in transit times. Wagon turnround has shown improvement,
but not to the levels anticipated during formulation of the Project.
19,   Crew productivity has improved with the comnissioning of the Running Room at
Mtito-Andei under the Project: Nairobi-Mombasa trains no longer run with a caboose to
carry a duplicate set of crew, thus increasing the effective train capacity, and the incidence
of stabling of trains en route on account of excessive crew hours has also been reduced
substantially.
20.   Locomotive fuelling facilities were constructed at Nakuru, Voi, Eldoret and
Mombasa under the Project, increasing flexibility in rnotive power planning and
operations. The fuelling facility at Kisumu was, however, abandoned at the foundation
stage, when the contractor failed to deliver.
21.   There were seven sand drying facilities planned under the Project at Mombasa,
Kajiado, Kisumu, Sagana, Eldoret, Nairobi and Nakuru. Of these, the plans for Mombasa,
Kajiado and Eldoret were dropped after a review of the locomotive operating and
maintenance strategies. Buildings to house the facilities were constructed at Voi, Nairobi,
Sagana and Nakuru, but the elaborate equipment planned by KR was not installed, and
sand is being dried naturally at these sites. The facilities planned were overly elaborate and
not justified; a simpler system would have been more economical and would have
functioned as effectively.
22.   The planned provision of new air compressors for testing of air brakes on
locomotives and wagons was substituted by the provision of compressors released from
92 class locomotives consequent to modifications on the locomotives.
23.   23 ballast hopper wagons and three front end ballast loaders were acquired by KR
under financing from ODA, these have served KR well in carrying out track ballasting
operations. The 20 tallow wagons, also procured with ODA financing are in service.
24.   KR acquired a mobile on-track flash butt welder with financing from the Credit.
This machine has not functioned effectively, and KR has had innumerable problems with it
right from its arrival. During nearly five years, only 50 km of KR's track has been welded



7
with the machine. KR understands that this machine was a prototype for a metre gauge
system.
25.   VHF radio sets in the Nairobi and Mombasa railway complexes and five telephone
exchanges were acquired by KR with ODA financing. These are in effective use, except
for problems with the VHF sets on shunting locomotives owing to frequent interchanges
between locomotives when the latter were changed for reasons of unreliability in
mechanical performance. For telecommunications West of Nairobi, a study proposed an
ambitious and capital-intensive system for which there was no financing available. In the
final stages of the Project, the situation became critical and an Emergency
Telecommunications project was started, with financing from the Credit. The actual
financing of this component from the Credit is, however, in jeopardy owing to delays in
passing the Payment Applications through MOTC, MOF and CBK beyond the closing
date.
26.   Operational efficiency could not be very. significantly improved during the project,
principally due to the poor reliability aid availability of locomotives, which made traffic
operational planning very difficult. Physical transport capacity was severely constrained,
primarily by poor motive power perf4rmance. Passenger services had to be drastically
curtailed during the Project owing to scarcity of motive power. The trend of traffic
through put during the Project was as follows:

Financial Performance:
Overall Financial Position:
27.   The financial position of KR at the end of the project could be described as
technically insolvent with its short term liabilities greatly exceeding its available assets.
Accumulated arrears of interest and principal repayments have reached almost Ksh 7
billion and a major financial restructuring is required if KR's financial position is to be re-
established. The rapid depreciation of the Ksh has played a substantial role in the
deteriorating financial position of KR which bears the foreign exchange risk for most of its
loans. The impact of the depreciating Ksh has, however, been compounded by the poor
operating performance of KR which has constrained revenues and thus KR's ability to
service its debts.



8
Revenues:
28.   KR is basically a freight railway (freight revenue has risen from about 81% of total
revenue in FY88 to 89% in FY95) and its overall revenue position is dependent upon both
its freight traffic and tariffs. Freight tariffs, during the project period, essentially kept pace
with the rate of general inflation in the economy except in FY94 when the Ksh value of
US$ denominated freight rates increased substantially with the depreciation of the Ksh and
average revenue per ton-km increased by 58% compared an inflation rate of 29%. KR has
been able to utilize fully its tariff autonomy and is now only constrained by market
conditions, as illustrated by the tariff reductions necessary in FY95.
29.   KR's major revenue problem has been its inability to maintain its freight capacity
since FY90; by FY94, freight traffic had declined by over 35%, from almost 2 billion ton-
kms to 1.28 billion ton-kms. 'KR is now carrying only about 50% of the freight traffic
forecast when the project was developed. It is very difficult to envisage a long term
commercial future for KR unless freight traffic can be substantially increased above its
present levels; even with freight traffic growing to almost 4 million tonnes, financial
restructuring is necessary.
30.   Passenger tariffs also rose, on average, to reflect inflation but the tariff adjustments
have been more erratic. Passenger traffic has, however, halved over the project period.
Expenditures:
31.   Increases in working expenses, on average, have been held well below the rate of
inflation although there has been a pattern of strict control of expenditure in some periods
followed by significant increases in subsequent years. The only exception to slow
expenditure growth has been traffic expenses which have increased very substantially since
FY90, reflecting the increasing cost of diesel and the imposition of ful taxation. Traffic
expenses over the period have increased from less than 20% of working expenses to
almost 35%.
32.   Strict expenditure control is always essential but there are limits to the level of cost
savings that can be achieved by increased efficiency without major shifts in operating
practices and service provision. Some of the expenditure control may have been achieved
by disinvestment in the essential assets of KR through inadequate maintenance of track,
motive power and rolling stock. If FY87 expenditure levels reflected adequate
maintenance of these assets, there has been a shortfall of expenditure, over the project
period, of over Ksh 2 billion (FY94 price levels) for track maintenance and about Ksh 850
million for motive power and rolling stock maintenance. The deterioration in track
conditions and the low levels of availability reflect the inadequate maintenance.
33.   Staff costs have been reduced from over 50% of working expenses to about 34%.
There was a steady attrition in staff numbers over the project period, down from over
22,000 at the end of FY88 to 17,300 at the end of FY95. The major contribution to the



9
containment of staff costs has been, however, the limitations on wage and salary levels;
real wage/salary costs have halved over the project period. While expedient in the short
term, this fall in real income levels could result in inadequate motivation and an inability to
recruit and retain staff of the quality required to operate a commercially successful
enterprise.
Financial Outlook:
34.   The present financial situation of KR is bleak. If freight traffic is to be increased
on a sustainable basis, the only long term commercial future for KR, increased expenditure
will be required for the maintenance of KR's essential assets. Such increased expenditure
will only be possible through financial restructuring, substantial staff retrenchment, and
either the elimination of KR's non-commercial activities or adequate compensation for
their continuation.
Technical Assistance in the Proiect:
35.   The project contained a very substantial component of Technical Assistance in the
form of Advisers to almost all departments of KR. The benefits flowing from this
component have been far from impressive, with a few exceptions. The Mission had
extensive discussions with KR managers on this subject. While, in general, they were of
the opinion that the Technical Advisers did a good job, the Mission could sense an
undercurrent of dissatisfaction with the performance of some of the Technical Advisers.
The design and operation of the T.A. component were deficient in the following aspects:
- the volume of T.A. was large and concentrated within a short period. This magnitude
could not be absorbed by KR officers;
?  commencement of work simultaneously by almost all the TA. personnel with little
prior preparation by KR,
* lack of strong positive ownership of the component on the part of KR managers - as a
result, the follow-up of recommendations made by the Advisers was slow and half-
hearted; the T.A. modules were based on initial studies, which were reviewed by the
Board of Directors and agreed upon with the financing agencies, without much
involvement and input from the lower levels of management;
* the reported lack of field orientation of some of the T. A. personnel, which was also a
weakness with many KR managerial units - this compounded the problem;
* lack of a formal system of periodical evaluation of Technical Advisers and
counterparts during the functioning of the T.A.; this could have assisted in timely
sensing of the problems and the undertaking of appropriate measures;
* the hiatus in the management processes and the uncertainty on KR during the
Presidential Inquiry in 1989 and the immediate aftermath thereof, causing loss of
effective time of the Advisers; and
e reluctance of both KR and the financing agencies to replace ineffective T. A.



10
36.   Successes of T.A. were recorded in (i) setting up of the Accident Investigation
Unit; (ii) workshop training; (iii) maintenance of 93 class locomotives; and (iv) traffic
operations' planning. The areas where failure was most evident were (i) locomotive
maintenance and (ii) supplies management. A short Emergency Supplies Management
Consultancy was organized with financing from the Credit towards the end of the Project
in order to retrieve some lost ground; the recommendations were under implementation at
the end of the Project.

Factors influencing the Implementation Record:
38.   External factors affecting KR's performance during the Project were
(i)   the exchange rate which changed from 16.5 K. Shs / US$ at the start of the
Project to 80 K. Shs.JUS$ in 1993, and down to 50 K.Shs.JUS$ at the end of the
Project. The inflation rates were also much higher than forecast. The abnormally
high interest rates on overdrafts in 1993 also affected KR, whose cash flow needed
overdrafts, adversely affected the financial situation;
(ii)  the delay and unsatisfactory implementation of the MOU.
(iii) delays in passing of Payment Applications through MOTC, MOF and CBK
towards the close ofthe Project;
(iv)  the imposition of VAT, Customs Duty on imports and the Road
Maintenance Levy on diesel fuel costs - these were not anticipated in the forecasts;
the fuel bill alone almost tripled; KR's competitiveness with road truckers was
affected, as reportedly, as the VAT on freight was not strictly enforceable on the
latter;
(v)   liberalization of transport in Kenya: this adversely affected KR's haulage of
domestic foodgrains and sugar, but KR has managed to gain some petroleum
traffic from the Pipeline Company.
39.   The internal factors within KR which affected project implementation have been
dealt with in the preceding paragraphs covering the Implementation Record.
Sustainability of the Project:
40.   As explained in the previous paragraphs, the successes have been mainly in the
institutional and organizational development fields. These have a high probability of being
sustained in the prevailing liberalized economic environment in Kenya. In this, KR will be
aided by inputs from the Parastatal Reform and Privatization Project (Cr.2440 - KE). KR
has embarked on the following important measures:
* A financial restructuring proposal to be finalized with GOK. This needs to be
critically reviewed by both parties and finalized.
* A draft performance Contract to be discussed and agreed with GOK.
* Program to separate passenger services to make its financial status fully
transparent, and to avoid cross subsidization from freight revenues.
*  Continued implementation of the Staff Retrenchment Program with a target of
14,500 staff by 1996.
* Contract with Magadi Soda for leasing out locomotives and wagons to allow
Magadi Soda run their trains on KR lines.



12
* Private sector (customer) participation in wagon repairs and repowering of
shunting locomotives with contracted freight movements for these customers.
* Incentive Schemes for staff.
* Follow-up on the recommendations of the recent Emergency Supplies
Management Study
* KR top management has, in principle, decided to involve the private sector, in
stages, in the major overhauls and maintenance of locomotives- the detailed
modalities are yet to be reviewed and evaluated.
41.   The threats to sustainability are:
* the continued application of the State Corporations Act (1986), which, inter
alia, regulates stAff salaries on KR. KR's staff salaries nave not kept pace with
inflation, and the salaries of the higher echelons in management have fared
even worse that the other staff. Skills are draining away from KR, and with no
prospect of improvement in remuneration, it will become worse.
* any let up in the initiatives referred to in paragraph 40 above.
* inadequate attention to operational infornation systems, which can affect pro-
active responses to situations.
* inadequate attention to developing a culture of accountability at all levels.
Bank Performance:
42.   Identification and preparation of the Project were undertaken by the Bank and
ODA jointly with KR  The Project was a sequel to the First Railway project and
addressed weaknesses in the institution, structure and organization of KR, in its
relationship with GOK, and in the equipment maintenance function. Supervision Missions
were timely and frequent. The earlier supervision style of holding joint meetings with all
members of KR top management was subsequently changed to meetings and discussions
with individual departmental heads and field visits in addition to general meetings. This
was found to be more effective in identifying and addressing issues. The needed flexibility
within the Project scope was exercised in response to the changing needs of KR,
particularly in the latter half of the Project. Advice tendered during Supervision Missions
helped KR and GOK to decide eventually on the changes needed in the restructuring
process, and in identifying weaknesses and addressing them. However,the Bank could
have taken a more active stand when it was clear that T. A. was ineffective. The Bank's
action in the informal suspension in approving new commitments under the Project
accelerated the granting of tariff autonomy to KR..
Borrower Performance:
43.   The economic environment at the start of the project was not encouraging to the
restructuring process on KR. This, however, changed in the latter half of the Project.
There was significant resistance to change within KR in the early years of the Project, but
there has been a noticeable change in the outlook, and a more commercial orientation has



13
emerged especially in the non-technical departments. During the Project, KR might have
made a better use of the Technical Assistance inputs. Inter-departmental coordination was
not effective, and this affected implementation of the Project, particularly in locomotive
maintenance The last two years of the Project was marked by delays in processing
Payment Applications through MOTC, MOF and CBK, adversely affecting receipts of
supplies.
Assessment of Outcome:
44.   In view of the shortfall in the operational performance and the consequent poor
economic return on investment, the Project will be rated as "unsatisfactory".
Future Operations:
45.   KR's framework for their future plan is still under preparation, and KR agreed to
send it to the Bank by July 31, 1995.
Lessons Learnt from implementation:
46.   Where important structural changes are anticipated under a Project, large scale
investments should, as far as possible, follow, and not precede, actual implementation of
basic criteria needed for the change and demonstration of commitment to change. (lesson
drawn from delays in and poor implementation of the MOU)
47.   Technical Assistance: (i) Borrower and implementing agency ownership of T.A.
must be ensured before commencing on any large scale T.A. inputs; (ii) T. A. design
should provide for periodical evaluation of performance of consultants and counterparts;
and (iii) T.A. inputs need to be properly phased to match absorption capacity of the
clients (lessons drawn from results of T.A. inputs)
48.   Procurement of spares and equipment: (i) Ordering of equipment spares should
be done in suitable tranches to provide for flexibility and updating of requirements; (ii)
capability for spares supplies management must be demonstrated by the managers
nominated to manage the spares procurement; otherwise, it would be better to employ a
capable specialized procurement agency; (iii) specification of equipment and machinery
should ensure that only equipment with a proven record of performance in a similar
environment is considered, to avoid supply of unsuitable equipment; and (iv) critical spares
should be procured only from the Original Equipment Manufacturer, or other proven
suppliers (lessons drawn from spares procurement experience under the project)
Customer Response:
49. The Mission held a meeting with important customers of KR in order to elicit their
response to the Project results. (A separate meeting was held with Magadi Soda Ltd., as



14
they were not able to attend the meeting).The following firrms were represented at the
meeting, which was chaired by the Divisional Manager (Business & Operations) of KR:
Barnburi Cements
Transarni
Fluorspar Co.
Del Monte
Freight Forwarders Ltd.,
Shell Oil Co.
50.  The customers were unanimous in their strong appreciation of the recent changes in
KR in its attitude to customers and in its commercial orientation. They stated that KR was
their preferred mode of transport, but the lack of capacity and the unreliability of KR's
operations had forced them to shift to road transport. Some customers were willing to
invest in railway equipment, including repair and rehabilitation of equipment, in return for
dedicated services and negotiated tariff rebates. Messrs. Freight Forwarders had already
started with 150 dedicated wagons. They were financing the rehabilitation of two shunting
locomotives and the conversion of 100 wagons to flat trucks for container service. They
intended to take over the maintenance of their dedicated fleet of wagons. In conjunction
with KR and URC, they had been able to increase the Ugandan transit traffic carried by
them from 56,000 T in 1993 to 256,300 T in the first 11 months of 1994-95. Transamni,
Delmonte and Acme (Uganda) were also poised for a similar exercise, with 30, 50 and 60
wagons respectively. Magadi Soda hoped to finalize a contract with KR by July 15, 1995
for taking over of the Konza - Magadi branch line, lease of five main line locomotives
which would be rehabilitated by them, and the hopper wagon fleet. Magadi Soda will be
setting up a #ubsidiary (Magadi Railway) to operate this contract, which will include train
operations on KR lines upto Mombasa on a trackage rights basis. Shell Oil was providing
LPG tanks and was also sending substantial amounts of oils from Mombasa to Uganda by
rail after the monopoly of the pipeline was eliminated with the petroleum sector
liberaiization policy of GOK.
5 1. The customers were, however, highly critical of the reliability and efficiency of KR's
operations, arising from the motive power and wagon situation. They were also very
unhappy with the operations of KPA, which, they felt, would be a serious bottleneck, even
if KR's operations improved. Container handling delays in KPA camne in for the severest
criticism. .
Project Statistics and Performance Data:
52. KR has provided the Mission with a substantial part of the information needed for
the ICR. KR agreed to send the remaining information listed below to Washington by the
end of July 1995:



15
* KR's Project expenditure on inland transport of spares and equipment
* Updated Project Account Statement
* Yearly expenditure on locomotive spares from KR finances
* Proportion of unused spares from Lots I and II
* Operating Plan
* Value of fake spares received, and cost of consequential damage
*  Effect of VAT, RML and Duty, in terms of KR's annual revenues
* Transit traffic on a yearly basis during the Project period
* Provisional operating and financial statistics for FY 95
* Foreign Exchange requested, and actually made available by GOK
* Details of staff training external to KR
* No. of locomotives damaged in accidents, on a yearly basis
* List of all Technical Assistants, with designations, durations and financing sources
Time Table for ICR:
53. The following Time Table was agreed upon for the preparation of the ICR:
Draft ICR to be sent by IDA to KR and GOK:             September 30, 1995
Comments on draft ICR and KR/GOK contribution
(Appendix) to be sent to IDA:                          October 31, 1995.
54. KR has been provided with copies of relevant Bank Procedures and Good Practices
during the December 1994 Supervision Mission, and the procedures have been discussed
by the Mission with Mr. Murage, who is KR's nominated liaison officer for the purpose.

APPENDIX B
BORROWER'S CONTRIBUTION TO THE ICR
KENYA RAILWAYS PROJECT
(CR. 1820-KE)
IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
Statement of original objectives
1.    The objectives of the project were two, namely:
a.    to achieve needed organizational restructuring and more commercially oriented
managerial skills in the KR; and
b.    to revitalize KR's operating performance.
2.    The first objective called for the introduction of missing functions, strengthening weak
functions, regrouping existing and new functions into a divisionalized organization with a view
to changing the corporation from a traditional railways operation to a commercial one.
3.    The second objective, on performance was aimed at turning the efficiency of the
corporation around from a loss-making organization to a profitable entity. These objectives were
based on the findings of five studies undertaken under the First Railways Project. They were
appropriate, clear and unanimous and remained as originally defined in the Staff Appraisal
Report but were demanding on both the borrower (GOK) and the implementing agency (the KR).
Achievement of objectives
4.    In respect of the first objective, significant progress was achieved, as detailed below:
(i)    A new department for business development and an accident investigation unit
were established; a Central Workshops and the Electrical and Communications
departments were also created. Internal Audit and Data Processing sections
were elevated to full departments. A Divisionalized organization came into
being:
(ii)   A corporate planning process was established;
(iii)   Freight tariff autonomy was introduced;
(iv)   Cost-based tariffs were introduced;
(v)    Prioritization of traffic and customer-based contracts came into being;
(vi)   Non-commercial stations were closed leaving only 23 commercial stations;
(vii)  Block train operations were introduced;



- 2 -
(viii)  Budgeting systems were improved;
(ix)   First steps towards separating the passenger business from freight were taken,
starting with the introduction of separate accounts for the passenger business;
(x)    Staff rationalization commenced;
(xi)   Customer support in the conversion of wagons started;
(xii)   Ten main line locomotives were hired from South African;
(xiii)  Steps towards establishing private train operations by the Magadi Soda
Company were taken;
(xiv)  Parts of catering services were contracted out;
(xv)   Underutilized go-downs were leased-out;
(xvi)  District management was introduced;
(xvii)  A railway core commercial scenario was identified;
(xviii) Traffic costing for the computation of compensation was established.
(xix)  Railway Monitoring Group was established in the early part of the project but
ceased meeting several years later.
5.     Progress in the foregoing restructuring was rather slow at the start of the project but
picked-up speed in the later years due to a changed economic environment in favor of economic
and parastatal reforms.
6.     The second objective, on operating and financial performance was not achieved. Freight
and passenger traffic substantially fell over the period 1988 to 1994, mainly because of poor
locomotive and reliability. Wagon availability also became a constraint towards the end of the
project.
Design
7.     The need for the project was identified during the first project when funds for
undertaking studies to establish what actions were necessary for improving the financial
performance of the corporation were allocated. The studies were undertaken between 1985 and
1986 (except the Supplies Consultancy which took longer) and they covered the following five
areas:
*   Headquarters organization
*   Motive power;
*   Central workshops;
*   Training requirements;
*   Supplies.



- 3 -
8.    The findings of the studies were put together to forn a package called Short Term
Action programme (STAP). The STAP was presented to the IDA/ODA who in the course of
detailed discussions agreed to fund most of the projects therein. In the course of
implementation, increased costs and changed priorities resulted in minor modifications in the
project, which were agreed upon by the borrower/implementing agent and the financiers.
9.    The project comprised the following three parts:
Part A: Restructuring and institutional development;
Part B: Motive power;
Part C: Operational improvements.
10.   The project was estimated to cost US$45.5 million but actual cost turned out to be lower,
at US$42.12 million. It was financed jointly by the IDA, ODA, Japan and the KR as per the
table below:
Estimate (US$ million)

11.   The project was approved by the World Bank on 11th June 1987 and became effective
on 19th April 1988. The Credit (Cr. 1820-KE) was closed on 30th June 1995 except for one
component, the Emergency Telecommunications Project which was extended to 31st December
1995.



-4-
Implementation
Part A: Restructuring and Organizational Development
12.   Internal restructuring of the KR went on very smoothly and a divisionalized organization
was established in the early part of the project. Also established was district management.
13.   The relationship between the KR and the GOK was to be based on the Memorandum of
Understanding (MOU) which was signed in April 1989. The MOU spelt out the obligations of
either party. The GOK was to give KRC tariff autonomy, compensation for GOK mandated non-
commercial services and excess staff, timely provision of foreign exchange needs and facilitate
payments of debts to KR by parastatals. On the other hand the KR was to achieve specified
performance targets.
14.   Due to bureaucracy and budgetary constraints, obligations by the GOK were slow in
being met. Tariff autonomy was given in 1991. On the side of compensation, no claims have
been made on non-remunerative branch lines and marine services. Claims to cover a shortfall in
revenue arising from delayed approval of a revised tariff (before the granting of tariff
autonomy), Nairobi commuter losses and passenger business losses were raised at various times
and settlement was made as follows:
Sh. mn.
(a)         Claim lodged in April 1991 for                    391.25
(b)         Claim lodged in September 1992 for                 71.09
(c)         Claim lodged in ......... 1993 for                265.00
Total claimed                              727.34
Less:
(a)         Compensation received: April 1989                 100.00
(b)         Compensation offset against loan obligations:
(i)        291.25
(ii)         71.09
Balance unsettled       265.00
15.   Between 1986 and 1994, staff rationalization was based on attrition at half the natural
wastage. During that eight year period, employment fell by 4,158 from 23,115 to 18,957. These
numbers are planned to fall to 14,500 by 31 st December 1996 under an accelerated voluntary
retirement scheme. The scheme is being financed from sales of surplus railway land.
16.   The first steps for setting-up an autonomous Passenger Business have been taken and
separate accounts for this business were put in place in June 1995. Parts of Catering Services
have been contracted out.
17.   The training component was drastically trimmed down in favor of financing locomotive
spare parts. However, a master plan for developing the Railway Training Institute (RTI) is ready
and awaits financing.



-5-
Part B: Motive Power
18.   The area of motive power enhancement covered two main projects, namely:
(i)    The provision of additional hauling capacity and
(ii)   Improvement in maintenance standards.
19.   Additional capacity was attained through the purchase of 10 class 94 locomotives, but
financing was outside the IDA/ODA financing. The locomotives were put in stream in October
1987.
20.   A second component involved the planned rehabilitation of 5 class 87 locomotives and
10 class 71/72 locomotives. However, due to a funding constraint, 5 class 87 locomotives were
rehabilitated and 6 class 71/72 were overhauled. The performance of these locomotives was not
sustained due to unavoidable inter-changes of sub-assemblies with the rest of the fleet,
occasioned by a shortage of appropriate spares.
21.   In the area of improvement in maintenance standards, the following was achieved:
*   The Restructuring of layout and workflow at the Central workshops was executed as
planned;
a   The furbishing of diesel depots at Changamwe, Nairobi and Kisumu was not
undertaken due to financial constraints within the KR.
*   Engine test stands were not procured due to the fact that they were found to be too
expensive. As an alternative, an electrical loading device which is being designed
will be implemented.
22.   A lot of donor money was spent on the procurement of locomotive spare parts (IDA - US
$ 22 million, ODA - 3.2 mn) but serious shortcomings in the process of procurement and lapses
in maintenance standards resulted in no sustained improvement in the performance of
locomotives. In fact both locomotive availability and reliability fell over the project period (July
1987 to June 1995) as is apparent in the table below:
1987/88                    1994/95
Availability %      53.9 (in 219 locos)         52.0 (on 156 locos)
Reliability (km)    8,158                       3,143
23.   During the formulation of the project wagon capacity was not a significant problem and
hence wagon maintenance was not included in the project. However, the existence of a crisis
due to a budgetary constraint in the KR was highlighted in early 1994. IN response, an
experimental incentive scheme was instituted in the Central Workshop's wagon complex in
March of that year but the resulting output has not helped to raise wagon availability.
Part C:
24.   In the field of operational improvements were a number of projects, namely, train
planning and operations, construction of running rooms, locomotive fueling facilities, sand
during facilities, provision of air compressors procurement of ballast hopper wagons and tallow



- 6 -
tank wagons, a mobile flash butt welding machine, installation of VHF radio sets and
improvement of telecommunication west of Nairobi.
25.   Train planning improved, block train working was enhanced and commercial stations
were reduced to 23. This resulted in a reduction of transit time and an improvement in the
wagon turn-round.
26.   The construction of a running room at Mtito Andei was completed in 1991 and was put
into use, thereby increasing capacity on the train.
27.   Locomotive fueling stations were completed and commissioned at Nkuru, Voi, Eldoret
and Mombasa (High Level). At Kisumu, contraction work was abandoned at the foundation
level due to the non-performance of the contractor. The four operating fuel stations have
increased operational flexibility.
28.   Out of the planned seven sand during facilities, none has been completed. The ones
planned for Mombasa, Kajiado and Eldoret were canceled while civil works at Voi, Nairobi,
Sagana and Nakuru were completed. Mechanical facilities were not installed due to lack of local
funds. Sand drying is, therefore, going on naturally. Civil works at Kisumu were abandoned at
foundation stage due to non-performance of the contractor.
29.   The planned replacement of air brake testing compressors at locomotive and CXR depots
was drooped in favor of using WABCO air compressors recovered from class 92 locomotives
which (compressors) were being replaced. The WABCO compressors have already been
provided at Nairobi, Changamwe, Nakuru and Makadara diesel depots, Mombasa CXR depot
and Central Workshops. The savings realized were transferred to locomotive spares financing.
30.   On the side of rolling stocks, the planned acquisition of 30 ballast hopper wagons and 20
tallow tanks under ODA funding was revised downwards to 23 hoppers and 20 tanks. These
were delivered by September 1990 and are operational.
31.   A prototype mobile on-track flash butt welding machine was acquired and was
commissioned in September 1990 but its performance has been extremely poor: welding 5 joints
per hour instead of the rated 15 joints. (15 joints are for depot situation, not on-track).
32.   Front-end loaders: Five were planned for but only three were bought and commissioned
in March 1990. Their utilization on ballast loading has resulted in a faster turn-round and better
utilization of engineering trains.
33.   VHF radio sets installed in Nairobi Mombasa are fully utilized except the mobiles in
shunting locomotives. Additionally, five PABXs have each been installed at Kisumu, Railway
Training Institute, Eldoret, Malaba and Voi and are operational. The VHF and PABXs were
funded by ODA while the Emergency Telecommunications Project for West of Nairobi whose
planned completion date was 31st December 1995 was financed by IDA.
Technical assistance in the project (TA)
34.   The project contained a very substantial component of technical assistance in the form of
advisors (27 in number) to almost all departments of the KR. This involved 235 man-months



-7 -
and 493 man-months financed by IDA and ODA, respectively. The TA was concentrated in the
period 1988 to 1990.
3 5.   It was expected that the TA would be effectively managed to ensure that their
counterparts acquired needed skills, a new organizational structure for KR was smoothly
effected, required capital investment programme was supported and KR staff were developed
through both directed training and development of improved training procedures and facilities.
36.   To achieve the above objectives, TA had to be recruited in teams with team-leaders
responsible for the overall management of each team. KR management was to monitor TA's
effectiveness and ensure that necessary supporting actions were taken.
37.    Work programmes for TA were agreed upon with KR Management and progress reports
were regularly written by TA. However, certain factors constrained the performance of this
very important component of the project, the main ones being:
-     Lack of ownership of TA by counterparts;
-     Lack of a formal system for periodical evaluation of TA's and counterparts
performance;
-     Reluctance of financing agencies to replace ineffective TA;
-     Required inputs mainly locomotive spares arrived after the arrival of TA;
-      Failure or half-hearted implementation of some recommendations by TA.
38.    Successes of TA were recorded in a few areas, namely:
- Setting up of the accidents Investigation unit;
- Workshop training;
- Maintenance of 93 class locomotives;
- Manpower planning;
- Rehabilitation of class 87 and overhaul of classes 71/72.
39.   Failure was most evident in locomotive maintenance and supplies management. The
latter resulted in the undesirable stocking of 32 per cent (having utilized the other 68%) of
locomotive spares purchased under the credit. To try and remedy the situation and raise the level
of supplies, management a Short Emergency Supplies Management Consultancy was appointed
in October, 1993. The recommendations of the consultancy were under implementation at the
end of the project.
40.   Under operational improvement, the following studies/consultancies were undertaken:
Financed by IDA
(a)    Review of KR Catering Services
(b)    Study of Mau Viaducts
(c)    Asset Revaluation Study
(d)   Installation of OSCAR model for traffic costing

Factors influencing the record of implementation and operational performance.
41.   External and internal factors have influenced the progress of project implementation and
operational performance. Internal factors have already been covered in the proceeding
paragraphs. They included budgetary constraints, low performance of locomotives and wagons,
failure to identify and timely procure appropriate locomotive spare parts, failure to identify fake
spares early, overdependence on competitive bidding, lapses in locomotive maintenance
standards and so on.
42.   External factors compounded the effect of negative internal factors. They included the
movement of the foreign exchange rate, rate of inflation, heavy taxation and delays in passing
payments to overseas customers through foreign exchange authorities.
43.   The Kshilling exchange rate against hard currencies steeply plummeted over the project
period. For the same reason the loan burden was multiplied. For instance, at the start of the
project, the Kshilling exchange rate to the US dollar was Sh 16.50 rising to Sh 80 in 1993 and
easing-off to Sh 50 by the end of the project. This sharply raised the cost of the project thereby
causing the trimming down of certain components of project.
44.   The rate of inflation moved like the foreign exchange rate and reached 46 per cent in
1993. The effect of this movement and the need to mop-up excess money supply in the 1993/95
period was to steeply raise interest rates on the local money market. Hence, the cost of the
overdraft and other inputs such as diesel steeply shot up.
45.   The delayed implementation of MOU and failure to fully exploit it adversely affected
performance. Delays in passing payments to overseas suppliers (since 1992) due to Government



- 9 -
budgetary ceilings also contributed to lack of performance. Taxation (imposition of VAT and
removal of exemption from the payment of customs duty on railway materials and the imposition
of the Road Maintenance levy on diesel) significantly raised the cost of diesel and other inputs.
The need to charge customers a tariff inclusive of VAT of 15% rendered the KR less competitive
against road hauliers who may easily avoid the tax. The liberalization of the industry has
fragmented the market and has resulted in increased competition.
Evaluation of the performance of the Borrower.
46.   The economic environment which prevailed at the start of the project was not conducive
to commercialization at all. This led to delayed implementation of the MOU and compensation.
The situation has since changed and bold commercially oriented actions have been taken within
KR. On the other hand, the management of supplies and in particular locomotive spares was not
efficient. Essential locomotive maintenance management systems were not revitalized early
enough. Technical Assistance was not efficiently managed while in the later years of the project
payments to overseas customers were severely delayed.
47.   The project was jointly formulated by the Bank, ODA and the KR. Supervisory missions
were regularly and were as per set programme. A precise record of each mission was discussed
with KR's management and any required actions were agreed upon, responsibility allocated and
follow-up took place. This approach assisted the KR in effecting needed changes in the project
and in operations. On the side of TA, a more decisive action should have been taken when it
was realized that some of it was not effective. Furthermore, the temporary suspension of credit
for nine months in 1990 starved the KR of needed inputs at a time when no alternative source of
finance was available. That action was detrimental to KR's operating performance.
Lessons learned
48.   Ownership. The borrower/implementing agency must fully own the project and its
components and consequently effectively manage the implementation and other phases of the
project.
49.   The design of the TA must include a mechanism for effective management including
prompt withdrawal of non-performing TA personnel. Furthermore, the deployment of TA must
be phased-out to match-up the absorption capacity of the borrower/implementing agency. In
addition to that, short term project-based TA is likely to be more effectively manageable.
Prompt remedial action is vital for success.
50.   Procurement of spares, equipment and other inputs should be effectively managed to
ensure that critical areas are identified, prioritized, quality standards applied, follow-up actions
timely taken and so on. This would ensure that the corporation gets maximum benefits from the
project. In turn, project sustainability would be facilitated.
Operating and financial performance
51.   The impact of the factors discussed in the preceding paragraphs on the level of
operations was to reduce locomotive performance and hence freight carrying capacity. At the
end of the project freight tonnes and tonne-kilometres had fallen to levels below those reached at
the start of the project. They were also substantially below the targets set at project appraisal.



- 10-
There was however, a temporary upward trend between 1986/87 and 1989/90 attributable to the
performance of class 94 locomotives which were commissioned in October 1987. The table
below refers:

52.   In terms of net surplus, financial performance substantially deteriorated in the early
years of the project but significantly improved during the final years of the project. Full
application of tariff freedom by the KR from 1991 helped to increase revenue whose rate of
growth kept pace with inflation. On the other hand tight expenditure control kept costs at
manageable levels. The table below shows the trend of revenue, expenditure, net surplus and the
working ratio over the project period.

Outlook
53.   At the end of the project, short-term liabilities exceeded available assets. Accumulated
arrears of interest and principal repayments increased to nearly Sh 7 billion calling for a major
financial restructuring. In this regard, a financial restructuring proposal is being drafted. Also
being drafted is a performance contract between the KR and the GOK. These two tools are
expected to facilitate a turn-around in the performance of the Corporation.

KENYA RAILWAY PROJECT PHASE II (STAP)
COMPLETION REPORT
ODA PROJECT COMPONENT
Introduction
1.     The second railways project comprised 3 elements: (a) Institutional development; (b) Motive
power; and (c) Operational improvements. ODA contributed £9.647m in parallel to the funds provided by
the World Bank and in support of a sector strategy. The allocation comprised two elements: (i) up to
£7.328 capital aid to finance rehabilitation of 15 locomotives, purchase of 50 wagons and 5 front end
loaders, and supply of communication equipment; (ii) up to £2.139m TC funds to finance 315 person
months of consultancy assistance in corporate management, management information, operations
management, locomotive maintenance, and workshop training.
2.     The objectives of the project were to assist Kenya Railways Corporation (KRC) in:
(a)    achieving organizational restructuring and more commercially oriented management
skills;
(b)    revitalizing its operating performance;
(c)    increasing the availability of motive power through locomotive rehabilitation and
improved maintenance facilities.
The wider objectives were to increase national transport capacity at lower unit cost, reduce
growth of heavy lorry traffic and improve the flow of traffic freight through the port of
Mombassa. To monitor and evaluate progress against the immediate and wider objectives a set of
performance and financial targets were agreed between KR, GOK, the World Bank and ODA.
3.     During negotiations between the Bank, ODA and KR a set of special project conditions were
agreed which ODA incorporated into the design of its project. The most important condition was KR and
GOK agreeing and signing a Memorandum of Understanding by 31 March 1988, incorporating, inter alia,
financial and operational targets for KR and compensation payments to KR in respect of uncommercial and
PSO type services operated by KR at the request of Government.
4.     The main ODA project components were implemented in the period 1988 - 91 and the project
was formally evaluated by ODA management in 1992. This report draws on the conclusions and
recommendations reached by the Evaluation Team updated in the light of developments since then and the
experience of ODA's African Railways Field Manager who has been an adviser to the project since 1989.
Project Implementation and Management
5.     Although the STAP study was completed in mid-1 995 the project was not approved by GOK until
1987 because of the problems in securing their agreement to the plan and in securing KRC agreement to
the amount and role of the technical assistance proposed. The issues underlying the MOU were not
directly addressed even then and full implementation of the project was further delayed until ODA had
commissioned an update of the corporate plan and a traffic costing study. These two issues, the question of
compensation claims and the role of TA, were never really resolved during the life of the project due to the
attitude of GOK and KRC and was one of the reasons for the project not fulfilling all its objectives.



-2-
6.     The contract for the loco rehab programme was awarded after competitive tender to BREL (1988)
Ltd. In order to bring the project within budget the number of Class 71/72 locos was reduced from 10 to 6.
It was also decided to use component reclamation techniques wherever possible rather than incur the cost
of new components unnecessarily. A project manager independent of the contractor was appointed. The
programme was difficult requiring 11 locos to be completed in 10 months and it is to the credit of all
concerned that it was achieved and within budget.
7.     The tender prices for the procurement of wagons and front end loaders were also substantially in
excess of the budget due to project delays since the original costing was done, resulting in the size of the
orders being reduced. Contracts for these and other capital equipment, communications and shunting
radios, were placed in 1989 and deliveries were completed by early 1991.
8.     The contract for the main STAP implementation consultancy was awarded to Coopers & Lybrand
in association with Transmark, the same partnership that won the contract for the IDA funded consultancy.
A project Coordinator was also appointed. As with the capital programme the TA inputs had to be reduced
to keep costs within budget. In total 134 man months of consultancy were provided between Sept. 88 and
June 9 1.
9.     Project savings, particularly unused contingency funds from the loco rehab programme were used
during the past two years to fund Class 46 and 47 shunter loco pilot re-engining exercises and various
studies e.g. Financial Restructuring, Performance Contract.
10.    The donors conducted six monthly supervision missions, comprising representatives from both
ODA and IDA with a mix of technical skills, to monitor and control progress on project implementation.
These missions were key elements in securing changes to the external environment in which KRC
operated. Although project conditionally was exerted through KRC, the leverage of the donors was
directed at securing change within GOK. The Supervision Missions also exerted considerable pressure on
KRC management on their achievement of performance targets.
11.    The role of the Project coordinator was key in terms of the donors monitoring and control of the
implementation of micro level components of the project. However, the ability of the PC to manage STAP
implementation was constrained by the inflexibility of the project design and because he had no authority
as a project manager. Reporting and monitoring procedures were generally in accordance with the Project
Memorandum.. The Consultancies submitted monthly and six monthly reports while the PC submitted
quarterly reviews on KRC's business, financial and operational performance against targets to MOTC,
Railway Monitoring Group and the donors, and six monthly reports which covered more detailed STAP
implementation aspects relating to individual components. These six monthly reports were timed to
coincide with supervision missions.
Impact and Sustainability
12.    By most objective measures, the conclusion reached by the February 1992 Supervision Mission
and the Evaluation Report that the project largely failed to achieve its objectives is inescapable. In many
respects the financial and operational performance was no better in 1992 than at the time of STAP
preparation. The operational position today is no better either as exemplified by the figures given in the
main body of the World Bank PCR, though there has been progress in the institutional developments
during the past two years.
13.    One of the principle reasons for the poor operational performance was the failure to secure
increases in locomotive capacity and reliability, attributed by KRC to a shortage of certain critical spare
parts. This was due to poor materials management and procurement processes. It is now generally
recognized that poor quality maintenance and lack of systematic analyses into causes of failure and the
identification and implementation of remedial action were also major contributory causes. These factors
seriously affected the sustainability of the locos ODA rehabilitated. Availability and reliability were, at



-3-
least initially, better than fleet average but performance soon deteriorated through a lack of spares and poor
maintenance. It was an omission by ODA not to include in the project an initial supply of running spares
for the locos. The decision to use post rehabilitation techniques has given lasting benefit and Central
Workshops have benefited from the technology transfer and uses the techniques on all classes.
14.    The other components of the OD capital programme had mixed success. The provision of the
hopper wagons enabled revenue earning wagons to be returned to traffic but had little impact on reducing
the backlog of p-way maintenance. With hindsight it is now apparent that the bulk liquid wagons and the
front end loaders were over specified. Operational use of the shunting radios has been disappointing and
while KRC have been generally satisfied with the performance of the PABX equipment some items
outstanding at commissioning in early 1991 are only now being resolved. The relative small size of each
of these components compared to the larger items and problems of the rest of STAP resulted in them not
receiving the attention they should have got. Some of the problems could have been overcome or
prevented by better co-ordination and project management.
15.    The technical assistance programme also met with mixed success. Many of the problems and
difficulties were common to the IDA TA component, viz:-
(a)    The two teams together created too large a presence at any one time, exceeding the
capacity of KRC to absorb advice and to implement recommendations and the capacity
of project management to effectively control all aspects of individual components. The
rate of change planned was too great and there was no management of change assistance
provided.
(b)    Inputs were designed inflexibly and with little cross departmental responsibility.
(c)    The effectiveness of the team was reduced by the inertia engendered in KRC by the
Presidential Inquiry and the subsequent change in execution management.
While there was little evidence of significant institutional development at the time except for the success of
the Accident Investigation Unit recent developments and revisions of the corporate plan has demonstrated
that KRC management are now more attuned to the future requirements of the business and that they are
more commercially orientated. This belated change in attitude is acknowledged as stemming from the
STAP TA programme, many of the concepts and principles promulgated at that time are now being
implemented.
Main Conclusions and Lessons Learned
16.    The objectives of the project, to effect a radical restructuring of KRC to improve technical,
financial, and operational performance, remain largely unfulfilled. The major causes of failure of the
project were those identified as risks at appraisal:-
(a)    Lack of GOK commitment and continued interference in KRC activities.
(b)    Lack of commitment by key staff within KRC for reform, with widespread resentment at
the imposition of TA within the corporation.
(c)    Lack of business management skills within KRC.
17.    Aspects of the project were poorly designed and failed to address the principle constraints on KRC
performance e.g. institutional reform focuses on efficiency issues only and ignored the importance of also
addressing socio-cultural and political aspects, the project focused on increasing revenue generating
capacity with insufficient emphasis on cost cutting strategies.

18.    The project exceeded the absorptive capacity of KRC. The TA programme was too large and too
many different areas were being simultaneously addressed leading to managerial problems in control of
the programme and in prioritization and implementation of the recommendations. Lessons for future
projects involving TA include:
(a)    The appraisal should ensure that TA can effectively address the problem and the
expected outputs should be specified rather than inputs.
(b)    TA inputs are more effective over short periods of time, task orientated and subject to
meaningful and monitorable targets.
(c)    The effectiveness of TA is enhanced by high calibre counterpart staff and where staff in
recipient departments accept problem ownership.
(d)    For large inputs more flexible delivery of TA should be considered with more use of
phasing and a project manager should be appointed.
19.    In the sense of restoring assets to operational use the loco rehabilitation objectives were met and
there were significant elements of technology transfer as a result of external support to the
Workshops. But there was no sustainable improvement in the effective motive power capacity of
KRC due to poor reliability caused by low quality maintenance and ineffective planning of spare
parts requirements. Rehabilitation programmes should include an initial stock of running spares.
20.    The donor strategy of target setting as a means of encouraging KRC to achieve better performance
was not effective. The targets were not necessarily consistent with each other and while some
targets were achieved the Corporation found itself being heavily criticized for its failure to achieve
others. The threat of invoking the projects conditionally clauses regarding nonperformance
resulted in project supervision missions assuming a confrontational aspect to the detriment of
progress. A better approach now being adopted is phasing, linking future project inputs to the
achievement of particular targets: this allows the recipient to make progress at its own pace,
provides an effective incentive for progress and encourages a team approach by donors and
recipient at progress meetings.
21.    KRC's management are now attuned to the future requirements of the business and a number of
important institutional and organizational developments have been successfully implemented
recently, but there is a long way to go before KRC is managed and operated as an efficient
commercial enterprise. STAP was a lost opportunity and GOK and KRC management have not
long to achieve the objectives and results before essential traffic is permanently lost to road
competition.
