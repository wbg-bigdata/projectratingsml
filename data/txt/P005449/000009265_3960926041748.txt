MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE KINGDOM OF MOROCCO
FOR A GREATER CASABLANCA SEWERAGE PROJECT
*         1.       The following report on a proposed loan to Morocco for the equivalent
of US$60.0 million is submitted for approval. The proposed loan would have a
term of 20 years, including 6 years of grace, at the standard IBRD variable
interest rate. It would support a sewerage project in the Greater Casablanca
area and sewerage master plans and feasibility studies in eight major urban
areas.
2.       Background.  Water is scarce in Morocco.  Existing groundwater
sources are becoming exhausted or are deteriorating in quality as a result of
over-exploitation.  Tre'ated surface water is therefore brought from greater
distances to supply the larger cities. Although about 80% of the urban
population receives piped water and about 302 of the rural areas has access to
piped water, most of the water supply systems insta'lled during the first half
of tlhc century need ugcnt repairs and rehabilitation to reduce water losses
and improve the service. These issues as well as institutional, financial and
administrative limitations pertaining to the water supply sector are addressed
in a recent National Water Supply Rehabilitation Project.
3.       Sewerage services, which have not kept pace with the development of
water supply, also need remedial attention. Although municipal sewage
collection systems exist in most medium and large cities, they have not been
extended to cope with the rapid growth of population and industries. The
organizational, financial and technical capabilities of the municipalities
which are responsible for sewerage services are limited. As a result, serious
pollution and health hazards have been created. Since 1977, the Government
has been examining ways to improve the sewerage sub-sector with assistance
from the Bank and has issued a sewerage policy statement emphasizing its
intentions to improve the environment by alleviating pollution and health
risks, and to strengthen the financial and institutional arrangements within
the sub-sector. The Bank's Sewerage Engineering Loan (Ln.S-7-MOR) financed
Sewerage Master Plan studies for the Greater Casablanca area which were
completed successfully in 1983. In 1984, the Government revised its financial
policy relating to the sewerage sub-sector by adopting the concept of total
self-financing of sewerage services. It also adopted a new sectoral policy
which is to progressively transfer the municipal sewerage operations to the
water supply R6gies ' throughout the country. The water supply R6gie of the
R6gies are public enterprises which supply water throughout Morocco, and
are expected to supply sewerage services eventually.



-2-
Greater Casablanca area (RAD) assumed responsibility for the municipal
sewerage services in iQ85 and is the main beneficiary of the proposed loan.
5.       Lessons learned from the Greater Casablanca Sewerage studies have led
the Government to entrust the R6gies with the responsibility for carrying out,
on behalf of the municipalities they serve, technical, institutional and
financial studies before taking over municipal sewerage services. The
technical and administrative capabilities of the Regies and the level of
pollution of the environment are key factors in identifying the urban areas
where the transfer of responsibility from municipal services to the Regies is
urgently required for the operation and maintenance of existing sewer
systems. The Regies of Agadir (RAMSA), Fes (RADEEF), Marrakech (RADEEMA),
Meknes (RADEEM), Nador (RADEEN), Rabat (RED), Settat (RADEEC) and Tangier
(RAID) have been selected by the Government to carry out sewerage master plan
and feasibility studies as the cities they serve are facing important issues
related to sewerage system maintenance and to pollution of the environment.
6.       Project Objectives.  The proposed project is designed to:
(i) promote the creation and development of appropriate institutional,
financial, and technical structures to manage sewerage services in major urban
centers; (ii) prevent further deterioration of the existing sewer systems in
the Greater Casablanca area through an extensive rehabilitation program;
(iii) keep abreast of the increasing domestic and industrial demand for
sewerage and storm drainage by the construction of additional facilities;
(iv) identify the least cost alternative for sewage treatment and disposal and
possible reuse of sewage effluent, while minimizing the environmental impact
of sewage effluent discharges; and (v) provide for effective operation and
maintenance of sewerage facilities and standardization in the quality of
design and implementation of sewerage extension works.
7.       Project Description.  The project, to be implemented over a nine year
period, includes the following components: (i) the provision of management
and technical assistance including training to RAD. This technical assistance
would be provided through a twinning contract recently concluded between RAD
and an international water supply and sewerage company; (ii) replacement of
about 60 km of primary and secondary sewers and three pumping stations;
(iii) inspection, mapping and cleaning of about 1,000 km of sewers, and
rehabilitation of about 200 km of sewers; (iv) construction of about 410 km
of new sewers and overflow structures for unserviced areas; (v) provision of
operation and maintenance equipment, training equipment and vehicles for RAD's
sewerage department; and (vi) sewerage feasibility studies to assess
alternatives for the treatment and disposal of sewage in the Greater
Casablanca area.  In addition, sewerage master plans and feasibility studies
including detailed design and bidding documents will be prepared for eight
major regional cities, i.e. Agadir, Fes, Marrakesh, Meknes, Nador, Rabat,
Settat and Tangiers.
8.       The total project cost (net of taxes and duties) is estimated at
US$95.2 million, with a foreign exchange component of US$33.4 million. A
breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts
and methods of procurement and disbursements, and the disbursement schedule
are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the
status of Bank Group operations in Morocco are given in schedules C and D
respectively. Two maps covering the project areas are attached. The Staff
Appraisal Report, No. 6472-MOR dated May 6, 1987, is being distributed
separately.



9.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank's overall involvement in
the water supply sector has been focussed on the strengthening of sector
planning and execution capabilities, cost recovery principles, pursuit of
sound financing mechanisms, and fostering the development of a strong
institutional framework.  In the sewerage sub-sector, the Bank's main
objective, supported by this loan proposal, is to help the Government develop
competent and finaneially viable institutions which would: (i) implement
sound policies and efficiently manage the sub-sector; (ii) adopt appropriate
financial policies and tariff structures; (iii) apply appropriate
technologies for sewage collection, treatment and disposal; and (iv) plan and
implement adequate expansion programs.
10.      Agreed Actions.  Agreement was reached on:
(i)    the immediate implementation of sewerage tariffs and fees to
generate revenues sufficient to finance all operating and
maintenance expenses, working capital requirements and debt
service and at least 40% of capital expenditures, not
prefinanced by consumers' and developers' contributions;
(ii)    technical assistance to RAD to carry out a training study and
initiate implementation of a sewerage training program by July
1, 1988;
(iii)    budgetary allocations sufficient to avoid a build-up of future
arrears from the public sector in the sewerage department of
RAD; and
(iv)    the recruitment of qualified consultants, by November 1, 1987,
to carry out sewerage studies for Agadir, Fes, Marrakech,
Meknes, Nador, Rabat, Settat and Tangier. The consultants'
recommendations will be submitted to the Bank for comments by
June 30, 1990 and the implementation of such recommendations
will be initiated by the Regies not later than January 1, 1990.
During negotiations, the Communal Infrastructure Fund (FEC) confirmed that it
will provide financial assistance in an amount equivalent to US$2.0 million to
the Regies of Agadir, Fes, Marrakech, Meknes, Nador, Rabat, Settat and Tangier
to finance their sewerage master plans and feasibility studies. Signing of a
financing agreement between FEC and a Regie would be a condition of
disbursement of the portion of the Bank loan related to that R6gie.  Signing
of an agreemen between a R6gie and the municipalities within which it
operates to carry out on their behalf their sewerage master plans and
feasibility studies would also be a condition of disbursement of the portion
of the Bank loan related to that Regie.
11.      Justification.  The project would decrease the exposure of the
population of Greater Casablanca to health risks from sewage ponding and
flooding. Extension of sewer networks would also contribute to the promotion
of housing development. In the longer term, the eventual installation of
sewage treatment and disposal facilities, which will be possible based on the
work completed under this loan, will alleviate pollution of the coastal waters
and beaches of Casablanca. Results from this project are expected to provide
the basis for replicating sewerage rehabilitation efforts in Morocco's major
cities.

12.      Risks.  The only risks are those associated with the establishment of
effective institutional management. However, these risks are minor,
particularly since a management and technical assistance contract between RAD
and an international water supply and sewerage company will supplement RAD's
technical and financial staff, and there is also provision for technical
assistance to the other eight Regies under the project.
13.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve this loan.
