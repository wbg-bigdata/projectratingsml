PUBLIC ENTERPRSE REFORM ADJUSTMENT LOAN II
Loan and  ram Summarv
The Argentine Republic
Beneilclar":      The Argentine Republic
Amount:           US$300 million equivalent
Terms:            Repyable in 17 years, including 4 years of grace, at the standard
variable rate.
Objectives:       The proposed loan which is an integral part e 'the Bank:s support for
the Argentine Government's adjustment program wfll assist in:
(i) privatizing/restructuring of public enterprises (PEs) in the Ministry
of Defense; (ii) reducing public finance deficits; and (iii) improving the
environment for competitive private sector activity and investment.
Benefts ad
Eskk:             The proposed loan would achieve the 'ollowing benefits for the
economT. (i) an improvement in public finances resulting from
governmental labor reductions and the elimination of subsides to PEs.
The PE losses in the Defense Complex were almost US$500 million in
1991, after subsidies of about US$200 million; and (ii) growth in
industrial activity stemming from increased and more efficient private
sector output and investment under a competitive business
environment. To ensure the private sector takes advantage of this
expanded scope, and some fiscal savings go to meet key social sector
needs, the authorities plan to retain Defense outlays at their present
low share of national income.
There are three types of risks associated with the delivery of the
progm. First in the short term, there are macroeconomic risks
stemming from continued domestic inflation and the fixed exchange
rate.         senior management changes have occasionally
undermined the program. Further changes could jeopardize the
timetable or even the programm. 1bir due to the continued perception
of a high level of county risk and the poor operating status of some
PEs, there might be limited interest by the international private
inmestors in some of these PEs.



Estlmated
Disbursement:      Ile loan would be disbursed in two tranches of US$200 million and
US$100 million. The first tranche includes a set-aside amounting to
US$100 million in support of Argentina's DDSR operation. Non set-
aside funds would be disbursed against eligible imports.
The first tranche would be available for disbursement following loan
effectiveness. The second tranche would be conditioned on continued
maintenance of macroeconomic performance, open trade regime, and
utilization of sales proceeds from the Defense area as previously
agreed, as well as specific sectoral actions: (i) forward satisfactory anti-
trust legislation to Congress for consideration; (ii) issuance of tax
credits to steel producers after accounts have been audited by
Direcci6n General de Impositiva; (iii) commence work on
environmental clean-up of closed PEs (METIOR and HIPASAM); (iv)
sell or dispose of the assets of SOMISA; (v) sell PGM and PBB; and
(vi) sell or close ten additional PEs in the Ministry of Defense.
Finad:             Retroactive financing up to US$40 million (20% of the loan amount
allocated to the adjustment program) is recommended for eligible
i'nports paid since June 1, 1992, about six months preceding expected
loan signing, in view of the Government's need for time to gather the
nece=sary import documentation for this loan while assembling similar
docu'mentation for other Bank and IDB SECALS

REPORT AD RECOMMMNDATION OF THE I ESIDENT
OF=THE INTENATIONA  BANK F)R RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPME
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOS
SECOND PUBLIC ENTERPRISE REFORM ADJUSTMENT LOAN IN AN AMOUNT
EOUIVALEIT TO US300 MLON    THE ARGEN     REPUBLIC
1.01        I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed
second loan to the Argentine Republic for the equvalent of US$300 milion to support an expanded
program of reform of public enterpnses; in particular those under the control of the Ministry of
Defe     Included in the loan, them would be a debt set-aside amounting to US$100 million in
support of Argentina's DDSR operation. Te loan would be at the Bank's standard variable interest
rate, with a maturity of 17 years, including 4 years of grace.
L RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMNTS AND PROSPECTS
A. Baclground
1.02        Upon taking office during the July 1989 hypeinflation, the Menem Government
recognized that rversing Argentina's economic decline required structura reforms to address the
source of endemic inflation, disinvestment and productivity declines. These included reforms to
eliminate chronic fiscal deficits, divest non-core fimctions of the public sector while improving the
supply of essential public goods, and teminate inefficient intervetions in markets.
1.03       ITe Govemnment launched major structural reforms in the federal govenment and
monetary authority, supported by the Bank's Public Sector Reform Loan (July 1991). These affected
revenue mobilization, expenditures, and financing of the public sector The VAT was extended to
viually all sectors in 1989-90. Tax rolls were reconstructed and tax administration was improved
substantially, producing higher revenues. Taxes on exports and (later) bank checks were eliminated
or reduced. Tax subsidies to industrial firms were brought under fiscal control and reduced. New
expenditure controls were enacted, and discretionary transfers to the provinces and to public
enterpises were reduced. The Government cut the size and scope of the federal public
administration-including a net retrenchment of positions of about 15 pecent and a transfer of about
40 percent of positions to the provinces-while modernizing the civil service. A Law of Public
Financial Management, passed by Congress in 1992, recast the basis for budgeting, internal control
and auditing. The Government also eliminated the quasi-fiscal deficit of the Central Bank by a forced
conversion of short-term, high-interest deposits into long-term dollar bonds bearing LEBOR-based
rates in January 1990, this reduced confidence in the financial sector for a short period. The recently
passed Central Bank charter reenforces the Convertiblity Law (see below), and paves the way for
an independent, disciplined monetary authority.
1.04        The Government also launched a major privatization program, supported by the
Bankls Public Enterprise Reform Adjustment Loan (February 1991). The first two laws enacted by
the Menem government suspended costly subsidies and provided authority to privatize virtually all
public enterprises. The measures in 1990-sae of 70 percent of telephone system, sale of
hydrocarbon concessions, and deregulation oi the hydrocarbon sector-lent much-needed early
credibility to the development strategy. The prvatization program continues, affecting the railways,
the state oil company, the power and water companies, ports, the merchant fleet, and enterprises
under the Ministry of Defense.



.2-
1.05        Tte Menem Government also implemented a trade liberalization program that was
started by the Altonsin Government in 1987, with the support of two Trade Po-icy Loans (1987 and
1988). Export taxes were eliminated and indirect tax reimbursements for exports established;
quantitative import restrictions were removed except for automobiles; specific import duties were
abolished, and the anti-dumping regime brought n line with the respective GA1T Code; the
maximum a valorem tariff rate was reduced to 20 percent. Beginning in 1991, the Govemment also
deregulated the supply and marketing of numerous goods and services, including professional,
transport and port services, thus reducing significantly the costs of doing business in Argentina.
Legislation increasing labor flexibility and improving collective bargaining has been enacted, and
further legislation is pending.
B. Macroeconomic Consolidation
1.06        By 1990, although inflation was still high and variable, the Gvernment had turned
an overall public sector primary deficit-6 percent of GDP in 1988--into a slight surplus. International
reserves rose significantly throughout 1990. Though a rise in inflation and a sharp devaluation
occurred at year-end, the pubi.s sector was much better positioned for the next stabilization program
than at any time during the 1980s.
1.07        The new stabilization program, begun in February 1991, included tax measures to raise
the fiscal surplus to a levesl obviating the need for inflationary financing, and further trade
iiberaLization to increase price discipline. In March 1991, the Government passed a Convertibility
Law that legally fixed the exchange rate at one peso to the US dollar, formally deindexed contracts,
facilitated the use of US dollars in transactions, and, most importantly, required the Central Bank's
mcnetary liabilities (the money base) to be matched by its international reserves. Money growth
therefore became effectively constrained to inflows in foreign capital, ending Central Bank financing
of deficits.
1.08        The policy package led to large capital inflows and a substantial fall in interest rates.
The expectations of exchange rate stability and the openness of the economy produced a sharp
deceleration in inflation, remonetization and, together with the fall in interest rates, an expansion of
consumer credit. Confidence was further bolstered in July 1991 with an IMF Standby and the Bank's
Public Sector Reform Loan; and later in the year with major advances in deregulation. Nominal
deposit rates fell to 10 percent per annum, the lowest level in 30 years. Stock market prices and
secondary market prices for Argentine external debt increased sharply, reflecting increased confidence
and declining intemational interest rates. The higher private capital inflows in 1991 financed a US$4
billion rise in imports (and corresponding reduction of the trade surplus) and an increase of US$2.7
billion in Uquid reserves. Led by consumption, the economy grew by 8.5 percent in 1991.
1.09        To provide a medium-term macroeconomic framework, the Government reached an
agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on a three-year program under the Extended
Fund Facility (EFF) in early 1992. The EFF program was designed around a primary surplus before
privatization (i.e., operational primary surplus) of about 2 percent of GDP. Together with the debt
and debt service reduction (DDSR) and with privatization proceeds, this would be sufficient to meet
debt service obligations without recourse to the inflation tax Fiscal performance to date has
exceeded EFF targets; tax revenues surpassed 25 percent of GDP in the third quarter of 1992,
compared to 15 percent in :988. The quarterly targets for the operational primary surplus were met,
and privatizations pushed the primary surplus over 3.5 percent of GDP. About US$2 billion was



-3-
realized from the sale of the Government's remaining 30 p<,rcent minority share in the telephone
companies.
LIO          To regularize its financing, the Government began negotiations with its commercial
bank creditors about a debt agreement in January 1992.' 1e Government also began regularizing
arrears with pensioners, suppliers, and the health system, as well as compensating taxpayers for
changes in the loss carry-forward provisions of the income tax through a new domestic bond
(BOCON). These measures have raised its domestic debt from about US$2.3 billion at end-1991 to
about US$18 billion at end-1992. Funds from the privatization of the state oil company are intended
to be used for repurchasing a major part of these bonds. Furthermore, an agreement with the
provinces has provided the Government with resources for increasing pension payments to legaly
mandated levels, ending the accumulation of arrears with pensioners. The Government has also
presented to Congress a social security reform law, which would introduce mandatory private pension
funds.
1.11         These policies were expected to generate about 6.5 percent real growth in 19M
Inflation, measured by the combined consumer and wholeprice index witl be about 12 percent for the
year, down from 2000 percent in 1990. Additional capital inflows have financed an increase in
reserves and a further US$6 billion rise in imports. Exports, however, grew at a slow pace. and the
trade balance, US$4.0 bitlion in 1991, may be negative in 1992 by more than US$1 billion.
1.12        The November 1992 Package.  The large capital inflows--a product of low
international interest rates and new confidence in Argentine policy-produced a real appreciation of
the peso of about 20 percent (based on the combined price index since the beginning of the
stabilization). Concerns about the trade balance prompted the Government in late October 1992 to
increase indirect tax reimbursements for exports from an average of 8 percent to 13 percent and rais
import tariffs-including ad valorem tariffs and a fiat statistics tax-from an average of 17 percent to
23 percent, while also reducing tariff dispersion. Reductions in fuel taxes further improved the
competitiveness of domestic producers. These measures produce an effective real devaluation of
about 5 percent.
C. Medlum-Term Prnspects and Financing Requirements
1.13        Following the economic recovery in 1991-92, the Government projects growth to
decline gradually to a long-term rate of about 4 percent annually, based on continued productivity
growth and new investment attracted by low inflation, an improved incentive structure, and reduced
country risk due to the implementation of the debt agreement. This outlook, however, depends on
continued fiscal improvement, and a smooth transition to a sustainable balance of payments as
presented in the EFF program.2
For a mor detailed discussion, see the President's Report on a prposed Debt and Debt Service Reduction Loan (Report
No. P-5914-AR) dated December 10, 1992.
2  The program is predicated upon consummating the Debt Agreement and these projections take into account the
Agrement.



.4-
1.14            Fiscal and Monezary Pclicv. The Government projects its operational puimary surplus
to increase from US$2.4 billion in 1992 to about US$4.4 billion in 1993, about 2.6 percent of GDP
(Table 1.1). This level would be sufficient to service interest payments, and to eliminate the need
for inflationary financing, given foresesable foreign and domestic borrowing. Identified finance to
the public sector would virtua}ly close the financing gap in 1993-2000, leaving only about 0.4 percent
of GDP in unidentified new borrowings, mainly in the outer years. Net domestic financing is
expected to be positive through 1996, and then turn sharply negative. This is because the
consolidation bonds (BOCONs) have a grace period on both principal and interest payments which
expires in 1997. Projected foreign financing, discussed below, is also expected to turn negative in the
middle of the decade. Howe-er, price stability and an improved payment record would allow the
Government to tap other private markets abroad and at home to finance any remaining gap in the
out-years. Argentina has already returned to voluntary borrowing througn bond issues in
international capital markets. Moreover, the Government also can expect to mobilize considerable
resources through the pension funds that would be generated by the social security reform.
1.15            The Government anticipates no change in its monetary and exchange rate policy,
which will continue to be disciplined by the Convertibility Law and the new Central Bank charter.
A tight fiscal stance, continuing import competition, and new entrants in heretofore oligopolistic
markets would drive domestic inflation to international rates.

1.16        Balance of Eayments. The Government's program relies on private capital inflows and
increasing private dlomestic savings to finance investment. Tight fiscal policy and passive but
predictable monetary policy would continue to make the investment in Argentine financial and real
assets attractive. Domestic interest rates would remain above international rates in real terms, while
domestic investment, wsth a rich unrealized potential, would otfer high returns for years. The
authorities view the estimated US$50.60 billion in private savings of Argentine residents held abroad
as a reliable source of future capital inflow, though perhaps slowing in 1993.
1.17        The commercial policy measures in November 1992-which increased the price of
imports and exports in pesosare intended to help switch resources from nontradeables back to
tradeables as demand for imports declines and demand for competing domestic goods and export
demand increase. This switch would be strengthened by continued productivity growth in the
tradeable sector due to the deregulation measures. Nominal wages in the nontradeable sector would
fail relative to the tradeable sector. Capital inflows would slow gradually. As the demand for
consumer credit weakens, credit would be channelled into investment in productive activities that
satisf the new demand in net exports and internationally competitve domestc activities. This
smooth process would not require a realignment of the nominal exchange rate. Growth could be
maintained, though at a lower level than during the 1991.92 recovery, and tax buoyancy would allow
the Govemment to attain revenues objectives. The resultng trade balance-and real exchange rate-
would be a reflection of capital inflows to finance imports and the demand for Argentine assets.
Reduced capital inflows in 1993 and beyond would imply lower import demand, and explain some
portion of the reductions in the growth rate. The Government anticipates that the trade balance will
improve progressively beginning in 1993.
1.18        External Einancing to the Balance of Payments. The capital account in the balance
of payments reflects the projectod changes in the net foreign asset position of the public and private
sectors. Ihe public sector's net external borrowing requirement is to be financei' from net increases
in ewosure from the international financial institutions, while bondholders and Paris Club members
reduce their exposure through partial rollovers. Much as with Mexco after its turning point in the
late 1980s, the World Bank would increase its exposure in Argentia, but not substantially after the
mddle 1990s, nor would the rDB. The IMFs exposure would decline after the expiration of the
extended afrangement. Private bondholders, including holders of BONEX, will be net recipients of
funds, though the Government expects to refinance roughy three-quarters of bonds coming due.
Commercial banks wfll be net recipients t3r funds on the debt that replaces existing arrears under the
DDSR agreement.
1.19        Ihe private sector is projected to increase substantially its net investment in Argentina.
Foreign direct investment is expectd to increase at about 8 percent annually, to average about
US$2.7 billion. Private short-term capital flows are projected to average about US$3.3 biUion-about
1.5 percent of GDP-to satisfy the demand for additional imports and domestic assets; this would
finance the projected current account deficit over 1993-2000. Since the Government has identified
virtually all of its financing, the actual financing requirement for the balance of payments wil be a
function of the desired savings-inestment balance in the private sector.
D. Atlative Possible Developments
1.20        The above scenario is attainable if the Government continues to improve its fiscal
position, and if the private markets allow a smooth transition to a sustainable balance of payments



-6-
and growth path. However, even with adequate ex ante fiscal adjustment, it should be recognized that
the Government may be unable to realize its growth projections. Slower growth or even a reession
could come about through two related mechanisms. On the one hand, an "overshooting" of capital
Inflows may drive up import volumes and prces of non-tradeables and domestic assets to
unsustainably high levels; then, as the correction ensued, private capital flows would taper off or even
reverse, pusing up domestic interest rates. (Rising international Interest rates, discussed below,
could also slow capital inflows shaply.) The higher domestic interest rates would dampen or even
extinguish growth. At the same time, domestic prices may be slow to converge to competitive
intenational levels, also contributing to the recession. Price setters, long used to mark-up pricing
in oligopolisc environmes, might take several months of slow sales before starting to cut prices to
the degree necessary to adjust the overall price level. Nonetheless, slower growth eventually would
produce the price convergence necessary to sustain the exchange rate regime and rekindle export-led
growth.
1.21          Rliks. A recession would create added fiscal pressure, with consequences that are
difficult to predict with cerainty. As revenues feil and the domestic interest bill roce, the speed of
the central government adjustment in reducing expenditures would determine the size of any increase
in the Government's net borrowing requirement. Any increase in the borrowing requirement would
make it more difficult for the Government to achieve the projected partial rollover of its domestic
debt with bondholders. A short recession would probably pose nDO major threat to the Government's
macroeconomic program, though modifications may be required; it would be unlikely to derail the
program of strucual reforms.
1.22          It also has to be recognized that a worsening macroeconomic panorama-or political
events-could trigger a speculadve attack on the p .  Ithe ease of capital mobility between
reences and across borders, superimposed on a small monetary base, means that the economy is
unsually vulnerable to sudden changes in private expectations and portfolio shifts. A sudden cycle
of den on, very high interest rates and deep recession could produce cracks in the financial
system. The Government might then be forced to choose between: (D providing emergency liquidity
to prevent the collapse of the financial system, thereby putting pressue on the exchange rate and
violating the convertbility law, and (ii) letting financi  institutions collapse with some depositors
sufferig losses, while shap increases in interest rates drive the economy into recession. In these
cicmstcs, ithe economic team would be under great pressure to change the policy framework. 3
1.23          The probability of these adverse events occurring declines as the  Government
progresses on reforms that improve the fundamentals of public finance, and as the implementation
of the debt agreement strengtens confidence. Also, reserves are the highest in a decade and cover

the monetary base (although not the deposit base). The high level of reserves tends to deter a
speculative attack on the peso. Regardless of any near-term turbulence, the emerging policy regime
would of necessity focus on maintaining fiscal balance and policies conducive to private investment.
Perhaps most important, recent history augurs well for the future economic management: the country
has enacted serious and difficult structural reforms; these have immense public support; the political
groups supporting the 1940-83 policies have seen their power dwindle; and the lack of alternatives
to fiscal discipline and price stability is widely accepted. These facts are powerful ballast that is likely
to keep the ship of structural adjustment headed in the same direction, even in a financial storm.
E. External Environment: Assumptions and Risks
1.24        Three aspects of Argentina's external environment affect the probability of realizing
the Government's scenario: the growth of the world's markets, commodity terms of trade, and the
cost of international capital. During the next 12 months, world growth is expected to recover at a
moderate pace. Following the stagnation of 1991, world output is projected to rise by 1 percent in
1992, and by 3 percent in 1993. ' Consequently, the volume of world trade slowed in 1991, but the
prospects for 1992-93 are better and with them the demand for Argentina's exports, which the
Government expects to grow at about 7 percent annually for the rest of the decade. Important
impeduments to a stronger performance remain. Several industrial countries require balance sheet
adjustments to unwind the effects of earlier speculative excesses in real estate and other asset
markets. In addition, the persistence of large budgetary imbalances in a number of countries
adversely affects business and consumer confidence. Divergences in economic policies among leading
countries is also contributing to discontinuities in selected financial and foreign exchange markets.
Major efforts to reduce fiscal imbalances are urgently needed in many countries to strengthen global
economic prospects, which would in turn provide greater opportunities for Argentina's exports.
125         Argentinaes terms of trade, after a 3 percent deterioration in 1992-93, are projected
to improve gradually as a result of the global demand conditions, according to Bank commodity price
forecasts. Real agriclltural and raw material prices have been relatively stable over the last three
years, hovering around 80 percent of their 1987 peak. The weakness in nonfuel commodity prices
is attributed to the recent decline in inflation worldwide, but grain demand is projected to rise
because of the increased demand for wheat in the CIS countries and low world grain stocks. Because
Argentina is energy self-sufficient, expected changes in fuel prices will have relatively small
macroeconomic effect.
1.26         Conditions in world credit markets will also affect Argentina's fiscal and balance of
payments position. A one percentage point change in international interest rates would produce a
US$600 million annual increase or decrease in its public interest bill. Although the demand for credit
has remained high because of persistent fiscal imbalances in the US, Germany, and other OECD
countries, the recession sharply reduced private credit demand; this, together with an easing of
monetary policy, brought interest rates to new lows in 1992. The IIBOR in 1992 was 3.8 percent,
half the 8.4 percent prevailing in 1990; the Bank projects a long term rate averaging 6.8 percent in
1993-2000. Reductions in the public demand for credit may ease the upward pressures on long-term
rates if the added fiscal efforts reduce existing budget deficits in she OECD countries. These external

rslks are mnageable, and are offset by the stronger domestic policy in Argentina and the DDSR
agreement which wilt fix the interest rate on nearly US$14 billion of Argentinaes extemal debt.
IL  PUBLIC ENTERISES IN ARGENTINA
A. The Public Enterprise (PE) Sector.
2.01         Whle PEs in Argentina did not account for a disproportionate share of the economy
(about 10 percent of GDP in the late 1980s) compared with other Latin American countries, their
inefficiencies and heavy losses had a profound economic Impact Furthennore, durng the past 40
years, government policies regarding PEs have created uncertaint, as they varied-from
nationalization, creation and growth, to a reduction of the public sector.
2.02         As of October 1991, there were about 220 PEs in Argentina, with about 26 percent
in the Federal Government (of which about 45 PEs were in the Defense Complex) and the remainder
under the ownership of provincial governments (65 percent) and municipal authorities (9 percent).
The PEs of the Federal Government were concentated in three major sectors:
(a) HIIDcarbons and E:ner. Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales (after corporatization
named *YPF"); Gas del Estado (GdE); Yacimientos Carboniferos Fiscales (YCF); Servicios
Electricos del Gran Buenos Aires (SEGBA); Agua y Energia Electrica (AyEE); and
Hidroelectrica Norpatgonia (HIDRONOR). SEGBA has been sold in segments; anl other
PEs in this sector are at various stages of implementing privadzatlon strategies;
(b) Transport and CoFtlon  Feriles Argentinos (FA); Empresa Nacional de
Correos y Telegrafos (ENCOTel); Empresa de Lineas Maritimas (ELMA); and Asociacion
Geal  de Puertos (AGP).  Privatizons were completed with respect to Aerolineas
rgentinas (AA) and the national telephone company (ENTel); the others are at various
stages of pdvatzaton; and
(c) Ildustrl and Service Sectors: PEs in the steel, petochemical, shipyards, aviation, and
other industrial entitles under the ownership of the Minstry of Defense; the prvtization of
these PEs is the subject of the proposed loan.
2.03         The supeisy framework for PEs in Argentina has been constady evolving, but by
1991, viruay all Federa PEs are under the direction of two Mnistries -the Mistry of Economy
controlling the most important block (roughly 90 perceat of revenues), and the Ministry of Defense
(rougly 7 percent of revenues).
2.04         Much of the inefficiency of the PEs in Argentia stems from their diverse interests.
Foremost among the Interested patties are private suppliers or purcss that have enjoyed
mnmerous privileges; these have enabled them to extract the maximum "rentsfrom PEs. Labor unions
have extracted special privileges from PEs, and political parties have used PE appointmet  as
rewards for party affiliations and financing. During the 1980s, expditues, particularly investment
by PEs, mirrored the general economic decline. Public nvestnent as a percent of Gross Domesdc
Investment (GDI) has been dedlfning. In 1988, public investment represented 54 percent of GDI;



-
in 1991 it was less than 35 percent. Initial efforts by the Covernment to implement its public sector
reform program are now showing positive results: the PEs' borrowing requirement in 1991 was 1.5
percent of GDP (about US$ 2 billion), while for 1992 it is projected at 1.1 percent of GDP.
2.05        Aware of previous failures of partial reform measures, the Govcrnment concluded that
success in PE reform required wholesale changes in contractual relationships between PEs, customers,
suppliers, labor unions, and the central government. Such radical change left no option but to tackle
vested interest groups head-on and to press for results on an accelerated timetable. Ihe Argentine
Government (and President Menem personally) has made the sale and closure of PEs a centerpiece
of its efforts to reform the structure of the economy, President Menem has demanded that all PEs
be privatized before the end of 1992. Indeed Argentina is engaged in one of the most ambitious
privatization programs in the world. The objectives of the program are to: (a) reduce the size of the
state, public debt, and deficits; (b) increase production efficiency and improve the quality of services;
and (c) promote private sector investment.
2.06        The 1989 Law for the Reform of the State (Law 23,696) empowered the Government
to reorganize, privatize, or liquidate PEs principally under the control of the Ministry of Economy.
Each of these activities has been executed by the responsible secretariat-in-charge of the assets; the
Congress now supervises the process through a Bicameral Commission consisting of six members from
each Chamber. In 1991, Congress extended the Reform Law to include PEs under the Ministry of
Defense (Law 24,045).
2.07        As of September 1992, the privatization program had collectively contributed to a debt
reduction of US$7.7 billion, about 20 percent of total commercial bank debt outstanding. In addition,
the cash realized amounted to US$4.5 billion (Annex II). The biggest contribution to the National
Treasury has resulted from the privatization of the telephone and oil enterprises.
B. Reform Progress of PEs under the Mnistry of Ecanomy
2.08        Unlike most other countries, the Argentine Government started its restructuring and
privatization program with four of the largest PEs-ENTel, AA, YPF, and FA--which collectively
account for two-thirds of total PE employment and revenues and half of the total public enterprise
operating deficit. The sale of the first two PEs served as "demonstration cases' and proved the
Government's commitment to reform.                               0
2.09         Early privatizations experienced some difficulties with the investor community. In the
case of ENTel, the consortium of Bell Atlantic and Manufacturers Hanover failed to meet its
payment deadline and was forced to pull out. In the case of AA, the consortium led by Iberia initially
failed to meet both the deadline for its second down payment of US$130 million and the delivery of
US$1.6 billion of debt paper for the 85 percent shareholding in the airline. While these problems
were subsequently resolved, Iberia (the only bidder) had strong leverage during the negotiations.
2.10         Based on its demonstration cases, the Menem Government has further deepened the
reform program to eatend to other major infrastructure PEs (Power, Water Supply, Ports and
Shipping) for which it also requested Bank assistance. Beyond supporting PE privatizations under
the first PERAL, the Bank is assisting the Government with the privatization of SEGBA, Obras
Sanitarias de la Nacion (OSN), as well as concessions of the toll roads. IDB is assisting the



- 10-
Government with a quick-disbursing, policy-based loan of US$314 million (including US$14 million
of technical assistance) for two PEs in the power sector-HIDRONOR and AyEE.
211           Annex Im shows the status of the Ministry of Economy's PE privatizations. A
summary of the efforts and results is as follows:
* In the hydrocarbon sector, Congress has approved two laws - uLy de Federalizacion
de Hidrocarburos y Transformacion de YPF" and a law which provided for the
establishment of a regulatory framework for the gas sector. Sale of YPFs oil reserves
to-date has yielded about US$1.5 billion. In the case of Gas del Estado, sales
memoranda have been issued for the North and South gas pipeline transmission
systems and eight distribution centers. Sale of Gas del Estado is to be completed in
the first quarter of 1993.
*     In the power and public services sectors, the privatization of SEGBA has been
concluded; two generation plants have already been sold for about US$180 million
representing 60 percent of the stock value, and 51 percent of the transmission and
distrbution companies-EDENOR and EDESUR-created by the spin-off of SEGBA
have been sold to consortia of private investors on August 31, 1992. The Technical
Commission in charge of privatization of "Obras Sanitarias de la Nacidn" on
September 11, 1992, prequalified four private consortia interested in operating the
water system in Buenos Aires. The concessions are expected to be awarded by end-
December 1992.
*     In the transport sector, concessions have been awarded for the Rosario-Bahia Blanca,
General Mitre, Urquiza, San Marti, and Roca railway cargo lines, and 25 percent of
the interurban highway system has been turned over to private toll operations. In the
case of the metropolitan railroad system of Buenos Aires (including the Metro), the
Government is in the process of evaluating bids from private investors. In addition,
about 9,000 kilometers of railroads are being transferred to the provinces for their
direct operation or concession to third parties. The sales memorandum for ELMA
(the national shipping company) was issued and no offers were received. The
Government re-issued the sales memorandum in October 1992 for its second calL If
there are no interested bidders for the second call, the Government would liquidate
the PE.
o     In the communications sector, the authorities have decided to partially divest the mail
system, ENCOTel (51 percent of the shares will be retained by the State). A
consulting firm has been selected to advise ENCOTel on preparing a restructuring
plan for partial divestiture.
2.12        By June 1991, the total labor reductions associated with restructuring of the PEs
within the control of the Ministry of Economy were about 21,000. The Ministry estimates about
77,300 more employees will become redundant when the process is completed. This represents a 35
percent reduction from June 1991 PE employment levels, and will cause a labor indemnity cost of
about US$750 million. Annex IV shows the labor reduction for each of the PEs within the Ministry
of Economy.

2.13           It is still too early to analyze increases in production efficiency, improvements in the
quality of services, and the promotion of private sector investment activity stemming from the selected
privatizations completed-ENTel, AA, FA and petroleum reserves. Three lessons have been learned,
however; (i) establish a functioning regulatory agency (if required) and clarify "rules of the game"
prior to sale; (ii) ensure competition from multiple bidders; and (iii) credit highly the importance of
an honest and committed senior management. Table 2.1 below shows the key lessons learned for
each of the major PEs:

2.14          The problems created by a lack of appropriate regulatory agency/framework before
privatization are exemplified by the telecommunication sector: decisions related to tariffs review, cellular
telephone licenses, satellite services and radio-frequency spectrum management are still awaiting decision
by the Comisidn Nacional de Telecomunicaciones (CNI). After ENTel's privatizaton CNT did not
operate effectively, so the Government intervened and relieved the Commissioners. A new Subsecretary
of Telecommunications was appointed, who with Bank support retained consulting firms to temporarly
undertake the responsibilities of CNT. New Commissioners appointed since then are building up the staff
and the capacity of the commission.
C. Reform Progress of Other PEs
2.15           Another group of PEs are public financial institutions and PEs under the management of
provincial governments and municipal authorities. These PEs are also being restructured, liquidated and
privatized under the overall mandate of the reform program. For instance, the National Development
Bank (BANADE) is being liquidated (operations halted; staff reduced; most branches closed); the Savings
and Insurance Bank (Caja Nacional de Ahorro y Seguros) is being privatized, and the Mortgage Bank
(BHN) is being converted into a second-tier institution. Banco de la Nacion is being rationalized and is
undergoing major staff reductions. The Government is committed to encourage privatization and
reorganization of other financial institutions, while the Central Bank will provide temporary liquidity

credit only to solvent banks. Bank technical assistance has supported these actions as well as
restructuring by some provincial banks. A Financial Sector Adjustment Loan has been negotiated with
the Argentine Governent to support these reforms. Provincial and municipal authorities, which
collectively account for 74 percent of the PEs, are also downsizing their portfolio through privatizations,
and these actions are expected to be supported by a forthcoming Bank loan.
ImI. PE REFORM PROGRAM OF THE MI1NISJRY OF DEFENSE
A. Introduction
3.01         Argentina's Ministry of Defense is undertaking the restructuring and privatization of
virtually all enterprises within the Defense Complex. In October 1991, the Ministry was reorganized,
consolidating responsibilities and fimctions under two Secretares - the Secretary of Military Affairs and
the Secretary of Planning. The Secretary of Planning will concentrate on the PE reform program. The
Under Secretary of Restructuring and Asset Management, who reports to the Secretary of Planning, is
responsible for liaising with the Bank on the defense reform program.
3.02         A large number of PEs came under the tutelage of the Defeise Complex due to their
"strategic' importance and the evolving role of past Military Governments. Although the PEs are in
disparate industrial sectors, the unifying theme is that these PEs are related in both their defense and
regional activities. For instance, Altos Hornos Zapla and HIPASAM were established in the frontier
provinces of Jujuy and Rio Negro respectively to meet the military's needs for the supply of specialized
steel products. Because of their original strategic importance, these PEs were not subjected to the rigors
of the marketpidce and most of the senior management appointments were filled with non-commercially
oriented military staff.
B. Composition of PEs within the Defense Complex
3.03         The proposed loan addresses 24 of the total 45 PEs whithin the Defense portfolio. Annex
V shows the overall list of PEs within the Ministry. The twenty-one PEs excuded from Bank support
are: (a) six PEs liquidated prior to March 1991 (before the Bank's involvement); (b) eleven PEs that are
strictly defense related, although they are subject to privatization under Law 24,045/91; and (c) four PEs
that had their shares recently transferred from the Air Force to the Ministry of Defense (Decree 161/92).
3.04         The 24 industrial-oriented PEs are grouped under four broad sectoral activities: (a) steel;
(b) petrochemicals; (c) shipyards; and (d) other manufacturing enterprises. These industrial PEs are the
most important in terms of economic activity within the Ministry of Defense: their assets, employees and
sales account for about 90 percent of the total portfolio. Amongst them, the steel sector is the most
important, accounting for about 50 percent or more of the employees, assets and sales of the combined
Defense PEs. Furthermore, the steel sector is the most complex in terms of labor unions, vested private
sector interests, and policy distortions. Figure 1 shows the sectoral allocation of selected financial
indicators:

C. Financial Performance
3.05         The main obstacles to privatization has been the PE-s' poor financial performance,
overstaffn, and the assessment of still-high country risk faced by prospectve investors. The finacial
information excludes PEs sold/liquidated prior to March 1991, and Area Materia Cordoba, an aircrft
company, which was not legally organized as a corporation. During 1991, the losses of Defense PEs for
which data are available amounted to about US$480 million, of which US$250 million was for SOMISA
alone. These losses were about 0.3 percent of 1991 GDP and equalled 16.4 percent of the total required
borrowings from the Government in 1991. Of the 22 PEs for which financial, data are available, only
6 PEs were profitable; PBB showed a profit of US$75.5 million for 199 1. The book-value of their assets
was US$4.2 billion, and their liabilities were US$ 1.8 billion; however combined sales last year were only
uStSoo million, less than one-fifth the asset value. Annex VI shows the finacial performance of the
major PB  within the Defense Minstry. Some of the reasons for poor financial performance are: (a)
the elimination of the budget transfers from the Treasury, which increased inter-PE payment obligations;
(b) selected private firms have not paid some PEs for their purchases; (C) the near collapse of the
domestic market has necessitated exports at below cost prices in some cases; and (d) overstaffig and
limited investments have forced cerain enterprises into obsolescence and uncompetitive cost positions.
Figure 2 shows the financial performance of the PEs within the Defense Complex:

3.06         There is also the burden of strictly defense-related outlays on the budget. In 1988,
Argentina allocated 3.1 percent of GDP to defense expenditures, compared to 3.3 percent for health and
education combined. Faced with growing social hardship and slow growth, the Government embarked
on an ambitious program to reduce its defense expenditures (excluding pensions) to only 1.9 percent of
GDP in 1991, with a lower level budgeted for 1992. All public expenditures, of course, have fallen
relative to GDP during the past few years, but military expenditures have fallen faster. Defense spending
was US$1.9 billion in 1985 and was reduced to US$582 million in 1990 (constant 1985 dollars), a
decrease of 69 percent. The Government's strategy is that as public outlays rebound, military
expenditures will grow much more slowly, so the increment can be passed to the civilian, especily
social, sectors.
D. The Privatizathon Program.
3.07 The Government has decided that virtually all PEs within the Ministry of Defense's purview will
be privatized i.e. sold, or closed. Due to the complexity and multiplicity of these PEs, the Government
requested Bank assistance-technical and financial-to achieve a broader set of objectives beyond the
reduction of state activity. Based on lessons learned from the privatizations completed, the Minister of
Defense, formerly Minister of Economy, appointed a Secretary for Planning who is responsible for the
day-to-day management of the reform program. The Secretary of Planning is assisted by two Under
Secretaries-Privatization and Restructuring and Asset Management. This senior management team is
supported by govermnent staff and technical consultants. To the extent issues of economic policy arise
(e.g., competitiveness, environment), other areas of Govermsent have also been involved as well.



- 15 -
3.08        Due to the poor financial performance of most of the PEs and their relative
unatactiveness, the Government has developed a two-pronged approach. First, a number of PEs in
financial distress but which may be viable were rationalized (without investments) prior to privatization.
Second, those PEs with no hope of viability, even after rationalization, were closed. The Ministry's
rationalization efforts are limited to assuming liabilities resulting from labor indemnity costs, write-
down or assumptions of debt, and settlement of inter-PE transfers. Beyond these liabilities, the
Government wuill not incur additional investments to improve the value of the PEs prior to sale.
3.09         The labor reduction of PEs within the Defense Complex is estimated at about 19,600
of a total 32,300 staff; a reduction of about 60 percent relative to September 1991 levels. At an
average indemnity cost of US$15,000 per worker, the total cost of indemnification for Defense PEs
is US$286.2 million. As of September 1992, 70 percent of the total labor reduction has been
accomplished, mainly due to a US$181.9 million bridge loan received from Banco de la Nacion.
Other rationalization costs, associated with plant closures, including satisfactory environmental
cleanups would be identified on completion of environmental audits or will be identified (for plants
already closed) by Government consultants.
3.10         On completion of the PEs' rationalization, or in cases where PEs are already viable,
the Government has retained the services of international consultants or merchant bankers to assist
in the preparation of the sale. The selection of these financial advisors has been undertaken in an
open and transparent manner and according to international practices.
3.11         Following is a description of the Ministry's privatization program in each of the four
major sectors:
Steel: The Defense Ministry will end its interest in all three steel PEs. HIPASAM has been
closed due to non-viability. Because of prior pollution problems, the Government will
undertake an environmental audit of HIPASAM and incur the required outlays for its
environmental cleanup. The Government, with the assistance of IFC as its financial advisor,
has sold AHZ to an international consortium of Aubert and Duval, Societe IndustriaDe de
MetalturgLe Avancee (SIMA), Citicorp Venture Capital, SA Pensa, S.A. and Penfin, SA
The total value of the sale was US$33.2 million, 10 percent in cash and the balance in debt
conversion instruments.
Ihe third steel PE--SOMISA--is the largest integrated steel mill in Argentina with an instaDed
capacity of 2.2 million tons producing both flat and non-flat steel products, about 60 percent
of the country's total capacity. The Government retained the services of an international
merchant banker to assist in the privatization of SOMISA under Bank financing. The sales
memorandum was issued in August 1992, and a consortium of local and regional steel firms
that bid US$152.1 million was awarded the company in November 1992.
Chemicals and Petrochemicals: There are fourteen chemical and petrochemical related PEs
under the control of the Ministry of Defense; the Gowvernment plans to sell or close all of
them. Argentina has a comparative advantage in this sector due to the ready availability of
gas feedstock and a sophisticated indristrial base. The most important PEs in terms of size
and assets are PBB and PG?VL



-16-
PBB, a manufacturer of ethylene, is 51 percent owned by the govemment, while the
remaining shares are owned by the downstream private producers Although PBB is
competitive, its current installed capacity of 230,000 tons is considered sub-scale by most
international investors, even though it dominates the Argentine ethylene market. Using Bank
financing, the Government has retained the services of an international merchant banker to
assist in the privatization of PBB. An arbitration process has been underwav for sometime
between the Government and the downstream private owners to resolve pending legal issues,
involving unpaid bills and credits. Nevertheless, the Government has issued the sales
memorandum in November 1992, without resolution of the arbitration issues, and has ensured
that any adverse decision will be absorbed by the Government, not by the new owners. Sale
is to be completed by the second quarter of 1993, particularly if the arbitration decision is
agreed by early 1993.
PGM, a manufacturer of olefins and aromatic petrochemicals, is totally government-owned
with the Ministry of Defense owning 50 percent and YPF the remainder. An international
merchant banker has been selected to assist the Government in its privatization; it is being
financed by the Bank. The sales memorandum was issued in mid-October 1992, and the sale
is to be completed by the first quarter of 1993.
Five PEs in which the Government had minority ownership interests already have been
divested to the existing private shareholders. One otLer PE-METEOR-hus been closed due
to non-viability. Because of previous major pollution problems, the Government will
undertake an environmental audit of METEOR and incur the required outlays for its
environmental cleanup. The Government has issued sales memoranda and evaluated bids for
three other PEs-Carboquimica, Fo4ia, and FM Tolueno-and has awarded winning bids to the
respective private investors.
Shipyards: There are three shipyards--Tandanor, AFNE, and Domecq Garcia. Tandanor has
been sold to an international consortium consisting of Banco Holandes Unido, CIAMAR, and
Sud Marine Enterprises for a price of US$59.8 million. One other shipyard, Domecq Garcia,
contains partia  completed submarines which the Argentine Navy now neither wants nor
needs. AFNE, a diversified shipyard facility located on Rio Santiago, constructed oil tankers
principaly for YPF, frigates for the Argentine Navy, and small size cargo ships ranging in size
from 8,000 - 15,000 tons capacity. Because of high labor costs and obsolete technologies,
demand for Argentine ships has declined. Furthermore, given their military orentation, the
Government has been working with the Navy and the provinces in determining their future
privatization options. In the case of AFNE, a resolution was issued in October 1992, that
permits the continued reduction of its workforce.
Other Industrlal PEs: There are six other major industrial PEs-Area Material Cordoba, FM
ECA, FM San Francisco, FM San Martin, TAMSE, and Domingo Matheu. At leat four are
to be privatized. In the case of FM ECA, the Government has retained the services of IFC
to assist in its privatization. The sales memorandum was issued in October 1992 and the PE
is to be sold by the fist quarter 1993. In the case of Area Material Cordoba, the
Government is in the process of retaining an investment banker to assist in its privatization.
Since this entity was an administrative part of the government, not a legal corporation, the
Government has completed the required legal steps for its incorporation. For the remaining
four PEs, Government staff will prepare the necessary documentation for their privatizations.

IV. THE PROPOSED  OAN
A. Rationale for Bank Involvement
4.01         This proposed US$300 million SECAL would support the privatization of all civilian
Defense PEs and those in advanced stages of conversion to civilian use. PEs supported by the
PERAL II account for 97 percent and 91 percent respectively of all sales and empityment, within
the Ministry of Defense. It would not include technical assistance components. Part of a prior
Japanese Grant has been allocated to this program; in addition the Government of Japan recently
approved another 1168.75 million (about US$1.4 million equivalent) grant specificaDly for TA to the
Defense Complex. The Public Enterpnrse Reform Execution Loan (PEREL) also includes
US$1,750,000 in technical assistance funds for the Defense PE reform program. The combined TA
funds available to the Ministry of Defense from PEREL and Japanese Grant Facilities amounts to
about US$4.2 million. The utilization of these technical assistance funds for the various initiatives
is delineated in Annex "IL
4.02        The Bank has a comparative advantage for such work because of its: (a) prior
knowledge of the major sectors within the Defense portfolio; (b) ability to help develop competitive
policy environments for private sector participation; and (c) ability to design greater transparency and
credibility in the privatization process. Over the years the Bank has been involved in developing
restructuring strategies for three major industrial PEs in the Defense Complex--SOMISA, PBB, and
PGM-representing more than two-thirds of the Complex's total book value. Bank staff and
consultants have made special efforts to assist in both improving the competitive environment for the
affected sectors and ensuring environmental dangers are avoided. Without Bank technical assistance
and the financial support under the proposed loan, the Government might not have begun or
expected to complete the restructuring and privatization of PEs within the Defense complex.
B. The Pr6posed Loan
4.03        The US$300 million loan would be disbursed in two tranches; a first tranche of
U ;$200 million, including a debt set-aside amounting to US$100 million, and a second tranche of
US$100 million. PERAL II wil focus on reducing the role of the state in key industries under the
tutelage of the Defense complex. In order to increase the enterprises' privatization potential, a large
number of PEs need to be rationalized without new investnents by the govenment prior to
privatization. The Ministry of Defense will reduce the labor force by an estimated 19,600 workers
(Annex VIII).
C. Project Implementation
4.04        Executing Authority. The Borrower would be the Argentine Republic; the Ministry
of Defense would be the Executing Agency. The Under Secretary of Restructuring and Asset
Management, Ministry of Defense, would be responsible for coordinating and liaising with the Bank
on the reform program. Furthermore, the Under Secretary would be responsible for maintaining all
records pertaining to the Ministry of Defense's staff reduction program. At the PE level, the
respective chief executives ('Interventors") will be responsible for implementing the reform program.



.18-
4.05        Disbursement and Procurement. Excluding the set-aside funds, the proposed loan
would finance 100 percent of the CIF costs of general imports, excluding luxuwry goods, military
equipment, petroleum products and foodstuffs above US$50 million, and enivironmentally hazardous
products defined under the Standard International Trade Classification (ST). Imports prior to June
1, 1992, and expenditures for goods procured under contracts costing not less than US$5,000
equivalent would not be eligible for Bank financing. This threshold would be consistent with
satisfactoty access by small- and medium- size importers, and the operation would still remain
manageable from an administrative point of view. Retroactive financing would be acceptable up to
US$40 million (20 percent of the loan amount allocated to the adjustment program) for eligible
imports since June 1, 1992, about six months preceding expected loan signing in view of the
Government's need for time to gather the required import documentation necessary for this loan
while assembling similar documents for other Bank and IDB SECALc. For commodity imports under
existing contracts, relevant expenditures would qualify for reimbursement under the loan in an
amount not to exceed the reference average per unit FOB price published in international commodity
markets, as applicable on the date of loading. The closing date of the loan would be June 30, 1994.
4.06        In December 1991, a Bank mission reviewed procurement procedures related to the
Bank's adjustment operations in Argentina. It concluded that the public sector, Government
Agencies, Autonomous Entities, and large private frins follow competitive procurement practices fully
acceptable to the Bank However, small and medium sized firms with limited international exposure
do not normally follow acceptable procurement procedures.
4.07        Therefore, imports of the Ministries, public enterprises, and private importers of US$5
million equivalent or above would be procured through simplified ICB procedures in accordance with
Bank guidelines. This threshold would be consistent with the anticipated sizes of contracts and the
experience of the borrower with Bank procedures. Procurement for contracts below this threshold
will be as follows: (a) public sector contracts below US$5 million equivalent may be carried out
according to the standard procedures of the purchasing institutions; and (b) private sector contracts
below US$5 million equivalent may follow established commercial practices acceptable to the Bank
and require a minimum-price quotation by eligible suppliers from at least two countries Direct
contracting is appropriate only under the conditions specified in the Bank Group's procurement
guidelines.
4.08        Accounting and Auditing: The Ministry of Economy would be responsible for
maintaining loan accounts, and for preparing and submitting withdrawal applications. Disbursements
from the proposed loan would be made on the basis of a summary from the Ministry of Economy
detailing individual import transactions in each relevant period, together with a certificate of payment
of the amount involved and of eligibility under the loan. Applications for withdrawals will be
consolidated and submitted in amounts not less than US$1 million. Contracts valued at above US$5
million equivalent would be disbursed against full documentation; disbursements would be made
against statements of expenditures for contracts below that sum. The Ministry of Economy will
maintain separate accounts to record and monitar loan disbursements and repayments. All records
and accounts will be audited in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and submitted
within six months following the end of the financial year.

D. Loan Condltions
4.09        The proposed loan is conditioned on three sets of actions: (a) satisfactory economic
environment, both of macroeconomic performance and key sectoral economic conditions; (b)
privatization of the steel sector, and (c) privatization of all industrial civilian-related PEs. The policy
matrix in Annex IX provides the specific, proposed conditions. The three major sets of loan
conditions are:
(i)    Satisfactory Economic Environment.  First, the Government would maintain
satisfactory macroeconomic performance and a public expenditure program consistent
with the IMs EFF and the detailed Letter of Development Policy (Annex X). A
series of important sectoral conditions, which also support the goals of the EFF
program, were or are supported in the undisbursed tranches of the Provincial Loan,
PSRL, PERAL I, and the proposed Financial Sector and Provincial SECALs. The
proceeds of asset sales will be used to reduce debt (extemal and internal) or for labor
indemnification rather than spent on recurrent costs.
Secondly, there are some key sectoral economic conditions that must be met if the
privatization process and private sector development is to succeed. First, the current
competition policy of Argentina was limited in its enforcement capabilities and scope.
The law does not sufficiently address issues related to market conduct and structure.
To further strengthen the competitive policy environment, the authorities retained a
team of intemational consultants who drew up revised anti-trust legislation which will
be forwarded to Congress for approvaL Moreover, another way to ensure keen
competition is to retain an open trade account, particularly for such homogeneous
products as steel and petrochemicals. It was agreed with the authorities that the low
maximum tariffs would not be increased and that no new QRs will be issupd,
particularly on steel and petrochemical products. The MERCOSUR (Argentina,
Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay) agreement is being implemented. Already two
regional tariff cuts have occurred, and free regional trade is expected to occur by
January 1995. The authorities have reiterated their intention to move towards free
regional trade in the Letter of Development Policy.
In addition, the generous fiscal incentives given to existing steel producers must also
be reduced if new purchasers are to be attracted to these sectors. Ihis latter issue
is also being addressed in the PSRL under the Industrial Promotion Control Program.
The Government has already issued a Decree No. 27.513 which outlined the
elimination of the fiscal incentive program.
(i)   PrIvatization of the Steel Sector. The steel sector is treated separately because of
its importance in the Defense portfolio. All three PEs in the steel sector have been
or will be privatized or closed. The Government has already issued a deregulation
decree liberalizing barriers to entry and reducing non-tariff restrictions and has
undertaken major steps in rationalizing SOMISA (halved the workforce, curtailed the
production of loss-making product lines, placed auxiliary unproductive assets for sale,
and overcome strong resistance from unions, suppliers, and purchasers). The
Government, with the assistance of IFC, has sold AHZ and closed HIPASAM In the
case of SOMISA, the authorities issued the sales memorandum incorporating the



-20 -
principles of competitive strategy consistent with its obligations under the
MERCOSUR treaty.
(l)  Privatiatloon of all other PEs and the Conversion of Defene-related Activities ito
Civllian Use within the Defense Complex. To date, six PEs have been sold and a
number of others are in the final stage of privatization. In the case of three PEs-
Carboquimica, Foria, and FM Tolueno-bids submitted by private investors are being
evaluated. In at least four of the PEs-TAMSE, ECA, FM San Francisco, and FM
San Martin-their conversion from military to civflian use have been completed and
sales memoranda have been issued. -he most important PE in terms of industial
structure is PBB. Therefore, its sales memorandum has been prepared so as to
incorporate the principles of competitive strategy consistent with Argentine
obligations under the MERCOSUJR treaty. Fmally, PGM's sales memorandum has
also been issued.
4.10        The conditions for second tranche release are: (a) continued maintenance of the 3-
year macroeconomic program-including fiscal targets, open trade policies, and use of privatization
sales proceeds--and compliance with the budget; (b) forward satisfactory 'competition" legislation to
Congress for consideration; (c) issuance of tax credits to steel producers after accounts have been
audited by DGI; (d) commence work on environmental clean-up of selected closed PEs; (e)
sale/disposal of SOMISA's assets; (f) the sale of PGM and PBB; and (g) the sale/closure of at least
10 other PEs.
E. Environmental Aspects.
4.11        A number of PEs within the Defense Complex have caused adverse environmental
effects. New legislation and enforcement mandating better environmental standards are pending,
possibly making the PEs financially less attractive to potential private investors. The Ministry of
Defense in conjunction with the newly appointed Secretary of the Environment would undertake
environmental audits of most PEs to be sold. The financial advisors and technical consultants for
each of the selected PEs to be sold would identify, as part of their work plan, the PEs' environmental
performance relative to the required environmental standards of Argentina. These environmental
clauses would be incorporated into the sales memorandum requiring the new owners to follow a
program to address the environmental deficiencies. Furthermore, the Ministry of Defense has
decided to commit US$10 million from the counterpart of PERAL II for the environmental cleanup
of closed facilities (i.e., METEOR and HIPASAM).
F. Social Implications.
4.12        The gains of the program will accrue to taxpayers and consumers; the costs will be
mostly borne by fired workers. Most of the labor declared redundant within the productive PEs of
the Defense Complex is skilled and could be absorbed by the private sector. In spite of the large
number of labor redundancies associated with the public sector reform program, the unemployment
rate in the Metropolitan Area of Buenos Aires has decreased from 8.8 percent in May 1990 to the
6 percent range in 1991, and was 6.6 percent in May 1992, as economic activity recovered. A new
employment law (No. 24,013), passed in November 1991, was designed to assist the unemployed.
Nevertheless, where PEs are located in provinces with a low level of economic activity, or where the



- 21 -
PEs are the major employer, the social adjustment process could be severe. Severance payments are
part of the agreed program and would provide a transition period until workers find new jobs. A
study of the impact of the Reform Program of the Public Sector (including PEs) on the labor market-
-particularly in Patagonia and Jujuy, where relatively large PEs were closed with limited employment
options--is scheduled to start in March 1993 under funding from PEREL. Tle authorities hope this
study will provide them with data that can be used to ameliorate these specific problems and thus
dampen any negative social effect of the reform program.
G. Benefits and Risks.
4.13        The proposed loan would provide two major benefits for the economy:  (a)
improvements in public finances resulting from labor reductions and the elimination of past subsidies
to PEs; and (b) growth in industrial activity stemming from increased and more efficient private sector
output and investment under a competitive business environment To ensure the private sector takes
advantage of this expanded scope and that some fiscal savings are transferred to meet key social
sector needs, the authorities plan to keep defense outlays at the currently low share of GDP.
4.14        Potential gains from the Defense Ministry's reform program cannot be precisely
quantified. Many of the companies lack appropriate accounting procedures and past price cross-
subsidies were not transparent or properly recorded. The sale of these PEs could possibly generate
an average of only 20-30 percent of original book value, amounting to about US$1-1.5 billion. After
the settlement of PE liabilities, net cash realized would be small, especially if debt reduction is
included in the deals. Worker indemnities alone are expected to equal almost US$300 million. Major
benefits to the fiscal budget are expected to be realized by ending Defense PEs' losses, which
amounted to about US$480 million in 1991. Furthermore, additional savings would be realized by
the elimination of indirect subsidies to the private sector in the form of inputs (estimated at US$200
million for non-flat steel products and ethylene alone), increased tax revenues from the expanded
private sector, and reductions in debt payments.
4.15        However, there are three types of risks associated with the delivery of the program.
First, in the short term, there are the macroeconomic risks described in paras. 1.21-1.26. In addition,
there are political risks that could slow the pace of the reform program. Second senior management
changes have occasionally undermined the program. Further changes could jedpardize the timetable
or even the program itself Iibird due to the continued perception of a high level of country risk and
the poor operating status of some PEs, there might be limited interest by the international private
investors in some of these PEs. However, proceeding with the proposed program and PERAL II is
vital, as it offers the Government its first real opportunity to tackle groups of PEs that have been a
major cause for Argentina's industrial deficiencies in the past. The Government may find it difficult
to continue with the proposed reforms without timely Bank support; it would lack the implicit
certification of the transparency and objectivity of the reform process. The risk of proceeding at this
time is counterbalanced by the Government's continued courageous commitment to the reforms.

PART V. COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY AND OPERATIONS
A Main Objectves and IBRD Lending Program
5.01        Argentina joined the Bank in 1956, but was not a major borrower for many years. Of
the US$5A billion committed to date (net of cancellations), some 80 percent was committed between
FY81 and FY90, particularly in the latter half of the period. Bank involvement intensified beginning
in 1986, when the Government requested sectora} adjustment loans for reforms in agriculture, trade
and finance, and technical assistance loans (TALs) for rebuilding economic management capacity, in
addition to the ongoing investment loan program. Successive failed stabilization programs helped to
clarify the kinds of structural reforms needed, and through economic and sector work (ESW) and
other support through 1988, the Bank helped the Government articulate such a medium-term reform
agenda. During the hyperinflation crises, considerable resources were devoted to ESW, supervision,
and development of proposed operations, using these activities as vehicles for intensive policy
dialogue in lieu of new lending.
5.02        The Bank's main country assistance objective since 1989 has been to improve public
finances so as to eliminate the persistent structural deficit that has caused economic instability, slow
growth and increased poverty over the last decade. The emphasis is on public sector adjustment,
supplemented by investment and technical assistance loans, is based on extensive ESW in public
finances and a strong dialogue on macroeconomic policy. Major loans have supported reforms in
both the Federal Government and public enterprises (see paras. 1.04 and 1.05).
5.03        Portfolio Perfomance. The implementation of investment and technical assistance
loans approved prior to 1989, has suffered from macroeconomic instability, counterpart funding
constraints, and changes in policy orientation when the present government came to office. Also, the
Government's implementation capacity was limited because of poor management. As the economy
has stabilized, these difficulties hav  lessened. The Government has improved its savings
mobilization, relieving the constraintr en counterpart funding. Second, it has steadily improved its
investment programm hing trough preparation of an investment program tightly linked to the budget.
Third, though the civil service reform and associated salary increases, management in the public sector
has been gradually improved, though much remains to be done. Improved performance can be seen
in agricultural sector operations, in technical assistance for gas utilization, power engineering, public
enterprise, tax administration, the social sectors, as well as in the municipal and provincial
development projects.
B. Medium-Term Assistnce Objectives (FY93-97)
5.04        The Government should be able to consolidate fiscal stability within the next two years
and begin moving toward restoring public functions critical for the sustained growth of the private
sector and for social development. Effective Bank support therefore requires some shift in medium-
term assistance objectives and strategy. The Bank would continue to support the strengthening of
macroeconomic management and the completion of the reform program, focusing on fiscal stability,
modernization of the state and further market deregulation. At the same time, the emphasis would
increasingly be on three additional objectives: the improvement of savings mobilization and
intermediation; the restoration and development of public productive services and physical



-23 -
infrastructure; and the improvement of basic social services for the poor and natural resource
management. The latter two objectives would be carried out primarily throxugh operations at the
provincial leveL The entire lending program would remain contingent on satisfactory macroeconomic
performance during FY93-97, since any renewed fiscal disorder would make it difficult to realize
objectives of any loans.
5.05        Assuming strong macroeconomic and policy performance, Bank lending to Argentina
over the next five years would be on the order of about US$5.0 billion. Half of the FY93-94 program
would be devoted to adjustment lending, whereas investment and social sector operations would
account for all of the FY95-97 program.
5.06        Completion of the Reform Promgam. Adjustment Loans would focus on new and
complex areas, such as the divestiture of defense-related public enterprises, financial sector
adjustment, and provincial finance reform, as well as debt reduction. The Public Enterprise Reform
Adjustment Loan I, would extend the production program to all public enterprises within the defense
complex-a total of 45 enterprises in steel, petrochemicals, shipyards, and various industrial and
defense-related activities. The proposed Financial Sector Adjustment Loan would support, inter alia
reduction of public sector involvement in banking (through privatization, closures, and bank
restructuring), and the promotion of competitive and efficient financial intermediation (improved
credit eligibility, supervision, etc.). Finally, a proposed provincial adjustment loan would support fiscal
and structural reforms at the provincial level in tax collection, reductions in staffing, privatization of
provincial enterprises, and reduction of current expenditures.
5.07        Resource Mobilization and Intermediation.  Decades of high inflation have left
Argentina with a shrunken cap tal market and a banking sector geared to financing the public sector.
Bank lending for financial inte., nediation, discontinued because of high inflation, would resume with
a focus on banking sector reform, capital market development and improving access of small farmers
and newly privatized infrastructure suppliers. Proposed financial sector loans would support capital
market development and the restoration of lending with longer maturities. The program would
include cooperation with the IFC in the development of capital market institutions. Since the needs
for private investment financing are likely to be much greater, particularly until Argentina's access
to international capital markets is fully restored, the program may also include additional support for
credit lines and to improve farmers access to commercial banks. Newly-privatized infrastructure firms
may also need assistance, with guarantees of non-commercial risks, consistent with the ECO policy
paper, to enhance their access to intemational capital.
5.08        Public Productive Semces and Infrastructure. The deterioration of public services has
led to a loss of competitiveness by local producers. Two operations (for agricultural and industrial
services respectively) are planned to help restore the supply of research, quality control, vocational
training, and other services with information externalities. A group of six loans would help the
provinces cope with their extended responsibilities for infrastructure in the aftermath of public sector
reform. In the roads sector, where the establishment of competent planning agencies is important,
as is increased expenditure on road maintenance, a proposed road maintenance project is scheduled
for FY94.
5.09        Social Services and Environment. Education and Health services and social assistance
to vulnerable groups have siffered from the austerity measures of the 1980s and from the general
decline in the quality and efficiency of p blic sector management. The neglect of basic health



- 24 -
services and the lack of social assistance targeting have resulted in higher maternal and infant
mortality and in malnutrition, particularly in the poverty belts surrounding the cities of Buenos Aires
and Rosario and in the less developed northern provinces. The ongoing Social Sector TA loan has
helped the Government develop coherent strategies for education, health and social assistance, and
would provide the analytic base for the Bank's first forays into the social sector in Argentina.
Beginning in FY94, lending would help the provinces provide better health and nutrition assistance
to mothers and children, followed by support for secondary education.
5.10        As the economic crisis recedes, the Government is becoming more aware of the
adverse long-term environmental impact of existing patterns of natural resource use and industrial and
urban waste disposaL Soil erosion, water pollution and the degradation of forests and other
ecosystems are already constraining development and creating health hazards. Projects in the pipeline
include activities in soil conservation, forest and water management and urban waste. Future ESW
would focus on areas to support the Government in developing a legal framework that would allow
for effective regulation and market-based solutions.
5.11        Povertv Alleviation. The post-adjustment phase in Argentina, with more emphasis on
investment lending and the decentralization of most public services to the provinces, will place greater
demands on the implementation capacity of the government and on Bank resources. Experience
workdng with the provinces under ongoing projects suggests that many provinces do not have the
required capacity and need substantial institutional strengthening. This puts a premium on designing
projects with focussed objectives and activities, as opposed to complex nationwide programs involving
all the provinces. Even then, however, limited implementation capacity outside the main urban areas
will require greater supervision intensity on the part of the Bank.
5.12        Various of the activities described above would help to address important dimensions
of poverty in Argentina. Increased price stability would reduce the fluctuations of real wage and
pension income, against which poor households are unable to hedge. Private sector development
would expand employment opportunities in the formal sector and, in the medium term, increase real
wages. Several operations would specificaly contribute to poverty alleviation; a poverty study is
expected to increase the effectiveness of our assistance in this regard; the maternal and child health
project would target vulnerable groups in the urban poverty belts and the underdeveloped northern
provinces; the restoration of basic health services and improved access to secondary education would
improve living conditions for the poor, as would better environmental management, water supply, and
municipal services in the urban poverty belts.
5.13        Cooperation with Other Multilateral Institutions. The Bank has worked closely with
both the IMF and IDB in the design and execution of adjustment operations, in formulating the
lending strategy, and in economic and sector work. For example, since 1989, Bank and Fund staff
have exchanged information and views in the preparation of major public sector reform operations
being undertaken by the Bank. There has also been extensive consultation with the IDB, which has
co-financed a number of projects, including adjustment operations.
C IFC and MIGA Activities
5.14        IFCs investment strategy in Argentina is to support export-oriented investments and
privatization within the limits of its current exposure. IFC would seek mechanisms to mitigate the
country and payment risk (e.g. outside guarantees, external escrow accounts). Furthermore, under



v25 -
the present conditions, IFC would only finance those projects with strong export orientation. In
addition, IFC would support privatization or restructuring projects through fee-based advisory services
and foreign resource mobilization. To serve this objective, IFC is participating in the management
of a privatization fund and is considering the establishment of an underwriting fund to facilitate the
placement of equity and debt, as well as helping to setup brokerage houses, venture capital funds and
bond rating agencies. IFC has made 42 investments in Argentina, totaling US$746.4 million, of which
US$324.1 million has been repaid, canceled or sold. In FY92, there were investments in chemicals,
capital markets, energy, slaughtering, railroads, food and agribusiness, and malt production. MIGA
has also been very active in Argentina. Including projects in the pipeline, most of the countrys
allotment of $US150 million has already been committed to operations in banking and in pulp and
paper.
D. Recommendations
5.15        I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement
of the Bank and would be consistent with the approved guidelines for Bank support. The
recommendations for the inclusion and release of the debt set-aside amounting to US$100 million
in this proposed loan has been recommended in the President's report No. P-5914-AR dated
December 10, 1992 on Debt and Debt Service Reduction Loan.

SECOND PUBLIC ENTERPRISE REFORM ADJUSTMENT LOAN (PERAL Il .
LETTER OF DEVELOPMENT POLICY
Mr. Lewis T. Preston
President
World Bank
*        Washington, D.C.
Dear Mtr. Preston:
*-      tI.        Thist  Letter  of  Development  Policy  describes  the
overall  economic reform program of the Argentine Government as
well  as specific steps to deepen further the reforms in public
enterprises.       To  mneet  these  objectives.  the  Government
requests for cortinued technical and financial asistance from
the  World  Bank for its full implementation. We would like -to
take   this  opportunity  to  alto  present  the  ioacroeconomic
framework which compl enents the reform programn.
Mac rof onomic Fro
2.        Price  uttability   remains  the  centerpiece  of  the
Govern )ent's  economic  progra. in  achieving sustAined ;rowth
and  productivity.    Toward  this end, the Government' has made
Important. progress  in 1990 and 1991.  Monthly price increases:
dropped   from   over   30'   at   the  beginning  of  1991  to
approximately   international  rates  by  mid-1992.- Altthough
consumer  price inflation rose in the first quarter of 1992,. as
a  result  of  demand  pressures  associated :with'. the  strong
recovery  in 1991, the increase in the valuep-added tax (VAT) by
2  percentage  points, and seasonal factors,, thoe-Governmont has
designed  its  monetary  and fiscal po*icies with .the objective
of   reducing   Inflation   to  international  levels  for  t1ie
remainder  of  1992  and  into 1993.  The' Gove'rn'mnt intends t^
achieve  an operational primary surplus (bofore.asset-sales) of
US$3.0  billion  in  1992,  IJS$4.4  billion in 1993, and US$3.6
billion  in  1994.    These  amounts have-been calculated to be
sufficion'  to  service  projected  interest obligations once a;
debt   reductIon   arrangement  has nbeen. conc'luded  and  are
consistent  with  projected  available  finarcing.    If  these
levels   of  primary  surplus  prove  insufficient  to  obNsiate
inflationary financing the Governmwnt will undertake. fur,ther
fiscal  adJustments. Monetary  policy,, consistervt with the .Law
'of  Convertibility  pa%sed  in  April 1991, will be designed to
u*pand  the  noney  base r.onsistent with increased money demiand
result li,iQ  from  real  growth  and. internatlonal Inflation, and
the associated increase in net Internationa-l rwserves.

3.       Price  stability and sustained recovery of growth will
be achieved only if lasting structural reforms are undertaken
in the public sector. The Government's overall reform program
in achieving its objective of price stability is embodied in
two broad areas: (i) structural improveoents in the public
sector - improvements in fiscal management, revenues and
expenditures, further deepening of the privatization program
extending to public enterprises primarily under the tutelage
of the Ministry of Defense, improved efficiency in provincial
governments, and the reform of the social security system; and
{ii) policy reforms that would foster private sector activity
- continued commitment to maintenance of flexible and open
markets free of domestic regulations and major external trade
barriers, and with a strong financial sector to improve
intermediation.
Structural Improvqiments in the Public Sector
Federal Public Finances
4.  The   Government   has   given   increasing   attention  to
structural   improvements   in  public   sector  revenues  and
expenditures.
(a)  Federal  Revenues.    The  Government in December 1q89
implemented   a   major   tax   reform  that  improved
efficiency and provided additional revenues from the
VAT; the legislation would be maintained without
allowing  additional  exemptions.   The Government has
provided fiscal bonds for firms, including tho-e in
the steel secto-, that received special promocional
tax incentives and reduced benefits for firm'3 that
have    not   complied   with   original   contractual
obligations under the promotion regimes.
Capital revenues from the privatization of public
enterprises and concessions, which yielded Jb%$3.3
billion in cash and an additional US$7.2 billiin in
debt reductions in 1990-91, are expected to generate
about U5$1.9 billion in 1992, and will continue to be
used to reduce debt (external and internal) or for
labor indemnizations rather than spent on recurrent
costs; funds from defense privatizations will be used
for   extinguishing   liabilities  of  the  government
including labor indemnization.
(b)  Federal   Expenditures.    The  Government  has  given
increasing  attention  to  restructuring  the  Federal
Government.       The  program  includes,  among  other
things:  (i)  improvements  in  the  incentive  system



ANNEX X
Page 3 of 7
y vetwiy Q9ewiWeAs Gp4Oae
facing federal workers; (ii) reductions in federal
employment in the central administration and
decentralized agencies other than teachers and net of
increase in D6I staff of about 120,000 by end 1992,
comparing with the 1990 program base; and (iii)
establishment of a modern civil service payments
system.    To  improve  its  expenditure  controls and
budgetary processes, the Government has submitted to
Congress a modern law of Financial Management and
Performance Control that will provide comprehensive
budget limits for the entire nonfinancial public
sector, and an adequate internal control systems and
ex post external auditing. The Government intends to
implement   the   law   in   1992.    Futhermore,  the
Government is preparing a Law of Public Procurement
and Asset Management, which will eliminate many of
the   distortions   contained  in  the  Buy  Argentine
legislation.    At  the  same time, the Government has
introduced changes in cash management and accounting
systems,   placing   government  accounts  on  a  more
transparent basis.
For   1992/93,   the   Government   will  ensure  that
expenditures   are   consistent   with  its  projected
program,   or  less, should  projected  revenues  not
materialize, as provided for by Decree 1823/91. For
1993, the Government intends to propose a budget to
Congress    that    maintains   current   expenditures
consistent  with  those in its three year program, and
that continues its efforts to improve the quality of
expenditures.
Public Enterprise Reform
5.       The  public  enterprise  sector has long been a source
of deficits and economic inefficiency in Argentina. Since
1989, the public sector has been the object of far-reaching
reform which has taken the form of substantial reductions in
spending and in the fiscal deficit, as well as rapid and
effective   progress  in  privatizing  state  companies.    The
privatizations of large public enterprises initiated in 1991,
will be completed by 1993 for the Railway and Hydrocarbon
sectors.
6.       This  reform program is now extended to all the public
enterprises within the Defense Complex. In 1988, Argentina
allocated 3.1 percent of GDP to defense expenditures. The
GoverTr-mnt has embarked on an ambitious program to reduce and
n ffi maintain defense expenditures at 2 percent of GDP. To achieve
these   objectives  and  efficiency  levels,  the  Ministry  of
Defense  has  decided  to  privatize  virtually  all productive
enterprises uInder its auspices, and intends to avoid entering
into direct production under its tutelage in the future.

7.       These  are currently 45 enterprises within the Defense
Ministry in steels petrochemicals, shipyards, and various
industrial and defense-related activities of which 23 PEs are
the  focus  of  Bank  support.    The  steel sector is the most
important, accounting for more than 50 percent or more of the
employees, assets, and sales of the combined defense PCs.
Furthermore, the steel sector is the most complex in terms of
labor   unions  vested  private  sector  interests  and  policy
distortions.    Of the total number of PEs, 7 have been sold, 2
closed,   and   the   remainder   are  at  advanced  stages  of
privatization.    SIDINOX,  a "paper" created steel PE that was
not operational, will be legally closed. The remaining 12
enterprises   will   be   privatized   and/or  closed.    These
privatizations   have   helped   reduce   current   expenditure
transfers to the enterprises and lower the size of the debt as
some of the sales have involved debt conversion programs.
8.       The  administrative  reform  program has resulted in a
large number of lay-offs. In spite of these redundancies, the
unemployment rate in the Metropolitan area of Buenos Aires has
decreased from 8.9 percent in May 1990 to 5.4 percent in
October  1991,  as  economic  activity  increased.   To provide
cushion  for  the  social labor adjustment, the Government will
provide  workers  with severance payments as part of the agreed
program  and  would  provide  for  a  transition  period  until
workers  find  new  jobs.    However,  a large number of public
enterprises were considered of "strategic" importance and were
located in remote border areas of the country. The Government
will study the social impact of the public sector reform
program on the labor force, with special emphasis in the
remote areas where some of the key defense industries are
located.
9.       A  number  of  PEs within the Defense Complex have had
adverse environmental effects. The Government has appointed a
new Secretariat for the Environment responsible for drafting
new legislation and enforcing better environmental standards.
This Secretariat has undertaken a number of environmental
audits of selected. PEs (i.e., those most environmentally
unsafe  and  closed).    The sales memorandum of selected large
enterprises has included environmental audit results in making
new   private  owners  follow  an  agreed  program  to  address
environmental  deficiencies.   In addition to the privatization
effort within the Ministry of Defense, the Government intends
ff   to  undertake reform programs in the military complex including
the sale of real estate belonging to the armed forces.
10.      In  addition,  three other areas of the reform program
f / for 1992-93 include measures to increase efficiencies In
provincial   finances,  the  social  security  system  and  the



ANNEX X

y  o-ei eV9e-wwiod 9h'cs
financial sector which are being addressed separately under
Bank assistance.
Provincial Finance
11.      Many  provincial governments are undertaking their own
fiscal and structural reform programs in tax collection,
reductions in staffing levels, privatization of provincial
enterpises, and reduction of current expenditures. To support
these   measures,   the   Government  has  provided  additional
resources as envisaged in existing anp new taxes, maintained
restrictions  on  credit  to provincial banks, required private
lenders  to provincial to governments provision their new loans
at 100%, and restricted exceptional transfers to provincial
governments.
Social Security
12.      The   Government  intends  to  submit  legislation  to
Congress that would transform the pay-as-you-go system into a
partially capitalized system cum minimum pension. The new
system is anticipated to be in place in 1993. In the short
run, the Government will improve collection and management of
the present system, with the objective of raising new revenues
and reducing evasion.
II. Policy Reforms for Promoting Private Sector Activity
Maintenance of an Open and Flexible Economy
13.      For  the  past  several  years, especially since 1989,
Argentina has been engaged in a major overhaul of its economy
in order to eliminate tne institutional obstacles that have
constrained the flexibility and responsiveness of the private
sector.    Trade  liberalization,  public  enterprise  and open
market reforms constitute the new direction of the economic
program.
(a)  Trade  Liberalization:  The  Government has made rapid
strides towards opening the economy, both in terms of
flows of trade, capital, and technology. The import
tariff structure was simplified and lowered; import
tariffs are now 22 percent on finished goods, 13
percent on production inputs, 5 percent on primary
products,   and   have  been  eliminated  for  capital
goods.    Export  taxes  have  also  been  eliminated,
non-tariff  barriers  to imports and exports have been
reduced,    and   virtually   all   restrictions   and
discretionary  procedures  that  slowed  the  entry of
v' <trade,    capital    and    technology   have   nearly
\~~~~~~~~~~I

disappeared.    The  Government  intends  to maintain,
with no reversal, its open policy of its economy to
international   competition,   including   steel   and
petrochemical product groups, and the antidumping
provisions   will   be   consistent   with   the  GATT
Anti-Dumping  Code.   Moreover, the MERCOSUR treaty is
now being implemented. Two regional tariff cuts have
already taken place, and it is the Government's
intention, as specified in the Treaty of Asuncion, to
reduce all intra-MERCOSUR tariffs to zero by January
1995, while eliminating all other intra-market trade
barriers.
(b)  Open  market  economy:  The  Government has eliminated
substantial controls on prices, wages, and interest
rates as well as a complex network of subsidies and
implicit  taxes.    Much  still  remains to be done on
state  reforms  and  opening  of  the  markets.    The
Government's reform program is not only to reduce the
size  of  the  public  sector,  but  also to avoid the
transfer   of   public   to  private  monopolies  when
attracting new capital, management and technology.
To   complement   other   pro-competitive  initiatives
already         undertaken-trade         liberalization,
privatizations, deregulation- the Government intends
to improve the existing competition Law to avoid
undue ownership concentration and be more proactive
to ensure a dynamic and competitive private sector.
Financial Sector
14.      To   accelerate  private  sector  investment,  improve
financial sector performance, and encourage efficiency in the
allocation process, the Government intends to undertake major
reforms in the financial sector. Within the financial sector,
the Government intends to reduce the size of public sector
involvement in banking (through privatizations, closures, and
bank   restructuring),   and   will   promote  competitive  and
efficient    financial    intermediation    (improved    credit
eligibility, supervision, etc.). The downsizing of the public
banking sector will greatly itself contribute to macroeconomic
and price stability.
World Bank &5MlZrt
lS.      The  above  presentation  demostrates the depth of the
Government's   overall  public  sector  reform  program.    The
Government  believes  that  financial  asistance from the World
Bank is essential to implement its public enterprise reforms,
especially for PEs within the Defense Complex. In particular,

it is the intention of the Government to use the counterpart
funds generated from the loan as one of the sources to finance
the  Government's  staff  reduction  program,  as well as funds
from   other   technical  assistance  sources  to  finance  the
drafting of new legislation and other technical assistance
needs required for the success of the program. The Government
will also use US*10 million of the proposed loan for the
environmental   cleanup   of   the   Defense  Complex's  closed
facilities.       Finally  the  loan  will  clearly  assist  the
Government in regularizing its external debt obligations under
ft/   the recently signed agreement with its commercial creditors.
