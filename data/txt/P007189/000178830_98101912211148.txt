CHIXOY POWER PROJECT
CHAPTER 1
THE SECTOR
Energy Consumption and Resources
1.01      Gross energy consumption in Guatemala, although accelerating sub-
stantially in recent years (from an average growth rate of 3.9% p.a. in the
1960's to 4.7% p.a. in 1970-75 is still at a low level by Central American
standards.  It amounted to 2,080 M.T.o.e. 1/ (0.34 T.o.e. per capita) in 1975,
which is about one-quarter of the highest national consumption level in the
area (1.22 T.o.e. per capita in Panama) and well below the regional average
(0.49 T.o.e. per capita). This reflects the fact that about 40% of the
population has yet to be integrated into the modern sector of the economy.
While commercial energy (petroleum derivatives and hydroelectricity) has been
growing in importance, a high proportion of total consumption (46% in 1975)
was derived from traditional energy sources (wood and bagasse). Total gross
consumption of electric energy generated by public utilities and self producers
is estimated at 1,140 GWh (about 188 kWh per capita) in 1975.
1.02      Thus far Guatemala has had to import all of its petroleum fuels.
However, spurred on by major oil discoveries in southern Mexico and the en-
ergy crisis, exploration for oil and gas by private oil companies was inten-
sified and commercial finds have been recently reported. Unfortunately, the
oil discovered so far is apparently high in sulfur and paraffin content,
making it unsuitable (without special processing) for use in the existing
refinery in Guatemala. On the other hand, Guatemala has a large, technically
exploitable hydroelectric potential which has recently been calculated at
4,300 MW. This contrasts sharply with 121 MW (2.5% of the potential) in
installed hydroelectric capacity. Moreover, being a country with geological
characteristics similar to El Salvador's and Nicaragua's -- where geothermal
potential is being either successfully defined or exploited -- Guatemala may
also have an exploitable geothermal potential. A comprehensive exploration
program recently completed in the Moyuta geothermal field disclosed that it
could not be economically exploitable for power generation. Nevertheless, the
exploration program continues in other potential fields (Zunil and Amatitlan).
1.03      Consumption of electric energy generated by public utilities
increased from 370 GWh in 1966 to 906 GWh in 1976, representing an average
growth rate of 9.4% p.a. The main factor contributing to this growth rate has
been the substantial development of the industrial sector which in 1976
accounted for 47% of the total power consumption, while residential consump-
tion amounted to 26%. The remainder, 27%, was absorbed by the commercial and
government sectors. The relative market share of the industrial sector is
expected to continue to grow during the project period, as shown below for
sales in the central interconnected system, which represents 85% of the total
market:

Power Sector
1.04      The power sector consists of Instituto Nacional de Electrificacion
(INDE), Empresa Electrica de Guatemala (EEG), and numerous (though consider-
ably smaller) private and municipal utilities and self-producers. Some of the
smaller utilities have their own generating capacity and are not intercon-
nected with INDE or EEG systems; the remainder purchase bulk energy from
INDE or EEG. EEG, established in 1922 by foreign investors to serve the
country's most lucrative market (Guatemala City and its environs) is currently
controlled by the Government. INDE was created in 1959 by the Government to
serve the rest of the country and to assume responsibility for expansion of
power generation.
1.05      The relative shares in total public service generation and sales
to consumers in 1976 were as follows:
Retail
Generation             Sales
INDE                   68%                   10%
EEG                    30%                   76%
Others                  2%                   14%
Present total generating capacity amounts to 492 MW. Of this, 314 MW (64%)
are in the interconnected system located in the southern half of the country;
16 MW (3.3%) correspond to isolated INDE, privately and municipally-owned
utilities; and 161 MW (32.7%) belong to miscellaneous self-producers.
Prior Bank Involvement in the Sector
1.06      In 1960-62 the Bank served as Executing Agency for a UN Special
Fund (UNDP) project consisting of the preparation of a hydroelectric resource
survey and master plan for the power sector. Subsequently, the Bank made
three loans for the power sector in Guatemala, all to INDE, Loan 487-GU of
US$15 million equivalent, signed in March 1967, assisted in financing the 60
MW Jurun-Marinala hydroelectric project and associated facilities, transmission



lines, installation of a 12.7 MW gas turbine, and some diesel units.  The
project was completed close to the original schedule; actual construction
costs were 12 percent higher than the estimates prepared at the time the
project was appraised. The investment in Jurun-Marinala compared with an
equivalent thermal plant was found, according to the appraisal report, to be
the most economic alternative at discount rates of 10 percent or less; however,
due mainly to the subsequent large increases in fuel prices, it will be the
most economic alternative even at discount rates higher than 10 percent.
1.07      T'he second loan, 545-GU of US$7 million equivalent, signed in June
1968, financed the foreign exchange component of a 33 MW steam unit, and site
investigations, pre-investment studies and design of the first stage of the
Atitlan hydroelectric project. The original site for the steam unit was
ruined by a flood in September 1969, after works had already started. The
flood revealed that the proposed site lay in an ancient river bed, and works
had to be restarted at a new site, involving substantially greater civil works.
This incident was the main factor causing a 22-month delay in completion of
the unit and a 60 percent cost overrun. Given the delays in preparing hydro-
electric projects that had occurred, the 33 MW steam unit was probably the
best system addition that could be made at the time. INDE did not achieve
the financial rates of return contained in the tariff covenants under the two
loans. The poor financial performance has its roots in INDE's weak position
vis-a-vis EEG. The Bank appraised a power project in 1972, which did not go
forward as a result of a disagreement between the Bank and the Government over
a proposed bid award for two thermal generating units, the main components of
the project. However, discussions during the preparation of said project led
to the development of a new master plan with technical assistance from the
Federal Republic of Germany. The priority of the Chixoy project was estab-
lished in this plan.
1.08      A project performance audit report prepared by the Operations
Evaluation Department on the First and Second Power Projects was distributed
to the Executive Directors on February 14, 1975. The main conclusions of
this report were that, although the Bank had played a large part in the expan-
sion of Guatemala's power supply and in helping to establish INDE as the
major institution in the power sector, it could have contributed more to the
solution of the two most serious problems in the sector--the poor financial
performance arising mainly from the unsatisfactory arrangements between INDE
and EEG, and the lack of development of Guatemala's hydroelectric resources.
Subsequently, a review of the power sector was carried out in August 1975.
The conclusions of this review and of the performance audit guided the prepara-
tion of the third Bank loan to INDE.
1.09      Loan 1426-GU (signed in June 1977) provided US$55 million equiv-
alent to finance the foreign exchange component of the 90 MW Aguacapa hydro-
electric plant and a part of the management consulting services required for
INDE's institutional improvement program. All contracts for the Aguacapa
project have been awarded and construction of project works is generally
on schedule; while delays have been experienced in carrying out the studies
included in the project (see paras. 1.21, 2.03, and 5.06), some management
consultants have already been hired and the remainder are expected to be hired

soon. The assurances obtained under said loan are intended to substantially
improve the efficiency of the Guatemalan power sector. Effectiveness of the
loan was delayed by five months as a result of delays in implementing an
adequate tariff increase and executing an agreement between the Government,
EEG, and INDE on bulk tariffs and sector coordination (see paras. 1.17 and
5.06).
1010      The proposed loan, which would be the fourth operation of the Bank
Group with the sector, is also designed to assist INDE in developing its
hydroelectric resources by financing the 300 MW Chixoy project, the largest
item in Guatemala's 1977-82 power sector investment program. The project was
prepared by INDE and its consultants; appraised in March 1977 by a Bank
mission composed by Messrs. C.F. Mena, J. Parker, and C. Warren and updated
through supplemental missions by Mr. Mena in May and November 1977.
Sector Review
1.11      A Bank mission visited Guatemala in August 1975 to review the power
sector. The mission's findings were discussed with the Guatemalan authorities
in March and July 1976. They are summarized in the following paragraphs,
which also report the current status of the Government's actions to increase
the power sector's efficiency.
System Expansion and Planning
1.12      After the 1960-62 master plan exercise, there was no sound follow-up
or long-term planning for the expansion of the system. INDE, which is respon-
sible for generation expansion, failed to discharge this function effectively,
particularly in project preparation. The development of the country's abun-
dant hydroelectric resources fell behind the pace recommended in the master
plan. Only 40% of additions in generating capacity since 1962 have been
hydroelectric, compared with a recommended 95% in the 1960-1962 master plan.
The high thermal component rendered power sector finances vulnerable to the
worldwide increase of fuel prices which began in 1973.
1.13      The Government which took office in 1974 adopted as a major policy
objective the development of the country's hydroelectric potential and the
overall strengthening of the energy sector.  The Government's new emphasis
coincided with the completion of the first phase of a new master plan for the
development of the electric system which was financed by a technical assistance
grant from the Federal Republic of Germany. A Master Plan Group was formed
which issued its report 1/ in May 1976. The report identifies 121 exploitable
hydroelectric projects with an estimated aggregate firm capacity of about
4,300 MW. After a detailed investigation of these projects, 20 hydro and 8
thermal projects have been selected to meet the anticipated load growth
through the year 2000.

-5-
1.14      This work enabled the Government for the first time to base its
power investment program on a comprehensive long-range plan. The medium-term
program which had been developed from individual project studies was confirmed
by the master plan-and includes the 90 MW Aguacapa hydroelectric project for
operation in 1979 and the 300 MW Chixoy hydroelectric project for 1982. To
fill capacity requirements before Aguacapa comes on stream, the program
includes two individual 25 MW gas turbine units (in operation since February
1977) and one 53 MW steam plant (operating since April 1977). The program
also called for development of a first (30 MW) geothermal plant at Moyuta by
1981, but since this field has not proved economically exploitable for power
generation, the Government has pursued an alternative solution (para 4.01)
which would add a net 34 MW of combined cycle plant to generating capability.
Organization and Management
1.15      The sector has been marked by conflict between INDE and EEG, both in
operating style and outlook. EEG has been relatively well managed. However,
despite the acquisition of 93% ownership by Government in 1972, it continues
to view its functions rather narrowly. INDE had been less well managed,
financially weak and, in particular, had not until recently discharged its
responsibility for expanding power generation in an effective manner.
1.16      With the objective of strengthening the sector, Government cre-
ated a special commission on sector reorganization in January 1976 to study
alternatives for the future organization of the sector and to develop rec-
ommendations for action by the Cabinet-level National Economic Commission.
The special commission's terms of reference also required it to propose broad
policies in the areas of tariffs and the strengthening of INDE. The commission
submitted a report to the National Economic Commission in late September 1976.
With regard to sector reorganization the report recommends principally that
only one entity be responsible for public electricity service, and that INDE
absorb EEG's operations as well as those of all other private and municipal
electric utilities. In May 1977, prior to reacting to this recommendation and
upon the expiration of EEG's concession, the Government declared the company a
non-profit, mixed-ownership public utility reporting to the Minister of
Economy.
1.17      In connection with Loan 1426-GU, the Government stated its intention
to reorganize the sector to develop an improved institutional structure cover-
ing generation, transmission and distribution. Although the Government planned
to communicate its decision on this matter to the Bank by June 30, 1977, its
decision was delayed because of the complex issues involved. The most sensitive
of these are the need to reconcile the relatively favorable conditions enjoyed
by EEG's unionized employees with INDE's much lower pay scales, and the
treatment of EEG's minority shareholders. The discussion on sector organization
was also complicated by the upcoming elections. In view of these factors the
Government rejected any appearance of Bank review of its decisions on sector
reorganization. However, the agreements for Loan 1426-GU contain adequate
assurances that sector coordination and finances will be improved. These
assurances, which have been reconfirmed under the proposed loan, are
summarized below:



- 6 -
(a) The Government agreed to take all actions necessary to ensure
the economic operation of all generating and transmission
facilities in the interconnected system. Expansion of these
facilities would be based on economically justified programs.
(b) The Government agreed to an improved tariff covenant, which
specifies targets for consolidated sector revenues (including
those of EEG).
(c) The Government and INDE have entered into a subsidiary
agreement with EEG, providing for:
(i) compliance with (a) and (b) above by EEG;
(ii) transfer by EEG to INDE of any funds in excess of
its own requirements; and
(iii) participation of EEG in a tariff structure study,
an asset revaluation study and provision of other
information required by INDE.
(d) INDE agreed not to create or acquire any company if such
action would adversely affect its financial condition or the
efficiency of its management and personnel; and that any
change in INDE's charter, which would materially or adversely
affect INDE or the passage of a resolution for the dissolution
of INDE, without the agreement of the Bank, would be an
event of default. These provisions ensure that there will
be adequate consultation between Government and the Bank
prior to the implementation of any major decision on
organization which might affect INDE.
1.18      A Guatemalan delegation informed the Bank in September 1977, that
Government had decided not to act on the recommendation of the special
commission on sector reorganization for the present. Instead, it wished to
preserve INDE and EEG as separate entities, while moving toward an improved
allocation of responsibilities between them. The principal measure now
proposed would be the transfer of all EEG's generating plants to INDE. The
Government appointed a new study committee to assess the merits of the estab-
lishment of a commission to regulate the sector, and prepare the transfer of
the plants. The work program calls for two parallel activities: transfer of
EEG's generating plants to INDE, 1/ by December 31, 1979, and study of sector
regulation, scheduled to be completed by March 31, 1978 (if this study were to
recommend the creation of a regulatory body, initiation of its functions
is scheduled for December 31, 1979). The tasks and schedule of activities of
the committee have been found satisfactory by the Bank. The Government agreed
to carry out the power sector reorganization and use its best efforts to
complete it by December 31, 1979. Government was not able to assume an
absolute obligation to complete the reorganization by the indicated date
because Congressional approval is required for completion.
1/   The possibility of transfering some of INDE's distribution facilities
to EEG would also be assessed.

Tariffs and Finances
1.19      EEG's concession agreement gave it the power to set tariffs within
ample limits and INDE's charter gives it full discretion in this area. In
practice, however, tariff increases have been subject to Government approval.
Tariffs of the two utilities have been developed independently, without
adopting a common focus. EEG's tariffs were reviewed and updated in 1975 and
1978 with the help of consultants, but this was done from the perspective of
EEG as a distribution utility, planning only a few years ahead and not con-
cerned with overall sector policies. INDE's retail tariff structure has not
been changed since 1967.
1.20      In the past, tariffs have not been set at levels sufficient to
provide an adequate contribution to sector expansion. Increases in consumer
charges in the last two years have not been sufficient to offset increasing
operating costs. Consequently, the financial position of the sector has
been weak. This situation can only be improved by increasing sector reve-
nues. However, because of the bulky nature of the investment program ahead,
and since average consumer charges are already relatively high (US 46.57/Wh),
it would not be reasonable to raise the substantial funds required solely
through tariffs; a blend of tariff increases, borrowings and government
contributions would be more appropriate.
1.21      Under Loan 1426-GU Government and INDE agreed to carry out a compre-
hensive tariff structure study by January 30, 1978. The conclusions of this
study and proposals for implementation would be discussed with the Bank.
Because of the need to concentrate on the short-term tariff study carried
out in the context of effectiveness of the Aguacapa loan, INDE decided to
defer the initiation of the comprehensive tariff structure study. However,
INDE has now submitted to the Bank generally satisfactory terms of reference
for the comprehensive tariff study and is expected to invite consultants
to present proposals within the next 60 days. The report of the consultants
would be furnished to the Bank by July 31, 1979.
Service Extensions
1.22      Sales of electricity to final consumers totalled 1038 GWh, or about
160 kWh per capita in 1977. In addition to being low by Central American
standards, this per capita consumption masks an extremely uneven regional
distribution of the electricity load. Consumption per capita in Guatemala
City and environs amounted to 456 kWh, which is about 14 times the consumption
per capita of 33 kWh in the rest of the country. Of about 6.5 million
inhabitants in 1976 only about 20% received electrical service. This figure
is among the lowest in Latin America. The Government is aware that electricity
must be made available to a greater proportion of the population and, through
INDE, it has initiated a series of rural electrification programs to meet this
objective.
1.23      To reduce the heavy imbalance in access to electricity between the
EEG concession area and the rest of the country, INDE early in 1976 began
preparing for the first time a national rural electrification program. Some
limited efforts in this area had been initiated in recent years. In 1971,



the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) with a US$7.0
million loan, financed transmission lines and related substations through the
Western Highlands (San Marcos, Huehuetenango and Quiche) and the Northern
Lowlands (Baja Verapaz and Alta Verapaz). These transmission lines were
connected to distribution systems to serve 61 towns and villages, thereby
providing reliable, full-time power to these areas. The transmission network
now in place is adequate to serve a large number of other villages as well.
INDE has recently built some substations and distribution networks in the
eastern part of the country, laying the foundation for further expansion in
this area. The new program, preparation of which has now been completed, is
designed to expand the rural electrification effort substantially, both in
size and in geographical coverage. INDE expects to obtain financing from
USAID and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) for this program. Since
the construction and operation of rural distribution systems are relatively
simple and do not require a large number of skilled workers, INDE will have
the capacity to expand services to the rural population while construction of
large hydro projects is being carried out. The 69 kV subtransmission works
to be financed by the proposed loan would complement the rural electrification
programs by providing facilities needed to link INDE's existing system with
new markets and by strengthening existing lines to support increased transfers
and increase service reliability.
Future Expansion
1.24      The sector expansion program is described in Chapter 4 and the major
installations involved appear on the map. Discussions have been proceeding
for the past two years between representatives of INDE and the Comision
Ejecutiva Hidroelectrica del Rio Lempa (GEL) of El Salvador concerning a
transmission line to tie their electric systems by year-end 1980. Consultants
for a feasibility study (Courtoy Traction of Belgium) completed a preliminary
report on the line in September 1977, with financing from the Central American
Bank for Economic Integration (CABEI). The report shows that the proposed
transmission line could prove to be of benefit to both countries. If an
agreement is reached between El Salvador and Guatemala, the line could be in
operation by year-end 1980. Initially, reserve capacity would be provided by
El Salvador to Guatemala, because El Salvador would have available spare
capacity to sell outside its market. After 1982, when the Chixoy project is
expected to be in operation, the reverse could take place. Both INDE's and
CEL's finances should benefit significantly from the proposed interconnection.
The Bank would continue to follow the progress of the study in the course of
its supervision of the project and of CEL's Ahuachapan Expansion Project
(Loans 1288-TES and 1289-ES). CABEI is expected to finance the line.
1.25      In addition to the study mentioned above, the United Nations Eco-
nomic Commission for Latin America is conducting a study on the long-range
possibilities for interconnection among the Central American countries.
INDE and CEL are cooperating in this study; its first stage was recently
completed and indicated that an integrated electric system operation would
be beneficial. A second stage of the study is currently underway, with
financial support from CABEI, IDB and UNDP, which will examine further the
potential benefits of an integrated system operation and will attempt to
provide a basis for regional sector planning.

CHAPTER 2
THE BORROWER
2.01      The borrower would be INDE, a Government-owned autonomous institu-
tion responsible for bulk electricity supply and retail distribution outside
the area (Guatemala City) supplied by EEG. INDE's Board of Directors is
composed of five directors and three alternates, all appointed by the President
of Guatemala. Management is entrusted to a General Manager and four Deputy
Managers. INDE is exempted from taxes and import duties.
Organization and Management
2.02      INDE's organization, which had not changed significantly since the
second project was appraised in 1968, is being strengthened. To achieve this
objective, INDE's management is currently carrying out a program agreed with
the Bank under Loan 1426-GU. The areas covered by this program are the
improvement of personnel management, planning, financial management and office
facilities and procedures. INDE's recently adopted new organization arrange-
ment appears in Figure 2.1 (Organization Chart).
2.03      Under the program mentioned above, INDE has hired an advisor to
prepare terms of reference for a personnel upgrading program, introduced
improved office procedures and presented for Bank review terms of reference
for asset revaluation. These terms of reference were found generally satis-
factory by the Bank and the studies are expected to be initiated soon. During
the next two years INDE has agreed to reorganize its planning and financial
groups into departments and implement new personnel and salary policies.
Preparation of the comprehensive personnel improvement program has fallen
behind the schedule agreed under Loan 1426-GU, because the personnel advisor
was diverted to more urgent matters. These included advising on important
day-to-day management problems, such as recent labor unrest, review of salary
increases, terminations undertaken to improve efficiency and recruitment of
needed construction supervisory staff. The personnel advisor has now prepared
terms of reference for management consultants to implement the personnel
upgrading program. These consultants are expected to be hired in the fourth
quarter of 1978, and new target dates (postponed about a year) have therefore
been agreed to complete the various steps of the program. The new personnel
management system is expected to be operational by December 31, 1980. The
Bank obtained assurances from Government under Loan 1426-GU that INDE's
management consultants will base their study on INDE's need to provide compen-
sation that would be competitive with other potential employers and that the
appropriate Government agencies 1/ would review the consultant's study with
the Bank and to discuss with the Bank the proposals for implementing the
consultant's recommendations.
1/   e.g. INDE, the Civil Service Commission, the Planning Commission, and
the Ministry of Finance.



- 10 -
2.04      Loan 1426-GU includes US$250,000 to assist INDE in carrying out
the asset revaluation, accounting and personnel po-;tions of the improvement
program. A further US$200,000 would be provided by the proposed loan for
the tariff study (para. 1.21).
Accounts and Audit
2.05      While the quality of INDE's accounts is generally adequate, their
timeliness needs to be improved. INDE recently acquired an electronic computer
to speed data processing and analysis and is expected to hire soon consulting
services to train INDE's personnel in modernization of the utility's billing
and accounting procedures as well as in the efficient operation of the new
computer. INDE's financial statements are audited by a local auditing firm
(Lizarralde y Ayestas Asociados) whose work has been satisfactory. INDE should
agree to continue appointing independent auditors satisfactory to the Bank and
to send to the Bank the audited financial statements together with the auditor's
report within four months from the end of each fiscal year.

CHAPTER 3
THE MARKET
Load Forecast
3.01      Acting on the recommendation of the Bank's August 1975 power sector
mission, a working group composed of INDE and EEG personnel, prepared early in
1976 a demand and generation forecast for the 1976-89 period. This forecast
was evolved by trend analysis of electricity consumption in the country during
the preceding 25 years. It assumes an average growth rate in electricity con-
sumption of 11.1% p.a. for the country as a whole and a 9.2% p.a. growth rate
for consumption in the central area. 1/ These figures are high in view of
past growth rates (1972-1977) which have averaged 9.2% p.a. and 7.9% p.a. for
the whole country and for the central region respectively. This appraisal
assumes growth rates closer to the historical ones. While the central region,
which includes Guatemala City, is a fairly well developed market, other areas
have low penetration and low levels of consumption. As a result of continuing
incorporation of isolated distribution systems into the national interconnected
system and INDE's rural electrification programs, energy demand has been
increasing rapidly outside the central region. Thus, while in 1972-1977
central region sales grew by 7.9%, combined sales in all other regions grew by
20%. For this appraisal this latter rate of growth is assumed to decrease
with time as electrification of towns and rural areas progresses, and in 1987
it is projected at 8.7% as compared to a projected central region growth of
8.1%. For the period 1978-1983 the assumed average sales growth rates are
8.4% for the central region, 18% for the rest of the country, and 9.7% for the
whole country. 2/ The resultant generation and power forecasts for 1978-1983
are shown in Table 3.1.
3.02      Not included in the aforementioned growth rate forecasts are the
electricity requirements of the nickel mining company, Exmibal, located in the
Atlantic coast department of Izabal.  This mine has a power plant, consisting
of a steam unit (60 MW) and stand-by diesels (10 MW), which use imported fuel.
Mining operations have been initiated and the power plant is expected to be
generating about 390 GWh per year by 1982 with an annual production of 14,000
tons of 75% nickel matte. Cheaper electric generation may play an important
role in the decision on further expansion of Exmibal's processing facilities.
Although INDE's system would not have the capability to supply Exmibal until
the Chixoy project comes on stream (1982), connection of the Exmibal load to
INDE's system should be studied soon. A component of the proposed loan would
finance foreign costs of individual transmission line consultants to advise
INDE's staff on the preparation of the required study. Since the Exmibal load
1/   The central region consists of the departments of Guatemala, Sacatepequez,
Escuintla, and Chimaltenango; in 1976 it accounted for 87% of total
electricity consumption.
2/   Sales growth in 1978 is expected to be below the trend in the last five
years due to the probable attenuating effect of the tariff increase
applied in May 1978.

represents a large increment in sector demand figures, it has been treated
separately in the forecast shown in Table 3.1.
Energy and Capacity Balance
3.03      The central interconnected system, which serves about 87% of public
service requirements in the country, operated without adequate reserves in the
period 1975-1977. INDE had programmed commercial operation of two new 25 MW
gas turbine generating units for June 1976 and one 53 MW steam plant for
December 1976. The earthquake of February 1976 delayed final procurement
arrangements for the gas units as well as delivery to the site of major
components of the steam plant which had to be transported through El Salvador
because the road from the Guatemalan port (Puerto Barrios) to the site had
been severely damaged. Initial testing of the gas units took place in February
1977 but their reliable operation has only recently been obtained, mainly
because substantial redesign of principal components has been required. At the
same time the Jurun Marinala hydro plant's firm capacity was reduced by 30% due
to storage depletion, brought about by a severe dry season and heavy operation
to offset inadequate thermal capability. These problems left the system
without reserves in generating capacity and long service outages occurred
between February and May of 1977, when the new 53 MW steam generating unit
went on stream. The situation has since improved and the margin of reserve
capacity over peak demand is currently about 44%. The sector energy and
capacity balance is shown in Table 3.2.

CHAPTER 4
PROGRAM AND PROJECT
The Program
4.01      The sector expansion program is substantially the same one analyzed
in conjunction with Loan 1426-GU. However, the proposed Moyuta geothermal
plant has been deleted because it did not prove economic and two gas turbines for
combined cycle operation at EEG's existing La Laguna plant have been added.
The La Laguna extension was originally proposed by EEG to improve system
reliability, which appeared poor during the temporary outages described in
Chapter 3, and reduce expensive operation of INDE's gas units. In the course
of its consultation with the Bank on the proposal, the Government has been
able to demonstrate its economic merit. The two 20 MW gas turbine units are
proposed to operate in combined cycle with two existing 13 MW steam units,
with a resulting total capacity of 60 MW. Through the utilization of a fuel
purifier the plant would burn locally produced crude oil instead of the much
more expensive diesel fuel. The proposed units could be in full operation by
year-end 1978 and could produce annual savings averaging about US$3 million at
present prices (15% of total fuel expenditures) until Chixoy begins commercial
operation. The Bank concurred in the investment after the Government agreed
that EEG's existing generating plants, which are inefficient, should be
retired, and on the understanding that the proposed new plant would be
transferred in property and operation to INDE by year-end 1979 (when sector
reorganization is expected to be completed), in order for INDE to maintain its
role of bulk supplier.
4.02      The sector's expansion program during the period 1977=1982 consists
of the following works (see Figure 4.2 - Map IBRD 12449R):

The Project
4.04      The project comprises the major component in INDE's construction
program, its Chixoy project (see Figures 4.2 and 4.3 - maps), as well as
subtransmission expansion and studies. IDB,Fondo de Inversiones de Venezuela
(FIV) and CABEI have already provided substantial financing for Chixoy;
preliminary works of the Chixoy project were initiated early in 1976 and the
major civil contract (for the tunnel) was awarded in May 1977 to Hochtief A.G.
(Germany). This contract is being financed by IDB and FIV.
Project Objectives
4.05      In order to maintain adequate service reliability of the inter-
connected system, additional capacity will need to be operational by 1982.
The Chixoy plant will provide the additional capacity required by utilizing
Guatemala's hydroelectric resources. The commissioning of Chixoy will make
possible a substantial reduction in thermal generation, thus reducing the
country's dependence on imported fuel. The 69 kV subtransmission facilities
would complement the rural electrification programs by providing the means to
link INDE's existing system with new markets and by strengthening existing
lines to support increased transfers and increase service reliability. The
proposed loan will allow the Bank to participate in the financing of this
needed project and, equally important, to continue assisting Government in the
implementation of sector reforms and the institutional strengthening of INDE.
4.06      A reliable supply of electric power is essential to Guatemala's
economic growth and the improvement of the standard of living of its popula-
tion. Industry is the largest consumer of electricity in the country (para.
1.03). While the future needs of the largest industrial enterprises could be
met with captive generation rather than through INDE's system, medium and
small-scale industries would in many cases find this alternative excessively
costly. In addition, this approach would be wasteful of the country's resour-
ces, since it would result in duplication of investment and retain reliance
on costly fuel. The project, therefore, is expected to facilitate the devel-
opment of medium and small-scale industrial activity in the country.
Project Features
4.07      The Chixoy plant site is located in the department of Alta Verapaz,
in the country's central region and about 100 km north of Guatemala City
see Figure 4.2 - map IBRD 12449R). The climate of the area is temperate
(15°-230C temperature) and humid (1,000 mm average annual rainfall) and the
sparse population, dependent on subsistence agriculture and living in the
nearby mountains, plant vegetables, beans, and corn. This zone is located in
the northern mountain group, composed of metamorphic and igneous intrusive
rocks and a thick layer of sedimentary rocks, where the Chixoy river flows.
This river is the main tributary of the Usumacinta, the largest river in the
country which also serves for part of its length as the boundary between
Guatemala and Mexico. However, as the Chixoy project would not divert any
water from the Usumacinta or adversely affect its regime (except for an



- 20 -
insignificant reduction during the six-month period of reservoir filling),
the project would not adversely affect the downstream riparian state (Mexico).
The rainy season starts in May and ends in October. During reservoir filling
which, at the earliest, would start in February 1981 and would not extend
beyond the end of the rainy season, the average annual flow of the river at
the Mexican border point is not expected to be r2duced by more than 10% (the
tributary area to the Chixoy reservoir--5,700 km --represents no more than
about 6% of the total Usumacinta watershed). The proposed hydroelectric
development of the Chixoy river would be carried out by damming its course and
conveying the impounded waters through a 25.6 km tunnel and a drop of 550
meters to obtain 300 MW of power.  The project's principal works are described
below, with the financing source involved for each principal component:
(a) Generation (see Figure 4.3 - Map IBRD 13048):
-  rockfill dam 108 m high with a volume of 2.8 million cubic
meters that would form a reservoir with a volume of 424 million
cubic meters. The dam would be located about 57.5 km upstream
of the confluence of the Chixoy and Quixal rivers (80 km north
of Guatemala City) -- IBRD;
- power tunnel 25.6 km long, concrete lined, 4.8 m in diameter,
to develop a gross head of 550 m -- IDB; and
- surface powerhouse with 5x60 MW generating units driven by
vertically mounted Pelton turbines -- IDB and suppliers'
credits.
(b) Transmission -- IBRD:
- step-up substation (400 MVA, 13.8/230 kV);
- 230 kV double circuit transmission line to Guatemala City
(120 km); and
(c) Subtransmission lines and substations (69) kV, construction of
which would be initiated by January 1, 1979 and completed by
December 31, 1981 -- IBRD;
(d) Engineering and studies:
- Engineering and construction supervision for Chixoy -- IDB;
- individual transmission line consultants (para 3.02),
13 man months -- IBRD; and
- tariff study (para 2.04), 28 man months -- IBRD



- 21 -
4.08      The dam will be designed to prevent uncontrolled release of the
reservoir under a maximum credible earthquake (MCE) of 7.7 magnitude; 1/
waich will result in peak horizontal ground accelerations of 0.69 g and a
diration of strong shaking of 33 sec at the dam site; under operating basis
earthquake (OBE) the works would safely function under a peak horizontal
acceleration of 0.3 g. Spillway design will allow discharge of a maximum
flood with recurrence period of 1 in 10,000 years (spillway peak discharge of
4,000 m3/sec), while maintaining a minimum free-board in the dam of 1.5 m.
With a probable high sedimentation rate of 977 cubic meters per square
kilometer, the expected useful reservoir life would be about 200 years. The
tunnel siphon, located about 8 km downstream of the dam, will be designed for
safe shutdown after a potential displacement of 3.5 m horizontal and 1.0 m
vertical along the Polochic-Chixoy-Cuilco fault (see Figure 4.2--map) during
the postulate MCE. The works, designed with these criteria, should behave
reliably and safely under the worst foreseeable conditions.
4.09      The transmission system arrangement as well as sizing and siting of
substations proposed by INDE and its consultants is adequate for the system
and within acceptable levels of voltage regulation, losses and reliability.
On completion of the project, the ratio of step-down substation capacity to
maximum demand at INDE's points of delivery in the Central system would have
increased from a relatively low 1.10 to a more adequate level of 1.25. In the
remaining systems served by INDE alone, the ratio would range from 1.25 to
1.5, which is satisfactory. EEG has programmed the expansion of its distribu-
tion substations in coordination with INDE's substation expansions and the
adopted incremental transformation capacities in EEG's system would provide
correspondingly adequate reserves and reliability. The envisaged improvement
in reserve capacity indicates that reliability would be substantially improved
without overinvestment.
Froject Cost
4.10      The project's estimated cost is US$372.7 million, with a US$204.1
million foreign component. Total financing requirements, including interest
during construction, are US$414.1 million, as shown in the following table.

Financing of interest on the Bank loan during construction is proposed in
order to alleviate the heavy financial strain caused by INDE's large invest-
ment program, which is far in excess of its revenue-generating capacity based
on its present assets. INDE will have to obtain substantial additional
financing for the program and is already expecting a high level of Government
financing. It would, therefore, not be reasonable to expect that the finan-
cial charges on the Bank loan during the construction period be financed by
sources other than the Bank.
4.12      The above costs are based on September 1977 prices and, with the
exception of the transmission system, and subtransmission lines and sub-
stations, on actual contracts for project works. Costs for the items not yet
contracted were based on recent (October 1977) estimates by INDE's staff and
consultants, LAMI. 1/ All base costs are reasonable and physical contingency
allowances of 5% for equipment, 10% for minor civil works, and 24% for the
dam and tunnel are adequate. The physical contingengy allowance for the dam
is sufficient to cover the mean in the range of estimates by LAMI and INDE's
Board of Consultants 2/ of the additional costs for foundation excavation and
treatment that could be required, in case subsurface conditions prove to
be less favorable than expected. The physical contingency allowance for the
tunnel is based on a probability analysis made by Bank staff.
4.13      Allowances for price increases have been added to the cost estimate
using the following annual escalation:
International      Local
1978-79                   7.5%            9%
1980-82                   7%              8%
Engineering and administration expenditures reflect an existing contract 3/
between INDE and LAMI for design engineering and construction supervision of
the project. The amount of foreign consulting services proposed for Bank
financing has been estimated on the basis of an average cost of US$4,750 per
man-month (excluding travel and subsistence). All these costs are reasonable.
Engineering and Project Execution
4.14      All engineering phases of the Chixoy project are being carried out
by LAMI who will also perform construction supervision. INDE expects to execute
the project by contracting all major works, as well as the supply and instal-
lation of equipment. During project execution INDE will receive advice from
its Board of Consultants on all phases of final design and construction.

4.15      The Chixoy project is expected to be in commercial operation by
June 30, 1982. Table 4.2 contains the project implementation schedule, which
will serve as a basis to monitor project progress. Figure 4.1 shows the
project's construction schedule.
Procurement and Disbursement
4.16      Procurement of equipment, materials and constructiorn services to be
financed by the Bank for the project will be through international competitive
bidding (ICB) in accordance with Bank procurement guidelines. In order to
meet INDE's construction program for the project, the diversion works had to
be initiated before the 1977 rainy season (June to October). Although con-
struction of the main dam could be started a year later, the possibility
existed that contractors would tend to bid lower for the combined works
(diversion and main dam) than if they were tendered separately. On this
assumption, INDE requested that advance bidding for the main dam be allowed.
The Bank accepted, under the condition that contract signing for the dam would
only take place after Bank approval of the proposed loan. The bidder with the
lowest evaluated responsive bid for both diversion and the dam was COGEFAR
(Italy). INDE, in April 1977, with Bank concurrence issued a letter of intent
to COGEFAR to sign both contracts. River diversion work has already commenced
and is being financed by INDE. In order not to delay the contractor's mobil-
ization for main dam construction INDE has already given the contractor a down
payment for both diversion and the dam (although contract signing for the dam
would not take place until the Bank approves the proposed loan). Retroactive
financing under the proposed loan for expenses incurred after October 14, 1977,
in the amount of approximately US$7 million for the foreign exchange component
of the down payment and progress payments for the dam is recommended.
Procurement of all other major project items (except for transmission and
subtransmission works) has been completed. 1/
4.17      Disbursements from the Bank loan would be made for:
(a) 62% of total expenditures for the dam and spillway (repre-
senting the estimated foreign cost component);
(b) 100% of the foreign cost of imported equipment and materials
for the transmission system and for the subtransmission (69 kV)
lines and substations;
(c) 100% of the foreign cost of services of consultants and
transmission line specialists; and
(d) 100% of the financial charges on the Bank loan up to December 31,
1981.
1/   Under procedures of IDB, tunnel and powerhouse contracts were awarded
in May 1977 to Hochtief (Germany) and ICA (Mexico), respectively.
Through ICB, under Guatemalan procurement regulations, contracts were
awarded in January and February 1978 for the turbines to Escher Wyss
(Switzerland); for generators and transformers to Mitsubishi (Japan); and
for hydro-mechanical equipment to SOREFAME (Portugal).

The closing date would be June 30, 1982, expected date of Chixoy project works
completion and about six months after the estimated completion of the project
components to be financed with the proposed Bank loan.
Environment
4.18      Studies performed by INDE's consultant ecologists and covering human
ecology, flora, fauna, hydrology, and archaeology indicate that the project's
environmental effect would not be significant. Although the area to be flooded
by the reservoir is sparsely populated, about 1,500 people would need to be
relocated; measures would have to be taken to ensure adequate public health
conditions in the construction camps; and measures should be taken to safeguard
archaeological treasures that could be found. In order to prepare a program to
protect the environment in the project zone of influence, Government obtained on
January 25, 1977 from the IDB a grant of US$1.51 million for technical assis-
tance. This grant would also finance the preparation of a program for the
economic and social development of the project zone. In order to safeguard the
project area's archaeological treasures, INDE signed an agreement in January
1977 with the Instituto de Antropologia e Historia to carry out all required
investigations in this area and take appropriate action. With respect to
public health, INDE has made official arrangements with the Direccion General
de Servicios de Salud and the Instituto Guatemalteco de Seguridad Social.
In addition, for the Aguacapa (Loan 1426-GU) and Chixoy project's principal
construction camp sites, specific areas for squatter settlement have been
defined and basic services will be provided in these areas for water, waste
disposal, and security. The Bank has received for review the respective plans
for the orderly development of the camp sites and squatters settlements. The
environmental protection program to be undertaken is comprehensive. Neverthe-
less (in addition to the normal commitment to carry out the project with due
regard to ecological matters), the Bank obtained assurances from Government
and INDE that a program will be implemented to compensate adequately and, if



- 26 -
necessary, resettle, those residents (about 1,500) of the area to be flooded
by the reservoir whose living and working conditions have been adversely
affected by such flooding. INDE will prepare such a program and present it
for Bank review by December 31, 1979. In order to effectively control erosion
in the watershed contributing to the proposed Chixoy reservoir, INDE will
prepare a suitable program and present it to the Bank for review also by
December 31, 1979, and Government will start to implement it by June 30, 1980.
Project Risk
4.19      All bids received for the project have confirmed that INDE's project
construction schedule is attainable, although somewhat optimistic. Under its
present schedule, INDE expects commercial operation of the Chixoy plant by
October 1981. Considerable and comprehensive geologic investigations have been
carried out and the tunnel contractor is financially liable if, under normal
circumstances, the tunnel is not completed by August 1981. Nevertheless,
considerable risks are involved in constructing a tunnel of thi s length (25.6
km), under unfavorable geological conditions (heterogeneous and karstic
formations) and with only three headings. Based on the probability analysis
performed by Bank staff (para. 4.12), commercial operation by june 1982
appears more likely, and this assumption has been incorporated in the cost
estimates and the economic analysis contained in Chapter 6.
4.20      Geophysicists who have studied the effects of the February 1976
Guatemala earthquake are in agreement that its cause appears to have been the
movement of lithospheric plates producing a massive rupture along the Motagua
fault (see Figure 4.2). Geologic investigations at the site of the proposed
Chixoy hydroelectric project have not disclosed adverse effects from the
quake; the proposed project works would be located at about 50 km north of the
Motagua fault. Another major fault (Polochic-Chixoy-Cuilco), which runs
parallel to the Motagua fault and about 50 km north of it, passes within 5.5
km of the site of the proposed Chixoy dam. No relative movements with respect
to the Polochic-Chixoy-Cuilco fault have been observed and INDE's consultants
have confirmed this through precise geologic surveys recently carried out.
In addition to these precautions, the project works will be designed to with-
stand severe seismic effects (para. 4.08). INDE's Board of Consultants has
reviewed the project's design; the board's recommendations are being imple-
mented in final designs and construction procedures for the project works.
The Board of Consultants would be retained to advise INDE through project
completion. INDE agreed to cause major project works (dam, waterways,
earthworks, and reservoir banks) to be inspected periodically in accordance
with appropriate engineering practice, in order to determine whether there are
any deficiencies or potential deficiencies in the condition of such structures
and earthworks which may endanger the safety of such works.

CHAPTER 5
FINANCES
Background
5.01      Despite the recent Government decision to maintain the separation
between INDE and EEG (para. 1.18), this chapter retains the sector (INDE/EEG
consolidated) approach of the report dealing with the Aguacapa project (Loan
1426-GU). Because the main market for INDE's generation is served through
EEG's distribution system, individual company analysis provides only a partial
and less meaningful evaluation of financial performance than that which is
obtained on a consolidated basis. Moreover, it is essential to assure finan-
cing not only for INDE but for EEG as well, both through an adequate blend of
consumer-based resources, borrowings and capital investment by Government.
The mobilization of a reasonable proportion of consumer-based resources
relative to the overall expansion investment depends, in turn, upon the
development and implementation of a coordinated, economically and financially
sound sector tariff policy. Accordingly it was agreed under Loan 1426-GU that
the power sector's pricing policy should be based on providing an adequate
internally generated contribution to the sector investment program, and that
the Government should meet with its own capital investment the short-term
financing shortfalls arising from the need to carry out a substantial hydro-
electric expansion program to alleviate the country's dependence on imported
fuel. This policy is appropriate considering the special circumstances of the
sector explained in Chapter 1. It is also consistent with the findings of the
project performance audit of INDE's first and second power projects and of the
August 1975 sector mission (paras. 1.08-21).
Past Earnings and Financial Position
5.02      The power sector's financial performance in 1971-73 was satisfactory
(see Tables 5.1, 5.3 and 5.4). It achieved an average rate of return of 10%
on historically-valued assets, a high debt-service coverage ratio (4.2 times)
and a substantial contribution to its modest investment program (51%). This
satisfactory performance, however, resulted from the high earnings achieved by
EEG, which more than offset INDE's poor performance. During the same (1971-73)
period, INDE's rate of return on historically-valued assets averaged 5.9%
only, which in turn resulted from its not charging adequate bulk tariffs to
EEG, its principal customer.
5.03      The sector's financial performance in 1974-75 was unsatisfactory,
primarily because the sharp rise in fuel costs was not fully passed on to
ultimate consumers. Consolidated net income dropped in 1974 to 58% of the
previous year's level and did not reach its 1973 level until 1976. During
this period (1974-75) the sector's rate of return on historically-valued
assets averaged 6.3%; INDE's, 4.2%. While debt service coverage remained
satisfactory (2.4 times), the sector was only able to finance 17% of its
investment program from internal resources despite the fact that it had
not undertaken any major investment to counter the increase in fuel costs.
By 1976 the sector rate of return had improved to 8.2% and the internal
contribution was 32%.



- 31 -
5.04      A further improvement was expected in 1977, as the Government had
agreed that prior to the effectiveness of Loan 1426-GU it would increase
tariffs to enable the power sector to finance 15% of its investment program
from internal resources during 1977-79. By September 1977 the Government had
not taken action because it considered that introduction of an increase during
a period of poor electricity service (para. 3.03) would have been politically
unwise. After discussions with a Guatemalan delegation, the Bank informed
Government in October 1977 that it was prepared to waive the 1977 revenue
requirement. However, effectiveness of Loan 1426-GU would be dependent on
Government confirmation that tariffs would be raised in order to meet the 13%
contribution required for 1978, and an introduction of at least a 6% tariff
increase in 1977. On November 1, 1977 Government increased tariffs by
US$0.004/kWh (approximately 7%). Despite the delay in increasing tariffs, the
sector achieved a 21% contribution to its investments in 1977. 1/ This
resulted from a larger than previously expected reduction in working capital
(mainly due to a high level of accounts payable). As a result of the delay in
raising tariffs, sector operating income declined from US$8.1 million in 1976
to about US$3.6 million in 1977; this compares with a forecast of US$17.7
million in the Aguacapa appraisal report.
5.05      In view of the likelihood that the March 1978 presidential elections
could delay a governmental decision on the tariff increases necessary to
ensure the financial soundness of the sector, presentation of the proposed
loan to the Executive Directors was made contingent on the implementation
of the balance of the tariff adjustments required to provide a contribution
of 13% from internally generated funds to sector investment in 1978. The
Government decided to implement a 10% tariff increase for INDE and EEG retail
consumers effective May 1 and a further 8.5% increase not later than December
1978. 2/ These increases should achieve the 13% contribution in 1978, provided
delays are not experienced in commissioning the fuel purifier in EEG's La
Laguna plant (para 4.01).
5.06      The Government agreed under Loan 1426-GU that the power sector
should earn a rate of return of at least 9% on its average revalued net fixed
assets in operation after the Aguacapa project is completed. INDE agreed to
hire consultants to carry out a revaluation study of all existing sector
assets and to design a procedure by which assets can be revalued annually by
means of the application of standard indexing, though annual application of
the procedure was not required under the Loan Agreement. The consumer price
index in Guatemala increased at an average annual rate of 10% during the years
1973-76 and the cost of electric power plants, as measured by the U.S. Bureau
of Reclamation, increased at about the same rate. Even if Guatemala returns
to the price stability it enjoyed before, the power sector should still be
protected against inflation in the countries from which it purchases the bulk
1/   This is a preliminary figure based on EEG's 1977 audited accounts and
INDE's unaudited accounts.
2/   Tariff to INDE's bulk supply customers (mainly the municipal power
companies) were increased by 10% on June 1, 1978. These customers
represent about 4% of INDE's sales revenues.



- 32 -
of its equipment. The Government agreed that the sector's net fixed assets
would be valued on an annual basis after completion of Aguacapa. At the same
time, the required rate of return was reduced from 9% to 8%, which, combined
with annual review of asset values, should result in adequate resources being
contributed by power sector consumers to finance future investment.
5.07      Though the sector's overall current position was good during
1975-1976, it reflected the strong position of INDE rather than the weaker one
of EEG. At the end of 1976 INDE's accounts receivable were equivalent to 59
days of sales, 1/ while EEG's totalled 83 days, mainly as a result of its
excessive accounts receivable from public agencies. Under Loan 1426-GU,
Government agreed to take all necessary measures to reduce the sector's
accounts receivable from public agencies to a maximum of 60 days of billings
by the end of 1977. As a move to achieve this goal, Government decided to
settle EEG's accounts receivable of US$4.4 million (September 1977) with
EMPAGUA, the Guatemala City municipal water utility (which accounted for about
half the sector's accounts receivable from public agencies at the end of
1976), through a commitment to pay the debt in five years, starting in 1978.
In addition, Government decreed to provide funds through June 30, 1978 to
ensure payment of EMPAGUA's debt to EEG to that date, and to pay 75% of
EMPAGUA's electricity billings until December 31, 1978 or initial operation of
the new Xaya-Piscaya water supply project, whichever event is sooner; the new
project would substantially reduce EMPAGUA's electricity consumption. Since
the tariff arrangements under Loan 1426-GU should protect EEG from any insuffi-
ciency of funds, 2/ the net effect of the arrangement will be that Government
will have to increase its contributions to INDE to offset the deferral of the
US$4.4 million over the next five years. As a result of the above, there has
been an improvement in sector accounts receivable from public sector entities
which have been reduced from the equivalent of 365 days of sales as of the end
of 1976 to 220 days as of the end of 1977. Despite a substantial improvement,
the 60-day target was not achieved, largely because several municipalities
which buy power in bulk from INDE for distribution within their jurisdiction
have refused to pay a fuel surcharge applied by INDE in 1977. The situation
became critical at one point and troops had to be called in to quell disturb-
ances (including the burning of an INDE office in one of the towns concerned).
As a result of these problems, INDE's accounts receivable from other public
sector entities (excluding EEG) have risen from the equivalent of 277 days at
the end of 1976 to 350 days at the end of 1977. It should be noted that the
amounts involved are not large (totaling US$1.8 million for EEG and US$3.1
million for INDE as of December 1977). It should therefore not be difficult
for Government to secure a settlement of these accounts. Therefore, it was
agreed that the terminal date for compliance with the covenant on accounts
receivable be postponed from December 31, 1977 to December 31, 1978. In
addition, during negotiations on the proposed loan, a satisfactory program
for achieving the revised target was defined.
1/   At the same time, INDE's accounts receivable from customers other than
EEG stood at 126 days (see Table 5.1).
2/   INDE's tariffs to EEG are to be adjusted to allow EEG to cover its
requirements from internally generated funds.

5.09      INDE would be responsible for US$565.3 million or 94% of the sector's
investment; EEG for US$35.6 million (6%). Tariff increases referred to in
para. 5.15 should provide consumer-based resources sufficient to cover rapidly
increasing debt service requirements and provide self-financing for 28% of the
sector's large investment requirements (13% and 16% in 1978 and 1979 of the
respective average annual investments, and 14% of the total 1978-1979 invest-
ment). Borrowings (drawdowns) totalling US$326.8 million for the sector would
cover an additional 54% of the financing requirements. They would be as follows:



- 34 -
(a) US$58.1 million for the Aguacapa project including US$55.0
million from Loan 1426-GU, and US$3.1 million from CABEI.
(b) US$209.5 million for Chixoy including loans already secured
from the IDB (US$80.0 million), CABEI (US$8.6 million),
supplier's credit (US$25.9 million), and loans yet to be
secured which include the proposed Bank loan (US$72.0
million), and US$23.0 million from undetermined sources.
(c) US$59.2 million for other ongoing and future projects (para.
4.03) as follows:

-  Commercial Bank (EEG)              2.5                Planned
59.2
5.10      Details of the above borrowings are shown in Annex A (Table A5).  The
Bank loan was assumed to be for a period of 17 years (including 4 years of
grace) with interest at 7.5% p.a. The financing plan also includes provision
of US$105.7 million in Government capital contributions to INDE. Government
secured a loan (US$32.8 million of which US$12.9 million would be disbursed
in 1978-82) from FIV in 1976 to be contributed to INDE as equity for the
Chixoy project. A second loan of US$30 million from FIV was obtained in 1977
for equity contribution to the Aguacapa project. A third loan to the Govern-
ment for Chixoy from FIV (US$37.2 million) is anticipated in 1979, and is also
expected to be contributed by the Government as equity. Details of the sector
financing plan (para 5.08) are shown in Table 5.2.
5.11      The Bank has offered INDE assistance in obtaining, through cofinancing
arrangements, part of the funds that they require. INDE has already received
several proposals on attrative terms from commercial banks. The Bank obtained
assurances from Government that it will provide or cause to provide to INDE
the following funds:



- 35 -
(a)  the balance of the financing required for the Chixoy project
(US$23 million in future borrowings and US$50.1 million in
equity contributions); 1/
(b)  equity contributions for the Aguacapa project, other committed
projects, and the Guatemala Sur-Guatemala Norte 230 kV
transmission line and Guatemala Norte substation 2/ which
will deliver Chixoy power to Guatemala City; these contri-
butions total US$55.6 million in 1978-1982 1/ (see Table 5.2).
5.12      The financing plan is satisfactory.  The sector still has to secure
US$45.2 million of borrowings for its program exclusive of Chixoy in the
period 1978-82. Of this amount US$38.5 million is expected to be provided by
USAID, IDB, and CABEI for INDE projects; the balance should be available from
commercial banks. To ensure adequate review of future sector investments
and financial planning, the Government and INDE agreed to the following
provisions (similar agreements were -Xeaclned under Loan 1426-GU):
(a)  EEG's investments would not exceed US$11.5 million in 1978,
US$5.9 million in 1979, US$6.1 million in 1980, US$6.4
million in 1981 and US$6.7 million in 1982, without the
agreement of the Bank; and
(b)  INDE would not incur any debt without the agreement
of the Bank if its most recent 12-month internal cash
generation is less than 1.5 times the maximum debt
service requirement in any future year.
5.13      For reasons noted in para. 6.02, a provision of the Aguacapa loan
agreement requiring the Bank's approval of major new projects undertaken by
INDE prior to completion of Aguacapa would be amended.
Future Earnings and Financial Position
5.14      As noted in the appraisal of the Aguacapa Project, the tariff
policies pursued in the power sector during the construction period of the
Chixoy project will have to strike an appropriate balance between long-
term economic considerations (which indicate that tariffs should reflect
the lower production costs which will be achieved when the project is com-
missioned) and the short-term financial needs of the sector, resulting
from the high cost of fuel and the large size of its investment program.
1/   The agreed Government contributions to INDE include US$14.3 million
of funds which would be offset by repayment of an interest free advance
to INDE in 1977. Thus, the gross 1978-82 equity contributions for
Chixoy and other program work is US$120 million.
2/   This component (line and substation) of the investment program is esti-
mated to cost US$18.4 million; a loan of approximately US$12.5 million
would be provided to INDE by CABEI to finance it.

The assumptions underlying the 1978-83 projections are similar to those
used in the Aguacapa appraisal, with adjustments to reflect changes in the
investment program and cost increases and the actual timing and amounts of
tariff increases.
5.15      The projections assume an 8.5% retail tariff increase effective
December 1, 1978 and increases in 1979 which would raise average tariffs for
the year by 7.6% over the December 1978 level. 1/ With these increases the
sector would finance 13% and 16% of the annual average investments in 1978 and
1979, respectively. Over the remaining construction period of the Chixoy
project (1978-82) the sector would finance 28% of its investment program from
internal resources; the annual contributions would be 33%, 43% and 77% in
1980, 1981 and 1982, respectively (see Table 5.1).
5.16      Debt service coverage under these assumptions would be adequate,
as shown in Table 5.1, averaging 2.1 in 1978-1982. The sector's debt equity
ratio would rise from 29/71 in 1977 to a high of 45/55 in 1980-1981 and
decline thereafter. Although data is not available on revalued assets (see
para. 5.06), a rough estimate indicates that the sector's rate of return on
revalued net plant in operation would be approximately 6% in 1978 and that it
would exceed 8% in 1979-1982.
5.17      Individual projections for INDE and EEG as presently constituted are
shown in Annex A (Tables Al to A4). These projections assume that INDE's
bulk tariffs to EEG would be adjusted annually to transfer to INDE any funds
generated by EEG in excess of the latter's requirements for operations,
debt service, working capital and construction. Government and INDE agreed
under Loan 1426-GU to implement this tariff policy.
5.18      The Government and INDE agreed to revenue requirement covenants
under the proposed loan similar to those incorporated in the agreements for
Loan 1426-GU:
(a)  Sector retail tariffs would be set at levels sufficient to
achieve a 13% and 16% annual contribution to investment in
1978 and 1979, respectively;
(b)  Starting with 1980, retail tariffs would be set at levels
sufficient to earn an 8% rate of return on average revalued
consolidated net fixed assets in operation, valued annually;
(c)  INDE's bulk tariffs to EEG would be adjusted annually to
transfer to INDE any funds generated by EEG in excess of
the latter's requirements for operations, debt service,
working capital and construction;
1/   Exclusive of any additional increases which may be required to cover
fuel price rises (see para. 5.18(d)).



- 37 -
(d) fuel price increases will be passed on automatically to
consumers; and
(e) power sector tariff rates would not be reduced without
the agreement of the Bank before the project is completed.
Performance Indicators
5.19      Annex A (Table A7) contains a representative selection of indicators
of INDE's operating and financial performance (other than those covered by
proposed covenants) through the year following project completion. Perfor-
mance as measured by these indicators would be monitored during project
execution.

/ During negotiations, a Government commitment to make this amount available to INDE in the form of loans and/or equity, was obtained.
2/ During negotiations, a Government commitment to make this amount of equity available for the Chixoy project was obtained.  Government has already borrowed US$32.8 million
in 1976 from FlV to be contributed as equity to the Chixoy project. A second loan from FIV to the Government of US$37.2 million in 1979 is anticipated.
/ During negotiations, a Government commitment to make these amounts available to INDE as equity for committed works was obtained. A US$30 million loan to Government from
FPV was secured in 1977 to be contributed as equity for the Aguacapa project.

CHAPTER 6
ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
Least-Cost Solution
6.01      During the Bank appraisal of the Aguacapa power project in March
1976, the least-cost generation expansion program for the sector in the
period 1979-1989 was identified as consisting of the Aguacapa and Chixoy
hydroelectric projects and the Moyuta geothermal plant. Since that appraisal,
the Chixoy project's estimated cost has increased by 17%; the planned Moyuta
geothermal plant has not proved economic because of inadequate steam temper-
atures; a combined cycle thermal plant (para. 4.01) has been added to the
program; and construction of the Chixoy project is underway. The adequate
system reserve margins incorporated in the original program would be main-
tained with the proposed combined cycle plant, which would in addition result
in reduction of investment and operating costs. Consequently, the program
segment to 1982 (when additional capacity would be required) is even more
attractive than the originally defined least-cost program. According to the
recent report (July 1977) prepared by the Master Plan Group, the Serchil
hydroelectric plant (110 MW), which would be operated for peaking, would
follow Chixoy. In order to determine whether Chixoy has been a sound invest-
ment decision, a retrospective economic comparison was carried out using 1976
as base year. The Chixoy-Serchil program segment was compared with an alter-
native program consisting of the only feasible alternative to meet the load
in 1982, i.e., a steam generating plant to be commissioned in that year,
followed by the Xalala hydroelectric plant (installed capacity 348 MW, firm
227 MW) which, from the Master Plan study, has generating capabilities similar
to Chixoy and could be commissioned by mid-1985. The result of the comparison
shows that the Chixoy-Serchil program has a lower cost at discount rates below
13%. The Chixoy-Serchil program was further compared with an all thermal
program composed of four steam generating units, to enter in operation sequen-
tially between 1982 and 1985. The latter comparison shows that the Chixoy-
Serchil program is a lower cost alternative of discount rates below 18%.
Treating the 1977 investment (US$75 million) in Chixoy as sunk cost, the
Chixoy-Serchil program, compared to the thermal-Xalala alternative, has a
lower cost at discount rates below 21%. A summary of the comparisons is shown
in Table 6.1.
6.02      Government informed the Bank during negotiations that it was
considering two changes in the investment program identified in the course
of appraisal. The first would be the addition of a hydro plant of about
50 MW (Santa Maria II) 1/ to the program. The second would be to advance
the work on the next major project after Chixoy (which might not be Serchil
because, according to INDE, recent geological investigations have indicated
that it may be less attractive than other projects under study). A decision
to proceed with Santa Maria II and earlier construction of the next project
1/   The proposed plant would be located at the site of the existing but
inoperable Santa Maria I hydroplant near the city of Quezaltenango;
would be designed as a run-of-the-river station by utilizing the
waters of the Samala river; and, through a drop of about 450 meters,
develop between 30 and 50 MW.

might be justified if sales growth is substantially higher than forecast in
Chapter 3. If the results of the study of the feasibility of supplying
Exmibal from the central system (para. 3.02) demonstrate the justification
of such a link, however, additional capacity may be required earlier than
presently anticipated. If increases in the demand on the interconnected
system cannot be substantiated, however, the program with such modifications
is likely to be less economically attractive than the present program (which
envisages commissioning of the next major project in 1987). The uncertainty
on the proposed new investments cannot be resolved until further studies,
presently being prepared by INDE and its consultants, are received and reviewed
by the Bank. Assurances were obtained from INDE that until the completion of
the Chixoy project INDE will inform the Bank of any proposed capital expendi-
ture in excess of US$5 million 1/ for investments not included in the expan-
sion program (para. 4.02) and furnish to the Bank, within a reasonable period
before the proposed date of such expenditure, a report for comment showing the
economic and financial justification of such expenditure. This provision
amends the more stringent requirement under Loan 1426-GU, wherein the Bank
reserved for itself the right of approval of projects not included in the
expansion program. During negotiations on the proposed loan Government
representatives requested the change stating that the previous provision had
complicated Congressional ratification of Loan 1426-GU. The revised language
was accepted in view of the provision of the proposed Guarantee Agreement (see
para. 1.17(a)), under which Government agreed to take all action necessary
to coordinate expansion and operation of generating, transmission, and
distribution facilities of all electric utility entities, operating within
the interconnected system, in order to prevent waste of energy, duplication
of facilities and unnecessary investment, and ensure that expansion of such
facilities is based on economically justifiable programs. This requirement
would cover both INDE and EEG investments in the interconnected system.
Return on Investment
6.03      The return on investment for the 1978-1982 investment program has
been estimated to be 13%. This return has been calculated by equating the
present worth of the stream of incremental system investment and operating
costs associated with the program with the present worth of benefits as
measured by forecast revenues from sale of electricity at the retail level and
fuel savings (Table 6.2). The main uncertainties which may affect this return
are those associated with large civil works projects (which should be adequately
covered by the physical contingency allowances) and the possiblity of lower-
than-expected sales revenues, which could result from failure to raise tariffs
as required to comply with the revenue covenants or lower than forecast growth
in sales. Finally, as noted in para 6.02, the Government may decide to under-
take additional generation investments which would reduce the benefits from
fuel savings and sales revenues attributable to the projects comprising the
1/   Increased from US$1 million under Loan 1426-GU to reduce the frequency of
Bank involvement.

present program. 1/ Should investments on the agreed 1978-1982 program be
10% higher than estimated and sales be 15% lower than forecast, the corres-
ponding return would be 11%.
6.04      The above calculations probably understate the benefits of the
project as the electricity rates, which were used as the measure of benefits,
may not fully consider the indirect benefits to industry and commerce, whose
production and employment depend on a reliable electricity supply, or the
benefits of residential and public uses. However, even on the basis used,
the range of rates of return obtained for the program indicate that it is
economically justified, and that electricity prices will, on average, be in
line with incremental system costs, suggesting that wasteful use of energy
will be avoided. The tariff structure studies referred to in Chapter 1
will permit Government and the utilities to introduce adjustments to eliminate
any distortions which may be identified in particular tariff categories.
1/   If Government decides to develop Santa Maria II for commissioning by
1982, the return on investment would be about 12%. The impact of
advancing the next major project does not show up in the present
calculation, since such a project could not be commissioned by 1982.

CHAPTER 7
SUMMARY OF PROPOSED AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      During negotiations agreements were reached with Government and
INDE on the following points:
-    With Government, that it will:
(a)  cause the power sector to take all action necessary to:  (i) coordi-
nate the expansion and operation of generating, transmission and
distribution facilities of all electric utility entities operating
within the Interconnected System in order to prevent waste of
energy, duplication of facilities and unnecessary investment; and
(ii) ensure that expansion of such facilities will be based on
economically justifiable programs (para. 1.17(a));
(b)  carry out the power sector reorganization and use its best efforts
to complete it by December 31, 1979 (para. 1.18);
(c)  put into effect by June 30, 1980 a program aimed at controlling
erosion in the watershed tributary to the reservoir to be
formed by the Chixoy dam (para. 4.18);
(d)  cause EEG's construction expenditures to be limited to $11.5 mil-
lion in 1978, $5.9 million in 1979, $6.1 in 1980, $6.4 in 1981,
and $1.7 in 1982 (para 5.12(a));
(e)  cause revenues of the power sector to be sufficient to finance
sector investments from internally generated funds no less than
13% in 1978, 16% in 1979, and 18% thereafter until the Aguacapa
project has been completed, and achieve an 8% rate of return
on annually valued assets thereafter (paras. 5.06 and 5.18);
(f)  cause power sector accounts receivable from public agencies to
be reduced to two months of billings by December 31, 1978
(para 5.07);
(g)  make loans, or cause loans to be made to INDE or make contri-
butions to INDE's equity aggregating to not less than $36 million,
$23 million, $19 million, $17 million, and $17 million during
1978, 1979, 1980, 1981, and 1982, respectively; provided, however,
that such Government contributions to INDE during 1978, 1979,
and 1980, amount to not less than $22 million, $14 million,
and $5 million, respectively (para. 5.11);
(h)  cause EEG to transfer to INDE all funds available to EEG in
excess of EEG's requirements for operations, repayment of
debt, net working capital and capital expenditures (para 5.18(c));



- 48 -
(i) cause power sector rates to be adjusted automatically to cover
additional operating expenses resulting from variations in the
prices paid for fuel by the power sector (para 5.18 (d)); and
(j) not reduce power sector rates without the agreement of the Bank
before the project is completed (5.18(e)).
-    With INDE, that it will:
(a) cause consultants to carry out a tariff study and to complete
it by July 31, 1979 (para 1.21);
(b) carry out a study with consultants on the feasibility of
supplying Exmibal, located in the Atlantic coast, through
the Interconnected System, and complete the study by March 31,
1979 (para 3.02);
(c) furnish to the Bank by December 31, 1979 a program of action to
adequately compensate and, if necessary, resettle, those
residents of the area to be flooded by the Chixoy reservoir
(para 4.18);
(d) present to the Bank, not later than December 31, 1979 a program
aimed at controlling erosion in the watershed tributary to the
Chixoy reservoir (para 4.18);
(e) make arrangements by June 30, 1982 to cause the dam, waterways,
and earthworks included in the project to be periodically
inspected (para 4.20);
(f) not incur any debt without the agreement of the Bank if its most
recent 12-months internal cash generation is less than 1.5 times
the maximum debt service requirement in any future year
(para. 5.12(b)); and
(g)  (i) inform the Bank on any proposal of INDE to make any capital
expenditure for its expansion program, other than expenditures
required for the agreed program; and (ii) furnish to the Bank
within a reasonable period before the proposed date of such
capital expenditure, for comment, a report showing that such
capital expenditure is economically justified and financially
sound, and that financing is available under terms and conditions
which will not adversely affect INDE's financial position, the
carrying out of the project or any other power project financed
by the Bank (para 6.02).
7.02      Before declaring the loan effective, the Bank should receive satis-
factory evidence that the subsidiary contract between Government, INDE, and
EEG has been amended to reflect therein the execution and delivery of the Loan
and Guarantee Agreements of the proposed loan and that the satisfactorily



- 49 -
amended subsidiary contract has been duly authorized or ratified by, and
executed and delivered on behalf of, respectively, Government, INDE and EEG
(para. 1.18(c)).
7.03      With the above agreements, the project constitutes a suitable
basis for a Bank loan of US$72 million equivalent. The loan would be repaid
over a period of 17 years, including 4 years of grace.
