1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal
1.     The economies of the OECS faced a dual challenge of slowing economic growth;
and persistently high unemployment and poverty rates. Issues that inhibited regional
economic dynamism included reduced preferential market access for traditional crop
exports, stiffer competition from other tourism destinations, fiscal imbalances and high
public sector debt levels. This trend was compounded in the early 2000s by several
external shocks including natural disasters, 9/11, the slowdown in the global economy
and the increase in oil prices.
2.     It was essential for the region to address these issues. It had to improve
competitiveness in order to safeguard investment inflows; reinvigorate growth and
generate employment. It also had to create new areas of competitive advantage in the
global economy to create a more stable economy, and a less vulnerable platform for
economic development and poverty reduction.
3.      Key development challenges were identified in the World Bank's 2001-05
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for the OECS, presented to the Board on June 4,
2001. They were: promoting sustainable, private sector-led economic diversification by
providing a supportive environment for promising, newly emerging service industries;
improving the provision of public services to the population, and strengthening the
broader functioning of the public sector. A Bank report on growth and competitiveness
issues in the OECS indicated that improving the quality of, and the access, (while
reducing the cost of) to telecommunication services, was critical to stimulate growth and
improve competitiveness. Not only in ICT activities, but also in emerging clusters of
other services such as niche tourism, offshore education, and offshore financial services.
4.      Improved telecommunications would create interconnecting economic effects
through all sectors of the economy. Results that would impact positively on the growth of
sectors such as tourism, agriculture, and manufacturing, included higher quality, lower
prices and greater variety of telecommunications services. In particular, a competitive
telecommunications sector was essential for the emergence of information and
technology services, such as outsourcing information processing. ICT could also
contribute to the elimination of geographical barriers facing small remote states; thereby
promoting global integration.
5.     A newly liberalized and regulated telecommunications sector in the OECS opened
up opportunities. In 1998, five Member States of the OECS (Dominica, St. Kitts & Nevis,
Grenada, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent) established a common regulatory framework. The
Eastern Caribbean Telecommunications Authority (ECTEL) – the first regional
telecommunications regulatory authority in the world, was created to facilitate the
harmonization of the regulatory regime. ECTEL embarked on a liberalization process that
passed new telecommunications acts, terminated monopoly rights, and established a
common regulatory framework for the telecommunications sector. ECTEL spent five
years establishing itself; harmonizing legislation in five countries, and supporting and


                                            1
guiding the National Telecommunications Regulatory Commissions (NTRCs) in the
ongoing reform process.
6.     The first step in the reform process led to increased access to telecommunications
services. Growth and competition was promoted by the liberalization process in the
mobile market, as well as competition in other services including fixed and Internet.
Another of ECTEL’s major achievements was the Price Caps Implementation Agreement
signed between October and December 2004 with the incumbent, Cable and Wireless
(C&W). This provided concessions of an estimated US$7.5 million over the first two
years of the Price Caps Plan (PCP).
7.       During the appraisal phase, a number of significant challenges were identified as
barriers to increasing the use of ICT to promote economic development and
diversification. These included high communication costs, partially driven by prevailing
monopolistic behavior in some market segments, such as fixed and leased lines, and
international fiber access. These were hampering the development of investment in ICT
activities such as call centers, data processing, and data storage services, and adversely
affecting telecommunications and financial services that rely on international bandwidth.
These high costs saw a comparatively low Internet usage, especially for advanced
services.
8.      In addition, despite increased cellular service to most of the regional population,
limited access to broadband connectivity was found. Most public institutions such as
schools, libraries, post offices, or health centers had inadequate internet connections. This
was a disadvantage for the institutions and their services; as well as affecting competition
in ICT-enabled services. Inequalities in access to, and use of, broadband services were
effected by the market reality that provision of such services to rural areas is frequently
difficult to sustain financially. And by the OECS governments lagging in the introduction
of broadband applications that would improve the delivery of their own services.
9.       Weaknesses in the legal and regulatory framework further exacerbated
monopolistic behavior and gaps in access. The Telecommunication Act, tariff regulations
and the ECTEL Treaty needed improving and updating. ECTEL and the NTRCs had ill-
defined roles; with both lacking the experience, resources, and training to cope
effectively in a rapidly evolving and competitive environment. Additional regulations
were needed in dispute resolution, consumer protection, market dominance, and
interconnection. Furthermore, a universal access mechanism, combined with government
initiatives in broadband applications was needed to ensure widespread connectivity and
access to advanced ICT services for government, public institutions and communities.
This new Telecommunications and ICT (TICT) Development Project sought to overcome
these remaining gaps and weaknesses; building on the first-stage success of the OECS
Telecommunications Reform Project3).

10.      The rationale for continuing the Bank's involvement in the region was to help
consolidate the reforms implemented under the Bank-financed OECS
Telecommunications Reform Project, and to capitalize on the outcomes of those reforms.
The Bank recognized that the OECS Telecommunications Reform Project had introduced
competition among providers and establishing a functioning and competent regional
telecommunications authority (ECTEL) 4 . ECTEL became the first regional
telecommunications authority. The project increased access to, and reduced the costs of,
telecommunications services by reducing the monopoly of the incumbent C&W and
issued various licenses for fixed and mobile services rates. It had the potential to enhance
the region's competitiveness, promote diversification of the regional economy, and foster
its’ integration into the global market.
11.      Other donors; and regional and international agencies, were looking at how to use
ICT to improve competitiveness and increase economic diversification in the region. The
Bank's involvement was aligned with these initiatives. The UNDP/UNICT Task Force
developed an OECS ICT Strategy that recognized the need to leverage ICT as a catalyst
for competitiveness. This was to be done by addressing issues of connectivity,
affordability, human resources training, and creating a supportive telecommunications, e-
commerce, legal and policy environment. A similar project was the CARICOM Regional
Programming Framework of September 2002, which detailed how ICT offered
significant potential for diversification of the economies of the OECS Member States. A
Special Summit of the OECS Authority (Heads of Government) on the Economy of the
OECS, was held in St. Kitts in October 2002. And the TICT project also complemented
CARICOM and OECS countries’ initiative to implement the Caribbean Knowledge and
Learning Network. This would set up IT centers of excellence within tertiary education
institutions to build a broad base of IT professionals in the Caribbean.
12.    Project development objectives were pursued through the Bank's significant
experience in the sector and knowledge of the region. The Bank’s considerable
experience in telecommunications reform as well as in developing strategies, was utilized
to promote universal access. Attracting and leveraging private participation and
investment in telecommunications infrastructure, as well as on public return on invested
resources through lower telecommunications prices to consumers and businesses, would
be emphasized.
13.     Stakeholders were comforted by the Bank's continued participation in the
development benefits of consolidating past reforms and its provision of added incentives
to undertake new policy and regulatory initiatives. The regional nature of the project was
also directed towards adding support to the collaborative, cross-country approach adopted
by the OECS in the area of telecommunications policy and regulation.

14.     The overall development objective of the project was to improve the access,
quality, and use of telecommunications and ICT services to achieve socio-economic
development in the OECS.
15.      Key indicators of success in achieving the project development objective are:
        Extended access to advanced ICT infrastructure for community facilities; and
        Reduction of leased lines rates, broadband, and mobile tariffs.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification
      16. The PDO remained relevant throughout the project and was not revised. There
      was no formal revision of the KPIs – level 2 restructuring. However, during the mid-
      term review conducted in March 2008, it was agreed that changes in some indicators
      were necessary to better reflect the project objectives and to amend measurement
      capability to monitor some indicators. The PDO indicator ―Number of community
      centers with broadband access‖ presented constraints for measuring public access
      points in community centers due to the lack of resources to track the number of
      community centers providing broadband access. Thus, it was decided that the
      capability of service providers to measure broadband penetration was more feasible
      and it was agreed that penetration index was an effective indicator of the project
      progress. Likewise, the intermediate indicator for component 2 ―Broadband ICT
      access available in 100 community centers across region‖ was modified based on the
      same constraint.
      17. During project implementation, the first indicator related to component 3
      ―Decrease of Broadband services cost by 20% (monthly)‖ required a more narrow
      definition than identified in the PAD, since it was too wide to allow measurement
      over time. In 2008, the indicator was revised to ―Retail Price of Internet Services (per
      Kbps per Month, in US$) and the new baseline became $52 per 256Kbs. In 2009, the
      minimum speed offered by the service providers was upgraded to 1Mbps and the
      project’s new target price was updated for this speed and became $40 per Mbps per
      month. The indicator related to the reduction of ECTEL and NTRCs in annual
      communication cost was dropped as it was concluded that it did not reflect the
      progress of the project implementation towards the achievement of the PDO.
      18. In addition, the following macro-indicators complementary to the M&E
      framework were agreed upon which measure the impact on the Member States based
      on ECTEL´s capability to obtain measurable data that allowed international
      comparability and reflected the impact of the project:
         -       Telecom sector contribution to GDP
         -       Investment in Telecom sector
         -       Direct employment in Telecom sector
         -       Cumulative number of Individual Licenses Issued.
      19. The following table summarizes the modifications introduced in the M&E
      framework.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
20.     The PAD did not explicitly list main beneficiaries under the project. Based on the
characteristics of the project, it could be assumed that the main beneficiaries were the
citizens of the OECS countries, who benefit from easier economic, social and emergency
communication as well as lower access charges at the local level. The local population
was also expected to gain significant economic and social benefits from less expensive
and more widely accessible international connectivity, as suggested by a large Diaspora
population.
21.    The population in general, and by extension, socially marginalized communities,
was expected to gain from the project’s continued expansion of the benefits yielded in a
competitive telecommunications sector. These communities could see the socio-cultural
and political opportunities from having access to ICT networks. The provision of better
access and more affordable services through project implementation would indirectly
have a social impact on better employment opportunities for young graduates. Efforts to
continue to create channels of communication with the civil population?? in relation to
ICT contributing to economic development, was also a planned project undertaking. ???
22.     Member States’ governments were expected to benefit from the support provided
under the various policy and regulatory reforms. In addition, the NTRCs were entitled to
gain institutional strengthening from the establishment of the Universal Service Funds,
through implementation of the Universal Service Pilot Projects and the continuation of
similar projects initiated under the Funds.

1.5 Original Components
23.    The project's objectives were to be achieved through the following components:

Component1 – Support for Legal and Regulatory Reforms (US$840,000)
24.    The objective of this component was to strengthen the national and regional
regulatory frameworks; promote additional competition in the telecommunications sector
and reduce tariffs for consumers and businesses in the region. The goals of the
component were to be achieved through:
     Updating and improving the Telecommunications Act and Regulations;
     Assisting with the establishment of a regional forum for consensus building and
alternative dispute resolution;
     Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) Capacity Building;
     Development of pro-competition policies and procedures;
     Regional collaboration, training, and resource and information sharing.

Component 2 – Universal Access (US$1,270,000)
25.     The objective of this component was to review current universal access policy,
create related guidelines and provide financial support to establish a Universal Service


                                            6
Fund (USF). This component would aid in the implementation of a common universal
access framework and make it operational. Support under this component included:
       Establishment of Universal Service Guidelines (USG);
       Implementation support;
       Support for the Universal Service Fund.

Component 3 – Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) (US$1,030,000)
26.    The objective of this component was to improve growth and competitiveness in
ICT-enabled services through utilization of broadband infrastructure. This component
included:
      Extending the use of broadband applications by governments and the private
sector;
      Implementation of ICT Pilot Projects;
      Establishment of an alternative communication technology for Radio Spectrum
Monitoring System (RSMS).

Component 4 – Project Management (US$245,000)
27.    The objective of this component was to provide support to management and
administration of the overall project. This was to be achieved through:
       Support of the project administration;
       Project audits.

1.6 Revised Components
28.     None of the components were revised.

1.7 Other significant changes
29.    The project closing date was extended twice from the original closing date of
December 31, 2009 to December 31, 2010, and subsequently to December 31, 2011. The
extensions to the closing dates were requested by ECTEL, concurred by the borrowers
and approved by Bank management. Extensions were given to ensure completion of key
project activities, in particular the Universal Service component. Guidelines for the
implementation of this component were required from a consultancy before it could
begin.
30.      In particular, specific conditions had to be in place for the participating OECS
Member States to establish new Universal Service Funds and appoint Universal Service
Fund Administrators in the NTRCs, to co-manage implementation of the Universal
Service Pilot projects. This contributed to delays in project implementation as
institutional challenges encountered by the NTRCs through the creation of the Universal
Service Funds, were further exacerbated by the coordination of efforts needed between
ECTEL and the NTRCs on agreement of the technical elements of the various Universal
Service Pilot projects. This resulted in a request for closing date extensions of the project

                                             7
to facilitate the completion of these components for the successful execution of the
overall project.
31.     At the time of requesting the first extension of the project closing date, in mid-
2009, ECTEL had also requested re-allocation of funds among various categories. This
re-allocation was done to better facilitate the execution of the project. Specifically, the
―Unallocated‖ amount in the original budget was assigned to the ―Consultants‖ category,
primarily to facilitate funding of important consultancies which did not form part of the
original procurement plan, including consultancies aimed at reviewing the Price Cap Plan
and Retail Tariff Regime and the provision of Project Management services during the
proposed extension. However, the reallocation undertaken by the Bank did not exactly
correspond to the request made by ECTEL. Hence, a new re-allocation process was
initiated by the Bank to correct this situation. The re-allocation was also required in order
to meet urgent payments that had become due under category 1, as well as to adjust the
funding under category 3, for credits 4056-GRD, 4057-SLU, and 4058-SV, which had
been mistakenly over drawn OR given overdrafts.
32.    The final requested re-allocations of expenditure amounts among existing
categories are shown in table 1.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
33.   The project addressed key development challenges defined in the World Bank
2001-2005 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for the OECS of:
      Promoting sustainable, private sector-led economic diversification by providing a
       supportive environment for promising, newly emerging service industries; and by
       extension:
      Improving the provision of public services to the population and strengthening the
       broader functioning of the public sector.
34.    In particular, the project outlined the strategy by its development objective of
seeking to improve access and quality and reduce the costs of telecommunication services
for communities and businesses, and foster economic diversification by developing the
ICT services sector and improving the competitiveness of firms in the OECS.
35.     Lessons learned in the previous OECS Telecommunications Reform Project, as
well as those from international best practice and analytical work in the sector, were
reflected in the project design. These included:
      Based on the previous Telecommunications Reform Project, the project was
       proposed to continue with a regional approach for the development of the
       telecommunications and ICT sector. It was necessary to ensure that
       telecommunications policies and regulations were updated and compatible across
       the region. There was a continuing need to take collaborative action to negotiate
       tariff agreements with the incumbent operator, C&W and ensure broadband
       access through the creation of competitive conditions in the market. The project
       took into account the higher than estimated costs incurred in previous negotiations
       with the incumbent operator;
      The project was prepared to continue support for ECTEL and the NTRCs. An
       important lesson from similar projects in the past was that newly created
       regulatory authorities take a long time to consolidate and require continuous
       support in developing their institutional, human, and technical capacity. ECTEL
       in particular, had spent five years establishing itself and required additional
       assistance and resources due to its regional structure and its operation in a rapidly
       evolving market;
      The project design reflected the vital importance of government commitment
       from all countries in moving forward on a regional project. It focused on an area
       in which the governments intended to take action and had requested the Bank's
       assistance. The borrowers were in continuous contact with the Bank and had
       adjusted the project design and costs according to the specific needs compatible
       with each country. As implementation was expected to be slower and weaker in
       the OECS than for the average Bank project, particularly for regional projects,
       estimated dates were set accordingly and most components were basically
       designed as a consolidation of ongoing reforms since the previous project;


                                            10
      The support for the development and implementation of universal access policies
       and regulations as well as setting up a Universal Service Fund to finance universal
       access initiatives incorporated the lessons from the successes in Latin America,
       South Asia and Africa.

Project objective and activities
36.    The overall development objective of the Telecommunications and ICT
Development Project was to improve the access, quality and use of telecommunications
and ICT services to achieve socio-economic development in the OECS. This objective
has been pursued through the implementation of the four components specified in the
PAD.
37.     Project activities were to include mainly consultant services and the procurement
of a limited number of goods. Given its small size (US $2.7 million), the implementation
of the project would have been relatively simple. The only relatively complex project
activity was the Universal Service Fund (US $l.1million), representing about a third of
the total project costs.
Implementation arrangements
38.     When the project was under preparation big efforts were made to ensure
stakeholder involvement. At that time, it was crucial that all ECTEL members recognized
the importance of ICT on economic diversification, educational outcomes, and more
effective government services. The region's international partners had also acknowledged
the role of ICT in improving competitiveness and increasing economic diversification
both within the OECS and the Caribbean.
39.     ECTEL was established as part of the OECS Telecommunications Reform
Project. ECTEL successfully managed the implementation of the first Bank funded
Telecommunications Reform Project. ECTEL was given responsibility for the execution
of the second TICT project.
40.     ECTEL has a well-defined organizational structure and administration. Its
Managing Director reports to a Board of Directors. ECTEL was established by a treaty
that specifically requires that: (a) ECTEL prepare the general budget for each year and
any special budgets for approval by the Board shall then be submitted to the Council for
consideration and adoption; (b) all ECTEL expenses be approved in respect of each
financial year by the Council and shall be chargeable to the general budget or to a special
budget; and (c) the Council appoint an External Auditor to submit it to an annual audit
report which includes a financial and management audit of ECTEL and the ECTEL Fund.
41.    The success of the previous Telecommunications Reform Project encouraged
ECTEL Member States to continue with reforms in the sector, such as universal access
and interconnection frameworks, and to pursue second generation reforms such as
affordable access to broadband connectivity. When the project was being prepared the
Member States showed a strong commitment in establishing and supporting ECTEL.
They also implemented major sector reforms, despite significant pressures from the
incumbent operator, which contributed to the promotion of competition in
telecommunications services and increased private investment in the sector. They also

                                            11
wanted to ensure that all established reforms and institutions were strengthened by
combined assistance through a new project.
42.    The borrowers demonstrated strong project ownership and commitment during
implementation of the previous project, and since the beginning of preparation for the
new project, had shown ownership in its development and been proactive in its
component design and cost estimation. They had also contributed financially by
providing counterpart funding.
43.     The respective NTRCs of the various Member States were also directly involved
in project implementation through their co-management and technical assistance in the
Universal Service projects.
44.      During the project preparation there were no significant environmental issues in
relation to this project. The Bank was not financing civil works, which is an area
normally requiring environmental assessment. The project had been classified category C
for its low impact on the environment.
45.    In the project design, the following critical risks and their mitigation measures

46.     A major risk area was identified in relation to the establishment of the Universal
Service Fund that would provide grants to private sector firms, and concern regarding its
lack of defined mechanisms. However, the risk was considered moderate with the support
being provided under the project component for the development of guidelines which
would require ECTEL, the NTRCs, and Bank approval and ensure that potential risks
were adequately addressed. The preparation of detailed procedures for the management
of the Fund satisfactory to the Bank was a disbursement condition for the financing of
specific projects under the Universal Service Fund. These procedures had defined the
scope of the Universal Service Fund, the selection criteria and processes, the Fund
management, including financing and performance monitoring mechanisms. The exact
demand survey was not required to mitigate insufficient demand risk, however ECTEL
consulted closely with the NTRCS and meetings were also held with service providers to
assess demands which led to selection of Universal Service Projects.
47.    The overall risk of the project was considered moderate; factoring an experienced
and organized implementing entity and the relative simplicity of the activities to be
implemented.

2.2 Implementation
48.     The project was approved by the Board on May 12, 2005 and became effective on
September 30, 2005. The project had five categories and eight loans and credits.
Implementation of the project proceeded reasonably well—except for delays in the
universal access component as explained below--and there were no significant
procurement or project financial management problems. As a result the implementation
progress rating kept a moderately satisfactory trend along the project life until the last
ISR assessment when the overall progress on the project implementation was upgraded to
satisfactory in view of the successful conclusion of all project activities. A mid-term
review was conducted in March 2008, six months later than originally planned. The
project closing date was extended twice by 12 months each, and the M&E framework
was revised to reflect the progress that was being achieved by the project. ECTEL
requested reallocations of funds to ensure the funding of important consultancies, which
did not form part of the original procurement plan. There was also a second reallocation
of funds to correct an error made by the World Bank in processing an earlier reallocation
request. This reallocation was also necessary in order to meet urgent payments that were
due under various categories. The PDO remained unchanged during the complete course
the project. At the beginning of the project, disbursements proceeded at a very low pace
whereas at the mid-stage disbursements were spurred up to finally reach a disbursement
rate of 98% at completion.
49.     The component 1 ―Support for Legal and Regulatory Reforms?, relating to
drafting Telecommunications Acts and Regulations was concluded in October 2010. The
                                              13
final report produced by the approved consultants was submitted to ECTEL for
consultation with stakeholders after which the legislation was submitted to the Council of
Telecommunications Ministers in the ECTEL member states. After the approval by the
Council, a draft Electronic Communications Bill was developed. This was to reform the
legislation relating to telecommunications in the ECTEL Member States by repealing and
replacing the Telecommunications Acts with legislation which given the converged
environment is broader in scope to encompass electronic communications. The Bill is
aimed at allowing a liberalized and non-discriminatory entry into the electronic
communications sector and enabling a robust competitive environment in which there is
fairness, transparency and accountability on the part of the regulators of the sector and is
currently under review for its approval. After the project closing, some workshops are
being organized by ECTEL to finalize the Electronic Communications Bill and it will be
submitted to Member States at the end of 2012 for submission to Parliaments.
50.    With regards to the subcomponents 1.2 Regional Forum for consensus building
and 1.3 Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) Support, a combined consultancy was
undertaken on during 2006 and 2007 that produced a Procedures & Training Manual for
ADR in the Telecommunications Sector in ECTEL Member States was prepared
covering (i) Mediation; (ii)Tribunals (iii) Arbitration; and (iv) Conciliation. After this
consultancy, commissioners of the various NTRCs are now certified to develop and
implement ADR procedures for handling specific anticipated areas of dispute in the
Member States.
51.     Under subcomponent 1.4, a consultancy on Development of Pro-competition
Policies and Procedures (Interconnection Cost Methodology to Enhance Competition)
was undertaken that commenced in November 2005 and concluded in November 2006
and plus a supplementary consultancy that was required and in 2007 to provide technical
assistance on the development of Cost Models for Fixed and Mobile Interconnection
Services. These consultancies resulted in the development of Interconnection Regulations
as well as Whole Sale Tariffs Regulations that are currently implemented in the Member
States. Interconnection rates were enacted, following the cost methodology developed
through this consultancy.
52.     The component 2 “Universal Access? aimed at supporting USFs (Universal
Service Funds) Implementation by providing advice to ECTEL for the implementation of
the Universal Service component. Training workshops were held to provide guidelines
for procedures and processes to ECTEL and NTRC staff for the successful
implementation of USFs.
53.     The above component included the implementation of Universal Service projects
in each of the OECS Member States with a total of US$1 million in lending. Despite of
ECTEL’s efforts for the timely completion of projects for this component, it encountered
some delays. The delays were due to a combination of two key factors: limited private
sector interest and challenges in defining the projects for some of the ECTEL member
states. Limited private sector interest was evidenced by the fact that the bidding process
in Dominica had to be repeated due to non-receipt of bids, and both the Dominica and
Grenada bidding processes needed several deadline extensions in order to try to attract
more bidders. In addition, capacity issues at the NTRC level constrained the speed at
which the projects have been designed, notably for the other three countries.

                                            14
54.     Dominica: The Universal Service project for Dominica was originally aimed at
the establishment of Community Access Points (CAPs) to provide internet and related
services to the public in communities where such services were absent or lacking. Two
unsuccessful rounds of bidding were carried out between October 2010 and June 2011. In
the second round, only one bidder submitted a bid after extending the closing date twice.
The bid was reviewed by the ECTEL evaluation committee and it was confirmed that the
bidder did not have the financial capacity to undertake the project. ECTEL therefore
submitted a Bid Evaluation Report to the World Bank in July 2011, recommending the
rejection of the bid. The World Bank issued a no-objection to the disqualification of the
bid. After the challenges of the CAPs Project, NTRC-Dominica proposed an alternative
Universal Service Project to Provide Broadband Internet Services to the public in
designated geographic locations in the Commonwealth of Dominica. The Bank issued the
no objection to the bidding documents in August 2011. Despite the high interest shown in
the project by a number of bidders, only one bid was submitted by the closing date, which
was deemed acceptable and a contract was signed in early December 2011.
55.     Grenada: The Universal Service project for Grenada was aimed at providing
internet and related services to the public in designated geographic areas via CAPs. The
Bid Evaluation Report was submitted to the World Bank in June 2011 and the no-
objection to the Bid Evaluation Report and award of contract to the top-ranked bidder
was given by the World Bank shortly thereafter. Implementation progressed swiftly and
all CAPs were completed prior to the closing date of the TICT Project.
56.     St. Kitts and Nevis: The Universal Service project for St. Kitts and Nevis was
aimed at establishing a wireless network to provide connectivity to schools in support of
a parallel initiative of the Government of St. Kitts and Nevis that involved the provision
of laptops to students, the EduNet Project. Following the Bank’s approval of three (3)
extensions to the deadline for submission of bids and two (2) amendments to the bidding
documents, two bidders submitted the bids. Both bids were found to be substantially
responsive. ECTEL subsequently completed the evaluation report in November 2011
with the input from the NTRC-St. Kitts and Nevis. However, due to changes in
Government counterparts within the Government of St. Kitts and Nevis, contract
negotiations with the winning bidder were concluded in December and the supply of
equipment completed in time for project closing. It must be noted that, due to the nature
of the project, the contracting arrangements were structured as two contracts: a supply
and installation contract to be co-financed by the TICT Project and the NTRC, and a
maintenance contract to be financed by the NTRC exclusively.
57.     Saint Lucia: The Universal Service Project for St. Lucia sought to address the ICT
requirements of individuals with special needs. ECTEL had extensive consultations with
leading institutions regarding the requirements of persons with special needs, such us
blind students, children with hearing impairments and special education needs. The
project proposal was prepared and submitted to the World Bank in September 2011. The
project proposal was approved, and Invitations to Quote (ITQs) for the procurement of
the hardware and software were subsequently circulated to local firms. In October 2011,
following evaluation of the quotations received, Purchase Orders were issued to two (2)
firms, one (1) for hardware and one (1) for software. Deliveries of the software and
hardware took place in December, ahead of project closing date.

                                           15
58.    St. Vincent and the Grenadines: The Universal Service project for St. Vincent and
the Grenadines was aimed at providing improved VHF coverage for maritime emergency
communication systems among the islands. Following various amendments and an
extension of the bid submission closing date, only one bid was received by ECTEL in
July 2011. Given the higher than expected value of the contract, to be co-financed by the
TICT Project and the NTRC-St. Vincent, the NTRC engaged in a negotiation with the
Ministry of Finance to obtain a special waiver of import duties, which was approved by
Cabinet. The contract was signed shortly thereafter and the supply of equipment funded
by the project was fully delivered prior to the closing date. It must be noted that, like in
the case of St. Kitts and Nevis, due to the nature of the project, the contracting
arrangements were structured as two contracts: a supply and installation contract to be
co-financed by the TICT Project and the NTRC, and a maintenance contract to be
financed by the NTRC exclusively.
59.     The component 3, “Information and Communication Technologies?, was aimed
at providing technical assistance support for ICT Pilot Projects in each ECTEL Member
State. The first activity carried out under this component was the consultancy on
Alternative Communication Technologies for Radio Spectrum Monitoring in ECTEL
Member States that concluded in June 2007. A recommendation was made in the
Consultant Final Report on a voice/data communication solution to link ECTEL and the
NTRCs, to replace the existing data communication system linking these entities. A
second consultancy concluded in 2008 with the Extending the Use of Broadband
applications by Governments and the Private Sector that developed a National ICT Plan
for ECTEL Member States, which was submitted to all Member States for adoption. A
last consultancy provided support to ECTEL in the monitoring and management of the
ICT Pilot Projects.
60.      The Dominica ICT pilot, with the Ministry of Education as its counterpart,
involved ―live digital classroom‖ lessons as well as related equipment. The live streaming
of certain classes and the recording of lessons was completed in December 2010 being
now available under the portal and facilitating students and teachers accessing the school
contents via Internet. The Grenada ICT pilot involved a ―lego mindstorm‖ as a tool for
ICT in Education. This project engaged students in selected schools in the design and
construction of robots using the LEGO MINDSTORMS Robotics Invention System. The
St. Kitts ICT pilot involved the establishment of a Community Technology Centre at the
Dieppe Bay Primary School in St. Kitts and the conduct of an initial set of training
activities within the centre. During implementation this project faced some procurement
delays due to the need to make a second bidding round resulting from the absence of bids
submitted at the first invitation. The St. Lucia ICT pilot comprised the equipment for a
community tele-center, specifically a set of desktop computers along with furniture and
accessories for a community-based resource centre in the town of Soufriere. The formal
handover of the equipment was delayed, due to the fact that the building that was
designated to house the equipment was damaged by Hurricane Tomas. ECTEL worked
with the National ICT Unit to agree on a formal handover of the equipment, which took
place at the end of 2011, once the repairs to the building were completed. The center was
officially inaugurated in April 2012. The St. Vincent and Grenadines pilot that was
completed in November 2011 after three bidding rounds included the piloting of a digital
portal to facilitate communication between secondary schools and provided a
                                            16
communication tool to provide remote access to lessons for students. Given the fact that
the above mentioned consultancies needed to take place prior to the implementation of
the ICT pilots, these projects were completed at the very final stage of the project. This
circumstance has affected the capability of showing a more comprehensive analysis of a
longer impact over time.
61.     Under the component 4, “Project Management?, a project manager and a project
officer were hired and supported the project administration capacity within ECTEL. The
financial audits were conducted each year from inception to completion.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
62.     The project consisted of four components and a total of 14 indicators were
identified to monitor all components of the project. The indicators were grouped by
component to ensure that all aspects of the project were monitored.
63.     Data used to calculate the indicators was collected from telecommunications
service providers using questionnaires and from publicly available information published
by providers. The data received from providers was reviewed using quality control
measures including manual audits of questionnaires, period over period comparison of
data, and comparison of data to publically available. Data was also collected through
ECCB statistical database, which in 2010 carried out an exercise of rebasing National
Accounts and CPI affecting some of the indicators such as ICT contribution to GDP and
Internet penetration.
64.     The progress of the project was monitored on an ongoing basis and the status of
the telecommunications sector in the ECTEL Member States was also assessed as part of
that process and recorded in supervision mission aide memories. Changes in the sector
and the needs of the ECTEL Member States was used to inform decision making and
changes to resource allocation during the course of the project.
65.    It is important to mention that most of the data collected and used to monitor the
outputs of the project is currently open and available on the ECTEL website, including
the macroeconomic indexes for international comparison that were introduced after the
mid-term review.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Safeguard Policy Issues
66. There were no safeguard policies applicable to the project.
Fiduciary
67.      ECTEL had procurement and financial management responsibility for the project.
Its financial management was found to be globally satisfactory, but for ECTEL to meet
its statutory requirements in the preparation of its own financial statements, as well as the
needs of the new project, adaptation to the current context was necessary. Since ECTEL's
financial management system was shaped around the needs of the OECS
Telecommunications Reform Project, it was essential for it to be elevated to a level to
meet both ECTEL's statutory requirement and ensure the project's financial management.

                                             17
ECTEL had already implemented measures to that effect, including customizing its
financial management software and preparing a new financial policy and procedures
manual, which was approved by its Board. ECTEL hired a project manager with broad
World Bank procurement experience. During supervision missions the Bank organized a
number of procurement workshops and trained ECTEL staff on fiduciary issues by giving
them hands on training. Initially the project implementation was very slow even though
first extension was about to complete the disbursement was very low due to a number of
procurement issues. The second extension was sought through the RVP office with the
goal to complete all Universal Service Funds Components. The Bank and borrower
teams worked on day to day action plan basis. It was challenging as no bids or only one
bid have been submitted by the local providers – no international providers had shown
interest. The Bank team carried out workshops on procurement and Business Outreach
resulting increasing interest in providers to participate in the bidding process. This fact
enhanced disbursement to reach the final 98% rate.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
68.      The various reforms initiated and developed under the project will continue to be
sustained. For instance, the draft Telecommunication act that considered the Electronic
Communication Bill is ready and currently available for public comments, discussions
and recommendations and forms part of a wide range of awareness and consultative
activities in all the ECTEL Member States. ECTEL will establish a discussion Board to
facilitate comments, ideas and suggestions prior to obtaining the requisite member states
approval.
69.    ECTEL will continue one of its primary functions of providing legal and technical
guidance to the NTRCs regarding the implementation of Universal Service. ECTEL will
also keep extending professional advice to the NTRCs on the processing of applications
and their legal ramifications and economic impacts.
70.    The NTRCs of Dominica and St. Kitts and Nevis have signed separate Service
Agreements with the Contractors who implemented the first phase of their Universal
Service Projects, to implement the second phase of the projects relating to the operation
and maintenance of the services established in these two Member States. Whilst
ECTEL’s obligations regarding the implementation of these Universal Service Pilot
Projects have been fulfilled, ECTEL will support the NTRCs in the implementation of the
Service Agreements.
71.    For the USF project undertaken in St. Vincent and the Grenadines through which
a communications tool to provide for remote instruction of students was developed, the
Ministry of Education of the St. Vincent and the Grenadines has committed to ensure the
continuity of the project.
72.     The St. Lucia Universal Service Project included exclusively the procurement of
equipment and software for institutions catering to special needs individuals, and was
completed upon delivery of the items to the agencies. Further operational maintenance
for the equipment and software will be provided by each of the beneficiary institutions.
73.    In order to maintain Grenada´s Universal Service Project, ECTEL has signed a
Service Agreement for a period of two (2) years from January 01, 2012 to December 31,

                                            18
2013 with the operator who implemented the first component –establishment of the
Community Access Points (CAPs) facilities in targeted rural areas in Grenada. Under the
agreement, the operator will provide and maintain the services in the CAPs. ECTEL has
designated NTRC-Grenada as the Coordinator for activities and deliverables and as
Verification Agent responsible for the evaluation and certification of Contractor
compliance under this Agreement, as well as for approving the transfer of ownership of
equipment to the Contractor in the two-year period.
74.    The Universal Service Funds established within the NTRCs of the Member States
will continue to be supported and sustained as a result of the Universal Service Fund
Regulations and Guidelines developed under the project.
75.    For the ICT Pilot Project, the Ministry of Education from each Member State
country has committed to deploy the resources to operate and maintain the equipment
provided by this component.
76.      In addition, the upcoming World Bank funded project CARCIP will serve also as
a follow-up project based on that fact that it is designed to assist the Governments of the
Caribbean in increasing access to and usage of broadband communications infrastructure,
overall reducing the cost of ICT services, and thereby facilitating the development of a
wide range of ICT applications that promote social and economic development in the
region. CARCIP will provide further solutions for countries to benefit from the
development and transformational potential of ICT. First, CARCIP aims at providing
opportunities for the CARIFORUM region to bridge the remaining gaps in regional and
domestic broadband communication infrastructure, including submarine cable
infrastructure and landing stations, domestic backbone networks and cross-border links
and, national and regional internet exchange points (IXPs). Second, CARCIP aims to
create an enabling environment that leverages this regional and domestic infrastructure to
foster employment and economic growth. Finally, CARCIP aims to support institutional
development and capacity building that enhances the effectiveness of the regional
institutional ICT framework. The group of countries includes Grenada, St. Vincent and
the Grenadines and St. Lucia.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
77.     This project’s objectives remain fully relevant to priorities of the five
participating countries and the OECS region and consistent with the Regional Partnership
Strategy for OECS, 2010-14: Enhancing Competitiveness and Stimulating Sustainable
Growth by supporting the development of possible new sources of growth such as
offshore education, health and wellness tourism and high–end information and
communications technology (ICT); and expanding existing critical sectors such as
tourism, agriculture, creative industries, and manufacturing. More specifically, the project
design and implementation fitted into that strategy by seeking to improve access and
quality and reduce the cost of telecommunication services for communities, and foster
economic diversification by developing the ICT service sector and improving the
competitiveness in the OECS.


                                            19
78.    The OECS recognized in its development strategy that information and
communication technologies (ICT) offered significant opportunities to achieve greater
economic growth and diversification and contributed to poverty reduction. The
governments of the OECS placed the reform of their telecommunications sectors at the
center of their development strategy to diversify their economies, enhance export
competitiveness, and increase economic growth.
79.    Project implementation permitted stakeholders to acquire a deeper understanding
and knowledge of the sector. It revealed the current capacities of the existing providers to
extend Universal Service. The project also provided the opportunity to test the existing
regulatory provisions in the telecommunications sector.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
80.     The overall development objective of the project to improve the access, quality,
and use of telecommunications and ICT services to achieve socio-economic development
in the OECS was accomplished by the implementing agency, ECTEL; reflected in the
continued advancements in policy and regulatory reforms. Key indicators of success in
achieving the project development objective of extended access to advanced ICT
infrastructure for community facilities and reduction in leased lines rates, broadband, and
mobile tariffs were reflected in various project accomplishments.
81.     Improved access to ICT services has been achieved by the project through the
establishment of the various USFs and implementation of Universal Service projects and
ICT pilot projects in each Member State. The provision of broadband Internet facilities
and network and ICT equipment and software has promoted the use of ICTs among rural
underserved communities, persons with special needs as in the case of Saint Lucia and
contributed to improve communications, collaboration, e-learning and research for
students.
82.     Achievements were also reflected in the higher use of ICTs across the
participating countries, such as mobile and Internet services. Since the project started,
mobile Internet penetration has increased significantly from 7.6% to 14%, however as of
the end of 2011 it was one percentage point below the 15% pursued target stated by the
PDO indicator. In the last years, the percentage of population subscribed to fixed
broadband Internet has steadily grown more than 10%5 from 2005 to 2010. St. Kitts and
Nevis being the countries with the strongest growth during that period, reaching a 28%
fixed broadband Internet rate per 100 people as of 2010.
83.     The updated legislation was drafted to guide future ICT regulation in the Member
States. Universal Service Regulations and Guidelines were developed; resulting in the
establishment of Universal Service Funds and initiation of Universal Service Projects in
all Member States. A significant project contribution was the enactment of an
Interconnection pricing calculation model, which guides consumer rates; a direct result
from the development of the cost models. The success realized with the interconnection

model was followed by the new Price Cap Plan, which led to reduce fixed-to-mobile rates
by 40%. Based on the above achievements, efforts were addressed towards mobile
termination rates even though initially not planned in the project design. Mobile
termination rates performance showed another development attributable to the project;
while not captured as a project indicator, there was an overall 60% reduction in mobile
termination rates from US$ 0.23 to 0.09. These results have allowed consumers to benefit
from access to telecommunications services at more affordable rates.
84.     Other improvements in the telecommunications sector in the Member States are
reflected in monthly rates for domestic and international leased lines that have decreased
over 56% and 78% respectively. Mobile retail rates have been reduced by 67% and
Internet rates at the speed of 1 Mbps in two years from 2009 to 2011 have dropped by
28%. In addition, reduction in telecommunications rates and prices are also expected to
continue and consequently citizens across Member States will continue gaining from
access to telecommunications services at lower cost.
85.     These improvements have driven the countries towards bridging the gap in terms
of the use of ICT’s as measured by the number of fixed broadband internet subscribers
per 100 people. In average, the Member States are ranked below high income non OECS
countries, 14.1% and 14.4 respectively as of 2010. Likewise, in comparison with other
Caribbean countries and also across the Latin America and Caribbean the progress made
has also been significant as shown in the following chart.

86.      As a matter of fact, the trend depicted on the charts above was initiated before the
implementation of TICT project and the achievements done have been also led by the
preceding ICT project, which for instance contributed to the creation of ECTEL. This
illustrates the benefits of a long-term ICT strategy defined by the countries and supported
by the Bank.
87.     The project has made a substantial contribution to the development of the ICT
sector in the ECTEL Member States, through the development of model ICT policies and
plans for the Member States. To date, the project has made advances in
telecommunications regulation in the ECTEL Member States and in the development of
ECTEL and the National Telecommunications Regulatory Commissions (NTRCs) of the
ECTEL Member States. The telecommunications sector contribution to GDP has shown
an increase in the ECTEL Member States, despite the fact that a decline was forecasted
due to economic slowdown trend; currently the sector contribution to GDP increased
from 10% to 11.2%. Furthermore, while there was overall slowdown in economic growth
in the sector; direct employment from the sector has increased by 11%. (Juan can you
please add something here)
88.     As a direct result of the implementation of the project, regional collaboration,
resource and information sharing has also increased through the organization of several
training programs and workshops. Institutional capacity building for ministers, board
members, commissioners, ECTEL and NTRC staff in telecommunications regulation has
been enhanced.
89.     A more detailed analysis of the project development objective achievements and
its outputs and outcomes are illustrated in Annex 2.

3.3 Efficiency
90.     The components implemented under this project related to guidelines, capacity
building or advice for ICT policy reforms, do not imply quantitative projections of rates
of return and were not developed during project preparation. However, as mentioned in
previous sections, there were economic gains from the implementation of the project. A

                                             22
recent assessment by ECTEL calculates that customer savings, from fall in rates for
mobile to fixed calls during the project life, have surpassed USD 5 million from 2005 to
2011. Furthermore, OECS Member States customers have saved almost USD 3 million
from the reduction in rates for fixed to mobile calls. These savings are calculated based
on the latest traffic data available as at March 2011. In addition, broadband subscribers
across the five countries have benefited from a drop in the monthly rates they pay to the
service provider and have gained from a more affordable access to Internet. The
estimated consumer savings, accounts for more than USD 4 million resulting from lower
Internet prices since 2006 to the end of 2011. For more information please see Annex 3.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory
91.     The project outcome is rated satisfactory. The rating is based on the achievements
and the impact leveraging a US$2.7 million loan and credit to support the development of
the telecommunication and ICT sector within the Member States. The population in the
Member States has benefited with the move from poor access to better access in ICTs at a
more affordable cost, and this has affected the increasing ICT tools usage leading the
OECS countries towards reducing the gap compared to higher income economies.
Simultaneously, the rating reflects the relevance of the project objective to the priorities
of the five participating countries by promoting competitiveness through improving
access and quality and reducing the cost of telecommunication services for communities.
The overall satisfactory outcome rating reflects the fact that almost all of the project's
results targets were met or surpassed. The PDO indicator Usage of Broadband Service
improved greatly from its low baseline value even though it fell just slightly short of the
target (13.77 users per 100 vs. target of 15, from a baseline of 2.9). Only one
intermediate indicator, on reduced international rates, was not achieved despite the
improved regulatory framework.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
92.     The project did not specifically set any parameters or establish indicators to
evaluate correlation between the achievement of various project objectives and their
poverty reduction impacts. However, inferences can be made regarding the focus and
outcomes of some of the Universal Service Pilot Projects in particular. The Universal
Service Pilot Project for Grenada established Internet and related services in rural or
underserved communities (normally considered poor areas), by way of Community
Access Points (CAPs); making ICT services accessible where previously unavailable or
limited. The Universal Service Pilot Projects for St. Lucia targeted the ICT needs of
persons with disabilities (also a population considered as underserved in the provision of
universal access). The social implications of the outcomes of the above mentioned
projects are considerable.
93.    Social developments realized by the project include the benefits of lower access
charges that populations have gained from at the local level. Project countries with a
large Diaspora population also continue to obtain significant social benefits from less
expensive and more widely accessible international connectivity.

                                              23
94.    The general population, and by extension socially marginalized communities,
continue to gain from the project’s sustained expansion of the benefits of a competitive
telecommunications sector.
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
95.     Introduction of Universal Service regulations and guidelines, led to the
establishment of Universal Service Funds within the various NTRCs of the Member
States, and the introduction of Universal Service programs in the countries resulted in the
strengthening of the NTRCs to deal with Universal Service.
96.   The Draft Electronic Communications Act will result in the New
Telecommunication Bill that will imply changes to the regulation of ICTs and related
changes to the structures of NTRCs and ECTEL. This will create an open competitive
communications environment and establish fair, independent and transparent regulator.
97.    The various training programs implemented under the project in the area of
telecommunications regulation contributed to institutional strengthening of ECTEL, the
NTRCs and other national agencies/institutions. For instance, the Spectrum team from
ECTEL gained from reinforcing the skills and capabilities to monitor spectrum using
hand-held devices.
(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
98.    The project’s implementation affected ECTEL’s operations in that it absorbed
more of ECTEL’s resources than intended. ECTEL, as implementing agency, had to
expend more of its resources than anticipated, such as Administrative and Accounting
services, during project implementation. As a result, ECTEL`s team experienced a highly
overloaded working period.
99.      The Project Manager’s level of project information and experience was extended
to all professional units in ECTEL. The project management expertise enhanced the daily
core functions of the professionals attached to these units. ECTEL gained greater
understanding of World Bank procedures and guidelines in the execution of the project.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
100.   No beneficiary survey or stakeholder workshops were held.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Low or Negligible.
101. The assessment of risk to development outcome is low. On the one hand, ECTEL
is functioning effectively, and has established itself as a significant force in the sector,
advising member countries on issues concerning the reform of the Telecommunication
Act, Universal Service Funds implementation and interconnection cost methodology.
Having achieved the benefits detailed above, it is very unlikely that the OECS would
backtrack on the reforms realized thus far. Furthermore, the progress of the sector has
brought lower prices and improved service to tens of thousands of customers, who are
unlikely to tolerate a deterioration of service. OECS governments strongly support
telecommunications reforms and have expressed their commitment to maintain the USF
programs and the pilot project implemented.

                                            24
5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory
102. The Bank’s performance ensuring quality at entry was satisfactory. A proven
success formula from the previous project with focus on one implementation agency
coordinating five countries was applied. Lessons from the previous operations, including
counterpart commitment and ownership as well as a strong execution unit were
confirmed.
(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory
103. Supervision of the project was thorough, with seasoned ICT experienced task
team leader and a supervision team with broad experience in IT procurement, and other
ICT issues. Bank management also viewed supervision satisfactory as reflected on ISR
comments. Supervision missions were conducted in a regular basis with strong dialogue
with ECTEL and the government. The supervision mission reports were timely,
comprehensive and candid. Fiduciary standards were met. Site visits were timely and
ISRs informative.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
104. The services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry and supported
effective implementation through appropriate supervision (including promoting adequate
transition arrangements for regular operation of supported activities after the loan/credit
closing) towards the achievement of development outcomes.
105. The Bank prepared and supervised a successful operation in close collaboration
with a long-standing partner. Implementation challenges were proactively addressed and
the opportunities for further progress were jointly identified and supported by extending
the closing date to accommodate a successful achievement of the project objectives
including the challenging USF component. Bank support helped take the
telecommunication sector in OECS countries to a point of broad development.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
106. Given the nature of the project where five member countries were involved, each
country’s performance was overall positive. The evidence that shows Governments’
satisfactory performance can be found in their support to overcome the challenges
encountered in finding adequate ICT providers and vendors. There was a weak response
to the competitive procurement process, when only one or two bidders responded to most
of the bidding processes announced by ECTEL. Respective state member countries along
with a Bank supervision team, organized a number of procurement and Business
Outreach seminars that raised the interest of the providers and vendors to participate in
the project. The Governments from the participating countries reacted appropriately to

                                            25
project procedures when, for example, the project went through extending the closing
date, and a reallocation of funds.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
107. ECTEL had a good experience from the previous project Telecommunication
Reform, which was completed in December 2004. For the TICT project, ECTEL selected
a consultant as project manager and procurement expert, who had appropriate experience
in managing the Bank-funded projects. The outstanding financial and operations teams
also contributed to the performance attained by ECTEL.
108. Special mention must be made of the performance of ECTEL’s management
team, who worked closely with the Bank team, understanding the parameters the Bank
was working within, as well as those of the Member States. The management team could
solve unexpected issues which ensured the timely implementation of the project.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
109. ECTEL has successfully implemented a complex project spread over five
countries. ECTEL management successfully worked with each Member country and led
the project progress towards achieving the project development objective. ECTEL
completed USF component despite the challenges faced. On the other hand, the
Governments of the five Member States supported the progress of the project in
accordance with the project expected and unexpected needs.

6. Lessons Learned
110. Coordination of a regional project is complex and stretches very thinly in terms of
both project management and supervision resources. Five set of Ministers of
Communications, and Prime Ministers, NTRCs and ECTEL were involved at critical
junctures in project implementation. Even with the best intentions, the coordination to
obtain signatures from all member countries on any change such as category reallocation
or extension of the closing dates was a hard task. As a suggestion for future regional
projects, resources to be deployed to project coordination would require to be full-fledged
defined.
111. A consideration for other ICT project in small countries it that it could be
beneficial to share the fixed costs of ICT development and policy and regulation projects.
Normal practice worldwide is for telecommunications policy and regulatory issues to be
addressed on a national basis. A regional approach was seen as viable since the
telecommunications issues facing each island were similar.
112. The bidding document created by ECTEL with the help of the Bank procurement
team for each Member State –Internet and related service to the public via Community
Access Points (CAPs) in designated geographic locations in Grenada-, could serve as a
best practice for future Universal Service projects where CAPs are to be installed. USF
bidding documents were a recurring challenge even though ECTEL recruited a highly
qualified consultant to develop the bidding document for the Universal Service project.

                                            26
The bidding document and its approach were unique in a sense that it was a hybrid PPP
and conventional procurement. Bank procurement experts helped the consultant to
develop the appropriate document for the Member States.
113. A useful tool that could help future projects in countries with little experience in
World Bank competitive bidding processes is the organization of business outreach
workshops that provide with the knowledge to service providers. These workshops were
found particularly helpful when dealing with ICT procurement processes.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies
114. Some of the comments raised by ECTEL during the ICR mission from the project
implementation include:
      Building new relationships simultaneously with project implementation can be
       counterproductive to project execution: With the ICT Pilot Projects, ECTEL had
       to work with national agencies/institutions with which it had no traditional
       relationship, and much time had to be spent in building relationships in order to
       get projects started and implemented;
      Institutional challenges were faced in the implementation of the Universal
       Service Project components across the Member States. Delays were experienced
       in getting information and feedback from the NTRCs and other national agencies
       to ECTEL, as related to the identification of suitable Universal Service Projects
       for implementation. Further setbacks were faced with the institutions defining the
       design and technical elements of the projects selected. The institutions also had
       limited experience in bidding processes. It was noted however, that the
       development of projects and bidding was new to the national institutions
       (NTRCs) and so they had to go through a learning process;
      Greater emphasis on institutional building can lead to more efficient
       implementation and sustainability of projects: At project inception the regulatory
       system was in its early stages, and the NTRCs in particular needed assistance in
       areas such as in the provision of Universal Service, the establishment of the
       Universal Service Funds and training for Universal Service Fund Administrators,
       which would also set the foundation for sustainability of these components. Due
       to their limited knowledge and inexperience in these areas, the NTRC’s faced
       issues with project deliverables as discussed in the previous point;
       Bidder inexperience with procurement processes affect project progress: The
       implementation of the Universal Service and ICT Project components were
       hindered by various issues experienced with the bidding processes. Generally,
       poor response to invitations to bid on the various projects as well as bidder
       weaknesses in submitting substantially responsive bids to bidding invitations,
       created significant project delays and issues. Frequently, bidder responses to
       bidding invitations were low, and in most instances where bids were submitted,
       the bids lacked the requisite information and documentation to constitute a
       substantially responsive bid;


                                           27
      A lot of efforts have been employed to handle the many
       components/subcomponents of the project: The project had a number of
       components and subcomponents; each encompassing a good or service
       procurement element. In view of the issues with procurement processes discussed
       above, this also created delays in the project outputs. Especially if bearing in mind
       that ECTEL, as the implementing agency, is a small organization with limited
       resources;
      Dependent or correlated project activities/components need adequate time for
       effective implementation: In situations where the implementation of a project
       activity or component is dependent on the outcome of another, initiating the
       project activity/component within reasonable time will allow for greater
       achievement of project objectives. Implementation of the Universal Service
       Projects in the ECTEL Member States first required the establishment of
       Universal Service Funds in each of the Member States, and appointment of a
       Universal Service Fund Administrator to manage the funds. These preceding
       activities suffered setbacks, as the time required to do so, in a region with
       generally low capacity, created delays which the project design did not cater for.
       Notwithstanding the project extensions granted primarily to address completion of
       the Universal Service and ICT Pilot Project components, the Universal Service
       Pilot Projects still experienced setbacks. Earlier implementation of this
       component or additional time permitted to fully achieve the objectives of the
       Universal Service Pilot Projects would have realized greater success;
      Projects should make provision for sufficient resources for implementation
       before commencement: The project design should ensure that adequate resources
       are allocated to the implementing agency prior to project implementation. ECTEL,
       as implementing agency, had to draw on its own resources to provide
       administrative and other support services (e.g. Accounting), during project
       implementation, which was not accounted for in the design of the project. During
       ICR mission ECTEL also expressed that the resources allocated to the project
       were not sufficient to effectively meet the project objectives for all components
       incorporating the needs of the five (5) participating ECTEL Member States.
       Regional projects require many resources for achievement of project objectives.
      Project design clung to typical models that focus on infrastructure development,
       by way of network expansion, to improve access, quality and use of
       telecommunications and ICT services. It was perceived that greater success would
       be achieved through the concentration of efforts instead on redefining basic
       standards and services, rather than infrastructure, which would create the needed
       flexibility for all types of agencies to offer innovative services relating to the
       advancement of telecommunications.

(b) Other partners and stakeholders
115. As part of the USF component, equipment and software were provided to schools
and centers for people with special needs in Saint Lucia. One of the beneficiary schools
was Lady Gordon Opportunity Center, whose principal made the following comments
during Bank ICR mission visit.

                                            28
116. The school has 75 students, and aims to support student independence; help
students take care of themselves and build its students future employability. Computers
help the attention and confidence of students with special needs, and the school wants to
further promote ICT. The principal talked about the challenges facing children with
special needs, and said how much the school had appreciated the project supporting the
training process of the students. She said ICT teaching tools get students excited about
learning. This project provided the school with specialized teaching software, and
headphones, a projector and printers. Ultimately, based on the students’ excellent
progress, she said the school would like a computer in each classroom to allow every
student access. Currently the school has the existing equipment in the computer lab and
library. She was concerned about the lack of computers in the school, noting that another
donor program had failed to provide promised computer equipment. The principal said
the effects of the ICT software were positive, as evidenced by teachers bringing their own
lap tops to allow the students more time with the project-provided software. Asked if the
project had provided sufficient resources, the principal acknowledged that while the need
was huge, the project has helped and confirmed that it is sufficient for now.
117. The USF component provided equipment and software to set up an Information
Technology Center at Saint Lucia Blind Welfare Association. These included ten
computers, scanners and Job Access With Speed (JAWS) - software specifically designed
for blind people During the ICR mission, the Bank team met with the school principal,
the coordinator and the computer professor, who raised the following points:
118. They talked about the benefits of adapted ICTs for its’ 90 blind students. They
explained that the courses are divided into three (3) different levels and the professor
showed the team how the JAWS software works. Training blind students in computer
skills was of the upmost relevance, they said, as it helped reinforce students’ learning
processes, and in most cases was more effective than teaching Braille. They emphasized
that JAWS software increases blind students’ ability to attend, and study at secondary
school, and university. It helps them follow the normal teaching speed of the class, and
allows them to take notes properly. Thanks to the JAWS system, blind students also have
access to global information through the Internet and to social media tools. This increases
their interest in ICT skills, and is a fun activity, which helps maintain their enrollment at
the school.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

The following economic analysis is based on the assumption that customers of telecom
services have attained a year-to-year surplus. It also takes into account the yearly (March
to March) reduction in rates and the Internet traffic being consumed by users.

Figures for traffic data and price changes are for period ended March 2011 - the latest
data available.

Please note that in 2008 the download speed offered for the basic ADSL package was
increased to 1 Mbps. From 2008 to 2011, download speed for basic broadband service
was 1 Mbps. In addition, the rate for the basic package was reduced resulting in a
significant increase in value to customers. In estimating the customer savings the base
rate of 52USD was maintained as the same customers who would have subscribed to the
256 Kbps package in 2007 were upgraded to the 1Mbps package in 2008, so that
customer would have realized significant savings from the upgrade.

The ICR team reviewed the initial procurement plan prepared at the time of appraisal and
the final plan prior to project closing. It found that most of the activities fell behind up to
a year or more due to the reasons indicated in the above chapters. However, the majority
of categories remained steady even though no major revision in the components was
envisaged during the restructuring of the project.
