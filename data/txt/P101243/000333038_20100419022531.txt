F. Results Framework Analysis

Program Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The PEDPC IV is based on the following three pillars and PDOs:


                                                ii
  (A) Enhance fiscal sustainability and improve the fiduciary environment to: (i) ensure
that public expenditure continues to be increased for education at both provincial and
district levels in accordance with sector needs; (ii) strengthen the districts# financing
capacity and ensure that adequate resources are transferred to districts to meet education
needs; (iii) increase transparency of financial management and procurement processes
and practices; and (iv) strengthen provincial and district capacities to monitor financial
flows.

  (B) Increase equitable access to education and improve quality and relevance of
education. This forms the core reform agenda. Access agenda focuses on programs to: (i)
increase participation, retention and completion rates, especially for girls; and (ii)
encourage the participation of private sector. The quality agenda seeks to: (i) improve
school performance and student learning outcomes; and (ii) improve quality of learning
through better teaching practices, better textbooks and a credible examination system.

   (C) Improve public education sector governance and management to: (i) strengthen
sector planning and policy development capacity of the provincial education department;
(ii) strengthen district education departments# management and monitoring capacity; (iii)
strengthen monitoring and evaluation to gauge education sector performance; and (iv)
enhance school based management, and monitoring of school performance by
communities.

1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal
At the time of preparation of the Fourth Punjab Education Sector Development Policy Credit
(PEDPC IV), Pakistan's economy had staged a remarkable turnaround, laying the ground for
sustained growth and poverty reduction. The good performance by the industrial and services
sector led to a significant acceleration in economic growth reaching 8.6% in 2004/05. In 2005/06,
the economy withstood serious adverse shocks emanating from a devastating earthquake, increase
in oil prices and less favorable weather conditions and registered a strong growth of 6.6%. All
segments of the population in rural and urban areas gained from income growth, poverty declined
significantly and the social indicators started to show some improvements, but still compared
poorly with those of other countries with similar level of per capita income. The Government
also embarked on several reforms to attract investments and improve the business climate in
Pakistan. Tax revenue collection during the first half of 2006/07 increased by 27% than the
corresponding period in the previous year. The results of the 2006/07 Pakistan Social and Living
Standards Measurement Survey (PSLMS) were also encouraging and showed an improvement in
education and health indicators. The federal government approved a five year Medium Term
Development Framework (MTDF) 2005-10, complementing the Poverty Reduction Strategy
Paper (PRSP).

Punjab, the most densely populated province of Pakistan with almost 56 percent of the country's
total population, showed better health and education outcomes as compared to the rest of the
country. The provincial revenue continued to show a healthy growth rate at about 15 percent p.a.
over the last five years (FY01-FY06). The government's fiscal strategy was effective in creating
significant fiscal space to sustain the wide ranging reform efforts that were initiated by the
government. The PEDPC IV followed the satisfactory completion of a series of Punjab
Education Development Policy Credits. The progress in education was declared commendable
by the implementation completion and results report (ICR) prepared at the completion of this
series. This progress was also evident through the PSLM 2006/07 results and enrolment data of
the Punjab Education Department. The 2006 Annual School Census data from the Education
Department showed significant progress in student enrolments since 2003, with an increase of
approximately 2.1 million students in grades 1 through 10. Girls' enrolment (an increase of 1.1
million) trends were slightly higher than that for boys (1 million).

Punjab Government's experience with the Development Policy Credits (DPCs) was evaluated as
highly successful not only in terms of access but also fiscal reforms, and the government
requested World Bank's support for the second phase of the Punjab Education Sector Reform
program (PESRP). The objectives of the phase II of PESRP were to improve performance and
quality of school education to improve students' learning outcomes; improve school participation
and retention rates; and reduce gender and regional disparities (grades 1-10). PEDPC IV was
closely aligned to the World Bank Country Assessment Strategy (CAS) approved in 2006; it also
shared the fiduciary and fiscal reform agenda with the Development Policy Lending (DPLs)
operations for irrigation in Punjab. The operation was also linked to other efforts to improve the
fiduciary environment such as Project to Improve Financial Reporting and Auditing (PIFRA) and
at the federal level with the Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC) series. At the provincial
level, the fiduciary reforms promoted under the PEDPC series were implemented by Government
in the Asian Development Bank-supported Provincial Resource Management Program (PRMP).




                                                1
The PEDPC IV was intended to be the first of a programmatic series of three development policy
credits providing continuity to the government's education reform program. By continuing and
deepening the already successful programs, such as girl's stipends and free textbooks, it provided
the necessary support to poor and rural households. The PEDPC was approved in June 2007 by
the Board of Executive Directors and IDA financing was committed through US$100 million
single tranche DPC. Follow up credits of US$100 million each were planned for FY08 and FY09
as part of the programmatic series in support of the government's medium term reform program.
The series, however, was discontinued, although the Bank continued to support the reform agenda
of PESRP through a programmatic investment lending operation (Punjab Education Sector
Project) , approved by the Board in June 2009 to support Government's PESRP for three years..

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

 The Fourth Punjab Education Development Policy Credit (PEDPC IV) was the first operation of
a series of three development policy credits designed to support the ongoing PESRP, which
entered a second Phase. Phase I was supported under a series of three programmatic Development
Policy Credits (DPCs) from 2004-2006. The PEDPC series were designed to support PESRP's
three pillars ­ i) to improve fiscal environment and accountability, ii) expand access and improve
quality and iv) improve education sector management and governance.

The objectives of the Phase II PESRP, as outlined in the project document were, to improve
performance and quality of school education to improve student learning outcomes; improve
school participation and retention rates; and reduce gender and regional disparities (grades 1-10).
Some of the results indicated in PEDPC IV for the three year DPC series were (i) 34% increase in
education allocations; (ii) increase in primary Net Enrolment Rate (NER) in primary, middle and
secondary from a 2006 baseline of 58%, 20% and 11% to 66%, 30% and 15% respectively by
2009/10; (iii) 5% increase in primary completion rate in government schools from 61% to 66%;
and, (iv) a percentage improvement in examination and assessment results.

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and Reasons/Justification
Neither the PDO nor the key indicators were revised.

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program
The Phase II reform program is based on the following three pillars:

I.      Enhance fiscal sustainability and improve the fiduciary environment to: (i) ensure
        that public expenditure continues to be increased for education at both provincial and
        district levels in accordance with sector needs; (ii) strengthen the districts financing
        capacity and ensure that adequate resources are transferred to districts to meet education
        needs; (iii) increase transparency of financial management and procurement processes
        and practices; and (iv) strengthen provincial and district capacities to monitor financial
        flows.

II.     Increase equitable access to education and improve quality and relevance of
        education. This forms the core reform agenda. Access agenda focuses on programs to: (i)
        increase participation, retention and completion rates, especially for girls; and (ii)
        encourage the participation of private sector. The quality agenda seeks to: (i) improve
        school performance and student learning outcomes; and (ii) improve quality of learning
        through better teaching practices, better textbooks and a credible examination system.



                                                2
III.       Improve public education sector governance and management to: (i) strengthen
           sector planning and policy development capacity of the provincial education department;
           (ii) strengthen district education departments' management and monitoring capacity; (iii)
           strengthen monitoring and evaluation to gauge education sector performance; and (iv)
           enhance school based management, and monitoring of school performance by
           communities.

1.5 Revised Policy Areas
The original Policy Areas were not revised

1.6 Other significant changes
The PEDPC IV was designed as the first in a second series of three programmatic DPC's to
support the government's ongoing education reforms under the PESRP. Because of the weak
macro-economic situation at the time, PEDPC V was not considered, and the series was
discontinued after the fourth education sector credit. Instead, a programmatic approach to
investment lending was considered to help sustain the fundamental policy shifts achieved under
the DPC series, and to emphasize the focus on implementation and results in the sector. The
support to the government's education sector reforms is now continued as a Sector Investment
Credit ­ the Punjab Education Sector Project (PESP). This program was approved by the Board
of Executive Directors of the Bank on June 4, 2009.

Since the start of the PESRP there has been a steady progress in the education reform program.
The implementation of the first phase of the PEDPC was declared highly satisfactory and
significant progress was made on increasing enrollments, sector financing and quality agenda.
Following the success of the three year DPC series, the implementation of PEDPC IV, although
faced with political, economic and security challenges, was satisfactory. The first and the second
phase of the DPC series are assessed to have been well embedded in the province's long-term
development agenda, thereby ensuring there was no rollback of the reform efforts even with the
changes in government. The achievement of all prior actions as stipulated in the program
document laid a good foundation for continuation of the reform program (Table 2).

There was a satisfactory trend in education budget increase and the commitments to MTBF were
                                                                                         1
maintained. The Government of Punjab's allocation for education at the provincial level
increased from Rs. 12.9 billion in 2005/06 to almost Rs. 24 billion in 2006/07 and Rs. 39 billion
in 2008/09. The government continues to give priority to development sectors, as is evident by2
the Budget 2008/09 in which education sector constituted almost 25 percent of the total ADP .

The Operation Policy Matrix set annual targets for each policy area, although the operation was
discontinued after the first year the Operation Policy Matrix guided the development of the new
lending program, PESP, and in defining the Disbursement Linked Indicators (DLIs) agreed under
the program.

The program performance is summarized pillar by pillar below:

Pillar 1: Enhancing fiscal sustainability and improving the fiduciary environment
There was satisfactory trend in increasing public allocations for education in the provincial and
district budgets. There was evidence of some weakening of the Punjab fiscal position but the
situation generally remained stable. The 2007/08 provincial and district budgets showed an
increase of approximately 33% allocation for education, this increasing trend continues in the
budget of 2008/09 as can be seen from Table 2. A review of the 2006/07 provincial and district
budgets shows an increase of 21% in allocation for education sector with recurrent allocation
being higher by 23% and development budget increasing by 12%, this trend continued in 2007/08
with an overall increase of 33 %, recurrent allocation being higher by 36% and development
increasing by 54%, see table 3 for details. (Since devolution, provinces have made district
allocations as a one line item. Each district makes its own sector allocations, at times also
receiving federal funding, as in the case of Higher Education. Therefore calculating exact district
allocations on education is a tedious task, PMIU has collected district level information on
education expenditure to present a picture of district allocations for education sector.)

The government has continued to develop MTBF, although at times with some delays, creating
additional fiscal space for spending on education reforms. A continued improvement in the
budgetary planning processes is evidenced by the preparation of a medium term sector framework
(MTSF) by the Education Department in close coordination with the Planning and Finance
Departments.




                                                  4
Continued implementation of fiscal management reforms resulted in an enhanced awareness of
accountability processes within the department. A Provincial Procurement Regulatory Authority
(PPRA) was established to oversee implementation of public procurement reforms, including
development of revised procurement rules. The PESP continues to emphasize the need for
continued improvement and capacity building of provincial staff on procurement and for further
improving procurement practices in the education sector; this was also reported as an important
area of support in the ICR of the first phase of PEDPC.

Pillar 2: Increasing equitable access to education and improving quality and relevance of
Education

One of the major achievements witnessed after the first phase of the PEDPC was a sharp increase
in net enrollment rates, at a much faster rate than in the rest of the country. Primary net
enrollments increased from 45% in 2001/02 to 62% in 2006/07, which was considerably higher
than the national average of 56%. The increasing trend was observed for both boys and girls, in
rural and urban areas and in public and private schools. Total enrolment in public sector
increased by 22%, and the private sector also showed improvements by making up approximately
40% of the total enrolment.

However, the increase in primary net enrolments has slowed down and shows a slight reversal of
1% by 2007/08. This may be attributed to an increase in the financial burden on families due to
rising inflation, lack of physical infrastructure to absorb the enrolment surge and the inability of
the quality actions to catch up with the increase in enrolments. This has been an important lesson
for the design of the new PESP initiative which emphasizes a deep coordination between demand
and supply side interventions to sustain the surge in enrolments overtime. The middle school
gross enrolments however, continued to show an encouraging trend during 2007 and beyond that
period. The 2007/08 PSLM survey showed middle school gross enrolment for Punjab at 59%, up
from 55% in the previous year, with a higher increase for girls as compared to boys. The
fluctuating enrolment figures (gross and net) are to be examined in detail to develop a better
understanding of the stagnation in net enrolments in government schools and to align program
support accordingly.

Under PEDPC IV, the government continued to roll out its programs to reduce costs and
encourage families to send children to schools. The stipend program was extended to include
girls enrolled in grade 9-10. As of 2007/08 roughly 350,000 girl students were benefitting from
the scheme. At the same time, the province saw an increase in the gross enrolment ratio for girls
in middle school from 43% in 2003 to 51% in 2007. The delivery of free textbooks increased
dramatically from distribution of 12.2 million free textbooks in 2004/05 to 27 million in 2007/08.
The delivery mechanisms for both stipends and textbooks have been improved over the years
resulting in timely and efficient delivery.

In addition to textbook distribution, PEDPC IV supported continuation of textbook reforms to
promote textbook development (printing and publishing) through an open competition process,
which has greatly improved the physical quality of the textbooks making them more attractive
and durable, and have led to further improvement in the procurement process of textbook
development, including opening up of authorship to private sector. Teacher professional
development reforms, with focus on putting in place on-site mentoring support for teachers was
also continued under PEDPC IV. Another key reform of PESRP was to improve quality of the
school examination system (Grades 5 and 8). The Punjab Examination Commission was unable
to conduct examinations in 2007 due to administrative and management weaknesses, but the
efforts to strengthen PEC as an autonomous body continued. PEC was able to hold exams in


                                                 5
2008 and 2009; results have been analyzed and made available on the PEC website for policy and
decision makers. These efforts are continuing to be supported by PESP, and the Government is
making effective use of these results to give incentives to teachers, and identifying schools
requiring the most support and directing specific incentives for teacher improvements.

Recognizing the key role that the private sector plays in enhancing access to education, the
Punjab Government continued to enhance its support to the Punjab Education Foundation (PEF)
for the Foundation Assisted Schools (FAS). PEF was restructured in 2004 as an autonomous
institution, but was provided public financing to support public-private partnerships, especially
for low-cost private schools. In the previous DPC series, the emphasis was on creating the legal
environment for establishing PEF's autonomy and for strengthening the management and
implementation systems. Under PEDPC IV, public funding for PEF increased from a baseline of
Rs. 500 million to approximately Rs. 3 billion in FY08. In recognition of the role PEF has played
in increasing access and quality of education in underserved areas, the current MTSF envisages
expanding public financial support for PEF to Rs. 4 billion. With this enhanced support, more
than half a million children in Punjab studying in low cost private schools are now benefiting
from public support through PEF. The success of the governance structure and autonomous
functioning of PEF model has led to good results and triggered a similar initiative in Sindh
Province.

The program for provision of missing facilities first initiated in March 2004 continued to be
pursued under PEDPC IV, by 2006 approximately 33,140 physical infrastructure schemes were
completed out of the 36,495 approved by the Government. Implementation was assessed to be
slow and several initiatives to speed up construction work and improve its quality were discussed
and explored under this program, including expanding the role of School Councils in civil works
oversight and management (although there is a long way to go to strengthen community
participation in this area). The missing facilities were implemented by district governments, and
funds made available directly under PESRP to districts as part of the Terms of Partnership, in
2006-07 Rs. 2.5 billion were allocated for missing facilities.

Pillar 3: Improve public education sector governance and management

The education department took important steps to improve education sector management at the
district level, specifically focusing on the capacity building of district management staff. After
reorganization of district education staff into functional lines, a training program in partnership
with a private training institution (Government College University) was developed under PEDPC
IV to help build skills in management, planning, financial management and other aspects.
Although training activities were slow to start and could not be initiated under PEDPC IV, these
are now being held. To date, three batches of district education staff have completed training
and received advance certificates in education management (84 officers) and five batches of
certificate in education management (145 officers). The Punjab Government is continuing with
this phased training program, and is planning to undertake a review of district education
management system to explore options for better management models.

The monitoring system of the education sector, coordinated by the PMIU, has been the strength
of the program; please see section 2.3 for more details. Regular collection of data, monitoring
visits to schools and monthly review meetings with districts are some of the key aspects of the
monitoring system. The data and analysis continues to guide and shape program performance and
implementation.

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation:

Overall the government remained committed to the broad goals of the reform program and
political support did not weaken over several years of implementation. Some key factors that
created greater and sustained political ownership and appetite for continuing with reforms
included the following.

The participation and ownership of key stakeholder departments, including Finance and Planning
and district governments was integral to PESRP implementation, and part of the previous DPC
series as well as during PEDPC IV.

A substantial focus on quality improvements in education was introduced in the second phase of
the PESRP support supported by PEDPC IV. The earlier focus on institutional reforms (such as
for teacher professional development, examinations, textbooks) under the first series created the
foundation for an enhanced emphasis on quality improvement.

Strong MIS and data analysis continued to help monitor progress and guide design and
implementation of education activities in the province. This remained the strongest component of
the reform program. Information is now readily available to make decisions about teacher
recruitments, incentives, school up gradation and analyzing factors that impact student learning.

Regular and sustained dialogue between the Bank and senior level Government officials and
various stakeholders at the district and school level played a key role in supporting the new
government in implementing improvements in sector governance. At the same time, technical
inputs from Bank staff through, for example, analytical reports and a variety of just-in-time policy
and technical assistance notes have supported design and implementation.

The government ensured that other donors support the reform framework, discouraging
standalone supply side or project initiatives. UNICEF's technical support was directed to support
the PEC, while CIDA's support was utilized for the strengthening of teacher education initiatives
in the province. Similary, GTZ has recently started providing support to the province on
textbooks and learning material development in line with the PESRP framework.

Continuity in the Bank's support and message were central to guiding implementation. The
continuity of the DPC series has clearly shown the Government and Bank's commitment to the
PESRP agenda. This is even now continued through a new lending operation as the PESP.




                                                 8
Risks were well identified and mitigated through program design. The risk mitigation strategy
predicted that the good implementation will ensure public pressure to continue program activities
even if there is a change in political leadership; this was proved correct as the new political
leadership fully endorsed the PESRP and is continuing to support the new lending operation.

Despite these positive factors, there were numerous factors that slowed down implementation.
The year 2007 was marked by several economic and political upheavals. After several months of
political turmoil and security concerns Emergency was declared in the country in November,
followed immediately by the assassination of Benazir Bhutto in December 2007. These and
preceding actions at times completely stalled implementation, and at others slowed them down.
Political commitment although remained strong but attention was diverted to the economic and
security concerns facing the country. The macroeconomic growth seen in advance of project
preparation was not sustained during implementation, due in part to the various crises (food, fuel
and financial) that likely increased the opportunity cost associated with going to school (or
sending one's children to school). These factors greatly affected the achievement of quantitative
targets envisaged under the program but the government's commitment to continue reforms and
policies was commendable.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

Strong monitoring systems and data analyses have been instrumental in refining program
implementation and in shaping policies. The government selected a few and focused indicators
that were a continuation of the first phase DPC, the only addition being a focus on children's
learning achievements. This was an important addition to the framework, focusing governments'
attention on the quality agenda, along with access. This also resulted in the need to collate
relevant and authentic data on children's learning, some sources of this information are PEAS,
PEC and the Learning and Educational Achievement in Punjab Schools study.

The use of timely data and information has been embedded in the PESRP implementation. The
PEDPC IV continued the emphasis on strong field monitoring system that is now incorporated
into the district education department's main responsibilities. The Government approved a
performance monitoring index comprising of twelve simple indicators to measure and monitor
district performance (see box below), this is now referred to as the performance management
index. This index has enabled the PMIU to provide specific feedback to the district governments
on areas where improvements are required. The Program Management and Implementation Unit
(PMIU) operates a comprehensive system of monitoring performance and results using
information from Districts, Directorate of Staff Development (DSD), Punjab Examination
Commission (PEC) and Punjab Education Assessment System (PEAS). The information is
widely disseminated on the governments' website.

M&E implementation has received extensive support throughout the first DPC series, and
continued under PEDPC IV. Punjab has the most extensive education monitoring system
tracking sector expenditures, supported through the public financial management system. Sector
monitoring of implementation through the Monitoring and Evaluation Assistants (MEAs)
provides updated information on a regular basis. To effectively implement M&E, the government
of Punjab developed a comprehensive capacity building project for local government education
managers. This capacity building scheme provided logistical support (vehicles), technical
support (computers) and managerial training (discussed above) on education management. While
the hardware support was provided under PEDPC IV, the training activities are now underway.
In addition to the ongoing monitoring by PMIU the M&E was supported by third party validation



                                                9
(TPVs). The TPVs conducted so far are on a range of activities to test the validity of enrolment
data, quality of civil works and distribution of stipends and textbooks.

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation (if any):
The discontinuation of the second phase of the DPC series after only the first of three planned
credits was immediately followed by the preparation of the Punjab Education Support Project,
approved on June 4, 2009 by the Board ($350 million over 3 years). The lessons learned from the
DPC series were incorporated into the design of the program and many of the initiatives build on
the momentum initiated under the previous programs. The PESP is a specific investment credit
using a programmatic approach, disbursing against achievement of education sector indicators
directly the government's budget. This is an innovative instrument maintaining a focus on
implementation outcomes through the achievement of measurable targets while providing an
enhanced focus on strengthening associated provincial systems through technical capacity
building and implementation support. The Operation Policy Matrix targets set the foundation for
the PESP Disbursement Linked Indicator matrix. In addition, the PESP provides continued
assistance over 3 years, reflecting the Bank's commitment and predictability of financing,
predicated on achievement of results.

An important lesson learned from the DPC series was to explore mechanisms to sustain the surge
in enrolments observed in the province due to a focus on access related incentives. A study is
planned under the present PESP support, this will explore the reasons for dropping primary
enrolments in public schools and attempt to match quality initiatives to sustaining and improving
enrolments.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Relevance of Objectives: The objectives of the project were relevant and consistent with the
Bank's Country Assistance Strategy for 2006-2009. This CAS emphasized strengthened


                                                10
macroeconomic management and resource utilization (CAS Pillar 1), strengthened governance
and service delivery (CAS Pillar 2), and improving lives and protecting the vulnerable. Theses
priorities are core elements of the program objectives and design.

The project also contributed to Pakistan's priority for investing in human development articulated
in PRSP II (Government of Pakistan, 2009), finalized in January 2009. PRSP II emphasizes the
need (i) to address financing for the sector; strengthen planning and implementation capacity; (ii)
improve resource utilization; (iii) enhance governance for greater accountability of education
providers to the community; (iv) build capacity of district and local institutions; and (v)
strengthen the role of school committees; all of which are central in PERSP.

Design and Implementation: The design of the project was relevant, reflecting proper diagnosis
and plans to meet the development priorities. The program's focus on (i) implementation
capacity, (ii) governance reforms; (iii) strengthening monitoring and evaluation; and (iv)
improved service delivery for underserved groups were appropriately identified as key issues for
effective service delivery. The Bank's implementation assistance was responsive to the
government's needs. The Bank team engaged in high level policy dialogue throughout project
implementation, and provided continued technical assistance. In addition, the shift in Bank
support from the series of policy credits to investment and results based financing reflected the
enhanced focus on implementation outcomes and the need to strengthen associated provincial
systems through technical capacity building and implementation support.

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives

PEDPC IV was expected to be the first in a series of three DPCs, the PDOs and targets were
therefore framed in the context of a three year program. The progress on the achievement of
quantitative targets by the end of PEDPC IV varies, the province however continued to show
satisfactory progress on gross enrolments, fiscal reforms and policy interventions. A detailed
progress against the PDO indicators and some of the intermediate indicators are given below.

PDO Indicator 1: Increase in: a) primary completion rates in government schools; b)
enrolments in public schools grade pre-primary to X; c) female participation rates in government
schools as % of total enrolment
Although the gains in this indicator are not very significant but the support provided by the
PEDPC program ensured there was no regression due to economic and political turmoil facing the
country. The fiscal reforms supported under pillar 1 greatly improved the fiduciary environment
of the province, the education budget continued to show an increase for both recurrent and
development allocations. Financial commitments for key interventions supporting access such as
stipends and textbooks were maintained, reducing the direct cost of schooling for poor and
disadvantaged households. The absolute enrolment figures in government schools increased from
the baseline of 11 million in 2006 to 11.2 million, this is calculated as an annual increase of 2%
as compared to the 3% envisaged in the targets. The participation of girls in government schools
showed a varying trend, remaining static for primary, increasing by 1% for middle level and
dropping by 1% for secondary level.

PDO Indicator 2: % Increase in: a) Primary NER and GER (Male/Female); b) middle NER and
GER (male and female); c) Secondary NER and GER (Male/female)

As explained above the programs combined focus on fiscal reforms and maintaining education
budget for key activities allowed the province to show progress achieved in the previous DPC
series, in addition to the above, the program also supported capacity and system improvement to


                                                11
improve service delivery. A significant achievement of the previous DPC series was recruitment
of more than 49,000 teachers to address student teacher ratios and reduce the number of non-
functional schools; under PEDPC IV the policy for recruitment was further improved resulting in
a plan to hire 34,000 more teachers in 2008/09. The program specially focused on increasing
specialist teachers in middle and secondary schools. PSLM data of 2006/07 collected for both
public and private schools shows a slight improvement in primary gross enrolments for both boys
and girls. The middle school gross enrollment also shows an increasing trend that continues
across 2005/06 through 2007/08. This is especially encouraging for girls' enrollment as it
indicates an increase of approximately 6%. The gross enrollments for secondary level also show
good improvement for both girls and boys, suggesting progress towards achievement of targets
indicated in PEDPC IV. The slow progress in primary enrolments is however a clear indication of
a need to focus program activities on improving access and quality to ensure gains in enrollments
can be sustained over the years.

PDO Indicator 3: Reduction in primary age out of school children
The program anticipated that increasing enrollments and bringing out-of-school children will
require schools to be physically ready. Activities were designed to provide districts with need-
based and performance -based grants to undertake infrastructure improvements, this combined
with policies to support free education, free textbooks, low-cost private schooling and stipends
has contributed to reducing out of school children. Previous assessments of civil works had raised
concerns about slow progress, quality and piecemeal selection of missing facilities in schools.
The program supported the use of external contracting mechanisms to speed up school up-
gradation and rehabilitation work, this not only improved the capacity of the education
department to undertake contracts but also allowed them to focus on whole-school approach to
providing missing facilities. There was a slight reduction in the percentage of primary age (5-9
years old) out of school children from 40% baseline to 38%; however this was still better in
comparison to national averages. There is a continued need to improve district management
capacity to plan, assess and deliver on school improvements in the province.

PDO Indicator 4 and 5: a) Improvement in matriculation pass rates; and b) % improvement in
standardized grade V and grade VIII examination results
Student performance improved (using national assessment test results as baseline)
Although quality achievements anticipated in the DPC series could not be quantified in one year
of implementation, however there was good progress made to introduce innovative activities to
improve and measure quality of teaching and learning in schools. Textbooks that are at times the
only learning tool in schools are now out-sourced, the competition allowing the government to
select the best quality books, textbook procurement reforms are still underway in the new PESP
initiative. Efforts were made to strengthen PEC and the results on national assessments were
shared widely to influence policy making. District support cluster centers were developed for 16
districts to provide on-site support for continuous professional development of teachers and the
monthly reports collected by the PMIU indicated an improvement in student attendance and
teacher absenteeism in schools. The CPD program made operational in 12 districts is ongoing;
expansion in other districts is envisaged under PESP after an evaluation of the first phase of
implementation in 12 districts.

Among the intermediate outcome indicators a most significant achievement of the first year was
the increase in PEF funding which increased substantially to Rs. 2.5 billion from a baseline of Rs.
500 million. PEF continues to be recognized as an important activity that is contributing to
improving access and quality of education in underserved areas. The success of PEF can be
contributed to the program's emphasis on regular assessments and documentation of PEF



                                                12
activities and ensuring that PEF systems follow the highest accountability standards. This has
contributed to the government's acceptance and expansion of this innovative scheme.

A significant contribution of the program in achieving all PDOs has been its focus on monitoring
and evaluation with efficient data collection and analysis at the provincial, district and school
level. This emphasis on data analysis has not only contributed to improved planning, management
and decision making by government but has also raised awareness among all stakeholders about
the issues in schools, especially in the rural areas. The database continues to be used for teacher
incentives, evaluation of district performance

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory
The achievement of the development outcomes is rated satisfactory, reflecting progress towards
achievement for most of the key performance indicators. While some of the indicators have not
fully achieved the targets, this assessment is limited to occur well in advance of target completion
date. Nevertheless, there has been substantial progress across all indicators, and in many cases
achievement of targets well in advance of projected completion date. The substantial achievement
in most of the key project development outcomes has resulted in improvements in the access,
equity and quality of the education sector. In addition, the PDOs remained relevant throughout
project implementation and continue to remain relevant today. These achievements are expected
to have long term benefits of positive impact on level of human capital and economic
development as the investments are sustained.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
 The incentives provided under the PESRP helped increase the enrollment of children in school
 by reducing the cost of education and providing households an incentive to send children to
 school. These incentives were also designed to improve equity across regional and gender
 disparities. The program has also subsidized private schooling for children who would
 otherwise be unable to study in private schools.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

Implementation of PEDPC has resulted in many significant institutional changes, thereby
strengthening capacity. Some of the most significant areas of improvement are listed below:
    i.  Fiscal sustainability and effectiveness of public expenditures have been improved
        through a continued focus on MTBF processes and financial management and
        procurement reforms.
   ii.  Education department's capacity has been strengthened through continued technical
        assistance and the supporting role played by the PMIU, which is an integral arm of the
        education department. The PMIU is the primary coordination unit for informing policy
        formulation, monitoring and evaluation, donor coordination and other reform initiatives.
  iii.  MIS has greatly strengthened the planning processed in the education department
        resulting in information based decision making.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative, if any)
The program has greatly unified donor support in the province, providing a single platform for
education development.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate
There were a number of identified risks that threatened the sustainability of the reform program,
and possibly negatively impacting the progress and achievement of the PDOs. These included: (i)
declining political commitment to the reform program; (ii) uncertainty in political stability; (iii)
capacity constraints, despite improvements to date; and (iv) questions of national security that
limit Bank supervision. However, by maintaining intensive policy dialogue and continued and
sustained support over a number of years, these risks were mitigated and reduced. Some
mitigation measures that were undertaken as part of both PEDPC and PESP included: (i)
intensive, high quality and continued dialogue between the Bank team and government; (ii)
strong emphasis on continued capacity building for the implementation of reform initiatives; and
(iii) systematic third party validations and ability for video-conference supervision in the event of
restricted mission. Further, ownership of the education reforms and widespread awareness
among communities created an irreversible demand on government ­ despite changes in
government ­ to continue on the same path of objectives that PESRP had promoted.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
   Rating: Satisfactory
The Bank performance for ensuring quality at entry is rated as satisfactory. The Bank team
remained proactively engaged with the government on the program design, including policy
dialogue, while reinforcing ownership and active participation and consultation of various
stakeholders, from provincial to district government. In addition, project objectives established at
entry remained relevant through implementation and continue to be in line with country priorities
because of sound design focused on addressing key poverty, gender and social development
aspects.

(b) Quality of Supervision
    Rating: Satisfactory
The quality of supervision is rated as satisfactory. The Bank's task team was composed of Human
Development, PREM, Financial Management and Procurement, and Social Assessment staff and
international and national consultants who contributed significantly. The cross sectoral support
was exemplary, with seamless integration of reforms across the various sectors in the project. The
close collaboration with the government during preparation and negotiation continued through
implementation, and ultimately the preparation of the PESP. In addition, strong donor
coordination, notably with DFID, UNICEF, CIDA and GTZ, enabled better alignment of
technical expertise and sources while reduced the reporting burden for the government.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
    Rating: Satisfactory
The Bank team worked closely with the government, proactively engaged in design and
preparation of the project. Strong dialogue with key policy makers was maintained to ensure
quality during implementation. The team, consisting of staff from various sectors of the Bank,
maintained efficient supervision and monitoring of the program. The engagement and close
collaboration ensured a continued dialogue, resulting in the preparation of the PESP.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
    Rating: Satisfactory

The government showed high ownership and commitment to implement the project at all levels
and across departments. This was demonstrated by instituting crosscutting reforms, both in the
education sector and in public finance, and making considerable progress to improve service
delivery. Monitoring and evaluation system were maintained and analysis was actively used for
decision making and performance monitoring.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
     Rating: Satisfactory
The Education Department under the leadership of the Punjab Government demonstrated due
diligence and commitment to implement activities agreed under the program. The PMIU formed
under the PESRP played a key role in managing and monitoring the reform program and in
providing regular analysis to inform program implementation and decision making. PMIU also
played a key role in the timely and quality distribution of free textbook delivery and girls'
stipends. The linkages between districts and provincial education departments were strengthened,
supporting service delivery at the school level.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
     Rating: Satisfactory

The Borrower ensured quality at preparation and implementation and complied with covenants
and agreements, ensuring progress toward the achievement of development objectives.

6. Lessons Learned
There are many lessons from the implementation of PEDPC, many of which were included in the
design of the PESP:

Sustained sector improvement requires higher level alignment at both political and bureaucratic
levels and overall enabling fiscal and fiduciary frameworks. Lessons from PEDPC have
confirmed that leadership and political championship are critical for successful implementation of
sustainable reforms.

A sector program that combines sector-specific interventions with cross-cutting fiscal and
fiduciary interventions is more likely to yield results and to be sustained. It also contributes to
increased ownership of the sector program beyond the line department. A strong partnership
between key stakeholders ­ Planning and Development, Finance and Education Departments
(P&D, FD and ED respectively) ­ facilitated increased implementation momentum.

Complementary non-lending analytical and advisory support and sustained dialogue is essential.
Bank engagement at the highest political levels played a key role in supporting the new
government in implementing improvements in sector governance. At the same time, technical
inputs from Bank staff through, for example, analytical reports and a variety of just-in-time policy
and technical assistance notes supported design and implementation.

Given the educational context in Pakistan, it is important to simultaneously address the issues of
school access and quality. Without quality, access may start showing a downward trend over




                                                15
time. There is deeper coordination required between putting children in schools and ensuring that
schools are the learning places that can contribute to children's development.

A good monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system that provides timely and reliable information is
essential. A well-designed and comprehensive M&E framework needs to be integrated into the
design of any sector-wide program. Establishment of baselines, followed by intensive
monitoring, and verification/triangulation from different data sources increases the credibility of
and accountability for results. The use of data in planning and monitoring itself helps focus
attention on the quality of monitoring data and on improving their reliability. A reliable and
comprehensive monitoring and evaluation system can contribute to the political sustainability of
programs; it also facilitates mid-course program corrections and refinements.

Systematic communication can play a key role in ensuring wider understanding and ownership.
Strategic communications can increase understanding among the general public, media and civil
society, local communities as well as internal stakeholders such as teachers or other employees.
This involves two way communications and extensive consultations. An outcome of such
communication and creation of wide ownership was the continuation of PESRP when the
leadership and government of the province underwent a change.

Focused and consistent messages in the government and World Bank dialogue can be critical to
ensuring continued implementation progress even after project preparation and approval.

                 Punjab Education Sector Reform Program (PESRP)

        PUNJAB EDUCATION DEVELOPMENT POLICY CREDIT (PEDPC)


1. Program Objectives, Design and Implementation

   The PEDPC IV was intended to be the first of a programmatic series of three development policy
   credits providing continuity to the government's education reform program. By continuing and
   deepening the already successful programs, such as girl's stipends and free textbooks, it provided the
   necessary support to poor and rural households. The PEDPC was approved in June 2007 by the Board
   of Executive Directors and IDA financing was committed through US$100 million single tranche
   DPC. Follow up credits of US$100 million each were planned for FY08 and FY09 as part of the
   programmatic series in support of the government's medium term reform program. The series,
   however, was discontinued, although the Bank continued to support the reform agenda of PESRP
   through a programmatic investment lending operation (Punjab Education Sector Project) , approved
   by the Board in June 2009 to support Government's PESRP for three years.

1.1. Key Program Objectives

   The Fourth Punjab Education Development Policy Credit (PEDPC IV) was the first operation of a
   series of three development policy credits designed to support the ongoing PESRP, which entered a
   second Phase. Phase I was supported under a series of three programmatic Development Policy
   Credits (DPCs) from 2004-2006. The PEDPC series were designed to support PESRP's three pillars:

       ·   To improve fiscal environment and accountability,
       ·   Expand access and improve quality and
       ·   Improve education sector management and governance.

   The objectives of the Phase II PESRP were:
       - to improve performance and quality of school education
       - to improve student learning outcomes
       - to improve school participation and retention rates
       - to reduce gender and regional disparities (grades 1-10).

   Some of the results indicated in PEDPC IV for the three year DPC series were (i) 34% increase in
   education allocations; (ii) increase in primary Net Enrolment Rate (NER) in primary, elementary and
   secondary from a 2006 baseline of 58%, 20% and 11% to 66%, 30% and 15% respectively by
   2009/10; (iii) 5% increase in primary completion rate in government schools from 61% to 66%; and,
   (iv) a percentage improvement in examination and assessment results.

1.2. Program Design

  The Phase II reform program is based on the following three pillars:

III.    Enhance fiscal sustainability and improve the fiduciary environment to: (i) ensure that


                                                21
          public expenditure continues to be increased for education at both provincial and district levels in
          accordance with sector needs; (ii) strengthen the districts financing capacity and ensure that
          adequate resources are transferred to districts to meet education needs; (iii) increase transparency
          of financial management and procurement processes and practices; and (iv) strengthen provincial
          and district capacities to monitor financial flows.

 IV.      Increase equitable access to education and improve quality and relevance of education. This
          formed the core reform agenda. Access agenda focused on programs to: (i) increase participation,
          retention and completion rates, especially for girls; and (ii) encourage the participation of private
          sector. The quality agenda aimed to: (i) improve school performance and student learning
          outcomes; and (ii) improve quality of learning through better teaching practices, better textbooks
          and a credible examination system.

 III.     Improve public education sector governance and management to: (i) strengthen sector
          planning and policy development capacity of the provincial education department; (ii) strengthen
          district education departments' management and monitoring capacity; (iii) strengthen monitoring
          and evaluation to gauge education sector performance; and (iv) enhance school based
          management, and monitoring of school performance by communities.

1.3. Expected Benefits:

        The program helped school education department to focus on key areas and as a result enrolment of
        students at all level witnessed significant increase. It also helped to identify weaknesses in the
        system which necessitated improvement in the financial resources and continuous oversight on
        different initiatives under implementation. In addition to this the following benefits were also
        achieved:
              · All initiatives in the school education department were taken on the basis of data and this
                  helped the department to use resources wherever they were required.
              · Recruitment of educators, up gradation and missing facilities were provided on the basis
                  of need and this practice resulted in efficient use of funds and resources made available to
                  schools.
              · To improve learning and teaching environment at schools the role of school councils was
                  enhanced and a comprehensive guideline was developed by the PMIU to be used by the
                  school councils. As a result most of the issues pertaining to procurement of learning
                  material and other minor expenditures were addressed.
              · The PMIU (PESRP) instituted a comprehensive monitoring system through which all
                  schools were monitored and performance of districts was measured against key indicators.

1.4. Program Implementation and Operational Experience

 Since the start of the PESRP there has been a steady progress in the education reform program.
 The implementation of the first phase of the PEDPC was declared highly satisfactory and
 significant progress was made on increasing enrollments, sector financing and quality agenda.
 Following the success of the three year DPC series, the implementation of PEDPC IV, although
 faced with political, economic and security challenges, was commendable. The first and the
 second phase of the DPC series are assessed to have been well embedded in the province's long-
 term development agenda, thereby ensuring there was no rollback of the reform efforts even with
 the changes in government. The achievement of all prior actions as stipulated in the program
 document laid a good foundation for continuation of the reform program (Table 2).



                                                  22
There was a satisfactory trend in education budget increase and the commitments to MTBF were
                                                                                         3
maintained. The Government of Punjab's allocation for education at the provincial level
increased from Rs. 12.9 billion in 2005/06 to almost Rs. 24 billion in 2006/07 and Rs. 39 billion
in 2008/09. The government continues to give priority to development sectors, as is evident by4
the Budget 2008/09 in which education sector constituted almost 25 percent of the total ADP .
The Operation Policy Matrix set annual targets for each policy area, although the operation was
discontinued after the first year the Operation Policy Matrix guided the development of the new
lending program, Punjab Education Support Program (PESP) and in defining the Disbursement
Linked Indicators (DLIs) agreed under the program.
    1.4.1. Performance under Reform Program Pillars

      Pillar 1: Enhancing fiscal sustainability and improving the fiduciary environment

      Achievements:

       -   Public allocations for education in the provincial and district budgets were increased. The
           2007/08 provincial and district budgets allocation for education increased by 33% and
           this increasing trend continued in the budget of 2008/09. A review of the 2006/07
           provincial and district budgets shows an increase of 21% in allocation for education
           sector with recurrent allocation being higher by 23% and development budget increasing
           by 12%, this trend continued in 2007/08 with an overall increase of 33 %, recurrent
           allocation being higher by 36% and development increasing by 54%.
       -   Since devolution, provinces have made district allocations as a one line item. Each
           district makes its own sector allocations, at times also receiving federal funding, as in the
           case of Higher Education. Therefore calculating exact district allocations on education is
           a tedious task, PMIU has collected district level information on education expenditure to
           present a picture of district allocations for education sector.
       -   The government has continued to develop MTBF, although at times with some delays,
           creating additional fiscal space for spending on education reforms. A continued
           improvement in the budgetary planning processes is evidenced by the preparation of a
           medium term sector framework (MTSF) by the Education Department in close
           coordination with the Planning and Finance Departments.
       -   Continued implementation of fiscal management reforms resulted in an enhanced
           awareness of accountability processes within the department. A Provincial Procurement
           Regulatory Authority (PPRA) was established to oversee implementation of public
           procurement reforms, including development of revised procurement rules. The PESP
           continues to emphasize the need for continued improvement and capacity building of
           provincial staff on procurement and for further improving procurement practices in the
           education sector; this was also reported as an important area of support in the ICR of the
           first phase of PEDPC.

      Operational Experience:

      The provincial government developed Medium Term Development Framework (MTDF)
      through which financial support to the education sector was ensured. This three year MTDF
      ear marked the resources against all sectors and those particular to education were especially

  increased and protected throughout this period. MTDF and Medium Term Financial
  Framework (MTFF) showed commitment of the provincial government and improved
  financial management.

  In order to ensure better financial management a high level focus was given to the settlement
  of audit paragraph. A committee under the chairmanship of Additional Chief Secretary Punjab
  was constituted to oversee progress vis a vis settlement of audit paragraphs at provincial level.

  The school education department maintains huge number of DDOs who require
  comprehensive and continuous training for better financial management. To address this need
  the project also provided an opportunity to the education department staff to have their
  capacity built under different training programs at both provincial and district levels.

Pillar 2: Increasing equitable access to education and improving quality and relevance of
Education

  Achievements:

    -   A sharp increase in net enrollment rates, at a much faster rate than in the rest of the
         country. Primary enrollments increased from 45% in 2001/02 to 62% in 2006/07, which
         was considerably higher than the national average of 56%. The increasing trend was
         observed for both boys and girls, in rural and urban areas and in public and private
         schools. Total enrolment in public sector increased by 22%, and the private sector also
         showed improvements by making up approximately 40% of the total enrolment.
    -   The government continued to roll out its programs to reduce costs and encourage families
         to send children to schools. The stipend program was extended to include girls enrolled
         in grade 9-10. As of 2007/08 roughly 350,000 girl students were benefitting from the
         scheme. At the same time, the province saw an increase in the gross enrolment ratio for
         girls in middle school from 43% in 2003 to 51% in 2007.
    -   The delivery of free textbooks increased dramatically from distribution of 12.2 million
         free textbooks in 2004/05 to 27 million in 2007/08. The delivery mechanisms for both
         stipends and textbooks have been improved over the years resulting in timely and
         efficient delivery.
    -   In addition to textbook distribution, PEDPC IV supported continuation of textbook
         reforms to promote textbook development (printing and publishing) through an open
         competition process, which has greatly improved the physical quality of the textbooks
         making them more attractive and durable, and have led to further improvement in the
         procurement process of textbook development, including opening up of authorship to
         private sector.
    -   Teacher professional development reforms, with focus on putting in place on-site
         mentoring support for teachers was also continued under PEDPC IV.
    -   Another key reform of PESRP was to improve quality of the school examination system
         (Grades 5 and 8). The Punjab Examination Commission was unable to conduct
         examinations in 2007 due to administrative and management weaknesses, but the efforts
         to strengthen PEC as an autonomous body continued. PEC was able to hold exams in
         2008 and 2009; results have been analyzed and made available on the PEC website for
         policy and decision makers. These efforts are continuing to be supported by PESP, and
         the Government is making effective use of these results to give incentives to teachers,
         and identifying schools requiring the most support and directing specific incentives for
         teacher improvements.



                                               24
 -   Recognizing the key role that the private sector plays in enhancing access to education,
     the Punjab Government continued to enhance its support to the Punjab Education
     Foundation (PEF) for the Foundation Assisted Schools (FAS). PEF was restructured in
     2004 as an autonomous institution, but was provided public financing to support public-
     private partnerships, especially for low-cost private schools. In the previous DPC series,
     the emphasis was on creating the legal environment for establishing PEF's autonomy and
     for strengthening the management and implementation systems. Under PEDPC IV,
     public funding for PEF increased from a baseline of Rs. 400 million to approximately
     Rs. 3 billion in FY08. In recognition of the role PEF has played in increasing access and
     quality of education in underserved areas, the current MTSF envisages expanding public
     financial support for PEF to Rs. 4 billion. With this enhanced support, more than half a
     million children in Punjab studying in low cost private schools are now benefiting from
     public support through PEF. The success of the governance structure and autonomous
     functioning of PEF model has led to good results and triggered a similar initiative in
     Sindh Province.
 -   The program for provision of missing facilities first initiated in March 2004 continued to
     be pursued under PEDPC IV, by 2006 approximately 33,140 physical infrastructure
     schemes were completed out of the 36,495 approved by the Government.
     Implementation was assessed to be slow and several initiatives to speed up construction
     work and improve its quality were discussed and explored under this program, including
     expanding the role of School Councils in civil works oversight and management
     (although there is a long way to go to strengthen community participation in this area).
     The missing facilities were implemented by district governments, and funds made
     available directly under PESRP to districts as part of the Terms of Partnership, in 2006-
     07 Rs. 2.5 billion were allocated for missing facilities.

Operational Experience:

Under PESRP the provincial government initiated a program to bridge missing facilities in all
public sector schools in a phased manner. PMIU generates a list of schools on the basis of
need and enrolment load. These schools are surveyed by the joint survey team, constituted for
the purpose, and then prioritized by the district steering committee for undertaking of missing
facilities schemes. Once a school was selected all its missing facilities were addressed in one
go. Similarly, in order to improve access schools were upgraded on the basis of approved
criteria. This system of prioritizing schools according to criteria is now being accepted and
implemented by the districts.

The stipend program was successful and contributed to increasing enrolment. However, the
districts faced some capacity issues vis a vis delivery of stipends by the post offices. The post
office staff handles delivery of stipends manually and the capacity of this channel is not
enough to manage huge number of money orders particularly in districts where the enrolment
of girls ranges from 3000 ­ 40000.

Over the span of five years PMIU has managed to identify and rectify loop holes in the
delivery of text books. The system is now more institutionalized at both the provincial and
district level and ensures delivery of books within the first week of the start of the academic
year to all students in schools.
The Directorate of Staff Development (DSD) has successfully launched Continuous
Professional Development program (CPD) in twelve districts of Punjab. Under this program
the District Teacher Educator (DTE) provided on site support to teachers. In view of the



                                             25
   success of the program the CPD framework is being rolled out in another twelve districts of
   Punjab. The mandate of the DTEs has been enhanced to include all teachers.

   Punjab Examination Commission (PEC) successfully conducted class 5 and 8 examinations
   during 2008 and 2009. PEC data has enabled the school education department to identify
   schools and subjects which are showing unsatisfactory results. The department plans to launch
   a study to identify weaknesses in learning outcomes of children and school facilities and
   suggest measures to make improvements.

   PEF is expanding its operations to cover areas where the access issue is acute. Due to support
   to the private sector, enrolment in PEF assisted schools has witnessed huge increase. PEF is
   now assisting the private sector to set up new schools in areas still not covered by both the
   public and private sector.

   Pillar 3: Improve public education sector governance and management

   Achievements:

    -   The education department took important steps to improve education sector management
        at the district level, specifically focusing on the capacity building of district management
        staff. After reorganization of district education staff into functional lines, a training
        program in partnership with a private training institution (Government College
        University) was developed under PEDPC IV to help build skills in management,
        planning, financial management and other aspects. Although training activities were
        slow to start and could not be initiated under PEDPC IV, these are now being held.
    -   To date, three batches of district education staff have completed training and received
        advance certificates in education management (84 officers) and five batches of certificate
        in education management (145 officers).
    -   The Punjab Government is continuing with this phased training program, and is planning
        to undertake a review of district education management system to explore options for
        better management models.

   Operational Experience:

   Education in Punjab is a huge sector and faced with a lot of problems. Capacity constraints
   both at provincial and district level hamper efforts in implementation of various initiatives. In
   order to overcome this capacity problem the department has launched a capacity building
   program for District Education Managers. However, the department feels that mere capacity
   building of the district education staff will not solve the problem and there is a need to create
   financial and administratively independent authority at each district for effective management.
   This proposal is being considered seriously for implementation by the provincial government.


2. Assessment of Outcomes

PEDPC IV was expected to be the first in a series of three DPCs, the PDOs and targets were
therefore framed in the context of a three year program. The progress on the achievement of
these targets by the end of PEDPC IV was satisfactory, detailed progress against the PDO
indicators and some of the intermediate indicators are given below.




                                                26
PDO Indicator 1: Increase in: a) primary completion rates in government schools; b)
enrolments in public schools grade pre-primary to X; c) female participation rates in government
schools as % of total enrolment
Although the gains in this indicator are not very significant but the support provided by the
PEDPC program ensured there was no regression due to economic and political turmoil facing the
country. The fiscal reforms supported under pillar 1 greatly improved the fiduciary environment
of the province, the education budget continued to show an increase for both recurrent and
development allocations. Financial commitments for key interventions supporting access such as
stipends and textbooks were maintained, reducing the direct cost of schooling for poor and
disadvantaged households. The absolute enrolment figures in government schools increased from
the baseline of 11 million in 2006 to 11.2 million, this is calculated as an annual increase of 2%
as compared to the 3% envisaged in the targets. The participation of girls in government schools
showed a varying trend, remaining static for primary, increasing by 1% for middle level and
dropping by 1% for secondary level.

PDO Indicator 2: % Increase in: a) Primary NER and GER (Male/Female); b) elementary NER
and GER (male and female); c) Secondary NER and GER (Male/female)

As explained above the programs combined focus on fiscal reforms and maintaining education
budget for key activities allowed the province to show progress achieved in the previous DPC
series, in addition to the above, the program also supported capacity and system improvement to
improve service delivery. A significant achievement of the previous DPC series was recruitment
of more than 49,000 teachers to address student teacher ratios and reduce the number of non-
functional schools; under PEDPC IV the policy for recruitment was further improved resulting in
a plan to hire 34,000 more teachers in 2008/09. The program specially focused on increasing
specialist teachers in middle and secondary schools. PSLM data of 2006/07 collected for both
public and private schools shows a slight improvement in primary gross enrolments for both boys
and girls. The middle school gross enrollment also shows an increasing trend that continues
across 2005/06 through 2007/08. This is especially encouraging for girls' enrollment as it
indicates an increase of approximately 6%. The gross enrollments for secondary level also show
good improvement for both girls and boys, suggesting progress towards achievement of targets
indicated in PEDPC IV. The slow progress in primary enrolments is however a clear indication of
a need to focus program activities on improving access and quality to ensure gains in enrollments
can be sustained over the years.

PDO Indicator 3: Reduction in primary age out of school children
The program anticipated that increasing enrollments and bringing out-of-school children will
require schools to be physically ready. Activities were designed to provide districts with need-
based and performance -based grants to undertake infrastructure improvements, this combined
with policies to support free education, free textbooks, low-cost private schooling and stipends
has contributed to reducing out of school children. Previous assessments of civil works had raised
concerns about slow progress, quality and piecemeal selection of missing facilities in schools.
The program supported the use of external contracting mechanisms to speed up school up-
gradation and rehabilitation work, this not only improved the capacity of the education
department to undertake contracts but also allowed them to focus on whole-school approach to
providing missing facilities. There was a slight reduction in the percentage of primary age (5-9
years old) out of school children from 40% baseline to 38%; however this was still better in
comparison to national averages. There is a continued need to improve district management
capacity to plan, assess and deliver on school improvements in the province.




                                               27
PDO Indicator 4 and 5: a) Improvement in matriculation pass rates; and b) % improvement in
standardized grade V and grade VIII examination results
Student performance improved (using national assessment test results as baseline)
Although quality achievements anticipated in the DPC series could not be quantified in one year
of implementation, however there was good progress made to introduce innovative activities to
improve and measure quality of teaching and learning in schools. Textbooks that are at times the
only learning tool in schools are now out-sourced, the competition allowing the government to
select the best quality books, textbook procurement reforms are still underway in the new PESP
initiative. Efforts were made to strengthen PEC and the results on national assessments were
shared widely to influence policy making. District support cluster centers were developed for 16
districts to provide on-site support for continuous professional development of teachers and the
monthly reports collected by the PMIU indicated an improvement in student attendance and
teacher absenteeism in schools. The CPD program made operational in 12 districts is ongoing;
expansion in other districts is envisaged under PESP after an evaluation of the first phase of
implementation in 12 districts.

Among the intermediate outcome indicators a most significant achievement of the first year was
the increase in PEF funding which increased substantially to Rs. 2.5 billion from a baseline of Rs.
500 million. PEF continues to be recognized as an important activity that is contributing to
improving access and quality of education in underserved areas. The success of PEF can be
contributed to the program's emphasis on regular assessments and documentation of PEF
activities and ensuring that PEF systems follow the highest accountability standards. This has
contributed to the government's acceptance and expansion of this innovative scheme.

A significant contribution of the program in achieving all PDOs has been its focus on monitoring
and evaluation with efficient data collection and analysis at the provincial, district and school
level. This emphasis on data analysis has not only contributed to improved planning, management
and decision making by government but has also raised awareness among all stakeholders about
the situation in schools, especially in the rural areas. The database continues to be used for
teacher incentives, evaluation of district performance


   3. Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
    Rating: The government and implementing agency are the same so the discussion and rating
are given below in section (c).

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
     Rating: Satisfactory

The government showed high ownership and commitment to implement the project at all levels
and across departments. This was demonstrated by instituting crosscutting reforms, both in the
education sector and in public finance, and making considerable progress to improve service
delivery. Monitoring and evaluation system were maintained and analysis was actively used for
decision making and performance monitoring. The Borrower ensured quality at preparation and
implementation and complied with covenants and agreements, ensuring progress toward the
achievement of development objectives.




                                                28
   4. Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
   Rating: Satisfactory
The Bank performance for ensuring quality at entry is rated as satisfactory. The Bank team
remained proactively engaged with the government on the program design, including policy
dialogue, while reinforcing ownership and active participation and consultation of various
stakeholders, from provincial to district government. In addition, project objectives established at
entry remained relevant through implementation and continue to be in line with country priorities
because of sound design focused on addressing key poverty, gender and social development
aspects.

(b) Quality of Supervision
    Rating: Satisfactory
The quality of supervision is rated as satisfactory. The Bank's task team was composed of Human
Development, PREM, Financial Management and Procurement, and Social Assessment staff and
international and national consultants who contributed significantly. The cross sectoral support
was exemplary, with seamless integration of reforms across the various sectors in the project. The
close collaboration with the government during preparation and negotiation continued through
implementation, and ultimately the preparation of the PESP. In addition, strong donor
coordination, notably with DFID, UNICEF, CIDA and GTZ, enabled better alignment of
technical expertise and sources while reduced the reporting burden for the government.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
    Rating: Satisfactory
The Bank team worked closely with the government, proactively engaged in design and
preparation of the project. Strong dialogue with key policy makers was maintained to ensure
quality during implementation. The team, consisting of staff from various sectors of the Bank,
maintained efficient supervision and monitoring of the program. The engagement and close
collaboration ensured a continued dialogue, resulting in the preparation of the PESP.


   5. Institutional Arrangement for Sustainability of Reform Program
   In view of the success of the PESRP World Bank committed continued support for the
   ongoing reform agenda of the Punjab Government. Under the recently signed PESP the World
   Bank agreed to provide $350 million for the next three years. PESP also includes TA
   component that would help build the capacity of the department as well as support
   implementation of the agreed program. The school education department would continue to
   implement its ongoing program with more focus on quality and improved governance in the
   sector.

   In order to ensure effective implementation of PESP a high level provincial steering
   committee under the chairmanship of Chairman P&D Board has been constituted to monitor
   implementation of all activities. PMIU PESRP has also been strengthened to manage and
   implement reforms in financial management and procurement.

   There is high level political and bureaucratic commitment and support for the reform program.
   Both the Bank and the Govt. of Punjab regularly consult each other and maintain strong,
   effective communication links.
