Block 1: Project Description
Background Since the first round of gubernatorial and municipal elections in 1989, Venezuela has been in the process of
transferring responsibilities to the states. Already a large number of functions', including productive enterprises, is being
administered by the State governnents. Recent macroeconomic measures toward fiscal restraint as well as limited resources
and capacity at the state level have prompted the state governments to seek innovative solutions to managing assets and
services. Some of these initiatives mirror reforms at the national level to divest from operating functions and creating ap-
propriate legal and regulatory frameworks. As a result the project strategy is to support: state governments efforts to privat-
ize2 productive assets within consistent national reform strategies. the adoption of normnative/regulatory frameworks in the
transport sector, and the organizational and functional restructuring and institutional strengthening activities of the Ministry
of Transport and Communications (MTC). Substantial progress has been made during prepaLration in the States of Falcon
(three private sector initiatives finalized in the areas of tourism, dams and road tolls) and Sucre (three large initiatives in salt
mines, tourism and ports already completed and one ongoing in airports). The States of Aragua and Mrida. which came on
board more recently, have outlined comprehensive privatization programs. MTC has outlinecd its institutional restructuring
plan and initiated personnel audits to facilitate the process of rationalization. The project, which builds upon the experience
of a Bank region-wide initiative to support subnational governments privatization programs, will make a substantial contn-
bution to the wider Public Sector Reform program being implemented bv the Government.
1. Project development objectives (see Annex I for key performance indicators):
*  Increase efficiency in the delivery of public services and management of state productive enterprises and infrastructure.
and improve the fiscal and financial situation of participating state governments, by promoting private sector participation.
:   Strengthen the national regulatory framework in some transport subsectors, and rationalize existing mistitutional struc-
tures in the national government.
2. Project components (see Annex 2 for a detailed description and Annex 3 for a detailed cost breakdown):

"Exclusive" responsibilities, such as roads, ports, airports and miines, have been assumed by a large proportion of States. "Shared' responsibilities (such as
health, attention to the mninor, attention to the aged, sports, education, nutrition, housing, and culture) are also being transferred although at a slower pace.
2 Within the context of this project, "privatization " should be understood to include any activity that increases pnvate sector, or community-based
and other non-governmental organizations' participation in service delivery, from introduction of conimercial practices, to sub-contracting of non-
core assets and activities, to management contracts and co-management agreements, to concessions, and from partial to full equity privatization.

3. Benefits and target population:
Benefits:
Transferring productive enterprises and transport infrastructure to the private sector, at the state level, will:
*    Transfer investment responsibility to the private sector (i.e. BOT agreements) which will lead to lower public
transfers to public enterprises and stimulate private investment.
*    Increase state governments' sources of revenue (recurrent concession fees on private exploitation of public re-
sources (mines) and infrastructure (airports and ports) or one-time privatization/sale proceeds of e.g. hotels).
*    Improve fiscal outlook of the state budgets and relieve their financial pressures onto the national government.
*    Allow governments to focus on priority public sector activities.
*    W'iden stock ownership through worker and civil participation privatization schemes.
New competition and regulatory frameworks in airports and ports will:
*    Provide the adequate environment for private sector participation.
*    Comply with international norms and regulations.
Target population: State governments, local private sector, transport and other public services users.
4. Institutional and implementation arrangements:
Implementation period: 3 Years
Executing agencies: State Governments of Aragua, Falc6n, and Merida, Ministry of Communications & Transport and
Cordiplan. The State Government of Sucre which is completing its program during preparation will be replaced by an addi-
tional state. appropriately selected.
Project coordination: Cordiplan (see Annex 2 for details)
Project oversight (policy guidance, etc.): Executive Committee of the Ministers of Planning and Transport & Communi-
cations and the Governors of the pilot states.
Transfer of Funds to the States: The National Government will enter into subsidiary agreements with each of the par-
ticipating State governments to transfer to such States part of the funds of the loan from IDB and IBRD's (the Banks) under
terms and conditions to be agreed between the National Government and such States, and will grant them executing author-
ity over the implementation of their respective components.
Accounnng, financial reporting and auditing arrangements: The national PCU will be responsible for maintaining the
accounts of the overall project, while each state PCU will maintain separate accounts for their respective component and
report back to the national PCU on a regular basis. In terms of the specific financial arrangements, the government under-
took a study and action plan to develop institutional and legal alternatives that would improve access to Banks' financing,
including locations and procedures for the special account, subaccounting mechanisms, etc.. On the financial management
system, an assessment wvas undertaken in December 1997 for the TAL for PIID (Ln. 3225-VE) and specific recommenda-
tions produced to make the system consistent with Bank Guidelines. The Government agreed to hire a specialized consul-
tancy to establish a sound financial management system by effectiveness of the proposed loan. Project accounts, financial
statements. the Special Account and the SOEs would be audited annually by independent auditors satisfactory to the Bank.
Audits would be subrnitted to the Bank no later than six months after the end of each fiscal year. To improve management
capacitv in the areas of implementation, contracting, disbursements and financial administration, the Banks will organize a
workshop for both state and national level executing agencies of the project.
Monitoring and evaluation arrangements: The final Borrower Implementation Plan including action plans for each part
of the project were agreed during negotiations. Success will be judged on the basis of clear quantitative (whenever possible)
and qualitative performance/output indicators (number of awarded concession contracts, PEs privatized, approval of com-
petition and regulatorv framework, adoption of institutional framework, etc.). The action plans will be updated annually to
better meet project objectives. Special emphasis was given to first year activities.

Block 2: Project Rationale
5. CAS objective(s) supported by the project                     Document number and date of latest CAS discussion:
ReportNo. 16471-VE, April 8, 1997
*  Promote the development of the private sector outside the oil industry and expand private sector participation in the oil
industrv. Project contribution: infrastructure privatizations at state level, and regulatory framework for the airport and
port sectors.
• Improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the public sector. Project contribution: strengthen state government's su-
pervisorv capacitv, implement the rationalization strategy of the Ministry of Transport and Communications, and
strengthen its regulatory capacity.
6. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
At the subnational government level:
•  Wide-spread public ownership of productive activities. The States of Falc6n and Sucre have engaged in privatization
programs. awvarded concessions of salt mines, ports and roads. and sold tourism facilities. Other states have announced
similar programs.
*  Scarce financial, human and technical resources of the State governments to deliver public services of better quality,
wider coverage, and with greater efficiency. State governments Nvill use their privatization program to reallocate re-
sources towards prioritv public services and promote partnership wvith the private sector f^or their deliverv.
*  Lack of State own sources of revenues. The Association of Governors has been lobbyilg the national government for
legally establishing a State tax base. Otherwise, Governors are establishing a revenue base through concession and user
fees.
* Sustainabilitv of the decentralization effort.
At the national government level:
*  Lag of employment rationalization with respect to transfer and decentralization of functions.
*  National airport system not in compliance with FAA standards and regulations. While the Ministry of Transport and
Communications has developed comprehensive strategy for private sector participation in the sector. implementation
mav have to await the next administrative cycle.
7. Sector issues to be addressed bv the project and strategic choices:
At the subnational government level:
*  Transfer productive enterprises, services, and transport infrastructure to the private sector.
*  Increase States' own sources of revenues through concessioning fees and sale of assets.
* Improve sustainabilitv of the decentralization effort by strengthening State governments' abilitv to monitor and evaluate
contracts.
At the national government level:
*  Support development of regulatorv franework in transport subsectors and strengthen regulatory capacitv.
*  Help functional rationalization efforts in MTC: design and implementation of institutional restructuring plans. area
studies. targeted personnel audits. etc.
* Finance studies to support the wider Public Sector Modernization program of the Government.
8. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:
*  Separating components into two separate projects: components are complementarv, privatization at the state level need
regulatory support at the national level.
*  Restructure existing portfolio rather than initiating new lending: no mechanism exists to support the state governments
directlv. Rather than increasing the number of objectives, components and level of complexitv, existing projects or
components that are underperforming should be canceled.
*  Performance-based human resources management modernization: lack of sufficient commitment from the government
for in-depth legal and institutional reform.

Country: Venezuela                                                Project Title: Public Sector Modemization and Decentraliation
•  Support for continuing the modernization of financial management (phase II of the Integrated Financial Management
and Control System (SIGECOF)): the Government requested a new operation to finance the extension of SIGECOF to
all national public institutions. An existing IDB operation is financing the development of financial management at the
subnational level.
* Comprehensive public sector reform at national level: lack of sufficient implementation capacity and commitment, exis-
tence of other Bank projects, need to stimulate decentralization bottom-up.
9. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design:
General:
* Political and economic opposition can be reduced if large sectors of the public understand the program and the need for
reformn (PCR, Rep. No. 15239). State governors in pilot states have engaged in wide-spreading information campaigns.
*  To promote a structural reform program, some benefits for the public should exist from the beginning. Program design
should take this into account and implement measures which produce early results. (PCR, Report No. 15239) Initial
privatizations have already held some benefits in terms of increased employment and microenterprise creation.
*  Define reasonable, attainable project objectives (QAG Review of PE Reform and Privatization Operations). The project
would be considered a success if it resulted in at least 2 privatization/concession contracts awarded in each of the four
pilot states (which is attainable as the State of Sucre has shown), and a regulatory framework implemented at national
level.
*  Present detailed and rigorous assessment of risks (QAG Review of PE Reform and Privatization Operations). See para.
21.
On private sector development:
•  Government commnitment is the most important factor affecting performance (Annual Review of Evaluation Results
1993. OED. Report No. 13794). Strong commitment frorn State Governors (see para. 11)
-  Review prior in-country experience with PE reform/privatization loans (QAG Review of PE Reform and Privatization
Operations). Experience at the national level was reviewed (Public Sector Enterprise Reform (Ln.3223-VE) and TAL
for PIID). The experience stresses the need for sector rather than enterprise reform. This is addressed in the main sector
of activity (i.e. transport). Assessment performed on the program in the State of Sucre, completed during preparation.
- In the design and implementation of public enterprise reforms, the issue of sector reform should be addressed. At the
same time privatization rather than restructuring should be emphasized (PCR, Report No. 15239) The project com-
bined privatization at the state level with regulatory reform at the national level, and stresses transfer of activities to the
private sector.
- Where privatization is not feasible, alternatives such as leases or management contracts need to be actively explored.
(Lessons & Practices No. 2, OED) See footnote 2 on page2.
On institutional arrangements:
* Draw on specific but adaptable action plans and annual work programs for each component that focus on outputs, de-
fine evaluation criteria and performance indicators to judge project progress (MOP, Report No. P-6740-HO) See para.
4 and Annex 1..
*  Give implementation support for establishing sound criteria and a solid institutional basis for the administration of the
project, especiallv with regard to procurement (MOP, Report No. P-6740-HO).
* Emphasize counterpart responsibilities of the beneficiary agencies and the staffing of key positions (MOP, Rep. No. P-
6740-HO).
On decentralization:
Agreements between the central government and states are important to confirm commitment of all parties involved
(SAR_ Report No. 13474-VE). In the project, subsidiary agreements between the states and the national government are
conditions for disbursement for the respective state component.
10. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership:
The State of Aragua, already advanced in its private sector participation strategy, developed a program to continue effort in
this direction including private sector participation in the airport sector, subcontracting management of specific social and
health institutions, industrial sector participation in technical schools and community management of irrigation svstems.
Agreed to assume responsibility for implementation and sharing financial responsibility.

* The State of Falc6n: developed its privatization program with the active palticipation of the Bank, public enterprises
and the national govermnent (workshops and seminars); established technical unit for coordinating the state privatiza-
tion program; organized privatization training which gathered a large group of State emiployees involved in the reform;
sold two hotels, is preparing to sell two more, entered one toll-road agreement, concessioned a dam, and is preparing the
concession of the ports and of the marble and salt mines. It agreed to assume responsibility for implementation and debt re-
payment.
* The State of Merida: developed a far-reaching and well-focused privatization program with the active participation of
all entities involved. The program encompasses transport (two highways, one port, two airports, one railwav BOT, and the
mass transport svstem for the city of Merida), productive activities (convention center, telepheric. wvholesale market, and free
zone) in addition to other specific activities such as prison administration, rural aqueducts, etc. Agreed to assume responsibilitv
for implementation and debt repayment.
* State of Sucre: successfully implemented its privatization program during project preparation including the Araya salt
mines. the International Fishing Port of Giiiria, ten tourism facilities, established a Superintendency of Privatization to
monitor private sector performance and supervise concession contracts, and contracted the technical and financial advi-
sors for implementing the strategy in the airport sector (ongoing).
* National Government: established Presidential Commnission to Coordinate and Monitor the Restructuring of the Public
Administration; established the Public Sector Reform Executing Unit in Cordiplan, allocated funds from the TAL for
PIID for the preparation of the program, and developed comprehensive strategy for public sector restructuring and
simplification (presented to the Council of Ministers on June 11, 1996). Strong commitment voiced by Minister Petkoff.
The Ministry of Transport and Communications agreed on action plan to restructuring the Ministrv and developing
regulatory framework. This, however, is the weakest link in the project in terms of commitment and implementation ca-
pacity, and was scaled down accordingly.

sioning of public infrastructure will: i) secure revenue streams from the concession fees, or a one-time revenue from priva-
tization. ii) eliminate subsidies to insolvent public enterprises; and iii) transfer responsibility for investment to the private
sector.
Privatization experiences alreadv implemented suggest that substantial gains can be attained both m terns of state
revenues and economic activity. In Sucre, the 25 year concession of the Araya salt mines brought an initial payment of $14
million dollars in revenues to the state government (in addition to yearly flows equal to five percent of revenues for the
length of the concession, increased salt production of the state manv folds, and stimulated the creation of 24 mnicroenter-
prises servicing and subcontracting with the concessionaire (study available upon request)). In. the case of airport infrastruc-
ture, given the low levels of traffic in the regions, gains are mostly expected on the side of increased management efficiency.
In ports, the experience in the Intemational Fishing Port of Guiria (Sucre), which resulted in a $3.6 million transaction and
8 to 12% of revenue vearly flows to the State Govenunent, suggests sizable fiscal and economic gains. In addition, the sale
of small assets, e.g. hotels and beach resorts. although modest in fiscal terms, may have important implications for the local
economy.

14. Institutional Assessment:
a. Executing agencies: The states displav very high commitment levels to the objectives of the reforms, but uneven im-
plementing capacity. Governors' awareness of this capacity shortage has made them very willing to incorporate outside ex-
pertise as a key element of their strategy. This should increase consultants' effectiveness in reaching objectives, but may
affect long-term monitoring capacity of the states. It will be addressed within the context of the project by promoting inde-

pendent sources of revenue for state monitoring agencies possibly through the use of recurrent concession fees. Particular
attention will be given to the State of Falc6n.
The Ministrv of Transport and Communications has limited implementation capacity. For this reason preparation of the
institutional and regulatory frameworks should be contracted in packages to intemational/national legal consortia.
b. Project management: Project implementation capacity of Cordiplan is being addressed within the context of the Port-
folio Improvement Plan agreed with the Government. All PCUs at the state and national levels will benefit from intensive
training on implementation management, procurement, and financial administration.
15. Social Assessment:
The project is expected to have a positive net social impact. Previous privatizations/concessions at state level have
shown an increase in direct (within the firm) and indirect (servicing the industrv) employment, due to increased economic
activity and investment. Wide-ownership programs envisioned in the project would spread capital ownership and retums to
workers and local private sector. Transport infrastructure privatization is expected to have spill-over effects on local tour-
ism activity.
16. Environmental Assessment:         Environmental Category:     []   A           [    B         [41]  C
The project is financing consulting services for general support to privatization programs and regulatory framework de-
velopment. The IDB has financed a study to identify environmental assessment requirements associated with specific initia-
tives. During the implementation of the project, it will be required that any privatization initiative thought to affect the envi-
ronment be accompanied by a thorough environmental assessment.

18. Sustainabilitv:
At the subnational government level:
* Clearly defined privatization projects that have an inherent irreversibility quality to them
* Strong participatorv approach to project design and implementation to increase the prospect for sustainable develop-
ment of services and maintenance of facilities
* Early involvement of relevant actors is meant to respond to local necessities at the design stage, and develop a lasting
partnership that will carry through the implementation stage and bevond
* Explicit effort to include local private sector, workers and civil society as minority partners to main investors will en-
sure long-term social support of privatization policy
* Efforts to increase local capacity, and fiscal independence at the State and municipal government levels are designed to
improve solvencv and sustainability of public services' delivery
At the national government level:
* Establishing legislative and regulatory frameworks and strengthening supervisory and evaluation capacity will improve
sustainabilitv of reforms.

activities in the National Government.
Weak implementation capacity        Substantial The government has been implementing its Portfolio Improvement Plan
agreed with the Bank. and addressing endemic implementation problems.
In this project, great attention has been placed to: i) develop workable
institutional arrangements, ii) support the establishment and strengthen-
ing of technical executing units and the use of long-term consultants, iii)
develop focused training seminars on kev issues (i.e. privatization best
practices, procurement), iv) provide direct technical assistance. v) define
clear and focused objectives and outputs, and vi) diversify executing
agencies. In the pilot states. the Governors have been using their best
resources on the privatization programs due to the fact that benefits
(fiscal) will occur directly to them (not spread across other entities as in
the case of the national government).
Availability of Funds               Moderate  State government counterpart funds do not suffer from the budgetary
problems of the National Government and weight of the project may
limit problems in this area. In both cases, counterpart funds are imputed
from items in the participating entities' normal budget. Furthermore, the

Public Sector Modernization and Decentralization Project
Detailed Project Description
Project Component I - US$ 11.7 million (total cost of component)
Privatization at the State Level. This component, which builds upon the experience of a Bank region-wide initiative to
support subnational governments privatization programs, would support four pilot state governments tailor and execute a
customized strategv for transferring to the private sector productive public enterprises and services, and the construction,
operations and maintenance of transport infrastructure. The best modalities for private sector participation will be applied
on a case-bv-case basis, including concessions, contracting out, sale of assets, etc. While the states mav have privatization
programs of larger scale and sectors' coverage, the assistance will focus on a restricted number of "transactions" in activi-
ties that either do not face regulatorv issues (i.e. competitive enterprises) or where there already exists a national reform
strategy, such as in airports and ports.
Bank support would be channeled towards:
a) Transactions design and implementation. This includes the use of consultant services to prioritize and customize
privatization programs, develop sales strategies, design wide stock-ownership privatization programs, organize
auctions, prepare information sheets, bidding documents and contracts, and assist sale closures.
b) Strengthening the sub-national governments' capacitv to design and implement transactions, monitor contracts,
evaluate performance. and create the supervisory and institutional frameworks that would ensure the sustainabilitv
of the initiatives (consultant services, equipment and training).
The assistance would be managed by each State Coordination Unit, actively supported bv the Private Sector De-
velopment Consulting Team (see Component III).
Tarzer beneficiaries: During preparation, the project supported the States of Falc6n and Sucre. The States of Fal-
c6n, Aragua and M6rida together w ith an additional state (to be selected) will participate in the implementation stage of the
project.
I.     The State of Sucre, in the last stage of implementation of its privatization program, successfullv concessioned the salt
nines of Araya and the Intemational Fishing Port of Guiria. successfully auctioned its tourism infrastructure (10 small
establishments), and is now in the process of concessioning the state airports. The State will continue to be a beneficiary of
the project to strengthen institutional capacity for supervision of contracts. It will also participate in the private sector par-
ticipation dissemination strategy.
II.    Aragua is a state already advanced in its private sector participation strategy, having entered a number of partnerships
with the industrial sector and the community in the management of public services particularly in the areas of education
and social services. This state will require assistance in two areas: one continuing the efforts for private sector participa-
tion in the airport sector, subcontracting management of specific social and heali institutions. industrial sector participa-
tion in technical schools and community management of irrigation systems; the other in the reorganization of the office of
the Governor to establish a strong unit for supervising contracts with the private sector.
III.    The State of Falcon alreadv made some important advances in the imnplementation of its program. After two successful
auctions of tourism assets and the awarding of one toll-road concession, it is now receiving offers for the concessioning of
one of its marble mines, and preparing the strategy for a master concession of the salt mines and of the port in Punto Fijo
(possibly to be concessioned in conjunction with the contiguous free zone).

IV.    The State of Merida developed, a most amnbitious but very well focused privatization program which encompasses trans-
port (two highways, one port, two airports, one railway BOT, and the mass transport system for the citv of MNerida), pro-
ductive activities (convention center, telepheric, wholesale market, and free zone) in addition to other specific activities
such as prison administration, rural aqueducts, etc. The strong capacity of, and support. from, the implementing agencies
should offer a solid base to move quickly on these initiatives.
The participating states would be expected to carry out at least three privatization/concession initiatives in the three-year
implementation cycle. It is hoped that successes in these experiences may set the basis for developing an APL project that
would extend to a number of additional states.
Project Component II - USS 4.6 million (total cost of component)
Reform and Decentralization at the National Government. For state reforms to be viable and sustainable, it is critical to
put in place at the national level adequate technical and economic regulatory frameworks in prioritv subsectors (e.g., air-
ports and ports), develop sufficient supervisory capacity, and ensure consistencv of individual initiatives with overall na-
tional objectives. Within the context of the Government's Public Sector Reform Program. this component would support
reforms at the national government level that will actively complement state governments' initiatives in the area of increased
private sector participation, as well as help the national government to prepare two major concessions in airport infrastruc-
ture.
Bank assistance will be directed to: i) institutional strengthening of supervisorv, regulatorv and evaluation functions
and project management; ii) developing normative and regulatorv frameworks to strengthen competition with emphasis on
transport subsectors (e.g., airports and ports) reflecting the privatization priorities of both states and national governments;
and iii) institutional restructuring studies and personnel audits to streamline operative functions and determine retrenchment
needs and costs. The Bank will also provide limited policy assistance to the wider Public Sector Modernization Program of
the Government for carrying out institutional studies of the public sector. This is expected to provide the basis for continued
policy dialogue, and a vehicle for preparing a potential follow-up project.
Sutbcomponent II.A. Ministry of Transport & Communications (MTC). MTC is key to supporting prioritv initia-
tives in the states as well as urgent reforrns at the national level in the airport sector. Not onlv has MTC decentralized roads.
ports and airports operations to the states (18 out of 22 states have absorbed all or some of these functions) but the states
are also keen in transferring the operation of this infrastructure to the private sector. The pr.oject will assist MTC in imple-
menting its rationalization strategy, strengthening its regulatorv capacity, and putting in place consistent regulatory and
competition frameworks in specific subsectors.
Subcomponent II.B. Institutional restructuring studies to support the wider Public Sector Modernization Program
of the government. These studies will provide policy guidance for continuing efforts to rationalize the public sector and the
process of decentralization. They mav also provide the basis for the design of a follow-up oiperation.
Project Component III - US$ 3.5 million (total cost of component)
Project Coordination and Implementation Assistance. The Project Coordinating Unit (PCU), based in Cordiplan. would
be in charge of project coordination under the guidance of an Executive Conmmittee integrated by the Ministers of Planning
and of Transport & Communications, and the Governors of the participating states. The Unit would support and monitor
progress of the reform, oversee contract completion, track disbursements, prepare semi-armual progress reports, and provide
assistance to the Banks supervision missions. It would be staffed bv the Project Coordinator, and a Chief Financial Admin-
istrator, and supported by two professional teams of consultants in the areas of private sector development and public sector
modemization.

The Private Sector Development Consulting Team would count with four professional staff, including a team
leader, a legal/institutional expert, and two generalists, one focusing on economic and financial aspects, and one on social
and participatory aspects. It would work across participating states to provide direct technical support in the development
and implementation of their respective privatization program. This would require a close collaboration between the team and
the States' Coordination Units in all stages of transactions' management in the areas of privatization, concessions and out-
sourcing in. including an active involvement in the preparation of the general guidelines, workplan, timetable for implemen-
tation. and terms of reference for hiring of investment banks and consultant firms. The Team would also organize and de-
liver the assistance to strengthen the states' supervision and monitoring capacityv and lead dissemination seminars in other
states to set the basis for future assistance. The Team would report to Cordiplan but maintain autonomy on technical issues.
Each pilot state would set up a State Coordinating Unit, staffed by a local coordinator and a chief administrator, in
charge of supporting implementation and maintaining the accounts of their respective component. These units would be re-
sponsible for regularly reporting their financial accounts to the PCU in Cordiplan. The states would also define the institu-
tional arrangements to house the functions of supervision and monitoring of contracts, which will receive the assistance in
these areas. In the case of Sucre, a Superintendency was created to supervise governmental concessions and contracts.
The Public Sector Modernization Consulting Team would count with three professional staff, including a Team
Leader and two specialist, one on public sector reform and one on infrastructure. The Team would help coordinate the sec-
ond component of the program, providing analytical support to MTC, and managing the development of institutional re-
structuring and other public sector modernization studies.
In the Ministrv of Transport and Communications, the Planning Unit would be in charge of the management of the
project. The Unit would be responsible for implementing the overall strategy, and preparing TORs and contracts for the
development of the institutional and regulatory reforms.

Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements
Procurement
Procurement methods (Table A)
Procurement will be the responsibility of the PCU in CORDIPLAN and the Executing Units in each state. Their
capacity was assessed during appraisal and workshops were planned to enhance their skills. All procurement of goods will
be done in accordance with the provisions of Section I of the 'Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA
Credits' dated January 1995 and revised in January and August 1996 and September 1997. Goods estimated to cost
S250.000 equivalent or more shall be procured through LIB. Goods with contract values below $250,000 shall be procured
through international shopping.
Consultants' services to be provided by firms will be selected in accordance with the quality-and cost-based selec-
tion procedures set forth in the 'Guidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers', dated
January 1997 and revised in September 1997. Individual consultants will be employed for assignments which do not re-
quire teams of personnel, and when the experience and qualifications of the individual are the paramount requirement.
Prior review thresholds (Table B)
The procurement of all goods will be subject to the Bank's prior review. The selection of consulting firms and in-
dividual consultants for assigmnents costing the equivalent of US$100,000 and 50,000 or more, respectively, will be subject
to the Bank's prior review; for contracts below those amounts, the Bank will have to approve ex-ante only the terms of refer-
ence for the respective assignments.
Disbursement
Allocation of loan proceeds (Table C)
Disbursement will be made over a three year period. a shorter than average implementation period which is rea-
sonable given the pilot nature of the project. Table C presents the expected disbursement by category. Fifty-two percent of
consulting services and eighty-six percent of good purchases are expected to be local. The project is expected to be com-
pleted by September 30, 2001. The closing date for the proposed loan will be March 3 1, 2002.
'se of statements of expenses (SOEs):
The Borrower will use Statements of Expenditure (SOEs) for contracts below $100,000 in the case of procurement
of goods, and below $100,000 and $50,000 respectively for the contracting of firms and individual consultants. The Bor-
rower will maintain separate records of amounts withdrawn through SOEs and retain independent auditors to give an opin-
ion on the adequacy of documents and controls on the use of SOEs.
Special account:
In order to expedite the loan disbursements, a special account with an authorized allocation of US$ 800,000 may be
established in the Central Bank of Venezuela on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank. The initial deposit will be
limited to US$ 200,000 until disbursement from the loan reaches US$ 600,000. For replenishment of the special accounL
the Borrower will furnish request for deposits at such intervals as the Bank will specify. Prior to each request the Borrower
w ill submit the documents and other evidence for the payments for which replenishment is requested. During negotiations,
it was agreed that mechanisms will be established to ensure Cordiplan has timely access to the account.

Financial Management
The Project Coordinating Unit in CORDIPLAN will be responsible for overall financial management of the proj-
ect, although each state unit will maintain separate accounts and transfer information periocically to Cordiplan. The Units
will contract personnel qualified in financial administration and procurement, establish sound financial management sys-
tems including adequate accounting, budgeting and reporting, ensure appropriate internal control mechanisms, and contract
independent auditors satisfactory to the Bank to undertake the annual audits of all project accounts, financial statements, the
Special Account and the SOEs.
A financial management assessment (on file) was undertaken in December 1997 for a project managed by
Cordiplan (TAL for PIID Ln. 2335-VE) and specific recommendations produced to make the system consistent with Bank
Guidelines. During technical discussions, the Government agreed to hire a specialized consultancy to establish a sound fi-
nancial management system by effectiveness for the proposed project.
Accounting information submitted to the Bank should comply with the accounting standards of the Bank. To do
this all Coordinating Units in the project will have established acceptable accounting and internal control systems to timely
record all financial transactions of the project and provide sufficient financial information to monitor project activities. The
PCU in Cordiplan will have the responsibility to provide to the Bank within six months after the end of each fiscal year, an-
nual audited financial statements. Unaudited statements may be required by the Bank duiing the course of the year for
monitoring purposes.
Auditing arrangements will have to be made in accordance with standards acceptable to the Bank. The auditing
,will include an assessment of the quality of the accounting and internal control systems, and of whether adequate documen-
tation was maintained, and a verification of the expenditures submitted. It will be the Borrower's responsibility to ensure
that independent auditors are contracted in time.
