THIRD BOGOTA WATER SUPPLY, SEWERAGE
AND DRAINAGE PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Colombia has requested Bank financial assistance
for the expansion of water supply distribution facilities, extension and
improvement of sewerage services and construction of storm water drainage
facilities in the capital city of Bogota. The project was prepared by the
Empresa de Acueducto y Alcantarillado de Bogota (EAAB), which is the
city-owned authority responsible for the provision of sanitary and drainage
services in Bogota. The total estimated cost of the project is US$62.7
million, and a Bank loan of US$30.0 million is recommended to cover its
foreign exchange component. The Borrower and Beneficiary would be EAAB
which has been the recipient of two previous Bank loans and is a well
managed and financially sound public utility. Construction of the project
components will be completed during the four year period 1979-1982. The
project was appraised in October 1978 and found to be technically and
economically justified and suitable for a Bank loan.
II. THE SECTOR
A. Country Background
Physical Features
2.01      Colombia has an area of 1.14 million km2 and is characterized by
high mountain ranges running south to north in the west central part of the
country and tropical plains in the north and east. Although it is on the
equator, as a result of high altitudes in the mountains, Colombia has a wide
range of climates, but about 70% of the country is hot and rainy. In the
eastern half of the country where most,of the population resides, annual
rainfall exceeds 1,600 mm. There are three major river basins with numerous
tributaries which cover about 90X of Colombia's land area, of which the Rio
Magdalena Basin which parallels the south-north mountain ranges is the most
significant as it provides potable and irrigation water in the heavily
populated portions of the countriy (see map, page 97).
Population
2.02      The population of Colombia in mid-1978 was estimated to be
25.7 million 1/. It is growing at an estimated rate of 2.8% p. a., down
significantly from the rate of 3.2% p. a. which prevailed in the early
1/   Departamento Administrativo Nacional de Estadistica (DANE).



-2-
1960s 1/. Of the total population, about 61% live in communities of 2,500
inhabitants or more, defined as urban population for sector purposes. The
urban population is growing at an annual rate of 4.5%, down from 6.0% in
the early 1960s. The rural population (39.0% of the total) is estimated to
be growing at 1.0% p. a., reversing the trend of negative population growth
in rural areas which occurred during the 1960s, In contrast with other Latin
American countries of comparable size and deveCopment, Colombia has several
large urban centers. The population of Bogota, the capital city9 is about
3.8 million, Medellin, 1.3 million, Cali, 1.1 million and Barranquilla, 0.8
million, and there are 18 cities with populations ranging from 0.1 to 0.4
million inhabitants. Recent estimates of the rates of net migration indicate
that the predominantly urban orientation of migration will continue at
present levels to those cities which have the best employment opportunities,
and this will create an increasing demand for public services. By 1990, it
is projected that urban residents will account for about three-fourths of
Colombia's total population.
Economic and Health Indicators
2.03      Per capita income in Colombia in 1977 was estimated at US$660.
Income distribution is highly skewed with the lowest quintile receiving only
5% of the national income. It is estimated that about 34% of the urban
residents are below the urban poverty income threshold of US$220 per capita.
2.04      The health situation in Colombia is satisfactory. Calorie intakes
exceed requirements for the country overall, although there are deficiencies
for some low-income groups. There is one physician for every 2,230 inhabitants,
which is better than the average for middle-income countries, and medical
services are available to about 65% of the population. Life expectancy at
birth is 61, compared with 58 for middle-income countries in general, and
the crude death rate is 8 per thousand versus 12 per thousand for middle-
income countries 2/. Diarrheal diseases, which are closely related to sanita-
tion, are still the third largest cause of death in Colombia 3/, whereas for
23 of 34 other Latin American countries the disease is not among the first
five causes of death. Although infant mortality has decreased from 75 per
thousand in 1969 to 50 per thousand in 1976, diarrhea and enteritis are
the number one cause of infant deaths and in recent years have remained
relatively unchanged at an index slightly over 10 per thousand 4/.
1/   In June 1978 DANE undertook a household survey which indicated a crude
birth rate of 29.1 per 1,000 population for the country as a whole,
and rates of 25.0 and 35.9 for urban and rural areas respectively.
Based on the country's average crude death rate of 8 per 1,000 popula-
tion, the resulting overall population growth rate in 1978 was 2.1%
p.a. It is expected that the apparent lower population growth rate
in recent years will result in a downward revision of Colombia's
present population estimate.

100,000 inhabitants.

B. Water Resources and Management
2.05      In general, high quality water resources for urban and rural water
supply are ample. Colombia's population is concentrated in areas of moderate
to high rainfall and adjacent to rivers and tributaries. There is, however,
a seasonal pattern to the rainfall which requires storage to provide water
to some urban areas during the dry season. With proper storage, Colombia's
water resources are expected to meet potable water requirements well into the
twenty-first century. At present, there are no problems with the allocation
of water for domestic consumption which has traditionally been given the
highest priority.
2.06      Responsibility for managing the multiple uses of water sources in
Colombia is shared by different institutions as follows:
(a) Planning: National Planning Office (DNP);
(b) Survey, design and development: Colombia Institute of
Hydrology and Land reclamation and three regional develop-
ment institutions; and
(c) Administration: National Institute for Renewable Natural
Resources and regional development authorities.
Waste Disposal
2.07      Sewage and industrial wastes are largely untreated, and in some
cases the loads have reached or exceeded the capacities of the rivers to
absorb them. The situation is particularly critical in rivers downstream
from the major cities of Bogota, Medellin and Cali. The Government and
regional and local authorities are aware of the situation, and programs are
underway to require industries and municipalities to control pollution.
C. Sector Organization
2.08      Overall sector planning for the water supply and sewerage sector
in Colombia is the responsibility of the Ministry of Public Health in co-
ordination with DNP. Responsibility for the implementation of national
policies rests with the Instituto de Fomento Municipal (INSFOPAL) and the
Instituto Nacional de Salud (INAS) in urban and rural areas, respectively.
In addition, there are other institutions linked to the sector, the most
important of which are the regional development institutions (para. 2.06)
which promote the socioeconomic development of regions, have authority over
regional resources, including water, and have responsibility for protecting
the environment.
2.09      Until the end of 1975, INSFOPAL had direct responsibility for
planning, financing, constructing, and operating water and sewer systems in
municipalities with over 2,500 population, excluding a few large municipal
authorities. Under decrees issued in December 1975 and June 1976, which were
designed to decentralize the sector, INSFOPAL assumed responsibility for
financing and general supervision of the water supply and sewerage sector



-4-
for authorities in all communities over 2,500 in population 1/. Regional
and municipal authorities were given executing responsibility for design,
construction and operation of water supply and sewerage systems under
INSFOPAL's guidance. At the present time, INSFOPAL is in the process of
restructuring its organization and redefining its relationships and respon-
sibilities. Because of inadequate manpower in the regional and municipal
authorities, INSFOPAL has found it difficult to delegate project preparation
and construction activities, and at the present time the decentralization
envisioned in the decrees is not working satisfactorily. Sector development
for communities of less than 2,500 inhabitants is the responsibility of INAS.
2.10      The direct responsibility for supplying water supply and sewerage
services is vested in four categories of institutions. Two are supervised
by INSFOPAL, Empresas de Obras Sanitarias (EMPOS) which have regional or
municipal jurisdiction and Empresas Publicas Municipales (EPMs) which pro-
vide services for individual cities. In many cases the EPMs, in addition
to providing water supply and sewerage services, are responsible for
telecommunications, electric power, slaughterhouses, public markets and
solid waste disposal. In those EMPOS and EPMs where INSFOPAL has provided
financing, it supervises operations, financial performance, and new construc-
tion. The third category of operating authority is INAS, which provides
water supply and sewerage services, or alternative excreta disposal facilities,
to small communities directly through its regional branches or decentralized
regional health agencies. Finally, there are authorities serving municipali-
ties which are not linked to any national sector institution.
D. Service Levels
2.11      Availability of water supply and sewerage services in Colombia
ranks among the highest in Latin America. It is estimated that at the end of
1977, about 73% of the urban population had access to potable water through
house connections and about 60% were connected to sewerage systems. Service
levels in the rural areas were lower, with about 40% of the rural population
having access to water supplies through house connections and about 12% having
access to wastewater disposal systems. For the most part, the urban dwellers
who are not served with piped water and sewerage constitute the lower income
population. Service levels are shown in Table 2.1 below:
1/   Water authorities in the cities of Bogota, Medellin, Cali and Palmira,
have not relied on INSFOPAL for financing and have traditionally
operated autonomously.

1977                             73.3         40.3        60.5

1977                             60.2         12.1        41.5
Source: INSFOPAL.
2.12      The percentage of total population served with piped water increased
from 50.7% in 1970 to 60.5% in 1977. Sector data indicate that this increase
was the result of a significant rise in the percentage of rural population
served offset by a small decrease in the percentage of urban population
served. However, some of the communities with public water systems that were
defined as urban in 1970 are now defined as rural, which could account for the
reported decline in urban service levels. The extent to which the decline is
real reflects the rapid migration from the rural areas to the cities.
2.13      The percentage of total population served with sewerage in 1977
was similar to that for 1970 (41%). This appears to be the result of an
increase in coverage in rural areas and a decrease in urban areas, but the
differences may be accounted for by the changes in definition of urban and
rural population between 1970 and 1977.
E. Service Standards
2.14      Water supply is provided through house connections, with public
standpipes only being used as an interim measure. According to a recent
analysis made by DNP, of those served with piped water in urban areas, about
61% received water which had been fully treated. The remaining 39% received
water which had been partially treated by chlorination, or not treated at all.
Sector authorities are aware of the dangers of untreated water and plan to
provide adequate treatment to all water supplies in conformity with national
water quality standards. There is no information available to allow assessment
of the quality of water supplied in rural areas, although legal provisions
require compliance with national water quality standards.
2.15      Waste disposal services are provided in urban areas by sanitary or
combined sewerage/storm drainage systems. In rural areas, where the density
of population is lower, alternative systems such as septic tanks, latrines
and other individual waste disposal systems are widely used.

F. Sector Objectives
2.16      Government objectives for the decade 1970-1980 are to provide water
supply to 80% of the urban population and to 50% of the nondispersed rural
population (centers with more than 200 inhabitants), and sewerage services
to 70% of the urban population and to 50% of the rural population. It appears
unlikely that the 1980 objectives for water supply in urban or rural areas
will be met, and objectives for sewerage in both urban and rural areas will
not be attained until well into the 1980s. A major constraint has been lack
of financial resources, as internal cash generation has fallen short of the
levels expected. Government funds and foreign loans have not been sufficient
to meet the gap between available internally-generated funds and investment
requirements. There have also been managerial and technical staffing con-
straints which have retarded sector development, especially in medium and
small-size cities and rural areas.
2.17      By 1990 the Government plans to provide piped water to 90% of the
urban population and 80% of the rural nondispersed population. Sewerage
service level goals are 80% and 55%, respectively. The Government has ex-
plicitly recognized the need to expand services to the low-income population
and expects to make services affordable by cross-subsidization from higher
income consumer groups. The service level objectives for the next decade
are presented in Table 2.2 below:

2.18      The Government has prepared a general investment plan for the sector
with departmental priorities based on population, geographical status, level
of existing services, and estimated per capita investment requirements. In
the rural areas, community interest expressed by willingness to contribute a
percentage of investment costs and a commitment to operate and maintain the
services is a factor in determining investment priorities.
2.19      There are three additional objectives which the Government has for
the sanitation sector. One is to improve management practices in water and
sewerage authorities and in INSFOPAL and INAS. Another is to establish
financial policies which will make the authorities financially viable and
which will ensure a reasonable level of self-financing of investment programs.
The last is to reduce river pollution which is seriously affecting health,
fisheries and agriculture downstream from major cities.
2.20      Sector objectives for 1990 are attainable provided the Government
takes measures to increase internally-generated funds, allocates a larger
share of its development budget to the sector and is successful in obtaining
the required external financing. The major constraint for sector devel-
opment apart from funding, appears to be the absorptive capacity of the
executing entities, especially in the case of small cities and rural areas.
Institutional improvement programs to assist in reducing this constraint are
being developed with the aid of international agencies, including the Bank.
Of particular significance is a revised manpower training program being
undertaken by INSFOPAL.
G. Sector Finances
2.21      At the present time many, if not most, of Colombia's water author-
ities are in poor financial condition as a result of unrealistically low
tariffs.  The Government's long-run financial objectives for the sector are
to have each authority set tariffs at levels which will at a minimum recover
operating and financial costs. At the same time, however, tariff structures
must subsidize low-income consumers, therefore providing for income redistri-
bution.
2.22      Sector investment during the next three years is expected to
average US$100 million annually, of which about 60% will be accounted for by
Bogota, Cali and Medellin, 32% by INSFOPAL, and 8% by INAS. It is expected
that these investments will be financed 50% from external sources, 35% from
the National Treasury (loans and equity) and 15% from internal cash generation
of the authorities and local loans. While it would be desirable to have
a larger share of capital expenditures financed from internal cash generation,
the required tariff increases for many water utilities would be too large
to be feasible. Long-range annual investments will have to increase, parti-
cularly to meet sewage service level objectives and to reduce river pollution.
Accordingly, the Government's financial commitment to the water supply and
sewerage sector will have to be increased, and in this regard a detailed
long-range sector investment program with associated financing commitments
would be desirable.

2.24    Bank lending to the sector encompasses water supply and sewerage in
the capital city, the third largest city (Cali), and 16 medium-size cities.
In addition to the loans to water utilities, the Bank in 1978 made a loan
for the Urban Development Project (1558-CO) which included water supply
components for 23 cities. The Bank's participation in the sector is consistent
with the Government's policy of improving the service levels in the capital
city, which is below that of the other large cities, and of providing better
service in the secondary cities to encourage more balanced urban development.
In 1977 the Bank extended its sector participation into rural areas through
the Integrated Rural Development Project (Loan 1352-CO) which included a water
supply component of US$3.2 million and the Integrated Nutrition Improvement
Project (Loan 1487-CO) which included US$1.7 million for water supply.
Agriculture Loans 849-CO and 1163-CO also included small water suppply compo-
nents. The Bank's lending objectives of participation in a broad cross-section
of the sector and the provision of assistance for institutional improvements
are being achieved by the lending program.

III. POPULATION, SECTOR SERVICES AND DEMAND
IN THE PROJECT AREA
A. Project Location
3.01      The project is located in Bogota, which is the capital of Colombia.
Bogota is situated on a high plain known as the "Sabana de Bogota" at 40 36' North
and 740 05' West, on the easternmost of the three parallel branches of the
Andes Mountain Chain which run south-north through Colombia. Its altitude is
2,600 m above sea level and its climate is cool and fairly uniform throughout
the year, with an annual average temperature of 13.60C. Annual rainfall varies
from 1,000 to 1,500 mm for different sections within the Plain.
B. Population
3.02      Bogota's population was estimated to be 3.8 million in October 1978,
accounting for about 15% of the total population of Colombia and 24% of the
urban population. Since 1970, Bogota's population has been growing at a
rate of 5.8% p. a., primarily reflecting heavy immigration from the rural
areas. The Municipal Government expects the present rate of population
increase to continue and forecasts a population of 5.0 million in 1983 on
completion of the project, and 7.4 million in 1990.
C. Regional Development Prospects
3.03      Bogota is the principal administrative, financial, commercial, indus-
trial, cultural and educational center of Colombia. Its cool, even climate,
above average employment opportunities (its unemployment rate is about 60% of
the national average) and ample space for expansion indicate that Bogota has
excellent development prospects. The availability of large and favorably
located water resources for both water supply and electric power generation
are important factors which will contribute to Bogota's long-term growth.
3.04      In 1972 a team of consultants prepared a "Study of Urban Develop-
ment of Bogota" which set forth the broad parameters of development for
Bogota until the year 1990 and made recommendations for least-cost investment
programs to meet public sector infrastructure and service requirements. The
basic elements of the development strategy outlined in the study were incor-
porated in 1975 into a General Development Plan for Bogota, which is loosely
being followed by the various city government agencies and authorities. The
development plan of Bogota's water supply and sewerage authority, EAAB, is
consistent with the general plan and is being implemented with the objective
of providing water and sewerage services to most of the population within the
sanitary perimeter 1/.
1/   The sanitary perimeter is extended periodically to encompass Bogota's
expanding population.



- 10 -
D.   Sector Agencies
3.05      The two principal agencies involved in the project are EAAB and the
Corporacion Autonoma Regional de la Sabana de Bogota y de los Valles de Ubate y
Chiquinquira (CAR), which has responsibility for water resource management and
pollution control on the Bogota Plain. EAAB will be responsible for project
construction and the sewerage feasibility studies and CAR for the feasibility
studies for the rectification of the Bogota River, in cooperation with EAAB
and Empresa de Energia Electrica de Bogota (EEEB). EAAB and CAR have a satis-
factory working relationship and have reached agreement on the respective
responsibilities for the project components.
E.   Existing Systems
Water Resources
3.06      Bogota's water resources are abundant and favorably located.  The
Bogota River and its tributaries provide the city with a normal yield of
11.6 m3/sec. The Bank-financed Chingaza Project, 45 km east of the city,
will make available 14 m3/sec in 1981 and will have an ultimate yield of
22 m3/sec. Additional schemes in Sumapaz and Suarez will provide 40 m3/sec
and it is expected that the combined water sources will meet Bogota's require-
ments up to the year 2025.
3.07      The surface water currently collected for the supply of Bogota is
of good quality, requiring only standard treatment. The new source from
Chingaza will be of excellent quality, requiring only simple treatment.
There is some groundwater in the Plain, but the quality is poor and the
quantity is barely sufficient to supply some small towns and to irrigate
small areas in the Plain.
Water Supply
3.08      Water used for domestic and industrial water supply is subsequently
utilized for power generation downstream from Bogota after being returned to
the Bogota River. There is no major conflict in the use of water in the
Plain. CAR works in a joint commission with EAAB and EEEB to coordinate
releases from the regulating impounding reservoirs. Priority of the use of
water for human consumption is recognized by the bylaws of CAR.
3.09      Bogota's water supply now comes from the Bogota River and its tri-
butaries (Figure 3.1). In the initial stages of development the system
was supplied by small tributaries of the Bogota River that were close to the
urban area. These tributaries are still utilized and the water is treated
in the San Diego and Vitelma Treatment Plants. Subsequently, water from a
more distant tributary, the Tunjuelo River, was tapped and diverted to the
Vitelma Plant, and in 1956 direct abstraction from the Bogota River became
necessary. The intake was selected at Tibito, about 35 km north and upstream

of the city to obtain less contami3ated water. The first stages of the
Tibi5o Treatment Plant were of 4 m /sec capacity, and the plant was expanded to
12 m /sec in 1976 as a part of the project financed by Loan 536-CO.  Cur 5ently
some additional works are under execution to facilitate the flow of 12 m /sec.
The diversion wo5ks from Chingaza and the new El Sapo Treatment Plant with a
capacity of 14 m /sec are expected to be completed in early 1981 and will
provide a new source of supply.  At the present t me Bogota has sufficient
water supply and treatment plant capacity (13.6 m /sec) to meet demand until
1981 when the principal supply point for the system will be shifted to El Sapo
because of its lower treatment costs and gravity delivery to the city as
opposed to pumped delivery from Tibito.
3.10      Bogota's water distribution system is divided into three zones
determined by altitude of which the low zone supplied from Tibito is the
largest, accounting for about 70% of the city. The intermediate zone
forms a narrow strip between the two other zones representing about 10%
of the city area. This zone is also supplied from Tibito, but the water
has to be boosted at Usaquen. The high zone, representing about 20% of
the area of the city, is supplied by the Vitelma and San Diego Treatment
Plants and other minor sources. The demand in this last zone has increased
considerably because of the connection to this zone of the networks in
"barrios populares" 1/ executed as a part of the project financed by
Loan 741-CO. At present it is necessary to reinforce the supply to this
zone by pumping water from the Tibito system.
3.11      The total length of Bogota's distribution system is 4,200 km
including the two transmission lines from Tibito (78" and 60").  Pipes with
a diameter of below 14" account for 94% of the total. The normal materials
for pipes are galvanized iron for those with a diameter of 3" or less,
asbestos cement for diameters of 4" to 12" and concrete for most of the
pipes of 24" and abSve. The capacity of the public water storage in the
system is 334,000 m , the major part of which is located in the low zone.
Sewerage and Storm Water Drainage
3.12      About 30% of the area of Bogota, predominantly the older sections
of the city, has a combined sewerage/storm water drainage system, and the
remainder has separate systems. The sewerage and storm water drainage system
is divided into four main sectors, which correspond to the natural drainage
basins of the Bogota River's tributaries (Figure 3.2). The Torca, Salitre,
Fucha and Tunjuelo streams flow from the east to the west through the city
and discharge into the Bogota River. EAAB's sewerage and drainage master plan
provides for the canalization (large open drainage channels) of these four
streams and the construction of parallel sanitary interceptors to collect
sewage now discharged into the streams inside the sanitary perimeter.

3.13      The limited hydraulic capacity of the Bogota River, which is the
ultimate drainage channel for the whole Plain, prevents the full discharge
of stormwater and sewage from Bogota when the flow of the River is above
normal, causing frequent flooding of low-lying areas of the Plain (Figure 3.2).
The Tunjuelo Stream floods in its middle reaches during its peak flow
stage, while the other streams flood closer to their confluence with the
Bogota River. The limited flow of the Bogota River is also inadequate to
absorb the untreated sewage from Bogota and various industries located out-
side the city limits.  The oxygen content in the Bogota River downstream from
Bogota has been depleted, creating a septic condition that is a source of
nuisance for the population living near the water course and is a serious
sanitary hazard for towns along the River. The possibility of rapid reoxygena-
tion, which would normally take place in the Bogota River downstream from Bogota,
where the river falls 1,800 m in a 25 km stretch, is in great measure impaired
because most of the water is diverted through tunnels and penstocks which
feed an electric power generating station on the lower Plain. The condition
in which the Bogota River water reaches the Magdalena River may soon endanger
the fishery industry in that river. Both the flooding and pollution situation
were studied to the pre-feasibility level under Loan 741-CO, and will be
studied to the feasibility level under the proposed loan (paras. 5.13-5.16).
The principal components of the existing water, sewerage and drainage systems
are illustrated in the Map and described in Annex 1.
Evaluation
3.14      The water, sewerage and drainage systems have been well conceived
with sufficient extra capacity for expansion and well constructed under
fairly high design standards. The operational effectiveness of the system
is satisfactory, with the exception of the system's ecological situation
created by the discharge of raw sewage to open water courses.
F. Population Served and Service Standards
Socioeconomic Indicators
3.15      It is estimated that 1.5 million of Bogota's 3.8 million inhabitants,
or 39%, may be classified as urban poor, with annual family incomes of US$1,200
or less (para. 7.12). The crude birth rate of about 25 per 1,000 is the same
as the overall urban crude birth rate which is below the national average of
29 per 1,000 1/. Due to the absence of tropical diseases, health conditions
are generally better than the national average, with a death rate of 5.7 per
1,000 inhabitants versus 8.0 for Colombia. However, infant mortality is 74
per 1,000 live births, which is above the national average of 50.
Service Standards
3.16      In 1978, EAAB provided water supply to 3.2 million persons, which
represented about 86% of Bogota's population. The areas not supplied are
generally new settlements of low-income population principally outside the
1/   DANE Household Survey, June 1978.



- 15 -
sanitary district perimeter. Those individuals not connected to the EAAB
system are served by standpipes or obtain water from surface or groundwater
sources. EAAB's supply has fully met demands of connected consumers and has
provided highly reliable 24-hour per day service during the past decade.
3.17      Treated water quality is good and the quality is maintained in the
distribution system which is pressurized at all times. Water turbidity is
between 1.5 to 2 units, the color is between 8 and 10 units, the ph between
7 to 7.5, and alkalinity 15 to 20 mg/l. Hardness is around 30 mgr/lt. In
general, it fulfills the requirements of international standards. The
bacteriological quality is controlled regularly and B Coliform and plate
count results show that the water meets public health standard requirements.
Composition of Consumption
3.18      Per capita consumption of water in Bogota is estimated at present
to be 196 lcpd, down from 217 lcpd in 1970 reflecting primarily the fact that
many of the new consumers connected to the system were low-income families
with consumption below the system average. About 66% of consumption is
accounted for by residences, 27% by commercial and industrial users, and 7%
by government. Consumption of low-income families using standpipes or not
connected to the EAAB system is well below the average because of lack of
water-borne sanitary facilities and sewerage connections.
Metering
3.19      Water production is measured at the treatment plants and water sales
are metered at all consumers' connections. The only exception to the latter
are about 400 standpipes, which account for about 0.3% of consumption. After
completion of a leak detection and repair program in 1975, unaccounted-for
water was only 22% of water production. It appears to have increased substan-
tially in 1977 and 1978 (to 27% and 33%, respectively), but this is in part
due to understated water sales as a result of a meter readers' strike. Based
on estimated normal per capita consumption of 196 lcpd, unaccounted-for water
amounted to 26% of production in 1978. The increase since 1975 has resulted
from a combination of factors, including unreliable production meters, insuffi-
cient maintenance personnel, increased illegal connections and increased
operating pressures to supply the expanding networks. Measures to correct
these deficiencies are now underway, including meter replacement, strengthen-
ing the leak-detection section, increasing maintenance personnel and metering
of standpipes.
Sewerage
3.20      About 80% of Bogota's population is served by direct connections to
EAAB's sewerage system. The remainder of the population, located mainly out-
side the sanitary district perimeter, is served by septic tanks or private
or community provisional drains discharging into ditches or small streams. The
principal deficiency of the sewerage system is that there is no treatment and
all sewage is ultimately discharged into surface waters. In the more developed
areas EAAB has constructed interceptors parallel to the surface water courses
to collect the sewage discharges and improve sanitary conditions. The sewage



- 16 -
development program for the next decade contemplates extension of existing
interceptors to the limit of the sanitary perimeter, with the exception of
the Salitre interceptor where the backflow from the high waters of the Bogota
River extends well inside the perimeter, and construction of sewage and
treatment plants.
Urban Poor
3.21      It is estimated that in 1978 64% of the 1.5 million Bogota inhabi-
tants classified as urban poor (para. 3.15) were connected to the EAAB water
supply system and 51% to the sewerage networks. Those not served are gener-
ally in areas of low population density inside the sanitary perimeter, or
outside the perimeter where EAAB does not provide service. Once a barrio is
established and is willing to advance 30% of the cost of the water distribution
and sewage collection networks, EAAB will provide service. The individual
connection fees to the poor are low and may be repaid over an extended period
along with the monthly water and sewerage bills. Furthermore, the tariff
structure provides large cross-subsidies to the low-income consumer (para.
6.10). Thus both connections to the water and sewage system and monthly
service charges are affordable to the urban poor. The standards of service to
the urban poor through individual house connections are the same as for other
consumers in the system.
G. Demand Projections
Water Supply
3.22      Projected water demand has been derived from the expected population
growth (para. 3.02), EAAB's planned increase in service levels, and existing
per capita consumption of 196 lcpd. The planned increases in service levels
have been based on expected future population patterns and extensions of the
sanitary perimeter. The constant per capita assumption is the net result of
expected lower-than-average per capita consumption for just under half the new
population served, which will be urban poor 1/, coupled with expected modest
increases in per capita consumption of the more affluent consumers. Further-
more, it is not expected that the composition of demand will change signifi-
cantly during the coming decade (para. 3.18). The expected population served,
total consumption and total production for the years 1979 through 1990 are
given in Annex 2 and summarized in the following table:
1/   Middle-income families consume 257 lcpd per capita while low-income
families consume 155 lcpd.

stated due to a meter readers' strike. Growth rates have been based
on estimated consumption of 231.3 million m3 (3.23 million inhabitants
served x 196 lcpd).
Source: EAAB
3.23      The projected water demand and available supply are presented
graphically in Figure 3.3. It is evident that even if consumption grows at
a faster rate than expected, EAAB will have sufficient supply capability to
meet requirements up to 1990. After the completion of the Chingaza Project
in early 1981, EAAB will have a supply capability of 25.6 m3/sec which compares
with projected production requirements of 20.3 m /sec in 1990.  Thus, there
will be no supply constraints on demand growth. Also, it appears that tariffs
would not need to be increased significantly in real terms and accordingly
should not have much impact on future demand.
Sewerage
3.24      Demand for sewerage service has been based on expected population
growth patterns and planned extension of the sanitary perimeter. The projected
population to be served is given in Annex 3 and summarized for selected years
in the table below:

Urban Poor
3.25      In the affluent and middle-income areas of the city over 95% of the
residents are served with water and sewerage connections and all new consumers
in these areas are expected to be served. Thus, the improvement in the
projected overall EAAB service levels for both water and sewerage represents
principally increased service levels to the urban poor (para. 7.12). Both the
City Government and EAAB have a good record of providing water and sewerage
services to the poor, and these policies, including low connection fees and
cross-subsidized tariffs for low-volume consumers are expected to continue in
the future.
IV. THE IMPLEMENTING AGENCY
A.   Organization
4.01      The Borrower and implementing agency will be EAAB which is an
autonomous public enterprise owned by the Municipality of the Special District
of Bogota. It was organized in 1955 under a decree of the Municipal Council
and has responsibility for planning, constructing and operating all water
supply, sewerage and drainage facilities in the Special District. Its charter
provides all authorities needed by EAAB to operate effectively, and for
exemption from income taxes and duties.
4.02      EAAB is governed by a seven-member Board of Directors with three
members representing the Municipality of Bogota, including the Mayor who is
the Chairman of the Board, and the others representing financing institutions,
including the Banco de la Republica. The General Manager, who is the Chief
Executive Officer, is appointed by the Mayor and EAAB's other seven principal
officers are appointed by the Board. While EAAB is autonomous, its invest-
ment program must be integrated with other development programs for the
Municipality, and proposed major works must be approved by the Municipal
Planning Board and the Municipal Government.



- 20 -
4.03      The organizational structure of EAAB is presented in Annex 4.
There are five major departments reporting to the General Manager which are
responsible for planning, administration, engineering, finance and operations.
Also reporting to the General Manager is the Office of the Corporate Secretary
which is responsible for legal affairs and external relations. The organiza-
tion is functional and effective and coordination among the departments is
good.
B.   Management and Staff
Management
4.04      While it is the Board of Directors' responsibility to appoint EAAB's
General Manager, in practice the nominee is selected by the Mayor of Bogota.
This practice has resulted in frequent changes in General Managers, but
performance on the whole has been good. The present General Manager assumed
office in September 1978 and is fully qualified for the position. To some
extent the selection of departmental managers has been influenced by political
considerations and internal promotions to these positions have been the
exception rather than the rule. The present holders of these positions are,
however, qualified and their respective departments are functioning efficiently.
Professional Staff
4.05      The quality of professional staff is generally good, although
some recruitment difficulties are experienced because remuneration is not
competitive with the private sector. This situation is normal for most public
utilities in Colombia, but has not been critical in the case of EAAB. Local
consultants are well qualified and are used to supplement EAAB staff, prin-
cipally for feasibility studies and the design of civil works.
Employees
4.06      At the end of 1978 EAAB had a total of 2,691 employees, of which
196 were categorized as professional, 982 as clerical and 1,513 as workers.
The number of employees has increased by 63% since 1971 compared with an
increase of 75% in water connections and major increase.s in treatment capacity
and sewerage and drainage facilities. In 1978 EAAB had 6 employees for every
1000 connections, which is very satisfactory for a water utility in Latin
America. Management recognizes that there is some overstaffing in certain
job categories and understaffing in others and measures are underway to
correct the imbalance. Management's relations with staff are generally good,
and Management has the flexibility to hire, discharge and transfer employees
as required.
Evaluation
4.07      Since the first Bank loan in 1968, EAAB has successfully coped with
difficult technical and financial issues and has developed into a mature and
efficiently managed water authority. The present Management has both the
intention and capability of continuing to improve the functioning of the
institution.



- 21 -
Covenants
4.08      In negotiations, EAAB agreed to retain provisions under the previous
loans which require EAAB to give the Bank the opportunity to comment on any
proposed substantial reorganization of EAAB and specify that any amendment
to the EAAB charter which would adversely affect project implementation,
EAAB's operations or its financial situation, without the Bank's prior agree-
ment, would constitute a default under the loan.
C.   Training
4.09      EAAB's turnover of staff is low and the majority of its employees
have a number of years of service on the job. The training requirement is
therefore not large, and at present, internal training programs are designed
to retrain employees for new assignments in areas where they are needed.
Apart from this, most of EAAB's training is on the job after assignment.
Manpower planning in EAAB is satisfactory and existing training programs
are appropriate to EAAB's requirements.
D.   Management Systems
Planning
4.10      Long-range development planning by the Planning Department is under-
taken in a highly satisfactory manner. EAAB regularly prepares and updates
four-year investment programs of which the proposed project is one. The
Planning Department remains involved in new projects during the design and
construction phases, which are the principal responsibilities of the Engineering
Department.
Capital Budgets
4.11      EAAB prepares long-range capital budgets in conformity with the
investment program. Annual capital budgets are prepared in detail and dis-
bursements against these budgets by category are monitored during the year.
Long-range revenue and expense projections are also prepared, and detailed
operating budgets are prepared for each year against which actual results are
compared. The system is currently being improved to provide for more frequent
and earlier comparisons of actual results versus budget.
E.   Accounting, Information Systems and Commercial Operations
Accounting System
4.12      The accounting system is appropriate for a water and sewerage
authority and is being utilized properly. Accounting reports are available
within reasonable periods. Management is now considering the rental of a
computer with greater capacity which would assume more functions and accel-
erate the issuance of reports. The Bank will assist EAAB in the selection
of this computer.



- 22 -
Information Systems
4.13      There is a wealth of information available within EAAB, but it has
been spread over a number of reports issued by different departments and fails
to reach the Management in a combined and relevant format. In January 1979,
the Planning Department assumed responsibility for the gathering of statistics
and commenced the issuance of a report containing key operating and financial
data for monthly submission to Management and to the Board of Directors.
Commercial Operations
4.14      Meter reading, billing and collection procedures are satisfactory
and working well. To reduce manpower requirements, EAAB has recently shifted
to bi-monthly billing. Accounts receivable from water sales currently amount
to about two months' sales, which is satisfactory.
F.   Audit and Insurance
Audit
4.15      The office of EAAB's Internal Auditor is functioning satisfactorily
with respect to verification of normal transactions and ascertaining if
required procedures are being followed with respect to contracting and dis-
bursements. EAAB's external auditor is Jose Ulises Martinez S. Cia. Ltda.
which has performed audits of EAAB's accounts and has issued acceptable
reports.
Insurance
4.16      EAAB carries fire and casualty insurance on buildings and equipment
subject to these risks. While these assets represent only a small portion of
EAAB's total assets, it is not considered necessary or practical to ensure
treatment plants, transmission mains, distribution mains, sewerage collectors
and drainage canals. Accordingly, the insurance coverage of EAAB is adequate.
G.   Performance Under Previous Loans
4.17      The Bank's relationship with EAAB began in 1966 and encompasses
two projects (Loans 536-CO in 1968, and 741-CO in 1971) for water treatment
and transmission. For both projects, demand projections were over-optimistic
as initial population, population growth rates, service level projections
and per capita consumption trends were over-estimated. Construction of the
first project, the Tibito Treatment Plant, was delayed by two years as a result
of design revisions, faulty workmanship and withdrawal of two contractors.
The delays, coupled with inflation which was more rapid than had been antici-
pated, produced a 45% cost overrun which resulted in EAAB's retrenching on
its water distribution and sewerage network expansion programs 1/.
1/   See Project Performance Audit Report (Loan 536-CO) and Project Completion
Report dated March 30, 1978 (M78-260).



- 23 -
4.18      The second project, the Chingaza reservoir, tunnel, treatment plant
and pipeline, was originally scheduled for completion in 1977, but is now
expected to be completed in early 1981. This substantial delay resulted
primarily from award of the tunneling contract, which was the single largest
contract and the most time-critical, to a firm which subsequently did not
perform satisfactorily.  The slow progress duping that contractor's time on
the job, and the time taken to retender and for a new contractor to commence
work, accounted for the delay. As in the case of the previous project, a
substantial cost overrun (estimated to be 60%) is expected (Annex 5).
4.19      Project execution delays experienced in the previous projects
were largely not controllable by EAAB. The proposed project works are not
technically difficult and are similar to works already completed by EAAB
and local contractors. It is therefore expected that the project works will
not be subject to the same factors causing delays in the previous projects and
that they can be completed on schedule.
H.   CAR
4.20      CAR is a decentralized organization at the national level, reporting
to DNP. CAR was created by Law 3a of 1961, and its principal purpose is to
promote and direct the economic development of the Bogota Plain and administer
its natural resources to assure their best possible use for urban, agriculture,
mining, and industrial development. One of CAR's principal functions is to
reduce pollution in the Plain's waterways.
4.21      CAR has not demonstrated much dynamism in carrying out its pollution
control functions or in proceeding with feasibility studies which are a pre-
requisite to future pollution control and flood reduction programs. CAR will
be the implementing agency for the Bogota River rectification feasibility study
which is included in the proposed project. However, the study will be super-
vised by a permanent committee composed of representatives from CAR, EAAB and
EEEB, and since its funding apart from the Bank loan should not be difficult,
it is considered that the proposed arrangements are satisfactory (para. 5.16).
V. THE PROJECT
A.   Background
5.01      The project would be the third operation with EAAB.  The First
Bogota Water Supply Project was financed by Bank Loan 536-CO in 1968 and
represented the first stage of Bogota's Water Supply Master Plan developed
in 1967 at the request of the Bank. It was implemented between 1970 and
1975 and included an increase in capacity of the Tibito Treatment Plant from
4 to 12 m3/sec, a 78" diameter 62 km transmission main, two storage tanks,
50 km of distribution mains and networks, water metering and leak detection,
institutional improvements and preliminary engineering for the Chingaza Water
Diversion Scheme, including construction of access roads. The Second Bogota
Water Supply Project was financed by Bank Loan 741-CO in 1971 and represented



- 24 -
the second phase of the Master Plan.  It included engineering design and
construction of the first stage of the Chingaza Project and related distri-
bution works and provision of equipment and studies for future water, sewer
and drainage projects. The first two projects will meet Bogota's water
supply requirements up to 1990 and subsequent water supply investments
will be for reinforcement and extension of distribution networks 1/.
5.02      The project constitutes ongoing extensions of distribution net-
works consistent with the water supply Master Plan and extension of sewerage
and drainage systems under a Master Plan which was prepared in 1964. The
Master Sewerage and Drainage Plan proposes the canalization of existing
natural water courses and the protection of these courses from contamination
by collecting all sewage discharges now made into them inside the sanitary
perimeter by means of parallel sanitary interceptors. The treatment and
proper ultimate disposition of wastewater was not included in the Master Plan
and will be studied under the project. The project represents EAAB's 1979-1982
approved investment program.
5.03      The project was formulated by EAAB's technical staff, with the
assistance of Colombian consultants, and is consistent with the needs of
Bogota's population for additional water supply and environmental improvement.
Extension and reinforcement of the water distribution system are in response
to the need to facilitating the flow of water to certain areas where the
demand has increased in recent years. The need for preventing flooding and
diverting sanitary wastes from the open storm water canals has been stated
often by the local press and is well recognized by the population in general.
EAAB has not conducted a formal public participation program in formulating
the project, but plans a public information program to explain the project
prior to construction.
5.04      The proposed project is consistent with the Government's policy of
improving water supply and sewerage levels in the capital city, which are
currently below those of other large cities. Of particular concern in the
Bogota area are the increasing levels of pollution in the city waterways and in
the Bogota and Magdalena Rivers. The proposed project will include feasibility
studies to determine the best means of reducing this pollution. The objec-
tives of the project are consistent with Bogota's requirements and development
plans and the Government's urban development objectives for Bogota.
B. Objectives
5.05      The overall objective of the project is to improve the health and
living conditions of Bogota's residents, in particular the urban poor,
through provision of water supply, sewerage and drainage facilities. Spe-
cific project objectives are as follows:
(a) to provide potable water to. 1.1 million additional individuals
(131,000 new connections) including 24 low-income barrios to
be newly served;
1/   See paras. 4.17 and 4.18 for a description of EAAB's performance in
executing these projects.



- 25 -
(b) to improve water distribution in the city taking into account
the system's new feeding point at Usaquen after 1980 and the
newly served areas under the second Bank-financed project
and the proposed project;
(c) to provide sewerage connections to 1.0 million additional
persons (123,000 new connections) including 55 low-income
barrios to be newly served;
(d) to reduce pollution in city waterways by extending sewerage
interceptors to the sanitary perimeter (with the exception
of the Salitre Channel, para. 5.09);
(e) to provide storm water drainage in 1,900 ha. of low areas
where 0.4 million persons live (18 barrios) and which are
now periodically flooded;
(f) to determine the least-cost means of reducing pollution in
the Bogota River;
(g) to determine the least-cost means of improving the capacity
of the Bogota River to remove wastes and flood waters in the
city; and
(h) to continue with the institutional and financial improvement
of EAAB commenced under the two previous loans.
5.06      In 1983, after completion of the project, the service levels for
water supply will be 90.4% compared with 86.2% expected in 1979 and sewerage
service levels will be 85.0% compared with 81.0% expected in 1979. The
specific objectives with respect to urban poor are set forth in para. 7.13.
C.   Project Description
5.07      The project consists of a number of independent subprojects which
constitute EAAB's water supply, sewerage and storm water drainage investment
program for the period 1979-1982. The specific project components are des-
cribed in Annex 6 and summarized below:
(a) Water Supply:
(i) about 27.0 km of primary distribution mains to supply
new areas of urban development and to take into account
the distribution system's new supply point at Usaquen; and
(ii) about 80 km of distribution networks to serve 24 low-income
barrios near the city perimeter.
(b) Sewerage:
(i) about 17.0 km of interceptors to collect sewage that is
currently discharged into four surface canals; and
(ii) sewerage networks of about 150 km in 48 low-income barrios,
plus combined networks in another seven barrios.



- 26 -
(c) Storm Water Drainage:
(i) about 10 km of drainage canals on three waterways;
(ii) three regulating reservoirs in the basin of the
Tunjuelo River to hold storm water; and
(iii) storm water drainage networks in 18 low-income barrios.
(d) Equipment:
(i) procurement and installation of 215,000 water meters,
equipment for leak detection, construction and
maintenance equipment and vehicles.
(e) construction of a pilot sewage treatment plant (45 1/sec);
(f)  Project Engineering:
(i) engineering services including consultant services,
for detailed design and construction supervision;
(g) Feasibility Studies:
(i) feasibility studies for the disposal of Bogota's sewage
and design for the first stage treatment plant, including
consultant services; and
(ii) feasibility studies and master plan for the rectification
of the Bogota River and design for the first phase of the
master plan, including consultant services.
D.   Technical Justification
Project Works
5.08      The water supply component of the project consists of distribution
networks to be constructed in conformity with existing designs which are
considered appropriate and have proven to be successful. A similar situation
exists for sewerage networks. For water supply, individual connections have
been established as normal service for all consumers, and water standpipes are
only used as interim measures.
5.09      The sewerage interceptors and drainage canals are extensions of
facilities already built in their initial stretches. The designs have proven
successful and will be followed for this project. The sewerage and drainage
facilities included in the project are those whose technical feasibility does
not depend on the rectification of the Bogota River which will not be completed
until the late 1980s. The Salitre Canal has not been included in the project
since flooding inside the perimeter would not be eliminated by the canal
under existing Bogota River flow conditions.
5.10      The component of the project which will provide regulation to the
Tunjuelo River to diminish periodic flooding was selected among a number of



- 27 -
alternatives considered which would have produced the desired benefits. The
three basic alternatives were to construct a dam at the upstream end of the
middle stretch of the river and reserve an area for flooding in the middle
stretch, construction of the dam with full canalization of the river downstream,
and construction of earth embankments along the middle stretch to form three
impounding reservoirs. The last scheme was selected as it was determined to
be the least-cost alternative.                 /
5.11      Water meters are needed to meet new connection requirements and
replace worn out existing meters. Leak detection equipment will help reduce
unaccounted-for water. Construction and maintenance equipment and vehicles
will improve the overall operations and maintenance of the water supply and
sewerage systems.
Status of Preparation
5.12      Project preparation is at an advanced stage.  Final designs have
been completed for the primary water mains, sewerage collectors and drainage
systems. Preliminary designs have been completed for the water supply dis-
tribution and for the sewerage networks. Final designs for all components
are scheduled for completion early this year and bidding documents will be
ready for all contracts by mid-1979. There is no need to implement short
term remedial measures prior to completion of the main project components.
Feasibility Studies - Pilot Sewage Treatment Plant
5.13      Two feasibility studies are included in the project, one for pollu-
tion abatement in Bogota and in the Bogota River and the other for flood
control adjacent to the Bogota River and its tributaries inside the city. The
Bogota River pollution problem was studied to the pre-feasibility level by
consultants 1/ 1974 as part of the second Bank project (Chingaza). The
consultants recommended as the least-cost scheme for treatment of all of
Bogota's sewage, construction of a major interceptor along the east bank of
the Bogota River which would convey sewage (with pumping) to one large treat-
ment plant south of the city on the Plain or 80 km downstream near Tocaima 2/.
EAAB has not accepted this solution as the optimum and considers that the
technical and economic feasibility requires further study. The principal
alternative to be studied would be the staged construction of three treatment
plants at the terminus of each of the main sewage collectors. This latter
alternative would avoid a one-time major investment in sewage treatment facili-
ties and possibly result in a reduction in total investment as treatment of part
of the sewage may be sufficient to allow the natural purification process of the
Bogota River to reclaim itself. Both CAR and Bank staff agree with EAAB that
further technical and economic studies are required.

2/   The downstream location would lower treatment costs as its warmer climate
and its altitude of 360 m above sea level, vs. 2,600 m on the Plain,
would reduce the requirement for injection of oxygen.



- 28 -
5.14      The proposed study would consist of four parts to be completed by
the end of 1982 including a receiving water study, an industrial waste survey,
laboratory scale treatment studies, and identification and evaluation of
alternative solutions. Subsequently, design of the first stage of the
recommended collection and treatment system would be prepared.
5.15      For proper completion of the design for sewage treatment, a pilot
sewage treatment plant is required and included in the project. Operating
data collected from the pilot plant should allow the design of the full
size plant to be optimized. The plant is now assumed to have a capacity
of 45 1/sec, but the final design and capacity will be determined by the
consultants recruited for the treatment plant feasibility study.
5.16      The rectification of the Bogota River to eliminate flooding, has also
been studied by consultants 1/ to the pre-feasibility level, which confirmed
that river deepening, straightening and canalizing was the best solution.
The proposed feasibility study will be undertaken and financed jointly by
CAR, EAAB and EEEB, with the assistance of consultants, who will examine all
legal and institutional implications of the Bogota River course correction,
prepare a master plan for the rectification of the river, determine the
least-cost alternative and staging of the works proposed, and prepare designs
for the first phase of the master plan. CAR, which is responsible for water
management on the Bogota Plain, will be the executing agency. Close coordi-
nation will be maintained by EAAB with CAR during implementation of the two
studies since the changed hydraulics of the river will affect the discharge
conditions of sewers and drainage channels and is therefore directly related
to EAAB's sewerage and flood control projects.
E.   Cost Estimates
5.17      The estimated total cost of the project is Col$3,340 million
(US$62.65 million) as shown in Table 5.1. The total foreign exchange cost
of the project is US$30.0 million (48%) and the local cost is Col$1,745
million (US$32.65 million). Interest during construction on the Bank loan,
which is not included in the cost estimate, is estimated to be US$4.0 million.
Detailed cost estimates and basic assumptions, and estimates of annual expendi-
ture are provided respectively in Annexes 7 and 8.
5.18      The cost estimates have been prepared by EAAB and their consultants
and are based on recent bids made for similar civil works and acquisition
of materials and equipment updated to December 1978. The allowance for physical
contingencies is 10%, which is realistic since the works are well defined
and the conditions in the area are well known. The allowances for price and
currency variations are 49% in the Colombian peso cost estimate and 14% in
the U.S. dollar estimate, which are considered adequate. The foreign exchange
component includes the cost of materials and equipment that will be imported
and foreign consultants' fees (US$11.04 million) and the indirect foreign costs
of civil construction and local material (US$18.96 million). Indirect foreign

costs, estimated to be 37% of the cost of civil works, are principally depre-
ciation on heavy construction equipment that will be needed to install the
large pipes and to construct major drainage channels. It is considered that
the basic assumptions are realistic and that the project can be completed
within the estimated cost.
F.   Prolect Financing
5.19      Total financing required for the project, including interest during
construction and working capital, is estimated to be Col$4,173 million
(US$78.3 million). Of this total, the proposed loan would finance the
direct and indirect foreign exchange component of Col$1,595 million (US$30.0
million). The proposed loan would have a maturity of 17 years, including
a four-year grace period. Internal cash generation of EAAB and betterment
levies would provide the remainder of the required financing as indicated
in the following table:

5.20      The financial projections for EAAB indicate that internal cash
generation during the period 1979-1982 will be adequate to meet all project
financing requirements not covered by the Bank loan and that the financing
plan for the project is feasible (para. 6.21).



- 31 -
5.21      CAR has approached bilateral donors requesting grant financing for
the sewage disposal feasibility studies and the pilot treatment plant. If
grant financing is made available for one or both of these components before
proposals and bids respectively are called, these components would remain part
of the project ut the funds allocated for them would be cancelled from the
Bank loan. The amounts to be cancelled in such event are US$730,000 for the
sewage studies and US$960,000 for the pilot treatment plant.
G.   Implementation
The Executing Agency
5.22      EAAB will implement the project with the exception of the Bogota
River rectification studies for which it shares responsibility with CAR, the
coordinator, and EEEB. This will be the third Bank-financed project for EAAB,
which is considered to be fully competent to construct the project facilities
on schedule and undertake the feasibility studies (Chapter IV).
5.23      One-half of the final designs have been prepared by EAAB and the
other half by local consultants under EAAB's supervision. All consultants
have done previous work for EAAB and are fully qualified for the design of
this project. The project works are straightforward and capable of being
constructed by local contractors who have previously completed similar works
and who follow well-developed construction standards similar to those applied
internationally. Construction supervision for all subprojects will be by EAAB
personnel, who are considered qualified. Consultants must still be selected
for the feasibility studies, and because of the specialized nature of some of
the work, it is expected that the participation of foreign consultants will be
required.
Schedule
5.24      The project components will be constructed over the period 1979-1982
in accordance with the implementation schedule given in Annex 9. Bidding is
expected to commence for most components in mid-1979 and contracts to be
awarded before year end. Scheduled completion of all works at the end of
1982 is considered to be within the capability of EAAB and local contractors.
5.25      EAAB will not require any special legislative or administrative
approvals for the implementation of the various project components as it
already has the necessary authorities within its charter. Land required for
the project will be acquired at an estimated cost of Col$98.0 million (US$2.4
million) and purchase contracts for the bulk of the land have already been
negotiated. In the event a purchase cannot be arranged, EAAB has the legal
authority to force a land sale. Accordingly, there are no legal or adminis-
trative factors which would prevent execution of the project on schedule.
Operation and Maintenance
5.26      On completion of the project works, they will be operated by EAAB.
Because the works consist of water and sewerage networks and heavy civil works
(sewerage interceptors, holding reservoirs and drainage canals), operating



- 32 -
requirements in terms of manpower and recurring expense will be low. EAAB
has demonstrated the capability to operate and maintain similar works and
continued satisfactory performance may be expected.
Reservoirs
5.27      The project involves construction of three holding reservoirs along
the Tunjuelo River. These will be created by construction of low earth-
filled dikes which are of conventional design for the Bogota area including
factors for seismic forces, and will not require a design review board.
H.   Water Resources and Environmental Aspects
5.28      Ample water resources are available to meet the water supply require-
ments of the project distribution networks and new connections. The studies
for sewage disposal and rectification of the Bogota River are directly related
to future water quality in the River adjacent to and downstream from Bogota.
CAR has established quality standards for this stretch of the River, but because
there is no treatment of either industrial waste or sewage, these standards
are not being met. The Bogota River study will review the existing standards
and recommend ones which are economically justified and environmentally sound.
5.29      There are no negative environmental effects associated with the
project. The project works will reduce pollution in the city waterways in
populated areas and reduce periodic flooding along these waterways. The
feasibility studies will determine solutions for the disposal of Bogota's
sewage in a manner to reduce pollution levels in the Bogota River and to in-
crease its carrying capacity so as to eliminate flooding.
I.   Procurement
Civil Works and Equipment
5.30      Procurement contracts will be awarded through international compe-
titive bidding in accordance with Bank guidelines, with the exception of civil
works contracts under the equivalent of US$300,000 and materials and equipment
contracts under the equivalent of US$100,000. These smaller contracts will be
awarded under local bidding procedures which are acceptable to the Bank up
to an aggregate amount of US$2.0 million. It is expected that the contracts
to be awarded under international competitive bidding will range from US$0.9
million to US$4.5 million for civil works and US$0.1 million to US$2.8 million
for materials and equipment (Annex 10). For the purpose of evaluating bids,
the lower of either a margin of preference of 15% or the corresponding custom
duties will be allowed for equipment or material manufactured in Colombia with
a Colombian content of 20% or more. Civil works contracts are expected to be
won by local contractors and most equipment supply contracts by foreign
suppliers.



- 33 -
Consultants' Services
5.31      Consulting services for project design and supervision and for
feasibility studies will be awarded to qualified consultants under terms of
reference and terms of contract satisfactory to the Bank.  In t.he event the
sewage disposal feasibility study is financed from bilateral sources (para.
5.21), the selection of consultants will also be made under the above condi-
tions. It is expected that the prime consulting contracts will be awarded to
local firms which will subcontract specialized portions to foreign firms.
It is estimated that for project design and supervision and for the feasibility
studies a total of 1,372 man months of consultancy services will be utilized
with an average cost of US$3,450 per man month.
Contract Schedule
5.32      A schedule of proposed contract awards is included as Annex 10.
All construction contracts are expected to be awarded by January 1980 and
all equipment purchase contracts by November 1981.
Advance Contracting
5.33      The project component for water and sewerage network extensions
and water meters represent ongoing construction programs. In order not
to delay the benefits of these programs, EAAB will proceed with the awarding
of network construction contracts and the first bidding for meters prior to
loan approval. This advance contracting will represent not more than 10% of
the total civil works costs, and retroactive financing of expenditures made
after January 1, 1979 up to the date of loan signing will not exceed US$900,000.
J.   Disbursements
5.34      The proposed allocation of the loan proceeds and the disburse-
ment percentages are as follows:

5.35      A schedule of disbursements by quarter is presented in Annex 11.
Disbursements for the project should be completed by June 30, 1983, which
will be the closing date for the loan. EAAB is fully familiar with Bank
international bidding requirements and disbursement procedures.
VI. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A.   Past Financial Performance and Present Position
1971-1975 Results
6.01      During the period 1971-1975 EAAB's tariffs were increased at a
rate below that of inflation and operating costs increased by 165% compared
with a 111% increase in revenues. The operating ratio increased from .61 in
1971 to .76 in 1975 and the rate of return on revalued net fixed assets in
operation declined from 11.8% to 4.0%, versus the covenanted 10.0% rate of
return under Loan 741-CO.  Because of inadequate internal cash generation
the debt service ratio fell (from 7.2 in 1971 to 1.7 in 1975) and capital
expenditures for network extensions were deferred (Annex 13 - Historical
Financial Statements).
1976-1977 Results
6.02      EAAB's financial situation in late 1975 was a matter of great con-
cern for the Bank and EAAB's new management. In June 1976, after a careful



- 35 -
analysis of revenue requirements, EAAB undertook a 24-month program of tariff
restructuring and increases which improved average revenues per m3 sold by
45% in 1976, 53% in 1977 and 12% in 1978. A summarized statement of income
and expenses for the years 1975 through 1978 is presented in the following
table:

Operating Ratio                     .76       .66       .64        .75
Rate of Return                      4.0%      6.8%      9.1%       5.9%
6.03      Operating ratios, net income and rate of return improved notably in
1976 and 1977 as a result of substantial tariff increases.  As a result
of increased internal cash generation, the debt service ratio improved from
1.7 in 1975 to 4.2 in 1977 and the contribution to capital expenditures from
13% to 37%.  The rate of return in 1977 reached 9.1%, which was slightly
below the covenanted return of 10.0% under Loan 741-CO.
1978 Results
6.04      The rate of improvement in EAAB's financial situation slowed down
in 1978 as a result of three principal factors. First, the 24 month tariff
increase program provided for much higher monthly tariff increases at its
inception and in early 1978 they had slowed to under 1.0% per month. In May,
when the program ended, the Board adopted a program of regular 1% per month
increases in water and sewerage charges (12.7% annual rate). The second
factor was the meter readers' strike (para. 3.19) which deprived EAAB of an
estimated Col$ 147 million of revenues which will not be recovered. The final
factor was that operating expenses increased by 36%, reflecting in large part
wage adjustments based on the prior year's rate of inflation.



- 36 -
6.05      The actual financial results for EAAB in 1978 represent a reversal
of the improving trend, but are still acceptable, particularly from the
standpoint of internal cash generation. In 1978, higher tariffs and a result-
ing higher rate of return would have generated excess cash flow. Table 6.2
presents key financial data for 1978 as reported on an adjusted basis to
include the estimated revenues lost from the meter readers' strike.

6.06       EAAB's assets and depreciation are revalued annually using a national
consumer price index 1/, a procedure which will be continued under the proposed
loan. Long-term debt, which consists of foreign loans denominated at current
exchange rates, amounted to less than 30% of total capitalization at the end
of 1978. EAAB's current financial position is wholly satisfactory.
B.   Revenues
Tariffs
6.07      Revenues from sales of water and from the provision of sewerage
services provide about 75% of EAAB's total operating revenues. EAAB's over-
all required level of tariffs is derived from projections of operating and
financial expenses and cash requirements for debt service and capital expendi-
tures not to be financed by borrowings. Tariff revisions must be approved by
the EAAB Board of Directors which as a practical matter requires agreement of
the Bogota Municipal Council. The proposed tariffs must then be approved by
the National Tariff Board, which in practice has a record of approving justified
requests for tariff revisions.
6.08      During the period 1971-1975 inclusive, EAAB's average revenues per
m3 of water sold increased by only 46% compared with a 115% increase in prices,
primarily as a result of the reluctance of the Bogota Municipal Council to
approve tariff increases. Shortly after the formation of a new Municipal Council
and the appointment of a business-minded General Manager, EAAB in June 1976 em-
barked on a program of increases which improved average revenue per m3 sold
from Col$ 2.51 (US$0.082) in 1975 to Col$ 6.24 (US$0.159) in 1978, a gain of
149% versus a general price level increase of 80% during the same period.
1/   Indice Nacional de los Precios al Consumidor (Costo de Vida) - Obreros.



- 3 7 -
6.09      The present tariff structure is based on an in-house study completed
in early 1976 which provided for the gradual change in the then existing
structure over a 24-month period, June 1976-May 1978. The structure now pro-
vides for six consumer categories, of which residential, commercial, indus-
trial and mixed (commercial/residential or industrial/residentij'l) account for
99.5% of the consumers and 87% of consumption. Residential consumers are
divided into seven groups based on the assessed value of their properties,
and a very modest fixed monthly charge is levied for provision of services 1/.
Consumption is billed in four blocks, with tariffs being progressive with
respect to both assessed property values and consumption. In the first block
(up to 25 m3) consumers in the lowest two categories pay Col$ 2.14/m3
(US$0.054), while consumers in the top category pay Col$5.36/m3 (US$0.134).
Consumption for all residential categories above 60 m3 is billed at
Col$8.58/m3 (US$0.215) Small industrial and commercial consumers are placed
in the appropriate residential category based on assessed property values,
and billed at rates which are 15-30% higher.  Large industrial consumers are
billed at a flat rate of Col$ 7.07/m3 (US$0.177). Charges for sewerage are
30% of the water bill for all categories of consumers (Annex 12).
6.10      The tariff structure is simple, well designed and appropriate to
Bogota's economic situation. It produces proper levels of revenue in
relation to costs 2/ while providing substantial cross-subsidies to low-income
consumers. The two lowest residential consumer categories, accounting for
41% of EAAB's total consumers, use about 28% of the water sold but contribute
only 17% of revenues. The cross-subsidies from higher income residential
consumers amount to about 50% for the lowest residential consumer category
and about 40% for the second lowest category 3/. Overall, residential con-
sumers through category four, accounting for 91% of residential consumers,
are receiving cross-subsidies. The charge for sewerage service is below the
estimated cost of providing service 2/. Since the sewerage charge is levied
as a percentage of the water charge and total revenues are sufficient to cover
all of EAAB's operating costs, and since most water consumers have sewerage
connections, readjustment of the sewage charge vis a vis the water charge
would mainly have conceptual significance.
Connection Fees
6.11      House and network connection fees account for about 19% of EAAB's
operating revenues. House connection fees for new consumers include a flat
charge equivalent to 3% of the appraised value of the land and improvements.
1/   Col$ 7.00 (US$0.175) for the lowest group, Col$ 12.00 (US$0.30) for the
second lowest group and Col$15.00 (US$0.375) for the remaining five
groups.
2/   For relationship of tariffs to long run marginal costs (AIC), para. 7.11.
3/   Subsidies measured by the difference between the average revenues/i3
and the revenues/m' from the specific category.



- 38 -
In the case of new low-income consumers, the fees are customarily made in
installments and/or reduced to affordable levels. Where distribution net-
works are installed by developers, the developer is required to pay Col$16.90
(US$0.423) for each square meter of saleable land as a contribution to the
cost of transmission mains.
C.   Capital Contributions
6.12      EAAB has two additional sources of funds which are treated as
capital contributions rather than operating revenue. These include better-
ment levies, known as valorization, and consumer contributions to installation
costs and to distribution networks.
Valorization
6.13      Valorization is a levy on residents of an area whose property values
will be enhanced by public works projects such as roads, sewerage or drainage.
The valorization charge in total is designed to recover the capital costs of
a project, and the individual property owners pay their pro-rata share based
on land area. Where the charges are low in relation to incomes they are col-
lected in one payment, but normally the beneficiaries are able to make payment
over a six-year period with interest. Valorization for all public works in
the City of Bogota are billed and collected by a city authority, the Institute
of Urban Development (IDU). IDU's collection of valorization charges on
EAAB's sewerage and drainage works has been well below scheduled collections.
While these collections do not represent a significant source of funds to
EAAB, a workable means of receiving these funds on schedule is considered
desirable and EAAB agreed in negotiations to make arrangements with IDU
acceptable to the Bank.
Consumer Contributions
6.14      Consumer contributions to EAAB's water and sewerage networks are
made in three ways. First, new consumers must reimburse the actual costs of
making a connection. For low-income consumers deferred payments are accepted.
Second, before EAAB installs networks in new areas the residents must contri-
bute 30% of the cost of the networks, and subsequent to installation repay the
remaining 70% of the cost over a period of ten years. Third,.when a developer
installs the networks, the cost is recovered in the selling price of the lots
and houses, and the networks are donated to EAAB. These methods of recovering
network capital costs are effective, and have not precluded the provision of
services to poor areas.
D.   Financial Projections
Income Statement
6.15      Financial projections for EAAB for the years 1979-1985 have been
based on the assumption of continuing with the 1% monthly increase in water
and sewerage tariffs in 1979, an increase to 1 1/2% monthly commencing in
1980 and revision in consumer classifications in 1979 which will produce an
additional 9% in revenues. Operating expenses have been projected to increase



- 39 -
in line with water sales plus inflation of 22% for 1979, 20% for 1980 and 1981
and 16% p.a. thereafter. Financial projections for the years 1979-1985 and
the basic underlying assumptions are contained in Annex 13.
6.16      Projected income statements for the years 1979-1983, which cover
the period or project construction, are presented in the following table:

6.17      EAAB's projected income performance is satisfactory, but will not
produce a rate of return of 10% in 1979 and 1980 as covenanted under Loan
741-CO. At the time that Loan was approved, it was expected that this high
rate of return would be needed as long as the Chingaza Project were under
construction, and that after completion a lower return would be established
in light of EAAB's then existing financial requirements. In view of the fact
that the projected rates of return of 7.1% and 7.2% in 1979 and 1980, res-
pectively, will produce sufficient internal cash generation, after meeting
debt service requirements, to cover 51% of capital expenditures in those
years, raising tariffs further than now proposed simply to achieve a higher
rate of return is not warranted. A similar situation is projected in subse-
quent years when the contribution to capital expenditures is forecast to
increase to a higher percentage. In negotiations EAAB agreed to maintain a
7.0% rate of return in 1979 and 1980, 5.0% in 1981 and 1982, and 6.0% in
subsequent years. The lower rate for 1981 and 1982 reflects the inclusion
of the substantial investment in Chingaza in the fixed asset base. The
projections indicate that the proposed rates of return will produce satis-
factory levels of internal cash generation during the 1979-1985 period.

Internal Cash Generation
6.18      EAAB's capital expenditures in 1979 and 1980 are expected to amount
to almost Col$ 5.4 billion (US$116.0 million). While internal cash genera-
tion is expected to increase substantially and funds will be available from
two Bank loans, there are still expected to be uncovered cash requirements
in those years. The major reason for this shortfall is the continued expend-
itures on the Chingaza Project which has been delayed and is expected to
experience a 60% cost overrun. To cover the expected Col$909 million (US$20.0
million) cash shortfall in 1979 and 1980, EAAB will secure a foreign exchange
loan for which proposals have been received and informal approval granted by
the Government.
6.19      After 1980, internally generated cash and the proposed Bank loan
are projected to meet cash requirements for debt service and capital expendi-
tures not covered by the Bank Loan. EAAB's capitalization is forecast to
remain conservative with the debt-to-total capitalization ratio remaining
below 30% during the forecast period.

6.21      The financing plan indicates that internal cash generation will
meet 64% of total cash requirements. Of the total capital expenditures of
Col$10.6 billion, about Col$1.6 billion in 1981 and 1982 represents works
in the stage of preliminary design which may be deferred if necessary.
Accordingly, there is sufficient flexibility in the financing plan and it
is considered to be feasible.
F.   Monitoring and Evaluation Criteria
6.22      Continuing of the procedure established under previous loans,
EAAB will submit quarterly reports on the progress of the project and on the
operating and financial performance of the authority. Specific criteria for
the monitoring of project implementation and the financial performance of EAAB
were agreed upon in negotiations and comparisons with actual performance
will be included in EAAB's Quarterly Reports to the Bank. These quantitative
objectives will include inter alia a comparison of project construction
schedules, disbursements, water production and sales, revenues per m3 of water
sales, number of employees, operating ratio and rate of return on net fixed
assets in operation (Table 6.5).
6.23      EAAB also agreed in negotiations to prepare after completion of the
project a Project Completion Report which will evaluate the extent to which
the project achieved its objectives and the efficiency of its execution. The
report is to be in conformity with guidelines to be provided by the Bank.

VII. ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL ANALYSIS
A.   Introduction
7.01      The proposed project constitutes an important component of EAAB's
and CAR's efforts to provide an integrated approach to the water supply,
sewerage, and drainage problems faced by the population of Bogota and the
pollution problems downstream in the Bogota River. Bogota's rate of popula-
tion growth is expected to remain high at about 5.8% p.a., and significant
investments in water production (Chingaza Project), currently at an advanced
stage of implementation, require complementary investments in water distri-
bution and sanitary sewerage. To improve living conditions and make more
land available for urbanization, storm water drainage investments are re-
quired. In the near future, pollution control investments must be under-
taken. The objective of the proposed project is to improve the health and
living conditions of the population of Bogota through an investment program
which includes initial measures towards meeting the above-mentioned require-
ments.
B.   Proiect Benefits
7.02      In water supply, the project will make possible the distribution
of water to be produced in existing or soon-to-be completed treatment plants.
Service levels will be maintained in areas already fully covered, while cover-
age will be extended into marginal areas where poverty groups will receive
much of the benefits (paras. 7.12 and 7.13). Sewerage networks will also be
extended into new areas, improving sanitary conditions and complementing the
expansion of the water supply network. The drainage component of the project
will benefit several areas which are flooded during periods of heavy rainfall
and where little infrastructure now exists. Drainage will decrease the hard-
ship of frequent flooding and will allow the improvement of these areas with
roads, water and sewerage networks, and other infrastructure. The residents
of these areas are largely urban poor, who, generally being owners of the
land they live on, will receive benefits in the form of both increased wealth
and better living conditions.
7.03      The studies for sewage disposal and river rectification will provide
the basis for investments in sewage treatment facilities and for improving the
flow of the Bogota River. Together, these future investments will reduce the
River's pollution and practically eliminate flooding in the city. The procure-
ment of maintenance equipment financed by the project will improve the oper-
ation and maintenance of the whole water supply and sewerage system of Bogota.
C.   Least-Cost Solution
7.04      The project components represent the least-cost solution for achiev-
ing the desired benefits. Most of the subprojects represent extensions of
existing systems and will be constructed according to existing and proven
design standards. The Tunjuelo drainage scheme proposed is the least-cost
among the three principal alternatives studied (para. 5.10).



- 45 -
D.   Incremental Rates of Return
7.05      The high population densities of the areas to receive water supply
and sewerage mean that these components are essentially complementary. In
addition, since much of the incremental population served will receive both
water supply and sewerage, these are treated as one subproject, and a combined
incremental rate of return (IRR) was calculated. The water supply and sewerage
components account for 37% of project cost, and the drainage works with sewerage
interceptors 1/ represent 32%. The estimated IRR for the water and sewerage
component is 47% and that for the drainage component is 21%, yielding a com-
bined rate of return of 37%. Incremental rates of return were not computed
for the studies, the pilot plant, the purchase of maintenance equipment, or
for two specific parts of the drainage component 2/, because of the impossi-
bility of quantifying benefits. The combined cost of these subprojects
represents 31% of the total project cost. All costs are expressed in December
1978 prices and include engineering, administration, and physical contingencies,
and are exclusive of taxes and custom duties.
7.06      Incremental rates of return for the water and sewerage component
were calculated using revenues from consumer charges as a proxy for the
economic benefits of the project. Since all positive externalities due to
improved sanitation and nutrition are not fully reflected in tariffs and
other revenues, the resulting rates of return are understated. The IRR was
calculated using December 1978 tariffs held constant in real terms. Costs and
benefits for these calculations can be found in Annex 14, page 1.
7.07      The IRR of 47% for water and sewerage is high because the project
will add to the use of existing water production capacity and sewerage
collectors and interceptors. As such, small investments in distribution mains
and networks are associated with a significant increase in consumption. The
sewerage component consists of the expansion of a network already largely
completed, so that here also large benefits are associated with minor invest-
ments in capital works. The water and sewerage component is thus fully
justified in economic terms as it represents the expanded use of existing
capacity and yields high returns.
7.08      The IRR for the drainage component has been calculated under the
assumption that its benefits can be represented by increases in land values
due to better environmental conditions. The calculation was based on cost
and benefit streams shown in Annex 14, page 2.
1/   Sewage interceptors are included with the drainage component as they are
not related to the additional sewerage connections but with the environ-
mental improvement of the areas to be drained.
2/   The drainage canal in Niza and the storm water networks amounting to an
investment of Col$126 million (20% of drainage component and 5% of total
project cost).



- 46 -
7.09      The IRR of 21% for the drainage component is higher than the country's
shadow discount rate (estimated at 11%), so that it is justified in economic
terms. In addition, the population benefitted includes a large proportion of
urban poor so that the investments are also desirable on social grounds
(paras. 7.12 and 7.13). Since the sites to be drained represent only some
4.5% of the total area of Bogota, it is expected that the availability of
these lands will not significantly affect real estate values in the rest of
the city.
E.   Long-Run Marginal Costs and Tariffs
7.10      Long-run marginal costs for water and sewerage were calculated
separately using the Average Incremental Cost (AIC) method with an 11% dis-
count rate. All costs are expressed in December 1978 prices. In both cases
non-tariff revenues (connection fees) were deducted from total costs, so that
the resulting AICs are comparable to tariffs in evaluating pricing and resource
allocation.
7.11      The AIC for water supply was estimated to be Col$2.38/m3 1/ which
is lower than the projected average tariff of about Col$5.06/m3. This is
because the former does not include the sunk cost of water production facil-
ities. The relatively high tariff is necessitated by financial consider-
ations. The AIC for sewerage recognizes a portion of costs of the new sewage
treatment plant capacity expected to be built in 1983-1990. The resulting
AIC is Col$2.40/m3 2/, which is higher than the projected average tariff for
1982 in real terms of about Col$1.47/m3. However, tariffs on volumes in
excess of the first two blocks of consumption (over 45 m3) are close to the
AIC, indicating that pricing here is roughly in line with the requirements
of efficient resource allocation. Details and assumptions for the calculation
of these AICs can be found in Annex 15.
F.   Impact on the Urban Poor
7.12      The main components of the project, i.e., water supply, sewerage,
and drainage works have a relatively higher beneficial impact on the urban
poor 3/ than on other income groups. About 95% of the population above
the urban poverty threshold was already connected to public water supply and
sewerage systems in 1978, a coverage which will be maintained during the
project. The areas into which water and sewerage networks will be extended
1/   The AIC for water calculated without deducting non-tariff revenues was
Col$2.83/m3.
2/   The AIC for sewerage calculated without deducting non-tariff revenues
was Col$2.84/m3, equivalent.
3/   Defined as families earning less than Col$42,000 annually (US$1,200) in
mid-1977 prices or approximately Col$7,600 per capita p.a., which is
one-third of the estimated per capita national income.



- 47 -
are heavily populated by families below the poverty threshold.  Most areas
to be drained similarly contain a higher proportion of urban poor than the
whole of Bogota.  It is estimated that about 75% of the families in these
areas are owners of the land they live on.  The following table illustrates
the project's impact on the urban poor.

Source: EAAB
7.13      It is estimated that in 1977 the urban poor made up 39% of Bogota's
population and this share is assumed to remain constant through 1983. The
number of urban poor with water house connections will rise from 1.0 million in
1979 to 1.5 million in 1983, with the share connected rising from 64% to 75%.
The number of poor with sewerage will rise from 0.8 million to 1.2 million,
with the share connected rising from 51% to 61% during 1979-1983. The popula-
tion affected by drainage works, with its higher-than-average 55% share below
the poverty threshold, will benefit from better sanitary conditions, higher
values of their land, and from the opportunity for upgrading the infrastructure
of their neighborhoods. The share of the loan attributable to providing services
to the urban poor is estimated at 32% 1/.
7.14      The poor population remaining unconnected to a water supply or
sewerage system in 1983 generally will be living outside the sanitary peri-
meter where distances and low population densities make network extensions
uneconomic. The explicit policy of EAAB is to provide these areas with
potable water through public standpipes, and to encourage the application
1/   About 90% of the water and sewerage networks to be constructed by EAAB
are for the urban poor, since networks for the rest of the population
are normally built by private urban developers. The cost of water mains
was distributed in proportion to estimated consumption. The cost of
drainage and interceptors was distributed according to the estimated
share of urban poor living in the areas of influence and owning the land
they live on. For Tunjuelo, the area of vacant land was deducted since
the income levels of the owners are unknown.



- 48 -
of individual solutions in the sanitation field, such as latrines and septic
tanks. EAAB will expand its water supply and sewerage networks into new areas
when population densities are sufficiently high to justify the investment.
7.15      An evaluation of the affordability of water supply and sewerage
services was made based on 1978 tariffs. In 1978 an extremely poor family
earning around Col$22,800 (US$590) a year would pay 2.7% of its income for
minimum acceptable consumption of water (15 m3) and sewerage services, while
those with incomes of Col$45,600 (US$1,170) would pay 2.2%. Both water and
sewerage tariffs are projected to remain roughly constant in real terms during
the 1980's. Therefore, the services are currently affordable to this group,
and are expected to remain so in the future.
7.16      Under the current tariff structure most residential consumers, and
especially low-income ones, are subsidized by high-volume consumers and by
commercial and industrial users. In the payment of initial connection charges,
new consumers in low-income areas are charged less per connection and are
granted payment terms of ten years at 10% per annum interest, while others are
charged 18% per annum interest for payment in one to four years. EAAB has
thus been attempting to make water supply and sewerage services available and
affordable to the poor, and intends to continue these policies in the future.
G.   Project Sensitivity and Risks
7.17      The rate of return for the water and sewerage component is fairly
sensitive to changes in costs and benefits. However, revenues are not ex-
pected to deviate significantly from those projected since no major real
tariff increases appear to be required and the composition of consumption is
expected to remain basically unchanged. Investment works are straightforward,
and significant cost overruns are not likely. In addition, the IRR calculated
is so high that the possibility of it falling to unacceptable levels is
negligible. The rate of return for the drainage component is highly sensitive
to changes in costs and benefits. A 20% increase in costs lowers the return
from 21% to 12%, while a 20% decrease in benefits gives 10%. A 10% increase
in costs combined with a 10% decrease in benefits yields a return of 11%
(Annex 14, page 2).
7.18      The project works are of conventional design and well within the
capability of local civil works contractors to construct.  Design is at an
advanced stage and it is therefore expected that the works can be completed
on schedule and within the cost estimate.  EAAB's external and internal cash
resources are expected to be adequate to meet the costs of the ongoing
Chingaza Project as well as the proposed project. The project is considered
to be of high priority by the Bogota City Government, and the implementing
agency, EAAB, is fully competent to supervise its construction. In summary,
there is a high degree of certainty that the project works will provide the
desired benefits, within the project cost estimate and on schedule.

VIII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
8.01      During loan negotiations assurances were obtained from EAAB
on the following principal points:
(a) that satisfactory arrangements for collection and remittance
of valorization levies to EAAB will be worked out with IDU
(para. 6.13);
(b) that EAAB will maintain the following rates of return on net
revalued fixed assets in operation: 7% in 1979 and 1980,
5% in 1981 and 1982, and 6% in subsequent years (para. 6.17);
(c) that quarterly reports on the progress of the project and on
operating and financial performance will be submitted by EAAB
to the Bank (para. 6.22);
(d) that on completion of the project a Project Completion Report
will be prepared (para. 6.23); and
(e) that the Bank will have the opportunity to comment prior to any
major structural reorganization of EAAB; and that any amendment
to the EAAB charter which would adversely affect EAAB's operations
or finances, without prior Bank agreement, would constitute a
default of the loan (para. 4.08).
8.02      As agreement was reached on the above conditions, it is recommended
that a Bank loan of US$30.0 million be made for the project. The terms
would be 17 years' maturity, including 4 years' grace.

THIRD BOGOTA WATER SUPPLY, SEWERAGE AND DRAINAGE PROJECT
Existing EAAB Water Supply, Sewerage and
Drainage System
General
1.        Bogota has a modern water supply system which serves 86% of the
population with metered connections. The remainder of the population, which
for the most part is located outside of the sanitary perimeter, is served by
public standpipes supplied by main extensions from the city's system, cisterns
which store rainwater, and shallow wells. There are three water supply
systems with full treatment which account for 99% of the total supply capacity.
The Bogota River and its tributaries are the source of supply for these
systems. The remaining supply capacity consists of small intakes located in
the hills to the east of the city. Water from these sources receives chlori-
nation only. The Chingaza Project, now under construction, will more than
double the available supply. This water will receive full treatment.
2.        The city has both sanitary and storm water drainage systems within
the boundaries of the sanitary district. The systems are separate except in
the area of the old city where they are combined. Sewage is discharged raw
into the Bogota River and its tributaries.
3.        The Map (page 97) shows the more important features of the water,
sewer and drainage systems. Details of the systems are tabulated in the
tables at the end of this Annex and explained below.
Water Supply
4.        The principal water supply systems and their capacities are as

5.        The Tibito system obtains the major part of its water from an intake
on the Bogota River, 35 km north of the city upstream of the section where
industrial and domestic wastes pollute the River. The River at the intake
is partially regulated by three reservoirs in the upper river basin with
storage totalling 890 million m3. These reservoirs belong to and are operated
by EEEB and CAR, but a joint commission of EAAB, EEEB and CAR coordinates the
releases according to the needs of the three entities. Water is also diverted
from the Teusaca River to the treatment plant at Tibito. The combined
yield of both sources is 10.0 m3/sec.
6.        The Tibito water treatment plant provides flocculation, sedimentation
and filtration. The plant was originally designed for 4.0 m3/sec with a
provision to double its capacity to 8.0 m3/sec by duplicating all installa-
tions; however, between 1972 and 1976 the capacity was increased to 12.0 m3/sec
by adding only new flocculation sedimentation capacity, replacing the sand
inthe existing filter basins with dual filter media (antracite and sand) and
introducing more efficient operating rules.
7.        Two raw water pumping stations pump water from the Bogota River to
the plant and a third raw water pumping station pumps water from the Teusaca
River. Treated water can either flow by gravity from the filter well through
parallel 60" and 78" pipelines to the city or can be pumped to a treated
water reservoir at Tibito. The 60"' pipeline terminates at the Usaquen pumping
station in the city. The combined capacity of both pipelines with booster
pumping is 15.0 m3/sec.
8.        The Tunjuelo supply system is an all-gravity system which withdraws
water from the Regadera reservoir on the Tunjuelo River, 25 km south of the
city. Water from the reservoir is treated at a plant at Vitelma. This
treatment plant is directly connected with the distribution system and serves
most of the highlying areas along the eastern city limits.
9.        The San Cristobal, San Francisco and the other minor intakes on the
hills east of the city are of little significance compared to the Tibito
system. The San Cristobal supply is connected by gravity to the Vitelma
treatment plant. The San Francisco system has its own small treatment plant
located at San Diego. The other systems which serve isolated high-lying
sections of the city are provided with chlorination as the only means of
treatment.

10.       The Chingaza system is currently under construction.  The first
stage, which will be completed in 1980, will increase the city's supply
capacity by 14 m3/sec to a total of 25.6 m3/sec. Its main feature is the
diversion of water from the Chingaza area, a previously almost inaccessible
watershed 40 km east of Bogota, through a series of tunnels and conduits.
The principal components of the works currently under construction are:
(a) a dam and reservoir on the Chuza River above its confluence
with the Guatiquia River. The storage volume will be
200 million m3;
(b) a 45 km conveyance system between the Chuza reservoir and
Bogota consisting primarily of tunnels 3.7 m in diameter;
(c) a water treatment plant at El Sapo, with a capacity of
14 m3/sec expandable to 22 m3/sec in the future;
(d) 100 km of access roads; and
(e) a run of the river diversion from the Guatiquia River which
consists of a 3.5 km tunnel from the Guatiquia River to the
Chuza reservoir and related intake works.
Treated water from the plant clearwell will flow by gravity through a short
tunnel and pipe system to the Usaquen and Parque Nacional storage tanks.
Water Distribution
11.       The city is divided into three distribution zones (low, intermediate,
and high). The low zone supplied by the Tibito treatment plant is by far
the largest, serving about 70% of the city's area. The intermediate zone
forms a narrow band between the two other zones and supplies approximately
10% of the city area. It is connected to the Parque Nacional tank which
receives some water by gravity from the Vitelma treatment plant and some
from the Tibito water treatment plant by the booster pumping station at
Usaquen. The high zone, representing about 20% of the city area, is supplied
by the Vitelma and San Diego treatment plants.
12.       The total length of distribution system pipe is 4,200 km including
the two tranmission lines from the Tibito treatment plant. Pipes range in
size from 3" to 78". The majority of the pipes (94%) are 14" and smaller.
Commonly used pipe materials are galvanized iron for diameters 3" and smaller,
asbestos cement for diameters 4"-12", and prestressed concrete for pipes
24" and larger.
13.       Distribution storage capacity is 334,000 m3.  The major part of this
capacity is located in the low pressure zone.

Sewerage and Drainage Systems
14.       About 30X of the area of Bogota, the older part of the city, has a
combined sewage and storm water drainage system. The rest of the city is
served by separate systems. These systems, including the combined system
serving the older part of the city, are divided into four main sectors. These
sectors correspond to the drainage basis of the following small streams which
are tributaries to the Bogota River: Torca, Salitre, Fucha and Tunjuelo.
The sewerage and drainage master plan provides for the canalization of these
streams and the construction of parallel sanitary sewer interceptors to
collect all sewage discharges.
15.       A recent addition to the drainage system is a series of concrete
line canals constructed along the eastern perimeter of the city at the base
of the hills. These canals are designed to trap sediment and debris which,
if washed downsteam, would clog the drainage channels of the middle of the
city and cause flooding. Parts of this system are still under construction.

THIRD BOGOTA WATER SUPPLY, SEWERAGE AND DRAINAGF PROJECT
Status of Chingaza Project Execution
1.        The 120 m high dam necessary to impound the water from Chingaza
watershed and 80% of the 38 km length of tunnels necessary to convey the
water to Bogota have been completed. The 7 km pipeline section of the
transmission system will start soon and the water treatment plant and treated
water storage tanks are under construction. All the works are expected to
be completed by early 1981.
2.        The critical activity in the project is the excavation of a 6.5 km
section of tunnel remaining to complete the 18.5 km section between Chuza
and Ventana. To complete this work by the end of June 1980 (allowing
6 months for lining) it will be necessary to progress in the two headings of
this section at a rate of 13 m per working day. The average rate accomplished
to date is only 9 m per working day. This low average has been the result
of difficult geological conditions encountered in the other sections.
Geological studies seem to indicate that the characteristics of the rock
for the remaining excavation are good so that the higher rate of progress
may be attainable.
3.         The project is three years behind the original schedule.  The major
reason for the delay is the difficulties encountered in the construction of
the tunnels. The first contractor had to be replaced because of substantial
slippages with regard to the schedule. Considerable time was expended in
settling the termination of the first contract and in rebidding the work.
The new contractor is performing better, but he is having difficulty with
the geological formation through which the tunnel has to be excavated and has
asked for a 15-month extension of the contract completion date. Due to a
water demand growth lower than that anticipated, these delays are not likely
to produce any substantial water shortage in Bogota. The completion of the
remaining 1.1 km of the 10 km Ventana-Simaya stretch will allow the catchment
of some in-route water sources that could help cope with the immediate increase
in water demand in case of a further slippage in the completion of the critical
Chuza-Ventana stretch.
4.        The project has projected cost overruns of about 60% (US$189 million
versus US$118 million at the appraisal time). The disbursement percentages
of the loan have been repeatedly reduced to assure Bank participation in
the project until its completion. The cost overrun is to be covered by
internal cash generation and a foreign exchange loan in 1979.

THIRD BOGOTA WATER SUPPLY, SEWEPAGE AND DRAINAGE PROJECT
DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT
General
1.        The project represents EAAB's total investment program for the
period 1979 to 1982. The program includes water, sewer and drainage system
additions and improvements, equipment purchases and studies.
Primary Water Distribution System Extensions and Reinforcements
2.        The Chingaza Project will add an additional 14.0 m3/sec to the supply
capacity of the water system. The proposed extensions and reinforcements will
increase the capacity of the system to distribute additional water. They
will also improve pressures in existing parts of the system where demands
have increased recently and extend service to areas of new development.
3.        The proposed mains range in size from 12" to 42".  The locations
are shown on the Map (page 97). The lengths, according to diameter, are as
follows:
Diameter                  Length

Sewerage and Drainage Improvements
4.        The sewerage and drainage works included in the project are part of
an ongoing program to separate sanitary wastes from storm water drainage and to
prevent localized flooding. The basis for the project elements presently
under construction and the elements proposed for Bank financing is a master
plan prepared by Camp, Dresser & McKee in 1961 and studies prepared by EAAB
and local consultants during the past 16 years. The 1961 study included only
the Salitre and Fucha systems. The proposed project for the Tunjuelo River
is the result of an initial study in 1970 by APRON, a local firm, and a second
study by a joint venture headed by Camp, Dresser & McKee in 1974.
5.        Prior to the beginning of the present construction program, sanitary
sewers and storm water drains discharged to the main stems of the three river
systems which drain the Bogota Plains, the Salitre, the Fucha and the Tunjuelo.

ANNEX 6
Page 2 of 5
Except for the old city area, sewerage and drainage systems are separate, up
to the point where the two systems discharge into the main streams of the
three rivers. As a result, the rivers are now nothing more than open sewers.
In addition to being a sanitary hazard, the natural channels of the three
rivers lack sufficient capacity to accommodate the high rates of storm water
runoff which have resulted from urbanization. Flooding of large sections of
the city during heavy rainfalls is a common occurrence.
6.        The Master Plan developed by the 1961 and 1974 studies recommended
canalization of the main stems of the Salitre and Fucha Rivers, the construction
of a storm water retention reservoir on the Tunjuelo River and straightening
of the Bogota River. A smaller storm water retention reservoir was proposed
for the Cordoba River, a tributary of the Salitre River.
7.        To eliminate pollution in the newly constructed canals and in the
Bogota River, the plan proposed to parallel the new canals and the Bogota
River with sewerage interceptors. The Bogota River interceptor would serve
as the city s main interceptor and discharge into a large sewage treatment
plant southwest of the city. The straightening of the Bogota River, the
Bogota River interceptor and the treatment plant are still under study and
will be studied further under this project (see paras. 13-15).
8.        Implementation of the approved part of the master plan was begun in
1974 and has proceeded from the upstream end of each drainage basin down. It
is proposed to extend the canals and parallel interceptors only within the
limits of the sanitary perimeter. Beyond the boundary of the zone, flooding
results from the backwater of the Bogota River, and canalization to increase
runoff capacity would not prevent flooding.
9.        Considering only the improvement of the three tributary systems, 70%
of the program is either completed or under construction. The works to be
financed by the Bank loan will complete the program. The map at the end of
the report shows the location of the portions of the program to be financed by
the Bank loan.
10.       Characteristics of the components to be financed by the Bank loan
are as follows:

Water Supply, Sewage and Drainage for Low-Income Barrios
11.       There are a number of areas inside the sanitary district boundaries
which developed without the construction of proper utilities. The project
includes construction of water systems in 24 barrios with an aggregate pipe
length of about 80 km, sewerage systems in 55 barrios with an aggregate pipe
length of about 150 km and drainage systems in 18 barrios. The location of
the barrios to be served is shown on the Map.
Purchase of Water Meters and Maintenance Equipment
12.       In order to improve system operations, EAAB intends to purchase
the following items of equipment:
(a) water meters (215,000) for new connections and replacement;
(b) sewer and drain cleaning equipment, including equipment
that will allow the cleaning of drain inlets during daylight
hours;

ANNEX 6
Page 4 of 5
(c) television cameras for sewer and drain inspection;
(d) radio communications system for Operations Department vehicles;
(e) construction-type equipment, such as backhoes, trenchers,
truckmounted cranes and bulldozers. This equipment would be
used on repair work and for keeping drainage canals free of
debris and silt. It is not intended for new construction;
(f) machine tools for fabricating replacement parts; and
(g) replacement vehicles for trucks and automobiles dating back
to 1973 and earlier.
Pollution Abatement Study
13.       The discharge of untreated domestic and industrial wastes into
tributaries of the Bogota River has caused a serious pollution problem down-
stream of the city. This pollution poses a threat to the health of persons
living in communities which use the River for drinking and irrigation and is
even affecting the use for fishing and recreation of the Magdalena River,
which the Bogota River joins 200 km south of the city.
14.       The problem is not new.  In 1974 Camp, Dresser & McKee made a
study of the pollution problem and recommended the construction of an
interceptor paralleling the Bogota River, terminating at a major treatment
plant where the river leaves the Plains. This was one of three alternatives
studied.  The other two were:
(a) build three separate treatment plants, one for each of
the major interceptors; and
(b) construct the Bogota River interceptors included in the
recommended plan with treatment in Tocaima, which is
located at a low elevation on the plain below Bogota.
EAAB is concerned that the above study did not adequately address the finan-
cial feasibility of the recommended plan or clearly identify the economic,
social and ecological benefits of providing treatment. To answer existing
doubts concerning the benefits of treatment and reexamine the alternatives in
the light of today's conditions, a new study of the entire pollution problem
has been proposed.
15.       The proposed study would include the following:
(a) a receiving water study to measure by sampling and flow
measurement the existing condition of the Bogota River,
estimate the future condition without treatment and
project the effect of various levels of treatment under
present and future conditions;



- 66 -
ANNEX 6
Page 5 of 5
(b) an industrial waste survey to determine the type and quantity
of wastes now being discharged, future industrial waste
quantities and the need and effect of controls on industrial
waste discharges;
(c) laboratory scale treatment studies to determine treatability
and develop design criteria for treatment;
(d) design, construction and operation of a pilot plant to test
and refine the proposed design criteria;
(e) reexamination of alternatives proposed in the 1974 study
and the evaluation of economic, social and ecological
benefits using the data developed in steps (a) through
(d) above; and
(f) preparation of designs for the first stage of the recommended
program of works.
Bogota River Flood Control - Preliminary Design
16.       Although the canalization of the three tributaries draining into
the Bogota River will reduce flooding, the flooding of the Bogota River
main stem must be solved to completely eliminate the problem.  The controlling
agencies have all agreed on the solution which is to straighten and deepen
the River channel. The next step is to develop preliminary designs and
cost estimates and arrange for financing.
17.       This project will be supervised by CAR.  The cost will be shared
equally among CAR, EAAB and EEEB. EAAB will use proceeds of the loan
to pay its share of the cost.

THIRD BOGOTA WATER SUPPLY, SEWERAGE AND DRAINAGE PROJECT
COST ESTIMATES
1.   Exchange rate:  Col$1 = US$0.0245
2.   Base date for estimates:  December 1978
3.   Base cost estimates:
(a) Civil construction costs for water mains, sewer interceptors,
drainage canals and the Tunjuelo Flood Control Project are
based on quantity take-offs from either advanced preliminary
designs or final designs. Unit prices are based on recent
bids for similar work received during 1977 and updated to
December 1978 on an item-by-item basis. Material costs are
based on supplier quotations as of June 1978 updated to
December 1978. The foreign cost component of the civil
construction includes both direct and indirect costs. Direct
costs include the cost of materials to be imported. Indirect
costs include an estimate of the depreciation cost of heavy
equipment most likely to be used on each project;
(b) Equipment and meter supply costs are based on June 1978
quotations from suppliers increased to December 1978
prices. Prices are CIF Barranquilla with an allowance for
overland freight and agent's fees. All prices are free
of duties and taxes since the EAAB enjoys tax-free status;
(c) Land acquisition costs are based on preliminary surveys
and land value estimates made by EAAB in early 1978 and
increased to December 1978 prices;
(d) Consultants' costs are for hiring consulting engineers for
detailed designs, construction, supervision and feasibility
studies included in the project. Costs are based on man-month
estimates and prevailing prices as of June 1978 and increased
to December 1978. The project contains an estimated 1,372
man-months of which 1,322 are expected to be local and 50 foreign
with an average cost of US$3,450 per man-month (US$3,200 per
man-month for local and US$10,000 for foreign). The cost of
engineering and construction supervision and inspection
by the EAAB staff has been included as a project cost, but
not considered for the calculation of the loan amount; and

(e) Study cost estimates have been based on man-month estimates
for specific tasks and material supply requirements for
the laboratory and field work. Consulting costs are based
on recent contracts for similar type work. Local consulting
costs are assumed to be 50% foreign currency. Foreign
consulting costs are assumed to be 100% foreign cost.
4.        Physical contingencies:  10% for all contracts.
Price contingencies:
(a)  local inflation rate:    1979 - 22%
1980 - 20%
thereafter - 16%
(b)  foreign inflation rate:  6.0% for all years
(c) Exchange rates:
mid 1979    US$1.00        Col$43.62
mid 1980    US$1.00        Col$49.34

EAAB Charges for Service Connections
House Connection Fee (Derecho de Matricula):
A payment of 3% of the cadastral value of the lot and
improvements is billed to the applicant for a water connection.
As initial payment, the applicant is required to pay 3.8%
of the estimated construction cost of the house or building.
Low-income owners may have the payment made in installments.
Connection Cost:
The nonconsumer is required to reimburse EAAB the actual cost
of installing the connection. For low-income consumers,
extended payment terms may be given.
Network Connection Fee (Derecho de Suministro):
To contribute to the cost of the main distributing system, a
land developer pays an average of Col$16.90 (this figure may
vary with population density) for each square meter of
saleable land. In the case of low-income population areas,
this fee may be reduced by 50% and a payment term of ten
years may be allowed.
Network Cost:
When networks are installed by a land developer, the cost is
recovered through the selling price of the lot. The networks
are subsequently donated to EAAB. In areas where networks have
not been constructed, EAAB makes the installation after receiving
30% of the cost from the community and allows ten years for pay-
ment of the remaining 70%. The property in which the networks
are installed also passes to EAAB.

Notes on Financial Statements and Projections
Inflation and Exchange Rates
1.        Estimated rates of inflation and the exchange rate between
the US dollar and the Colombian peso for the years 1978 through 1985
are as follows:
International      Domestic          Average
Rate of          Rate of          Exchange
Year             Inflation        Inflation           Rate   a/
1979               6.0%             20.0%            43.62
1980               6.0%             20.0%            49.34
1981               6.0%             20.0%            55.83
1982               6.0%             16.0%            62.32
1983               6.0%             16.0%            68.11
1984               6.0%             16.0%            74.45
1985               6.0%             16.0%            81.37
a/ Colombian pesos/US dollar
2.        These rates have been applied to operating expenses, capital
expenditures, asset and debt revaluation, and debt repayments to place
them on a current Colombian peso basis.
Revenues
3.        Revenues have not been escalated in accordance with the above rates.
They have been derived from water sales projections based on constant per
capita consumption of 196 lcpd and projected population growth and service
levels (Annex 2). Tariffs have been derived from 1978 actual average
tariffs for water and sewerage combined plus a one time adjustment of 9%
in 1979 as a result of upward reclassification of consumers, and a 1% per
month increase in tariffs through December 31, 1979 and 1 1/2% monthly
through 1985. Connection fees have been based on 1978 rates escalated in
line with inflation, which is the historical growth and the number of
expected connections in each year (Annex 2). Other revenues have been
projected to grow at 10% p.a. which is their historical rate of increase.
Expenses
4.        Production requirements have been derived from water sales pro-
jections and assumed unaccounted-for water levels (Annex 2). Production

costs have been estimated on a unit basis for EAAB's existing and future
treatment plants and have been escalated in line with inflation and
multiplied by the annual volumes to obtain total production costs. All
other operating and administrative expenses have been escalated annually
by percentages equivalent to the increase in water sales plus the annual
rate of inflation. Charges for pensions and other reserves have been
estimated by EAAB's actuary. Depreciation has been based on a composite
rate reflecting straight line amortization of assets over their useful
lives which ranges from five years for vehicles to 75 years for tunnels.
Interest and Debt Service
5.        Interest is all on foreign exchange debt and reflects actual terms
for existing loans and 8% with 17 years maturity including four years' grace
for the proposed loan. The new foreign exchange loan is assumed to have an
11% interest rate with a 12-year maturity including a five-year grace period.
All interest during construction is assumed to be capitalized.
Capital Expenditures
6.        Capital expenditures include the expenditures under the project
(Annex 8), expenditures on the Chingaza Project (1979 and 1980)9 works
constructed by land developers and donated to EAAB, and capitalized
interest and planning and development costs.
Working Capital
7.        Working capital has been based on accounts receivable equivalent
to four months' sales in 1979 and 3 1/2 months' sales in subsequent years
(current water sales equivalent to two months' sales, and the remainder
for connection fees and network costs) and inventories based on estimates
of requirements in conformity with project construction and completion
schedules. Current liabilities have been projected to increase in line
with operating inventory requirements.
Consumer Contributions/Valorization
8.        Consumer contributions have been based on the expected number of new
consumer connections and network construction by developers which are donated
to EAAB. The former are assumed to be collected 30% on connection and the
balance over ten years. The latter will be collected at one time in the year
donated. Valorization is assumed to be collected over a six-year period which
is the legal and common practice for payment of these levies.
Fixed Assets and Rate Base
9.        Fixed assets and construction in progress are escalated in line
with general inflation rates. Assets are transferred to fixed assets in



- 83 -
ANNEX 13
Page 6 of 6
the year of completion. The rate base is the average value of net fixed
assets in operation for the year, less 16-19% which is the estimated
value of assets financed by consumer contributions.
Long-term Debt
10.       All long-term debt is foreign exchange debt stated in current
Colombian pesos in line with the inflation and exchange rates previously
given.
Net Worth
11.       Paid in capital includes the original contributions of the city
of Bogota plus works donated to EAAB. Retained earnings accumulate annual
net income. These items are not adjusted for inflation. The difference
between the increases in asset values and long-term debt liabilities is
reflected in the revaluation surplus account.

1/ See pages 6 throughlo of this Annex for details and assumptions in the calculation of benefits. Phasing of investments is as
planned in this project. Benefits estimated as the increase in land values due to drainage and interceptors.
Notes: All four components of this subproject yield high or acceptable rates of return. Except in the case of Fucha, moderate decreases
in benefits and increases in costs do not result in low IRR's. The IRR for Fucha is relatively low because the price of urbanized
land in that area is expected to be lower than that in Torca and Cordoba.  The latter are prestigious residential areas, while                                                                  ,  >
both Fucha and Tunjuelo are less prestigious.  Because of this factor, it is likely that the estimated increase in land values in                                                               S  a
Fucha and Tunjuelo does not measure the full beneficial impact of the project on environmental conditions.  Considering that these                                                                 >e
areas contain a large share of low and middle-income residents the relatively low final price of land also does not reflect the                                                                     H
positive social impact of the project.  In Tunjuelo the IRR is relatively high regardless of the low final land values because
land values before the project are much lower than in other areas, as there is very little infrastructure and a large poor popu-                                                                o

a/  Incremental costs due to operations and maintenance were calculated using unit costs of Col$2.36/m3 for water and Col$0.66/m3
equivalent for sewerage. These were derived from operating costs for 1978 under the assumptions that: (1) 15% of the total
cost of operation and maintenance was fixed costs which will not increase due to the project; and (2) 85% of the remaining cost
was due to water supply operation and 15% for sewerage.

THIRD BOGOTA WATER SUPPLY, SEWERAGE AND DRAINAGE PROJECT
Calculations of Benefits for Drainage Subproject
(all values in Dec.-1978 prices)
TORCA
A. Data: (1) Total area: 320 ha
(2) Value of land in 1978: Col$3.1 million/ha
(3) Value of fully urbanized land: Col$16.8 million/ha
(4) Drainage investments: Col$74.3 million
(5) Interceptor investments: Col$27.6 million
(6) Cost of other infrastructure (roads, water,
electricity, etc.): Col$1,430 million
B. Calculations
(1) Of the total area drained, only 60% is available
for private construction, as the rest is taken up
by roads, parks, etc. It is assumed that land
values of the available 60% reflect the benefit of
having the public lands nearby.
(2) Thus, the value of the whole area in 1978 is 0.60 x
320 x 3.1 = Col$595 million.
(3) The value of this land after drainage and full
urbanization is 0.60 x 320 x 16.8 = Col$3,226 million.
(4) The value added by drainage and urbanization is
therefore 3,226 - 595 = Col$2,631 million.

(5) In order to estimate benefits due to the drainage and
interceptor investments alone, it is assumed that these are
proportionate to the amount of investment as follows:
B  drainage + interceptor investments
Benefit Drainage + Interceptor =   all infrastructure investment          X
Value added by drainage and urbanization
74.3 + 27.6
74.3 + 27.6 + 1,430  X  2,631 = Col$175.0 million
(6) Since the project will be completed in 1982, the benefits
have been assigned to the year 1983. Note that even though
the land may be sold and urbanized over a longer
period, the benefits of drainage itself come immediately
after project completion.

(6) Interceptor investments: Col$147.5 million
(7) Cost of other infrastructure (all zones together):
Col$1,690 million.
B. Calculations (not analogous to preceding)
(1)  The benefit of drainage is estimated as the difference in
land values of 1978 and those for drained but unurbanized
land.
(2)  The value of these areas before drainage is:
Alta:   108 x 0.224 = Col$24.2 million
Media: 220 x 0.224 = Col$49.3 million
Baja:   150 x 0.224 = Col$33.6 million
Total            Col$107.1 million
(3)  In these areas there is practically no public land so
that the prices noted in A (2) and (3) refer to land
without roads, parks, etc. The benefits per hectare
found in B (2), therefore, apply to the full area
to be drained, and not to 60% as in the previous
three cases.
(4)  In the zones "Alta" and "Media," however, 10% of the
area will be taken up by drainage works themselves
(canal border zones). Thus, the value of these lands
after drainage is:
Alta:   0.90 x 108 x 0.67 = Col$65.0 million
Media: 0.90 x 220 x 1.07 = Col$211.0 million
Baja:           150 x 1.40 = Col$210.0 million
Total                   Col$486.0 million.
(5) Thus, the benefit due to drainage alone is:
486.0 - 107.1 = Col$378.9 million.

(6)  The estimate of benefits of the interceptor investments
is analogous to the methodology applied in the casas of
Torca, Cordoba, and Fucha. The benefits here are
calculated for all the zones together.
(7)  Value of land after drainage but unurbanized (from B (4)):
Col$486.0 million.
(8)  In estimating the value of land after interceptor investments
and other urbanization, we again take 60% of the land
as the price in A (4) refers to land available for private
use.
(9)  Thus the value of the area after full urbanization will be:
Alta:   0.60 x 0.90 x 108 x 11.2 = Col$  653.2 million
Media:  0.60 x 0.90 x 220 x 11.2 = Col$1,330.6 million
Baja:   0.60 x 150  x 11.2          = Col$1,008.0 million
Total                           Col$2,991.8 million
(10)  The value added due to interceptors and urbanization is
thus: 2,991.8 - 486.0 = Col$2,505.8 million
(11)  The benefit due to interceptor works alone is estimated
as follows:
147.5 + 1,690 x 2,505.8 = Col$201.1 million
(12)  Finally, the benefit of drainage and interceptors is
201.1 + 378.9 = Col$580.0 million.
(13)  As the works will be completed in 1982, the full benefits
have been assigned to 1983.

a) Up to and including 1985, a unit cost of Col$2.36/m3 was used, derived as explained in Annex 14 page 5. For increments
after 1985 the unit cost of operation in the new plant at El Sapo  was used, i.e. Col$2.09/m3.  This plant
starts production in 1981, but we have conservatively allocated initial incremental production to the old
plants, shifting to the new plant only when the planned maximum capacity of the old plants is reached in 1985.
b) The conservative approach noted above was dictated by the fact that the (sunk) cost of the El Sapo plant is
not included in this calculation. After 1982 investments were projected using a cost of Col$1,534 per additional
connection; in 1986 there is an additional investment of Col$17-1 million.
c) Non-tariff Revenues. These connection fees are paid in one to ten years at varying rates of interest. Here
each year shows the present value in that year of the repayment stream starting then, and calculated with
an 11% discount rate. The annual amounts therefore do not correspond to those in page 5 of Annex 14, where
the actual repayments stream is shown for connections made during 1980-1983.
d) the above investments reach full capacity utilization around 1990, after which incremental values are held
constant.
e) includes plant investments in 1978 and 1979 not in Bank project.

Calculation of Average Incremental Cost
The AIC for water is:
3,249.0 + 368.7 = Col$2.83/m3
1276.4
However, the measure of AIC which is comparable to tariffs should
exclude consumer payments in the form of non-tariff revenues.
Thus this measure of AIC becomes:
3,249.0 + 368.7 - 583.4
1276.4               = Col$2.38/m3
