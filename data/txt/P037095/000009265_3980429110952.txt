Block A: Project Description
1. Project development objectives: (See Annex 1 for Key Performance Indicators)
The project objective is to alleviate poverty in rural and coastal areas of Maluku and generate economic growth
through:
1. investment in tree crops, food crops, processing of commodities, and provision of support services.
2. Increasing access to credit for income-generating activities;
3. Meeting village demand for small-scale infrastructure for water supply, sanitation, village jetties, drainage,
sea walls, feeder roads, and bridges.
4. Overcoming transportation and marketing constraints through investment in sea transportation and storage.
Rationale for Objectives:
Maluku has a well-endowed agriculture and marine resource base with rich soils, adequate rainfall (especially in
the central and northern areas), widespread smallholder coconut estates, low population densities and relatively large
farms. The rural economy is dependent on agriculture and fisheries with a high share of subsistence consumption. A
major constraint is the geographic distribution of the population which is spread around the circumference of islands
which are themselves widely scattered. These features affect the concentration of markets and effective demand, the
efficiency of service delivery, the diffusion of technology and the availabi]lity of credit. The approach to surmount these
obstacles combines interventions which: (a) emphasize village planning and execution and use modest inputs; (b) add
value through processing prior to transportation and reduce losses due 1o disease, pests and storage; (c) relax credit
constraints; and (d) improve sea transportation and market linkages. Productivity can also be enhanced by replanting and
intensifying aging estate crops. This strategy would be complemented by village-based infrastructure to improve welfare
and market access.
2. Project Components: (See Annex 2 for detailed description and Annex 3 for cost breakdown.)

Country: ][NDONESIA                        Project Title: MALUKU REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Commenits on Project Components: (See Annex 2 for Details.)
1. Tree crops development and replanting based on coconuts and coffee.  Copra production accounts for up to
60% of cash income for many coastal villages. The small-holder coconut area (90% of the total) has expanded by more
than one-third over the last six years in the target areas, often using poorly-selected traditional varieties without any
fertilizer application. Yields are declining, after adjustment for newly planted areas, due to aging and non-productive
trees. About 60% of the coconut trees on Halmahera, the northern island, are estimated to be over 30 years old; more
than 20% of the trees in central Maluku are classified as older and non-productive. Two tree crops projects have
successfully financed hybrids in the province (one modified at the end to include local varieties). However, in some
areas traditional varieties are preferable, desired by farmers and recommended by agriculturists due to their longer
production life, lower input requirements and resistance to disease. Rehabilitation of existing groves through replanting
and intensification would complement the initiatives of other projects and reduce trends to expand onto new land.
Traditional varieties are being widely planted now without proper selection of motherstock and without any fertilizer
inputs in the early years which limits their potential. The project would offer a choice between hybrid and local tall
coconuts, in pure stands or intercropped with coffee, by providing one year of inputs on a grant basis and two years of
loans. Rather than the typical model of loan repayment to the Ministry of Finance, here repayment would be into
revolving village accounts, supplementing community development funds. Food or forage crops would generate more
immediate income and partly off-set the disadvantage of delayed production from tree crops.
2. Community Development. Village proposals for small-scale infrastructure from a recommended list of
possibilities would be selected for funding at the kecamatan level. High-demand examples are village water supply and
drainage. About 60% of target area villages would benefit from infrastructure grants (initially Rp. 100 million
maximum). Credits for income-generating village enterprises, not necessarily to the same villages, would be made on a
competitive selection basis. These funds would be a grant to the village for on-lending to groups or organizations on a
revolving credit basis to be repaid at "market" rates. The coverage would be similar to infrastructure grants and the
initial credit to a group limited to Rp. 50 million. Typical enterprises would be technology adoption for pest and disease
control, post-harvest processing, or community-scale coconut oil mills, coconut wood sawmills, cacao dryers, tree crop
nurseries, or rice/corn hullers. Lending to fishing groups would be strictly limited to fish drying, fish smoking, ice
production, fish ponds, shipping, cold boxes, etc., and would not finance new gear, boats, or increased fishing
exploitation. Repayment of funds for income generation would be to a village account controlled by the Village
Develcpment Council (LKMD). Because of large, outside investments in irrigation development in transmigration
areas, transmigration villages would not be eligible for these grants. Seed multiplication under the next component
would benefit transmigration areas.
3. Support Services for Agriculture and Fisheries. This component would finance: (1) Marketing support and
processing demonstrations and assistance with enterprise proposals (copra processing, coconut log milling, fish drying
and smoking, essential oil extraction, cacao drying, etc.); (2) Animal health services for Newcastle's disease (chickens),
scabies in goats, and septicemia and parasites in livestock; upgrading of Rural Extension Centers and training of staff and
farmers; (3) Technology diffusion for cacao pod borer, top rot in coconuts, post harvest technology, and other
agricultural practices (no new research would be financed since diffusion is emphasized); (4) Fisheries support would be
provided through profiles of about 20 major species in Maluku based on existing information and containing
recommendations on management and development opportunities. Funds would be provided on a contingent basis for
on-shore sites and services to support fisheries and attract private investment. Their release and utilization would depend
on the recommendations of the fisheries profiles. (5) Seed multiplication for irrigated agriculture.
4. Sea Transportation and On-Shore Facilities. Significant transportation delays, higher marketing costs and
spoilage are the result of inadequate or non-existent docks and storage in some areas. Goods are loaded into small boats
and transferred to larger ones, or carried to shore by hand. This becomes impossible in high seas. At larger sites,
existing docks are unable to handle the cargo and loaded (or empty ships) can wait for days at anchor. Four docks are
identified (two new and two expansions) which would serve the region and which are beyond the scale of village

infrastructure. Modest storage facilities would be built at seven locations at a cost of under 1% of the project, but not
built where private initiatives are emerging. The docks and storage facilities are managed as a unit.
3. Project Benefits and Target Population:
Target Population:
The target population is approximately 520,000 people (25% of the province) located in 15 rural sub-districts
(kecamatans) in three districts--Maluku Utara, Halmahera Tengah and Maluku Tengah--which cover the islands of
Halmahera, Buru and Seram. The sub-districts were selected on the basis of poverty incidence, other project and
investment coverage, population density, accessibility and development potential. The target area contains just under
100,000 households in 371 villages, of which 53% were classified as "poor" or "backward" versus 33% nationally in
1995. Under the newer classification, all target villages are classified as poor (IDT). Between 70% and 75% of the target
population live in coastal farming/fishing villages with an estimated net farm income of $ 230 (using Rp. 5,000/$) which
is about half derived from copra extracted primarily from local varieties of coconuts. Copra accounts for up to 60% of
total cash income. For coastal villages, about a quarter of total cash and subsistence income comes from fisheries and
marine products. An estimated 15% - 20% of the population in the project area are transmigrants, mostly from Java,
growing paddy and secondary field crops. Many of these villages are awaiting irrigation infrastructure. They are located
on the plains and on short water courses in northwest Seram, around Wasile Bay in the northeast peninsula of Halmahera
and in eastern Buru. The remaining population, 10% - 15%, depend on a s]hifting, upland, traditional agricultural system.
Project Benefits:
1. About 50,000 households would be substantially and directly benefited during project implementation from
elevated household income by increased agriculture productivity, reduced losses due to pests, disease and storage, and
improved agriculture processing and market access. The indirect beneficiaries affected through revolving credit,
demonstration plots and technology diffusion during and after implementation are estimated to comprise another 25,000
households. Fishing households would benefit from stock assessment, processing, and storage improvements and basic
management plans. Of the beneficiaries, about 15,000 households will be reached by the first round of tree crops
rehabilitation and development. Farmer and fishing groups and small businesses in approximately 220 villages (about
60%) would receive first round loans from grants to villages for income generation proposals.
2. Residents in about 60% of target area villages would benefit from village infrastructure directed to water
supply, sanitation facilities, small jetties, sea walls, village drainage, bridges, culverts, farm access roads, electricity
generation and small scale irrigation improvement (village-based irrigation under 50 hectares).
3. About 15,000 households in transmigration areas would benefit from seed multiplication for irrigated
agriculture and creation. A number of farmers would be contracted as seed growers.
4. Consumers and producers of traded commodities would benefit from larger-scale sea transportation and
storage facilities at nine key sites.
4. Institutional and Implementation Arrangements:
Implementation Period: The project would be implemented over six years from July 15, 1998, to December 31,
2004, covering GOI's financial years 1998/99 through 2004/05.
Implementing Agencies and Project Coordination: Implementation would rely in the existing govermment
structure but with emphasis on decentralized management and village planning and participation. This project includes
both activities managed by line-agencies and financing and support for decentralized and village-based development.
National Level: At the national level a Central Guidance Committee would be established to provide direction
on policy and program issues relating to the project; review the progress of work on an annual basis; and make decisions
relating to overall loan administration and allocation of counterpart budgel:s. The membership of the Central Guidance

Country: INDONESIA                        Project Title: MALUKU REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Committee would include: the Biro Regional II, Deputy V of BAPPENAS; Agriculture Bureau, Deputy II of
BAPPE]NAS; the Direktorat Pembinaan dan Pembangunan Wilayah in the Directorate General Regional Development;
the Head of CASER within the Agency for Agricultural Research; the Director for Rehabilitation and Expansion of Area
of the Directorate General Estate Crops of the Ministry of Agriculture; the Directorate General of Agricultural and
Forestiy Products in the Department of Industry and Trade; the Directorate General Sea Communication within the
Department of Communications; and the Directorate General of Budget in the Ministry of Finance. The Directorate for
Area Development in the Directorate General of Regional Development would serve as the Secretariat for MRDP at the
national level.
BANGDA and BAPPEDA Tk. I would issue General Guidelines for Project Implementation (Juklak) which
would be furnished to the Bank for review. A Pimpro would be appointed to direct the operations of the Central
Guidance Committee and would assist with preparing annual guidelines on implementation, arranging and supporting
periodic reviews of implementation, and processing disbursement requests for activities carried out by the local
government authorities.
Provincial Level: At the provincial level a Provincial Project Coordination Committee (PPCC) has been
established by an SK from the Governor of the Province. This Committee would be responsible for coordination,
planning, monitoring and evaluation of project activities. The Head of the Provincial Development Planning Agency
(BAPPEDA Tk I) would be chairman of the PPCC and a Secretariat would be established within the Economics Division
of this agency. The membership of the PPCC would include: the Heads of Dinas for Estate Crops, Food Crops,
Livestock, Fisheries, Health, Industry, Bangdes, the Pimpros for the sectoral components for tree crops, industry and sea
communications and the Head of the Ambon AIAT. Representatives of local NGOs would also be represented in the
committee and invited to participate in regular coordination meetings.
District Level: In each of the three Kabupatens targeted under the project the Bupati would annually issue an
S.K. to formally establish a Kabupaten Coordinating Committee (Tim Koordinasi Kabupaten: TKK). The membership
of the TKK would include: the Heads of the Dinas Tk II for Estate Crops, Food Crops, Livestock, Fisheries, Health,
Industry, and PMD. Representatives of local NGOs would also be invited to participate in the activities of this
committee.
Sub-District Level: In each of the 15 kecamatans where MRDP activities are to be implemented a Kecamatan
Coordinating Committee would be appointed under the leadership of the Camat. Membership of the TKK would also
include: Kasi PMD, PPLs (extension workers), head of the PMU or sub-PMU for tree crops, community development
engineers and facilitators, and staff of the Camat. The TKK would coordinate, monitor and assist in the evaluation of the
field activities of the proposed project and provide technical and planning support to the project activities for village
initiatives. In each of the villages where MRDP activities are to be implemented a working group would be formed to
facilitate implementation of activities. This working group would be comprised of the Kepala Desa and LKMD
members, agricultural extension workers and representatives of community based organizations.
Implementation by Component:
Tree Crops Development and Rehabilitation: Implementation would follow a deconcentrated version of the approach
used in the Tree Crops Smallholder Development Project (scheduled for completion in September, 1998) and use some
of its facilities and staff and well as from another tree crops project (PRPTE). Implementation would be by the DG
Estate Crops of the Ministry of Agriculture. A Project Management Office (PMO) would be established in Ambon and
Project Management Units (PMUs) would be located in selected kecamatans, expanding the coverage of those now in
Jailolo, Tobelo, and Piru; upgrading the PMUs in Wahai and Maba; and creating new sub-PMUs in Kao, Morotai
Seletan, Oba and Wasile. Regional management, with central government budget support (APBN), would feature a
project officer (PIMPRO) at the provincial level in Ambon rather than in Jakarta. Extension agents from the PMUs and
sub-units would assist farmers, collect loan funds for this component, and advise village councils (LKMDs) in a new
credit system whereby loan repayment is to a village account rather than to a central government agency. The account

coutriy: INDONESIA                      Project Title: MALUKU REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
would be maintained by the local branch of Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BRI). Guidelines for Implementation of Tree Crop
Development and Rehabilitation would be prepared and agreed with the Bank as a condition of disbursement.
Community Development: The implementing agency would be BAPPEDA Tk. II at the kabupaten level and the Camat
and the UDKP at the kecamatan level. LKMDs assisted by Local Community Organizers would oversee implementation
at the village level. Grants to villages would be channeled through each kecamatan for infrastructure and village
enterprises/income generation. Proposals developed within the villages would be competitively selected within each of
the 15 kecamatan based in part on Village Action Plans. Two Community Facilitators from the kecamatan would assist
the LKMDs with proposal formulation and costing. For infrastructure development: Kecamatans would receive Rp. 100
million per proposal to be selected. Kecamatans would be phased in two groups and larger kecamatans would have
financing for three or four grants at the maximum level after the start-up period, depending on kecamatan size. (More
proposals could be selected and financed if some were less than the maximum.). There would be positive lists of
recommended infrastructure and negative lists of excluded infrastructure. Selection criteria would be established for the
kecamatans to apply to village proposals. Community financing of 10% to 20% would be expected. Grants could be used
to hire local labor for construction at a discount to market rates. For village enterprises and income generation: The
maximum award would be Rp. 50 million. There would be similar phasing of kecamatans and coverage (see Annex 2 for
details). Villages would on-lend to groups or organizations at market rates for repayment to a village account at the
kecamatan branch of BRI. Proposals would be developed with Facilitators, Local Community Organizers, NGOs, village
organizers and extension agents. For some agro-processing, proposals would be developed in conjunction with Tk II.
staff of Dinas Perindustrian who would be running demonstration processing activities. The most successful villages and
groups would be eligible for a second grant for infrastructure or credit for income generation. Guidelines for
Implementation of Village Grants would be prepared and agreed with the EBank as a condition of disbursement.
Support Services for Agriculture and Fisheries: For marketing and processing, the Pimpros would be appointed within
the Dinas Perindustrian in the targeted kabupatens. They would oversee prototype agro-processing activities with farmer
groups, fisher groups and small businesses. The Centers for Agricultural Information and Extension (BIPPs) and
existing extension workers would assist with for pest and disease control (cacao pod moths; coconut beetles, crown rot),
intercropping, and use of crop by-products. Three district-level Centers for Agricultural Information and Extension
(Balai Informasi dan Penuyuluhan Pertainian--BIPP) would be established in Masohi, Temate and Soa Siu. Small
Animal Health Clinics (POSKESWAN) would also be established which would be an asset of the kabupaten with the
Dinas Tk. II Livestock as executing agency. Seed multiplication for irrigated agriculture would be under the Dinas
Tanaman Tangan Tk I. Under a provincial Pimpro, each targeted kabupaten would have a Pimpro who would oversee
seed multiplication centers (BBU) and train the farmers to be contracted for production of extension seed. Fisheries
resource profiles and construction of facilities would be undertaken through Bappeda Tk. I and Dinas Perikanan.
Sea Transportation and On-Shore Facilities: The Provincial Office of the Department of Transportation (Kanwil
Perhubungan) would be implement the component and a Pimpro would be appointed. Two new docks match a relocation
of local government; two other docks would be extended. Drawings and designs are available.
Capacity Building for Project Management, Coordination, Monitoring and Evaluation: Implementation arrangements
are described above at the national provincial and district levels. Assistance would be primarily directed to the provincial
and district planning agencies (BAPPEDA Tk. I and II) in Ambon and the kabupaten headquarters in Temate, Soa Siu,
and Masohi, as well as the 15 kecamatans (sub-districts). Assistance woulcl be provided for kecamatan mapping through
BPN to improve spatial planning.
Project Oversight: Oversight would be provided by the Central Guidance Committee chaired by BAPPENAS.
Accounting. Financial Reporting. and Auditing: Each project implementing agency would establish and
maintain comprehensive, separate accounts from the beginning of implernentation to monitor use of funds under the
project. The DG of Budget of the Ministry of Finance in cooperation with the Bank would establish a Special Account
(SA) at Bank Indonesia for the project. An amount of $ 1.3 million wouldl be deposited therein to cover disbursements
over approximately a four month period. Replenishment would be monthly or when a draw down exceeds 20% of the

ceiling, whichever occurs first. A summary of SA activities would be provided to the Bank with the annual audited
financial statements of the project. Each executing agency would compile separate financial records. At the village
level, bank statements and accounts would be kept of village grants and revolving funds cross-checked with BRL. The
BAPPEDA in each kabupaten with the assistance of a project-financed accountant (three total) would submit financial
statements to the Provincial BAPPEDA, for compiling and adding line agency expenditures. BAPPEDA Tk. I would
prepare the consolidated financial reports. These would be passed to BANGDA at the central level and transmitted to the
Bank on a quarterly basis. All project accounts including SOEs but excluding the Special Account would be audited
annually by the Central Audit Bureau (BPKP). The audit of financial statements would: (1) assess the adequacy of
accounting and internal control systems; (2) determine whether expenditure documentation is adequate; and (3) verify
that expenditures submitted to the Bank are eligible for financing and identify those that are not. The Special Account
audit report would be provided by the DG Budget, MOF. All audit reports would be submitted to the Bank within nine
months of the close of each GOI fiscal year. Annex 7 contains an assessment of the procedures and controls needed to
produce accurate and timely project statements, staffing and qualifications requirements, the capacity to analyze project
statements in comparison with budgeted amounts and an assessment of audit arrangements. It also contains a Terms of
Reference for the audits of the Project Account, Special Account and the Statement of Expenditures.
Block B: Project Rationale
5. CAS objective(s) supported by the project:   Document number and date of latest CAS: 16691- IND
June 13, 1997
The CAS objectives are macroeconomic sustainability, increasing productivity and efficiency, and supporting
equitable and sustainable development. Equitable and sustainable development would be achieved through:
. Regional Development.
Project Response.
This project is directed to regional development in rural areas of Maluku, based on decentralized
planning and implementation. Most investments will be on Seram which is a strategic and priority growth
area for Indonesia, and Halmahera. The eastern Indonesian islands are a priority for growth and regional
balance.
* Poverty Reduction and Increased Equality.
Project Response:
Rural and agricultural development in poorer areas will help address poverty and inequality. The poverty
incidence based on household income is at least 50% higher in these areas of Maluku than nationally. Recent
data show national poverty to have dropped to around 11% measured purely by the adequacy of income to
secure a minimal diet. (In older data, nearly 29% of Maluku's population were below the poverty line
(adjusted head count index) versus 19.6% for Indonesia and the poverty rate in the project target area is
relatively higher than for Maluku). The incidence of "poor" villages in the target area is 20% higher than for
rural Indonesia as a whole (53% versus 33%), but this measure is heavily weighted by the availability of
infrastructure.
.  Sustainable Management of Natural Resources and the Environment.
Project Response:
Rehabilitation of aging coconut groves with under-story crops and replanting would increase intensification and
productivity without overly-supporting expansion;
Investment in fisheries assessment, management and processing, but not exploitation or increasedfishing
effort, would improve sustainability;
The project is designed in conjunction with Maluku Conservation and Natural Resources Management Project
to factor in the spatial impact of development against the backdrop of a conservation strategy.

6. Main Sector Issues and Government Strategy:
The Government's development strategy for Eastern Indonesia, embodied in the REPELITA VI plan, emphasizes:
* agricultural development including improved productivity, irrigation development, and enhanced services;
* infrastructure development including inter-island transport;
* human resource development;
* industrial development, with agro-processing being highlighted;
* deconcentration and decentralization of planning, administration, and implementation.
The above strategy is intended to advance the objectives of regional equity, a more spatially-balanced growth
pattern, improved rural/urban linkages, and strengthened national unity. The project accords will with this approach
through supporting productivity growth, processing, local initiatives, decentralization and inter-island transport. Sector
issues are set out below; the project's approach is summarized in the following section.
Regional Development and Decentralization. Conceptually, regional development appeals to the objectives of
rebalancing growth between Java and remote areas, targeting growth centers, packaging complementary interventions
and decentralizing the development mechanism. In practice, regional development can suffer from too many objectives,
over complexity of design, budgeting and implementation, and lack of critical mass. Extreme decentralization may
require implementation by less experienced agencies; yet excessive dependence on central government line agencies can
undermine local capacity-building and initiative, and may carry high over-heads. Centrally-planned strategies may not
fit the diversity of constraints and potentials in remote areas.
Credit Availability. Lack of credit availability is a recognized limitation to rural income growth. In the project's
target villages--some of which are coastal and roadless--there is virtually no commercial bank presence. Banks have
resisted lending to farmers and fisherman due to high transaction costs and administration, high credit risk, the absence
of collateral, and the small loan size. Only 1.5% of all bank loans in Maluku are for small scale agricultural credits (less
than Rp. 20 million). Rural credit projects (GTZ-assisted P4K and the IFAD-supported P4K projects) show that
successfully repayment rates are achievable, but these schemes also avoid agricultural lending.
Tree Crops Financing and Technology Diffusion. Financing of tree crops can be difficult due to the delay in
production and the inability to service debt for high-cost packages over a number of years. Longer-term financing carries
greater default risk and is even less available from the commercial sector than general agricultural financing. A Rural
Sector Board seminar (September 18th, 1997) concluded that no Bank project had been successful in the tree crop sector
without a direct or indirect subsidy; and that providing the first year or years of required inputs as grants is the preferred
option and superior to subsidized credit. This approach has been used in Bank tree-crops projects in Indonesia. The cost
of inputs and the production package can limit technology diffusion at project closure, especially if this implies the
cessation of credit and heavily subsidized inputs. This project relies on granits for one year of low-cost inputs for one-
half hectare followed by two years of loans.
Income Enhancement for Fishing Communities. Throughout the world, governments have subsidized fishing
gear and technologies which exploit an open access resource. Over-exploitation and sharply declining returns on
investment and effort have been the predictable results. The donor agencies have stood together in declining to finance
increases in fishing gear which contain any subsidy element. The full risk of the enterprise must be borne by the private
sector in order to reduce over-exploitation. Even revolving credit at markeit rates carries the risk of high default rates
without creditor recourse and would constitute an indirect subsidy. Malukcu exports about $ 150 million or marine
products and this resource is viewed as a major contributor to regional growth. The challenge is to increase returns to
fisheries without encouraging over-exploitation.
Village Infrastructure Financing and Community Participation. There is a growing body of evidence that
selected types of village infrastructure can be successfully and cost-effectively financed with directed grants if there are



Project Appraisal Document                                                                 Page 9
Country: IN9DONESIA                        Project Title: MALUKU REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
sufficient guarantees of village planning, participation and ownership coupled with appropriate guidance and oversight.
Experience is being gathered from the Government's IDT program, the Bank's Village Infrastructure Projects, and the
regional development projects.  Issues are the size of financing; selection of village projects; degree of village
contribution; oversight and technical assistance; the funds channeling mechanism and operation and maintenance. There
is no question that community participation in planning, design, and execution of either infrastructure or income-
generation activities is essential to their success. But without the appropriate level of outside guidance, there may be
defects in the technical or economic feasibility of the initiatives. The challenge is to maximize village input, and the
flow-through of benefits to the local level, without cutting back so severely on administration, oversight, village-level
support and guidance, that flawed and unworkable proposals are funded.
7. Sector Issues Addressed by the Project and Strategic Choices:
Regional Development and Decentralization. The project contains both regional, central agency supported
development, and community-based decentralized components. In this regard it is not as reliant on completely
decentralized, local government implementation which has strained capacity in some projects. Sea transportation and on-
shore facilities are regional in focus, implemented by a line agency, and are not village-based. Tree crops development
uses a "deconcentrated" model having provincial management and central government support. It is based on a
modification of the successful Tree Crops Smallholder Development Project (TCSDP). The village grants component is
highly participatory and decentralized and will finance proposals through a competitive process with selection at the sub-
district level. This structure provides balance between central agencies and local govemment. Budgetary complexity has
been simplified through use of a single INPRES (PPW for regional development) and central government funding
(APBN) rather than multiple Inpres accounts.
Credit Availability. Credits for income generation and village enterprises which are repaid into a village account
at market rates are intended to relieve the credit constraint. In addition, repayment of annual loans for tree crops will be
made to a village account and will add to credit availability.
Tree Crops Financing and Diffusion. This project will support hybrid and local tall varieties of coconut selected
from better performing stock, with coffee, fruit trees and food and forage crops. The emphasis on creation of village
nurseries for local tall coconuts and lower reliance on outside inputs is suited to remote areas and will assist replication
and sustainability at the closure of the project. The product would provide grants for the first year of inputs for coconuts
and food or forage crops and two years of loans for inputs for coconuts and coffee or fruit trees. This package would be
for up to 0.5 hectares per farmer. There would be seven years of grace period for coffee and local tall coconuts before
repayment begins, and four years for hybrid coconuts. This matches the beginning of repayment to the beginning of
production. In all cases, repayment would be over three years at market rates. Loan repayment, however, unlike in
TCSD1:, would be to a village account and made available on a rotational basis, rather than to the central agency. Loan
repayment is also faster under MRDP than TCSDP.
Income Enhancement for Fishing Communities. The project will not finance boats, nets, motors, other gear, or
equipment to increase fishing effort. It would finance value added investment in post-harvest processing, such as fish
drying, smoking, fish meal production; construction of superior cold boxes for transportation and to improve quality;
collection boats; deep water fish aggregation devices (FADs) for pelagic species (mostly tuna); fish cage culture; and sea
weed collection and production.
Village Infrastructure Financing and Community Participation. Strategic choices are: (1) Not all villages would
receive a fixed grant for infrastructure, but the amount would match the specific proposal. (2) Selection of proposals at
the sub-district (kecamatan) level will help avoid an entitlement mentality and should improve commitment and
ownership. This contrasts with approaches which pre-select villages on existing criteria. (3) There would be assistance
with proposals and implementation by kecamatan level engineers.

8. Project Alternatives and Reasons for Rejection:
Geographic Focus on North and Central Maluku. The geographic targeting is sensitive to population density
(still very low and averaging about 20 persons/km2 in the target area), potential markets and transportation, growth
momentum, development potential, land use classification, complementary development initiatives and other factors.
The proposed Maluku Conservation and Natural Resources Project will include some sites in these areas and the fourth
kabupaten: Maluku Tenggara.
Simplification of Design. The project design has been simplified by geographic targeting and by eliminating the
financing of the following for various reasons:
* cacao production;
* farming systems development and research (only technology diffusion is financed);
* rotational livestock distribution and credit in-kind;
* revolving credit for annual crops;
* fishing boats and gear; cold storage or ice production for fisheries;
* water user's associations for irrigated agriculture;
* small, semi-technical irrigation (schemes of a few hundred to a few thousand hectares);
Cacao Limited to Pest Control. The area planted to cacao (chocolate) has expanded faster than any other crop in
Maluku over the last 15 years, averaging an 11% compounded growth rate. About 75% of the area is classified as recent
planting. Trade and marketing are competitive and unhindered by restrictive regulation, hence marketing margins are
low and farm gate prices relatively high. The economics are competitive wi:th coffee at normal yields and cacao is often
interplanted with coconuts. However, Maluku, in common with many other areas, is afflicted with cacao pod borer moth
which is difficult and expensive to control, especially for small-holders. Once found mostly on Halmahera, the pod borer
is now encountered widely on Seram. Control measures include expensive chemical spraying, wrapping the fruit in
plastic (and unwrapping to control fungus), insect control and carefully-timed harvesting and pruning.  Some
recommendations are simply to cut the cacao trees down. A large cacao plantation on northeast Seram reported losses of
40% in 1996 and 30% in 1997 due to the borer despite frequent spraying and harvesting. In the target area farming
systems, a yield decrease of one-third implied that ERRs are 6 % lower with cacao intercropping than without. The
project would not support cacao planting because of the pod borer risk, but would finance pod borer control. This was
among the problems most frequently cited by farmer groups. This decision to exclude new cacao planting from the
project could be revisited if there is solid evidence that the pest no longer poses a significant risk to viability.
Farming Systems Development: Research versus Diffusion. It was decided that agricultural research was
adequately funded under the Bank-financed Agricultural Research Management II project. Reliance on new systems
development causes delayed adoption and diffusion during the project lifetime. Rather than develop multiple new
systems, and finance demonstrations, the project would replicate a low cost, tested package of well-selected, traditional
coconuts, coffee, and food crops. This accelerates implementation and lowers project risks and uncertainty. Agro and
marine produce processing constitutes a second area of technology diffusion.
Cattle/Buffalo Not Financed. "Cattle under coconut" is a common recommendation for coastal farming systems
and credit for cattle was cited as a farmer priority. However, The IFAD-supported Eastern Islands Smallholder Farming
Systems and Livestock Development Project began in Maluku and Sulawesi in 1996/97. This project will distribute
15,840 head of Bali cattle and 5,060 head of goats on a credit basis in 23 sub-districts of Maluku Tengah and Maluku
Utara. This will cover seven of the 15 kecamatans targeted by this project. Earlier projects have reached a number of
villages with cattle components on northern Seram. These activities are viewed as complementing the strategy proposed
here. It is recommended not to add a livestock component to this project, but to emphasize animal health services in
areas not reached by the IFAD-assisted project. (This Farming Systems and Livestock Project will renovate three animal
health clinics.)   Eliminating rotational livestock distribution greatly simplifies procurement, logistics, and
implementation compared to some other projects. Livestock could be purchases with loans from village grants.

Country: INDONESIA                          Project Title: MALUKU REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Rotational Credit for Annual Crops. Annual crops are not financed over long periods with rotational annual
credit. This avoids the risk to sustainability which arises from crop failure or drought which can induce default and stop
the cycle of repayment. This dependency jeopardizes future planting and technology diffusion, especially in dry areas
encountered in other provinces. During the first year of tree crop establishment, there would be financing of food or
forage crops as an income boost prior to tree crop production. After the grant for inputs for the first year, loans for tree
crops fcr years two and three would be made. Repayment of these loans to the village could be used for further adoption,
but can be used for other purposes. Sustainability is enhanced by the low cost of inputs, the nature of tree crops, and
village nurseries for traditional coconut varieties (access to shipped hybrid seedlings is not required). Long-term
financing of annual crops is avoided.
Cold Storage: Ice Production: Fishing Boats and Gear. Cold storage and ice production would be left to the
private sector. Due to reasons cited above under sector issues, the project would not finance fishing boats, motors or
fishing gear. Grants to villages could be made for on-lending to fishing groups with solid proposals for processing,
transpoirtation of fish and marine products, fish aggregation devices in deep water, and limited acquaculture (sea weed
and fish cage culture).  The project would finance fisheries resource profiles. It would also finance studies into the
possible need for "sites and services" to provide public infrastructure to attract private investment. No investment in
public fisheries infrastructure (beyond that supported through the village infrastructure component) would be financed
except as recommended by this study and agreed to by the Bank.
Semi-Technical Irrigation and Water User's Associations. Despite attractive rates of return on investment in
irrigation schemes in the 700 - 3,000 hectare range, for which there is potential in Maluku, a decision was taken not to
finance development in even the older transmigration areas in Maluku. This decision was based on: sparse population in
some sites; the Bank's policy of not supporting recent transmigration; other donor assistance to some of the older
transmigration areas which would be eligible for Bank assistance; uncertain hydrology in some cases; and priority being
given to the traditional population groups. Water User's Associations were also dropped from the project design to
reduce complexity and focus on higher priorities. However, the project would finance seed multiplication for irrigated
crops which is a necessary complement to the investment from outside this project in irrigation infrastructure.

10. Lessons Learned and Reflected in Project Design:
The closed regional projects cited above (Upland Area Development and Nusa Tenggara Agricultural
Support) were rated as satisfactory overall, likely to be sustainable, and as contributing to institutional development.
Evaluations highlighted the importance of a flexible design, the value of block financial allocations when accompanied
by appropriate guidelines, and the benefits of community participation. The projects demonstrated the importance of
removing infrastructure bottlenecks, timely budget allocations and early delivery of inputs. Lessons included the need
for access to credit (and the utility of initial subsidization of new inputs in selected circumstances), political commitment
to rural development and capable, inter-agency coordination. Three recommendations from projects outside Indonesia
are: avoid overly-complex designs; resist establishing specialized, new administrative structures; and avoid the diffiusion
of implementation responsibility. OED's study of area development projects (September, 1993) reiterated these themes
and stressed the importance of a bottom-up, community process approach.
The Nusa Tenggara Agricultural Area Development Project (NTAADP), now in the early stages of
implementation, has suffered from delayed release of funds for planting material, relatively high mortality rates for
livestock, a challenging geographic scope and heavy reliance on local implementation capacity. Late release of funds
contributed to late planting and a higher failure rate for tree seedlings, and to less than inspiring results on technology
demonstration plots. The project was recently reviewed by the Quality Assurance Group (QAG Review of East Asia
Poverty Reduction Projects, October 20, 1997) and found to be marginally satisfactory. Among other lessons, the review
highlighted over-reliance on local government, complexity, and the risks of revolving credit to finance dryland, annual
crops. Concerns were raised over the distribution of benefits within villages: subsidies reaching prosperous farmers.
The Tree Crops Smallholder Development Project illustrates the importance of quality planting material, support
for nurseries, the value of perennial undercrops, and farmers' capacity for debt servicing. Land security is provided by
land titling at the outset which is held in trust as incentive to both invest and repay loans for inputs. However, due to
concerns regarding communally-held land in some project areas in MRDP, this project will not finance land titling.
Under TSCDP, inputs in the first year on a grant basis combined with loans at market rates in subsequent years provides
sufficient cost recovery without over-burdening beneficiaries. At mid-term review this project was estimated to have an
ERR of 20% and is progressing well. Target areas were expanded. The Tree Crops Project contained sites in Maluku
and is important for the proposed project due to the dominance of coconuts in central and northern areas. Hybrids were
more successful in Maluku than any other province, but for reasons cited above, this project will offer both hybrid and
local tall varieties of coconuts.
The Water Supply and Sanitation for Low Income Communities Project is targeted to reach 115 villages in
Maluku and has generally been successful in delivering village-suppoited water and sanitation.  The Village
Infrastructure Development Projects have also provided grants to villages ifor small-scale infrastructure with villages
providing some labor and materiel. A refined design is being proposed for the Kecamatan Development Fund Project
whereby village proposals would be selected to provide some competition and ensure greater ownership, rather than
simply preselecting villages on poverty and other criteria. This kecamatan-based approach would be used in MRDP.
The Bank has supported GOI's policy of increased agriculture research through the Second Agriculture Research
Management Project (ARM H, Ln. 3886-IND, 1995) geared to agro-ecological zones. MRDP will build on ARM II, not
by financing additional research, but by focusing on technology diffusion for coffee cultivation, selection of traditional
coconut varieties, establishment of village nurseries, control of cacao borer an,d processing.
There are significant differences between the design of several of the cited projects and the Maluku Regional
Development Project. A few comparisons are summarized below. It should be noted that the Nusa Tenggara projects are
operating in a very dry climate, and are linking research and demonstration plots for a variety of farming systems to
adoption incentives. The timing of inputs a critical factor. MRDP is not operating in an arid climate, would not be
researching new farming systems and would not attempt to fundamentally alter farmer behavior.

11. Indicators of Borrower Commitment and Ownership:
Background:
The President's Budget Speech of 1990 conferred special attention to the development of Eastern Indonesia. The
Second Long Term Development Plan (PJPT II) underscored the importance of regional growth for equity and national
unity. The five-year development plan for 1994/95-1998/99 (REPELITA VI) targeted much higher development
expenditure and growth rates for Eastern Indonesia. The strategy emphasized productivity gains in agriculture,
agribusiness, physical infrastructure, agricultural processing, and integrated area development interventions. The annual
development budgets for the Eastern Provinces (APBD) then tripled during the 1990s. A Council for Development of
Eastern Indonesia, established by Presidential Decree, and its respective Commissions, selected two areas in Maluku for
targeted public and private investment due to high growth potential. These areas, Ambon/Seram and Maluku Utara, are
targeted by this project.
Project Specific:
Preparation was undertaken in the provincial BAPPEDA office with input and workshops involving three levels
of government. By decree of the Governor, a project task force (pokja) was established with appropriate agency
representation. Near the end of preparation, detailed counterpart budgets were planned for each kabupaten which
allocated 16% of project costs from the central government including the "on-top" funding; 2% from the provincial
(APBD Tk. I) level and 2% from district level resources. These budgets were prepared in anticipation of project launch
to avoid start-up delays.
12. Value Added of Bank Support:
The Bank is well-positioned to assist Government in achieving its objectives for development in Maluku given
the Bank's involvement in agriculture-based regional development in Eastern Indonesia (one project closed and two
under implementation), and Sumatra (one appraised and two under prepaLration). There are linkages between the
proposed project and the Bank-supported decentralized agriculture research and tree crops smallholder projects. In
addition, the Bank is pioneering community-based needs assessment and participation which are incorporated into
MRDP. The Village Infrastructure Projects have demonstrated the viability Df community-led infrastructure initiatives.
The Bank is helping develop a kecamatan selection process for village proposals, as an expansion of the original concept,
which is also being piloted in this project. Finally, the proposed project has been prepared in conjunction with a Maluku
Conservation and Natural Resources Management Project which has facilitated design complementarities.
Block C: Summary Project Assessments. (Detailed assessments are in Project File. See Annexes 4 and 8.)
13. Economic Assessment           X Cost -Benefit Analysis   Q Cost Effectiveness Analysis  Q Other (specify)
Half of the project costs produce quantifiable benefits with an Economic Rate of Return (ERR) equal to 34.5%
and a Net Present Value of $ 17.4 million discounted at 10% and based on Rp. 4,000/$. Sensitivity analysis shows higher
returns with a weaker rupiah due to higher returns to labor in the production of tradable commodities. World prices of
tradable inputs and outputs are unaffected by the weaker currency, but labor costs are translated to a lower dollar
equivalent due to the devaluation. The ERR increases by nearly 9% using Rp. 5,000/$ and the Net Present Value rises to
$ 22.7 million. This analysis covers components for Tree Crops, Processing and Marketing, Agricultural Extension, Seed
Multiplication, Sea Transportation, and half the costs for Capacity Building, Project Management and Monitoring and
Evaluation. Components not included in the economic analysis are Village Grants, Animal Health Services, Fisheries
Support, and the other half of Capacity Building and Project Management costs. A 20% rise in total costs or a drop in
benefits of 20% lowers the ERR by 7% and 10% respectively. If the costs of all components producing benefits which
are not directly quantified are loaded on the analysis against measured benefits, the project return drops to about 24%.
Further details of economic and sensitivity analysis are presented in Annex 4.

14. Financial Assessment
The Central Government would be channeling counterpart funds for the project equal to $4.2 million over six
years. T he financial impact for GOI is relatively small and has largely been programmed already for the first year. At
the household level, financial assessments were conducted for farm models using the base case cropping pattern of
traditional coconuts and coffee, intercropped with food crops for three years. This system raised farm income by 49%
after full production in the low input case. With higher inputs, this model elevated farm income by 61%. Returns are
resilient to low levels of inputs, sustainable over long periods, and can be replicated through low levels of household
investment: adoption of a 0.5 hectare package requires a total investment of under $180 over the three year period.
15. Technical Assessment (See Annex 4 for further details.)
Tree crop development under the base case for expansion assumes:
* virtually no purchased inputs for half the adopters of local tall coconuts; moderate fertilizer
for half of the total tall coconut farmers and all the hybrid adopters after farming system year three
(year four of the project); three years of fertilizer application for coconut and one year for coffee
would be financed in the project.
* 120 coconut palms/hectare; 460 (robusta) coffee trees/hectare (4m x 4m grid); 0.5 hectares of
paddy or groundnut;
* three years of food crop production (1.8 tons/hectare for paddy and 800 kg/hectare for groundnuts);
but only one financed under the project;
* copra production begins in year six at 375 kg/hectare and rises to 1,125 kg/hectare in year ten under
low inputs; in the high inputs case, followed by one-third the adopters, yields reach 1,500 kg/hectare
in year 10; for hybrid coconut, copra yields reach 1,350 kg/hectare in the low input case and
2,000/hectare in the high input case;
* after planting in year three, coffee production begins in year six and yields reach 250 kg/hectare by
year 10 and levels out at 300 thereafter.
These are very conservative input and yield assumptions given that the average for the 12 targeted kecamatans
for this component has been around 1.5 tons/hectare for copra (based on productive local tall coconut palms) and 430
kg/hectare for coffee. The farm model ERR is 26% in the base case. High cost farming system packages and lack of
inputs have hampered the adoption and sustainability of farming systems in some other projects. Whereas some tree
crops system packages requireanmnual loans for purchased inputs of $400 to $ 500 per hectare for establishment, here
costs under the base case, also excluding labor, are $ 360 per hectare for the entire first three years. Moreover, the
project would provide inputs and financing for only about 0.5 hectares per household. These features allow the project to
reach many more households, lower the risks and enable poorer farmers to adopt. The less affluent farmers in particular
have been unable or unwilling to adopt higher cost packages in some areas, especially for unfamiliar cropping patterns
and comnmodities. The proposed cropping pattern and package has been reviewed with the PMO for TCSDP in Ambon,
the Dinas Perkebunan and area farmers. To provide flexibility, the project would also support inter-cropping of fruit
trees in place of coffee at the farmer's choice, coffee intensification (interplanted with existing coconut), coconut
intensification and rehabilitation. Choice of food crops and forage while tree crops are being established is also
permitted and financed.
Detailed financial feasibility studies for village based processing have been produced for copra oil (two-ton/day
mill), palm sugar, coconut log production (ten palms per day), and essential oil production (clove and nutmeg), including
rate-of-return calculations. Fish smoking and drying technologies are fairly straight-forward. The technical feasibility of
village infrastructure has been demonstrated in the VIP projects and in the Water Supply and Sanitation Project.
Sea transportation and shore facilities would follow set designs having dock or wharf extensions of about 50
meters (two cases) and a causeway and jetty in two cases. National standards would be followed for new wharves.
Storage facilities would be 200 m2. All sites have been identified and draft plans have been drawn.

16. Institutional Assessment
This project is less reliant on local implementation capacity than sorme of its immediate predecessors which may
have been too ambitious in terms of decentralization. It does, nevertheless, convey considerable responsibilities to
BAPPEDA and the kabupaten and kecamatan levels for aspects of project management. BAPPEDA and the Project Task
Force (Pokja) with representative Dinas agencies have worked well and intimately with the Preparation Team and are
knowledgeable about the project design and objectives, having, inter alla, just completed a counterpart budgeting
exercise for first year of implementation.
Tree Crops Development. The Tree Crops Smallholder Development Project closes in September, 1998. The
Project Management Officers and Units would be "recontracted" under MRDP through a letter of authorization.
Deconcentrated, regional management with central government budget support would give greater authority to local
project units and simplify coordination at the provincial and kabupaten levels compared with TCSDP. TCSDP developed
about 4,300 hectares of coconut in Maluku. The proposed area for MRDP is 7,500 hectares. Project Management Units
or Sub-Units have been operating in Tobelo, Galela, Oba, Jailolo, and Piru and would be utilized for MRDP. Additional
sub-units would be established in other kecamatans as listed in the Implementation Plan summary.
Animal Health Services and Extension. The animal health clinics (POSKESWAN) would be assets of the
kabupaten authorities and the sub-component would be implemented by the Dinas Tk. II Livestock. One veterinarian and
one technical school graduate per unit would staff the POSKESWAN under the technical supervision of the Veterinary
Laboratories in Ambon and Ternate. The project would also finance district Centers for Agricultural Information and
Extension (BIPPs) and upgrading of rural extension centers (BPPs) at the kecamatan level.  Construction and
rehabilitation of these facilities would be made conditional on satisfactory staffing and management plans.
Community Development. Village facilitators would be trained and based in target areas to provide assistance to
village leaders and community-based groups and organizations for planning end implementation of village development.
Project funding would flow directly to the LKMD (village council) in the target areas after selection and vetting by
kecamatan and kabupaten officials. Training of personnel from the LKMJDs and staff of the kecamatan level of
government would transfer basic knowledge in small-scale proposal development and management. It is expected that
experience gained will generate benefits in the use of local development funds (INPRES Desa). Although the existing
LKMD structure is weak, the project begins with a modest number of villages and has components which are not
dependent on the LKMD in order to reduce the administrative and managerial requirements at the village level. It should
be noted that funding will be for proposals submitted rather than pre-selecting villages which meet certain criteria. This
provides some self-selection in terms of capacity.
Sea Transportation and On-Shore Infrastructure. The Provincial Office of the Department of Transportation
(KanWil Perhubungan) routinely constructs this type of infrastructure. New infrastructure in remoter areas would be
turned over to the kabupaten governments for management. In cases where storage is built near existing docks, or where
docks are expanded, their ownership and operation would follow the existing arrangements.
17. Social Assessment
Summary: Social Assessment (SA), including a participatory evaluation of needs, was managed by the Bank and
conducted in the project target areas during the first months of preparation. The SA phase utilized local and foreign
consultants, with assistance from BANDGA and BAPPEDA, and administered a structured village questionnaire survey.
The survey covered local and transmigration communities and traditional groups and was directed to resource use
patterns, community needs, development objectives, constraints to developmlent, evaluation of institutions and service
delivery, availability of credit and agricultural practices. The survey collected data from 16 villages on Seram and 23
villages on Halmahera. In addition, the SA exercise conducted focus group discussions, resource mapping, and
stakeholder workshops. Findings from the SA were presented to the Governor and provincial and district agencies.

Country: INiDONESIA                        Project Title: MALUKU REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT PRO.JECT
Consultants participating in SA were retained during project preparation for continuity. Prioritized lists of desired village
infrastructure and agricultural problems were tabulated across villages and farmer groups. The leading infrastructure
needs were water supply, jetties, village drainage, small scale irrigation and bridges. Among the income-related
priorities were control of cacao moth, diversification of cash crops, control of Newcastle disease (chickens), scabies
eradication in goats, processing copra oil and other commodities (cassava chips and flour), coconut development,
fisheries diversification and fish drying, smoking and processing. The potential for intensification in the understory of
coconut groves and the need for rehabilitation were highlighted. There is also strong interest in credit for cattle, credit
for fishing boats and in road development. The IFAD project is judged to be meeting most of the demand for livestock.
MRDP cloes not provide cattle distribution or a rotational livestock scheme, but loans from village grants could be used
for livestock purchase. Fishing boats are excluded for policy reasons. Kabupaten road development is being handled in
other projects. Small-scale village improvements in bridges, culverts and feeder roads could be financed under village
grants component of MRDP.
Isolated, Vulnerable People and Ethnic Groups: Sixteen distinct ethnic groups were identified in the project
areas of Halmahera; of these, seven groups, the Galela, Tobelo, Boeng, Modole, Pagu, Tugutil and Maba, would meet the
World Bank's definition of "indigenous people" under OD4.20. Two of these groups are found in inland areas; the
Galela community surrounds the lake of the same name; and the other groups are in coastal areas only or are both coastal
and inland. Their economies all feature subsistence agriculture, tree crops, and/or fisheries. On Seram, the ethnic
composition reflects an influx of Bugis, Butonese, Javanese, and migrants from neighboring islands of Haruku, Saparua,
Ambon and the Lease Islands. Based on coastal dialects, about 17% of the population of Kecamatans Seram Utara and
Tehoru would be classified as "indigenous" under the Bank's definition, plus about 3.5% of the entire island's population
which is located in remote, interior areas. The project is primarily targeted to villages containing very traditional
communities and isolated, vulnerable people and the supported project interventions harmonize with the local economies
dominated by tree crops (mostly coconuts) and fisheries. These groups were included in project design workshops. The
grants and revolving credit components encourage village-based selection of activities, participation and implementation.
Only the seed multiplication subcomponent would more directly benefit transmigrants. Because of the overall design
and targeting of the project, no separate Indigenous Peoples' Action Plan was deemed to be necessary.
Transmigrant Communities: The main concentration of transmigrant communities is in the Tehoru area on south
Seram and in Seram Utara (north coast) east of Wahai. These communities were generally established 5 - 10 years in the
past, although some villages are only one or two years old. In these two locations, transmigrants were about 18% of the
population. Farmer priorities are irrigation development, inputs, clearing land (lahan II) and agricultural equipment.
Social Assessment noted that seed supply is problematic in terms of quality and availability. Farmers resorted to
multiple re-use of seed stock, resulting in reduced yields. MRDP would address this problem.
Women 's Issues: Social Assessment in the Halmahera area found increasing roles for women in food production,
processing and marketing. There has been a shift in some communities from dependence on sago for subsistence
consumption, to cassava for consumption and tree crops for cash income. Production of cassava flour and chips, and
coconut oil, are currently home-based but time are consuming and tiring. These compete with family demands and other
income/production responsibilities. Women are also engaged in fish drying for wage income and were found to have less
time available for subsistence gardens, wood gathering, and other household chores. Social Assessment in the Seram
area noted women's involvement in coconut processing and the high labor requirements for splitting coconuts, grating
them anid drying copra. Drying methods are traditional and dependent on weather. The quality of oil tends to be low and
the oil has a short shelf-life. Improved processing of various agricultural commodities, but particularly copra and
cassava, and reduced spoilage of fish, were identified areas which would benefit women and are included in the project.
Efforts through the Community Facilitators will be made to involve women in the choice and development of village
infrastructure proposals. For credits for income generation, a target of one-third of the proposals financed should come
from women's groups. To facilitate this objective, the list of suggested enterprises targeted to women's groups has been
expandied to include ceramics, weaving, fiber mats and coconut by-products, and other handicrafts. Activities targeted to
women are noted in Annex 2.

County: INDONESIA                          Project Title: MALUKU REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Local Community Credit: Demand for credit was high, particularly in the Seram area, from various groups:
women (for sewing, fish-drying, red sugar production, and agricultural processing); farmers (for agricultural equipment
and inputs); fisherman (equipment and transportation) and youth (for agri-business). Some communities in the
Halmahera area were more concerned about the risks and obligations of credit arrangements and may prefer credit
extended by traders. Home-based furniture production as well as coconut, clove, and kayu lawant oil processing were
cited as agri-business activities with community interest and which required credit.
Land Acquisition: The small land requirements for extension centers, animal health clinics, storage facilities,
docks, and fish landing sites (if developed) have mostly already been acquired by the government. In cases where land
was not already available, it would be freely donated by beneficiary communities or purchased by the Government from
willing sellers. With regard to sub-projects financed through grants for village infrastructure, land acquisition would be
kept to a minimum and no person would be physically displaced. Land or other assets would be acquired through
voluntary contributions or contribution against compensation according to Guidelines agreed at negotiations.
18. Environmental Assessment             Environmental category: E A.  X  B  E C
The project involves no resettlement and is expected to have no ma jor detrimental impacts on the environment.
Some local, small-scale impacts from village infrastructure may occur (sea walls, village roads) or sea transportation
facilities (dock improvement and storage). However, certain types of infrastructure would have positive environmental
effects. For example, storage facilities and dock improvements would improve the handling of construction material for
purposes outside the project. Rusting and cracked tar barrels for roads are now stacked in the open salt air on the dock at
Subaim on Wasile Bay and are leaking and contaminating the shore area. Village infrastructure for drainage and flood
control, as well as sea walls, would prevent or lessen erosion and sedimentat.ion. The Guidelines for the Implementation
of Village Grants must be acceptable to the Bank as a condition of disbursement and will include a checklist for
community facilitators and engineers to review the potential environmental impacts of the proposed infrastructure or
income generation activity with mitigation plans if required. All infrastructure projects would be screened following
GOI's Standard Operating Procedures for small-scale infrastructure activities.
There are other environmental benefits incorporated into the project design.  MRDP would encourage
intensification and replanting of aging, low yielding coconut stands through demonstration and support for coconut log
saw mills. This encourages replanting of less productive areas, reduces the tendency to clear new land, and supplies
some timber needs. Any new areas planted to coconuts would have to be grassland, brush or scrub forest where new
planting would have minimal negative impacts. No clearing of primary or secondary forest would be permitted under the
project and all land development would be in areas classified for agricultural production or conversion of degraded
forest. The total number of hectares planned for the tree crops component and their distribution across kecamatans was
designed with these conditions in mind and after analysis of the availabilily of scrub and grassland. Techniques for
controlling cacao pod borer would be promoted based on well-timed and fi^equent harvesting and pruning rather than
spraying. Fishery profiles may improve the sustainability of near-shore marine resources. There would be no financing
of increased fishing effort through boats, motors, or gear. Fish ponds (freshwater and brackish) have been dropped from
the project but fish cage culture is an option for the use of income-generation credits.
The project would be implemented over the same time period as the proposed Maluku Conservation and Natural
Resources Management Project (MACONAR). Social Assessment for both projects was jointly conducted. This project
would plan and establish a representative system of terrestrial and marine protected areas in Maluku; and implement a
management plan in a subset of these areas. It would develop conservation awareness and provide financing for
conservation initiatives in important habitats and eco-systems. It would also create an incentive framework for
conservation by rewarding positive protection of the environment. MACONAR would, inter alia, protect watersheds and
mangrove areas which are important for sustaining near-shore fisheries. Prctection of marine conservation areas could
also boost the productivity of fisheries. MRDP would emphasize processing of agricultural commodities which helps
shift the development pattern away from extensification. MRDP would contribute to conservation through mapping and
spatial planning. Mapping would identify physical features and habitats important to biodiversity such as fresh-water

swamps, mangrove areas, deltas and wet-lands, nesting beaches, beach forests, coral and sea grass areas. Some of these
sites would be the focus of the proposed MACONAR project. The kecamatan selection for MRDP was sensitive to the
target coDnservation sites proposed for MACONAR and to reducing development pressure and the possibility of
encroachment around Manusela National Part on Seram and the Lalobata-Ake Tajawi area of Halmahera.
19. Participatory Approach
The preparation team included specialists recommended by the provincial planning agency (BAPPEDA) and the
local university (Pattimura), several of whom were involved in social assessment. Workshops have been held with
NGOs, district government, and beneficiaries. After social assessment, there was further cross-checking of priorities
through surveys of sub-districts (15 kecamatans surveyed), villages, and farmer groups (16 surveyed) to refine project
design.. Significant consultation has occurred with implementing local agencies and sectoral agencies on design and
budgets.
For each Stakeholder Group below, the type of participation is identified as: information sharing (IS); consultation (CON); and
collaboration (COL).

Block D: Project Sustainability and Risks
20. Project Sustainability:
Tree crop development can generate long-term income once stands are established. A number of risks which can
impair sustainability are avoided by supporting either hybrid or local tall coconuts with coffee or fruit tree farning
system. These are:
* risks of disease in hybrid coconuts (top rot) in some areas can be avoided by planting local tall varieties; this
was not a feature of earlier projects;
* pod borer in cacao is avoided by financing coffee for new planting and pest control for cacao;
* village nurseries and training for local tall coconuts, based on carefully selected motherstock, improves
sustainability in those areas not adopting hybrids since reliance on outside inputs drops;
* lower cost of packages makes adoption more affordable;
* targeting 1/2 hectare per household reaches many more households and allows for expansion within
the farm holding;
* repayment to a village account rather than to the Ministry of Finance increases credit availability;
The sustainability of village infrastructure will depend on the selection of quality proposals, commitment at the
community level and operation and maintenance. The willingness of villages to contribute labor and material and
preparation in design are indications of commitment. Operation and maintenance plans are required with proposals.
The sustainability of revolving credit depends on repayment records, and the potential for further productive
investment. The GTZ project (Linking Banks to Self-Help Groups--a model of one form of credit provision) had a good
repayment record. There can be risks that loans to groups leave no one with a sense of individual responsibility,
however. Posting names of borrowers and identifying next generation beneficiaries improves repayment performance.
Sea transportation infrastructure and shore facilities have relatively low maintenance costs and generate long-
term benefits. No new agencies or institutions would be created under the project (except for some marketing support)
and recurrent costs were kept low. Requiring matching local funds contributes to institutional sustainability.

Country: INDONESIA                        Project Title: MALUKU REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
21. Critical Assumptions and Risks:
Assumption                Risk Rating            Risk Minimization Measure
Timely Budget Release and Input Delivery  Medium      This has been a problem in the Nusa Tenggara and
Sulawesi Agricultural Area Dev. Projects. In MRDP
first year budgets have already been agreed. Tree
crops will follow a sectoral approach and be less
dependent on outside supply of seedlings. Risks are
also lower because there is a less severe dry season:
late planting cloes not have the same risk of mortality.
A simplified an more unitary budget system based on
the Regional Development Inpres rather than a
number of specific Inpres budgets will help.
Agricultural Productivity Increases      Low          The expected yield increases are fairly secure given
agricultural conditions in Maluku. The project builds
on existing momentum and technology. Higher risk
crops with less disease resistance and more
dependence on imported inputs are avoided (hybrid
coconuts and cacao). No radical changes in behavior
or cropping pafttern is required.
Local Implementation Capacity           Medium       Local institutional capacity will require strengthening.
Decentralized projects place a new implementation
burden on agencies. BAPPEDA, the various Dinas
offices, and in particular the village LKMDs will need
guidance and support. Risks are reduced by: (I) some
components are delivered by central agencies; (2) less
reliance on complicated farming systems development
and diffusion; providing kecamatan and village
facilitators; modest geographic scope with only three
kabupatens; some NGO assistance with
implementation. Structured facilitators and
community organizers at the kabupaten, kecamatan
and village levels.
Village Infrastructure and Income Enterprises Medium  For infrastructare, there is a good track record if
are Sustainable                                       adequate village input and participation are assured.
The Village Infrastructure and Water Supply and
Sanitation Project designs would be used with some
modification. There are higher risks for income
generation: proposal feasibility; repayment of credit;
operation and maintenance. Although some agro-
processing activities are experimental, a feasible set
has been pre-appraised which matches village
preferences. Quality village facilitators are essential.

Country: INDONESIA                          Project Title: MALUKU REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
22. Possible Controversial Aspects:
1. Loans to farmers for tree crop development would be repaid to village accounts rather than to the Ministry of
Finance. This has been agreed and would be incorporated in the Guidelines for Credits and Revolving Funds.
2. Although subsidization of inputs is a common means of initial support for tree crops, it is sometimes argued
that this is undesirable since it may distort incentives to adopt a particular technology. Here it is proposed that a very low
level of grants for inputs (about $ 100 per household) be provided for the first year only. This is not viewed as
distortionary for coconuts given the small size of the grant element, the wide-spread cultivation particularly of local
varieties and the presence of earlier projects (SCDP and TCSDP) which have financed hybrid coconuts in some areas
with larger grant elements. Food crops would be financed by grants for inputs in year one. However, the project would
link coconuts with coffee or fruit trees and here the subsidization of inputs is intended to encourage coffee cultivation
and dampen the trend toward cacao which is very vulnerable to cacao pod borer. Moreover, the project encourages
replanting and intensification which have positive environmental effects.
3. Financing of fisheries related activities would be limited to processing, collection and transportation, cold
boxes, off-shore fish aggregation devices and limited acquaculture. It would not include boats, motors, nets, gear, or
other means to increase fishing effort. Provincial agencies have requested financing for boats, motors, and gear, but have
accepted the Bank's position.
Block E: Main Loan Conditions
Conditions of Board Presentation:
1. The provincial Project Coordination Committee has been established.
!_onditions of Disbursement:
1. Construction of BIPPs, POSKESWAN and BPP (civil works) would be contingent upon preparation of
management and staffing plans for these units.
:2. Disbursements for on-shore fisheries facilities or landing sites would only be made as recommended by
fishery resource profiles to be financed under the project and as agreed by the Bank. Small-scale
infrastructure financed by village grants is exempted from this limitation.
.3. There would be an agreed set of Guidelines for Implementation of Tree Crop Development covering cropping
patterns, seed procurement, village nurseries, selection of farmers and financing.
4. There would be an agreed set of Guidelines for Implementation of Village Grants, covering infrastructure and
income-generating enterprises. The Guidelines would specify the types of infrastructure or income-directed
activities, village eligibility, the selection of proposals, maintenance, accounting and reporting.
Other Agreements Reached:
1. Land needed for civil works is either already acquired by Government, would be freely donated by
beneficiaries, or purchased from willing sellers. Land or assets required for village infrastructure would be
contributed voluntarily or contributed against compensation in accordance with the agreed Guidelines
for Compensation and Resettlement.
2. There would be no clearing of primary or secondary forest under the project for tree crop expansion; all
new areas to be planted would be grassland, brush or scrub forest and designated for agricultural
production or for conversion to agricultural conversion. Project funds would not be used for planting cacao.
3. No project funds would be utilized for increased fisheries exploitation, including boats,
motors, nets or other gear. Off-shore, deep water fish aggregation devices are allowed for Component B.

Annex 2
Detailed Project Description
Project Setting
Economy and Population. The Gross Regional Domestic Product (GRDP) per capita in Maluku was about 77%
of the national average and grew at about 5.8% during most of the last decade. Approximately 34% of GRDP is from
agriculture (including fisheries) with 20% from trade and 17% provided by services. Agriculture accounts for about 40%
of GRDP in each of the targeted kabupaten. The majority of Maluku's population of l.97 million is concentrated in two
geophysical areas: small islands historically chosen as naval strongholds (Ternate, Tidore, Ambon, Kai Kecil) and lightly
populated coastal areas of the larger islands. Nearly 90% of all villages are classified as coastal and 80% of the
provincial population is rural. These villages are primarily engaged in estate crops, subsistence farming and fishing. The
population density is low at 25 persons per km2, but lower still after exclusion of small, highly-populated islands. The
sea is an obstacle to typical rural/urban linkages. Villages are remote and may be roadless. No kecamatan in Maluku is
without coastline and Maluku has more small fishing boats than any province in Eastern Indonesia (although four
provinces in the east have significantly larger populations). The population share below the poverty line in Maluku was
about 10% higher than for Indonesia as a whole and higher than anywhere in the Eastern Islands except NTB (no data for
Irian Jaya). About 68% of the labor force were engaged in agriculture and fisheries versus 13% in public services and
another 8% in trade. Trend projections over the next few years show only a few percentage points drop in labor in
agriculture, picked up by manufacturing and trade.
Land Use and Agriculture. Data on land use point to extensive forest cover, a rugged interior, and large farm
holdings. Over 85% of the land area is forested or covered by bush (a higher percentage than any other eastern island
province); about 3% is under shifting cultivation. Upland agriculture, sawah and estate crops together account for less
than two percent and the remainder is grassland. Rainfall is fairly high in the north and rich volcanic soils are common.
About 90% of the land territory experiences only a few dry months per year and 90% is also below 1,000 meters in
elevation. Land holdings are large. Of households owning land, 42% have over two hectares which are often planted in
estate crops. This greatly surpasses the share of large holdings in other eastern provinces. Another 25% of households
have between one and two hectares while 20% have less than 0.25 hectares. Few households have intermediate-sized
holdings ranging from a quarter to one hectare.
The total planted area devoted to coconuts in Maluku (227,000 hectares in 1994) is double the area planted in
food crops and double the area in all other estate crops (cloves, cacao, nutmeg, coffee and cashew). Coconuts account
for 55%X) of planted area and a similar share of the value of agriculture production. Copra generates up to 60% of total
cash income in many rural villages. As mentioned above, smallholder coconut estates have very old and unproductive
palms, stagnant or declining yields, and are in need of rehabilitation. Significant new planting of traditional varieties is
occurring with inferior seedlings and little or no fertilizer. This limits future yields and lowers returns to labor. Cacao
areas have expanded rapidly over the last 1 5 years, averaging an  11% compounded annual growth rate. However, cacao
is seriously threatened by the pod borer moth.
Project Overview
This project builds on the existing cropping pattern by supporting low-risk tree crops in a sustainable system of
hybrid or local tall coconuts intercropped with coffee and food or forage crops in the first three years. The project
provides one year of grants and two years of loans for inputs. After a grace period, loans are repaid into a revolving
village fund where they complement village grants for infrastructure and credits for income-generation. Village grants
for infrastructure meet the most urgent demands identified during social assessment particularly for water supply.
Credits for income generation are on-lent within the village and repaid to village accounts. Grant awards are allocated on
a competitive system with village contributions of labor and capital. To increase profitability, agro-processing,
frequently linked to coconut products, is encouraged through demonstrations and extension. Processing would reduce

losses in storage and help overcome transportation costs and would be eligible for financing through the village credit
system. Losses due to disease and pests in livestock and crops are mitigated through demonstrations, extension and
control measures. Adopting these technologies can also be financed through revolving credit. Fisheries resource profiles
and improvements in handling, processing and marketing of these products would be supported, but the project would not
pay for increased fishing effort (boats and gears). Sea transportation and storage infrastructure are financed to improve
market linkages. A table containing the locations of project interventions appears at the end of this Annex and target
kecamatans are shown in Map 2 at the end of this document.
Project Description by Component
(Total costs with contingencies are shown in parentheses.)
A. Tree Crops Development and Rehabilitation ($ 4.2 million).
This component would provide financing for tree crops expansion, intensification and rehabilitation on 7,500
hectares owned by 15,000 low income coastal households. These households are located in 12 of the project's 15
kecamatans. Assistance for up to 0.5 hectares per household would be available in the form of grants for inputs for the
first year followed by two annual loans at "market" interest rates or a suitable proxy. Areas could either be existing tree
crop stands in need of replanting/intensification or new areas of grassland, brush or scrub forest. No clearing of primary
or secondary forest would be permitted under the project. The cropping pattern supported would be a choice of hybrid or
local tall varieties of coconut, intercropped with coffee or fruit trees and food or forage crops in the first three years.
This provides risk diversification and some income until new plantings become productive. In suitable areas with
adequate inputs, hybrids out perform local talls and provide added income. However, some farmers prefer local talls due
to disease and wind resistance and lower input requirements. Processing larger nuts found on local tall varieties is also
less labor intensive.
Seed Stock and Nurseries. Seed stock for local tall coconuts would be procured from high yielding palms within
high yielding blocks of local talls which have been identified by Dinas Perkubunan in each kecamatan. Seed stock of
hybrid coconuts would be procured from government seed farms in South Sulawesi (Bone-Bone) or Southeast Sulawesi
(Lainea). Nias dwarf crossed with Indonesian tall would be used. Although expensive at nearly Rp. 2,000 per seed
(versus Rp. 250 for local talls) there appears to be adequate availability oi hybrid seed stock. Seed for robusta coffee
would be sourced from the Center in Jember, East Java.
Farmer seed growers would participate in training on Nursery Methods for Tree Crops. This training would be
carried out in the village to be targeted under this component by extension workers with the support of PMO technical
personnel. A total of 326 training sessions of this type have been programmed under the project. An amount of Rp.
100,000 per training session has been allocated to cover the operational costs of this important activity. Participants who
have successfully completed this training would become eligible to participate in the project as seed growers for local tall
coconut or robusta coffee and would be provided with tools, a diesel water pump, inputs and a monetary incentive as part
of a contractual agreement with a PMU to supply seedlings under the project. Extension agents would select out about
30% of unsprouted or substandard seedlings. Base cost budgets for planting materials are: training Rp33 million,
coconut seeds Rp. 1,357 million, and coffee Rp. 1,327 million.
Through the BIPPs and in conjunction with the DG Estate Crops, the project would also provide training in the
control of coconut and coffee diseases and pests and intercropping techniques for farmers. Staff would be trained in
disease and pest control, farming systems development and extension melhods, management information systems and
other specialized areas.
Cropping Pattem. In cases of expanded area, food crops (paddy and groundnuts are likely) would be grown in
years 1-3 of the farming system and coffee or fruit trees would be planted in year three. The project would not finance
new cacao planting due to the threat of pod borer (but provides assistance fcor pest control in a separate component). The
project would finance intercropping existing coconut with coffee or fruit trees, replanting of coconut alone, or new, pure
stands of coconut. It would allow choice between food crops or forage crops and between coffee and fruit trees. Tree

Country: INDONESIA                        Project Title: MALUKU REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
crop development would not all be in the form of separate blocks of new palms (easier to supervise but sometimes sub-
optima.l for farmers) as under earlier tree crops projects. To concentrate benefits on lower-income farmers, households
having more than 300 coconut trees or more than four hectares under cultivation, would be excluded from this
component.
The proposed areas by kecamatan are shown in the following table.
Approximate Distribution of 7,500 hectares (15,000 Households)
of Tree Crops Development by Kecamatan
Tobelo        800  Kao    600  Oba   600   Piru            500
Galela        800  Malifut 200  Weda  600   Seram Utara 900
Morotai Selatan 800  Maba   700  Jailolo 500
Wasile  500
Financing. Grants for inputs would be limited to approximately $ 100/household in the first year of adoption.
Annual loans at "market" interest rates would be available for the following two years with a principle amount limited to
about $ 90/household for the sum of the two annual loans or approximately Rp. 600,000. There would be no loans for
food or fodder crops in years two and three but the grants in year one would cover food and fodder crops. (These
amounts would be adjusted for inflation and already allow a cushion over estimated costs). Repayment would begin after
a grace period covering the time until production begins. The interest free grace period would be four years in the case
of hybrid coconuts, and seven years in the case of coffee alone or local tall coconuts. Repayment would then be over
three years at "market" rates, of around 15% - 20% and harmonized with the rate under TSCDP. Loans would be repaid
not to the Ministry of Finance, as under sectoral tree crops projects, but to a village account controlled by the LKMD
where it could be used for on-lending to other adopters, to supplement village grants for or income-earning enterprises.
Repayment is faster than under most other tree crops projects which cover 1.0 hectare per farmer.
Implementation. Implementation would be by DG Estate Crops under a deconcentrated structure with a Pimpro
in Ambon and Project Management Units (PMUs). PMUs were established at Jailolo and Tobelo under the nearly-closed
TSCD'P and at Wahai and Maba from PRPTE. MRDP would finance an expansion of their coverage and new sub-PMUs
at Kao, Morotai Seletan, Oba and Wasile. Guidelines for Implementation of Tree Crop Development and Rehabilitation
would be agreed with the Bank and issued prior to disbursement under this component. Separate Guidelines for Credits
and Revolving Funds, acceptable to the Bank, would be issued to cover the operation of revolving credit accounts for the
Tree Crops and Community Development Components, by June 30, 1999. This component would be linked with credit
and demonstrations which could finance coconut log saw mills, to encourage replanting rather than expending the area,
and processing of copra and coconut products to reduce shipping costs relative to the value of the transported
commodity.
B. Community Development for Infrastructure and Income-Earning Activities (S 9.2 milliona.
To improve village welfare, relieve credit constraints and provide financing for technology adoption for agro-
processing and larger-scale investments, the project would establish kecamatan selection of village proposals for
infrastructure and income-generation. Because large-scale investments in irrigation infrastructure are already directed to
transm.igration villages, these areas would be excluded from participating in the village grants component. All other
villages in project kecamatans could submit proposals. Selection of proposals would be by a team chaired by the sub-
district chief (Camat), including PMD community development staff, dinas technical staff, and community facilitators.
The implementing agencies would be the three BAPPEDA Tk. II each of which would be assisted by a civil
engineer, a community development specialist and an accountant. There would be a coordinating Pimpro at the
Provincial level. The Camat and the UDKP would assist with planning and implementation at the kecamatan level with
suppoit from two community facilitators per kecamatan, one having a civil engineering background (for infrastructure)

Country: INDONESIA                        Project Tide: MALUKU REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
and one with a agriculture business-economics background (for income-generation). Community facilitators would be
trained to assist community based groups, organizations and village leaders in planning, proposal development and
implementation. Local community organizers would be financed through honoraria to provide direct and continuing
assistance to LKMDs with proposals and implementation. Assistance from NGOs would also be sought. The project
would also train BAPPEDA Tk. II staff in planning, monitoring and evaluation methods and would provide kecamatan
level training and workshops for LKMDs.
Selected proposals, based on Village Action Plans, would receive grant financing, but in the case of income-
generation, funds would be on-lent within the village and repaid to a revolving credit account. Proposals for all activities
would be formulated with community participation and reviewed at the village, kecamatan and kabupaten levels. Project
funds would flow directly to village accounts controlled by the LKMI) which would have over-all implementation
responsibility at the village level. Guidelines for Implementation of Village Grants, acceptable with the Bank as a
condition of disbursement. Separate Guidelines for Credits and Revolving Funds, acceptable to the Bank, would be
issued by June 30, 1999, would cover the operation of village accouints, repayment, and relending for both this
component and the Tree Crops component.
(1) Grants for Village Infrastructure ($6.1 million). The first project year would be used to establish systems,
develop proposals, and prepare for actual expenditures. A subset of half the kecamatans which are larger would be
selected for start-up in year two with the other kecamatans following thereafter. There would be phasing in of the
numbers of awards or villages financed per kecamatan. The details of this phasing are contained in the following tables.
Grants of up to Rp. 100 million ($ 20,000) per village would be made for infrastructure. The more successful villages
would be eligible for a second grant but individual villages could receive no more than two grants over the life of the
project. However, the limit of Rp. 100 million ($20,000) would be reviewed annually to adjust for inflation. About 60%
of villages in targeted kecamatans would receive infrastructure grants if each were awarded the maximum and there were
no repeat villages. Selection criteria would include technical feasibility, community participation in planning and
implementation, cost-sharing in the form of labor, material, and cash, benefits reaching the majority of the community,
and the presence of a local community organizer. Grants can be used for hiring village labor at a discount to market
rates. Proposals should include plans for operation and maintenance. Village contributions should be in the order of
10% - 20% of total costs. Project supported infrastructure would be water supply systems, sanitation facilities, village
drainage, small-scale irrigation (up to 50 hectares), sea walls, village jetties, bridges, culverts, simple road improvements,
diesel electricity generation (hydro is excluded due to expense) and public market structures. Project funds could not be
used for religious building (mosques, temples, churches), monuments or statues. Selected infrastructure should not be
detrimental to the environment, require land acquisition, or displace households. If land acquisition cannot be avoided
through voluntary contributions or moving structures, detailed guidelines for acquisition and compensation will follow
the Project Manual for the Village Infrastructure Project (P3DT). Technical assistance for design and construction would
be provided.
(2) Credits for Income-Earning Enterprises (3.1 million). Grants to villages would become on-lent as credits to
groups for income-generation activities. Groups would need to have at least ten members. These credits would also be
awarded by the kecamatan based on competitive village proposals for on-lending to individuals or groups of farmers,
fishers, processors, and small businesses. It has been agreed with Tk. II staff that organizations as well as villages could
apply for grants and credits. Individuals or groups would repay annual loans at "market" interest rates (about 20%) into a
village account with the local (kecamatan) branch of BRI for revolving credit within the village. Assistance with funds
management would be provided by BRI, both for revolving credit for income-generation and for repayment of loans for
tree crops development. The maximum allowed credit would be Rp. 50 million ($10,000), subject to annual review. The
phasing and coverage would be identical to infrastructure grants.

This table used the phasing of awards per kecamatan in the next table and a limit of up
to Rp. 100 million ($20,000) for infrastructure and Rp. 50 million ($10,000) for income generation
per village or organization. These limits would be reviewed annually.
Coverage if every award is at the maximum and no repeat villages:
Total awards at maximum amount: 229      Total villages 371
The coverage ratio is 62% if no repeat villages and all awards are at maximum.
Smaller awards would raise coverage; repeat villages lowers coverage. The potential
coverage would be the same for infrastructure and income-generation.

Guidelines Issues. Selection of proposals would be based on economic soundness, broad-benefits to the
community, managerial and technological capacity, sustainability and neutral or positive environmental impact. The
mechanism and operating procedures for this component would be detailed in the Guidelines for Implementation of
Village Grants and the Guidelines for Credits and Revolving Funds. Some of the issues to be addressed for income-
generation, which involves revolving credit are:
LKMD to open an account in BRI
Repayment period: 3 years at "market" rates
At least one-third of awards will target women's groups.
Funds will be repaid to a village account.
Funds will only be lent to groups which have a minimum of 10 people
Churches, mosques, and organizations may submit proposals
Eligible Activities for income generation under the Community Development Component.  This list is for
illustration purposes only and is not final. Activities which are primarily for women's groups are marked with "W".
(a) Agriculture Production:
cacao pod borer control;
livestock acquisition or fattening is allowed (but not inputs for annual crops);
nurseries for tree crops;
other
(b) Post Harvest Processing:
mini coconut mills
coconut wood sawmills
coconut boards and knock-down furniture

other
These activities would often be linked to demonstrations and extension supported under component C. With
regard to fisheries, because of World Bank policies and risks of over-exploitation, project funds could not be used to
finance fishing boats, nets, motors, or other gears.
Environmental Review: The Guidelines for Implementation of Village Grants will include a checklist for
community facilitators and engineers to review the potential environmental impacts of the proposed "intervention" with
mitigation if required . All infrastructure projects would be screened following GOI's Standard-Operating-Procedures for
small-scale infrastructure activities.
C. Support Services for AgricXlture and Fisheries ($ 3.7 million).
(1) Processing and Marketing ($0.7 million). The value of household-scale processing in Maluku Tengah
doubled from 1988 to 1993, reaching Rp. 4.9 billion. This momentum needs to be encouraged to increase returns to
agriculture and over-come transportation constraints. Beyond the household level, there is a need for village and
commercial-scale processing activities. Processing demonstrations are supported under this sub-component at the village
level and under the following component at the household level, both of which would be eligible for revolving credit
from village grants. During the first three years of implementation, the project would undertake larger-scale prototype
agro-processing in cooperation with NGOs, farmer and fisher groups in the 15 targeted kecamatan. Replication of these
demonstrations would occur under Component B. The initial processing activities would include:
* mini coconut oil mills (2 tons/day)
* coconut wood sawmills;
* processing palm sugar;
* clove oil processors;
* fish smokers;
* fish dryers (for ikan teri or other fish).
Expansion during years four through six would depend on these results and the marketing initiatives. The component
would help villages formulate proposals for income-generation grants to villages. The sub-component would also
establish a small marketing unit technical assistance based in Ambon to identify markets and buyers and help establish
trade linkages for coconut products, coconut wood, fish and marine products and essential oils. It would provide price
information and help guide the prototype processing to be undertaken and assist with issues of product quality.
(2) Animal Health and Extension ($0.9 million). Surveys of farmer groups have identified improved animal
health as a priority, particularly the control of Newcastle disease in chickens, scabies in goats, and cattle parasites and
diseases. This component would complement the cattle distribution and veterinary medicine interventions of the IFAD
project. The subcomponent would:
* Establish three district-level Centers for Agricultural Information and Extension (Balai Informasi dan
Penyuluhan Pertanian - BIPP) in Masohi, Ternate and Tidore;

Country: INDONESIA                       Project Title: MALUKU REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
8 Upgrade ten Rural Extension Centers (BPP) in Seram Utara, Piru (Seram Barat), Amahai, tobelo, Balela, Kao,
Jailolo, 'Wasile, Weda and Oba.
v  Establish Animal Health Clinics (POSKESWAN) at Morotai Selatan, Malifut, Oba, Weda and Maba, and
upgrade existing units at Wahai and Tobelo.
Training would be provided to BIPP and BPP heads, extension agents and key farmers in farming systems, tree
crops, pest control, and some post harvest processing. The Dinas Tk. II Livestock would be assigned responsibility for
carrying out in 7 kecamatans: (a) training of village cadres in poultry vaccination techniques to control Newcastle disease
and provision of vaccines; (b) demonstrations for control and treatment of scabies in goats; (c) demonstrations for control
and trealment of parasites for all livestock. The project would finance civil works, procurement of equipment, training of
agency staff and area farmers and operational funding. To compliment the IFAD-assisted Eastern Islands Smallholder
Farming; System and Livestock Development Project, MRDP under this subcomponent would be concentrated in Buru
Utara Timor, Morotai Selatan, Malifut, Wasile, Oba, Weda and Maba.
(3) Technology Dffiision ($1.0 million). To respond to farmer requests for control of pests and disease in tree
crops and food crops, and to stimulate proposals for the use of grant funds under component B, the project would provide
assistance for technology diffusion and demonstrations. The Ambon AIAT in cooperation with the Centers for
Agriculture Information and Extension (BIPPs) in the three kabupaten would facilitate a series of farm/site
demonstrations. The project would also support ten small, Rural Extension Centers in the three kabupatens. The
demonstrations would be implemented by farmer groups and community organizations in accordance with local needs
and preferences. Financing from the income-generation credits would be available to help adopt these and other
technologies. Examples of likely demonstration activities are:
* control of cocoa pod borer moths (mostly through timely and frequent harvesting and pruning);
* control of coconut beetles (saxes);
* control of coconut crown rot;
* coconut intercropping;
* coconut oil and nata di coco production with long storage life;
* use of by-products and forages for livestock and poultry;
* cassava and yam chip processing;
* construction and testing of cold boxes for fish storage;
* culture and post-harvest processing of sea weed;
* introduction of corn hullers and bean threshers.
This subcomponent would also enable the Ambon AIAT to provide short-term training to BIPP, PPL and PPS (extension
agents). Technical assistance in the form of and agricultural economist and an anthropologist/sociologist, as well as
short-term consultants would be financed. Workshops and extension materials such as leaflets, publications, translation
of brochures, textbooks, videos, etc., would also be financed.
(4) Fisheries andMarine Support ($0.6 million). Fisheries and coastal marine resource profiles would be
carried out for the entire province on the 20 most important species. Importance would be determined not just by
commercial value but would include subsistence consumption. The profiles would include demersal species, trochus,
and other marine products (e.g., sea cucumbers,) and pelagic species. These profiles would guide development and
management. The profile for each species/group should include:
* The resource (species present, distribution, biology/ecology)
* The fishery (production, marketing)
* Stock status (results of studies, indications from nearby areas and related species)
* Management (present management, recommended management)
* References (published, unpublished)

Country: INDONESIA                       Project Tide: MALUKU REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
The studies would also make recommendations on whether or not investnent in shore facilities (sites and services,
marketing areas, provision of electricity or landing structures) would be productive investments and would attract private
matching investment in fisheries infrastructure. About 70% of the amount under this subcomponent ($ 0.4 million)
would be available for on-shore facilities but could only be released on the recommendation of these investigations and
with Bank approval.
(5) Seed Multiplication for Irrigated Agriculture ($0.5 million). To complement other investments in irrigation
development, the project would finance seed multiplication for irrigated agriculture in transmigration areas to cover
approximately 19,000 hectares in Seram Utara and on Halmahera. Seeds would primarily be suitably-selected high-
yielding varieties of paddy. Seed growers would participate in short training courses and be provided with paddy
extension seed, tools and inputs during the first year to produce high-yield ing varieties of paddy on one hectare per seed-
grower. The project would finance improvement of the main Food Crop Seed Multiplication Facility at Kairatu (BBI)
and establish two new Seed Farms (BBU) at Wasile and Seram Utara. Since irrigated agriculture is new to these areas,
local seed stock and private sector seed initiatives are lacking. However, it is expected that once trained and supported,
seed growers would eventually become private operators and no longer be under contract.
D. Sea Transportation and On-Shore Facilities ($ 1.8 million!
Inter-island and inter-provincial trade is totally dependent on sea transportation. Several good quality docks have
been constructed with bilateral (Dutch) assistance--Wahai on Seram, on Buru, and south of Kao--and a new dock at Kobi
Sadar on Seram can handle 115 - 150 ton ships. These are lit, concrete structures with accompanying harbor lights but
some lack any other facilities. In other areas, docks are wood structures which are collapsing, or are primitive jetties.
Expanding road networks reduce the requirement for within-island shipping infrastructure. However, there remains an
ummet need for upgrading and in some cases new structures to handle larger shipments and cargo which is inefficient to
truck or is destined for inter-island trade. In some cases, these dock improvements are to be accompanied by small,
block-house (200 square meter) storage facilities. The docks and storage are typically managed together. Storage (total
cost less than 1% of the project) would not be built where the private sector is active or viable such as in Tobelo and
Amahai. The crowding-out effects on the private sector are judged to be minimal given that financing would be for
single, 10 meter x 20 meter structures. Benefits from dock improvements and storage facilities are reduced marketing
costs and fewer losses and increased safety. (E.g., around Buli bay, some goods are carried through high surf and boats
cannot land in rough seasons.) New dock construction with a storage sbtucture would be built at Buli (70 meters x 8
meters) and Bicoli (35 meters by 8 meters) in kecamatan Maba. The location and desirability of the wharf and storage
facility at Bicoli will be reviewed depending on the pace of road construction and these funds may be allocation to
another location or to expand and improve the design intended for the larger facility at Buli. Buli is the planned new
kabupaten center for Halmahera Tengah. Dock extensions would be financed (without additional storage) at two major
transportation hubs of Tobelo and Amahai (the latter would be a 50 meter extension). Storage alone would be
constructed at Weda, Jailolo, Wahai, Namlea and Subiam on Wasile Bay. This component would be implemented by the
office of KanWil Perhubungan. Design and site sketches can be found in Annex 4 of the Preparation Report.
E. Capacity Building for Project Management. Coordination. Monitoring and Evaluation ($1.6 million).
Training, technical assistance and equipment would be provided to strengthen the capacity of the following
agencies to carry out implementation of MRDP and other development initiatives in the province.
* BAPPEDA Tk. I in Ambon and BAPPEDA Tk. II in the three kabupatens to coordinate annual planning,
monitoring and evaluation of all MRDP activities; to account for project finances; to plan and facilitate marine stock
assessments and management plans; and to formulate development plans for the Sula Islands (Maluku Utara) and
Kecamatan Seram Timur (Maluku Tengah). A Baseline Survey of income, cropping patterns and indicative yields,
credit access, and village infrastructure would be contracted by BAPPEDA Tk I to be used in assessing project impact.
The Baseline Survey should be completed by December 15, 1998. Follow-on surveys of impact would also be
conducted. BAPPEDA Tk. I and Tk. II would also organize a Project Dissemination Plan to familiarize beneficiaries in

target villages an implementing agencies with the project and delivery mechanism. The plan would be designed by June
1, 1998 and implemented by November 15, 1998.
* Camat offices in 15 kecamatan and village institutions to carry out coordination, proposal evaluation and
supervision of village infrastructure and income-generation activities under component B.
* The KanWil Perindustrian in cooperation with the provincial chamber of commerce (KADINDA) to conduct
market surveys and market development work, promote investment opportunities in agricultural processing, and
implement pilot agro-processing.
Assistance would be provided to BPN for kecamatan mapping and for publishing Base Maps Data for the 15
kecamatan to improve spatial planning and environmental management. These maps would be digitized and would
include important ecological features such as mangroves, beach forests, fresh water lakes, etc., which would further the
objectives of the companion Maluku Conservation and Natural Resources Management Project.

Cost Benefit Analysis Summary
Summary of Benefits and Costs
Approximately 50% of project costs produce quantifiable benefits. These costs correspond to project
components for Tree Crops Development; Support Services for Agriculture and Fisheries, and Sea Transportation and
On-Shore Facilities. Within the Support Services component, quantifiable benefits would result from Processing and
Marketing, Technology Diffusion for Agriculture, and Seed Multiplication for Irrigated Agriculture. The Community
Development component and the subcomponents for Animal Health and Fisheries Support, have not been subjected to
detailed analysis. Village grants for infrastructure would meet identified village needs for water supply, sanitation,
drainage, sea walls, jetties, small bridges, culverts and road improvements. Grants to villages which would be on-lent
to groups as credits for income generation, would allow adoption of technology for pest and disease control, post-
harvest processing, or community-scale coconut oil mills, coconut wood sawmills, palm sugar, cacao dryers, tree crop
nurseries, rice/corn hullers, fish dryers and smokers, etc., and non-agricultural activities. These village grants for
infrastructure and credits for income-generation, would be assessed for technological and economic feasibility prior to
allocating resources. Community scale processing has been analyzed for coconut oil processing, coconut wood
sawmill, palm sugar and clove and nutmeg oil processing and returns from these activities would be similar to the
analysis of the Processing and Marketing subcomponent but would not be loaded with the additional overheads of
demonstrations and a marketing unit. There is considerable value added from processing and preserving fish, which
avoids spoilage and raises market prices, and from avoiding mortality and morbidity in chickens, goats, and cattle.
These were leading village priorities, but no quantified analysis has been undertaken of their economic benefits for
Component B.
During preparation, initial ERRs for the quantified components with the exchange rate at Rp. 3,000/$ were:
Tree Crops (Local Talls):  23.2
Processing and Marketing:    14.4
Agricultural Extension:    34.7
Seed Multiplication:       87.8
Sea Transportation:        17.8
A change in the exchange rate does not impact world prices but lowers the US $ equivalent of labor and non-
traded inputs vis-a-vis tradable commodities. This particularly impacts tree crops which are labor intensive and
boosts returns. The tree crops ERR rises to 36.7% after revaluation of all labor inputs using Rp. 4,000/$ and inclusion
of hybrid coconuts for one-third of the adopters. The base case tree crops model assumes one- third of farmers adopt
local tall coconuts with low inputs, one-third adopt local tall coconuts with moderate inputs after project termination,
and one-third adopt hybrid coconuts with high inputs. In all cases, coconuts are intercropped with coffee and three
years of food crops. Project areas under adoption are phased in through time. An average 20% share of costs
attributable to labor was estimated for the other components and labor costs were correspondingly adjusted to an
exchange rate of Rp. 4,000 for the Base Case. Additional analysis was subsequently undertaken using Rp. 5,000/$.
To aggregate these returns into a project rate of return for quantified components, half of the costs for
component E, Capacity Building for Project Management, Coordination and M&E are added in, reflecting the
approximate share of project costs devoted to quantified outcomes. The composite ERR was 23.7% at Rp. 3,000 but
rises to 34.5% when labor is converted using Rp. 4,000 and one-third of farmers adopt hybrid coconuts. The Present
Values are shown below for the base case of Rp. 4,000. It should be noted that the exchange rate change also alters
the weights of components since their labor share of costs varies. Further sensitivity analysis of the exchange rate is
presented at the end of this Annex.

Main Assumptions
1. Tree Crops ($5.6 million).
Economic returns from the Tree Crops component are derived fiom farm models using parity prices. Export
parity prices were used for copra, robusta coffee, and urea; import parity prices were used for triple super phosphate
(TSP) and potassium chloride (KCI). The average of farmn gate import and export parity prices were used for rice,
given Bulog's stock management practices (the Government logistics and trade agency), and for maize and
groundnuts. The forecast prices are summarized below. The project is expected to reach 15,000 farmers who would
each establish or rehabilitate 0.5 hectares of local coconut intercropped with coffee and grow three years of food crops
to boost income in the early period prior to tree crop maturity. Half the farmers are assumed to expand onto an
additional 0.5 hectares a few years after start-up without direct project support. (Indirect support for local tall
coconuts would remain in the form of village nurseries).

The base case cropping pattern on a one hectare plot would be hybrid or local tall varieties of coconut selected
from better performing stock with an intensity of 120 palms/hectare; intercropped with 460 robusta coffee
trees/hectare (4m x 4m grid) planted in year three. In years one to three, 0.5 hectares of rice and 0.5 hectares of
peanuts (groundnuts) would be intercropped. Fertilizer applications would cease after three years in the low input
case for local tall coconuts. In the high input case, 68 kg/hectare each of urea and TSP, plus 38 kglhectare of K Cl
would continue to be applied to coconut over the 20 year period (after initial phase in). Hybrid coconuts are assumed
to receive 60 kg/hectare of urea, 90 kg/hectare of TSP and 45 kg/hectare of K Cl. Fertilizer assumptions for coffee
were, after phase in, urea: 32 kglhectare; TSP: 40 kg/hectare; and K Cl: 21 Kg/hectare. The corresponding yield
assumptions are shown below. These are considered to be quite consenrative given that provincial average copra
yields have been around 1.4 tons/hectare, and 1.5 in the target areas, based on productive palms and little fertilizer.
The provincial average coffee yield for smallholders has been around 450 kglhectare.

t- Yields are quoted on a per hectare intercropped basis, but a one-hectare farm model would have 0.5 hectares each
of rice and groundnuts. Copra yields based on local talls varieties in the "High Input" case are lower than for hybrids in
the "High" case. The project only supports a one-half hectare package per household.
The project would provide one year of inputs on a grant basis with a value of under $100/household (this
would correspond to the cropping pattern on 0.5 hectares) and two years of annual loans at market interest rates with a
value of about $ 80/household for both years. Labor requirements are 90 days in the first year for copra and 68 days
during full production for talls; 80 and 70 days per hectare per year for paddy and groundnuts; and 52 days rising to
72 days for coffee. These assumptions are for the low input case. Labor is higher for hybrid coconuts. Farm model
and component returns are computed after payment of imputed labor costs. Land preparation is included. Further
details of labor requirements and other inputs and assumptions are contained in project files, Annex 5 of the
Preparation Report.
Average farm income in the target area was estimated to be Rp. 1,173,000 per year, with a drop forecast due
to price projections and declining productivity. Incremental income from the 0.5 hectares in the project would be
Rp.555,000 for the low input model and Rp. 678,000 in the high input case after full production for local tall coconuts
and coffee. This represents a 49% and a 61% increase in farm income, respectively, over projected future income
without the project. In the case of hybrids, by year 14, incremental income would be Rp. 880,000, or a 75% increase
for 0.75 hectares.
Farm model economic rates of return at Rp. 3,000/ $ are:
Low Inputs, Local Tall Coconuts with Coffee:           26.1%
High Inputs, Local Tall Coconuts with Coffee:          29.9%
High Inputs, Hybrid Coconuts with Coffee:              36.1%
Assuming one-third of adopters are in each category, total project hectarage is phased in, project overheads for this
component are added, and labor costs are converted to USD using Rp. 4,000, the resulting aggregate ERR for the tree
crops component is 36.7%.
Farm models which substituted cacao for coffee in the intercropping pattern had returns of approximately
20% and 23% for the low and high input models. Yields were assumed to reach 250 kg/hectare and 450 kg/hectare
for the two cases. Not only were the returns lower for cacao than for coffee using these yields, but losses due to pod
borer could significantly cut income and returns. (This analysis was at Rp. 3,000/$ and can be compared to the above
table.)



Project Appraisal Document                                                               Page 42
Country: INDONESIA                        Project Title: MALUKU R EGIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Coffee intensification, which is supported by the project, resulted in farm model returns of 22% and 32% for
low and high inputs, but had lower increments to total income than the base case pattern. Local coconuts grown under
a monocrop program had a return of 15%. By comparison, the intercrop base case has the appeal of risk
diversification and a higher impact on income. (This analysis was at Rp. 3,000/$ and can be compared to the above
table.)
The benefits from technology diffusion of selected, better-performing local coconut varieties provided from
village nurseries, intercropped with coffee and food crops in the early years, was not analyzed. However, targeting
0.5 hectares per household and having the loans for inputs in the second and third years repaid to the village is meant
to encourage further adoption by initial farmers as well as neighbors.
2. Processing and Marketing ($ 0.8 million).
Annex 3 of the Working Papers of the Preparation Report (August, 1997) contains detailed financial analyses
of the processing activities listed below, including prices of inputs and outputs, machinery costs, conversion ratios,
management expenses, etc. Coconut oil processing (2 tons/day), coconut wood sawmills, palm sugar processors,
clove oil processors and nutmneg oil processors were evaluated. The Financial Internal Rates of Return estimated for
these activities range from 26% for palm sugar to over 100% for clove and nutmeg oil processing. The project would
finance processing demonstrations and development of market linkages which lower returns for the component as a
whole. No assumptions regarding the benefits of replication were included in benefits, although some of these
activities are expected to be undertaken by villages through Grants Cornponent for income generation. Without
replications, and fully loading project component costs on the returns of the demonstration enterprises, this
component is estimated to have an ERR of 14.4% at Rp. 3,000/$.
3. Technology Diffusion for Agriculture ($ 1.5 million).
This subcomponent represents half of the costs for Animal Health and Technology Diffusion under the
Support Services component. No attempt was made to estimate the benefits from vaccinations and improved
livestock care. However, a rough estimate was made of the potential impact of technology diffusion for control of
cacao pod borer. No cacao planting is supported under the project due to expected losses from this tree crop pest.
Ten out of 16 surveyed farmer groups listed control of this moth as a high priority for improving income. Yield
losses on cacao plantations on Seram have been as high as 30-40% even with some control measures. Frequent and
timely pruning and harvesting, as well as burying infected fruit, are considered to be an effective and lower cost
control regime compared to attempted eradication or use of chemicals or physical barriers (plastic bags). Reducing
cacao losses from this pest is a leading objective for this subcomponent. The total value of cacao production in the
targeted kabupatens is projected to be above $3.5 million in the year 2000 using economic prices. The economic farm
gate price of cacao based on export parity is forecast to be $ 0.88/kg in 2000, rising gently to $ 0.92 in 2005, and $
0.97 by 2010. For the economic analysis of this component, it was assumed that the project would affect one-half the
planted area in Maluku Utara and Maluku Tengah; and one-third the area planted to cacao in Halmahera Tengah. It
was further assumed that control measures would avoid yield losses of 15% due to pod borer on the following path:
no impact in years 1 and 2 of implementation; 5% loss avoidance in year 3; [0% in year 4; 15% in years 5 through 10.
The benefit stream was terminated at year 10 for this exercise. The resulling ERR was 34.7% at Rp. 3,000/$. No
benefits from other technology or extension were estimated.
4. Seed Multiplication for Irrigated Agriculture ($ 0.7 million).
Improved seed multiplication would reach smallholder paddy producers in semi-technical irrigated areas as
well as those using village irrigation systems in the form of higher yields. Although about 18,000 hectares will be
under paddy production in the project area, it was assumed only 67% of farnners in the semi-technical irrigated sawah
areas and 40% of farmers using village irrigation would utilize improved seed. The areas affected by the seed
multiplication component would be phased in slowly as follows:

Country: INDONESIA                         Project Title: MALUKU REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Phasing of Areas Affected by Improved Seed Multiplication (Hectares)
Year  1       2       3      4     5      6-20
Semi-Technical Irrigation         0      500   1,000  2,000  3,000  6,000
Village Irrigation                0      300     600  1,000  3,000  4,000
The contribution of improved seed to paddy yields was assumed to be 0.45 tons per hectare for semi-
technical irrigation (from 3.6 tons/hectare to 4.05 tons/hectare) and 0.5 tons per hectare for village irrigation (from 2.5
tons/hectare to 3.0 tons/hectare). The assumed cropping intensity for semi-technical irrigation was 2.25 and 1.5 for
village irrigation. In the farm models estimated, five additional days of labor would be required in the "with project"
case. If improved water management and other practices were adopted, the yield increases could be double that
assumed in the analysis (to 4.5 tons for better controlled irrigation and 3.5 tons for village irrigation) but this would
entail costs and interventions not directly supported by the project.
5. Sea Transportation and On-Shore Facilities ($ 2.2 million).
Marketing costs for standard commodities were compared at improved and unimproved ports in
Maluku. At unimproved ports, goods could not be shipped directly from the province to Ujung Pandang or Surabaya
since larger ships with this range could not dock. Unloading, handling, and reloading commodities at transshipment
points added Rp. 25 - 100 / kg to marketing costs. Waiting times would also be reduced from dock extensions at
busier ports. For the Tobelo and Amahai ports, where improvement is planned under the project, it was assumed that
60% of the production of copra, cacao, nutmeg and cloves from these kecamatans and the neighboring kecamatans
(Galela for Tobelo and Tehoru for Amahai) would be shipped through the improved port facilities with a marketing
cost reduction of Rp. 35/kg. A similar consumer savings on imports through these ports was also assumed. For the
new dlocks of Buli and Bicoli, it was assumed that 60% of the production of copra, cacao, nutmeg and cloves from
Kecarnatan Maba would be shipped through these facilities at a marketing cost savings of Rp. 75/kg since the existing
infrastructure is much more basic and seasonally unusable. No savings on handling incoming cargo was assumed.
Furthermore, no benefits from storage facilities were quantified although losses in storage are expected to be reduced.
A conservative commodity volume growth rate of 3% per year was assumed. These assumptions produced an ERR of
17.80/% at Rp. 3,000/$.
Sensitivity Analysis/Switching Values of Critical Items
Exchange Rates. It should be noted that when the exchange rate changes in the analysis, say from Rp. 3,000
to Rp. 4,000, this does not imply that labor costs have risen to a higher rupiah value; rather a given number of days at
a given wage rate are now converted to fewer dollars and compared with world prices for inputs and outputs in the
production system. Thus a weaker currency raises retums to tradable commodities in economic terms, depending on
the labor share in costs, which is high for tree crops after establishment. As mentioned above, an average cost share
of 20% labor was used for other components. The impact on the project of varying exchange rates is:
ERR Sensitivity to Exchange Rates
ERR (%) NPV Discounted at 10% ($ million)
Labor Converted at Rp. 3,000/$     25.7                  12.1
Labor Converted at Rp. 4,000/$     34.5                  17.4
Labor Converted at Rp. 5,000/$     45.4                 22.7
(Covers quantifiable benefits, associated costs and 50% of overhead costs, comprising 46% of project costs.)

Country: INDONESIA                        Project Title: MALUKU REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Inflation.  There is no sensitivity of the ERR to overall inflation, since the analysis is done constant prices.
However, there is sensitivity to differential changes in prices.
Tree Crops Prices. The project ERR sensitivity to changes in tree crops prices is set out below. Even a 40%
price decrease leaves the project viable given the high returns to labor. A 40% price drop with labor converted at Rp.
2,500/$ would have left the project non-viable. The Base Case below uses farmgate export parity prices based on
World Bank price forecasts in constant terms.
ERR Sensitivity to Changes in Tree (Crops Prices
(Labor at Rp. 4,000/$)
Price Change               ERR (%)
40% Price Increase          47.6
20% Price Increase          41.1
Base Case                   34.5
20% Price Decrease          27.8
40% Price Decrease          20.4
Fully Loading Project Costs on Quantified Benefits. The projecit components having unquantified benefits
account for approximately 50% of total costs. If these costs are fully included without any adjustment in benefits, the
ERR for the project would be 23.9%. In other words, this calculation assumes there are zero benefits from half of the
project which does not have directly quantifiable benefits, namely: village infrastructure, village income generating
activities, animal health services, fisheries studies and management (and possible shore facilities for fisheries), and
half of the institution building and project management costs. The ERR does not drop dramatically since a large share
of costs are farm labor and inputs not paid for by the project; hence adding all other project costs does not double total
costs. The sensitivity of the ERR to project overhead costs associated with quantifiable benefits is therefore much
less than the sensitivity to full costs paid inside and outside the project as presented in the table below. Each 10%
increase in project overheads associated with known benefits lowers the ERR by 1.5%
Delayed Benefits. Delaying the start-up of benefits by one or two years would lower returns as shown below.
This table is based on half of the project costs with quantified benefits and half of management overhead. These
figures assume costs are unchanged in timing both for the project as well as inputs and labor not financed by the
project. A one year delay in benefits has about the same impact on returns as a 20% reduction in benefits (c.f. the
following paragraph).
Effects of Delayed Benefits
I-,,R (%)
Assumed Implementation Schedule:     34.5
One Year Delay in Benefits:          24.7
Two Years Delay in Benefits:         19.1
Higher Costs and Lower Benefits. Higher than expected costs and lower benefits can combine to limit the
viability of a project. Lower benefits could result form disappointing yields, adverse prices for inputs or outputs,
broken market linkages, lower trade volumes (for sea transportation), etc. The following table illustrates the effects of
higher costs (10%, 20% and 30% higher) and lower benefits (10%, 20% and 30% lower) on returns.

0.7           19.9   16.7   13.8   11.3
Note: This table is based on half of the project costs having quantifiable benefits and
50% of other overheads are added on from component E for project management. The cost
multiplier is applied to all project financed costs with associated benefits, half of project
management benefits, and all non-project financed costs during and after implementation.
Switching Values. A 30% reduction in project benefits together with a 30% increase in project costs would
produce an ERR of 11 %. Note that this rise in costs would not be the result of overall inflation which does not effect
economic prices, but would have to result from cost over-runs inside and outside the project. (Costs in later years are
not associated with the MRDP investment operation, but represent, for example, labor and farm inputs.)
Conclusion. The returns to quantifiable components appear to be acceptably robust to adverse developments
and are favorable impacted by a weaker currency due to the conversion of labor to lower values in dollar terms.

Annex 6
Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements
Procurement
Goods and works will be procured in accordance with provisions of the "Guidelines for Procurement
under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" dated January, 1995, which were revised in January and August of 1996
and in September, 1997. Standard Bidding Documents will be used for all Bank-financed procurement. The
GOI will finance all vehicles from the government development budget or provide used vehicles. Contracts
for civil works are expected to be small in size and dispersed throughout the three targeted kabupatens. These
will be contracted through National Competitive Bidding procedures as found acceptable to the Bank.
Equipment and furniture will be procured through National Conmpetitive Bidding except for certain small
scale purchases which would be through National Shopping Procedures. National Shopping Procedures
require that quotations be obtained from at least three qualified suppliers on the basis of a detailed description
and quantity of goods, as well as the desired delivery time and place. Goods, works, and services financed
under Sub-Projects through village grants would be procured according to Community Participation methods
agreed with the Bank. Employment of consultants and the format for consultants' contracts will be based on
the "Guidelines for Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" dated January,
1997 and revised in September, 1997; and on the "Standard Request for Proposal" dated July, 1997. For
contracts valued at $ 100,000 or more for civil works, goods and consulting services provided by firms; and
for contracts valued at $ 50,000 or more for consulting services provided by individuals, the Bank requires
prior approval of terms of reference, short lists, letters of invitation, recommendations for award and the final
contract. The procurement methods to be used for the project are indicated in Table A of this Annex.
Procurement Methods (Table A)
Civil Works (US$ 2.3 million). Civil works will be procured through National Competitive Bidding
(NCB) procedures for contracts for $50,000 or more, and through procedures for procurement of small works
for contracts of less than US$ 50,000 (up to $ 500,000 in aggregate).
Goods (US$ 4.5 million). This category includes equipment and furniture to be procured by the
BAPPEDAs and BIPPs and other concerned agencies for their respective components; mapping imagery and
equipment; and agricultural inputs to be procured by the Dinas Tree Crops and Dinas Food Crops and farming
machinery, pumps and processing equipment. Contracts valued at US$ 50,000 or more will be awarded
through NCB procedures for processing equipment, other equipment and furniture. Agricultural inputs valued
at $ 50,000 or more will be procured through NCB. Equipment and furniture with an aggregate value of
$200,000, agricultural inputs with an aggregate value of $700,000; and publications, mapping, and
information materials with an aggregate value of $ 300,000, estimated to cost less than $ 50,000 equivalent
per contract, will be procured through National Shopping Procedu:res acceptable to the Bank. Procurement
under National Shopping Procedures will not exceed $ 1,200,000 in the aggregate.
Vehicles (US$ 0.3 million). GOI will procure vehicles for ithe project under government procedures,
in accordance with the schedule agreed with the Bank.
Service Delivery Contracts (US$ 0.7 million). Service Delivery Contracts will be used for contracting
farmers for seed production, and for processing demonstrations and replications under components A, C (1)
and C (5) of the project, respectively, using procedures agreed with the Bank as follows: farmers will be
selected and subcontracted by Pimpros for each component on the basis of community standing; sufficient

land for the planned activity; having successfully completed prior training; and not being a member of the
LKMD or the Kepala Desa.
Training (US $ 0.5 million). Training will be conducted through GOI procedures acceptable to the
Bank by AIAT, Ambon, and BIPP offices concerned in conjunction with other government agencies.
Research, Surveys and Special Studies (US$ 0.5 million). Quality- and Cost-Based Selection (QCBS)
will be used to procure technical assistance for fishery resource profiles and recommendations regarding on-
shore infrastructure.  Surveys and designs for wharves, dock extensions and storage facilities will be
procured through GOI. Surveys of location for tree crops and siting of demonstration processing will be
through GOI agencies. Evaluation surveys establishing the baseline conditions, project impact, and market
conditions will be procured through Quality and Cost Based Selection or Statements of Expenditure.
Consulting Services (US$ 1.5 million). Consulting services valued at $ 1.2 million will be procured
through Quality- and Cost-Based Selection (QCBS) and directed to capacity building for project coordination,
management, monitoring and evaluation; and for engineers, community facilitators, community development
specialists and accountants associated with Community Development grants and credits.  Processing
demonstration assistance and consulting services for farming and fishing technology diffusion will be
procured through Single-Source Selection which will comprise a series of small contracts each with a value of
less than $ 100,000.
Community Participation (US$ 8.1 million). Community Development Subprojects managed by the
village councils (LKMDs) will finance the civil works, goods and services for infrastructure and income
generation activities. Procurement would be through tailored Community Participation Procedures as follows:
The LKMDs will carry out civil works by relying on direct village labor under Village Implementation
Agreements (SPPB) which would be signed between LKMDs and the Pimpro for the Component. Village
labor would be used in part for civil works helping to ensure community participation. Village labor would
be linked to specific outputs and would be specifically contracted with written records. The LKMDs would
contract for materials, rental of equipment, and small works by local contractors, following simplified
national shopping procedures, direct shopping or procedures for procurement of small works. There would be
no civil works under the subcomponent for income-generation. Goods for income generation would be
procured using direct shopping methods.
Prior Review Thresholds (Table B)
Table B of this Annex provides the thresholds for prior review. For procurement under the village
grants component, there would be prior review of the first two contracts from each kabupaten valued at
US$5,000 equivalent or more in the first and second years of project implementation. Ex-post review of
documentation on a sampling basis will cover 20 percent of the value of the village grants during PY1-2; the
percentage may be lowered to 10 percent starting PY3 depending on supervision results. This approach takes
account of the large number of very small contracts and the presence of Local Community Organizers and
project oversight and support at the kecamatan and kabupaten levels.
Prior review for selection of consultants will follow the Bank's Guidelines of January, 1997 and
revised in September, 1997. Contracts with consulting firms valued at US$ 100,000 or more and contracts
with individuals for US$ 50,000 or more, will be subject to prior review.
Contracts for goods and civil works equivalent to US$ 100,000 or more will be subject to prior
review.

Disbursement
Allocation of Loan Proceeds. The allocation of loan proceeds is shown in Table C of this Annex.
Disbursement under Community Development Subprojects.  The project will pay for goods,
equipment, works and services against measured progress and pro-rated lump-sum  contracts.  VIP
disbursement procedures will be used for infrastructure grants. Village Implementation Agreements (SPPB)
for infrastructure and income generation will be signed between the LKMD and the component's Pimpro at
the kabupaten level and certified by the Camat. Disbursements will be based on the LKMD's reports of work
progress and the use of funds, certified by the Local Community Organizers. These will be passed through
the Pimpro to the Treasury Office of the Ministry of Finance (KPKN). KPKN will transfer the funds to the
LKMD's account at the kecamatan center. Expenditures, records of paid labor, invoices and records of on-
lending for income generation will be kept at the village.
Statements of Expenditures (SOEs). Disbursements will be against Statements of Expenditure (SOEs)
for:
(1) civil works and goods valued at less than US$100,000 equivalent;
(2) contracts with individual consultants for less than US$50,000 equivalent;
(3) contracts with consulting firms for less than US$100,000 equivalent;
(4) service delivery contracts;
(5) training;
(6) research and studies; and
(7) goods, works and services under Sub-projects.
Documentation for these expenditures will be retained by the implementing agencies, and made
available to the Bank on request. All other disbursements from the loan will be fully documented.
Special Account. In order to facilitate loan disbursements, and reduce the volume of withdrawal
applications, GOI will establish a Special Account at Bank Indonesia, denominated in US dollars, with an
authorized ceiling of US$ 1.3 million covering approximately four months of disbursements. The account will
be managed by the Directorate General of Budget of the Ministry of Finance. Replenishment of the account
will be made on a monthly basis, or when 20 percent of the authorized ceiling has been disbursed, whichever
first occurs.

Annex 7
Financial Reporting and Auditing Framework
Interikal Control System
The internal control system framework for the Maluku Regional Development Project (MRDP) consists of
project management policies and procedures. It would follow the existing government internal control system,
comprising of three elements, i.e. (a) project organization (institutional framework); (b) accounting system; and (c)
control procedures, which are basically satisfactory to the Bank.
Project Organization and Staffing
Project implementation would be primarily under BAPPEDA Tk. I with a Pimpro (Project Manager) for
Component E. There would also be Pimpros for Tree Crops Development (DG Estate Crops, with a PMU); Village
Enterprises, Marketing and Processing (under KanWil PERINDAG); Technology Diffusion (BPTP, Ambon);
Fisheries Support (Dinas Peridanan Tk. I); Seed Multiplication for Irrigated Agriculture (Dinas Tanaman Pangan Tk.
I); and Sea Communication (KanWil Perhubungan). Each kabupaten would have a Pimpro for Community
Development; Animal Health, Extension and Technology Diffusion; and Project Coordination, Management, and
Monitoring/Evaluation. In addition to the Pimpros, each implementing unit or agency would have a Bendahara-wvan
(treasurer). They would have some assistance, as necessary, on procurement, technical and financial matters. The
standard requirements for a Pimpro are as follows:
The minimum requirements for a Pimpro are as follows:
*  Competence staff of the implementing agency
*  University degree (S1)
=  minimum staff level/grade IlIc for Pimpro, and IIlb for Pimbagpro
3  having a project management course certificate or equivalent
* at least two years working experience with government project
The minimum requirement for a Treasurer (Bendaharawan) are as follows:
*  Competent staff of the implementing agency
*  Three-years diploma (D3) degree
*  minimum staff level/grade IlIa
*  having a treasury (bendaharawan) course certificate or equivalent
* at least one years working experience with government project
The DG Estate Crops has experience implementing Bank projects. The project's implementing agencies
would train their staff as necessary to fulfill the requirements which should coincide with the beginning of the project.
All government implementing agencies have adequate capacity, except for BIPP for which on-the-job training would
be provided under the relevant component of the project.
Accounting System and Procedures
The general accounting system and procedures would follow the government accounting system which is in
line with the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). The existing government accounting system is
satisfactory to the Bank. In addition, the specific project accounting system and procedures would be spelled out in
the Guidelines for Project Implementation (juklak and juknis) and the Guidelines for the Implementation of Village
Grants.

Country: INDONESIA                        Project Title: MALUKU REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
The project's financial statements should show the financial position of MRDP at the end of each fiscal year,
comprising of the following:
(a)    Financial Statement of Project Account
*  Summary of funds received from the Bank and the govermernt's counterpart funds, separately;
*  Summary of expenditures shown under the project, broken down by component and expenditure category
for the current fiscal year and cumulative.
(b)    Financial Statement of Special Account and SOE
*  Deposits and replenishments to special account received from the Bank;
*  Withdrawals from the SA, including all SOEs (both from SA and other account) used as the basis for
submission of withdrawal applications;
*  Remaining balance at the end of fiscal year;
*  Reconciliation between amount received by SA and amount disbursed by the Bank.
SA/SME reports would use a format developed and conveyed to DG Budget on June 8, 1992.
Project Financial Reporting Requirements
Each implementing agency, including the LKMD, would prepare progress report, including financial report,
on quarterly basis. The reports are due for submission to the PMU or implementing agency for given components two
weeks after the end of quarter. The agencies would compile and prepare the quarterly consolidated report for
submission to Bandga, Bappenas and the Bank no later than one month after the end of quarter. The quarterly
progress reports would be used for the basis of preparing the financial statement of project account (namely SPEF) to
be submitted to the BPKP for annual audits. The financial reports (formats attached) comprise of the followings:
*  Statement of Project Expenditures and Financing (SPEF);
*  Progress Report of Project Expenditures and Financing (PRPEF);
*  Contract Expenditures Report (CONREP);
*  Non-Contracted Expenditures Report (NCONREP);
*  Project Expenditures and Financing by Location (LOCPEF) - consolidated report only;
*  Status of Loan Disbursements (STATLN) - consolidated report only;
In order to facilitate preparation of the above reports, all expenditures would be recorded in the "Worksheet for
Project Expenditures and Financing" (WSPEF).
Audit Requirements
The annual audit would be carried out by BPKP (Central Audit Board) based on the consolidated project
account submitted by the PMU. Likewise, BPKP would also audit the financial statement of Special Account and
Statement of Expenditure (SOE) prepared by DG Budget. The audits by IIPKP auditors would be in accordance with
the Terms of Reference (TOR) for the audit of project account, special account, and statement of expenditures
acceptable to the Bank. These audit reports should be submitted to the Bank each year, nine months after the end of
each fiscal year. The Terms of Reference for the audits are attached to thlis Annex. In addition to the annual audits,
the Bank would conduct ex-post reviews of all documents based on randonm sampling during supervision missions.

Country: INDONESIA                        Project Tide: MALUKU REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Flow of Funds
Annual works plan and the associated budgets from the loan and APBN would be provided to the PMU and
Bappeda Tk. I and implementing agencies through associated DIP budgets approved by MOF and Bappenas. The
activities funded by the local government funds would be provided through the APBD I and II approved by the
respective Bupatis. Pimpros would be responsible for authorizing the project expenditures in accordance with the
DIP budgets under the existing government procedures.
Pimpros would submit their payment requests for the loan and APBN funded activities to the nearby MOF
treasurers (KPKNs) who would then issue payment remittance orders to Bank Indonesia branch office to credit
suppliers/contractors accounts at their respective banks. These payments would then be telexed to Bank Indonesia
head office Jakarta to debit the project special account. For smaller amount expenditures and activities self managed
(swakeloka) by the PMU or implementing agency, a sufficient cash advance would be provided by the KPKN to the
treasurers. Each month or whenever required, the implementing agencies would have to account their expenditures
and report to the KPKNs who will replenish the agency accounts. Based on the accountability reports, the KPKN
would reimburse itself from the project special account.
DG Budget is responsible for providing the KPKNs with guidelines and criteria for eligible project
expenditures in accordance with the loan agreement. The KPKNs would be responsible to execute payments and
provide copy of the payment remittance orders (SPMs) and other supporting documents to DG Budget regularly,
against which the applications for disbursements would be prepared.
Payments against activities funded from APBD II would follow similar procedures except that request for
payments would be submitted to the District Finance Division.
Table B of Annex 3 contains details of expenditure categories by project component.
TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR THE AUDIT OF
PROJECT ACCOUNT, SPECIAL ACCOUNT and STATEMENT OF EXPENDITURES
Objective
The objective of the audit of the project financial statement is to enable the auditor to express a professional
opinion on the financial position of the Maluku Regional Development Project at the end of each fiscal year and of the
funds received and expended for a certain accounting period ended (rnmLddvyy), as reported in the financial
statements of the Project Account, Special Account and Statement of Expenditures.
The books of account provide the basis for preparation of the financial statement and are established to reflect
the financial transactions in respect of the project, as maintained by the project implementing agency, BANGDA with
the Maluku BAPPEDA Tk. I.
Scope
The audit will be carried out in accordance with the International Standard of Auditing, and will include such
tests and controls as the auditor considers necessary under the circumstances. In conducting the audit, special
attention should be paid to the following:
