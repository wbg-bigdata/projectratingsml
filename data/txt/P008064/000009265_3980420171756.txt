REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND
DEVELOPMENT TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
PENSION REFORM ADJUSTMENT LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF PERU
1.    I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to the
Republic of Peru for US$100 million to support measures deepening the reform of the
pension system and improving the efficiency of its capital market. The loan would be
payable over 17 years, on level repayments, including five years of grace, at standard
interest rate for LIBOR-based US dollars single currency loans, and would be disbursed in
a single tranche. Fifty percent of the loan amount would be set aside to finance Peru's
Debt and Debt Service Reduction (DDSR) operation with its commercial bank creditors.
The proposed Pension Reform Adjustment Loan (PRAL) would be presented to the Board
together with a free-standing DDSR loan of US$183 million.
1. MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT AND EXTERNAL FINANCING
REQUIREMENTS
Background
2.    In the three decades before 1990 the Peruvian economy moved from feast to
famine. From 1950 to 1966 when government intervention policies were limited (and
property rights were well established), per capita GDP increased at 3 percent a year,
exports increased by 8.4 percent, productivity increased at 1.7 percent, and the average
income of the poorest 40 percent of the population rose by 1.2 percent a year.
3.    Such policies were gradually abandoned, on the grounds that they did little to help
the poor. In their place came a poorly managed agrarian reform, administered prices and
overexpansion of state-owned enterprises. The results for economic growth and poverty
relief were disastrous.
4.    Policies aimed at social reform worsened and perpetuated poverty. Repeated
experiments in social engineering created economic and institutional uncertainty and a
prolonged decline in governance. That, in turn, undermined productivity, fostered anarchy
and public turmoil, and, ultimately, made poverty reduction impossible. Per capita GDP in
1967-90 declined by 0.7 percent per year, exports grew at only 1.4 percent per year,
productivity fell by 2.9 percent per year, and the average income of the poorest 40 percent
dipped by 0.1 percent per year.
5.    By 1990, per-capita income was below that of 1966; political violence was
claiming 3,000 lives each year; tax collections were less than 5 percent of GDP (in July
1990); and prices had increased by a mind-boggling factor of 27 million over three
decades. In fact, Peru's economy had all but collapsed. It was the finale on more than



2
two decades of misguided policies, economic mismanagement, and since 1980 rampant
and escalating terrorism
Economic and Public Policies After July 1990
6.    The government which came to office in July 1990 faced a country in political
disarray and an economy in tatters. It strengthened the authority of the state throughout
the countryside, defeating terrorism and fighting drug trafficking. It also implemented a
deep program of stabilization and structural reforms. The main objectives of the
stabilization-structural reform program introduced after July 1990 were to lower inflation
and transform the state-dominated economy into a market-oriented one.
7.    The stabilization program included stringent fiscal and monetary measures. A cash
management committee maintained public expenditure in line with tax collection, credit
from the Central Bank to the public sector was eliminated, the tax system was
reorganized, and public sector employment reduced.
8.    Structural reform called for liberalization at both national and sectoral levels. It
strengthened the role of market mechanisms in the allocation of resources and, implicitly,
defined a subsidiary role for the Peruvian state in the economy. From 1990 to 1994
structural reform included:
* liberalizing the interest rate and the exchange rate;
* eliminating price controls and public monopolies;
* increasing competition by opening the economy to trade with the rest of the world and
eliminating barriers to domestic trade;
* improving labor market efficiency by addressing labor tenure regulations and
establishing more flexible terms for probationary periods and fixed-term contracts;
* securing property rights facilitating private ownership of land;
* developing a vast privatization program;
* eliminating the state monopoly in social security and establishing a framework for a
private pension fund system;
* eliminating public development banks and state intervention in the allocation of credit;
* strengthening the capacity of the state as a regulator of some economic activities; and
* establishing the independence of the Central Bank.

Bank's Support of the Reform Program
9.    Peru's reform program has been supported by five IBRD adjustment operations
since 1992. A first set of three adjustment loans (Trade Reform Adjustment loan (TRAL),
Structural Adjustment Loan (SAL) and Financial Sector Adjustment Loan (FSAL)) was
approved by the Board between February and May 1992 as part of a program designed to
clear Peru's arrears with the Bank. The TRAL was approved by the Board in February
1992 and the SAL in March 1992, each of one tranche in the amount of US$300 million.
The FSAL in the amount of US$400 million was approved in May 1992. Each of these
loans underwrote the same macroeconomic stabilization program and external financing
plan, while supporting separate adjustment programs. Overall implementation was
excellent, consistent with borrower willingness and capacity to further the adjustment
process. A second set of structural adjustment loans supported privatization. A three
tranche Privatization Adjustment Loan (PAL) in the amount of US$250 million was
approved by the Board in March 1993 and a three tranche Electricity Privatization
Adjustment Loan (EPAL) for US$150 million was approved in October 1994.
10.   The TRAL supported the opening of the economy to competition with the rest of
the world. The reforms, which included reduction of tariff levels and dispersion,
elimination of non-tariff barriers, elimination of export subsidies, a scheme of drawbacks
to exporters and reform of customs, were implemented speedily and concurrent to the
stabilization program.
11.   The SAL supported reforms strengthening government effectiveness to increase
provision of key public goods, while, at the same time, reducing the scope of government
intervention in the economy to increase efficiency in the allocation of resources. The
reform program, which included reform of the tax system and tax administration, of labor
legislation and social security, elimination of domestic trade barriers and public
monopolies, liberalization of agriculture policies, and establishment of a social program
targeted to the poor, was implemented expeditiously during 1992 before the loan was
signed and became effective.
12.   The FSAL supported reforms strengthening the government's capacity to provide
a stable currency, redefining the role of the state in the financial sector from lender to
regulator and strengthening the role of the private sector in the allocation of credit. It
included closing of the development banks, strengthening banking regulation and
supervision, development of capital markets, and establishing an independent central bank.
Implementation of reform was speedy with the exception of the restructuring of Banco de
la Nacion.
13.   Two adjustment operations have supported Peru's privatization program. The
Privatization Adjustment Loan (PAL) has supported reforms promoting competition and a
privatization program focusing on mining, hydrocarbons, and telecommunications and
selected holdings in fisheries, industry, air/urban transport and the water sector.
Implementation has proceeded smoothly with the exception of the fishery sector, where
key regulatory decisions are still pending, and of hydrocarbons, where the privatization of



4
Petroperu did not begin in earnest until early 1996. Thus, while privatization continues to
move forward, the third tranche of this loan is still pending. The Electricity Privatization
Adjustment Loan (EPAL) has supported regulatory reforms to promote competition and
privatization in the electricity sector. Implementation has proceeded smoothly to date and
the second tranche of this loan is still pending.
14.   The Bank adjustment support strategy has been highly successful: it has
contributed to the direction of the reforms and has supported a well defined strategy to
reintegrate Peru into the international financial community. A key element in this success
has been the sense of clear government 'ownership' of the program--which is best
exemplified by the implementation of the vast majority of the conditions in the first three
adjustment loans even before the approval of these loans.
The Results of the Reform Program: 1990-1995
1S.   Fiscal and monetary discipline together with structural reform, public order, and
targeted programs to alleviate the condition of the poor had remarkable results from 1990
to 1995: the economy greatly improved (see Table I for some indicators), terrorism was
defeated and the percentage of families below the poverty line decreased by 10 percent.
There was steady decline in inflation and unbroken fiscal discipline, and Peru moved from
virtual international isolation to become one of the most attractive emerging markets in the
region. Higher confidence resulted in a large inflow of capital which boosted aggregate
demand and economic growth. Productivity increased steadily and so did per capita
income and consumption levels, especially in isolated regions and for the poor who had
suffered the most from ten years of terrorism and devastation.

3/ Tax collection evolved from 9% in 1991 to 11.1% in 1994 and 11.6% in 1995.
16.   Fiscal and Monetary Discipline and Price Stabilization The rate of inflation
fell steadily since 1990 as a result of stringent fiscal and monetary measures. The
elimination of credit from the Central Bank to the system of development banks drastically
reduced the rate of monetary expansion and inflation plummeted from 7,649 percent in



5
1990 to 139 percent in 1991 and declined steadily to 15 percent in 1994 and 10 percent in
1995. It is expected to hold at about 11.5 percent in 1996.
17.   Monetary policy pursued price stability and encouraged a remonetization of the
economy. Monetary expansion has been the result of purchases of foreign exchange.
Open market operations, conducted through the purchase and sale of Central Bank
(BCRP) short-term debt, have been used to smooth the impact of purchases of foreign
exchange on the money supply. These policies have resulted in a rapid monetization of the
economy--both in soles and dollars--and a steady increase in Central Bank (BCRP) and
Banco de la Nacion's (BN) international reserves.
18.   Peru's foreign reserve position has strengthened considerably, which is good given
the high level of dollarization of the economy and complete openness to international
capital flows. International reserves rose by US$2,307 million between 1990 and 1993,
US$3,564 million in 1994 (boosted by US$2,217 from privatization) and US$1,116
million in 1995. The stock of foreign BCRP-BN reserves (US$9,805 million as of August
1996) includes US$3,219 million of commercial bank reserve requirement deposits and
about US$3,435 million of Treasury privatization receipts. At US$6.6 billion the foreign
exchange reserves net of commercial bank reserve requirements were enough to back 55
percent of the monetary liabilities of the banking system in August 1996 and, net of
commercial bank reserve requirement deposits and Treasury privatization deposits,
represented about 5 months of imports.
19.   Fiscal policy has been tight with public sector spending in line with tax collection
and the fiscal deficit entirely financed through external credit. Public sector spending was
drastically reduced at the beginning of the stabilization program, but most of the savings
were brought about through the elimination of credit subsidies and cuts in the deficit of
state owned enterprises and therefore did not result in a drop in production of public
goods. The combined public sector deficit (before privatization proceeds) fell from 7.6
percent of GDP in 1990 to about 2.7 percent of GDP in 1991-94--it was 2.6 percent in
1995 and has been fully financed since 1991 by external funds. Privatization receipts have
been large since 1993--they were 0.3 percent of GDP in 1993, 4.5 percent in 1994 and 1.5
percent in 1995. Most of these proceeds have been kept as foreign exchange reserves at
the Central Bank. During 1992-95 Peru fully complied with the performance criteria
agreed with the IMF under a three-year EFF program. In July 1996 the IMF Board
approved a new extended arrangement in the amount of SDR 248.3 million for 1996-98.
20.   The government has taken decisive steps towards reintegrating Peru in the
international financial market. Peru cleared its arrears with the IDB in 1991 and with the
EMF and the World Bank in 1993, rescheduled its obligations with the Paris Club in 1991,
1993 and 1996, and is expected to close by December 1996 a debt and debt service
reduction (DDSR) operation with its commercial bank creditors. The 1996 Paris Club
agreement provides debt relief for 1996-98 and reprofiled maturities falling due from
January 1999 on, corresponding to debts previously rescheduled under the Paris Club of
1991. The agreement was conceived as an exit from the rescheduling process for Peru,
and it broke new ground in Paris Club treatment of country payment difficulties in a



6
medium term context as a result of previous reschedulings. The DDSR operation with the
commercial banks (described in detail in the accompanying documentation for the DDSR
loan) encompasses about US$7.9 billion of medium-term commercial debt.
21.   Capital Inflows and Economic Growth. While Peru's formal reintegration into
the international capital market has taken several years, firm steps to reform the economy
had an immediate impact on international capital flows and Peru moved from net exporter
of capital to net recipient of significant capital inflows both long and short term. Short-
term capital inflows (including errors and omissions) during 1991-95 were over US$5.7
billion, or about US$1.2 billion a year. Long-term capital inflows were about US$6.7
billion, with a big increase in 1994, mainly due to exceptional proceeds from privatization.
Taken together, the long and short term (net) capital inflows average US$2.5 billion a
year-- about 5 percent of the GDP.
22.   While domestic savings have increased significantly since 1990, capital inflows
have become a critical source of financing the rapid increase in investment. Domestic
savings increased from 12.3 percent of GDP in 1990 to 16.5 percent in 1995 but the
investment to GDP ratio increased by 8.5 percentage points--reaching 24.2 percent of
GDP in 1995, up from the 15.7 percent of 1990. Further efforts at increasing domestic
savings are required to finance a sustained increase in investment over the next decade.
23.   High capital inflows boosted aggregate demand and a sustained economic recovery
started in the second half of 1992. In 1993 GDP went up 6.4 percent while aggregate
demand increased by 6 percent (investment up 13.4 percent and consumption up 3.7
percent), and exports increased by 3.3 percent. In 1994 recovery took a faster pace (GDP
up 13.1 percent) boosted by a 14.9 percent increase in aggregate demand (investment up
30 percent, consumption up 9.6 percent) and a 17.5 percent increase in exports. As a
result by the end of 1994 the economy was operating close to full capacity.
24.   In 1995 aggregate demand continued increasing, boosted by rapid credit expansion
to the private sector and an increase in public spending during the election campaign and
war with Ecuador. As the economy reached full capacity (in the first months of 1995),
economic growth slowed down considerably (year average of 7 percent) and the deficit in
the current account of the balance of payments widened from 5.1 percent of GDP in 1994
to 7.2 percent in 1995--with 40 percent of the imbalance financed by short term capital
inflows. The rapid fall in public spending in the second-half of 1995 and strict fiscal
discipline in the first-half of 1996 (primary surplus up one percent of GDP compared to
the same period of 1995) has conveyed a message of restraint to the private sector. As a
result, in the first quarter of 1996, aggregate demand fell 3.9 percent (compared to the
same period of 1995), the current account deficit narrowed to about 6 percent of GDP,
and the rate of growth of GDP fell to 1.9 percent in the first nine months of 1996
(compared to the same period of 1995).
25.   External Trade and the Real Exchange Rate. The exchange rate has been
floating with limited intervention by the central bank. The exchange rate had a rapid
appreciation in the second-half of 1990 following the beginning of the stabilization



7
program. From that period it remained (with fluctuations) at a stable level until 1995
when there was a further 5 percent real appreciation. The real appreciation, particularly
since 1993, must have been of some significance for both export and import performance
during the period.
26.   From 1990 to 1995, aggregate exports increased by 67.9 percent in current dollar
terms while imports increased 163.1 percent. Exports as a percentage of GDP fell from
10.4 percent to 9.5 percent in 1995 while imports increased from 9.2 percent to 13.1
percent in 1995. Among exports, non-traditional exports increased during the period 45.4
percent and traditional exports increased 76.2 percent. Within the non-traditional sector,
exports of agro-processing products increased 130 percent from 1990 to 1995 whereas
exports of manufacturing sector (half of which are textiles) increased 23.3 percent. It is
possible that for manufactures (in which the domestic and foreign markets are closer
substitutes) exports are more affected by the exchange rate and by anti-export bias. The
lack of a significant emergence of manufactured product exports is likely an important
element today which makes manufacturers in Peru the strongest protagonist for the re-
introduction of substantial protection. Insofar as sustainability of the low tariff dispersion
trade policy is not entirely secure, the threat to it comes primarily from this source.
27.   Income and Consumption Increases and Poverty Reduction. In 1990-95, per
capita income grew 3.6 percent a year and the percentage of the population below the
poverty line fell from 55 to 50 percent (see Table 2). Thus, the poverty situation in Peru,

although still serious, has improved greatly. Higher productivity and the creation of more
jobs and higher earnings, greatly increased per capita consumption spending, especially for
people in areas devastated by a decade of terrorism and isolation. Less developed areas
have fared better than Lima, and the lowest income ranges, better than the average. The
32 percent consumption increase of the lowest quintile surpassed the average of 29
percent. And the biggest increase in expenditure per capita from 1991 to 1994 were in the
urban areas of the Coast and the Sierra.
Peru's Economic Outlook
28.   Short-Term Macroeconomic Outlook. Economic growth is estimated at about
2-3 percent in 1996 and 4-5 percent in 1997--lower than in 1994-1995 as a result of
capacity constraints and a slowdown in the rate of growth of aggregate demand. In spite
of rapidly growing investment, economic growth in mining and tourism will be affected by
the low levels of investment in the past decade, in fisheries because of natural resource
constraints. In the manufacturing industry increasing competition from imports will make
economically obsolete part of the import substitution industry and lower growth of
aggregate demand will further squeeze its market share. At the same time, growth of
export oriented activities will be adversely affected by the ambiguities of trade policy and
high implicit taxation faced by these activities. The rate of growth of spending in consumer
durables and residential construction are projected to fall as more realistic projections
about the pace of future economic growth substitute the bullish views of 1994-1995 and
previous pent-up demand has been satisfied.
29.   Peru's deficit in current account of the balance of payments is expected to fall to
about 5-6 percent of GDP in 1996-1998 as a result of a slowdown in absorption. The
three year EFF program approved by the IMF Board in July 1996 is an important step
towards renewed fiscal effort and a reduction of the deficit in the current account of the
balance of payments. It aims to reduce inflation from 10 percent in 1995 to industrialized
country levels in 1998 and to reduce the combined public sector deficit from 2.5 percent in
1995 to about equilibrium in 1998, the result of a decline in interest spending following the
closing of the DDSR and a strong increase in the Central Government primary surplus.
30.   Medium-Term Debt and Financing Outlook. In the absence of corrective
measures public debt service would have increased significantly at the beginning of the
next decade as a result of payments due on the external debt and of growing social
security spending. To meet these financing demands Peru has to design and implement
policy measures reducing the burden of this service and encouraging higher domestic
savings. On the external debt front the recent rescheduling of Paris Club obligations and
the planned closing of a DDSR agreement with the commercial banks are important steps
to reduce the debt overhang and smooth the flow of debt service in the next decade. A
similar approach has been followed on the domestic debt front by way of repackaging
contingent pension liabilities into new pension debt and establishing a Pension Trust Fund



9
(FCRP) which will be used in due time to redeem the pension obligations. Allocating the
bulk of the privatization proceeds to finance the FCRP would be critical to strengthen the
medium-term fiscal outlook.
31.   External public debt and debt service due will drop in 1997-2000 as a result of the
DDSR agreement between the GOP and the commercial banks. While Peru will remain
not only a highly indebted country but also one with a more inflexible external debt
structure, the Government's ability to service its remaining debt would strengthen as
reforms take hold and the economy improves, thereby lowering the scheduled debt service
ratio from 37 percent of total exports in 1995 to a projected ratio of about 21 percent in
2000 and lowering the debt/GDP ratio from about 54 percent in 1995 to about 38 percent
in 2000.
32.   Should Peru stay the course, complete the reform of its pension system and
continue opening the economy to the rest of the world, its external financing outlook is
strong. The current account deficit is estimated to fall from 7.2 percent in 1995 to about 5
percent in 1998 and to about 3 percent in 2000 (see Annex 4). Staying the course would
gradually reduce Peru's perceived country risk, attract new investment and broaden access
to long-term external financing. Implementing the reform of the pension system would
result in domestic debt and debt service reduction, while, at the same time, it would
encourage higher domestic savings. Further opening the economy to trade with the rest of
the world would ensure that the build up of Peru's capital stock would take place in a low-
distortion environment and hence the capacity to repay currently incurred obligations
would increase.
HI. THE GOVERNMENT'S ONGOING ADJUSTMENT PROGRAM
Objectives
33.   The Government's structural reform program for 1996-98, described in detail in
the Letter of Development Policy (see Annex 1), aims to consolidate a dynamic market
economy, one that creates new jobs and supports sustained increases in productivity. The
program intends to lower inflation to about 4 percent by 1998, sustain 5-6 percent annual
economic growth, reduce extreme poverty by 50 percent by the year 2000 and consolidate
external viability (as stated in the Letter of Intent to the IMF requesting an extended
arrangement).
34.   The program addresses the main issues pending in Peru's reform agenda. First, it
includes a macroeconomic program to maintain price stability and complete Peru's
integration into the international financial market. Secondly, it includes reforms directed
to consolidate a dynamic market economy with measures: (i) establishing a labor market
regime that contributes to create new jobs in the formal sector, (ii) reducing tariff levels
and tariff dispersion, (iii) completing the privatization program, (iv) creating an inviting
environment for investment in areas where the reform process has proceeded at a slower
pace (agriculture and infrastructure), and (v) improving the efficiency of programs



10
targeted to the poor and providing secure property rights to the poor. Thirdly, it includes
a program to increase domestic savings and strengthen the medium-term fiscal outlook by
way of deepening the reform of the pension system and allocating part of the large
receipts from privatization to back pension obligations. Fourthly, it includes
complementary capital market reforms.
The Macroeconomic Program
35.   Objectives. The Government's macroeconomic program aims to lower inflation,
continue Peru's reintegration into the international financial community and maintain a
viable external financing program. The Government is committed to: (i) increase the
primary surplus from 0.3 percent of GDP in 1995 to one percent in 1996 and 2 percent in
1998; (ii) maintain a monetary policy so as to reduce inflation to industrialized country
levels in 1998; and (iii) pursue a flexible exchange rate policy with central bank
interventions aimed only at smoothing out temporary fluctuations of the exchange rate.
The targets are consistent with those of the EFF program.
36.   The program aims to reduce the current account deficit and reliance on short-term
capital inflow financing. It projects an increase in the ratio of investment to GDP from
24.2 percent in 1995 to 25.5 percent in 1998, which is more than offset by the projected
increase in domestic savings from 16.5 percent of GDP in 1995 to 20.5 percent in 1998--
thus, a reduction of the deficit in the current account to 5 percent by 1998. To that end
the Government will not only continue to encourage higher domestic savings (through
deepening the pension reform and increasing capital market efficiency) but also will
increase the nonfinancial public sector balance (before privatization receipts) from a 2.6
percent deficit in 1995 to about equilibrium by 1998. By completing its DDSR agreement
with the commercial banks and continuing negotiations with other creditors, the
Government projects larger access to long-term financing.
The Reforms to Consolidate a Dynamic Market Economy
37.   Objectives. Peru is entering a second stage of reform. The challenge at this new
stage is to consolidate a dynamic market economy, one that creates new jobs in the formal
sector and supports sustained increases in productivity and poverty reduction. This
requires improving the efficiency of the economy, creating an inviting environment for new
private investment, and pursuing efficient poverty alleviation programs.
38.   To improve the efficiency of the economy. The Government has modernized
labor legislation and will (i) continue opening the economy to competition with the rest of
the world, and (ii) complete the privatization program. Law 26513 of July 1995 and
Legislative Decree (DL) 855 of September 1996, continued the process launched in 1991
with DL 728 making the labor market more flexible and thus facilitating the creation of
jobs in the formal sector. These measures will contribute to strengthening an inviting
environment for investment in the manufacturing industry and services. To increase
competition with the rest of the world the Government will further reduce average tariffs
and tariff dispersion which will contribute to create new jobs and attract investment to



11
areas where Peru has comparative advantages. 4 To consolidate the subsidiary role of the
state in the economy the Government will also continue with the privatization of
Petroperu, Centromin and remaining state-owned electricitv companies.
39.   To invite new private investment in agriculture and infrastructure. New
investments in agriculture and basic infrastructure are critical to reach Peru's medium-term
economic growth and poverty reduction objectives; even so, private sector investment in
these activities has proceeded at a slow pace. Because of security problems and weak
property rights, modernization of agriculture has lagged behind that in other sectors of the
economy. To encourage private investment in agriculture Law 26505 of July 1995 raises
limits on private land ownership in the agricultural sector and DL 807 of April 1996
allows the transformation of sugar cooperatives into corporate businesses. In the future
the Government intends to (i) accelerate the registration of titles on agricultural land, and
to (ii) promote a more efficient use of water resources through a new water law. To
promote private investment in infrastructure DL 839 of August 1996, a new concessions
law, allows private participation through long-term concessions in the provision of most
public infrastructure services.
40.   To alleviate poverty. While the Government's poverty reduction strategy has
been based on reestablishing public order, price stability and free market policies, it has
also successfully used targeted programs to alleviate the condition of the poor and
extreme poor, has launched a program to secure the property rights of the poor, and
continues to improve education and health services. Targeted social programs, as the
Fondo Nacional de Compensacion y Desarrollo Social (National Fund for Social
Compensation and Development (FONCODES)), which implemented more than 20,160
projects for US$766 million in social infrastructure between 1992 and 1996, will continue
playing an important role, using a revised poverty map which improves the capacity to
reach the extreme poor. Also, the Government has launched an ambitious plan to provide
registered titles to urban property which will facilitate the use of these titles as collateral
and will broaden access to the formal financial market to the poor.
The Pension Reform Program
Background
41.   There are two publicly sponsored pension systems: the Sistema Nacional de
Pensiones--National Pension System (SNP)-- and the Cedula Viva System--Pension
System for State Employees (CV). The SNP, a 'pay as you go', defined benefit system,
was created by Law 19990 in 1973 through the consolidation of a number of separate
retirement programs. While intending to cover all Peruvian workers (except for those
under the CV system or the armed forces pension system), the SNP never reached more

25 percent.



12
than 50 percent of the labor force and, as of 1990, it only collected contributions from 50
percent of its affiliates and ran a high deficit.
42.   The CV system, a defined benefit regime, had its origin in the civil servant pension
system of the 19th century. Law 20530 of 1974 intended to close the CV system,
establishing a self-phasing out mechanism by limiting eligibility to benefits to workers who
entered the civil service before 1962. However, the coverage of the system was extended
considerably during the 1980s; thus, instead of being gradually phased out, the system
grew explosively. This was the result of (i) laws which extended coverage to new groups
of public employees, and (ii) legally questionable incorporations made possible, in part, by
administrative disorder and corruption.
43.   From 1985 to 1990 four laws modified Law 20530 and extended the closing date
for the CV regime from 1962 to 1980. Law 24366 of 1985 extended eligibility to benefits
to workers who had been in the civil service for more than 7 years as of 1974, thus
moving the closing date for the CV from 1962 to 1967. Law 25066 of 1989 extended
eligibility to benefits to workers who had joined the civil service before 1974, even if they
were as of 1989 working under private sector law. This moved the closing date for the
CV from 1967 to 1974. DL 556 of 1989 extended eligibility to benefits to workers in all
agencies included in the public sector budget, thus establishing grounds for claims to
benefits from groups of workers in state owned enterprises. And Law 25212 of 1990
extended eligibility to benefits to workers in the education sector who had joined the civil
service before 1980.
44.   During the late 1980s, the chaotic state of the public administration facilitated the
passage of many legally questionable claims to CV benefits. It is presumed that benefits
were granted, in many cases, based on fraudulent documentation. *And many workers in
state owned enterprises became eligible to CV benefits in a manner presumably
inconsistent with Law 20530--which prohibits the accumulation of years of service in the
private and public sectors.5
45.   Because benefits are very generous and contribution rates are low the CV system
is very costly. Female (male) workers are entitled to CV benefits after 12 (15) years of
service. And time spent while working for a university degree can be counted as years of
service (Law 24156 of 1985). Benefits for male (female) workers are set at 1/30 (1/24) of
the average salary during the last year of service. Thus the replacement rate varies
between 50 percent, when the worker has been in service for 15 years, and 100 percent
when the worker has been in service for 30 years. Survivor's benefits set by Law 25048
of 1988 at 100 percent of CV pensions are also extremely generous. Contribution rates
vary from 8 percent to 15 percent.
Under Peruvian law workers in state owned enterprises have always been under private labor law.



13
The first stage of the reform of the pension system
46.   Law 25897 of 1992, authorized a system of private pension funds (AFPs) as an
alternative to the 'pay as you go' national pension system (SNP). The new regime (SPP)
permitted Peruvians to open individual retirement accounts in AFPs, receiving partial
credit for previous contributions to the SNP through a bond--'Bono de Reconocimiento'
(BR) 6 While Law 25897 was an essential first step in that it launched a frilly financed
pension system, it (i) maintained both different contribution rates and ditferent retirement
ages for the SNP and the SPP, (ii) did not allow the transfer to the SPP of public
employees covered by Peru's oldest and most expensive, defined benefit system, 'Cedula
Viva' (CV), and (iii) did not close entry to the SNP regime to new entrants to the formal
labor force.
The second stage of the reform of the pension system
47.   The first step. Law 26504 of July 1995 eliminated differences in contribution
rates and retirement ages between the SNP and the SPP (Table 3 presents contribution
rates before and after the reform). These measures brought about a significant increase in

8   The contribution rate will be increased to 10 percent in December 1996 (Law 26504).

transfers from the SNP to the SPP after July 1995 and reduced, through the increase in
retirement age, the contingent pension obligations of the SNP.
48.   The elimination of differences in contribution rates has been critical to continue
shrinking the SNP. The difference in contribution rates is the most important factor in
determining the decision of a young worker to join the SNP or the SPP and the only factor
that may incline a new entrant to the labor force to prefer the SNP--and the phase out of
the SNP depends on few or no new affiliations of young workers. Thus, maintaining a
contribution rate to the SNP higher than or equal to that to the SPP is likely to result in a
gradual phase out of the 'pay as you go'.
49.   The second step. DL 817 of July 1996 (i) unambiguously established the right of
public employees to transfer from the CV to the SPP; (ii) gave authority to the National
Pension Office (ONP) to audit all claims for benefits to the CV regime to determine their
legitimacy; (iii) required the ONP to periodically estimate the actuarial cost of the pension
obligations under the SNP and CV regimes and from the issue of BRs; (iv) instituted the
pension trust fund--Fondo Consolidado de Reservas Previsionales (FCRP)--to back
pension obligations; (v) established that adjustments of pensions of employees of formerly
owned state enterprises will be subject to the same limitations as SNP pensions; (vi)
instituted incentives for migration from the CV regime to the SPP; (vii) established a
ceiling for CV pensions--at the level of remuneration of a member of Congress. Thus DL
817 significantly reduced the future impact of the CV regime on the Treasury's coffers,
established grounds for an accounting system that quantifies and recognizes contingent
pension obligations, and created the legal basis for a pension trust fund to back these
obligations.
50.   The public pension systems as of September 1996. Peru's pension system is in
a transition stage where a fully funded regime covering about 1,400,000 employees
coexists with (i) a 'pay-as-you-go' regime covering about 980,000 active and about
320,000 retired employees and (ii) a privileged defined benefit regime which covers about
50,000 active and 250,000 retired civil servants and employees of former state owned
enterprises. At about one million, the number of workers affiliated to the unfunded
publicly sponsored pension regimes is still high and so are the state contingent pension
liabilities. At the same time, operating costs of the private pension system's AFP's are
high, and their investment opportunities in Peru's capital markets are still limited.
51.   During 1996, the annual expenses of the SNP (about US$394 million equivalent)
are largely covered by revenue from contributions and other assets (about US$288 million
equivalent). The deficit, estimated by the ONP at about US$106 million equivalent, is
expected to widen to about US$207 million equivalent in 1997, and to increase steadily in
the next 10 years as a result of a drop in revenue contributions. The annual expenditure of
the Treasury in CV pensions is about US$400 million. The current cost of CV pensions
financed directly by state owned enterprises, local governments, and/or agencies outside
the Central Government is not known yet.



15
52.   The net present value of pension obligations exceeds US$15 billion. There are
explicit pension obligations--BRs issued to those who transferred from the SNP to the
SPP-- and contingent pension obligations--those who result from the ONP obligation to
pay future pensions to those under the SNP and the CV systems. The present value of
BRs already issued is about US$137 million. The present value of pension liabilities under
the SNP (net of contributions) was, as of September 1996, about US$10-14 billion--this is
the cost the Government would have to finance in the absence of any new reform. The
present value of pension liabilities under the CV system was, as of December 1995, about
US$5-7 billion.
53.   Thus, Peru's public pension systems (SNP and CV) are bankrupt on an actuarial
basis. They demand payments from the State that cannot be met now and which are
projected to increase exponentially during the next 20 years. The 'Cedula Viva' system is
particularly costly because it requires increases in pensions to meet salary increases,
because it has been carelessly administered to permit unauthorized expansion of the
system, and because many pensions are excessively large.
54.   The private pension system as of September 1996. The private pension fund
(AFPs) portfolio has grown fast to about US$1 billion equivalent, but there is little
product diversity and intermediation costs are high. The pension fund regulatory regime
does not encourage an efficient intermediation of funds. The situation of the AFP industry
shows remarkable similarity in aggregate portfolio composition (shares invested in stocks,
bonds, bank CDs etc.) as well as individual stock holdings. In addition, at two percent of
salaries, the commissions charged for managing the accounts are high compared to similar
systems in other countries.
55.   Lack of product diversity is due to a regulatory regime which penalizes deviations
from the current market average. Thus, it encourages each AFP to invest in the same
portfolio or a portfolio highly correlated with the AFP current average. At the same time,
it does not discourage taking high risk (which is associated with high return) and actually
contributes to systemic risk by inducing an overconcentration in a limited set of assets.
The result of these perverse incentives was that the AFPs were encouraged to invest in
sol-denominated CDs and Central Bank paper (which have a higher short term yield but a
lower-compound long-term yield and also high risk) rather than in long-term and foreign
currency denominated instruments.
56.   The third step. The reforms of November 1996 aim to: (i) continue shrinking the
SNP, (ii) strengthen the medium-term fiscal outlook by making substantial deposits into
the pension trust fund to finance the state contingent and explicit pension liabilities, and
(iii) strengthen the private system.
57.   To continue shrinking the SNP. DL 874 of November 1996 extends until
December 1997 the current structure of contribution rates to the SNP and SPP. In
addition DL 874 eases the eligibility criteria to apply for a BR. Under the new law, all
new applicants who have contributed to the SNP for 48 months within the 10 years before

December, 1996, will be able to receive a BR.lo Other things equal, the higher the credit a
worker receives for its past contributions, the more likely it is she (he) will transfer to the
SPP. Thus, this will help to attract young workers still affiliated to the SNP in the 25-31
age cohort --there are still about 134,000 affiliates in this age cohort. Most of these
workers did not qualify to receive the BR set by Law 25897 but will be eligible to receive
a BR under DL 874 of November 1996.
58.   To strengthen the medium-term fiscal outlook. The Government will enact in
November, 1996 the regulatory regime for the pension trust fund (FCRP), and will by
December 10, 1996 deposit into the FCRP account US$1 billion from the proceeds from
privatization to back pension obligations. The DS establishing the regulatory regime for
the FCRP will allow the FCRP: (i) to invest funds in the domestic market or abroad, and
(ii) to subcontract one or more administrators to manage the FCRP investment portfolio.
It also establishes (iii) that no more than 5 percent of the funds can be invested in public
sector debt, and (iv) the obligation to report periodically the FCRP investment portfolio
performance.
59.   To strengthen the private sector pension system. DL 874 of November 1996
takes some significant initial steps to discourage high fees and increase competition of
AFPs. It eliminates the use of a benchmark rate of return for the industry and of 'bands'
around this rate of return, thus increasing the benefits achievable by AFPs for relative
overperformance, and reducing the penalties for relative underperformance. It also
requires that investment results be reported on a regular basis net of fees, and expands the
categories of securities in which AFPs can invest.
60.   T'hese reforms will encourage: (i) competition among the AFPs to offer a broader
range of portfolio options--inducing an allocation of savings as close as possible to the
true preferences and interests of savers; (ii) longer term investment, particularly in
securitized mortgage obligations; (iii) reduced investment in short term bank obligations;
and (iv) more investment in foreign markets. The changes in the regulatory regime will
make the AFPs better able to provide long term financing for the Peruvian economy while
removing disincentives to prudent and diversified investment.
61.   The costs and benefits of the reform. The costs to the Treasury as a result of
the issue of the BR set by DL 874 arise from the possible loss of contributions and from
the issue of the BRs. The benefits are the savings resulting from not paying at retirement
the SNP pensions to those who transfer, If as a result of the reform about 133,000 SNP
young affiliates in the 25-31 years old cohort move to the SPP, the Treasury would have
to issue BRs for a nominal value of US$247 million equivalent (net present value of about
US$13 million equivalent). In addition, the Treasury would lose annually contributions
for about US$31 million equivalent. The net present value of the costs resulting from
losses in contributions and issue new BRs is US$844 million. The net present value of the
10  Aninex 3 presents tise methodology to estimate the value of the BRs.



17
benefits is US$2,117.11 The centralization of all claims to CV benefits at the ONP would
be the first step to gauge the cost reducing impact of DL 817.
Future steps
62.   The next stage in the reform of the pension system will include measures (i) to
strengthen the quality of the regulatory regime for pension funds, (ii) to establish a unified
framework for pension asset and liability management including the use of government
extraordinary revenues and (iii) to continue reducing the debt and debt service resulting
from publicly sponsored pension programs--see Matrix of Policy Actions (Annex 2).
63.   To improve the efficiency of financial intermediation of the AFPs, the Government
will enact during the first-half of 1997 a new regulatory framework to encourage the offer
of a diversified range of financial products and a more transparent disclosure of risk and
will review the present regulatory structure to explore possible reductions in complexity
and cost.
64.   To introduce more transparency as to the financial situation of the publicly
sponsored pension regimes as well as to the fiscal outlook, the Government will issue, in
the first-half of 1997, budgetary rules consistent with the accounting of the accrued costs
of the contingent pension obligations. These rules will determine mechanisms to reduce
the difference between the pension obligations and the value of assets of the FCRP
through the transfer of ordinary and extraordinary revenue from the Treasury to the
FCRP.
65.   To encourage migration of workers with legitimate claims to CV benefits to the
SPP, the Government will issue the necessary regulation so as to implement the incentive
schemes introduced in DL 817 and will complete the audit of claims to benefits during
1997.
66.   To define future steps in pension reform the Govermment will prepare during the
first half of 1997 a study analyzing the state of the SNP. This study will address the costs
of the SNP. In particular, it will compare the alternative of a gradual phase out of the
SNP with that of transforming the SNP into a fully financed pension regime. Following
the recommendations of the study the Government will design and implement the
necessary changes in the pension regulatory framework during the second-half of 1997.
Complementary Capital Market Reforms
67.   Background. The improvements in the economy after 1990 and the modernization
of the capital market regulatory regime after 1992 have resulted in a significant increase in
the capacity of Peru's capital market to intermediate funds. As a result, stock market
capitalization increased from US$1,124 million in 1992 to US$15,221 million in 1996, the
The discount rate is 6 percent.



18
value of bond and short-term commercial paper financing went up from US$125 million
in 1992 to US$435 million in 1995, and foreign portfolio investment increased from
US$27 million in 1992 to US$1,875 million in 1995. The expansion of the private
pension funds--with assets valued at US$1 billion as of October 1996--contributed
significantly to these results.
68.   The reforms of 1992 enacted in DL 755, the capital markets law, helped start or
increased use of new financial institutions and instruments (such as mutual funds, ADRs,
and corporate bonds) and improved regulatory oversight and trading and information
systems.
69.   Notwithstanding these improvements Peru's capital market is small and there is
need to expand the range of financial instruments available (especially for institutional
investors). First, the stock market is almost entirely devoted to trading in shares issued
prior to 1990, most of them, by the Velazco Government fiat shares issued to labor. Few
companies have sold shares in the market to increase their capital (mostly in connection
with mergers and reorganizations) and none has made an initial public stock offering over
the past five years. Secondly, there have been increasing public issuances of corporate
bonds but most of the financing of business start-ups, expansions, and operations (not
including privatizations and foreign direct investment) has been provided by bank short
term loans. Thirdly, the development of an individual account pension system has not had
a significant impact in the supply of medium-and long-term financial instruments. In fact,
the bulk of the AFPs investment portfolio has been concentrated in short term sol-
denominated deposits in banks or short term paper of the BCRP.
70.   To address these issues it has been necessary to modify the regulatory regime (i) to
incorporate the use of new financial instruments into Peru's capital market, (ii) to improve
the regulatory environment and (iii) to expand the range of instruments available for
investment of institutional investors such as the AFPs.
71.   The reforms of October 1996. Legislative Decrees 861 and 862 of October 1996
introduce these improvements in capital market regulation. They (i) establish a framework
for the operation of investment funds; (ii) provide a solid base for securitization of
otherwise illiquid financial assets such as mortgage loans and consumer credit receivables;
(iii) simplify the regulation of mutual funds; (iv) improve regulation pertaining to short
term paper and convertible bonds; (v) increase capital requirements for financial
intermediates; (vi) introduce the concept of self-regulation of the stock market; (vii)
establish the independence of the agent in charge of the clearing and liquidation of
financial transactions in the stock market; and (viii) improve market transparency. It is
expected that experience with the mechanisms introduced by DL 861 and DL 862 will
require further adjustments and refinements in order to more fully implement the concept
of an essentially self-regulating market and limited government involvement (see Annexes
I and 2).

HI. BANK ASSISTANCE STRATEGY
Overall Assistance Strategy
72.   Since August 1990, the Bank has assisted the Government in preparing and
implementing its reform program. The Bank has extended US$1.4 billion in five
adjustment operations since 1992, as well as US$947.2 million in complementary
investment and technical assistance projects. The objectives set by the 1994 Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS) discussed by the Board on November 22, 1994, were to help:
(i) sustain and accelerate the stabilization and adjustment processes; (ii) foster private
sector development and public sector reform; (iii) rehabilitate key infrastructure; and (iv)
alleviate poverty and promote human resource development. Bank lending was forecast at
about US$500 million p.a. for FY94-96. While the 1994 CAS acknowledged the
declining importance of structural adjustment operations in following years and the
increasing importance of investment projects, it also contemplated preparation of a
possible structural adjustment and/or a DDSR operation to support the consolidation of
the reform program and a possible DDSR agreement with the commercial banks. The
proposed loan would assist directly in the achievement of the first two objectives set by
the CAS and complement the Bank's poverty-focused lending program which includes
targeted investment programs for health, nutrition and primary education, a social
investment fund and investment in basic infrastructure for the poor such as rural roads,
water and sanitation.
73.   Under the proposed lending program, which assumes sustained stabilization and
structural reform, Bank exposure during 1996-2000 is projected to increase from US$1.7
billion to US$2.8 billion. Exposure ratios are expected to remain within Bank norms
during this period. Debt service to preferred creditors is expected to rise gradually to 33.6
percent of total public debt service by 2000, due largely to substantial disbursements from
preferred creditors. IBRD's share is projected to increase from 8.1 percent of total public
debt service in 1995 to 16.3 percent by 2000, and debt service to IBRD as a share of
export of goods and non-factor services earnings is expected to increase from 3 to 4
percent over the same period. These projections are conditioned on sustained progress
by the Government in implementing its reform program. Inadequate macroeconomic
progress or major policy reversals could trigger a substantial reduction in the lending
program, with correspondingly less exposure but higher risk for the Bank.
IFC
74.    Since 1992, IFC has committed US$46.2 million in loans, US$24.7 million in
equity and US$6.2 million in quasi-equity in companies mainly in the financial services
and non-ferrous mining sectors. With the recent investments in the banking sector,
financial services have replaced mining as the principal area of IFC investment. IFC has
been an active partner in Peru's privatization process through its commitment of US$20
million to the Peru Privatization Fund which helps swap sovereign Peruvian debt for
equity in newly privatized companies. The Fund made, for example, investments in



20
Edelsur, the recently privatized electricity distribution company for southern Lima. IFC
has also played a significant role in promoting Peru's private pension system by taking a
US$1.1 million equity stake in AFP Horizonte, one of Peru's largest pension funds.
Coordination with the IMF and the IDB
75.   The Bank has worked closely with the IMF and the IDB in the design and
supervision of adjustment operations in Peru, in formulating country strategy, and in
economic and sector work. The three-year extended arrangement between Peru and the
IMF expired in March, 1996 during which all performance criteria were observed. A new
three-year extended arrangement was approved by the IME Board in July 1996 for an
amount of SDR 248.3 million. The Bank has also maintained a close relationship with the
IDB in the design of supporting adjustment operations loans and investment loans. For
instance, the Bank's Trade Reform Adjustment Loan (TRAL) was paralleled by a
complementary Trade Institutional Strengthening operation by IDB, and IDB's Financial
Sector Adjustment loan was complemented by the Bank's FSAL. A similar strategy has
been followed as to investment project loans with close coordination between the two
banks in support of the social emergency program (FONCODES), transport infrastructure
rehabilitation, and health sector reform. The IDB is currently preparing an investment
sector loan supporting those elements of the Government program designed to: (i)
modernize the state, (ii) improve regulation in a variety of areas (including public utilities),
and (iii) strengthen banking supervision.
IV. THE PROPOSED LOAN
Origin
76.   The Bank's involvement in the area of pension reform in Peru began with the
FSAL and continued with economic and sector work--Peru: Public Expenditure Review
of October, 1994 (Report No 131 90-PE) and Peru: Policy Notes of July, 1995
(Report.No 14824-PE) and policy advise. A number of these reports' recommendations
were taken up in Law 26504 and DL 817. The proposed loan is the outcome of a close
dialogue between the Bank and the Government on the need to deepen pension reform,
strengthen Peru's capital market and increase domestic savings.
Objectives
77.   As a result of the establishment of public order and successful implementation of
the reform program, Peru's economy has greatly improved since 1990. However, a
significant part of the economic growth and poverty reduction experienced in recent years
has been of a one-time nature and, without a sustained flow of new investment, they will
be difficult to replicate. Financing this investment would require higher domestic savings
and broader access to long-term external funds.



21
78.   The reforms supported by this loan would contribute to increase domestic savings,
strengthen the medium-term fiscal outlook, broaden access to long-term external
financing, and provide a clear signal of the Government's deterrmination to stay the course.
They would help increase savings and strengthen the fiscal outlook by way of (i)
deepening pension reform, (ii) improving the efficiency of capital markets, and (iii)
earmarking part of the privatization proceeds to back pension obligations. This use of
privatization receipts underscores the need for external financing for the DDSR operation
with the commercial banks. The DDSR agreement would contribute to broaden access to
long-term external financing.
79.   Performance indicators of the impact of the reforms recognized by this loan will
be: (i) the changes in the rate of affiliation to the SPP before and after the initiation of the
second stage of pension reform; (ii) an increase in the percentage of workers in the 20-31
age cohort affiliated to the SPP; (iii) the earmarking of part of the future privatization
proceeds to the FCRP; (iv) the offer of a broader range of options available to the affiliates
of the SPP; and (v) the reduction of the total cost of tne CV system.
Rationale for Bank Involvement
80.   The balance of payments support provided by the PRAL is necessary in spite of
Peru's strong foreign exchange reserve position. First, because the economy is highly
dollarized and the capital account is completely open, high foreign exchange reserves
reduce exposure to short term capital outflows and are a critical ingredient for the stability
of the financial system. Secondly, about 44 percent of the direct financial requirements for
the DDSR agreement will be met with Peru's foreign reserves. Financing a higher
percentage of the up-front cost of the DDSR agreement, while, at the same time,
allocating US$1 billion of the international reserves to the pension trust fund, would
jeopardize the stability of the external financing program.
81.   The amount of this PRAL is determined by the Government short-term financing
needs (fifty percent of the amount would be set aside to finance part of the cost of the
DDSR agreement), the quality of the program and the clear Government commitment to
allocate a significant part of the receipts from privatization to the FCRP to back the issue
of new securities resulting from the pension reform. The policy actions supported under
this proposed PRAL, particularly the use of privatization proceeds to back pension
obligations, underscore the need for external financing for the DDSR.agreement. The
proposed PRAL would be presented to the Board together with a free-standing DDSR
loan of US$183 million.
Description and Co-Financing
82.   Loan Size. A single tranche loan of US$100 million is proposed to be made
available upon loan effectiveness, anticipated for December 1996. The Republic of Peru
would be the borrower and implementation would be shared by the Ministry of Economy
and Finance, and agencies responsible for social security--ONP and the Private Pension
Fund Superintendency (SAFP)--and capital markets--Capital Market Superintendency



22
(CONASEV). Fifty percent of the funds provided by this would be set aside to finance
part of the cost of the DDSR agreement. The provisions regulating the set-asides are
included in an implementation agreement to be signed between the Republic of Peru and
the Bank. The loan closing date would be March 31, 1997. 12
83.   Proposed Tranche Conditionality. The conditions below (para. 84) have been
selected based on their importance in the setting up of the new pension system. In
addition to the specific actions listed below, tranche release would also be contingent upon
maintenance of a macroeconomic framework consistent with the objectives set forth in the
Letter of Sector Policy.
84.   The following actions were taken prior to Board Presentation:
*  Reform of the 'Cedula Viva" System: DL 817 of April 1996 (i) established the right
of and instituted incentives for public employees to transfer from the CV to the SPP;
(ii) authorized the National Pension Office (ONP) to audit all claims for benefits to the
CV regime to determine their legitimacy; (iii) established that adjustments of pensions
of employees of formerly owned state enterprises will be subject to the same
limitations as SNP pensions and (iv) established a ceiling for CV pensions.
*  Reform of the National Pension System: Law 26504 of July 1995 (i) eliminated
differences in contribution rates and retirement ages between the SNP and the SPP;
and (ii) increased the minimum retirement age to claim benefits from the SNP. DL
874 of November 1996 broadened the eligibility criteria to apply for a 'Bono de
Reconocimiento'.
*  Reform of the Private Pension System: DL 874 of November 1996: (i) eliminated
the use of a benchmark rate of return for the industry and of 'bands' around this rate
of return; (ii) required that investments results be reported on a regular basis net of
fees; and (iii) expanded the categories of securities in which AFPs can invest.
*  Reforms Developing a Framework for Asset and Liability Management: Law
26504 (i) required the ONP to periodically estimate the actuarial cost of pension
obligations under the SNP and CV regimes and from the issue of BRs and (ii)
instituted the FCRP--to back pension obligations. A DS (to be passed in November
1996) will establish the regulatory regime of the FCRP. A DS will authorize the
deposit of US$1 billion from Treasury resources in the FCRP, and communication by
December 10, 1996 will confirm such a deposit was made in the FCRP Deposit
Account.
*  Complementary Capital Market Reforms: DL 861 and DL 862 of October 1996:
(i) established a framework for the operation of investment funds; (ii) provided a solid
base for securitization of otherwise illiquid financial assets such as mortgage loans and
12 At 20 percent of the three-year adjustment lending program the US$50 million set-aside from the
proposed PRAL is below the Bank guideline (25 percent).



23
consumer credit- receivables; (iii) simplified the regulation of mutual funds; (iv)
improved regulation pertaining to short term paper and convertible bonds (vi)
introduced the concept of self-regulation of the stock market.
85.   Effectiveness and disbursement conditions for the Implementation Agreement are
the same as provided for the DDSR Loan (para. 40 of the MOP). The Bank will provide
up to 100 percent retroactive financing on the set-aside part of this loan, if needed, on the
basis of eligible expenditures incurred after September 1, 1996.13
86.   Co-Financing. The JEXIM Bank will provide US$100 million in cofinancing to
the PRAL and the IMF's EFF. The amounts of cofinancing with each instrument will be
determined shortly. The JEXIM Bank loans will be part of the package of official support
for the DDSR Agreement.
Technical Assistance
87.   The technical assistance requirements to identify and design future steps in pension
reform will be financed through part of an existing Japanese Policy and Human Resources
Development (PHRD) Grant in the amount of US$550,000 equivalent (61.5 million yen)
obtained to support the preparation and implementation of the proposed loan. In addition
the Bank is working on a technical assistance project to improve public sector
management and additional technical assistance for future adjustment operations, if
needed, could be included in this TA project.
Disbursements, Accounts, and Audit
88.   The Ministry of Economy and Finance, the Borrower of the loan, would be
responsible for submitting withdrawal applications. Upon loan effectiveness, one half of
loan proceeds (US$50 million) will be disbursed directly to the settlement agent for the
DDSR operation to purchase collateral and finance buyback operations. The remaining
half will be deposited by the Bank in a Deposit Account opened and maintained by the
Borrower in US dollars. If after deposit in this Deposit Account, the proceeds of the loan
are used for ineligible purposes (e.g., to finance items imported from non-member
countries, or goods or services in the standard negative list), the Bank will require the
Borrower to either: (i) return that amount to the account for use for eligible purposes; or
(b) refund the amount directly to the Bank, in which case the Bank will cancel an
equivalent undisbursed amount of the loan. Such remaining half will not be utilized for
financing the costs of the DDSR agreement
89.   The Ministry of Economy and Finance will maintain separate records and accounts
for all transactions under the loan. Upon the Bank's request, the Borrower shall have the
Deposit account audited by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank in accordance
13  After the confirmation of Bank's responses in August 31, 1996 the Govermnent started purchasing
the necessary collateral.



24
with the loan agreement. The records and accounts for the set-asides will be audited by
independent auditors acceptable to the Bank in accordance with the implementation
agreement.
Monitoring and Reporting
90.   Monitoring and reporting will be facilitated through the close coordination of
activities and implementation agencies and direct technical assistance from the Bank.
Under the Japanese PHRD Grant, technical assistance is being provided to assist the
Government in the implementation of the overall program through ONP, SAFP and
CONASEV.
Benefits and Risks
91.   Benefits. This loan supports reforms that will (i) reduce the domestic debt
overhang and strengthen the medium-term fiscal outlook, and (ii) provide a judicious use
for part of the privatization proceeds. These are key to finance the large scale capital
accumulation the country needs to create new jobs and support sustained increases in
productivity.
92.   The approach adopted to reduce domestic debt is similar to the one used to reduce
external debt. The reform of the pension system results in debt and debt service reduction
by way of repackaging contingent pension liabilities into new pension obligations backed
by a pension trust fund. This will increase domestic savings by (i) allowing a larger set of
individuals to have access to individual accounts, (ii) making more transparent the state of
the public pension systems, and (iii) strengthening the medium-term fiscal outlook.
93.   The establishment of a pension trust fund and the use of privatization proceeds to
feed this trust fund breaks new grounds in linking asset management during a privatization
program with liability management during a domestic debt repackaging program (pension
reform). The trust fund is an enhancement to the new debt created by the pension reform
and its establishment makes more attractive to individuals to participate in such voluntary
program of debt restructuring.
94.   Risks. The main risk to this operation is in maintaining sustained Government
commitment to complete the several steps that will result in the completion of the pension
reform. The measures adopted between July 1995 and October 1996 supported by this
loan have popular support. While the amendments to the 'Cedula Viva' regime affect a
privileged group of pensioners they have popular support because the CV regime is
perceived as highly corrupted. Similarly, the reforms introduced by DL 874 have popular
support because they promote competition among the AFPs and reduce the Government's
discretionality to manage the large privatization proceeds. But the completion of the
reform of the SNP will require a great deal of consensus building and may be a sensitive
political issue (see paragraphs 62 to 66). Also, the continued build up of the Trust Fund



25
with the receipts from privatization may face strong opposition from politicians which
prefer discretionality rather than rules.
95.   Overall, these risks are mitigated by a combination of factors. First, the reform of
the pension system is not opposed by the vast majority of the people who work in the
informal sector and have never reaped benefits from any of the publicly sponsored
regimes. Second, the reform will release in the medium term resources from the public
budget which can and should be used to improve the quality of education, health and
nutrition programs which directly benefit the poor. Third, because it is a self-imposed
disciplining measure, the Government decision to establish a trust fund with the receipts
from privatization, cannot be seriously attacked by the opposition.
96.   Progress over the past five years, the relative irreversibility of some key actions
and growing public appreciation of the benefits of the reforms accomplished present a
favorable environment for further measures. The private sector has now seen the
successful sustaining of Peru's fiscal position and turn from hyperinflation. The policy
reform supported by this proposed loan will help guard against erosion of public
confidence and reversal of the policy framework.
Environmental Impact
97.   There are no negative environmental impacts associated with this loan, which
therefore, has an environment rating of "C".
V. RECOMMENDATION
98.   I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement
of the Bank, and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.

LETTER OF SECTOR POLICY
PENSION REFORM ADJUSTMENT LOAN
November25, 1996
Mr. James Wolfensohn
President
The World Bank
Dear Mr. Wolfensohn:
1.    The Government of Peru has taken significant steps over the past 18 months to
deepen the reform of its pension system and to improve the efficiency of its capital market.
The Government is now requesting from the International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development a Pension Reform Adjustment Loan (PRAL) of US$ 100 million to support
the implementation of these measures.
2.   In support of this request this Letter of Sector Policy and accompanying Policy
Matrix describe: (i) the Government medium-term macroeconomic stabilization program
and progress in Peru's reintegration into the international financial community; (ii) its
medium-term adjustment program; (iii) the medium-term objectives and guidelines of the
pension reform program, identifying specific measures that will be undertaken before the
presentation of this loan to tlhe Board and further measures the Government intends to
undertake following Board approval; and (iv) the reforms directed at improving the
efficiency of the Peruvian capital markets to intermediate funds.
Background
3.    The defeat of terrorism and the free market policies implemented by Peru since
1990 have resulted in a remarkable economic recovery. Over the past six years inflation
has gone down (from 7600 percent in 1990 to 10 percent in 1995), there has been
vigorous economic growth (GDP up 30 percent since 1990) and poverty has been reduced
(the percentage of families below the poverty line went down from 55 percent in 1991 to
50 percent in 1994). Even so, the Government is aware that a significant part of this
economic growth and poverty reduction has been of a one-time nature, difficult to
replicate without sustained investment in physical and human capital. Financing this
investment will require higher domestic savings and broader access to long-term external
funds. Deepening the reform of the pension system (described in paragraphs 15 to 26)
will increase domestic savings, while, reintegrating Peru into the international financial
community (through the Paris Club agreement of July 1996 and the Brady agreement with
the commercial banks to be closed in December 1996) will increase access to long-term
external financing.



27                             Annex 1
The Macroeconomic Program
4.    The Government's macroeconomic program for 1996-98, supported by the
Intemational Monetary Fund through an Extended Fund Facility approved on July 1,
1996, aims to sustain economic growth, lower inflation and maintain a strong international
reserve position. The GDP is projected to grow at 6 percent by 1998 (up from an
estimated 2.5 percent in 1996) and inflation is projected to fall to industrialized country
levels by the end of the period (down from 10-11 percent in 1996).
5.    The program aims to reduce the current account deficit. Thus the projected
increase in the ratio of investment to GDP from 24 percent in 1995 to 25.5 percent in
1998 is more than offset by the projected increase in domestic savings from 16.5 percent
of GDP in 1995 to 20.5 percent in 1998. To that end the Government will not only
continue to encourage higher private domestic saving but also will increase the primary
surplus from 0.3 percent of GDP in 1995 to one percent in 1996, and 2 percent in 1998.
Also, the nonfinancial public sector balance (before privatization receipts) is projected to
move from a 2.6 percent deficit in 1995 to about equilibrium by 1998. The projected
improvement in the fiscal accounts is based on continuous strengthening of the tax
administration and a reduction in spending as a percentage of GDP--the result of higher
efficiency in the provision of public goods and services.
6.    During 1996 the Government has taken decisive steps towards (i) reintegrating
Peru into the international financial market and (ii) reducing the domestic debt overhang.
The 1996 Paris Club agreement provides debt relief for 1996-98 and reprofiles maturities
falling due after January 1999, corresponding to debts previously rescheduled under the
Paris Club of 1991. The debt and debt service reduction (DDSR) operation with the
commercial banks encompasses about US$10.8 billion of commercial debt. The
agreement includes a Brady-type menu of options and has an upfront cost of about
US$1.4 billion. The reform of the pension system results in domestic debt and debt
service reduction by way of repackaging contingent pension liabilities into new pension
obligations backed by a pension trust fund.
7.    About forty percent of the direct financial requirements for the DDSR agreement
will be met with Peru's own foreign reserves. Financing a higher percentage of the
upfront cost of the DDSR agreement, while, at the same time, allocating US$ 1 billion of
the international reserves to the pension trust fund account (see paragraphs 14 to 24
below) would jeopardize the stability of the extemal financing program. Thus the
Government has requested additional financing from the international financial institutions
and the Export-Import Bank of Japan to complete the financing of the DDSR agreement.
The Medium-Term Adjustment Program
8.    Peru has transformed its economic policy since 1990. It has opened its economy
to competition with the rest of the world and allowed unrestricted inflows and outflows of
capital. It has eliminated domestic public monopolies and liberalized prices of goods and



28                              Annex 1
services. It has deregulated the labor market and liberalized the financial system while, at
the same time, strengthening prudential regulation. It has launched a vast privatization
program. It has reformed its tax administration and rebuilt the tax base.
9.    Now Peru is entering a second stage of reform. The challenge at this new stage is
to consolidate a dynamic market economy, one that creates jobs and supports sustained
increases in productivity. This will require: (i) strengthening the efficiency of the domestic
market by reducing distortions and completing the privatization program; (ii) creating an
inviting environment for private investment in areas where the reform process has
proceeded at a slower pace (agriculture and infrastructure); (iii) increasing the quality of
provision of health and education services; and (iv) improving the efficiency of
government provision of public goods and services.
10.   To improve the efficiency of the economy the Government has substantially
deregulated the labor market and will (i) continue opening the economy to trade and
competition with the rest of the world; (ii) establish an efficient regulatory regime in
fisheries and (iii) complete the privatization program. Law 26513 of July 1995 and DL
855 of September 1996, continue the process launched in 1991 with DL 728, to make the
labor market more flexible, thus facilitating job creation in the formal sector. To increase
competition with the rest of the world the Government will continue to reduce average
tariffs and tariff dispersion. To support the efficient exploitation of the fisheries resource
the Government will enact a new regulatory regime during the first-half of 1997. To
advance with the privatization program the Government will finalize the privatization of
Petroperu during the first half of 1997, and remaining state-owned electricity and mining
companies during 1997-1998.
11.   New private investment in agriculture and basic infrastructure are critical for
Peru's medium-term economic growth and poverty reduction. Because of security
problems modernization of agriculture has lagged behind developments in other sectors of
the economy. To encourage private investment in agriculture the Government enacted in
July 1995 Law 26505 eliminating limits on private land ownership in the agricultural
sector. It also enacted in April 1996 DL 807 allowing the transformation of sugar
cooperatives into corporate businesses. In the future the Government intends to (i)
accelerate the registration of titles on agricultural land, and to (ii) promote a more efficient
use of water resources through a new water law. To promote private investment in
infrastructure the Government enacted a new concessions law (DL 839) in August 1996
allowing private participation through long-term concessions in t:-e provision of most
public infrastructure services.
12.   The Government is aware that significant poverty reduction requires sustained
improvements in health and education. Government will continue improving access and
quality of basic health services to the poor. DL 887 of November 1996, encourages
broader private participation in these areas through greater competition in the provision
and financing of health services. To improve the quality of education the Government will
continue to rehabilitate infrastructure, modernize the curricula, upgrade the training of



29                              Annex 1
teachers and decentralize greater authority over school administration to the school
directors. DL 882 of November 1996 encourages broader private sector participation in
all levels of education through greater competition in the provision and financing of
educational services.
13.   The Government's poverty reduction strategy since 1990 has been multi-faceted.
It has reestablished public order, price stability and structural reform. It has also
successfully used targeted programs and secured property rights as means to alleviate the
condition of the poor and extreme poor. To that effect Foncodes, which implemented
more than 20,160 projects for US$766 million in social infrastructure between 1992 and
1996, will continue playing an important role. And the Government has launched an
ambitious program to provide registered titles to urban properties.
14.   To improve the efficiency of state provision of public goods the Government will
pursue a program to modernize the public administration. The Government enacted DL
834 in July 1996, placing new administrative personnel in the Judiciary under private
sector labor regulation rules. It also established an internal evaluation process to help
improve performance of the judiciary.
The Pension Reform Program
15.   The reform of Peru's pension system started in 1992. The first step was Law
25897, authorizing a system of private pension funds (AFPs) as an alternative to the 'pay
as you go' National Pension System (SNP). The new regime (SPP) permits workers to
open individual retirement accounts in AFPs, and receive partial credit for previous
contributions to the National Pension System (SNP) through a bond--'Bono de
Reconocimiento' (BR). While Law 25897 was an essential first step in that it launched a
fully financed pension system, it (i) maintained both different contribution rates and
different retirement ages for the SNP and the SPP, (ii) did not allow the migration to the
SPP of public employees covered by Peru's oldest and most expensive, defined benefit
system, 'Cedula Viva' (CV), and (iii) did not close entry to the SNP regime to new
entrants of the labor force.
16.   The second step in the reform of the pension system was taken by Law 26504 of
July 1995, which eliminated differences in contribution rates and retirement ages between
the SNP and the SPP. These measures brought about a significant increase in transfers
from the SNP to the SPP after July 1995 and reduced, through the increase in retirement
age, the contingent pension obligations of the SNP.
17.   The third step in the reform of the pension system was the enactment of DL 817 of
April, 1996. It (i) unambiguously established the right of public employees to transfer
from the CV to the SPP; (ii) gave authority to the National Pension Office (ONP) to audit
all claims for benefits to the CV regime to determine their legitimacy; (iii) required the
ONP to periodically estimate the actuarial cost of the pension obligations (PO) under the
SNP and CV regimes and from the issue of BRs, (iv) instituted the pension trust fund--



30                               Annex 1
Fondo Consolidado de Reservas Previsionales (FCRP)--to back pension obligations; (v)
established that adjustments of pensions of employees of formerly owned state enterprises
will be subject to the same limitations as SNP pensions; (vi) instituted incentives for
migration from the CV regime to the SPP; (vii) established a ceiling for CV pensions--at
the level of remuneration of a member of Congress. Thus DL 817 significantly reduced
the future impact of the CV regime on the Treasury's coffers, established grounds for an
accounting system that quantifies and recognizes contingent pension obligations and
created a pension trust fund to back these obligations.
18.   Peru is currently in a transition stage where a fully funded regime (SPP) covering
about 1,400,000 employees coexists with (i) a 'pay-as-you-go' regime (SNP) covering
about 980,000 active and about 320,000 retired employees and (ii) a privileged defined
benefit regime (CV) which covers about 50,000 active and 250,000 retired civil servants
and employees of former state owned enterprises. At about 1.5 million, the number of
workers affiliated to the unfunded publicly sponsored pension regimes is still high and so
are the state contingent pension liabilities. At the same time, operating costs of the private
pension system's AFPs are high, and their investment opportunities in Peru's capital
markets are still limited. Thus, continuing the shrinkage and control of benefits in the
public pension system and simultaneous strengthening of the private system is critical to
improve the medium and long-term fiscal outlook.
19.   To that effect the Government enacted new legislation and regulation in November
1996. To encourage higher migration of young workers from the SNP to the SPP, the
Government enacted in November 1996 DL874 easing the eligibility criteria to apply for a
BR. Under the new law, all new applicants who have contributed to the SNP for 48
months within the 10 years before December 1996, will be able to receive a BR. To
establish a unified framework for asset and liability management the Government will
enact in November 1996 a Supreme Decree establishing the regulatory regime for the
FCRP and will transfer by December 10, 1996 to this fund, to back BR obligations, US$1
billion of Treasury deposits previously held at the Central Bank and/or Banco de la
Nacion. The regulatory regime of the FCRP will provide transparency as to the current
state of the asset and liability situation of the publicly sponsored pension systems.
20.   The November 1996 DL874 also took some significant initial steps to discourage
high fees and increase competition of AFPs. It eliminated the use of a benchmark rate of
return for the industry and of 'bands' around this rate of return, thus increasing the
benefits achievable by AFPs for relative overperformance, and reducing the penalties for
relative underperformance. It also required that investment results be reported on a
regular basis net of fees, and expanded the categories of securities in which AFPs can
invest.
21.   The next stage in the reform of the pension system will include measures (i) to
strengthen the quality of the regulatory regime for pension funds and the capacity of the
respective regulatory institution, (ii) to establish a unified framework for pension asset and
liability management including the use of government extraordinary revenues and (iii) to



31                              Annex 1
liability management including the use of government extraordinary revenues and (iii) to
continue reducing the debt and debt service resulting from publicly sponsored pension
programs.
22.   The Government is persuaded that the current pension fund regulatory regime
does not encourage an efficient intermediation of funds. The current situation of the AFP
industry shows remarkable similarity in aggregate portfolio composition (shares invested
in stocks, bonds, bank CDs etc.) as well as individual stock holdings which is reflected in
increasing convergence of values of AFP quotas. In addition, at two percent of salaries,
the commissions charged for managing the accounts are high compared to similar systems
in other countries.
23.   To improve the efficiency of financial intermediation of the AFPs, the Government
will enact during the first-half of 1997 a new regulatory framework to encourage the offer
of a diversified range of financial products and a more transparent disclosure of risk and
will review the present regulatory structure to explore possible reductions in complexity
and cost.
24.   To introduce more transparency as to the financial situation of the publicly
sponsored pension regimes as well as to the fiscal outlook, the Government will issue, in
the first-half of 1997, budgetary rules consistent with the accounting of the accrued costs
of the contingent pension obligations. These rules will determine mechanisms to reduce
the difference between the pension obligations and the value of assets of the FCRP
through the transfer of ordinary and extraordinary revenue from the Treasury to the
FCRP.
25.   To encourage migration of workers with legitimate claims to CV benefits to the
SPP, the Government will issue the regulation required to implement the incentive
schemes introduced in DL 817 and will complete the audit of claims to benefits during
1997.
26.   To define future steps in pension reform the Government will prepare during the
first half of 1997 a study analyzing the state of the SNP. This study will address the costs
and benefits of alternative courses of action to reduce the contingent obligations of the
SNP. In particular, it will compare the alternative of a gradual phase out of the SNP with
that of transforming the SNP into a fully financed pension regime. Following the
recommendations of the study the Government will design and implement the necessary
changes in the pension regulatory framework during the second-half of 1997.
The Reform of Capital Market Regulation
27.   The improvements in the economy after 1990 and the modernization of the capital
market regulatory regime after 1992 have resulted in a significant increase in the capacity
of Peru's capital market to intermediate funds. As a result, stock market capitalization
increased from US$1,124 million in 1992 to US$15,221 million in 1996, the value of



32                              Annex 1
bond and short-term commercial paper financing went up from US$125 million in 1992 to
US$435 million in 1995, and foreign portfolio investment increased from US$27 million in
1992 to US$1,875 million in 1995. The expansion of the private pension funds--with
assets valued at US$1 billion as of October 1996--contributed significantly to these
results.
28.   The reforms of 1992 enacted in DL 755, the capital markets law, helped start or
increased use of n 'vw financial institutions and instruments (such as mutual funds, ADRs,
and corporate bonds) and improved regulatory oversight and trading and information
systems. Notwithsta, ling these improvements it has been necessary to modify the
regulatory regpmre to (i) incorporate the use of new financial instruments into Peru's
capital marke' i): improve the regulatory environment and (iii) expand the range of
instruments available for investment of institutional investors such as the AFPs.
29.   Legislative Decrees 861 and 862 of October 1996 introduce improvements in
capital markets regulation. They (i) establish a framework for the operation of investment
funds; (ii) provide a solid base for securitization of otherwise illiquid financial assets such
as mortgage loans and consumer credit receivables; (iii) simplify the regulation of mutual
funds; (iv) improve regulation pertaining to short term paper and convertible bonds; (v)
increase capital requirements for financial intermediaries; (vi) introduce the concept of
self-regulation of the stock market; (vii) establish the independence of the agent in charge
of the clearing and liquidation of financial transactions in the stock market; and (viii)
improve market transparency. It is expected that experience with the mechanisms
introduced by DL 861 and DL 862 will require further adjustments and refinements in the
framework to implement the concept of an essentially self-regulating market and limited
government involvement.
30.   The Government of Peru is committed to consolidate the program of reforms
started in 1990. The implementation of the policies described in this Letter of
Development Policy ?.re in accordance with the Extended Fund Facility agreement with
the IMF and will contribute to sustained economic growth and poverty reduction with
macroeconomic stability. As we implement the measures discussed in paragraphs 21 to
29 we intend to approach the Bank for further support through policy advice, technical
assistance, and/or adjustment lending.

PENSION REFORM TECHNICAL APPENDIX
Introduction
This appendix provides background on the methodology to calculate the value of a BR
set forth by DL25897, explains the methodology used to estimate the costs resting from the
reforms enacted in DL 874 of November 1996, and the methodology to estimate the costs and
benefits of the reform presented in paragraph 61 of the document. The first section describes
methodological aspects of the estimation of a BR. The second section presents the methodology
to calculate the value of the BRs under DL 874. The third section describes the methodology
used to calculate the costs and benefits of the transfer of about 130,000 workers in the age
cohort 25-31 from the SNP to the SPP.
Calculation of the Value of a Bono de Reconocimiento 1992
When developing the new private pension system, Peru's government adopted most of
Chile's system. Among those, they created the Bonos de Reconocimiento, an instrument that
recognizes past contributions to the old system. The idea behind these bonds is simple. While
the pension system worked as a pay-as-you-go system, there was no legal link between past
contributions and benefits at the individual level. The benefits offered by the Peruvian Social
Security System were financed with contributions of currently working affiliates and, in principle,
no accumulation of funds was needed. Instead, when switching to a capitalization regime,
accumulated contributions became the central parameter in determining benefits. Two options
were available to circumvent this problem. First, the Government could pay monthly benefits to
those who retire under the capitalization system in a level compatible with the contributions they
made before switching to the new system. The total amount of benefits would result from the
monthly payment from the public system, and the benefits paid from the capitalization system.
This approach was chosen in Argentina's reform. The second choice is that the Government can
promise that, by the time individuals retire, it will make a one-time transfer to the individuals'
account at the AFP, increasing their funds, in a level compatible with the contributions these
individuals made to the old system. This alternative was chosen in Chile and, similarly, in Peru.
According to the decree-law 25897, the face value of the bonds should reflect the total
contributions made to the old system by its affiliates. Because of the difficulties that would be
created by the need to actualize old contributions, and the lack of reliable records, a relatively
simple formula was defined to calculate the value of the bonds in the decree supreme 206-92.
This formula indicated that the face value of the bond ("B") will be equal to the multiplication of
the number of months an individual contributed before December 1992 ("M") times the average
salary of the last 12 months previous to December 1992 ("S") times an adjustment factor
(0.1831). Thus:
B=MxSx0.1831                         [1]



37
Because there were no adequate records to calculate the exact number of months with
past contributions those had to be estimated. Supreme decree (DS) 602-92 defined a table that
has been used to determine an assumed number of months with contributions, based on the age
of the worker. This table defines the number of months as approximately half of the elapsed
months between the 20th birthday of the worker and December 1992. Nevertheless, an option is
left open to the workers to prove he has made contributions for longer period than results from
the application of the table.
The second parameter needed to determine the value of the bonds is the average salary of
the last 12 months prior to December 1992. Because the ONP had no adequate records of actual
contributions, initially there was no clear procedure defined to calculate this amount. Later on,
a mechanism based on sworn statement presented by the workers was admited as the basis to
determnine the relevant salaries.
Since the only pension obligation the government will assume with the changing system is
the recognition bonds, calculating the future flow of expenses is relatively simple. The annual
government expenditure on recognition bonds ("Et") on any year "t" can be calculated with
equation 2:
N
E  =  E    M.xS.xS  x0.1831    [2]
a-1
When 'N' is the number of workers with rights to receive a bond retiring on year "t". Thus,
knowing the age distribution of Peru's active population, we can make a first estimation of the
expected annual expense.
While 2 million workers qualified, in principle, to receive a BR when DL 25897 was
enacted, the actual number of bonds issued as of October 1996 is 48,301. This is because a large
number of workers decided to stay within the SNP, and also a significant group of workers for
one reason or another have not applied for them. According to the AFP Superintendency, about
fifty percent of the workers affiliated to an AFP declared they do not qualify to receive a bond.
According to the law, the salary used in the calculation of the BR was the average of the
last twelve months, prior to December 1992. The formula used to calculate the average salary
considers the current, and not real, salaries. Thus, we must estimate the level of inflation induced
erosion on this average salary. Calling the 1992 monthly salaries "Wjan" to "Wdc'" we can define
the average salary "S" as:
S= I x [Wjan + Wfb + Wr + + WdeC]           [3]
1 2
Now, if we assume a constant monthly inflation rate "i", the value of salaries, measured in
salaries of December 1992 would be:

Calculation of the Bono de Reconocimiento of DL 874
It is based on a similar methodology than that used to calculate the BR defined in
DL25896. The nominal value of the bond (B) is defined in [8].
B = A x S x 1.952                      [8]
where:
S = Average monthly salary
A = Number of years of contribution
Equation [8] results from [9]:
B = (S x12) x (0.6) x (A/45) x (12.2)               [8]
where:
R x 12 = Annual earnings
0.60 = Replacement rate



39
A/45 = Years of contribution to the defined benefit system as a percentage of years of work
(defined as retirement age (65) minus estimated age of entry to the labor force (20)).
12.2 = The present value of an annuity of one sol received at retirement.
Methodology to Calculate the Cost of the Reform Introduced by DL 874
The inputs are (i) the age structure of the SNP affiliates, (ii) the average earnings per age
cohort, (iii) sex--the data is in Table 1 of Annex 3. Because we do not have the actual age
structure of the SNP affiliates in 1995 we estimated it. The estimate was done first, starting with
the age structure of SNP affiliates in 1992 and assuming an annual rate of growth of 2 percent
we obtained the hypothetical age structure of the SNP in 1995 had the SPP not been created.
Second, we subtracted the actual population of the SPP from the projected population of the
SNP to get the 1995 age structure of the SNP. The average earnings per age bracket for males
and females come from the 1994 household survey.
To estimate the present value of the fiscal cost we estimate the value of losses in
contributions plus the present value of the BR. The estimated loss in contributions is forecasted
projecting the earnings of those currently in the age cohort 25-31. We use the estimate of the
effect of experience to future earnings implied by the parameters estimated in the regressions
presented in Table 3 of Annex 3 and the average years of education for Lima presented in Table
2 of Annex 3. In addition we assume an annual rate of growth of earnings of 2 percent. To
estimate the costs of the 'status quo' we assume that nobody transfers from the SNP to the SPP
and as a result the SNP has to pay pensions at retirement. The calculation of the pensions is
based on the same methodology to estimate earnings at retirement age used in the 'transfer'
scenario.
