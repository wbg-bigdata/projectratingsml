                                      Extension of Closing Date

1.    The closing date for Sierra Leone Infrastructure Development Project (Grants H1910-SL, and
H4050-SL, and Credit 4469-SL) will be extended from March 31, 2013 until September 13, 2013.
2.      The PDO and overall implementation progress are rated “Satisfactory? in the last
Implementation Status report dated January 28, 2013. Key reforms and works have been
implemented resulting in rehabilitated roads, airport and port facilities, in accordance with the
project objectives. Major port reforms have been undertaken resulting in improved operational
efficiency at the port; road maintenance funding and management of works has been separated
and expected to lead to more effective management of sector expenditures. Feeder road
rehabilitation is under way in the Bonthe and Kono districts, and completion of the ancillary civil
works at the port will lead to higher levels of operational safety on completion. As at March 2,
2013, disbursements under IDA H1910, IDA H44690 and IDA H4050 stood at $43.82 million
(or 84.7%), $4.66 million (or 81.89%) and $0.33 million (or 7.2%) respectively, with the total
estimated available funds at $9.26 million to date. Increased disbursement activities are
expected in the next few months as project activities are completed. These are all geared towards
achieving the project’s objectives.

3.      The proposed extension is necessary to allow for the completion of the ongoing
rehabilitation of the feeder roads. The contracts for feeder roads were signed on August 15, 2012,
but major activities including culvert and bridge works, as well as earthworks could not begin
until December 2012 due to excessive rains in the country. Consequent to the unfavorable
weather, the contractors lost 2-3 months of the seven month contract duration. Furthermore,
some of the sites were inaccessible due to challenging terrain made worse by the rains and
contractors had to construct temporary access to enable transportation of materials to site. The
2012 general election and Christmas holidays further cut into the implementation period of these
contracts as the Contractors could not fully mobilize the necessary work force during this period.
The feeder roads contracts are labor based and provide an important source of employment for
the communities in the rural areas where the works are located. The Borrower has prepared an
action plan indicating completion of the contracts within the revised closing date providing an
additional five and a half month period for contract implementation.

4.       This will be the second extension of the project with a cumulative extension of 23.5 months,
(the first extension was for 18 months), from March 31, 2013, to September 13, 2013.
