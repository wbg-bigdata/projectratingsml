MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIREiToRS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO TIHE REPUBLIC OF VENEZUELA
FOR A NATIONAL PMRS MANWAEMENT PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to the
Republic of Venezuela for US$55.0 million equivalent is submitted for approval.
The loan would be repayable in 15 years, including 5 years of grace, at the
Bank's standard variable interi-st rate. It would help finance a national parks
management project in Venezuela.
2.        Backaround.   Venezuela has a long conservation tradition, having
established its first national park in 1937w greatly expanded its protected areas
system (Areas Bajo Regimen Especial, ABRAE) between 1940-83; and created the
first Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (MARNR) in Latin America in
1977.   Venezuela also has a National Institute of Parks (INPARQUES) and a
National Wildlife Office (PROFAUNA), a strong non-governmental conservation
movement, and a comprehensive body of sound environmental legislation. As a
result, today the country has the basic legal and regulatory framework needed to
implement envircomental conservation projects. A grey cover Environmental Issues
Paper for Venezuela (IBRD Report No. 8272-VE, issued in December 1991) documents
these and other environmental achievements. However, the report also points to
the need for stronger efforts to integrate environmental concerns into
development and investment planning; to strengthen the institutional capacity
of MARNR and the main public environmental agencies; and to improve substantially
the management of the extensive biodiversity resources present in Venezuela's
protected areas system.
3.          Venezuela  has  been  identified  as  one  of  the  world's  most
biologically diverse countries, and has been classified by the World Wildlife
Fund for Nature as one of Latin America's six megadiversity countries.
Indicators include over 21,000 species of high vascular plants, 5,000 of which
are judged to be endemic to Venezuela} some 1,300 species of birds out of a world
total of 9,000; 40% of the 3,300 known species of aeotropical birds; and more
than 300 species of mammals, 18 of which are classified as endangered. To manage
its biodiversity wealth and protect its natural resources, over the past 50 years
Venezuela has put a significant part of its territory under different forms of
protection. Today Venezuela's national parks and monuments encompass 15% of the
national territory (compared with a world average of 5'.
4.        Established in 1978 to administer national parks, natural monuments
and urban/recreational parks, INPARQUES is a relatively successful protected
areas management agency with a sizeable cadre of highly motivated personnel.
Most of the parks and wildlands for which INPARQUES is responsible are not "paper
parks", but rather have at least some physical presence and on-site management.
Nonetheless, Venezuela's national park system has expanded rapidly over the last
few decades, and the large number of newly created parks has strained INPARQUES'
abllity to fulfill its legally-mandated responsibilities, partly. because of its
present fairly centralized structure and staffing/skills mix pattern  (in
particular, inadequate numbers of technical staff and trained park guards,
compared with administrative personnel and unskilled laborers), exacerbated by



-2 -
budgetary constraints associated with declines in domestic oil revenues. Hence,
the rapid expansion of Venezuela's protected areas system now needs to be
followed by a period of consolidation and more effective management of these
areas, with niignificant emphasis on the institutional strengthening of INPARQUES.
The proposed project would address these needs.
5.        RatIonal, for Dank Involvement.  The Bank's operational strategy in
Venezuela is to increase decentralization and efficiency of public services;
private sector development; poverty alleviation; and environmental protection.
Through its assistance to INPARQUES, the proposed project would improve public
sector performance by helping the Government to implement a well-designed body
of policies, legislation and regulations concerning environmental conservation
and sustainable management of an important part of Venezuela's natural resource
base.   Significant gains would be made in biodiversity preservation and
sustainable management and protection of valuable natural resources. Important
benefits would also be generated, since many of Venezuela's parks protect natural
resources of high economic value, in particular vital watersheds. Private sector
involvement asd active NOO participation would be encouraged in project
implementation, and thereafter to ensure the economic sustainability of the
various protected areas. Finally, the project would have a modest, but positive,
impact on the well-being of poor populations living in the vicinity of the
national parks (new livelihood opportunities, technical support for sustainable
resource use, and improved environmental infrastructure).
6.        Poject Objectives.   The project would help to strengthen the
capability of INPARQUNS and other key public agencies involved in environmental
protection (SADAMAZONAS, PROFAUNA and PAC) to manage Venezuela's nationa and
urban parks, natural monuments, and wildlife refugea and reserves; to intensify
public environmontal research, train4ng and education efforts3 to involve the
private sector more actively in the management and protection of natural
resources; and to improve the financial sustainability of the national parks and
other protected areas.
7.        ProjOct Descrintion.  The main project components would includes
(a) Strenathenina of Parks ManagemeWt and Protection (US$58.9 million of baseline
costs) in 16 national parks in northern Venezuela, four national parks and two
natural monuments in the Amazon region, two wildlife refuges, and seven urban
parks and expansion of an effective fire prevention and combat capacity
throughout the park system; (b) Anried Znvironmental Regearch (US$6.4 million)
to support sustainable management of various parks, generate useful sclentific
knowledge on the ecology of the parks, and assist Venezuela in safeguarding its
rights with respect to research findings and the possible commercial use of its
biodiversity resources; (c) Publlc Znviro2nmtal Education (US$2. 5 million), both
at the regional and local levels, to disseminate information, raise the level of
knowledge about environmental issues and their linkages with economic
development, and engage the active participation of the community in supporting
environmental protection; and (d) lgtitut&"nal DUSlommnt (US$12.6 million),
including training, technical assistance and studies, physical infrastructure,
equipment, furniture and other incremental operational support for INPARQUDS and
other project institutions.



-3-
8.        The project would be implemented over a five-year period.  The total
project cost, including taxes, is estimated at US$96.0 million, with a foreign
exchange component of US$21.3 million. The Bank loan of US$S55.0 million would
finance the full foreign exchange component and 45% o" local costs; the
Government would finance the balance. Local cost financing is justified because
of the strong environmental focus of the project. Retroactive financing of up
to USS5.0 million is recommended to cover expenditures incurred from the
conclusion of project appraisal in July 1992 through loan signing. This would
permit early contracting of essential technical assistance specialists required
during the first year of the project, and tha start-up of priority protection
activities in selected parks. A breakdown of project costs and the financing
plan are shown in Schedule A.   Amounts and methods of procurement and
disbursements and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable
of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in
Venezuela are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A Map and the Staff
Appraisal Report No. 11208-VE are also attached.
9.        Imgmentation Arrancgmonts.  The Republic of Venezuela would be the
Borrower, and INPARQUES would be responsible for project coordination and
implementation of most project interventions. INPARQUES would sign Participation
Agreements with PROFAUNA, SADAMAZONAS and FAC for the execution of activities for
which these agencies have the expertise and legal responsibility. INPARQUES is
a well-established autonomous institution with a good track record to date, but
its present structure and skills do not fully reflect the extent to which its
responsibilities have grown over the years. Also, the proposed project would
itself place considerable demands on INPARQUES' administrative, financial and
technical capAbilities. To address these concerns, INPARQUBS would implement a
Decentralit4tion and Administrative Retorm Plan, which was developed during
project preparation and appraisal. Under the Plan, INPARQUES would decentralize
many of its technical and administrative functions, staffing, and special
programs (e.g., E1 Avila, Los Rogues, Guatopo), from its central headquarters to
its regional and state offices and field units.   The project would provide
extensive technical assistance and training, and the necessary physical
facilities, to implement the Plan.   NGOs and local communities would also
participate actively in all project components.
10.       Lessons Learned from Similar rr&iegts-  While many Bank projects
include onvironmental components, projects primarily in support of environmental
objectives are still few in number. Nonetheless, the Bank has drawn several
lessons based on these efforts and the experiences of parks programs in more
developed countries. Among them are the following: (a) effective implementation
of a national parks system requires significant on-the-ground management; over-
centralization of decision-making at national system headquarters results in poor
management at the fleld level and low capacity to react to environmental and
social changest (b) early and sustained involvement of local communities and
environmental NOos is critical to gain public support for environmental
conservation, to properly reflect sound local demands in park management plans,
and to enlist community and private sector support in sharing the costs of
conservation programs; and (c) althouCi national parks are the source of
important benefits for society (e.g., wa.ershed protection), the national park
admLnistrations normally capture few of the consequent revenues. Increasing
direct revenue collection from the public can help to Isolate the parks'



-4-
operational programs from national budget fluletuations. These lessons have been
taken !,nto account in the design of the proposed project.
II.       Aareements Raohed.   ConWiton. ogf Loan Effectiveness,  if not
completed earlier, would be: (L) the satisfactory establishment of a Project
Coordination Unit .n INPARQURS; (ii) the signing of satisfactory Participation
Agreements between IMPARQUES and the other project entities; (iii) approval by
MARNR of INPARQUES' Decentralization and Administrative Reform Plan; (iv)
establishment of A new IIPARQUES Capital Region Office; and (v) transfer by
INPARQUES of sele :ed special programs to its regional offices. Other Assurances
obtained include: (i) INPARQUES Decentralization and Administrative Reform Plan
and its Finance Plan would be satisfactorily implemented over the life of the
project; (1i) adequate counterpart funds would be made available to the project
in a timely manner, and annual plans and budget for each project year would be
made  available  to  the. Bank  in  advance  for  review  and  coements;  and
(iii) INPARQUES would hold joint annual supervision reviews with the Bank to
monitor progress against pre-defined performance indicators, beginning in 1993;
INPARQUES would invite an Independent Evaluation Committee, including relevant
mOOs, to monitor project progress and impact, and would make the results
available to the Bank by March 31 of each year, beginning in 1993; copies of
se.'s -annual progress reports would be sent to the Bank by March 31 and September
30 if each project yeart and a mid-term review would be carried out no later than
three years after the beginning of project implementation.
12.       Pogject Baenefits.   Support for national parke and other prior.ity
protected areas in Venezuela is justified from both a national and an
international standpoint. Many of ther areas contain the watersheds of major
rivers and storage reservoirs which are significant for power, agriculture and
water supply; and/or have recreational or tourism potential which could be
further developed provided their natural resource base is protected and managed
in a sustainable manner. By way of illustration, the present value of the
watershed protection function of the national parks, in terms of hydroelectric
generation and urban water supply alone, has been estimated at US$285 million
p.a. or more, a significant share of which could be lost in the absence of proper
management and protection of these parks. As a direct result of the project, the
management and protection of a total are& of approximately 110,000 knm would be
significantly improved. The capacity to manage all of Venezuela's protected
areas (some 0.5 million km2) would also be strengthened as a result of the
training, public education and institutional capacity building activities of the
project. From the international perspective, despite its relatively small size,
the investment effort under the project would greatly enhance the prospects for
survival of representative samples of a significant share of the world's tropical
and neotropical biological diversity and would thus also have important external
benefits.
13.        ua4taingabIit*. Although national parks and other protected areas are
the source of important economic benefits for Venezuelan society, few of these
benefits are captured by INPARQUES. For that reason, like many other national
park administrations, INPARQUZS depends heavily on government budget
appropriations, which has obvious drawbacks when fiscal problems arise. Although
ther has been a modest growth in revenues from other sources over the past few
years, this was almost entirely offset by decreases in official budgetary



- 5 -
allocations. Total annual budget allocations required during the project period
would be about US$15.5 million; this represents a 508 increase over previous
years, but is not expected to cause problems an this would still be an extremely
small share of the total central government budget. However, to diversify its
sources of funds and thereby improve its longer-torm financial sustainability,
INPARQUES has developed a Financial Plan which would be implemented under the
pxoject. The main elements of the plan include: (a) the charging of entry fees
in heavily visited parks which still do not collect them and increasing of fees
in oarks which already do collect them; (b) the assessment of charges for other
activities which depend substantially on the conservation of natural resources
within the national parks system (e.g., commercial fishing and tourist companies'
licenses, hotel taxes and water users' fees) and fees for the use of park lands
by governmental or private parties; and (c) strengthening of INPARQUES' financial
planning and fund raising capacity.
14.       Porieot Risks. Although there are no major project risks, execution
could be affected by some institutional weaknesses of IMPARQUES and counterpart
funding constraints. To address institutional concerns, the project would assist
INPARQUES to carry out its Decentralization and Administrative Reform Plan (para.
9), and the financial strengthening measures in para. 13 above. Substantial
technical assistance and staff training would be provided to support these
efforts; terms of reference for the most critical specialists were agreed during
appraisal and their recruitment is already underway by INPARQUES. Also, building
on successful past collaborative efforts, domestic and international NGOs and
local communities would participate in various project activities, thereby
lessening some of the implementation burden on INPARQUES. Finally, the project
strategy places primary emphasis on the contracting out of projedt works to the
maximum extent possible. With regard to funding, the level of cost sharing by
the Bank would be somewhat higher (60%) than the average for other operations in
Venezuela because of the strong environmental focus of the project.   At
negotiations, the Government provided evidence that adequate counterpart funds
for the first year of the project had been included in the draft 1993 budget, and
assurances were obtained that the Government would provide adequate and timely
counterpart funds to meet the balance of project funding ujseds.
15.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the loan.
