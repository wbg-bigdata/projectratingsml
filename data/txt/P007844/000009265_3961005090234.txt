MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE PRESIIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSRUCTION AND
DEVELOPMET
TO THE EXECUTIVE D)ECTORS
ON A LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF PANAMA
FOR THE ROADS REHABIfTATION PROJECT
1.   I submit for your apprval the following memorandum and recommendation on a
proposed loan to the Republic of Panama for US$60 million equivalent to help the
Govermment of Panama implement its Road Rebabilitation Progam. The loan would be
repaid over 17 years, including a 5 year grace pertiod, with interest at the Bank's variable
rate. The project will be cofinanced by the Inter-American Development Bank (1DB), which
has already approved a loan in an amount equivalent to US$180 miLlion. The two banks
worked closely together on the project's preparation and appraisal and the IDB's Project
Document No. PN-0022 has been distributed to you in lieu of the Bank's Staff Appraisal
Report.
2.    Background. Panama has a relatively well-developed transport infrastructue for both
international and domestic transport. However, due to inadequate maintenance and higher
than anticipated traffic volumes and loads, its roads, streets and bridges have badly
deteriorated. In 1985, about 74% of Panama's roads were estimated to be in fair to good
condition; currently this figure is only about 40%. This deterioration resulted from very little
maintenance funding, average of about USS5 million per annum, during the 1980s when the
country's economic growth ground to an almost complete halt, due first to the slow down in
economic activity in Latin America generally and later to the economic sanctions imposed
against Panama. Over the past three years, maintenance funding has picked up again to about
US$ 16 million per year on average. However, about US$80 million per year would be
required over the next five years to remove the backlog of maintenance and to prvent its
future accumulation. Of particular concern is the ongoing rapid deterioration of the
Tlansisthmian Highway and stretches of the Pan American Highway, by far the country's
two most important land transport axes and traditionally the main corridors crucial to
Panama's economic development. The Panama City Metropolitan Area (PCMA) dominates
the political, economic and social activities of the country, with over 40% of its total
population, 44% of its work force and over 50% of GDP. PCMNs physical layout and
spatial development have led to long travel distances concentrated mostly in a narrow
corridor along the Transisthmian Highway and resulting in unacceptably high levels of traffic
congestion, PCMAs transport problems are further aggravated by an inefficient bus transport
system, inadequate traffilc management and insufficient maintenance of city streets.
3.    The present Government has taken several significant initiatives since 1989 to
improve the roads subsector. Maintenance funding has been gradually increased; a more
appropriate law governing vehicle weights and dimensions has been passed and its policing
has been intensified to save the country's road infastructure; a beginning has been made to
reduce the redundancy in the Ministry of Public Works (MOP) by cutting staff by about 20
per cent; MOP has been reorganized to streamline its functions and make it mainly a
normaive agency. relying more on the private sector, through both consultants and
contractors, to carry out its former construction activities; plans are underway to sell off
most of MOP's road and quarry equipment and to resume staff reductions as the above shift
to the private sector continues; an evironmental unit has been established in MOP to give



2
greater attention to environmental impact assessments; and a iew Urban Passenger TSansport
Law (UPIL) has been passed to improve efficiency in this critically important area.
4.    Panama has no ministry or agency responsible for intennodal transport investnent and
policy coordination. The transport subsector agencies - the National Port Authority (APN),
the Panama Railways (PP), the Civil Aviation Department and the MOP for highvways -
establish their own investment programs, strategies and policies, and report to different
ministries. Ib better coordinate among the different modes of transport and, as a first step
towards the eventual creation of a single sector entity, which would be responsible for
overall coordination, policy, strategy formulation, and regulation of the transport sector, the
project would pwvide for the establishment of a lbnsport Planning and Coordination Unit.
5.    Responsibility for the management of the urban transport subsector is divided between
MOP and the Ministty of Government and JustiL  (MGJ). MOP's role is that of planning,
design, construction supervision and maintenance of the physical infrastmcture as well as
traffic managerent. Overseeing and policing urban passenger transport services is the
responsibility of MGJ. It also assigns certificates of operation (cupos) permitting entry into
the market, assigns routes and sets tariffs and manages and polices traffic. The project would
prvide technical assistance to both MOP and MGJ to strengthen their capacity to cany out
these functions, as recently defined in the new UPIT of May 26, 1993, and to train staff.
6.    The truckdng industry in Panama is, for the most part, free of inefficient regulations.
However, for ttucking to add from the Colon Free Zone, some trucking cooperatives,
uions, lare trucking companies in agreement with the Admministator of the Colon Free
Zone do, in fact, restrict entry into the market leading to a doubling of tariffs compared to
those of international freight handled by non-Panamanian truckers to the Free Zone. Under
the project, these rstrictions would be eliminated.
7.    Bus passenger transport in Panama is provided mostly by private operators who come
under the regulatory authority of MG   In Panama City, most operators own a single vehicle
and their entry and route assignments are controlled by the "cupo system", which is a
common practice in Latin America. The new UPL unprowes the cupo systm by requiring
cupo holders to show evidence of vehicle ownership and by strengtbening the Government's
authoity to revoke cupos. The project would provide technical assistance to identify what
further changes may be needed in the cupo system to minimize distortions and to implement
the ,hanges.
8.    Project Objectives. The project aims to: (a) increase competition in the mad
transport industry and provide the foundation for futne, regulatory reform; 0) improve the
management of the tansport sector through through the coordination of imvestments and the
formulation of policies; (c) continue strengthening the   istrion and maintenance of
roads, through support to MOP in: (i) pavement management; and (ii) private sector
participation in road maintenance; (d) assist the MOP in removing the existing road
maintenance backlog and preventing its future occurrence through the implementation of a
well-coordinated rehabilitation and maintenance program; and (e) reduce the traic
congestion and provide more efficient, safe and reliable passenger transport services in the
city of Panama and other major cities in the country.

9.    Project Description. The project, which would finance a four-year (1994-1997) time
slice of GOPs publicly-financed Road Program satis1actory to the Bank, would comprise: (1)
an urban transrt co1m pnent (US$89 million of project base costs) covering: (a) street
.ehabilitation and/or widening and maintenance, intersection improvement, improved
signazation and traffic management; and (b) institutional reforms and regulatoxy changes in
public road transport; (2) an inter-urban roads component (US$278 million total cost)
comprising: the improvement, rehabilitation and maintenance of roads and bridges; and (3) _
oligy reform and an institutional strengthening component (US$8 million total cost) aimed
at: (a) refonning the regulatory policy of the for-hire road transport services; (b) improving
overall transport sector planning and policy formulation, the institutional set-up for managing
urban tansport, and MOP's capacity to coordinate investments in the entire transport sector
and to address environmental issues; (c) training MOP staff to prepare projects for private
sector implementation and to manage the contracts; and (d) preparing studies for possible
follow-up activities. The other elements of the total Road Program are justifiable road
upgrading and improvement investments, which the Government intends to cany out mostly
under build, operate and tansfer (BOT) arrangements with the private sector. The
Government would use the same technical, economic and environmental criteria to select and
implement those roads.
10.  Project Costs and Flnancing Plan. The project is estimated to cost about US$406
million, including contingencies. The Government would finance US$166 million, the IDB,
US$180 million, including US$31 million of financial charges on its loan, and the Bank,
US$60 millon. Both banks would finance parts of the urban and inter-urban components of
the project as wel as specific technical assistance activities. No individual contact would be
financed by both the Bank and the DB. Fimancing of routine maintenance would be covered
entirely by the Government, except for a pilot program of about US$500,000 to assist in
introducing routine maintenance by contract to the private scztor. Retroactive financing of
about US$4.0 million is recommended to cover expenditures incurred after June 30, 1993 for
civil works to be initiated during the construction season and for consulting services
necessary for project start up, in line with a similar agreement reached between the
Government and 1DB. The detailed cost estmates and financing plan are siown in
Schedule A.
11. Project Implementation. Implemenlation of the project is expected to take six years
from March 1994. Execution of the road works, technical assistance for sector coordination
and strengthening of MOP and the study of truckdng in the Free Zone, would be the
responsibility of MOP, which would carry out the activities through its national directorates.
MOP would create and staff a five-person Special Project Coordination Unit (UECP), to
coordinate project implementation activities, including the preparation and submission of
project reports and bidding documents. The project would provide a training program to
MOP focussing on contrct management to assist in implementing the project. MGJ would be
responsible for: the review of the effectiveness of the new trsport law in improving the
quality of urban public passenger transport, the review of public bus tansport tarffs and
technical assistance and training for MGJ staff. All subprojects would be selected in
accordance with technical, economic, financial and environmental criteria satisfctory to the
Bank. These criterna as well as further details on proj'- implementation and specific acdons
and their mming are given !n the Government's Implementation Letter. The Government's
overall sector stategy is speLed out in the Government's Thnsport Sector Plicy Statement.
The Bank's Standard Bidding Documents would be used for the procurement of civil works



4
and goods and the engagement of consultants. A Special Account would be established in the
'3anco Nacional de Panama or any other commercial bank acceptable to the Bank with an
initial deposit of US$3.(0 million. A Revolving Fund for the project's counterpart funds
would also be established with an initial amount of UTS$2.0 million in the Banco Nacional de
Panama or any other commercial bank acceptable to the Bank. Methods of procurement and
disbursements are shown in Schedule B and detailed in Annex 2. Schedule C presents the
timetable of key project processing events and Schedule D, the status of Bank Group
operations in Panama.
12.   Project Sustainability. The project's focus on refonns in the policy and regulatory
faxmeworks goveniing the road transport industry and on institutional development, aimed at
better managing the highways subsector, should contribute to the project's sustainability. The
implementation of the recommendations of the highway subsector financing study is expected
to lead to a more reliable funding source for the subsector, and ensure adequate road
maintenance and rehabilitation.
13.   Lessons From Bank Experience in the Sector. The Bank has played a significant
role in the development of the transport sector in Panama with four highway projects, two
port projects, an aviation project, a Panama Corridor Thnsport Study, and the UNDP-
financed National lTansport Study, for which the Bank was the executing agency. The Bank-
financed projects, in general, have achieved their principal objectives. Physical
implementation in all cases, however, was delayed by frequent changes in project
management, a shortage of qualified and experienced staff, lack of counterpart funds and
differences between the Government and the Bank on procurement procedures as well as
their cumbersome nature. The design of the proposed project draws heavily on this
experience and provides specific measures aimed at preventing their occurrence, namely: (a)
technical assistance for organizational support and staff; (b) annual and mid-term reviews of
budgets and the establishment of a Revolving Fund to ensure liquidity; and (c) use of the
Banks Standard Bidding Documents.
14.   Rationale for Bank Involvement. The Bank is supporting GOP's economic reform
program thlough the on-going Economic Recovery Loan. The Bank's medium-term country
assistance stategy is to foster a deepening of the reform agenda through deregulation of the
domestic economy, improving efficiency and management in the public sector, alleviating
poverty and improving efficiency and equity in the d-elivery of social services, rehabilitng
basic infmstructure and safeguarding the environment. In the transport sector, the above
strategy implies: (a) carrying out the necessary policy reforms to improve the efficiency of
the road transport industry; (b) improving transport sector planning and policy fonnulation
and increasing the participation of the private sector to improve efficiency in the provision of
transport services; and (c) concentrating on selected investments, particularly in improving
the country's urban and interurban road systems. The Bank's involvement, jointly with the
IDB, in the proposed project is essential for effecting and sustaining important improvements
in the above three areas. The Bank's imnolvement has been, and would continue to be,
catalytic in helping the Government bnng about the necessary changes.
15.   Agreed Actions. During Negotiations, agreement was reached with the Government
on a policy and institutional reform program, incorporated in its Transport Sector Policy
Statement and Implementation Letter (Annex 1). The agreements include: (a) a review by
June 30, 1996 (about 30 months after the anticipated date of loan signature) of the



5
effectiveness of the new UPL, particularly the effectiveness of the cupo system, and
implementation of the agreed recommendations by September 30, 1996 before the Bank's
appioval of the following year's road program; (b) discussions of the Free Zone study with
the Bank following its completion and implementation of the recommendations by September
30, 1996, as a condition of Bank approval of further annual road programs; (c) a review of
urban public passenger transport tariffs by December 30, 1995 and implementation of the
new tariffs by June 30, 1996; (d) the establishment of a Dmnsport Sector Investment and
Policy Coordination entity; (e) the adoption of technical, ecanomic ant environmental criteria
for selecting and implementing investments in the Road Program (detailed in Annex 2); (f)
the structure, staffing, functions and strengthening of the envirormental uidt (Annex 2); (g)
the functions and responsibilities of the UECP (Annex 2); (h) dhe provision -f adequate
counterpart and road maintenance funding iy the Government (Annex 1); vi) the list of
investments to be included in the first-year program (Annex 2); (j) the scope of the annual
and mid-term reviews together with specific Progress and Performance Indicators (Annex 2);
(k) the environmental guidelines for MOP's activities, to be reviewed and approved by the
Bank not later than December 31, 1994 and issued immediately thereafter; and ,l) the use of
the Bank's standard bidding documents for procurenvent of civil works and goods and of the
Bank's guidelines for the recruitment of consultants and of agreed standard documents for
Local Competitive Bidding.
16.   Conditions of Effectiveness. The conditions of loan effectiveness would be: (a) the
Goverment would create a permanent entity for overall coo:Jination of investments and
policy in the transport sector, with staling and functions acceptable to the Bank; (b) the
Government would create and satisfactorily staff the UECP; and (c) the Government would
establish and make an initial deposit of US$2 million into the Revolving Account.
17.   Environmental Aspects. MOP has established an environmental unit which would be
strengthened under the project both through the recruitment of additional staff and through
stafF aining. By March 31, 1995, the Governnent would staff the unit with qualified
personnel, and provide equipment and sufficient funds to operate it. The project roads and
streets would be subject to environmental impact studies. Where the studies indicate that
mitigatory measures are needed, these would be undertaken before the works are approved
for financing. The bidding documents for the project works would include mitigatory
measures for direct adverse envionmenal impacts expected to be caused by roadwork
activities such as quarrying, opening of borrow pits, disposal of used road materials and
temporary work camps. FBor the Quebrada Aguacate-CaAitas-Bayano Rr'd, which the
Government intends to include in the Road Program, works would not start on the road until:
(i) a satisfactory Indigenous Peoples' Development Plan (IPDP), as required by OD 4.20, has
been completed by the Govermment and agreed with the Bank and (ii) agreed mitigatory
actions identified as being necessary before the beginning of construction have been carried
out. Also, while there are currently no known project components that would require
resettlement, the Government would have the right to adjust the road progran during
implementation and include resettlement components. The Government would fiurnish to the
Bank a satisfactory resettlement and compensation plan before initiatn any project
components requinng resettlement. While the MOP is developing the environmental
guidelines indicated in pargraph 15 above it would use the Bank and IDE guidelines,
respectively.

18.   Benefits. Tihe project would improve transport efficiency and reduce costs throughout
the country, particularly along the PanAmerican Highway, which is needed for the transport
of agricultural produce, and in the PCMA, where it would support the intemationally-
oriented service sector and urban industry. In addition, the project would prolong the
economic life of existing badly deteriorated roads and streets thereby helping to avoid costly
premature reconstruction. The project's policy reforn component would ensure more
efficient for-hire road transport service and lead to lower transport costs and better quality of
service. A high percentage of the beneficiaries of the improved efficiency in urban bus
transport would be th.. lower income urban group. Significant, but unquantifiable, benefits
would also accrue from the institutional strengthening and training components of the project.
The improvement in investment coordination would avoid gaps, wasteful duplication and
badly timed investments. The assistance for strengthening MOP would increase its
implementation efficiency and reduce delays. The improvement in environmental awareness
and the capacity to take environmental factors into account in the design and execution of
road projects would prevent damage to the country's natural resources.
19.   Risks. The main project risk is that the Govemment might be unwilling or unable to
take difficult policy decisions. Up-front actions, such as the creation of the sector
coordination unit as a condition of effectiveness, annual and mid-term reviews with well-
defined and measurable objectives and a mechanism for withholding the approval of
subsequent amual sector investment programs, if the key policy and institutional reforms are
not met, would help to reduce risks. To provide for likely staff changes and reassignments
that might result from the transfer of power to a new Govemment in September 1994, only
the key technical assistance positions necessary for project start-up would be filled before this
date and staff training would be initially limited primarily to mid-level staff who are unlikely
to be affected by the change in Government. Other risks relate to possible capacity
limitations, both financially and institutionally, to implement the project. To reduce this
risk, the fbur-year program would be programmed for implementation in six years. Also,
maximum use would be made of private consultants and contractors, both local and
international. Finally, to ensure adequate counterpart financing, the Government, in its
Transport Sector Policy Statement, has committed itself to provide satisfactory funds in the
annual budgets.
20.   Recomnendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors approve the
proposed project.

PANAMA
ROADS REE[ABILffATION PROJECT
Transport Sector Policy Statement and Action Plan
1.    The Government of Panama has submitted a Tiansport Sector Policy Statement and
Action Plan to the Bank. The salient features of the statement, which outlines the transport
sector's needs and the Government's objectives, policies, and strategy, are presentud below.
2.    The principal objectives of the Government's transport sector policy are:
For the Tansport Sector in General
(a)   to reduce the direct involvement of Government in transport sector operations
and activities and to increase the participation of the private sector;
(b) to increase the efficiency of the sector's agencies and to ensure the financial
autonomy of the revenue-earing agencies through, inter alia, adequate cost-
recovery and increased productivity; and
(c)   to rationalize the management of the transport sector as a whole, especially the
coordination of the sector's investments, policies and regulations.
For the Roads Subsector
(a)   to remove adverse economic regulations from the road transport industly and
to foster efficiency through inproved competition;
(b) to increase the private sector's participation in carrying out road and bridge
works, including studies, engineering, supervision and work exution;
(c)   to rehabilitate the road network and maintain it adequately;
(d)   to ensure adequate cost-recovery and funding for road rehabilitation and
maintenance and network management;
(e)   to strengthen MOP's capacity, especially for procurement and contract
management, road traffic management and safety, overseeing the trucking
industry, road maintenance management and road plnning; and
(f)   to strengthen MOP's capacity to integrte environmental work with its other
activities.
3.    Private Sector Inmolvement: The Government is reviewing and assisting in
privatization in the ports, railways and civil aviation subsectors. Grovernment is analyzing
bids from the prvate sector fior container handling at both the Cristobal and Balboa ports. In
the highways subsector, Govermment has already increased substantially the use of
consultants and private contmactors.



16
4.    Efficiency and Financial Autonomy: The Government, since coming to power in
1988, has made strong attempts to streamline the operations of the National Port Authority,
the Panama Railways, MOP and the Civil Aviation Department by reducing staff and
operating costs in an effort to improve financial autonomy. The Government is actively
seeking further efficiency and financial autonomy through the abovementioned involvement
of the private sector through various schemes, including outright private ownership; build,
operate and transfer (BCI) arrangements; and management and operation of faci}lties via
concessions.
5.    Sector Manaement: The Government recognizes the need to improve the
coordination of sector investments, policy and regulations and intends to study the best
institutional arrangements for this. The proposed project would finance the study and the
implementation of its recommendations (see Action Plan attached).
6.    Ro:ads         The Government's objectives and actions required to implement its
policy for the roads subsector are outlined in the attached Action Plan Matrix for Policy
Reform and Institutional Strengthening. The Govermnent attaches particular importance to
three areas: the project's counterpart funding and funding of the maintenance of the road and
city streets network; the strategy for institutional strengthening of MOP; and the planned
systematic substitution of pnvate contractors for MOP's force account in the execution of
road maintenance.
7.    Enndjng: The Govenment would carry out, under the proposed project, a study of
altemative mechanisms for financing the roads subsector and then implement the study's
recommendations. In the meantime the Govemment would make the counterpart and
maintenance funds available in its budget. The Government would make the following
minimum amounts available:
Year              Goverment                Countepart          Maintenance
Contribution            EPnds                     Fun«ds

1995              40.2                    19.0                       21.2
1996              39.4                    18.5                       20.9
1997              39.0                    18.1                       20.9
1998              39.0                    18.1                       20.9
1999              38.5                    17.6                       20.9
The Government plans furthermore to implement the recommendations of the proposed road
financing study.
8.    Stiategy of lechnical Assistance to MOP: The Government recognizes the need to
strengthen MOP to meet its newly-defined role and intends to accomplish this through filling
key vacancies, augmenting MOP's capacity through techaical assistance and training staff. Tb
provide for likely staff changes and reassignment that might result from the transfer of power
to a new Govermment in September 1994, only the key technical assistance positions
necessary for project start-up would be filled before October 1994 and staff training would be



17
initially limited to mid-level staff who are unlikely to be affected by the change of
government.
9.    Maintenance by Contract: The Government intends to systematically substitute private
contractors for MOP force account in the execution of roads and bridge maintenance. Tb
ensure the smooth efficient introduction of this approach, the project would provide for: (a)
technical assistance to assist in expanding the private sector's role; and (b) the
implementation of a pilot progmam of routine maintenance by contract. The Government has
set the following targets for the private sector participation:

ANNEX 2
PANAMA
ROADS REHABILITATION PROJECr
Project Implementation, Supervision Strategy, Environmental Considerations,
Procurement Procedures and Disbursements
Project Implementation
1.    First-year subprojects were selected during appraisal and confirmed during
negotiations (see Attachment 1). Implementation of the project works, expected to take six
years starting from March 1994, would be the responsibility of MOP through its various
national directorates (see Attachment 2). The study for rationalization of transport sector
management would be supervised by MIPPE and the review of the urban transport law, the
technical assistance to the National Department of Traffic and Land ITansport (DNTI) and
the road safety program would be the responsibility of MGI. The project would be
coordinated by a Special Project Coordination Unit (UECP) to be created in MOP, in its
Directorate of Progamming and Institutional Development (DIPRODI). The UECP would
have a Project Coordinator, three engineers (two for the IDB component and one for the
Bank component) and an accountant/administative officer. The UECP would be responsible
for coordinating the implementation of all project components, including those to be
implemented by MGJ and MIPPE, preparing semi-annual progress reports and coordinating
the prparation of the documentation for the annual and mid-term reviews. The UECP
would assist the Minister of MOP in its communications with the Bank. Full staffing of the
UECP, satisfhctory to the Bank, would be a condition of loan effectiveness.
2.    Successful implementation of the urban transport component would depend heavily
upon close cooperation and coordination between MOP's DINATRATE and MGJ's DNTr.
Such coordination would be facilita'-d by the recently signed Interninisterial Agreement
between MOP and MGJ Any substantial changes in this arrangement would be discussed
and agreed with the Bank.
Selection Criteria
3.    To ensure the technical, economical, financial and environmental feasibility of the
individual subprojects included in the total Road Program, the subprojects would satisfy the
following criteria:
(i)   must belong to the network managed by MOP;
(ii)   must be evaluated and selected based on criteria presented to the Bank, including a
detailed investment cost estimate;
(iii) should consist of the appropriate maintenance, rehabilitation, reconstruction or
improvement warranted by the condition of the road or bridge, restoring the existing
pavement surface and structures to their original condition or improving them to
satisfictory levels from technical, economical and environmental view points;
(iv)  must have an economic rate of retum of at least 12 percent;



24
(v)   must include the necessary measures to prevent and/or mitigate any possible negative
impacts that they may cause to the environment, following guidelines agreed with the
Bank; and
(vi)  should, in the case of access roads, enable nural communities to access markets or
storage centers; must prevent and/or mitigate any possible negative impacts that they
may cause to the environment, particularly protected areas or forests, following
guidelines agreed with the Bank; and must guarantee the maintenance of the works.
4.    lb ensure the technical, economical, financial and environmental feasibi1ity of the
individual subprojects included in the proposed Project, the following selection criteria must
be met:
(i)   subprojects must follow criteria (i), (iii), (iv), (v) and (vi) above;
(ii)  acquisition of the required right of way for any subproject and any necessary
resettlement involved must have taken place and must follow appropriate Bank
guidelines;
(iii)  in the case of interurban subprojects, they must be evaluated and selected using the
Banl's Highway Design and Maintenance Standards-m (RPM-HI) Model or an
alternative model acceptable to the Bank; and
(iv)  in the case of urban subprojects, they must belong to the list of subprojects
contemplated in the updated Urban Transport Five-Year Plan.
Sutpemvision Strategy
S.    MOP would submit semi-annual reports to the Bank, by June 30 and December 31 of
each year for the previous semester. The implementing agencies would prepare progress and
completion reports for their respective components. lhe ,UECP would be responsible for the
physical and financial monitoring of project activities and would coordinate preparation of all
reports and consolidate them for submission to the Bank. The Government would also
submit to the Bank a project completion report not later than six months after the closing
date of the loan.
6.    No later than September 30 of each year staring September 30, 1994, the Bank, IDB
and the Government would conduct formal Ieviews of progress made in implementing the
project. These annual reviews would be used to evaluate the annual investment plan and
budget for the following year, and the Enancial projections of MOP, as well as to assess
project performance, as detailed in the Supervision Plan (see Attachments 3, 4 and 5).
7.    By September 30, 1996 (about 30 months after loan signature), the Bank and the
Govemment would conduct a mid-term review of project execution. In addition to covering
all the areas included in the annual reviews, the mid-term review will be used to assess the
performance on: (a) implementation of necessaxy changes in the urban passenger transport
law; (b) the freeing of trucking in the free zone; and (c) the improvement of sector planning
and policy coordination. A more detailed description of the actions and indicators to be
evaluated during the mid-term review is presented in the Supervision Plan (Attachment 3).

Studies. 3Thhnical Assistance and ItaininW
8.    The project's institutional component is summarized in Attachment 6. Government's
agreement to it was confirmed at negotiations. The terms of reference (included in the
Project File) for the proposed studies and technical assistance (see Attachment 6), agreed
with Government at appraisal were confirmed at negotiations. The new Government, which
is expected to take office in October 1994, may propose changes in the insdtutional
strengthening component as well as reassign some senior staff. Therefore, to the extent
possible, the schedule of implementation of the technical assistance and raining components
would make allowance for the new Govenment to have an input before major effort is
expended. Also, to reduce the risk of tmaining efforts being lost, training before October 1994
would be restricted to courses aimed at mid-level staff who are unlikely to be affected by the
change of Government.
9.    The project would include three major training elements (Attachment 7): (a) overseas
training, which includes attendance to courses, workshops, conferences and seminars and
out-of-country technical visits; the project would provide funds for travel, subsistence and
course inscription fees; (b) local training, which includes courses, workshops, conferences
and seminars organized by MOP with local or expatriate instructors or pxesenters; the project
would fund oranization costs and expatriate fees, travel and subsistence; and (c) overseas
scholarships and twinning arrangements.
10.   The following areas of overseas taining would be emphasized (Attachment 7): (a)
highways management geared to road authority-type organization; (b) contract (maintenance)
management; (c) pavement management; (d) maintenance management; (e) road
rehabilitation; (f) HDM; (g) highways safety; (h) environment and highways; (i) effective
utilization of computers; and 0) training.
11. Local training in the form of workshops and short-duration training courses would be
organized by MOP's Tmining Division with the assistance of a local or expatriate training
specialist and a local or expatriate expert in the field of taining. The following areas of
training would be emphasized (numbers in brackets indicate number of courses to be
administered): (a) procurement of civil wors (4); (b) contract management (4); (c) modem
road construction, rehabilitation and maintenance techniques (2); (d) HDM appLhcations (6);
bridge inspection and maintenance (4); (e) environment and highways (8); (f) highways safet
(4); (g) effective utilizaion of computers (8); and (h) effective taining (4).
12.   The project would also provide for short-term (not more than six months per course)
overseas training/twinning in overseas highways departments, highways institutes and
universities in various courses (Attachment 7), including: (a) traffic engineering and
transportation planning; (b) environment and highways; (c) highways safety; (d) contract
administration; and (e) highways administration.
13. During loan negotiations, the Government agreed to implement the above training
program. Furthermore, to ensure clear understanding on the areas of traing and numbers
of staff to be trained, the tmaining component outlined in Attachment 7 would be included as
an anmex of the loan documents and made an important element of the annual and mid-term
reviews. MOP has a capable training unit and sufficient physical facilities to carry out the
Project's in-house training activities.



26
anvironmental Considerations
14.   The project roads and streets in the total Road Program would be subjected to
environmental impact screening and, if appropriate, full environmental assessment (EA)
studies; studies for roads to be worked on during the first year of the project have been
completed. MOP is currently developing envirnmental guidelines for its activities. The
guidelines should include: (a) specific functions of the Environmental Unit (UA), indicating
those points in MOPs internal cycle where the UA would be expected to provide input, such
as initial environmental screening, drffting terms of rference for EA studies, approval of
EA studies, ensuring that project-specific environmental requirements are incorporated within
the bidding documents, and field supervision of environmentally sigificant road works; (b)
criteria and procedures for initial environmental screening to determine which road
subprojects require detailed EA studies, some additional environmental review or no further
environmental review; and (c) environmental mules for contractors, including standard
requirements, such as prohibitions on irresponsible waste disposal, and requirements tailored
for each contract, such as acceptable locations of borrow pits or disposal areas. The
guidelines would cover three principal environmental aspects: (a) physical/chemical
(hazardous substances, noise, vibration, air and water pollution), (b) biological (bio diversity,
ecosystems, wild lands, habitat), and (c) social (involuntay and unplanned resettlement,
indigenous peoples, cultural property, aesthetics, etc.). The guidelines would be submitted to
the Bank and the IDB for their review and approval not later than December 31, 1994, and
would be issued immediately thereafter.
15.   One of the wads in the Goverment's total Road Progm, the Quebrada Aguacate-
Canitas-Bayano Road, would facilitate access to a proposed indigenous reserve. Even though
the road is not slated for financing by either the IDB or the Bank, agreement would be
sought that no works would be started on the road until: (i) a satisfactory Indigenous
Peoples' Development Plan (IPDP) has been completed by the Government; and (ii) agreed
mitigatory actions identified as being necessary beFore construction have been carried out.
Additionally, for any subproject which may require resettlement, an agreement would be
sought that the Govermnent would furnish to the Bank a satisfactory rsetlement and
compensation plan beiore that subproject is initiated.
16. MOP's UA has been made responsible for the environmental screening of subprojects,
using guidelines under preparaton in MOP. This screening would indicate whether a
subproject needs further environmental study and the appropriate level of that study.
Evidence of this envionmental screening and the results of BA studies will be submitted to
the Bank, along with technical and economic evaluations, for every proposed subproject. A
summary of BA study results and proposed mitigatory measures should accompany the
materials provided to the Bank before each annual project review, and prior to receiving the
required no objection to each subproject. The Government would be required to staff the
UA with qualified personnel, and provide equipment and sufficient funds to operate it by
March 31, 1995.
17.   A key element of the institutional development component for MOP would be the
institutional strengthening of UA, which comprises: (i) technical assistance, and (ii)
environmental studies, (iii) training, and (iv) equipment. The technical assistance envisioned
would:



27
(i)   assist in producing environmental guidelines for MOP's activities, which should
satisfy the requirements of both the IDB and the Bank;
(ii)  assist the Environmental Unit in the environmental planning and screening of projects,
environmental management of road works and dissemination of environmental
guidelines, regulations and manuals;
(iii) provide on-the-job training for MOP's environmental staff and assist in designing a
proam for further training; and
(iv)  review MOP's existing portfolio of roads and assist in the recruitment of qualified
consultants to carry out environmental studies of any controversial subproject.
Procument EMr res
18.   Procurement of goods and civil works for the components financed by the Bank
would be done in accordance with Bank Guidelines for Procurement (May 1992 version).
The contracting of consulting services would be done in accordance with the Bank's
Guidelines for the Use of Consultants (August 1981 version). lb the extent possible, the
procurement of goods and works would be done by grouping the various equipment/material
items or constnuction jobs in bid packages estimated to cost the equivalert of US$100,000
and US$500,000 or more per package, respectively, in order to enhance the interest of
suppliers/contractors to bid. Such packages would be procured through ICB procedures, in
accordance with Bank Guidelines. All procurement of goods and civil works under ICB
would be done using the Bankes standard bidding documents Bidders for works and goods
estimated to cost more than the equivalent of US$1,000,000 and US$200,000, respectively,
would be prequaified in accordance with Bank Guidelines.
19.   Civil works valued at less than US$500,000 per package or contract and not
eeding US$l .0 million in aggregate would be procured through LCB procedures
satisfactory to the Bank, using standard bidding documents agreed by the Bank.
20.   Contracts for vehicles estimated to cost less than US$200,000 in total would be
awarded through limited interational bidding (LI) procedures in accordance with Bank
guidelines, from suppliers that can provide maintenance and servicing in Panama. Contracts
for equipment valued at less than US$25,000 each, up to an aggregate amount of
US$300,000, would be awarded following local/international shopping prcedures
satisfactory to the Bank. The following table details the procurement methods to be used
under the project.
21. All contracts for goods estimated to cost US$100,000 or more, all contracts for works
estimated to cost US$500,000 or more, and the first LIB contract and the first LCB contracts
for works in each category as per Schedule A, would be subject to the Bank's prior review.
Consulting agreements with firms estimated to cost US$100,000 or more and contracts with
individual consultants would also be subject to the Bank's prior review. For consulting
contracts with fiEms valued at less than US$100,000 and not exceeding US$2.0 million in
aggregate, the Bank will review ex-ante the corresponding terms of reference, and ex-post,
during supervision, the relevant supporting documentation.

22.   A Country Procurement Assessment of Panama recently concluded by the Bank
con. 'ded that the Govennent's present procurement procedures differ in significant
repects from the Bank's, as partally indicated below:
(i)    For serviees: (a) Panama's C6digo Fiscal (Fiscal Code) requires that proposals be
submitted in person by a local representative of the firm, effectively requirng foreign
firms to associate themselves or enter into a joint venture with local firms; and (b)
bidders must present a "certificado de postore (legal capacity for the purpose of
submitting a bid), clearing their legal capacity to bid and their tax status.
(ii)    For pcurment of goods and civil works: (a) proposals must be received only within
one hour of bid opening and must be presented in person by the bidder or his/her
epresentative; (b) bids must be in local currency (Balboa); (c) the Codigo Fiscal
specifies that bid security cannot be presented in some of the forms allowed by Bank's
procedures, such as leters of credit; (d) the bids must be presented on specially-
stamped sheets; (e) the winning bid is the one found "most fihorable" to the
Govermnent, rather than the lowest evaluated bid; (f) a provisional winner must be
announced at bid opening; and (g) rebidding is mandatory in the case of only one
evaluated bid.
(iii) For procurement of goods: transportation, maintenance and operating costs;
performance; and productivity cannot be used as additional factors in the evaluation of
bids.



29
Covenants in the loan agreement will specifically address each of the observed differences,
such as those cited above, to ensure that Bank procedures are followed.
23.   Article 38 of the C6digo Fiscal indirectly recognizes the precedence of the
procurement procedures of intemnational institutions over Panamanian legislation for
intemationally-funded civil works. The Govermment issued a Regulation before negotiations
extending this provision to the procurement of goods and services. However, because
procurement under Panama's laws differ in some very significant respects from the Bank's
standard documents, the Government would be required in the legal opinion for effectiveness
to confirm that the Bank's procedures take precedence over local law.
24.   The Govenmnent does not usualy exempt foreign consultants from local taxes.
Therefore, to reduce possible delays in recruiting and paying consultants, the Government
has agreed to proide all the necessary counterpart funds, including local taxes in the
project's Revolving Fund. The Bank's funds for these services would be released only after
the Government has contributed its share.
25. Approval of contuacts amounting to more than US$250,000 bi the Cabinet and
signing by the President of contracts exceeding US$150,000 is a legal requirement in
Panama. However, over the past year, MOP has successfully reduced the time between bid
opening and contract award to about two months. It was agreed that the length of time for
prior review would be monitored during implementation and that, should the Bank judge the
time too lengthy, the Government would make changes acceptable to the Bank to ensure that
the approval time does not exceed 60 days.
Countmar Pnd
26.  In its policy staement, the Government has indicated a strong commitment to the
Project, evidenced in a commitment to provide appropriate levels of counterpart funds and
road maintenance funds. The Goverment and the Bank have agreed on minimum levIs of
annual funding for counterpart funds and road routine maintenance expenditures during
appraisal, with a view of increasing the latter one to appropriate levels. Government has
agreed to send annually the proposed road budget to the Bank for review, including
apprpriate levels of funding for counterpart funds and routine maintennce expenditures.
An assessment of the Government's performance on the provision of countepart funds is a
key item for the project's mid-term rview.
Disbursements
27.   While this project is a four year time slice of MOP's ongoing road program, the
investments to be carried out during this period have been identified. The mission's best
estimate is that it will take about six years to fully disburse the loan funds associated with
these investments, although MOP plans to complete the bulk of the project in about four
years. With a project completion date of March 31, 2000, the closing date is estimated to be
September 30, 2000. The initial loan proceeds allocations and corresponding percentages to
be disbursed by category are shown in Schedule B.
28.   MOP will be the bonoweres agency in chare of disbursements under the loan.
Expenditures under contract wlued below US$500,000 for civil works, and below



30
US$100,000 for goods and for consulting services would be made on the basis of certified
statements of expenditure (SOE). Disbursement claims above these amounts would be fully
documented. MOP and MGJ would retain the supporting documentation and make it
available for examination by Bank staff during supervision missions. To expedite project
execution and manage the loan proceeds, a Special Account would be established in the
Banco Nacional de Panamn or any other commercial bank acceptable to the Bank with an
initial deposit of US$3.0 million. A Revolving Fund would be established with an initial
amount of US$2.0 million in the Banco Nacional de Panama or any other commercial bank
acceptable to the Bank for the project's counterpart funds. In view of the desirability of
starting the project without delay, retroactive financing up to US$4 million equivalent (6.7
per cent of the loan) is proposed for expenditures incurred after June 30, 1993. Retroactive
financing will be used to finance the initial cost of the first batch of works, as well as some
consultant services required to start up the project. During negotiations, agreement was
reached on these disbursement arrangements.
Aounts and Audits
29. During negotiations, agreement was reached on acceptable Project auditing
procedures. MOP's and MGJ's accounts, including Project accounts, the special account, the
revolving fund, and the statements of expenditures, would be audited by independent auditors
acceptable to the Bank; and audit reports for each financial year would be furnished to the
Bank within six months of the closing date of the audit period. The past audit performance
of MOP has been satisfactory.

Supervision Plan
Staff Input for Project launch and Annual and Mid-Course Reviews
1.   The nature and scope of the project, especially the subsector reforms and the
increase in maintenance by contract, would necessitate extensive and close supervision,
especially during the first two years of project implementation. On the other hand, the
close involvement with the IDB including cooperation with their field office for
supervision should lead to some savings, particularly after the initial intensive phase.
2.    A project launch mission and yearly project reviews will be orgaiized, assisting
the staff of the implementing agencies to develop a common understanding of the
project's overall development objectives, operational procedures, coordination needs and
potential implementation problems and to select the components to be implemented
dunng the subsequent year. A qualified local expert would be engaged, for about two
or tihree days a month, to follow up project implementation for the Bank.

4.    The Project Launch in FY94 would require 7 staff weeks. The Annual Project
Implementation Review would require about 7 staff weeks per year. In addition, one
regular supervision mission (one of one-week duration), comprising the Task Manager
and an Urban Specialist will be necessary. The Mid-Tern Review would require 6 staff
weeks. Thus, total field supervision would amount to 67 staff weeks, and office
supervision is expected to amount to an additional 30 weeks, for a total of 97 staff
weeks during the life of the project, i.e. an average of 16 staffweeks per year.
5.   During the first two years of project implementation, supervision efforts will
focus on organization and team development with a view toward strengthening the PC's
operational capacity. The Project Launch workshop will be followed by additional
supervision input to familiarize selected local staff with the Bank's procurement,
disbursement and auditing procedures and guidelines. It is expected that Batik staff will
assist MOP and the other executing agencies in prioritizing investments as well as staff
resource allocation.
Proposed Agenda for Annual and Mid-Term Inplementation Reviews
6.   The annual project reviev--to be organized by the UECP-wir take place by
September 30 of each year, beginning in 1994, with the participation of the UECP,
representatives of the executing agencies, and IDB and Bank staff. Annual reviews
would focus on evaluation of progress against the implementation of the Transport
Sector Policy and Strategy Statement and Action Plan and against agreed objective-
oriented implementation and impact indicators (Attachment 4), and would serve to
update and revise the 1994-97 toal Road Program (see Attachment 5 for the present
project schedule) and to discuss issues of project management. The result of the annual
review would be the agreement on the following year's program, and on remedial
actions required to address problems or changing circumstances during implementation.
7.   The mid-tenn review to be conducted no later than September 30, 1996 would
follow the same format as the annual reviews but the analysis of project impact would
be expanded. In addition to covering all the areas included in the annual reviews, the
mid-term review would pay particular attention to reviewing compliance with the
Transport Sector Policy and Strategy Statement and Action Plan, including: (a)
Government's freeing the trucling industry from restrictions into the Free Zone; (b)
Government's reviewing the urban passenger transport law and implementing
recommended changes; (c) progress made in sector investment and policy coordination;
(d) Govermment's performance on project counteipart funding and on adequately funding
road maintenance; (e) Govermment's reviewing urban public passenger transport tariffs;
(f) the environmental guidelines for MOP's activities; (g) achievement of stated
perfonnance goals (Attachment 4); (h) effectiveness of technical assistance carried out
under the project; and (i) experience with the environmental assessment of subprojects.
8.   A summary of the areas to be addressed in the annual and mid-term reviews is
presented below.



37
Sector-Wide Issues:
Coordination of Sector Planning and Policies: Progress in the establishment of
a functioning institutional framework for the coordination of sector investments
and policy fornulation;
Road Subsector Issues:
(a)   concentration of road subsector investments on rehabilitation and priority
completion of projects;
(b)   availability and timeliness of project counterpart funds and road
maintenance funds;
(c)   progress in continuing reductioii of MOP staff (Attachment 4);
(d)   effectiveness of technical assistance;
(e)   effectiveness and experience with the environmental assessment of sub-
