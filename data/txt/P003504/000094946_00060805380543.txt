1. PROJECT BACKGROUND
A) Brief Description of the Project and Its Main Purpose
Xinxiang to Zhengzhou Grade I Highway is an important part of 107 National Highway, also is
one part of Beijing to Zhuhai National Expressway in construction. It is a very important
channel for traffic of north and south. The highway connected Zhengzhou, capital of Henan
Province, and Xinxiang, an important industrial city of Henan together. Other parts of Beijing to
Zhuhai expressway in Henan Province, Anyang to Xinxiang, Zhengzhou to Luohe had been
finished as expressway. But now the Xinxiang to Zhengzhou highway can not satisfy the needs
of developed economics due to the increasing traffics. The observed traffic of the sections north
of Zhengzhou Yellow River Bridge has increased from 8300 per day (at 1992) to 12000 per day,
sections south of the bridge increased from 10400 per day (at 1992) to 18000 per day (change to
Middle Size Truck). It is much more than the design capacity. Due to the shorts of fund, to
upgrading the highway to expressway to accomplish the Beijing to Zhuhai National Expressway
is very necessary. To upgrading the highway can get rid of disturb of crosswise traffic, raise
passing abilities and reduce accident.
B) Areas Affected and Served by the Project
The upgrading project of Xinxiang to Zhengzhou Grade I Highway affected Xinxiang and
Yuanyang counties. After upgrading, a 45.38km auxiliary lane (include discontinuous auxiliary
lane); 24 overpasses; 3 interchanges and 9 underpasses will be constructed. The project satisfied
living and production needs of local residence, so they praise the project to be "for the
convenience of the people".
Xinxiang and Yuanyang located on Huabei Plain of north China; both of them are main place of
grain, fruit and other economical crop production of Henan province. Especially Yuanyang
County is the Base of Rice Production of China. This project will greatly promote the
development of local economic and benefit Beijing to Zhuhai National Expressway.
C) Social and Economic Background of the Project Area
Yuanyang County located 30km southeast from Xinxiang City and 50km north from Zhengzhou.
It has 800,000 mu of cultivated lands. The population of Yuanyang County is 500,000 by 1996.
Xinxiang County located nearby Xinxiang City, 72km north from Zhengzhou. It has 460,000 mu
of cultivated lands. The population of Xinxiang County is 380,000 by 1996. Main crops of the
two counties are wheat, rice, cotton, peanut and so on. Main industries are motor parts,
medicine, petroleum and chemical industry. The county and township enterprises are economical
pillars of the two counties. In 1996, total industrial value of Yuanyang County is 620 millions,
and 6,000 millions of Xinxiang County. But highway systems of the two counties can not fit the
develop speed of economic, and had limited the speedy increasing of economics.
The Xinxiang to Zhengzhou Grade I Highway, completed in 1989, is for mixing traffics.
Hundreds of plane crosses caused so many accidents. Those accidents damaged not only
properties but also lives of local residence. Recent years, heavy traffic increased so much, the
concrete pavement was destroyed seriously, and about 40% of concrete plate were broken. So
the existing pavement can not server the economic and traffics properly, it should be upgraded.
D) Measures Taken to Minimize Resettlement
The Upgrading Project had taken lots of measures to minimize resettlement. During Feasibility
Study period, the project had made two schemes. Scheme Owhich was put to use is to make use
of existing county-township lanes as possible. This also fits the City Construction Development



Program of the two counties. Although it acquired 142 mu more lands than scheme 0, but it
minimized resettlement of 1206 houses, 63 places of affected power lines, 17 places of
communications and reduced pollution of noise and exhaust of traffic to the local residents.
During implementation, temporary lands acquired will be resumed to cultivated lands. If
possible borrow pits will be selected on wastelands. If on cultivated lands, depth of excavation
will be limited for resume. Temporary land acquisition did not affect any local residents,
households, structures and infrastructures, so no any resettlement should be done.
During temporary land acquisition except pay land compensations, the PRO also try to give
some temporary jobs to laborers whose land was acquired to increase incomes of people.
E) Technical and Economic Feasibility Study
The project is in the administration of Henan Province, need not to be approved by MOC and
SPC. Feasibility Study Report document N2 YJJ(1998) 126 of Henan Provincial Communication
Department had been approved by document NQ YJJ(1998) 356 of Plan Committee of Henan
Province.
F) Preliminary and Final Design of the Project
The design of the project was finished by  at Mar 5,1998, and reported by document No
YJJ(1998) 318 of Henan Provincial Communication Department, approved by document No
YJJ( 1998) 1101 of Plan Committee of Henan Province.
G) Ownership and Organization of the Project
Ownership of the project is the state. The Highway Management Bureaus of Henan Provincial
Communication Department responsible for management and maintain of the project.
During Implementation, offices of PRO on different level responsible for the land acquisition
and resettlement.
H) The Census (Social Survey)
The invest team formed by IMO, CIRO, CORO and TRO staff and PAPs representatives will
execute the Social Survey of the project from Apr 20 to May 25, 1998. Contents of the survey
are visit officers of township, village and PAPs, collect data. Data include economical situations,
natural souses, geographical features, market price of materials of affected areas and basically
production methods, living level, custom of living, distributions of households, attached
structures and ideals to project of PAPs. Methods used are to collect official statistical data of
last three years from local Statistics Bureau and visit local residents.
At Oct 1997 CIRO, CORO, TRO and PAPs conscientious measured acquired lands and checked
attached structures together, signed on the register table to confirn. From the Social Survey
knows most of local residents take welcome and support manner to the project. While checking
attached structures, there have some subject to dispute. Survey staff considered ideas of PAPs
according facts, on principal of "PAPs should not suffering lose" solved the problems.
During implementation and I year after project complete, MPO and IMO will start following
monitoring and report social economical situations of affected areas to PRO, to improve their
works.
I) Preparation of the Resettlement Action Plan
(1) Total quantities of land acquisition and attached structures, affected population affected by
the project will be provided by design institute according final design. Also design institute
will provide economic statistic data of affected areas, forecast of prospects on traffic and
development of economic after project accomplished.
(2) Establish organization for resettlement works. Resettlement organization on different levels
of the project established in Feb 1998. COROs and Construction Leading Group of Xinxiang
County and Yuanyang County responsible for conduction of permission for land acquisition,
resettlement of PAPs and other issues authorized by PRO, CIRO.
(3) PRO will publicize importance of the project and polities, regulations of the state or province
executed in the project.
(4) COROs draw up the RAP, especially the staff training plan and land readjust plan.

K) Permission for Land Use, Resettlement and Construction
Total land acquisition for the project is 1877.64 mu; temporary land acquisition is 335 mu. At
Sep 1998, PRO reported land acquisition plan and all the approved documents by province of
the project to the state. On Nov 30,1998 got permission of land acquisition. PAPs lost lands will
be resettled by land readjust and land readjust will be done before project commence.
L) Decree on Rates of Compensation
Regulations for land acquisition of the project are Land Law of Henan Province and
Implementation Regulations of Land Law.
Clause 30: Land acquisition for state construction, units acquired lands should pay
implementation for land acquisition. Implementation rates are: the compensation fee for
cultivated land (including suburban vegetable plots, orchards and ponds) should be 5 times of
average annual production value per mu. Calculation of average annual production value per mu
according statistical data of affected county provided by Statistical Bureau of County.
Compensation fee for standing crops should be 0.3 times of average annual production value per
mu. Compensation fee for attached structures according to regulations of local government.

Secondary Effects Due to Land Readjustment
To provide land for the PAPs affected by land acquisition, 454035 mu lands in 41villages (work
teams) will undergo land readjustment. As a result, 56683 agricultural labor households will be
affected due to land readjustment (secondary effects). The total number of PAPs in these
households is 283417.
Brief Description: This project has no city land acquisition. 80% of income of PAPs comes
from agriculture. Every laborer has 3 mu responsibility land and 1.65 mu land for personal
needs. Land will be readjusted in village.

30LEGAL FRAMEWORK
A) Policy
Policies on land acquisition and resettlement are formulated at three levels of government in
China:
*   The central government has established the basic policy framework through promulgation of
national regulations and implementation guidelines.
*   Provincial governments have issued either general or project-specific regulations on
implementation of national regulations.
*   Prefectures, municipalities and counties have issued regulations applying to specific projects.
This RAP is prepared in accordance with the laws and regulations listed below and the Word
Bank Guidelines on Involuntary Resettlement (0D4.03). The implementation of the RAP will be
carried out in accordance with this legal framework.
El National Laws and Regulations
The following laws comprise the key national policies on land Olgrassland and forests:
LiThe State Land Law(passed by the 18th session of the 6th National Congress in June 1986 and
revised by the 5th session of the 7th National Congress in December 1988),Implementation
Regulations of Land law.
0 State For Grassland Law (passed by the 11th session of the 6th National Congress in June
1985).
[ State Forestry Law and Implementation Regulations of Forest Law.
Ownership
C1 The ownership of all land is vested in either the state or the collectives.
El Collective land is managed and operated by village councils.
C County govemments register collective lands and issue certificate of ownership to villages.
For state construction, only government above the county level are permitted to issue
certificates authorizing rights to the use of land to state units (institutions and enterprises),
collectives and individuals.
[ Any change in ownership or the right to use the land must be officially recorded and a new
certificate issued.
C Once acquired for a state project, collective land becomes stated land.
Land Use
l The law permits transfer of right of both state and collective-owned lands.
[ Contracting of both state and collective lands to collective units and individuals is permitted
and contracts meeting the procedural requirement are protected by law.
C1 The state will establish a national land survey system and a land statistical system.
0 Each level of government, from the township and above, are required to prepared a land plan;
the national plan is to be drafted by State Land Bureau.
C Conversion of cultivated land exceeding 3 mu into non-agricultural use must be authorized by
government above county level.
D Contracted lands or self-consumption lands must be used for the specified purpose and cannot
be converted to other use, such as housing, grave yard, mining, borrow pit etc...
C When arable land is used for mining, or excavating(for sand and earth), the user is responsible
for restoring the land.
Land For State Construction
1 Approval procedures
*   Project units must apply to land administration departments of county governments for
land with a feasibility study, annual construction schedules and other specified
documents.
*   After reviewing the application and examining the lands to be acquired, the land
administration department coordinates discussions on land compensation and
resettlement plans among the project office, owners or users of the land, and relevant
government department. After concluding these discussions, the land administration



department of the county government submits its recommendation for approval to
higher levels of government.
* Upon approval, the relevant government department issues a document authorizing
allocation of the required land.
2 Authority For Approval
*   For state construction projects, the State Council must approval acquisition of cultivated
land exceeding 1,000 mu and others type of land exceeding 2,000 mu.
*  Provincial governments have the authority to approve any amount of land acquisition
within their provinces.
*   County governments can approve acquisition of cultivated land below 3 mu and other
types of land below 10 mu.
*   Provincial congresses determine the limits of the authority of prefecture and municipal
governments for land acquisition.
0 The project must compensate the affected units or persons for loss of land, standing crops,
and resettlement.
0 In case of acquisition of suburban vegetable plots, State regulation require the project unit to
pay for the development of new vegetable plots.
0 Formulas to calculate the amounts of compensation are specified:
*   The compensation fee for cultivated land should be 3 - 6 times the average annual
production value per mu during three years prior to acquisition.
*   On the basis of formulas, the provincial and municipal governments should establish the
rate of compensation rate for other type of land.
v   With reference to the formulas for cultivated land, provincial and municipal government
should determine the rate of compensation rate for standing crops and attached
structures.
-   Based on the number of agriculture population to be resettled, the regulations stipulate
payment of a resettlement grant. The amount of the resettlement grant is to be
determined on a per capita basis and should be 2 - 3 times the average output value per
mu during three years prior to land acquisition. The amount of the grant, however,
should not exceed 10 times the annual value of the produce. The formula for calculating
the number of the agriculture population to be resettled is to be divided the area of the
acquired cultivated land by the average per capita land holdings of the unit prior to the
land acquisition. Provincial and municipal governments are to calculate the amount of
resettlement grant for other types of land with reference to the grant for the cultivated
land.
*   Should the resettlement grant prove inadequate to maintain the previous living standards
of the people, provincial and municipal government can increase the amount of
resettlement grant. But the combined amount of compensation for land and resettlement
grant should not exceed 20 times the average annual production value per mu during the
previous three years.
*   Temporary occupation of land must be compensated on the basis of the average annual
production value during the 3 years prior to land acquisition.
0 The affected collective units must use the land compensation and resettlement grant to
develop production and create jobs for the surplus labor or provide living subsidies for people who
unable to work. The funds can not be diverted to other use or be kept by any other units or
individuals.
0 Compensation for standing crops and attached private structures should be paid to the
individuals.
[ The county land administration department, the project owner and the affected units must
engage in a coordinated effort to provide jobs to surplus laborers through development of
agricultural production, sideline production and township or village enterprises. Should their
efforts prove insufficient, employment for qualified laborers can be arranged in collective or state
units, to whom the relevant resettlement grant must be paid.
0 If all the lands of a unit is acquired, the goverrunent can approve a change in the status of its
population from agricultural into non-agricultural registration. In such case, city, county and
township government and villages should decide whether to use the land compensation money,



the resettlement grant, and the collective property of the unit for productive purpose or to pay
living subsidies to those unable to work. However, the funds cannot be distributed among
individuals.
Land For Township and Village Construction
0 Rural construction on farming land must be strictly controlled.
0 Use of cultivated land for residence must be approved by village councils, township
governments, county land administration departments and county governments.
O Use of other types of land for residence must be approved by village committees or village
councils and township governments.
0 Use of land for township and village industries must be approved by county land
administration departments and appropriate local governments.
[1 Use of collective land for private non-agricultural operations must approved by village
committees, township governments and county governments.

C) Job Creation
E Land Redistribution by Village
Principles of Measurement
Land in the villages and work teams is distributed to the eligible agricultural laborers on an equal
basis. Each able bodied member of the village between 25 and 55 are eligible laborers to receive
land distribution (as El responsibility land; and, 0 for cultivation for self consumption). Average
land holdings of eligible laborers are summarized in Table 5.9. on a township basis. When land is
acquired for the project, land belongs to villages and work teams will be readjusted if the average
land endowment of the village (work team) is above the average endowment of the township. If
the per laborer land endowment of the village (work team) falls below the township level, then
affected laborers and persons will be resettled in non agricultural employment. In planning for this
outcome the following calculations are made:
PAPRV = LAV - LPC
PALV = LAV LPAL
PAPRV = planned number of RAPs to be resettled in a village
LAV = total land acquired in the village for the project
LPC = per capital land holdings in township
PALV = planned number of Agricultural Laborers to be resettled in a village
LPAL = per Agricultural Laborer land holdings in township
Table 5.9. is based on the above calculation. It presents the number of RAPs and Agricultural
Laborers to be resettled if only complete land holdings were to be acquired .

7[1PARTICIPATION AND CONSULTATION
The resettlement and rehabilitation program of the project was prepared through the active
participation of the RAPs. Preliminary information on the project was disseminated to the RAPs
during the census, and a public option survey was conducted on the RAPs and also the
communities, which will be influenced by the project. Results of that survey is presented in Table
7.1. and 7.2.
Information dissemination meeting were held at the village level where suggested compensation
rates on housing, crop loss, location of resettlement sites and enterprise employment alternatives
were presented to the RAPs. As a consequence of such meetings revisions were made in the RAP
to accommodate the response of the RAP. A summary of the PAPs input into RAP is summarized
in Table 7.1.
Meetings will continue to be held to inform the PAPs about the progress of the project and to
obtain further input. City and county governments also participated actively in shaping the
resettlement policy.
PAPs are already informed about the project impact on their assets, possible resettlement sites and
change of employment from agriculture to enterprise. They have also stated their preference
among possible alternatives during preliminary meetings. A Resettlement Information Booklet (
RIB ) was prepared as described in section 5-i . After the review of the RAP by the Bank the RIB
will be reproduced and distributed to all the PAP households, indicating their exact entitlements.
Consultations were held with the members of affected communities to evaluate the technical
aspects of the project. Locations of underpasses, their height and width were evaluated in terms of
current and further needs of the communities.
The following are the avenues of participation of the PAPs in the resettlement process. PAPs have
participated in some of these activities and will continue to participate for the duration of
resettlement implementation.
*   Selection of specific resettlement locations for residential housing and enterprise.
* Construction of their ( PAPs ) own houses. ( Or selecting from among government built
houses).
*   Determining themselves ( PAPs ) whether the compensation received is the replacement
value and voices their grievance through the mechanism development for the project.
*   That eligible for jobs will be able to select particular enterprise where they wish to be
employed.
* Discuss their concerns about resettlement with the independent monitors during the frequent
monitoring surveys.
*   Local Township and district resettlement offices with the support of village councils and the
PAPs will manage implementation of resettlement. Easy and direct access to implementing
authorities will be available.

80GRIEVANCE AND APPEALS
Since the entire Resettlement and Rehabilitation program is being carried out with the
participation of the PAPs, it is expected that no major grievance issue will arise. However, to
ensure that the PAPs have avenues for redressing their grievances related to any respect of land
acquisition and resettlement, detailed procedures of redress of grievances have been established
for the project. The objective is to respond to the complaints of the PAPs speedily and in a
transparent maimer. The mechanism is designed to be easy, accessible, transparent and fair. The
purpose is to respond to grievance issues in an effective manner without resorting to complicated
formal channels to the extent possible. By resolving grievance at the project level, the progress of
the project would be more effectively ascertained.
The procedures are as follows:
Stage 1:
If any aspect of the resettlement and rehabilitation program aggrieves any person, he/she can lodge
an oral or written grievance with the Village Administration Committee or the local TRO.
In case an oral compliant is made, it will be written on paper by the village unit and processed.
Village Administration Committee or the TRO will resolve the issue within 2 weeks.
Stage 2:
If the Aggrieved person is not satisfied with the decision in stage I , he/she can bring the
complaint to the attention of the CORO within I month from the date of the receipt of the decision
in stage I . CORO will reach a decision on the complaint within 2 weeks.
Stage 3:
If the Aggrieved person is not satisfied with the decision of the CORO, he/she can bring the
complaint to the attention of the PRO within I month from the date of the receipt of the decision
in stage 2 . PRO will reach a decision on the complaint within 3 weeks.
Stage 4:
If the PAP is still dissatisfied by the decision, he/she can appeal to the Peoples Court in accordance
with the "Civil Procedure Act" within 15 days of receiving the decision of the PRO.
PAPs can make an appeal on any aspect of the resettlement and rehabilitation program, including
compensation rates being offered.
Detailed procedures for redress of grievances and the appeal process is publicized among the PAPs
during participation meetings and also posted in the offices of Village Administration Committees,
TROs, COROs and CIROs.
This information is also incorporated into the RIB to be distributed to the PAPs before the
beginning of implementation.
9 31MONITORING
[1 During the implementation, CIROs and COROs will enter implementation information from the
TROs on and individual, household and unit basis on templates prepared for monitoring and
deliver the record of the current activity in electronic from to the PRO. In this way a continuous
monitoring of implementation will be maintained. PRO will conduct periodic supervision of
resettlement at the village and township level to verify the reported progress on a random basis.
In the overall framework there will be continuous floe of information on a regular format from the
village level to the PRO and periodic supervision and verification by the PRO. All levels of the
resettlement organization will therefore participate in the integrated monitoring mechanism.

a) Standards of Living Surveys (SLS)
Methodology: The IMO will conduct a baseline SLS on a random sample of PAPs and a control
group before the beginning of the resettlement implementation. SLS will be repeated twice to
measure the change in the standards of living of the PAPs. This activity will be one of several
approaches to determine the changes in the living standards of the PAPs. Open ended interviews
with the PAPs and observational methods will also be utilized to supplement and guide the
structured interview format.
Development and testing of the Questionnaire: The questionnaires for the SLS will be
developed considering the material and cultural factors of the locality to capture the quantitative
and qualitative measures of standards of living. After the questionnaire is prepared it will be tested
in practice surveys to determine its effectiveness as a measurement tool and will be revised based
on the results.
Training of the enumerators: The enumerators will be trained in the application of the
questionnaire in training exercises using the revised questionnaire.
Procedures for editing, coding the surveys: Enumerators will be supervised by a sufficient
number of team leaders who will edit all the complete questionnaires in the presence of the
enumerators on the same day the questionnaires are completed.
Other organizations responsible in the conduct of the SLS: PRO will extend assistance to the
IMO during the conduct of the SLS by providing logistical support whenever necessary. Local
ROs will also assist and facilitate the work of the IMO.
Sample size of different groups of PAPs and the Control Group: The size of the random
sample that will be taken from the census data will be as follows
* PAPs (general) 10%
*   Affected through job loss 25%
v   Other PAPs identified as at risk 25%
e   Secondary PAPs 3%
b) Public Consultation
IMO will participate in public consultation meetings held at the village and township level on a
regular basis. Immediately after its appointment, IMO will send 2 of its staff to attend at least 2
public consultation meetings per month. Through participation in these incorporation of the PAPs
concerns into the RAP. If IMO identifies problems with the openness and effectiveness of these
meetings, it will suggest improvements in the structure and procedure of these meetings.
These activities will continue before during and after the implementation of resettlement.
c) Grievance Issues
IMO will regularly visit sites and inquire about the grievance issues by interviewing the ROs
receiving the grievances and also by interviewing the PAPs. Effectiveness of the grievance
resolution framework will be constantly monitored and if necessary suggestions will be made for
possible changes in the procedures to make the process more effective.
