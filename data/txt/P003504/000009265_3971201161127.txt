1. Project  Background
Beijing - Shenzhen Highway is an important north to south passageway Of
higlhway transportation, it is also one of the National Truik Highway
System planned by Ministry of Communications. Shijiazhuang-Anyanu
Expressway (SAE) transverses the mid-south part of Hebei Province wh 1icl
is 216.05 km with a total investment 3686 million yuan. The
intercoinecting roads to SAE are the auxiliary works which fonn the w hole
project. In order to bing the economic radication functions of SAE into full
play and to incorporate the interconlecting roads with provincial l-ighwav
net works, these roads are proposed on the basis of consultations witlh the
local governments by Hebei Provincial Communications Department
(HPOD).
Entrusted by HPCD in Julv 1991, Highway Scientific Rsesarech Institute
of Ministry of Communications was asked to carry out environ ment
asessment work for SAE and to prepare EIA for the project. In May 1992
the Environmenit Protection Office of MOC carried out appraisal for the
project environment Terms of Reference (TOR) On June 9,1992 National
Enivironument Protection Agency (NEPA) held appraisal meeting in
Shijiazhiuang for the project enviromnent TOR. On June 25, 1992
commenits for the TOR were given by issuance of the Document No.084
(1992).
Based on the approved TOR, the entrusted agency has carried out environment
work and prepared ETA for the project. This work had lasted for 19 months.
In March 1993, the EIA was reviewed and approved by Enviromnent
protection Office of MOC and NEPA. Besides the EIA and the Summarv
of Environment Assessment, Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) and
Enviroinmenit Action Plan (EAP) had also been prepared. In addition,
trainin1g courses in regard of environment protection had been included in
the training program, and complete survey report for the cultural relocs had
been attached.
Highway Scientific Research Institute of MOC which undertakes the
environment impact asessment of the interconnecting roads, with the help
of Hebei Provincial Communications Planning and Design Istitute and local
governments at each level, camred out surveys and in vestigations for the
interconnecting roads. Relevant environment data have been collected, and
many feasibility study meetings have been attended. Based oni thses data
anid materials, the present ETA of the interconnecting roads has been
prepared. The interconnecting roads are the counterpart works of Slii-Ain
Expressway.The principles and mitigation measures in the ETA and EAP

2: Introduction
Shijiazhuang-Anvang Expressway Interconmecting Road Improvemei
Program  is based on the great economic changes in Hebei Province
incorporation with the provincial higlhway network planning . The adjustment
of the Interconniecting Roads Improvement Program will facilitate the full play
of overall benefits of Shi-Ani Expressway.
The proposed improvement programs (six interconnecting roads) are as
follows:
1. Handan (one road):
Cixian Interchange-Linzhang Interconnecting Road;
2. Xingtai (four roads):
a. Shahe Interchange-Nanhe Interconnecting Road;
b. South Xingtai Interchange Electric Power Plant Crossing-Nandou
Village Intercomnecting Road;
c. Neiqiu Interchange Neiqiu-Beizhang ma Interconnecting Road;
d. Gaoyi Interchange Gaoyi Baixiang-Ningjin Intercomnecting Road:
3. Shijiazhuang:
Shijiazhuang Nortl Interchange Interconnecting Road and
The total length of the above mentioned six interconnecting roads is 80.299
km, of wliich Shijiazhuang North Interchange Interconnecting Road and Southl
Xingtai Interchange Electric Power Plant Crossing-Nandou Village
Interconnecting Road will be constructed into class I road , the others will be
class II roads.

location map of interconnecting roads.
3. Description of Environment Impact
3.1 Environment Description: In light of the state environment protection
reguiations and standards and through the analysis and evaluationis of the
six linking roads environment impacts within the evaluation scopes,
corresponding protection measures and recommendations have been
posed and evaluation conclusions have been reached which provided
scientific basis for rational alignment selection and optimization designs as
well as environment development planning.
Since each interconnecting road is not long (the total lengths of the six
roads ammount to 80.299km) ,and these roads will be constructed in pace
with the expressway,the impacts as will as to saftly and environmelnt dLring
construction periods have not been separablely taken into



considerations .And neither construction camps will be set Up separareix.
The impact of construction camps and construction traffic as well as theirl
corresponding measures will follow those relevant ones proposed in EA
and EAP for the expressway.
3.2 Evaluation Scope: 200m at the both sides of the center line of the proposed
interconnecting roads , and the investigation analysis scopes of social
environment and ecological environment can.be appropriately enlargied.
3.3 Evaluation Standard: Noise evaluation will be made in accordance with
GB3096-83  (( Urban Area Environment Noise Standard )) , of wlhich
((Trunk Highway Both Sides )) standards for both sides of the road and
(( Mixed Class II )) standard for schools and hospitals shall be execLuted
and class II standard of GB3095-82  (( Atmospheric Envirolnmienital
Quantity Standard )) shall be used.
3.4 Evaluation Methodology: It is the same as that of the main line . A
combination of points with the alignment , fanning out from point to
alignment are used for evaluation . Model computation and analogue
analysis are used for the evaluation of noise and atmosphere while tihe
metlhod of investigation and analysis are adopted for evaluation of ecology.

1. Outline
1. I Construction Back-ground
The existing road from Cixiali to Linzlhang is class III road wViTil
subgrade width 8m and residual asphalt pavement width 6m . In 1995 the
traffic volume reached 1471 v/d . At present the road is deteriorated withi
troughs and cracks which account for 75%  of the total pavement .
Therefore , it is urgenit to upgrade the road . This interconnecting road
constitutes the major transport route for the counties in the east of the
Handan district as well as some districts in Henan and Shandong provinces,
and it is also one of the trunk highways in the "five longitudinal and four
horizontal highways " plaluned by Handain City . The completion of the
higlhway will be very important for outbound transportationi of Coali
building materials as well as economic development along the route . st
the same time , it will be very convenient for exit and entrance to lite
expressway which will bring the expressway into full play.
i.2  Route Alignment.and Main Control Points
The route starts at Cixian Interchange (intercrossed road K+-550).
leading eastward along the existing road by passing Huangxinzhuan .
Nandongfang ,Fangbiao,and ends at Linzhlang Bus Station with a total
length 15.441km.

The total cost estimates of the project are 26.507 million RMB3 (The
World Bank Loan 10.34 million RMB , province raising funds 16. 1 o871
million RiviB ) , which is 1.7166 million RMB for per km . It is planned to
start the work in 1997 and complete in 1998 at the same time with Slhi-An
Expressway . The construction period is one year.
1.5 Analysis of major environment impact factors
Generally, highway constructions will inevitably cause adverse impacts
to natLral environment and social environment along the route duniniz
design  , construction  and  operation  periods  .   Considering  the
characteristics of the interconnecting roads and the status quo of the
environment , the major impacts to the environment along the route caused
by the works are:
Design Period: Demolition , Resettlement , the status quo of the land resources
have been changed;
Construction Penrod:  The natural environment along the route has been
changed by the works , farm lands and orchards have been acquired xvith
the impacts of construction noise and dust pollution;
Operational Period: Vehicle exhaust gases and traffic noise compose of one of
the important factors of pollution to environment sensitive targets along the
route .
2. Environment Status Quo and Evaluation
2.1 Natural environment
Linzhang county is located at mountainous alluvial fanning plain
9



which is caused by ancient Yellow River with the Land fonn gradually
descending from west to east . The altitude is from 58 to 95 m . This area
enjoys a temperate conitinental monsoon climate . The average annual
temperature is 13.2°C . Temperatures can range from -21.80C in the winter
to as much as 41.9°C in the summer . The average annual precipitation is
565.7 mm which is concentrated in July and August . The earth types along
the route consist of humid loam , river brown earth and humid clav .
2.2 Social Environment Status Quo and Evaluation
Located in the far most south part of Hebei Province , Linzhang county
borders oni Henan Province in the south which is under the jurisdiction of
Handan City . The total area is 749.9 km2 , of which cultivated lands
amount to 750,000 mu . There are 14 towns and 425 villages witlh a total
population 541676 . Being the state level grain and cotton production base,
Linzhang county was listed into state grain production county in 1994
-which was approved by the State Council and in 1995 it was listed as
cotton production county by the State Council . The industries in the
county as coal , electric power, garment processing , building materials,
machinery, chemical industry etc. have been initially set up .
In 1995 GNP of Linzhang county reached 721 million RMB (as the
year 1990 constant price ) which is 91% of the year 1990 with an average
annual growth rate 13.8% . It is planned by the year 2000 GNP will reach
1.56 billion RUB with an average annual growth rate of 16.7% . On the
basis of overall realization of the " Ninth Five Year Plan ", by the year
2010 GNP will reach 5.78 billion RMB which maintains a growth rate of
14%.
2.3 Acoustic Environment Status Quo and Evaluation
Cixian interchange-Linzhang interconnecting road traverses
Huangxinzhuang , Nandong fang and Fangbiao villages in Linzhang county
with a total length 15.2 km . On the basis of highway characteristics and
environment terrain and climate , three monitoring points have been set up,
namely  at Huang Xinzhuang  ,Nandongfang   and Fangbiao  for
environment noise background monitoring . The monitoring results are as

The above monitorimn data show that acoustic environmenit alon- tihe
route is good without disturbing industrial noise sources . 'here is a cerrain
acoustic capacity along the route.
2.4  Atmospheric enviromnent Status Quo and Evaluation
The proposed interconniecting road is far from the down town of cities aild
towns . Along the route there are mainly resident villages and large areas of
farm lands . Since that there are no industries and mines , industrial pollutioni
sources do not exist . Withiin the range of 200 m at the both sides of the route
three atmospheric environmenit monitoring points have been set up (the same as
the acoustic environlment sensitive poilnts ). The monitoring results are:
Name             CO average value      NO, average value
in five days                          l
IHuanrgxinzhuang      1.20 mg /m3           0.025 mg /m'

Fangbiao               1.30 mg /m3          0.034 mg
The above results for CO and NO, show the concentration values are in
accordance with grade II atmospheric enviromnent quality standard which have
rather great atmospheric environment capacity .
3.  Environment Impact Prediction and Evaluation
3.1 Natural envirolunent impact analysis
The proposed main line has taken into account of main river flood
discharging capacity . Though some sections have no obvious river beds,
large and medium bridges have been set up . The locations of meditun anid
small bridges , and culverts are corresponding to those of railway so as
guarantee the smooth flow  of flood in rainy season . Therefore
interconnecting road has little impact to flood control of this area .
The agnrculture along the rout is rather developed which is important
grain and cotton production base . Pumping underground water is of the
main method for farm  land irrigation    The construction of the
interconnecting road will acquire some motor-pumped wells and will cut off
some irrigation chamnels . Therefore , in cases of acquisition and cut-off of
wells compensation measures shall be taklen to ensure that there will be
wells at the both sides of the road in order to solve the problem of
irrigations . Irrigation culverts shall not be generally constructed on the road
11



subgrade , however, at some sections irrigation has been done by main or
sub irrigation channel leading to the rivers . Therefore , at these sections
culverts shall be constructed on the basis of the existing chanlel layouts to
secure . water passing or pedestrian passing . If the above measures cani be
executed , the existing irrigation layout can be maintained which will take
care of farming to the greatest extent.
3.2 Social Environment Impact Evaluation
After the completion of the interconnecting road , a series of production
strips will be formed , especially great influence will be brought to social
economic development , production structures as well as composite
proportion of social workers of the direct influenced areas along the route.
(1) As the implementation of overall planning of cities and towns and after
the completion of the project the transport conditions will be greatly
improved . The industrial layouts will gradually be moved towards the
outskirts and will be spread out along the interconnecting road;
^(2) The completion of the project will promote the construction of
development zones along the route which will push the integrated utilization
of lands and resources so as to lead to rational industrial layouts .
(3) The road will indirectly cause the demanding needs for telepost
communications, electric power supplies which result in the development of
these industries . And at the same time will promote the development of
culture, education , medical cares etc.
(4) Land acquisition and reallocation
The Total lands acquired for interconnectioning roads amotunt to
394.78 mu,of which cultivated lands 234.58 mu, demolished houses 6712m2
which are all village houses. In order to minimize affected people the
alignment makes full use of existing roads so as to avoid large areas of
demolition offices have been set up at each level in the highway construction
sectors and detailed resettlement plans have been made for this project.
Due to the great social and economic benefits brought by the
completion of the project, the special land values of highway acquisition
shall be realized,. Since that new industrial production enterprises will be
formed in the highway corridor after the completion of the project , the
adjacent lands prices will be doubled, and the lands will be turned from
cultivated farms to non-cultivated lands. In order to avoid the rapid loss of
12



cultivated lands resources  it is recommended that the land mana-emenT
departmenits must enhance the approval of various construction land uses.
3.3 Acoustic Enviromnent Impact Predication and Analysis
3.3.1 Acoustic enviroinmelnt impact during construction
During construction period the noise is mainly comin'ug from
construction machinery's and transport vehicles . According to local
surveys , the road construction machineries are : bulldozer , excavator.
roller etc . The following table shows the noise testing level of some of the
construction maclineries at different distances:

Distances

The construction noise pollution will directly affect the health and
normal rests of workers and inhabitants at the sensitive targets and even will
disturb their work . However, the noise is short term pollution . In order to
mitigate the construction noise , effective. management and protection
measures can be taken .
From the analogue monitoring data it can be seen that acoustic
environment beyond I O rn will have small influence .
3.3.2   Acoustic environment influence prediction and analysis during,
operation periods
(1) Prediction computation model
The traffic equivalent noise levels depend on the vehicle radiation noise
level, driving speed, traffic volumes , vehicle type composite proportions,
13



pavement evenness and meteorological conditions   On the basis of
international and domestic studies on traffic noise predictions and
incorporation of the project characteristics , the pxediction of the
computation model is:
Ni       7   1-a
Le.v=LATmIjOLg&y) + 1 OLg(-)   +A'S-1
e?  Armax   T[ 'i     2t
The total traffic equivalent noise level at analysis point P is:
Leqii#E =       0
,=1
Where as:
Leqi--- equivalent acoustic value (dB) of i-class vehicle
LAimax --- reference average maximum A acoustic level (dB) of i-class
vehicle
N, ---traffic flow volume (vehicle /h ) of i-class vehicle
V, --- average speed (km/h) of i-class vehicle
T-- average time (at least 1 hour taken)
r ---distance (m) from reference observing point Laiimax Po to traveling
line
r -- distance (m) from evaluation point P to traveling line
a-- attenuation factor , relevant to the absorption characteristics of ground
covers.
A s --- noise reduction by barrier
(2) The selection of relevant parameters in the model
The selection of each computed parameters in the model is based on the
characteristics of the specific works of the interconnecting road.
(3) Traffic noise impact prediction during operational stage
On the basis of traffic noise prediction model and the relevant computed
parameters , the traffic noise prediction values for the proposed interconnecting
road at each evaluation year are shown in table 2-4.

3.4 Atmospheric Environment Impact Prediction and Evaluation
3.4.1 Environment impact analysis during construction period
Dusts constitute the major atmospheric pollution during construction
period , therefore , the evaluation factor is determined as TSP . During
construction whether lime soil mixing is on the site or at the plant , TSP
pollution will be inevitably caused to environment along the route . hi 1990
TSP monitoring was carried out for both on the site mixing and plant
mixing of on going Beijing-Tianjin-Tanggu Expressway . The results are
shown in table 2-7.

From  the above monitored analogue material it shows that the
characteristics of on the site mixing is that the pollution will be broughit to
wherever the construction starts , but the influenced scope of areas are
narrow and temporary , and TSP contents in atmosphere at 50 m from the
roadsides can meet class II standard (The limited TSP average daily
concentration is 0.30 mg/m3, any time 1.00 mg/m3). If plant mixing is
adopted , the TSP concentration at from the mixing plant on the leeward is
8.90 mg/m3 which 8 times surpass the standard , but there are no
influences at 150 m from the mixing plant.
As for the somke form bitumine emulsion, it is tested that Class I
standard can be met at 100 m away on the leeward (the average density of
emission allowed in 8 hour is less than 150 mg/Nm3).
3.4.2 Environment impact prediction during operation period
After the interconnecting road has been completed the major impacts to
environment during operation period are emitted pollutants in the exhausted
16



vehicle gases . The prediction factors are CO, NO,, prediction year limits
are 2000 , 2010 and 2017 . And the pollution at the both sides of the road is
concentrated in day time with big traffic volumes . The rate of occurrin- E
and F type stability in daytime is small . Therefore, the prediction is only
carred out on the computations of D tvpe (medium).

(3) Computation results analysis
From the computation results in table 2-8, 2-9, 2-10, they show that
CO and NO, pollutants emitted by vehicles during operation period of
Cixian interchange-Linzhang interconnecting road have little impacts to
surrounding environment along the route. The main reason is that the
predicted traffic volumes of this section are small .'As the development of
economic constructions speed up and- the measures taken to reduce
pollutions of vehicle movable resources, the atmospheric enviromnent
quality of the road or the area in future will be greatly improved.

4. Enviromnent Protection Measures and Recommendations
21



(1) During construction impoverished wasted lands shall be utilized to the
greatest extent during consideration of borrowing soil, and the acquisition
of caltivated lands shall be minimized by adoption o; the methods of
deepening and enlarging water channels , leveling lands and utilization of
river beds according to actual situation and at the same time avoiding waste
of water and loss of soil , Wasted earth , stones and dregs shall not be
discarded every where , especially these shall not be discarded on the
surface of slopes and ditches . During construction of side slopes,
vegetations along the route shall be restored in time in order to reduce waste
of water and loss of soil.
(2) The construction sites shall be equipped with sprinklers in order to
reduce dust pollution, and at the same time the transport velhicles shall be
covered with canvas so as to avoid scattering of construction materials aind
dusts.
(3) The lime soil mixing plant shall be located on leeward and withiin the
range of 200m there should be no large in habitant areas or environment
sensitive areas , and attentions shall be given to workers protection
measures.
(4) Attentions shall be given to rational layout of construction site
Machineries shall b'- arranged 200m beyond the concentrated in habitant
areas . Repairs and maintenance of construction equipment and vehicles
shall be enhanced and the transport passage shall be selected I OQm beyond
the concentrated in habitant areas .
(5) It is suggested that the construction units rationally arrange construction
time according to actual situations on the site . Within the range of 22:00-
6:00 high noise machineries shall be stopped . If they need to work during
this period of time, approval shall be given first.
(6) It is suggested that new in habitant areas, schools -and hospitals etc
sensitive points should not be built within 50m of traffic pollution.
5. Evaluation Conclusion
5.1 The present intercomnecting Toad environment quality
The agricultural ecology is the mainstay of this area. There are no rare
22



animals and plants and the underground water quality is good . The acoustic
environment background values along the route are low and the present CO
and NO, concentrations are over the state atmospheric environment quality
class II standard . Therefore , the overall level of the present environment
quality of the interconnecting road is good.
5.2 Construction period
The damaged regulations shall be restored . And practical and feasible
measures shall be taken for construction noise and dusts due to transport
vehicles so as to protect the health of workers and in habitants along the
route .
5.3 Operation period
Temporarily acquired lands must be returned to cultivation in order to
reduce waste of water and loss of soil . Since that the traffic volumes of tllis
section are small , the traffic noise and atmospheric pollution due to vehicle
emission in the medimn and far future are not serious . Tlerefore , the
pollution factors can meet the requirements of relevant state atmosphenrc
quality standards . No environment protection measures are needed .
Based on the above analysis , the construction of the interconnectina
road will not cause serious adverse impacts to surrounding enviroment
Therefore , from the point of view of environment , the construction is
feasible and the advantages out weight the disadvantages .

3. - Environiment Impacts Prediction and Evaluation
3.1.   Natural Environment
This project is for pavement betterment on the basis of existing class II
road in order to raise pavement standard, therefore , this project has little
influence to natural land forn and terrain of the area along the route. The
construction teams are relatively small in size comparative to new projects
with small bill of quantities . The construction waste water and sewage from
living quarter will not cause influence to surface water, at the same time,
the short term construction causes little impacts little to agricultural
irrigation system and waste of water and loss of soil erosion along the
route.
3.2. Social Environment
(1)   Because this is a pavement betterment project, there will be no land
acquisition and building demolition which will not affect the people's lives
along the route . the implementation of this project will greatly-improve the
traffic condition of Zannan highway and transportation environment and will
reduce traffic congestion and traffic accidents . At the same time it will also
29



promote the economic development of the areas in Shahe and Nanhe
counties along the route so as to solve the settlement of surplus labors and
raise. the people's living standards . The project will also promote the
industries development such as energy , telecommunication . culture -
education and hygienic which will guaranitee the planining of economic
development and the objective of GNP 8 billion RMB in the year 2000
(2) Land acquisition and reallocation
The total lands qcquired for intercomnecting roads amount to 456.1 inu,
of which cultivated lands 244.3 mu, demolished houses 6712m2 which are
all village houses. In order to minimize affected people the alignment mnahes
full use of existing roads so as to avoid large areas of demolition and
resettlement. Land acquisition and demolition offices have been set Lup at
each level in the highway constryction sectors and detailed resettlement
plans have been made for this project.
3.3. Acoustic Enviromnent
3.3.1 Acoustic enviromnent analysis during construction stage (refer to

3.3.2. Acoustic environrment analysis during operational stage
(1)  Prediction model (refer to Cixian - Linzhang Interconnecting Road
EIA , 3.3.2 (1))
(2)   Analysis have been made on the basis of the details of the project in
order to determine the parameters of traffic noise sources , speed and
road structures . By computation , the traffic noise prediction values
in different years of the proposed highway are shown in table 3-6.3-

From the above prediction data it shows that the main sensitive points in
each operation stage have not surpass the standards in accordance with
" Both Sides of Trunk Highway " standard . In light of "Class II Mixed
Areas " standard, in the medium and far period during the operational stage,
only at Sansi village inhabitant districts , it slightly surpasses the standard
1.3 - 2.7 dB(A) . Others are in accordance with the standards . During each
operational stage the distance to meet the standards at day time is within 1 0
m and 20m-40 m at night . Therefore , traffic noise during operational stage
of the proposed caused little impacts to the areas at both sides of the route .

Note: "v" stands for being in acorance with the standard.
The above prediction data show that CO and NO, concentrations in each
evaluation year 10 meters from the road are in accordance with class 11
environmerLt quality standard (in the far period NO, 20 meters ) which has been
regulated by the state . Atmospheric environment quality at the main sensitive
Points along the route meets the state atmospheric class II standard . CO and
NOx pollutants emitted by vehicles cause little effects to atmospheric
environment along the route . In the fiture , as the improvement of vehicle
finctions and gasoline gradients , pollution caused by vehicle to atmosphere
will be reduced to less extent and the influence will be minimized.
4. Environmental Protection Measures and Suggestions
4.1   Environmental protection measures and suggestions - in construction
stage
(1)  If there are resident districts around the construction site , the
construction time shall be controlled . And construction will be prollibited
from 22:00 -6:00 at night to guarantee the residents' rest.
35



(2) The construction site selection (especially large size mixing plants
shall be arranged 200 metres beyond the residents' areas . The transport
passage shall be selected 1100 metres beyond the residents' areas.
(3)  The construction site shall be equipped with sprinklers and the
transport vehicles shall be covered with convas cloth.
4.2  Environmental Protection Measures and Suggestions in operational
stage
(1)  The construction departments shall coordinate with other governments
departmelnts and planning departnent to carry out environmenital protection
consciousness publicity . Within 50 meters at the both sides of the road
school , hospital and resident areas etc. shall not be set up .
(2)  Relevant highway environmental protection regulations shall be
perfected and vehicle exhaust gases sampling system shall be carried out
and the disqualified vehicles are prohibited.
(3) Monitoring shall be carried out in each year for Sansi village to take
command of environmental situation.
5. Environment Conclusion
Agricultural ecology is the main form of natural environment, there
are no rare animals , plants along the route . The existing roads are left
behind and acoustic environment and atmospheric environment status quo
along the route are good .
During construction noise and atmospheric pollutants will be caused
due to the works and the original traffic regulations will be disordered .
Powerful measures and scientific management shall be property taken to
guarantee the health of surrounding inhabitants .
During the operation period little influence will be caused to acou-stic
and atmospheric enviromnent at both sides of the route . The improvement
of transportation environment will 'facilitate the improvement of the
environment along the route from macroscopic points of view .

are very good witlh large capacity .
3.  Enviroiunent 1inpact Prediction and Evaluation
3.1  National Environiment Impact Analvsis
The impact to natural environment by construction of the intercoiunectillnT
road are mainly shown in two aspects: farm land acquisition and loss of
water and erosion of soil .
Highway constructioni will have to acquire some lands and make a
corridor on the flat and spacious lands . The contractors whose land have
been occupied will certainly have some losses in economy , however
through the land adjustnent by the govenmment or arrangement of jobs for
these contractors , they will be compensated or even their lives will be
improved . The agricultural production losses due to land acquisitions are
small comparative to the whole districts because of the short highway
mileage (only 11.4 ln ) , however, the great development which has been
brouglt to this districts by the construction of highway are immeasurable .
The interconnecting road is located in plain areas with silt clay soil . The
earth work will amount to 2857 m3 . Therefore, attentions shall be given to
minimizing the loss of water and erosion of soil during constructioni . If the
construction period is allowed, construction in July and August whiclh are
concentrated with rainfalls shall be avoided . At the same time , the borrow
pits and waste area shall be covered , and after the construction is over the
site shall be returned for cultivation in order to avoid soil erosion .
3.2 Social Environment Impact Analysis
(1)   There are two districts and seventeen counties (cities ) iunder the
441



jurisdiction of Xingtai city wvhich is the centre of politics , economy and
culture . The constructioni of the proposed road will make a solution to the
exist problem of Xingtai city. Which will make a good traffic foiundation for
future development and will also make a good promotion for outbotund
economic development anid the strategy of cooperation in the east and
development in the west. The construction of the hlighway will also mititate
the urban area entrance traffic congestion and the velhicles which will go on
Slii-An Expressway will no longier pass through the urban areas . And the
traffic flows of the south industrial districts of Xingtai city will be diverted .
(2) Land acquisition and reallocation
The total lands acquired for this project amount to 565 mu,of which
cultivated lands 471.5 mu and demolished houses 420m2, therefore, the
numbers of acquired lanids and demolished houses are small. The lives of the
affected farmers will not be in fluenced to great extent under the overall
arrangements by the constraction departenets.

(2) Based on the traffic volume prediction values as well as the higlhwav
main teclhical index , terrain , land form characteristics, each parameter in
the model has been carefully selected and determined . Prediction
computations have been made on traffic noise during operation period and

1.5  Analysis of Major Enviroinmenital Impact Factors:
Certailn impact on natural environrment as well as social envir-onllimelit
would be caused duriiig the design, construction and operationi of tile
project. Major negative impact of the project engineering activities ol1 the
enviroinmenit along the project aligunient are as follows:
Desigin pilase: Demolition and remiloval and resettlemenit of residenits. cliiam- 
to current status of land r esource;
ConstrUCtiol plhase: Clhanges of natural enviroinmenlt along the aligniinent (dtic
to en,ginieering activities,  occupation of farm land, alnd construictioni iloise
and pollutioll;
Operation phase: Emission of tail exhaust due to traffic flow and traffic n1oise.
2. CURRENT STATUS OF ENVIRONMENT AND ENVIRONMENTAL
ASSESSMENT
2. 1  Curienit Statius of Natur-al Envir-onimenit:
Thie project area is located at the north of Xingtai City and the east ol'
Taihang Mountain  Mountainious area, rolliiig terrain and plain accounit



seperately for 42%, 30% and 28% of the county's total area. Neiqiu Counly
belongs to continenital climate of temperate zone . The soil resotiu-ce.
basically clay i naiture, is abundant along the alignment.
Agricultire is dominant along the project area with some deci(dtiotis
broadleaf trees scattered over the vast plain. Rare aniimals and plants llavc
not beeni found in this area.
2.2 Current Status and Analysis of Social Environiment
Neiqiu Counity, where the project is located, lias an area of 775 sq.klm
in whichi, 276,000 mui is cultivated land, The total poptilation s 250,0(0) in
1995, 2 10,200 of wilichi is agricultural populationi, and 39,800 is non11-
agricultural. Coal mining and chemical fertilizer are the main induistries.
Sorghum, sweet potato and whieat accouLit for lhalf of the growing area.
Cotton is the major cash crop. On the basis of agricultural developimient
forestry, animal husbandly and side occupation are also greatly encouraged.
Thie 1995 GNP is 584 million yuan. The average increase is 33.4%o
anuually during the Eighithi Five Year Plan, In the Ninthi Five Year P'lall anid
by the year 201 0, Neiqiu County, still keeping agriculture as the mainistay,
will focus its attentioni oni the development of townslip enterprises in order
to speed up industrializationi and urbanization. It is estimated that, by 2000.
the GNP will reach 1310 million yuan, with an anuLual increase rate ol
23.4%, and will remain an increase of 15% from the year 2000 on. By 20 1 0,
the GNP will reach 4608 million yuan.
2.3  CurTent Status and Analysis of Noise Environiment:
Several small villages along the interconunecting are directly carousel.
Silce the road is only 6.2 km long, two monitoring stations were set ulp at
Dalianig Village anid Xizhangmna Village. The results (1#: 42.6dB in the dav
time and 38.6dB at night; 2#: 47.0dB in the day time and 44.0dB at ni1i1t X
show that the noise level is below the standards (for class II mixed area, time
standaid is 6OdB(A) for the day time and 5OdB(A) for the niglt).
2.4  Current Status and Assessmeint of Atmosplheric Environimeit:
Sinice this linkage road is far from cities and towns, there I no reguilar
monitoring records for this area. Therefore, two monitoring stations were set
up (at the same locations as the noise monitoring stations). The IniOnitorilnt
results are: 1# daily average density is 0.97mig/Nm3 for CO and
54



0.01 9ing/Nm' for NO,, 2#: daily average density is I .30mg/Nmn' for CO allnd
0.024mg/Nn-' for NO,.
The uLpper- linit set by the Provinicial Envir-onimiienital Protectioll Ii cauI
is 4.00nmg/n3 for Co and 0. 10mg/Orn' for NO,. By coinparison, the densis ol
CO and NO, along the )roject area is below the standar-ds.
3. FORECAST AND ASSESSMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACVF
3.1  Assessment of Impact on Natural Environimenltal:
Digging and filling of thie groulid are uniavoidable for highiway projects.
so the construictioni activities will clhange the original natural landscape and land
surface in a certain degree.
The impacts of the project oii agriculture ecology are mainly cause(d by
pennanent land acquisition and chiange of irrigation system. Althloughl kindC
resource is abundanit in Nortlh Clhina Plain, the average land per capita is (qiuite
low taking Clhina as a whole. It is the State policy to protect eachi inclc  ol
cultivated land, so the project shoUld try to avoid cultivated land or try to
acquire ctiltivated land as little as possible. The constrtictioni of higihlways will
also influemice the originial iirigation systems. To reduce the impact on tlis, it Is
important to try to avoid wells and irTigationi canals duLing alignillelit :selection,
anid to allow enouglh culveits and overpasses to guarantee the normnal operatlio
of irrigationl systems.
3.2   Assessment of Impact on Social Environmnent:
(I )Improvement of the existing highiway shiall greatly improve tratfic
conditionis, enhiance social economic development and raise people's 1ivilnt
standard. Econiomic development could solve the problem  of farni surpltis
labor.
(2)With tile improvemiienit of transportationi conditions, tradinig betwveen
country and city will be lacilitated, thius turninig the abunidant agriciltiLual and
sideline products into commodities, satisfy'ing tile needs of city liliabitants aln
increasing the income of thie villagers.
At thle same tine, development of transportation can also hielp develop
infrastiictiue like energy, telecommuniicationi, culture, educationi as well as
hiygiene course, thuddinig improvinig the quality of people's life.
55



(3) Land acquisitioni and reallocation
The total laids acquired amount to 233.04 mu ,of whIich cultivated lands
201.24 mu and demolislied hLouses 7872.577m2, Regarding the Land
acquisition and demolition,compensations shiall be lianided out ini accordanwce
with the relevant documents issued by provincial govenimenit, prefecturial
and counity departments so as to guaranitee the living standards of tlle
affected people.

4. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION MEASURES AND
RECOMMENDATIONS
61



4.1  Measures and Recoimimienidationis for Construction Pliase:
(1)Waste land shiould be used as muchi as possible for bol-ow  pits.
Effective measures should be taken to decrease sil erosioni. No waste earith or
stones shoUld be discarded at ranidom.  Vegetationi sh.ould be recovered in
time.
(2) Construction and operationi of plants shiould stop during the rest time ol'
local residents.  Conistrtiction is not allowed from 22:00 to 6:00 to ensure tilat
local residents could have good rest.
(3) Storage of constrtictioni plants is better to be at 200m away (downwind(
direction) from the living quarters of local residents.
(4) Water spriniiers shiall be provided at the construction site to reduce
dust pollution.  trucks for transporting construction  materials shiall be covered
with covering materials to avoid leakage.
4.2   Measures and Recoimnendationis at Operation Phase:
(1) Since the village of Dialiang is near to the proposed project(abouLt 50
metres), it is recommended to strengthien the monitoring of noise anid
atmosphere during the operation phase, and adopt measures according to the
nonitoring results;
(2)It is recommended that no new schools, residential quarters or lhospitals
be built withliin 50m at botlh side of the proposed road.
5.   CONCLUSION
5.1  CurTent Status of Enviroinmental Quality:
Natural envirotunenit in the project area is simple.  Agricultural ecology
takes the leading role. There is no rare animals or plants fotnd. Theere ar-e 0lo
major industrial or mining enterprises due to poor communications . Currenit
status of sounLd enviromnent is fine and so is the air environimental quality.
5.2  Construction Pliase:
Since damage to surface vegetation is unavoidable during construction
62



phase, it is important to recover it after constructioni. Proper measuri-es shaill
have to be taken to deal with noise and TSP produced by constnictioni activities
so as to ensule the healtlh of local residents and constntctionl workers.
5.3 Operation Pliase:
Land must be retumned to farming as soon as possible after construlction.
Greening must be done to -reduce erosion of soil along the road. For Villake of'
Dialiang, wlich is near to the road, it is recommended to adopt some nmeastires.
namely hiiglh fence walls and planting trees and othler managemenlt technliulle. lo
reduce noise and air pollutioni.
In a word, the proposed project will certainly facilitate tihe social
economic development of the project area, and at the same time, will impose
certain impact on thie environment. However, if the above recommendations al-e
observed strictly, pollution caused by constructioni and vehicles can be avoided.
So the  Neiqiu  lnterchainge  Interconniiecting  Road  is feasible  lri-oii  tile
environmental point of view.

2. CURRENT STATUS OF ENVIRONMENT AND
ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
(,7



2.1   Current Status of Natural Environment
The Project area belongs to alluvial plaini of Tailiang Mountain witlh
low and flat terrain inclininig from the nortlhwest to southeast. Natural fall ol'tllis
area is 0.1 percent and the elevatioin is 25-35in.    The Project area belongs
to conitinenital climate of temperate zone with the annual average temperaturi-e of
12.5°C and the annual average precipitation of 488.40mnm  which usLuallv
happens from Jule to August. Maximum freezing depth is 53cm with a fieezing
period of 70 days and noni-frost period of 95 days.
Feasibility Study slhows that the seismic intensity of this area is 7.
Conditions of grouLnd surface are fine since soil types are distinguislhed as
sandy soil and loam.
2.2   Current Status and Analysis of Social Environment
2.2.1 Current Status of Social Environment
The Project locates in Ningjin County at the nortlheast of Xingtai City.
Area directly influtenced is 1107 sq.km and population directly affected is
700,000. Area of cultivated land influenced is 822 sq.lcm.  AbuLldanit iII
natLral resources, crops of Ningnin County are various with the major ones
are wheat, corn, millet, Chinese sorghum, cottoin and peanut. Furtlhenirore,
this cotunity is also the production base of wheat anid good quality pears. Stone
pile, wlhich has been exploited, is the main mineral resource anid its reserve is
rich. lindustries in this cotnty incltude processing of farm by-products, electric
cables, constructioni materials, machinery processing,  costume, clotlh and
cheemistries, etc with prominent economy of townslhip enterprises. In the yeal
1995, the gross natural product (GNP) was RMB Y 1750 million and gross
output value of industry over township level was RMB Y 625 millioln.
2.2.2 Conditions of Existing Traffic and Suspending Problems
Since there is no railway in Ningjin County, transportationi of passengel-
and freight mainly rely on lighways. Nationial higlhways in this COuLnty inclutde
NH  308, provincial highways include Ning-Chang Highway and cotilitv
higliways include Ning-Gao Higlhway and Ning-Xin Highway. Road netwol-k
has been fonned and' each township is accessible to paved road villages
accessible to paved roads have reached 80%. Yet standard of the existing r oad
is low and conditions are poor wlhich cause severe traffic congestioni and
accident. Tlbus, constructioni of traffic infrastnmcture is the only way to solve
the existing problem.

2.2.3       Cultural Relics
Feasibility Study shows that there are no major remains of cultural relics
discovered along the Project area.
2.3       Current Status and Analysis of Noise Envir-oniment
Tlhere are no relativel)  laiger enterprises along  the project arca.   Thie

III. FORECAST AND ASSESSMENT OF ENVIRONMENNTAL
IMPACT
3.1    Assessment of Natural Environmental Impact
Sinice the project is to improve and expand the existing Class Ill
Higlhway, there slhall not be muclh impact of engineering activities on the natural
terrain and topography of the project area. Yet waste water as well as sewvage
water produced by the administration of construction and living of constructioni
team shall caiuse pollution to surface water.  As far as bridge structures are
concerned, pollution to river water could be avoided if construction behavior- is
controlled. There would be no apparent change to the quality of river water due
to the small amounit of sewage water produced by the living of construtctioln
teams and the impact is temporary. Thouglh some fann land would be occupie(d
because of the expansioni of the existing road, there would not be much imnpact
on the agricultural irrigation system  since the amount of land occupation is
small. Impact on soil erosion is small, too.
3.2      Assessment of Social Environmental Impact

(1) improvemenit of the existing lighiway slhall greatly improve Wraflc
conditions, enhdance social economic development and raise people's livilng
standard. Economic develop,Lmenit could solve tile problem of fann surplus labolr
At the  same  time, development of eniergy, lelecommniujication. ciliurl-C.

be beautified.   Occupationi ol farmn land and demolition of structules silil I)c
as less as possible. Based on the NO. 117 DOCUMENT of the pi-ovilnce.
detailed compensation and resettlement plan have been drwan wiichi shall nlot
influenice the living of people affected.
(2)  Land acquisition and reallocation
The total lands acquired for this project amount to 701.3 inu,of \vhic1

emission is little oni air enivironmenlt. Along with the economic development of
the Nine-Five-Year Plani, improvement of truck performance as well as
petroleum  particles would reduce the amount of tail emission . Thus it is
considered that tail emission shall have almost no impact on the atmospheric
environimenit of the project area.
IV.  ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION MEASURES AND
RECOM M ENDATIONS
4.1     Environmental Protection Measures and Recommendations for
Construction Phase
77



(1) It is recommended that the Emnployer as well as the Contractors inake
reasonable plan for operation of constrmctioni plants based onl actLial site
conditions.  Constructioni and operation of plants should stop during the rest
time of local residents.  Construction is not allowed from 22:00 to 6:00 to
ensure that local residents could have good rest.
(2) Layout of construction site sliould be reasonable. Storage. of
constructioni plants is better to be at 200m  away from the living quarter-s of
local residents.   Maintenance of vehicles for transportationi slhall be
strenigtlhened. Access road for transportationi slhall be 1OOmn away li-omil (lie
living quarters of local residenlts.
(3)it is recommended that rotational work manner be adopted so as workers
involved in noise-related work could recover.
(4) Lime mixinig station shall be located within 200m at downwinid direction
wlhere thiere is no major living quarter of local residenits nor sensitive poinlts.
(5) Water sprinklers shall be provided at the construction site to reduce dust
pollution.  trucks for transportinig construction materials shall be covered witl
covering materials to avoid leakage.
(6)Waste land should be used as much as possible for borrow pits. Effective
mneasures should be taken to decrease sil erosion. No waste earth or stones
should be discarded at random.  Vegetationi should be recovered in timle.
4.2     Environmental Protection Measures and Recommendatioins at
Operationi Phase
(l)lt is recommended that no new schools, residential quarters or hospitals
be built withiln 50m at both side of the proposed road.
(2) it is also recommended that regulations of highway envirolnllielntal
protection be established and sampling detection system on tail emissioll be
adopted. Non-qualified vehicles shall not be allowed to enter onto the road.
(3) Monitoring on the central residential quarters of Hequ Townshiip shall
be carried out by year  and relevant measures shall be taken based on special
conditions.
78



V. CONCLUSION
5.1    Current Status of Environmental Quality withlinl Assesse(d Area
Nattiral environmenit in tihe project area is simple.  Agricultural ecolouy
takes the leading role. There is no i-are animiials or plants foulid. There are ino
major industrial or mininig enterprises due to poor communicationis . Ciriei
status of soutnd enviroimnenit is fine and so is the air environimental qualitat.
5.2    Envir-onmental Impact at Construction Phase
Proper iiieasuires shall have to be taken to deal withi noise anict  SP
produced by construictioni activities so as to ensuire the lhealtlh of local resi(lenits
and constructionl workers.
5.3    Environmental Imnpact at Operation Phase
There shall be little impact of noise and air enviroliment whlen operalioln
starts. Yet constructioll of sensitive structures within 50m at bothi side ol lie
road shouild be controlled.  Generally speaking, constructioni of the proposed
interconiectling road shall improve the environment alonigside.

1. PROJECT DESCRIPTION
1.1. Constniction Significanice
Tlhis connecting line, located at the east exit of Shlijiazhtuang Cit, is a
portion of the No. 307 National Trnlik Higliway conunecting with Gaochells'.
Jinzhou, etc. to the east and eniding at Huanghlua Port. This interconnecting roadl
will furtlher coniect Sliijiazhuang - Taiyuan, Beijing-Sliijiazliuang and
Shijiazhuang-HuawgHua Port Expressways. Meanwlile, it will rationalize tlle
urban transport network in Shijiazhulang by avoiding transit traffic at nortli-east
and nortli-west sides of thie city to use inner city roads.
With the developmnent of the society and the economy, the anlual average
daily increase of traffic amount lhas far exceeded the traffic capacity of this a-oii
wlhichi as a result has become a section of the Shi-Ganig Higlhway hlaving tlhe
heaviest traffic amount. With thie increase of the traffic amotunt, the pavement of
some individual sections has been seriously damaged and defects suchl as
tortoise cracks, swells etc., have appeared and have resulted in the degradation
of the service standard of the road and the maintenance expenses.
Shijiazlhanig City, togetlher with Qinhutiangdao, Tangslian and Cangzloti
cities located on the line arounid Bohai Bay, was approved by the State CouLncil
as the Open-to-outside Development Zone Around the Bolhai Bay. 'Ilie
executioni of this Project slhall sliorten the land distance between Shijiazluang
and Huaniglhua Port and possesses a significant role in the improvement of the
investment enviromnent, expansioni of the Open-to-outside-world and in the
promotion of the econiomic development. At the same time anotlher exit towards
the east fromn Shijiazlhuanig is to be opened due to the execution of thle project,
wlhich, having connected Jing-Slhen Expressway with Shi-Ganig Expressway
(No.307 National Trunk Road), shall perform a very significant function in the
perfection of the road network layout and the sufficienit development of tlhe
efficiency of Slii-An Expressway.

1.5 Project Investment and Work Period Program
This project involves a total investment of 150.437 million Yuani (in wllich
57.224863 million yuan is loan from the World Banki anid 93.211779 million
yuan is raised by the Province). The average cost is 13.837 million Yuani pel-
kin .
The project is scheduled to commence work in 1997 withl a work period of two
years and is schieduled to open to traffic simultanieously with Shi-Ail
Expressway in 1999.
2. Conditioni of the Environiienit
2.1. Natural Environimenlt
The works plamied to be construicted is located in the North Chilia Plains area
to the south-east of Slhijiazhuanig City where the terrain is flat witil all elevation
difference of less thian 20 mi. Most of the area is alluvial and pluvial suiface
withi its climate being the subtropical continental monsoon climate and the
anmual average temperature at 12.8 "C. The ainual sunsliine time is 2,5641hours,
the average amotunt of precipitationi is 500 millimeters whichi mainly
concentrates in the period between Junle and Auguist. The iio-frost period is 190
days and tie- maximuLi 'freezing depth is 53 cm.  Sufficient sunsiiline is
available and the wind direction changes very obviously with the change of tile
seasons. Winter sees nonrally north and north-west winds while.in the other-
seasons mostly the wind is soutil-west to south-east wind. The wind velocity is
nionnally around 2 m / second.
The geological structure of the area where the project is located belongs to tihe
Neo-Huaxia Family rift structure and thie earthquake strength is in the range of
stable area.
The rivers in this area are mostly seasonal wide alignment rivers which are dry-
or have little water amounit in usually times while in rain season flood withl slow
flow. Due to the draught in the recent years which has resulted in the
intemiption of water, soine of the rivers have become fann fields and nlow In
tlhe area where the line scheduled to be coniected goes through there is no mlore
river.
2.2. Social Environment
Sliijiazhiuanig City, the center of Hebei Province, located in the middle southl of
83



Hebei Province, is 300 kilometers away from Bolhai to the east witlh Hen-gsliii
and Cangzhou in betweenl and conniected with Shaanxi Province, tlle Coal Base
to the west. Adjacent to Xingtai and Handanl to the soutlh, it is connected oii lihe
nortlh witlh Beijing and Tianjin the two cities directly under thie Cewtral
Government. Shijiazhuang City is the ceniter city of the middle soutli area ol
Hebei Province and the soutlhern area of North Chlilla. It is also the center oi
politics, economy, science and technology, finance, trading, cultur e aiid
infonnation of Hebei Province. Under its jurisdictioni are six districts. 12
counties and 5 COuInty level cities. Thie land area of SlhijiazlLuanig is 14,077
square kilometers and the total population at the end of 1994 was 8,356,000
Slhijiazhuanig city is abunidanit in economic founldationi and finie In agrictllill-al
foundationi. Wlheat and corn are abulndantly maniufactured lhere and its strulcttre-c
layout of the industrial production enterprises is reasonable. Witlh the coal.
chemical, meclhanical, cemienit and textile industries as the main bod) ol its
industry, SliijiazhualLg is a textile industry base of Clhina.
At present, Shijiazlhuaing has formed its comprehensive transportation systemn
involving railways, higlhways and air-transportationi. The llighways ruln
transversely and longittudinially into a network with the No. 308, No. 107
National Trunik Roads, Jing-Slhen Expressway and Jing-Huai Road rm1iIimInm.
nortlh to soutlh and No. 307 National Higlhway, Shi-Tai Grade I Motor Way and
the Provincial Zlieng-Rao Road in the direction of east and west. So far a
higlhway transportationi network witlh the main skeleton of National and
Provincial Highways and the counLty anid township roads as the      lias
been fonned. The air transportation started relatively late and in this area tlhere
are ShiiiazlLuaiig Airport and Daguocuni Airport and Gaocheng Airport.
2.3. Situation of the Sound and Atmosphere Envirounment
The sounld and atmosplhere environmental situation of thle area wlhere ilhe
Shijiazlhuaing East Exit Connectinig Line is scheduled to go tllrouglh is as slhowvn
in the following tables:

Taixi cun          .       0.023      0.016 r     1.51     0.211
Judging from the data shown in the above tables, it can be coincluded that the
sound environmental quality in the area where the road scheduled to be
constructed is relatively good and the majority of the residents along thle linie
have a relatively quiet coniditioii of workinig, studying, livinig and resting. Trle
enviroimnental noise does not exceed the relevant Stanidard as specified ill tile
GB3096-83 Urban Area Enivironmenital Noise Standard . Since the area whei-e
the road sclheduled to be constructed goes tlhrough is located in the countryside
and there are not many fixed pollution sources along the route, the
enviromnenital quality of the atmosplhere is relatively good witlh the moniitol
value of SO2, NO,, CO and TSP conforming with the Grade II Standard of the
atmosphere quality. With the fine quality of the sound and atmosphere quality.
it is easy for this area to provide a good conditioni for the developmenit awii
construction of the higlhway project.
2.4. Statistics oni Sensitive Spots along the Line
The comnecting line scheduled to be constructed is located in the countryside in
the east part of Shijiazlhuaiig and the alignment of Shijiazliuang Nortl
Interchawg Interconnecting Road has mostly avoided the big villages,_only Tixi
cun locates in the scope of evaluation .
3. Analysis on1 Enviroinmental Affects
3.1. Analysis onl the Natural Envirolnmenital Affects
3.1.1. Effects on Agricultural Ecotype by Engineering Construction
This project is a Grade I Motorway of 4 lanes. At the designing and selection of
the line, attention was paid to keep the line away from towns and large villages.
Since the subgrade to be constructed mostly goes througlh the farm land, thie
agricultural productioni is to be affected to some extent with the adverse affects
mainly cominig from the occupation of pennanent land. In a short tenn, the grain
productioni income of the village of which the land is occupied shall be affected
to some extent. However, since the line is relatively short, this affect is
relatively slight compared against the whole area and in addition the farmers
85



whose land is- occupied shall be compensated by the township authority thloulgh l
necessary land adjustment or land compensation fee which may be used by thle
farmers to develop niew enterprises. As it is knowni by everyone, developiiieni
of transportation is thie foundation on wliclh the economy can take ol'.
Constructioni of higliways shall greatly promote the developmelnt ol ilhe
economy of the whole. area and sufficiently -guarantee the transportation
fundamental facility as necessary for the development of productioll of
agricultural products and the processing industry. Job chanices slhall also. be
increased and thus the development of the local agricultural economy shall be
promoted to a iighler level. The chlange of the utilizationi of the land resouirce
value shall be realized and the benefits broughlt in this way slhall be far bigge-
tlhan that by the compenisationi for the adverse afTect of the land occupalionl. it
shall lead the development of the wliole area.
Since the area where the coinnectinig line is located is a fann land area wllich
have been developed for many years, there is no wild animals.
3.1.2. Analysis on the Soil Erosion
Soil erosioni is a geological calamity of the serious loss of land surface soil anid
the fragnentary weathered rock substances resulting from the water-l-low
geological function. Serious soil erosion is. mainly resulting fiom  the
complicated natural environiment and geological conditionis and the long-ter-
abuse of the land resources. At present the deterioration of the soil erosion is
mainly due to the artifact activities suchl as aimless reclamation, land
reclamation, uncontrolled lumbering and husbanidry, engilleering activities
againist the geological regularities, destruction of forest and grassland, and loss
of stability of the vegetation mountaini rocks and so on.
This conniecting line is located on North Chiina Plains with flat terraiin, smiiall
amotunt of rain water, complete coverage of fanning operations and low
highway subgrade. After it is completed, basically no large scale soil erosion
shall occur, but attention should be paid to the fonnation of the side slope
vegetation and the replantinig on the borrow and deposit areas.
The soil erosion problem mainly happens in the constructioni period duL-inig
which due to the operations of borrow  fill and slope preparation, the
topography and the land features shall be altered Lunavoidably and thus the
vegetation slhall be damaged. However, since the work period is slhort aiid the
damage degree is limited, the soil erosion amouint can be controlled to the
minimum if the following measures are taken:
86



(1) Construction of the - ligh-fill and deep-excavation sections shiolii(i he
reasonably programmed to avoid being arranged in rain season especially in lhe
heavy rain period.
(2) Excavationi of the soil sh.ould be executed with the miethiod of platfoi dI (litclh
type soil bOITOw and randoirm excavation along the slope is strictly prolibited.
(3) In the process of earth- fill, as large amounot of the surrounding vegetationi as
possible should be kept undamaged and restoration of the vegetatioln in tihe riz hlt
of way shiould be maniaged simultaieously With the Construction  ol tihe
highway.
(4) Earthwork and stone work should be reasonably adjusted between chli
other anid the coticenltrated borir ow area with appropriate amounit of borrow  i lll
should be located otn waste land as the priority. The borrow anid deposit arcas
shiould be planted in time or covered with othler types of coverage to avoid soil
erosionl.
(5) Soil side slope of large area shouild be protected withi stones, retaini wall or
surf.
3.2. Analysis on the Social Influenice
(1) This connectinig line shall coninect Shijiazhiuanig, capital of Hebei Provinice
with the eastern cities of HIengsiutti, Cangzhou, and Huanighiua lPort andl the
center cities of Hebei Provinice. As an important circle in the Provincial
Highway Network, it is goiig to funiction as a comprehenisive transportat ioi
chaninel.
(2) Land acquisition and Reallocation
The total lanids acquired for Slhijiazhuanig North Interchanlge Interconnectinie
Road amoulit to 950.26 mu, cultivated land 926.02 mu and demolished hlotise
1492 m2. Land acquisition anid demolition offices hlave been set up at eachi level
by the construCtioni agencies, and detailed resttlement plans have been made otit,
overall arTangineits and full coordinatiolis were worked out. Compensations
for land acquisitioni and deinolitions will follow relevant documents issue(d hv
provincial govenmnent and city gonernunents so that the living standards ofll tle
affected people will not be inifluenced to a great extent.

3.3 Prediction of the Sound Environmenit ol1 the Sensitive Spots
The future noise levels are predicted by means of energy superpOsition ol hlie
predicted traffic noise and the current background value in associationl withl thie
decreasing affect by the topography and the geophysical buildinigs of  sensitive
spots.
Tile housinig feature of Hebei Province is that each family lhas its own
separate courtyard with highi walls and a single gate. Througlh site exploration.
it is noted that villages along thie project are reasoniably designed. The streets
are well laid out and thie walls of almost eachi courtyard are 3 meters high. The
houses by the streets are all 2 story buildings witlh lhigli walls between tileni.
This design has conlected the streets, h1ouses and courtyard inlto rows wlicil
lhave quite fine screen fuLnctioni. One gate in a certain  distance runsl
longitudinally into eachi of the courtyard. Site exploration indicates that the
houses by the streets and the highi walls functioln as very good noise barrier
against the noisy streets due to the reasonable design and lay-out and, therefore,
inside the village, it is very qttiet. The noise level of the locatioli wlhere it is in a
distanice of three rows of houses fiom the streets is approximately 5 dB lowver
than that ol1 the streets and the noise level in thie courtyard of the residents is
even lower thani that il tlhe village.

From the conicilisioii of the predictioni oni the atmosphiere environment quality it
can be figured out that after the highway is completed, in the middle aild far
service period the amount of NO, contained in the atmosplhere and( tlle
distances are detailed in the above table. However, the density of CO ill eachl

stage of the seivice period sliall conforiml withi the bid evaltiationi standard.
3.4.3. Evaluationi oni the Atimiosphiere Aflect oni the Sensitive Spots
There a is one sensitive spots and one Nos. sensitive spot alonig tihe two rotle.
Taixicun are 120 meters away ftrom the road and are beyond the standard ii me
of atmospliere quality. Thierefore, the atmosphiere affect oln thle spots sh 11 ilot
exceed the standaid in eacih stage of the service period
4. Enivironimenital Protection Measures and Recominendationis
4. 1. Environimilemital Protection Measures and Recommenidations in thle Desieii
Period
(1) At the designinlg of the route, attentioni shlould be paid to the nimIinimum
occupation of thie cultivable land and the route sliould be located as lahr as
possible away from the large environimenital sensitive spots. Comprelhenssive
considerationi should be takeni of the alignimienit as well as the coistriuctioin
layout of the Shijiazhiuanig City Overall Desigin and LiangcuLn Developmnct
Zone so as to avoid the possible conflict.
(2) Trees whiichi suit the local climate and soil should be selected ior the (lesign 
of greenery.
(3) The living and productioni conditionis ol tlhe houselholds who are affected( hy
the removal lor land acquisitioll shouild be well arranged so as to best miaal.1lC
not to redUce the livinig anid prodLictioll conditionis of them.
(4) Sites of lime soil mixing plant, stone quarry, borrow area, and debris deposit
area should be selected in sucih a manner that they are located far away fionm I lie
large scale residenitial area, schools or other envir-onimenital sensitive spots so as
to avoid tile affect oin population's healthi by the lime soil.
4.2. Enviroilnental Protection  Measures and  Recommendationis  in  tihe
Constr-tuction Period
(1) Utilization of the land acqulired shiould be reasoniably plainned so {S to
reduce thle temporamy land area to its minimuim and to shorteni tile occtipatiom
time and that the original ftuction of tihe land can be resumed in timle. No
random reclamation slhould hiappen.
(2) Eartirwork.and the stone fill shiould be well adjusted. Concentrated borrow
93



fill should be selected on the waste land and the borrow and deposit area silould
be covered promptly or planted with vegetation to avoid possible soil erosiou.
(3) Night operation (22:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. the next day) will be prolhibited it'
there is residential area within 150 meters adjacent the constru0ction site.
(4) Water spraying may be performed as necessary to the construictionl site and
the hauling access road.
(5) Adminiistratioii of the traffic shiould be strengtihenied and effective measures
sliould be taken to prevent the occurrenice of accidenits so as to avoid
(6) Greeninig of the road should be strengthiened whichi, in addition to bejiw,
able to reduce the noise and dust and to consolidate the slope and to beautifi y
the environmeht, can absorb part of the NOx and CO whicih has been eniitte(i
into the air so as to reduce the pollutioni. It is recommended that two rows of
trees be planted oni the road side of Liuctun Village with an east-west lengthi of I
kilometer whiich shall cost about 100,000 yuani.
(7) To the stanidard-exceeding situationi of the noise level at Liucun Village. -the
following measures should start to be taken in the middle stage of the set-vice
period: to assist the residents at the roadside in takinig partial noise-reduicillg
measures in the middle stage to change the windows of the hotuses into Iwvo
layers which shall cost about 50,000 yuani and in the far stage perfonr t(ie saine
refonnation to the hiouses in the second and the third rows which shall cost
about 100,000 yuan. At the same time the layout of the village shiould be
reasoniably adjusted so that the factories and shops may be located on the toad
side whiile the residential areas can be as far as possible away from the roa(l.
4.3. Environimenital Protection Measures and Recommendation for the Service
Period
(1) The planning units are recommended not to plan schools, hospitals atid
other environmentally sensitive wUits or buildings within 100 meters on the road
side anid no plan for new residential areas will be allowed to be located within
50 meters oni the road side.
(2) Traffic administration should be strengthened and any vehicles exceeding
the standard for tail gas emission and noise shiould be prevented from travelhiiw
on the road. At the same time maintenance of the road should be sitreigtilenied
alid the operation order shiould be maintained.
94



(3) Greenling of the road shiould be strengthienied so as to reduce the noise. (lust
and to consolidate the slopes and to beautify the enivironment. Trees should he
planted especially on the sensitive spots so as to purify the air, reduce tile
density of NO,  in the atmospihere and to confonn it with the atmosphere
quality standard. It is suggested to plant tow rows of trees, eacil 50() IlIcII-C!
long, along the road side niear TaiXi village,with total costs of 50,00ORN113
Yuan.
Consideriing the existence of many variable factors suchi as the possible ch;inge
of the predicted traffic amouLit and the road alignmient in the accident (iesi'ii
map, it is veiy necessaiy to strengtihen the environimenital monitorinig wvorl iII
the service peeriod so as to assure the prompt and appropriate executliol ol ,he
environimenital protection mieasures and to actually guarantee thie enivironincilil 
and living quality of the r-esidents along the r oute.
5. Evaluationi Conclutsioni
5. 1. Current Situation ofthie Enviroiimenit Quality
The ecotype of the area along the coninectling line is mainly agricultural ecolopy
and there is nio rare plant. The sounid environiment backgroLnd value anuId ille
atmosphiere enivironimilenit background valtue are relatively low and are- ill timlf
coniforimanice withi the evaluationi standard with large environmenital capacity
5.2. Conistructioni Period
The constructioni period is the period in which the environimenit suffers Il e
deepest affect by the whole highway project. Althiough the damage to tile
envirounmenlt is a shiort one, greatest efforts shiould be made to compensate {or it
In this period, special atteitioni should palticularly paid to the soil erosioll ;.nld
the promipt restorationi ol planiting so as to avoid dust emission an ii(i in t limIle
accidents.
5.3. Seivice Period
The enivii-oimenit shall stiffer certain affect by tihe large traffic amounlt oni ihis
route. However, sinice this road is reconstructed on the basis of the existing oldl
road, great efforts shotild be mnade to keep the enviroinmenit as closely v Xis
possible to the current situation witlh the increase of the traffic amoulit. ThC
expected chianges of thie nioise and atmosphiere environmenit shouildl be hesi
eliminated in the ecological metliod. Large scale plantinig and greeniniu canll IIo
only reduce the nioise and absorb the waste gas of the motor cars and tlie dtism
95



but also are beneficial to the enviroimnenit quality and beautificationi ol t(ie
whole area.
All in all, althougil the environimenit shall be slightly affected  b)I lHie
construction of this coniectling linle, the affects shall be able to be compelisite(I
througlh tile environmiental protectioni measures. Tlherefore, from tlle point loi'
view of tihe wilole, the advantage is larger thani the disadvantage xinid iiis

along the rouites. Detailed opilliolls were solicited from the constirictioni unitils
and environimenital protection agencies.
In April,1996 tihe affected people by the six interconnecting roads were req iIIred
for sampliig. It states from the inqUirlies wlich hlave been collected, ;ilImosi
every residenits along the rouites (including farmers, workers, carders. doclors.
