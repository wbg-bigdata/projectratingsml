SUMMARY ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
A. PROJECT BACKGROUND
1. Studies on Beijing-Shenzhen Highway-Shijiazhuang-Anyang Ex-
pressway Project (SAE) was initially started in early 1986. The Pre-feasi-
bility Study Report was finished in September, 1986 and the Feasibility
Study Peport was finished in Feburary, 1991. The preliminary design was
completed in December,1992.
-   2. In July, 1991, Hebei Provincial Communications Department
(HPCD) entrusted the Highway Scientific Research Institute (HSRT) of
Ministry of communications (MOC) to undertake the environmental impact
assessment work of this project. The Institute holds Class A Certificate for
undertaking environmental assessment issued by the National Environmen-
tal Protection Administration (NEPA). The Terms of Reference (TOR) of
the EIA was approved in June, 1992, and the EIA was approved by NEPA
in March, 1993. Apart from the EIA and SEIA, other reports like Resettle-
ment Action Plan (RAP), Environmental Action Plan(EAP), Environmen-
tal Training Program and Culturual Relics Investigation Report were also
prepared.
3. The EIA and EAP of SAE's interconnectiong roads have been re-
viewed three times by the Bank's specialists in June and October, 1996.
Comments from the Bank were reflected in the revised reports which were
submitted to the Bank before December, 1996. The principles and mitiga-
-1-



tion measures in the EIA and EAP for Shijiazhuang-Anyang expressway
are also applicable to the interconnecting roads.

Please refer to Annex VI for detailed envinnmental standards.
5. Scope and Period of Assessment:
The scope of atmospheric, ecological and noise assessment on the in-
terconnecting roads is within 200 metres on both sides of the roads' central
limes. The assessment scope of socioeconomic and living conditions is with-
in the whole administrative region (i, g, prefectures, cities, etc. ) through
which the road passes. The scope of assessment is adjustable depending on
actual conditions. Based on the project features and construction cycle, the
assessment year is set as the year 2017. The construction period is 1997-
1999. The near future operation year of operation is 2000, the medium fu-
ture year of operation is 2010 and the far future operation year is 2017.

C. BASIC ENVIRONMENT DESCRIPTION
7. Topography and Landforms
(1) Cixian Interchange-Linzhang County: It is located on the fan-
shaped alluvial plain at the foot of the mountains in Linzhang County. The
terrain is slightly declining from west to east, about 58- 95 metres above
sea level.
(2) Shahe Interchange-Nanhe County: It is located in the south plain
area of Hebei Province, slightly declining from west to east. The Taihang
Mountain is on the west. The terrain is flat.
(3) South Xingtai Interchange - Doucun village: It is located in the
south plain area of Hebei Province, flat with terrain and about 60-71 me-
tres above sea level.

(4) Neiqiu County-Beizhangma Village: Located north of Xingtai City
and east of Taihang Mountain, the landform is composed of tnountains,
hillyland and plain area.
(5) Baixiang (Gaoyi Interchange) - Ningjin County: It is located on
the alluvial plain east of the Taihang Mountain. The terrain is low and flat,
flightly declining from north - west to south - east, 25 - 35 metres above
sea level.
(6) North Shijiazhuang Interchange Interconnecting Road: It is located
in North China Plain in the middle of Hebei Province and east of shiji-
azhuang City. The terrain is flat and the landform is simple.
8. Climate and Hydrology
The SAE Interconnecting Roads Project is situated in the north tem-
perate zone with distinct four seasons. Winter is cold and snowy, spring is
dry and windy, summer is hot and rainy and autumn is cool and sunny. The
annual average temperature is 12. 7-13. 7'C ,and the annual average precip-
itation is 488-565mm. Rainfall is concentrated in summer, accounting for
75-80 of the annual whole. Winter is prevailed with nouth-west wind,
and the other seasons are mostly prevailed with south-east or south-west
wind. The wind speed is generally 2m/s.
Rivers in the project area are of shallow wide and seasonal type, usual-
ly without water. The rivers belong to the well deveoped Haihe River Sys-
tem. Underground water is abundant and good quality. It is the water
source for industrial production and agricultural irrigation. The rivers nor-
mally run from west to east, the same as the direction of the intercon-
necting roads. Therefore,no cross-over is necessary.

The SAE Interconnecting Roads Project falls in the counties of
Linzhang, Shahe, Nanhe, Neiqiu, Ningjin and the cities of Xingtai and Shi-
jiazhuang, belonging respectively to the Prefectures of Handan, Xingtai and
Shijiazhuang. The three cities of Shijiazhuang, Handan and Xingtai are the
economically developed areas in Hebei Province. The average economic in-
crease rates of the three cities are all above 15%.
Shijiazhuang Prefecture is well-developed in its industry and agricul-
ture. It is famous nation-wide as the production base of grain and cotton.
Wheat and corn are the major crops, and petrolum chemistry, electronics,
textile and pharmaceutics are the main industries.
Xingtai Prefecture witnessed quick development of industry in recent
years, with coal mining, textile. chemical engineering, construction mate-
rials and mechanical plants as the priority. Grain crops include wheat,
corn, millet, potatoes, etc. The plain area in the east is considered as the
base of grain and cotton.
Handan Prefecture is the important production base of grain and cotton
in Hebei Province. Cash crops include cotton and peanut. It is also abun-
dant with mineral resources and has become the iron and steel base of
Hebei.
The total project-affected area is about 9395 sq. km with a popullation
of 5. 87 million. The population density is 625 persons/sq. km. The living
and education levels of the popu Lation in the project area are higher than
the provincial average.

10. Ecological Environment
Since the project area has a long histooy of human activities and eco-
nomic development, The primeval vegetation has been damagedl and re-
placed by artificial vegetation. Weeds can sometimes be seen at the edge of
the field or along the river bank. The project corridors are the most impor-
tant agricultural area of Hebei Province, mostly with two harvests in a
year. The major crops are wheat, corn, millet, sorgum, beans, rice, etc.
Cash crops include cotton, peanuts, fiber crops, etc. Broadleaf deciduous
forests are sparsely scattered over the area. Most of them belong to wind-
break belt network. No rare species of animals or plants has been discov-
ered in this area.
11. Tourism and Cultural Relics
The project area has many tourist sites including the Baiyun Mountain
in Xingtai City, the Jiulong Temple in Shahe City, Laoye Mountain, etc No
major cultural relic sites has been found in the project corridors.

12. Atmospheric Quality
From statistics of atmospheric monitoring in recent years, the NOx
and CO contents of Shijiazhuang, Xingtai and Handan Cities are all up to
Class I standard of atmospheric quality, but the TSP pollution is relatively
severe.
Since the proposed interconnecting roads are far from cities, there is no
regular monitoring statistics. In May, 1996, monitoring activities were car-
ried out at representative sensitive spots along the interconnecting roads.
Results of the study show that the TSP, NOx and CO density are all up to
Class I standard of atmospheric quality. The areas on both sides of the
roads have good quality atmospheric environment. The environmental ca-
pacity is big, which provides good conditions for road construction activi-
ties.
13. Acoustic Quality
The above-said monitoring results also show that the project area has
good acoustic environment. Most of the areas along the roads are quiet
fields, the day and night noise values of which are both below relvant stan-
dards.
14. Types of Soil
The main types of soil along the project are clay, loess sub -clay,
clayey moist soil, sandy moist soil, loam, etc.
15. Transport and Communicatons
A Comprehoensive transport network has been initially formed in the
project-affected area, with railway and highway transportation as the main
stay, The highway sector accounted for 89. 9% of the total transportation
-8 -



volume in 1991. With rapid economic development in recent years, trans-
port volume also has great increase, causing heavy burden on the already
out-of-date road network. The construction of the interconnecting roads
will help SAE play its full economic radiation function, thus helping the de-
velopment of economy in the corridor.
D Projected Environmental Impact and Protection Measures
16. Based on the projection of environmental impact of SAE Intercon-
necting Roads Project, the assessment of the impact, the protection mea-
sures and the preparation of environmental action plan can be described and
implemented by three stages:
17. Design Stage
(1) Rational Selection of Alternatives. While taking rational aligin-
ment and economy into consideration, the design unit also considered seri-
ously about the occupation of cultivated land, schools, residential area, the
local development planning, the sources of construction material, etc. All
these factors will affect the environment in some way so they are considered
thoroughly to miniminze negative effects. The alignment is selected by
avoiding sensitive spots like residential area and schools and by utilizing ex-
isting roadls to reduce the amount of land acquisition and resettlement.
(2) Reduce land acquisition. The project is located in plain area, most-
ly making use of existing roads, thus greatly reducing the amount of land
occupation.
(3) Demolition and Resettlement. Thanks to the rational selection of
alignment alternatives, towns and villages are mostly avoided and the
amount of demolition and resettlement is minimized. Please refer to the fol-
lowing table for details.

The construction unit will set up land acquisition and demolition offices
at various levels. Detailed resettlement action Plan has also been Prepared.
Please refer to the PAP for details.
(4) Soil Erosion
Wide soil erosion shall not occure upon completion of the Intercon-
necting Roads since the works shall be constructed over North China Plain
where the terrain is flat and where there is less rainfall and the land is al-
most wholly covered with agricultural crops. What's more, subgrade of the
Interconnecting Roads shall not be so high.
(5) Communication Between Local People
Since the Interconnecting Roads shall be constructed as non -auto -
only highways whose accesses shall not be controlled, there shall be no ef-
fect on the communication between local people and their farm work, for
villages at both 'sides of the interconnecting roads could still be accessible to
each other.
(6) Noise Pollution
-10 -



Based on the site survey data and other engineering data about the In-
terconnecting Roads, there are 14 sensitive points within the 80. 299km as-
sessed. Since the villages included in the sensitive points are relatively far
away from the Roads and since the traffic volume shall be relatively less
based on the traffic forecast, noise levels at most of the sensitive points
during operation period shall be under the limits. Thus, there is no need to
apply noise reduction measures. Yet monitoring on some of the sensitive
points shall be carried out based on actual conditions so as to take proper
protection measures.
(7) Air Pollution
Based on the predictions, consistency of COy and NOx at all sensitive
points shall be well under the limit standand during the operation period. It
is planned by the State that during the Nineth - five - year Plan, compo-
nents of petrol shall be improved, the execution of which shall decrease the
containt of pollutants in the vehicle emissions and eventully decrease air
pollution of the operation period. Besides, the quarries, borrow pits, waste
areas, wastes disposal areas and mixing stations of lime and asphalt should
be located relatively far away from residential areas.
(8) Water Pollution
Engineering design defines that a complete permanent as well as tem-
porary drainage system shall be provided to reduce pollution to surface wa-
ter, irrigation system, and the existing drainage system.
(9) Preservation of Cultural Relics.
Based on the survey data, no cultural relics were found along the Inter-
connecting Roads.



(10) Flood Control
Design of the Interconnecting Roads has given full consideration that
adequate numbers of culverts and complete subgrade and pavement drainage
systems shall be provided to satisfy flood discharge. In addition, alignment
of the Roads is in parallel with the main river streams in the project area.
18. Construction Phase
(1) Air Pollution
Pollution to the air during the construction phase shall be mainly gen-
erated from lime soil mixing, transportation and operation of construction
equipment and machines which create flying dust. Apart from that, air can
also be polluted due to the mixing of asphalt concrete and the loading and
unloading of construction materials which could also create a little amount
of flying dust and asphalt smoke. To mitigate pollution to the air of the
construction site and to protect the workers for construction and the resi-
dents living nearby, following measures shall be taken: (a) Equipment for
mixing materials shall be equipped with dust removal facilities of Grade I .
Attention shall be called to those operators of mixing machines to labour
health care. Furthermore, mixing stations shall be located 200m away at
the leeward from sensitive villages. (b) Roads for construction shall be
spread with water, esp. the mixing stations and sites as well as the access-
es. Sealing devices shall be used for transportation of materials for con-
struction. (c) When filling subgrade, Contractors shall be asked to spread
water over the compacted filling material. They shall also be asked not to
store their materials uncovered. Storages should be at certain distance from
villages. (d) Topsoil at borrow pits shall properly be stored and laid back
for cultivation upon completion of borrowing.
(2) Noise Pollution
-12-



Noise pollution at construction phase shall be mainly generated from
construction machines and transportation vehicles. Following measures are
to be taken to protect workers for construction and nearby residents.
Operators of construction machines shall work on shifts to reduce time
period for them to be affected by heavy noise. Or work producing heavy
noise shall be arranged intersectively with that producing light noise. Apart
from that, labour protection measures shall also be applied and work time
shall be adequately shortened. Construction machines shall be properly
maintained and operated to keep the noise produced at the minimum level.
In addition, where there are villages 100m from the construction site, con-
struction shall not be allowed from 22: 00 to 6: 00 at night. Contractors
shall be asked to strengthen construction management so as to mitigate
noise pollution with reasonable construction behaviour. The access roads
are selected at the places 100 meters from the villages.
(3) Preservation of Ecological Resources
Borrow of earth shall not be allowed from forests or cultivated land.
When earth has to be borrowed from cultivated land, top soil (30cm) re-
moved shall have to be protected and filled back upon completion of con-
struction. Effect on ecological resources as well as agriculture shall be re-
duced to the minimum extent. Propaganda on preservation of natural re-
sources shall be carried out and strengthened.
(4) Soil Erosion and Water Pollution
Waste land, uncultivated land, and land with less vegetations shall
have the priority to be as borrow pits. Contractors shall keep the drainage
system smooth and shall enclose with earth or bricks the construction mate-
rials the storage of which shall be a certain distance away from water re-
sources to protect pollution from runoffs. Waste water produced by con-
struction activities shall not be allowed to be discharged to streams or rivers
-13 -



or irrigation channels unless it is processed in sediment chamber in advance.
Furthermore, waste matters shall not be allowed to be thrown into water.
(5) Construction Campsites
Since the interconnecting roads are constructed in pace with the ex-
pressway, construction campsites will not be set up separately. Relevant
regulations in EAP for the expressway shall be followed.
Septic tanks as well as garbage cans shall be provided and cleaned peri-
odically to keep the campsites clean and tidy. Waste water shall not be al-
lowed to be discharged into public water resources. Health check-up shall
be carried out periodically to ensure good health of the workers.
(6) Cultural Relics
Construction shall stop immediately whenever cultural relics are found
and relevant departments are informed to be on site for examination.
(7) Vehicle Management
Traffic management over the existing roads shall be streng thened and
management plan over vehicle transportation be worked out to reduce traf-
fic blocks.
(8) Accident Risks
Safety facilities shall be provided and traffic regulations shall be strictly
followed to minimize traffic accidents. Relevant measures in the EAP for
the expressway will be followed.
19. Operation Phase
- 14 -



(1) Vehicle Management
Vehicles shall be kept in good quality by strengthening maintenance
and management. Vehicles with their noise and tail emissions exceeding the
limit standard shall not be allowed to travel on the Interconnecting Roads.
Vehicles transporting materials should be covered.
(2) Emission Contral
Vehicles with their emissions exceeding the limit standard shall not be
allowed to travel on the Roads. Trees shall be planted along the road sec-
tions with more traffic and from which there are sensitive points nearby.
(3) Traffic Noise Control
Sensitive villages close to the Roads shall be monitored. Construction
of permanent sensitive buildings such as residential buildings, schools, and
hospitals are not allowed within 50m at both sides of the Roads.
(4) Leakage of Dangerous Goods
Relevant coordination agencies over transportation of dangerous goods
are to be set up and contingency plan and managent measures are to be pre-
pared.
E. ENVIRONMENTAL MORNITORING
20. Monitoring Plan
The Monitoring Plan is worked out for the purpose of reducing pollu-
tion and of rectifying the correctness of the predictions of enviromental im-
pact. It is also for the purpose of timely adjustment of environmental pro-
tection measures. Please refer to Annex I for details.
_ 15



21. Air Quality
Air quality shall be monitored at two phases, construction phase and
operation phase. At the construction phase, TSP and asphalt smoke shall
be monitored. Monitoring sites shall be those of construction sites, sensi-
tive residential areas and roads for transporting construction materials. At
the operation phase, XOx and CO shall be monitored for two times every
year with a duration five days each time. Five monitoring sites shall provid-
ed for each interconnecting road.
22. Noise
During construction phase, monitoring sites shall be mixing stations
close to which there are residential areas and construction sites once every
-which with a duration of one day (once both at day time and at night). Ran-
dom monitoring shall also be applied based on actual conditions. At the op-
eration phase, monitoring shall be carried out four times every four years.
There shall be five monitoring sites for each interconnecting roads.
F. MANAGEMENT ORGANIZATION STRUCTURE AND STAFF
TRAINING
23. Since the interconnecting roads are constructed simultaneously
with the Expressway, environmental management shall be the responsibili-
ty of the agencies which are also responsible for that of the Expressway.
Management of environment of the interconnecting roads at design phase
and construction phase is the responsibility of IFILPO while at the opera-
tion period, it will be the responsibility of the Highway Administration Bu-
reau of HPCD. The Environmental Administration Burean of Hebei
Province shall be responsible for the day - to - day monitoring. For the
monitoring of local environmental protection management work, local Envi-
ronmental Protection Administration Bureaus shall take the responsibility.
-16 -



Please refer to Annex 11 for details of environmental monitoring agencies
and details of monitoring plan.
24. Training plan of the Interconnecting Roads is associated with that
of the Expressway. Main items include (@) training of environmental man-
agement staff and (® training of environmental supervision staff. Please re-
fer to the Report on Training and Procurement for details.
G. PUBLIC PARTICIPATION
25. Survey on public opinions was carried out in the middle of March,
1996 by the department responsible for environmental impact assessment
together with the Employer and the design institute. Major activities of the
survey included interviews, questionaires, and other forms. Such survey
was for the purpose of protecting the interests of affected public. Results of
the survey showed that local people were all in favour of and eager to see
construction and improvement of such interconnecting roads so as to im-
prove their living standard and enhance local economic development. Mean-
while, they were also concerned with the environmental impacts and sug-
gested to strengthen roadside tree planting to reduce traffic noise and pollu-
tion to the air. Those affected by land acquisition wished that they would be
treated in accordance with the State regulations. Thus a resettlement action
plan was prepared. Please refer to the Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) for
details.
H. RESETTLEMENT
26. Sampling survey showed that one hundred percent of the people af-
fected by house demolition requested that they were to be compensated eco-
nomically based on the State regulations.
\;27. Based on the demands of the local people and in accordance with the
State policy, issues in which local people were interested shall be dealt with
properly to ensure that the living standard of those affected shall not be re-
-17 -



duced due to the construction of the Interconnecting Roads.
I. CONCLUSION
28. Negative environmental impact shall be mitigated with the execu-
tion of EAP and the environmental protection measures.
29. No cultural relics were found during survey. State regulations on
cultural relics shall be strictly followed so the there shall be no negative ef-
fect on cultural relics.
30. Transportation of dangerous goods shall not generate severe risks.
Impact on existing flood control facilities shall be less.
31. Demolition and resettlement shall not result in much removal of a-
gricultural people into towns and cities. Living standard of people shall not
be reduced.
32. There shall be no effect on resources of animals and plants. Con-
struction of the Roads is beneficial to the development of tourism.
33. Construction activities shall bring more environmental benefits
than environmental loss. What's more, the existing environment shall be
improved.
34. Special environmental protection agencies shall be established in
combination with those of the Expressway to be responsible for environ-
mental protection works.
35. An Environmental Action Plan is prepared which includes the envi-
ronmental mitigation action plan and environmental monitoring, and super-
vision plans.
