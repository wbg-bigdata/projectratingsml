Chapter 1 General
1.1 Origin of EIA Assignment
Starting from north at Beijing , capital city of.China , and
ending to south at Zhuhai , window of openning to ourside ,
National trunk road Beijing--Zhuhai passes through Beijing,
Hebei, Henan, Hubei , Guangdong provinces , which plays an
important role in north-to-south transportation in China .
It also one of "two south-to-north and two east-to-west"
trunk roads proposed by the Ministry of Communications to be
basically completed by the year of 2000 . By the end of 1997,
Beiing--Xinxiang  will  be  built  up  access-controled
expressway while Zhengzhou--Xuchang expressway was completed
for openning to the traffic in 1996 ; currently ,
Xuchang--Luhe expressway is under construction and expected
to be put into used around 1998 , also, some preparation for
initial stage are being done for Luhe--zhumadian section
which is expected to be completed around 2002 . At that time,
there would be only left Xinxiang--Zhengzhou section which
have to share one road of National 107 , of which is north
to Zhumadian on the Beijing--zhuhai national trunk road . In
the requirement of MOC's planning, both Beiing--Zhuhai
national trunk road and national highway 107 will parallely
exist which will undertake different transportation task.
Based upon this principle, the status of "sharing one road
"at Xinxiang--Zhengzhou section is only temporary solution .
Xinxiang--Zhengzhou is a class I highway and was completed
in December 1989 also is the first high-grad highway in Henan
which play a very active role in exchange communication
between both bank of the Yellow River and in improving
develpement of economy along the alingment . This section,
however, is mixed traffic due to adopting intersection with
the other road which produce a serious crossing interruption .
In addition, With the city's development , the said section
become street degree ,which restrict the benefit of highway
and can not meet the demand of fast growth of traffic volume
In order to ensure the said section to be smoothly driving
prior to completion of Xinxiang--Zhengzhou expressway and the
second Yellow River bridge , Henen Provincial Traffic Survey
& Planning Design Institute, through comprehensive analysis,
proposed to upgrade the highway section into expressway
standard ,and the total investment for upgrading works
amounts to RMB532.11 million yuan and it is proposed to take
use of the savings from the Bank loan under National Highway
Project Henan Section and of force account from Henan
itself ,in which the savings from the World Bank loan under
National Highway Project (Henan section) amount to US$19
million (RMB157.70 million) .
As required by relevant environmental management provisions
for construction project of the Government and Henan Province
3



as well as EIA provisions for World Bank-financed projects ,a
full-scale EIA is required to be completed for this
section, for Xinkxiang--Zhengzhou bel-ongs to project class A%.
As entrusted by Henan Provincial Highway Administration
Bureau-, Henan Provincial Environmental Protection Institute
is held responsible for EIA of this section road
1.2 Project Location, Size and Alignment
Henan province is located in the center part of China ,and
in the middle reaches of the Yellow River (see Map 1-1). The
existing class I highway zhenghou--Xinxiang section is
situated in the north part of the province, on the both bank
of the Yellow River (please see Map 1-2 for the project
location of this section).
According to the recommended scheme in the Feasibility study
Report of the project   ,the alignment of the proposed
upgrading works specifically is : starting from north at
connecting location between Anyang--Xinxiang expressway and
national 107 i.e Xinchang interchange ,and it passes through
west of Langgongmiao , west of Jinlou, Maotan in Yuanyang
county , east of Ciguti , Songlou, east of Xinzhang , then
going across the Yellow River ,east of Shaoyuan,east of
sangyuan , west of Shilipu , center part of Bai village and
Wang    village    ,   ending    at    Longhai    railway
station(K686+803.5) , with the total length of 69.773km .
In accordance with the alternative proposed by the Design
Institute , scale and technical standard to be adopted for
the upgrading works on XZH is as follows :
a : upgrading class I highway in length of 69.773km in which
39.326km is between Xinchang interchange and north bank of
Yellow River, 30.447km is between north bank of Yellow River
and Longhai railway interchange .
b. 39.326km long highway to the north of the Yellow River will
be upgraded into the fully-access controlled expressway
standard with provision of service road for local vehicle
access. The section to south of the Yellow River will upgraded
into class I highway with partially *Lccess controlled and
with motorized and non-motorized separated and overpass
bridge built for pedestrian .
c. the section to the north bank of YR will build 1 simple.
interchange, 24 separations, reconstruct 9 passageways,
43.5km for local road and 30km for service road and overpass
bridge. The section to the south of YR will newly build 9
pedestrian overpass bridges, 2 interchanges at two crossing
location and reconstruct 5 intersections.
d. to upgrade the section from Xinchang interchang to north
bridge bend cap of YR in length of 43.776km to class I highway,
rehabilitate 1 service area and toll station at Jinlou and
YR of south section

2.1 General description of the project
Before completion of Xingxiang Zhengzhou Expressway ,
Xinxiang--Zhengzhou upgrading work is a temporary work which
will initially relief the existing class I highway of serious
interrupting and also solve capacity fail to achieve the
original   design   level   of   the   class   I   highway
capacity .Alternatives of the upgrading works on XEH is
defined through comphrensive analysis by the Design
Institute . On the premise of two conditions , the first one
is that Jiaozuo Yellow River Bridge is completed and opened
to the traffic by 2001 ,and the second one is that
Xinxiang--Zhengzhou expressway and the second Yellow River
bridge is completed and opened to the traffic by 2004 .Being
completed the upgrading XZH , such section will maintain the
status of sharing one road between Jingshen national trunk
road and national highway 107 .
2.1.1 Current status of Xinxiang--Zhengzhou class I highway
To convient description , three sections will be divided
between Xinxiang and Zhengzhou highway ,which is north
section to the north bank of the Yellow River (Shanbiao--
Xinzhuang) , Zhengzhou Yellow River bridge, and south section
to the Yellow River bridge (south bank to Longhai
interchange)respectively . Present status of  such three
section of highway are described as follows :
2.1.1.1 North Section to the North Bank of the Yellow River
(Shanbiao--Xinzhuang)
In July 1986 Henan Provincial Planning & Economic Committee
(HPPEC) approved the preliminary design of vehicle
accommodation road on national highway 107 prepared by the
Design Institute with the documentation No.018 (1986), and the
length of the road is in 57.595km in total . Class I highway
at plain area with access-controled was adopted for the
origial design of which design driving speed is 120/h, width
of subgrad is 23.Om,   two way four-lane and median was
adopted .
After review of design in 1987,HPPEC approved the project with
the documentation No.1668 (1987)that class I highway without
access-controled was defined ,i.e common class I highway
would  be  built  between  north  of  Xingxiang--PuYang
intersection  and  north  bank  of  the  Yellow  River
(Xinzhuang)with total length of 47.05km , designed driving
speed 100km/h , width of subgrad 23.Om,centrer median 1.5m ,
two- way &four- lane , and with cement concrete being adpoted
for the pavement . In addition, the bearing capacity for the
bridge is : vehicle- super class 20, trailer--class 120

2*8.5m for the bridge width . There are 3 interchanges , 9
passageways,  2 sepa-ration iriterchanges with railway,  62
intersections used for large vehicle lane, 711.42/13
large,medium bridges, 241 culverts ; common class II highway
would be built between Shanbiao--Xinpu intersection with
length of 10.545km . The section of highway was commenced in
March , 1988 and built for opening to the traffic in December
1989
2.1.1.2 Zhengzhou Yellow River Bridge

and the rest of it is 2*1.Om
2.1.1.3 South section of the Yellow River (from south bank
to Longhai interchange )
The section of the alignment is in the length of 20.477m and
was built in 1989. The alignment for this section is situated
in territory of Zhengzhou city and also near downtown area ,
with interconnecting between Liulin of north rural area of
Zhengzhou and major trunk road on Huoregose
This section   was designed and constructed as Class I
highway ,with design driving speed lOOkm/h,pavement width
25.Om, two-way & four lane, and cement concrete being adopted
for the pavement . The designed bridge loading capacity is :
vehicle--super class 20, trailer--class 120. There were built
40 intersections (in which 13 of them connecting with highway,
2 of them with the railway , 25 of them with the large vehicle
lane ), 756.44m/13 large, medium bridges, and 88 culverts.

2.1.2.3 Brief Description of alternative scheme
The alternative scheme raised in the FSR of the project share
the same section with the recommended scheme , of which is
from the starting point of the proposed project to Liulin
interchange in zhengzhou . The only different section for both
of the scheme is that the alternative scheme goes eastward
starting from Liulin interchange along the existing
Zhengzhou-Kaifeng expressway in length of 15.8km to Yanzhang
(interchange to be built)and then goes southward where will
built a new expressway in length of 26.2km connecting with
the existing Zhengzhou-xunchang expressway .Therefore,
comparison between recommended and alternative scheme is
comparison both the section for upgrading existing N107 to
the south of YRB and the section of newly built expressway .
The newly built expressway in length of 26.2km in the
alternative scheme consist of two sections with different
technical standard . Two-way six-lane expressway standard ,
8. Okm in length, will be adopted at the section from Yanzhuang
to planned urban trunk road Zhengzhou-Zhongmu , while the
section southward will build two-way four-lane expressway in
length of 18.2km . The table 2-4 shows the major technical
indicators for the newly built expressway
The alternative scheme of the newly built expressway have the
following work magnitude : the total length is in 26.2km for
the newly built expressway with asphalt concrete paved . The
subgrade for the whole alignment will adopt borrowed earth
and the average height of the subgrade is 4.05m ; newly built
2 large bridges, 2 middle bridges, 3 interchanges, 1 grade

The cost estimate for the alternative scheme of newly built
expressway amounts to RMB 521.6233 million yuan
Through comparison analysis to both schemes, it is assumed
that recommended scheme in the feasibility Study Report is
reasonable (please see the Chapter 5 for comparison of the
alternative in detail). Hence, analysis- of environmental
impact factors and environmental impact assessment will only
focus on the recommended scheme
2.1.3 Origin and Transportation of Construction Material
Stone and sand : The norhtwest part of area where Xinxiang
--Zhengzhou highway is located belongs to frontier part of
Taihang Moutain which is rich in stone resources and quarries
has been formed . Stone material required for the upgrading
work will be purchased from the region of  Luwangfen in
Xinxiang, Xinmi in Zhengzhou, Qi county, Weihui, Anyang etc.
Such stone material will be hauled by vehicle to the
construction site along NTH 107. Sand required for
construction work will be supplied by quarry of Suiping
Shizhuang , and will be hauled firstly by railway
tranSporLation to Xinxiang , Zhengzhou station then to the
construction site by vehicles.
Soil : The most of construction work on north section of YR
are works with higher embankment height over NTH 107 , which
will require a large quantity of soil material . As the section
of highway is located in flat area without sufficient soil
source to be used , soil material will be borrowed from
assembly identified location along both side of subgrade
Four major material : most of them will be purchased from
Xinxiang and Zhengzhou ,and insufficient part of them will
be obtained from outside in other city. Cement will be from
Xinxiang, Zhengzhou; asphalt product will be used from
Shandong and Luoyang oil refinery factory ; Steel material
will be supplied from Tianjing, Anyang steel plant; timber
will be purchased from Xinxiang and Zhengzhou . Above major
four material will be hauled to the construction site by
vehicles along NTH 107
2.1.4 Prediction Results of Traffic Volume
Beside of the factor social economic development, we still
consider the following two factor which will influence the
traffic volume : the former is upon openning of Jiaozho YRB
in 2001, the vehicles driving toward south will be diverted
so that the traffic volume on YRB and south section of YR will
be decreaed, while
12



there  will  be  no  change  on, north  section  of  YR;. cthe
latter.  is   due   to   openning  -f  -Xinxiang--Zhengzhou
Expressway and the second YRB in 2004, most of pass-by
vehicles and part of internal vehicles will divert to the
Expressway so that the traffic volume of the proposed
project at that time will significantly decrease and
later it will be getting grown year by year
Prediction results of traffic volume in the Feasibility
Study Report are as shown in-the Table 2--4 .

2.1.5         Arrangement   of   Construction   Period   and
Implementation Schedule
The proposed project is the World Bank -financed project
thus savings of bank loan will be financed. The proposed
project   expected  to  commence   construction   work  by
December 1998, and completion of work is by the end of
September 2000 , with 23 months of construction period
The detailed schedule is as follows :
year 1997    completion of design and fund raising
year 1998    bidding, land acquisition & resettlement, preparation
of construction will be completed by early part of this
year while work will be commenced by December .
year 2000    All  contractors  put  into  all  their  efforts  for
construction activity , and the project will be opened
to public by the end of September.
2.2   Identification of Project Environmental Impact
Based on feature of the project, important part of the
upgrading work is located on north of YR of which include
such construction work i.e pavement upgrading, newly
built service road, interchanges, passageways etc.; while
on south section of YR, only separating facilities and
signal system and over-pass pedestrians as well shall be
installed in construction period . Towarding this end,
environmental impact of the project construction is
mainly on north section of YR. The environmental impact
element are as shown as in the Table 2--5 .
Table   2--5          Environmental   Impact   Element   for
construction period of the Project

we can see from above table that environmental impact element
is very few on YRB and south of YR of the upgrading project,
and also no local resident people would be impacted around
YRB in construction period , Due to distribution of many
business facilities on south section of YR at where very few
resident are living , affected people due to construction
noise is very few either. Because of such reason, the EIA
Report will focus on analysis of environmental impact on north
section of YR  in construction period
Environmental impact element on north section of YR is
basically as same as the element on south section , which is
componsed of the following :
noise and vibrtio due to vehicles;
exhaust of vehicles;
land area for permanent use at service road and interchanges;
blown dust due to vehicles;
road pavement erosion due to rainfall water;
traffic accident;
social interruption upon completion of upgrading work;
Identified results of environmental impact of the upgrading
project is summarized in Table 2--6

The proposed project is a project of upgrading the existing
highway ,and basically upgradin4 works_,at the-south section
of Yellow River will not produce unfavorable impact on
eco-environment ; on the north section.of_YRB, except that
the area near interchange have some earthwork , the. other area
have little earthwork, so the proposed project will not
seriously damage the ground ,and nor will damage soil loss ;
upgrading to YRB will not influence eco-environment ,so it
is not main environmental issue for the proposed project
Based upon above analysis, it is clearly defined in line -with
environmental feature in the area of the project as follow :
the main environmental element is environmental noise, air,
social environment;
Environmental impact will mainly be focused on the north
section of the YRB during construction phase

Chapter 3 local -hysical 2   rnironmet -and Socioeconomic
Background
3.1   Physical Environment Description
3.1.1.1 Topography and Geomorphology
The proposed project is located in the middle-north part of
Henan province and lies on both bank of the Yellow River .
North section to the YR (starting from the terminal point of
AnXin expressway on NTH Beijing--Zhouhai ending at north bank
of the YR) is situated to western side of Huabei plain and
east of Jingguang railway. This area is in flat and wide with
an elevation of 70-85m , and the trend of this area is high
in the southwest and low in the northeast . As the Yelllow
River change its course many times in centuries , there still
have some ancient river courses, river bank as well as river
floodland along the route . This area located in Haihe valley
South section of YR (starting from north bank of YR ending
at Longhai railway interchange ) situated in Huaihe valley and
belongs to alluvial plain of Yellow River in line with
different catologue of Geomorphology type . The Yellow River
has ever overflown its banks and changed its course many
times , both of which was happened in this area frequently
and could reflect the geomorphology feature of the Yellow
River diversion . so there distribute in this area many
different geomorphology of highland, depresstion land,
floodland etc..
3.1.1.2 Climatology
The area along the alignment falls within the warm semi-arid
climate zone with distinct four seasons . The climate is mild,
with dry and windy springs, hot and rainy summer. In the
autumn, there is a sharp difference of temperature between
day and night hours; in winter, it is cold with little rain
and snow .
Based on the meteorological data provided by Xinxiang and
Zhengzhou city, the mean annual tempreture of this area is
14.0-14.3°C , with a max. monthly average tempreture of
27.6--27.7°C in July and min. of minus 2°C in January; annual
mean air pressure is around 1003hPa , relatively annual
moisture is 60%-70% with annual mean rainfall of 606--637mm.
In a year, the frost-free period lasts 205--217 days.
Along the route, deflected northeast wind prevails in
Xinxiang with annual average wind speed of 2.5m/s , while
deflected southeast or south wind prevails in Zhengzhou with
annual average wind speed of 2.2m/s.
3.1.1.3 Engineering Geology and Earthquake Intensity
16



Based on engineering geological area in Henan province, the
ar a where the project goes through, belongs th 'stabilized
unaverage engineering of the Yellow River alluvial whose
southern end lies on the alignment of Changge, Zhoukou,
Shenqiu county . The project area is in the front of Taihang
mountain with an elevation of 40--lOOm . The property of soil
in this area is divided into light-cohesive soil, cohesive
clay together with fine sand, silt sand . In addition, salty
soil can be found in north & east of Henan. Except for cohesive
soil which is high in mechanics strengthen , the other kind
of soil is low in mechanics strengthen .-
The main geological problem in the project area is the earth' s
crust is not in average of stabilization . There develope
active fault movement from east-northward to west-eastward ,
thus this kind of movement-shaped the dangerous earthquake
region including Xinxiang--Anyang, Jiyuan--Jiaozuo,
Xuchang--Yeling and Fanxian county etc.. Learning from some
relevant information ,the project area is in 7 degree area
of  basic earthquake intensity
3.1.1.4 Hydrogeology
The project area lies in the second settlement belt of
Xinhuaxia system . The settlement degree is very deep since
new ecological era with top ground layer in new ecological
era of 1500--3000m . The soil in the project area, due to on
the Yellow River alluvial ,is changed so much in the way of
longitudinal and crossing with different thickness of
settlement . Sand soil, silt clay and cohesive soil are
alternately settled in the layer of settlement . The midium
& low liquid limit cohesive soil with yellow and red colour
can be found within the range of 0.5--l.Om under the surface
ground along the route while fine sand, silt sand as well as
midium sized sand can be found under 6.Om of the surface
ground .
The project area is located in the irrigated area of the Yellow
River with irrigated channel being distributed in
longitudinal and crossing manner .The underground water of
the project area is very close to the surface ground , which
normally is 1.10--3.40m with the nearest distance to the
surface ground of 0.4m and the farthest distance of 6.7m
As the reasult of season and of irrigating crops in farm land,
the level of underground is high in summer & autumn and is
low in spring & winter ,which is around lm of different change
in four seasons . Input of the underground water is
significantly affected by the Yellow River and then by
rainfall and irrigated water .
3.1.2 Socioeconomic Background

During construction of class I highway over the past time
relocation was done at the village where is near both side
of highway , hence, there are few village located within 200m
off both side of the proposed highway .It is indicated from
above table that sensitive points on both side of XZ highway
are villages where is at least 150m away from highway
With rapid economic development in Zhengzhou, the south
section of the Yellow River bridge are getting close Zhengzhou
downtown area where very few village ,but much more business
commercial building are located on both side of highway , and
such large business buildings is as follows : Zhengzhou
Building Material Universal center ,Zhengzhou Furniture
Market, and Zhengzhou Automobile City etc.. Beside of such
building, there still distribute restaurants, small guest
house etc. on both side of the proposed highway .
There have no special environmental sensitive area such as
hospital, school, recovering house etc. .on both side of the
existing highway .
Through investigation, there have no distribution of precious
plant or animal within lkm along the route, nor have special
protected area such as westland and natural protection area
Through investigation, there have no distribution of cultural
relics or historical remains within 1 km along the route, nor
have underground cultural relics .
3.2 Present Status for Environmental Noise
3.2.1 Monitoring of Environmental Noise
Through investigation, there have no large distribution of
industry noise source within 200m off both side of the
existing XZH and noise source in this range is mainly of noise
due to motorized vehicles on the existing XZH . so
environmental noise of the EIA is focus on the existing XZH
of national highway 107
3.2.1.1 Arrangement of Monitoring Points
There set up 4 monitoring points along the XZH for the
environmental noise of EIA , with 2 points of each for both
the north to YRB and south to YRB , i.e :nearby Xinchang
interchange at starting point of the upgrading work, Jinlou,
Huayuankou township and Bai village. The basic situation for
such four monitoring points are shown in the Table 3--4 .

3.2.2  Evaluation of Noise Environmental Quality Situation
3.2.2.1 Evaluation Criteria
According   to   the   recommendation   from   Provincial
Environmental Protection Bureau and suggestion from
Protection Bureau at the city or county level along the route ,
"Environmental Noise Standard for Urban Area (GB3096-93)"is
applied for acoustic environmental setting evaluation of
these monitoring points, i:e . 7OdB(A)in day hours and
55dB(A)in night hours.
3.2.2.2 Evaluation on the present situation
It is shown in the monitoring result with reference to
evaluation standard that out of the four monitoring point
of acoustic environmental along XZH , the monitoring results
of environmental noise Leq for continious 2 days at daytime
& nightime near Xinchang interchange area are beyond the
evaluation standard limit, of which daytime Level equivalent
of the max. noise exceeded by 6dB(A) while nightime exceeded
by 11-19dB(A), also average value of Leq noise for 2 days
exceeded by 4dB(A)  and 17.6dB(A)respectively above the
standard ; At Jinlou point, monitoring result for neither
daytime Leq noise for continuously 2 days nor average value
for 2 days at daytime are above the standard limit, but noise
Leq value of one day at the nightime is beyond the standard,
and average value for nightime of 2 days exceeded by 3.8dB (A);
23



At. Huayua,nkou township point, one day of daytime value is.
beyond-the standard while monitoring result at nightime for
2 days all-exceeded the standard. The average value for both
daytime and nightime for 2 days at this point is above 73dB (A),
both of which are beyond standard (the value at daytime -is
over 3.8dB (A) while value of nightime over 18.2dB (A)); At
Baizhuang point, monitoring result either daytime & nightime
for 2 days or average value of 2 days are all beyond the limit,
of which the average value at daytime is over 5.3dB(A) ,while
average value of nightime is overl4.8dB(A).
From the monitoring result, we can see that environmental
noise situation at daytime & nightime for the four monitoring
point is big in standard dimension. In line with environmental
feature and noise source in the area along the route ,it is
deemed that transportation noise on the existing XZH
apparently impact acoustic environment at the four monitoring
point.
It is indicated from above analysis that suffering from impact
on XZH ,the monitoring points along the route is worse in
acoustic environment except that the Jinlou monitoring point
is slightly better . Based upon the average value of noise
Leq for 2 days , except that Jinlou point can meet the
standard , the remaining monitoring points were over the
limitation standard to different extent especially serious
at night of which the highest value above the limitation up
to 18.2dB (A) for average value for noise Leq . It is indicated
acoustic environment quality within 200m off the XZH can not
reach the catologue area "4" in "Environmental Noise Standard
for Urban Areas (GB3096-93)" .
3.3 Evaluation of Air Environmental Quality Situation
3.3.1 Investigation of Air Pollution Situation
In the study area, there does not exist large-scale industrial
air pollutant sourcees within 200m off on both side of XZH .
The major pollutant sources in this area is exhaust of
motorized vehicle and dust due to vehicle on this section of
the existing highway .
3.3.1.1 Arrangement of Monitoring Point
The monitoring point for air environment is as same as that
for acoustic environment and please see table 3--4 for the
background of the monitoring point in detail
3.3.1.2 Monitoring Item, and Analyzing Methodology
Air situation monitoring items include T.S.P., CO and NOx. The
detailed sampling and analyzing methodology of these 3 items

Based upon recommendation from Provincial Environmental
Protection Bureau and suggestion from the Environmental
Protection Bureau at city or county level , Grade II of the
State standard in "Environmental Air Quality Standard
(GB3095--1996)"issued by P.R.China will be adopted in the
EIA . The standard limitation is listed in the Table3--10.

NOx                  0.15                0.10
3.3.2.2 Evaluation on the present situation
It is shown in the monitoring results with referenc to
evaluation standard that :
Daily concentration of TSP at the two monitoring point nearby
Xinchang interchange and Jinlou is below the evaluation
standard of which the max. value is 0.267mg/M3 ,accounting for
89% of the EIA standard; the daily mean concentration of TSP
for the two monitoring point at the south section of YRB is
above the standard except that one day value(measured at
Huayuankou township)is below the standard , and the over-
limited percent is 90% ,in addtion, the max. value for daily
mean concentration of TSP is 0.865mg/m3 ,which is 1.9 times
of the standard (measured at Baizhuang point).
From the statistics on monitoring results, 1 hour mean
concentration and daily mean concentration of CO along the
road is all below the EIA standard of which the max. value
for 1 hour mean concentration is 4.059mg/m3 accounting for
40.6% of EIA standard (measured at Baizhuang point on the
south section of YRB); and the max. value for daily mean
concentration up to 2.358mg/3 which accounts for 59% of the
EIA Standard (also measured at Baizhuang point).
26



1 hour mean -concentration and daily mean concentration of NO,
along the road is all belowthe EIA standard of which the max.
value for 1 hour mean concentration of NOx is 0.113mg/rM3
accounting for 75.3% of EIA standard , and the max. value for
daily mean concentration of NO, up to 0.087mg/3 accounting for
87% of the EIA Standard ,both of which is measured at
Huayuankou township
As above analysis,air environment at north section of the YRB
can meet the Grade II in.."Environment Air Quality Standard
(GB3095--1996)" , and TSP is the main pollutant in air
enviromen of this area based upon the proportion of pollutant
in EIA ; however, air environment at south section of the YRB
is not capable of meeting above standard ,for daily mean
concentration of TSP is significantly above the standard;
concentration of CO,NOX along the road is not high which is
below the standard . Generally speaking, air environment at
north section of YRB is better than south section of YRB .
3.4 Lead content in the layer of farming land at adjacent
area of both side of the highway
Through investigation, cohesive soil and sand soil is leading
in the soil type along the alignment ,and some salty soil is
distributed Yuanyang county on the north section of Yellow
River .
In mid December 1997, Lead content in the layer of farming
land at adjacent area of both side of the highway lead content
was monitored . There are totally four soil sampling point
which was arranged in the farmland near monitoring point for
environmental air and noise , and please see background of
each monitoring point in table 3--4 for detail
During lead content monitoring in the layer of farmland, soil
sample (0--20cm) was collected in the layer of farmland .
Sampling method of " collection of scattered five point " was
adopted for each sampling spot ,and lkg of soil sample would
be stored after average mixing ,and then it will be used for
analizing after such soil sample being dried, creshed,
screened
The tools without lead was used for sampling collection and
pre-treatment .
The methodology of atomic absorption photometer was adopted
for measurement of lead content sample . The meausred result
is shown in the Table 3--11
Table3--11    Measued results for lead content in the layer
of the farmland soil along the route

Grade  II  in  "Soil  Environmental  Quality   Standard
(GB15618--1995)" was selected for EIA Standard of lead
content . PH value for farmland soil is between 6.5-7.5 and
the standard limitation for lead content is 300mg/kg
As above monitoring result and suggests of EIA standard, Lead
content in the layer of farming land at adjacent area on both
side of the highway is all far below the EIA Standard with
the max. value 21.56mg/kg (measured at Jinlou) accounting for
7.2% of EIA Standard
It is indicated that lead content in the layer of farming land
along the route is very low and that soil of farming land
along the route is not apparently polluted also, lead content
is still within the range of lead content with natural soil
background (it is stipulated that lead content for natural
soil background is no more than 25mg/kg).
3.5 Present Situation of Water Quality at Guanxin section
of the Yellow River
Profile for water quality monitoring was set up near
Hluayuankou at Guanxin river section of the Yellow River
where collects complete monitoring information for water
quality . The EIA appraise the present situation of water
quality at the Yellow River by selecting monitoring
information of the said profile in 1997
Annually 12 times monitoring was done in total at
Huayuankou profile of the Yellow River , which is once
every month or 4 times in the river period of dry,
average, and peak season . The river period was divided
into the following: dry period is in March, April, May
and June of every year; average period is in November,
December , January , and February ; peak season period
is in July, August, September, October . According to the
division of ground water function in Henan, the standard
of water quality in Zhengzhou section of the YR is of the
III criteria stated in "Environmental Quality Standard
of ground water" (GB3838--88), and the EIA will assess
the present water quality by comparing the monitoring
results for water quality as this standard

mercury, chromium, lead, cadmium was not tested, and
neither did cyanide .The density limit value for SS is
not listed in GB3838-88
As stated in above table , four item of permanganate
index, BOD5 ,non-anion ammonia, petroleum at Huayuankou
profile exceed the standard in which over-limit percent
for permanganate and non-anion ammonia up to 100% . The
other item are under standard limit . General metal
content at this profile is low in average and most of
heavy metal index was not tested out .
It is indicate from above analysis that water quality at
Huayuankou profile of the YR can not reach III category
standard of the ground water and water quality was
slightly organic polluted

4.1 Environmental Impact Analysis at Construction Stage
4. 1.1 Acoustic Environmental Impact Analysis at Construction
Stage
Methodology of investigation with comparison analysis was
adopted for acoustic environmental impact at construction
stage on the project
The proposed porject is upgrading project to the existing
highway ,of which, north section of YRB at construction stage
involve construction of subgrade, bridges & culverts,
interchange , pavement rehabilitation etc.and the YRB involve
only  construction  of    separating  facilities  on  the
bridge ,beside of above, south section of YRB consist of
access-controling to the existing highway, building of
pedestrian overpass, signal system at intersection road etc..
On the basis of construction activity among these section of
highway , noise impact at the north section of YRB is slightly
serious while noise impact at the section on the YRB and south
section of YRB is relatively light .
Construction equipment or machine to be used for the upgrading
work on the north section of YRB is composed of loader, grader,
roller,bulldozer, excavator,paver, generator unit, pecussion
drill, batching plant etc.. noise source intensity of such
construction equipment or machine are included in Table 4--i.
Table4--1 Noise Source Intensity of Construction Machinery

Batching Plant                 79
Beside of above machinery, there still have noise source
intensity from pile machine, and vehicle used for hauling
building material .
29-2



Relatively few- construction machinery would, be used for
construction on YRiBand the south section of YRB . Beside of
batching plant used for construction of overpass pedestrian-,
there still have metal cutting tool and electric welding
machine. etc., all -of which is not high in noise source
intensity.
Noise in -the construction stage is evaluated in compliance
with the "Noise Standard for Boundary of Construction
Site"(GB12523--90). The standard values are as included in
Table 5--3

During year 1995, Henan Provincial Environmental Monitoring
Center Station did monitoring field work for ZLE and AXE under
construction and such monitoring information is used for
analysis to the proposed project at construction stage in the
EIA.
The major construction activity on the north section of YRB
is very similar with construction of pavement,bridges &
culverts and guard rail work etc. according to comparison
analysis result ; while construction activity on the YRB and
on the south section of YRB is similar with decoration of guard
rail at post-construction stage of expressway according to
comparison analysis result . Consequently, the proposed
project could learn some experience from site monitoring
result of environment noise on the expressway at construction
stage . Please see table 4--3 for monitoring result with
comparision analysis of expressway at construction stage for
detail .
From the Table 3--4 , we can see that Leq environmental noise
at daytime near boundary of construction site in the course
of constructing subgrade, bridge on AXE is 71--73dB(A) in
the max. value , which is no higher than noise limit value

Standard for Boundary of Construction Site"(GB12523--90) at
construction of "earth & stone work"; the general range of
environmental noise at daytime for the two boundary of
construction site is 59--73dB(A) , which is significantly
higher than noise Leq of daytime on cooresponding point where
is far from the construction site . The range of noise Leq
at nightime at construction site boundary is 45--53dB (A) of
which is no big change while comparing with nightime value
44--48dB(A)on   the   corresponding   point  ,which  means
construction noise would apparently impact acoustic
environment during construction of subgrade and bridge &
culvert ,while basicly no impact would be made at night due
to suspension of construction work
During monitoring with comparison and analysis being done
small quantity of pavement work with leading construction of
slope  protection  work,  guard  rial etc.    on  ZLE  were
proceeding , and at that time Leq environmental noise at
daytime on the boundary of construction site was no more than
65dB(A) that can meet the EIA Standard; however,Leq
environmental noise at some part of section were above the
standard ,partly for construction work had to be additionally
accelerated for completion early so that construction
activity were still done at night . The Leq environment noise
at night have big difference comparing with the corresponding
point 500m away to the construction site ,which means
construction activity at night have some impact on acoustic
environment beyond boundary of construction site .
Furthermore, based upon the monitoring result on the
high-grade highway from other provinces at construction
stage, impact range of construction noise is: no more than
200m (at daytime)off on the boundary of construction site
while 300m is limited at nightime . At the construction of
subgrade and bridge stage on AXE & ZLE, Leq environment noise
at daytime on the two corresponding point where is 200m, 500m
away to construction point is very little different , which
also means impact range of construction noise at daytime would
not exceed by 200m .

As above comparison monitoring result, it is stated that noise
impact at initial construction stage (subgrade , bridges &
culverts)are slightly higher than that at secondary
construction   (pavement,   decoratoin  work  etc.);   the
construlction noise would apparently impact on the environment
if construction activity is done at night especially noise
intensity source from piling machine
As for the upgrading work on XZH, scope of noise impact on
the north section of YRB is no beyond 200m off the boundary
of construction site ,it would be no impact on the noise
environment in case of suspension of construction at
night ,while noise may reach 300m off the boundary of
construcion site in case of construction at night .
No resident people will be affected during upgrading the YRB ,
so noise impact is not the key environmental issue for this
section of upgrading project
Construction on the south section of the YRB will mainly at
daytime and the scope of noise impact is the limit of 200m
off the boundary of construction site . There distribute a
32



great deal of: business housings on both side of existing
highway on the south section of YRB ,which could restrict
noise of spreading. There would be less noise impact on the
highway section with business house on both side
The- villages along the existing-highway is over 150m away from
the highway so that no serious noise impact on the villages
along the roadway . While construction of the proposed
project, the existing XZH will still keep operation .also,
it is stated in the monitoring result available that
construction noise is lower than the vehicle noise at the
operation . It is deemed that noise impact on the villages
along the route will source from vehicle noise on the highway
in the course of upgrading construction on XZH . Accordingly,
acoustic environment quality at sensitive point will keep the
same level as usual during construction of the highway
4.1.2 Air Environment Impact Analysis at Construction Stage
Same as EIA of acoustic environment impact, comparison
investigation method was adopted for air eviroment at
construction stage and comparison information was selected
from the monitoring result on ZLE and AXE of which most of
these information is in 1995 .
It is shown in the Table 4--4 for selected monitoring results
of air environment on the boundary of construction site .
In the comparison information of table 4--4 , AXE is at the
initial construction stage on subgrade and bridges & culverts
while ZLE is at the secondary construction stage on decoration
of guard rail .

As  stated  in  the  comparison  information  ,at  initial
construction of subgrade and bridge (monitoring information
at construction stage on AXE, 1995), daily mean concentration
of TSP on leeward of construction site at the selected three
contract sections is significantly higher than the
corresponding point and daily mean concentration of TSP are
all above the EIA Standard with which the max. value is beyond
by 1. 6 times of the standard . while daily mean concentration
of TSP at corresponding point is only 30% above the standard
with which the max. value is above the standard by 0.6 times .
At secondary construction stage of decoration (monitoring
information at construction stage on ZLE,1995), daily mean
concentration of TSP on the leeward of construction site is
also higher than that in corresponding point ,but both of
which is lower than that at initial construction stage from
the scope of the monitoring result .
It can be clearly indicated from above analysis that blown
dust due to construction would unfavorably impact to a certain
extent the air environment at leeward of construction site.
Impact at initial construction stage is more serious than
secondary construction stage
In addition, as the monitoring information from Beijing and
Zhejiang ,asphalt smoking dust at the area within leeward of
lOOm under the asphalt concrete mixing plant exist phenomenon
of over-limit and also the concentration of asphalt smoking
releasing from the concrete asphalt mixing plant can reach
to the Grade II in the "Comprhensive Release Standard for
Atmosphere Pollutant "(GBI6297--1996).
It is stated in the comparison monitoring information result
that various kind of construcion blown dust would unfavarobly
impact the air environment at the construction stage and the
main scope of impact is in the area where is within leeward
of 200m on the boundary of construction site especially
serious impact in the area within leeward of lOOm (mainly
impact to the construction workers ). Blown dust at initial
stage is more serious than secondary stage at construction
stage
As for the upgrading works on XZH, there have some
construction work on subgrade and bridges on the north section
of the YRB and the measure of lime soil & asphalt concrete
assembly mixing would be taken for this section so that the
area within leeward of 200m on the boundary of the
34



construction- site woul-d-be unfavarobly affectedby blown dust
due to construction.
The upgrading work on YRB and the south section of the YRB
is mainly of  construction on access-controling work and
barrior installation so that only produce little blown dust
and would not affect air environment , .
4.1.3    Analysis  on  the  other  Environment  Impact  at
Construction Stage
The proposed project is an upgrading work to the existing
highway and it is not easy to obtain soil used for subgrade
and interchanges on the north section of the YRB. The required
soil need to borrow from the farmland along the
alignment ,which will unfavarobly impact on the eco-
environmental agriculture ; Temparary land use is needed for
the proposed project , which will unfavarobly impact on
agriculture production  As a whole, only small quantity of
earthwork and short period of construction is required for
the proposed project so that it will not much damage the
eco-environment and such damage could be recovered to a great
extent .
Before building the XZ class I highway ,excavation and survey
work along the alignment was done by the Archaeology
Department to enable the cultural relics along the route being
-well protected , therefore, basically the upgrading work
would not impact on the cultural relics .
On the north section of the YRB , ground water flown might
be affected due to bridge construction . An appropriate
measures during construction period need to be taken to
relief this impact and such recommended measures is give in
the Chapter 5 of the EIA report
During upgrading work on XZH, construction work will
influence the existing transportation each other . In order
to avoid long time traffic jam, all contractors are requested
to arrange reasonable constructoin time , and construction
activity dispatching so as to minimized the impact between
construction activity and the existing transportation .
During construction on the proposed project, landscape along
the route will be temporarily changed but it will be recovered
or improved after completion of the construction activity .
As a whole, not so much work need to be done on the upgrading
project of XZH'and the period of construction only lasts 18
months , so various unfavorable impact on the environment at
the construction stage are all lighter than that for newly
built highway . After various measures for environmental
protection being taken, unfavorable impact on the environment
35



would be minimized to the lowest degree at the construction
stage
4.1.3  Environmental Impact Analysis by the two interchange
at south of the YR at construction phase
Two interchanges will be built to the south of the YR on this
section, namely at the intercrossing of Jinshui road (belongs
to urban road of Zhengzhou)and Zhengbian road (Zhengzhou to
Kaifeng highway)with the existing road N107 . Zhengzhou
municipal city will responsible for construction of these two
interchange , thus it is not in the scope of the proposed
project
Currently commercial housing are located around the two
interchanges, so noise sensitive point is very few . Business
activity are mostly concentrated in the daytime, there are
basically no business activity at night, therefore, nuise
impact due to  construction  of the  two  interchange  is
acceptable in the construction phase .
In the construction phase for the two interchanges
construction dust would be produced at earthwork stage of the
initial construction , but approach road and ramp of the two
interchanges all belong to viaduct which require less
quantity of soil, thus there would not produce so much
construction dust . therefore, construction dust will be very
little at the secondary construction stage . In the event that
the asphalt mixing plant is installed at proper location where
far from residential area and business area, it would avoid
impact to the construction site from asphalt mixing dust .
In the construction phase of the two interchanges, the
existing traffic impact by construction activity is the major
influence   Due to big traffic volume on this section, it is
very often to see congestion ,and traffic jam before
construction of the two interchange, and construction
activity       make        this       situation        further
serious    .consequently   ,communication   administration
department in Zhengzhou city work out traffic management
program mainly with vehicle distribution in order to make the
impact of the existing traffic due to construction to the
lowest degree

4.2  Environmental Impact Assessment at Operation stage
4.2.1 Acoustic .Environmental Impact Assessment at operation
stage
4.2.1.1 Assessment Criteria
After completion of upgrading work on XZH, the standard of
Grade 4 area stipulated in "Environmental Noise Standard at
Rural Area"(GB3096--93)will still be followed for the noise
EIA Standard wihin 200m on both side of highway , and the
standard limit value is : 70dB (A) for daytime while 55dB (A) for
nightime.
4.2.1.2 Selection of Prediction Model    --
After completion of the upgrading project, noise intensity
source is of traffic noise from various type of vehicle
driving on the highway .With the principle of "combination
point and alignment together with leading of the point " ,
traffic noise at the sensive point listed in the Chapter 3
in the EIA will be predicted . American FHWA model is used
to predict equivalent traffic noise level .
With a large traffic flow in daytime, vehicles driving on the
road can be regarded as infinite and discontinuous noise
sources . The model is expressed as follows
Leqi=Laimax+ 11g (Qi/ViT) +lOlg (r,/r) l+a+AS-13
As the traffic flow at night is small, vehicle driving on the
road can be deemed as discontinuous point noise sources . The
model is expressed as follows :
Leqi=Laimax+ lOlg(Qi/ViT)+201g (r,/r) + lOlg (ro/r)a + AS-13
Then, the equivalent traffic noise level at a given point of
the roadside is
n
Leq =10lg(1  10o.1*Leqi )-AL
I=1
in which
Leq= equivalent traffic noise level of "i"type vehicle dB(A)
Leq= equivalent traffic noise level, dB(A)
Laimax= average reference eergy level,  dB(A),  of "i"type
vehicles
Qi = traffic flow of "i"type vehicle (km/h)
T= sampling time, 1 hour (h)
r0= distance for observing L,±mx (m)
r= distance from observation point to effective land (m)

4.2.1.3 Revision of Prediction Model
a. Defination of average vehicle driving speed
Being upgraded on the section , the driving vehicle speed is
caculated : 120km/h for the north section of the YRB while
100km/h for the south section of YRB . The EIA will follow
the average vehicle speed on the whole corridor of this
section as follows :
large vehicle : 60km/h
Middle vehicle : 75km/h
small vehicle : 90km/h
b. Average Reference Laj..
This parometer relates to the average speed of vehicles. The
relationship is as follows
small vehicle    L..= 77.2+0.18v
L,u,= 62.6+0.32v
L..= 59.3+0.23v
and the the results was caculated as follows
large vehicle : 88dB(A)
middle vehicle : 86.6dB(A)
small vehicle : 80dB(A)
d. Distance from Prediction Point to Effective Lane
Such distance is caculated as follows
r= DN . DF
In which
DN = distance from prediction to nearer lane
Df = distance from prediction point to farther lance;
d. Caculation of Traffic Volume
In the Feasibility Study Report (FSR) of the project, traffic
volume in the future of different year was predicted with
converted into the medium truck equivalent . According to the
results of OD in the FSR and proportion of different vehicle
type, traffic volume was caculated into specified number
based on different vehicle type and hour traffic volume was
caculated . since nobody would be affected on the Yellow River
Bridge, it was not taken into account during caculation . The
table 4--7 indicate the results of caculation

e. Identification of Acoustic-absorbed coefficient Relating
to the Ground Coverings
The coverings on north section of YR are mainly agriculture
crops while on south section of YR, except for business
buildings ,the remaining on both side of roadway are
agriculture crops too  . accordingly , acoustic-absorbed
coefficient assumed 0.5
f. Defination of Revision AS
Revision AS for traffic noise model is composed of several
items, which is longitudinal slope of the road , road pavement
and road structure etc. .
The following formular will be followed for Revision AS due
to longitudinal slope of the road in which j is road slope
():
large vehicle : 981
middle vehicle : 73p
small vehicle : 50p
After completion of the upgrading project, asphalt concrete
pavement are still paved on the north section of the YRB with
little pavement roughness and "0" will be used for caculation
of revision due to road pavement . On the south section of
the YRB, cement concrete will be casted in place with much
38



pavement roughness and "+2dB(A)" will be used for revision
due to road-pavement
After upgrading work is completed on the section of this
corridor, except for the north section of the YRB where higher
subgrade is located at interchages, the remaining section is
of lower subgrade thus area of acoustic impact is very small .
As the village along the route is 150m off the both side of
highway on the proposed project thus the monitoring due to
pavement structure (acoustic impact area) will not be taken
into account during prediction
4.2.1.4 Results for Prediction
In accordance with the former prediction model, parameter and
revision , The two components is predicted i.e level
equivalent traffic noise within scope of 200m along the
route ,and Leq traffic noise for the key sensitive point along
the route .
On both side of highway of the south section, due to much more
commercial housing which could restrict spreading of traffic
noise , the prediction results on its south section is only
for reference .
Nobody would be affected by the traffic noise on the YRB , so
it is no need to prepare impact prediction
Table 4--8 shows prediction results of traffic noise within
scope of 200m on both side of highway while Table 4--9 is for
prediction results of traffic noise at key sensitive point
4.2.1.5 Analysis for Prediction Results
a. Analysis of traffic noise in the area within 200m along
the route
As shown in the Table 4--8 prediction results comparing with
EIA Standard , at initial operation phase (2000), on north
section of the YRB the standard 7OdB(A) was limited in the
area of 160m off the roadside . when the traffic volume is
at average in daytime hour, 7OdB(A) was measured in the area
of lOOm--1Orm ,and 55dB(A) was monitored in the area of
llOm--120m at night; while on the south section of YRB, the
standard limit of 7OdB(A) was beyond the area of 200m at the
traffic volume in peak day hour, but it was measured about
140m from the roadway at the average traffic volume of
daytime. in addition, standard limit 55dB(A) was in the area
of 100-120m of the roadside.
After 2004 , with completion of the second YRB and Jiaozuo
YRB , the traffic volume on the north sectoin of the Zhengzhou
YRB of the proposed project will be much less than before and
then will be increasingly gettig grow with the development
39



of economy and socilist till the middle operation stage when
the traffic volume. will still be less than that at initial
operation stage , hence traffic noise impact at this stage
will be physically lighter than the initial operation stage
On the north section of the YRB, at the traffic volume in
daytime peak hours, the standard of 7OdB(A) was monitored
in the area of 140m off the roadside while 55dB(A) at night
is between 140m--150m off the roadside ; On the south section
of YRB, at the traffic volume in daytime peak hours , the
standard of 7OdB(A) is monitored in the scope of 160m off the
roadside , at   average traffic volume of daytime standard
limit 7OdB(A) is in-the range of 100m off the roadside ,and
at nightime of average traffic volume 55dB(A) is between
100--120m .
Till long-term of operation stage , with the further growth
of the traffic volume , traffic noise will then increasingly
serious impact the environment on both side of highway of
which will beyond the initial operation stage . On north
section of the YRB, at the traffic volume of daytime peak hours
the standard of 7OdB(A) will beyond 180m , also at average
traffic volume of daytime it is up to 120m ,the standard of
55dB (A) at night is about 120m off the roadside; while On the
south section of the YRB, at the traffic volume of daytime
peak hours the standard of 7OdB(A) will beyond 200m , also
at average traffic volume of daytime 70dB (A) is up to 120m ,the
standard of 55dB(A) at night is between 120m--140m off the
roadside.
As a whole, after completion of the proposed project , traffic
noise impact will be increasingly serious prior to 2004 and
will be declined to the lowest degree till 2004 then will be
increased with the year going .The level of traffic noise at
initial operation stage will be reached till 2014 on the north
section while on the south secion , it will still below the
level at initial stage even even in long-term operation stage
of EIA
Due to the differenc of the traffic volume , impact scope and
degree of traffic noise on both north and south section of
the YRB will be different to certain extent with more traffic
noise impact on the south secti-on than the north section of
the YRB.
Due to restricting the traffic noise by the commericial
housing on the south section of YRB, impact scope of traffic
noise on this section is far from reaching the scope of the
prediction result ,unfortunately , the traffic noise will
seriously impact the area within 40m on both side of
highway .As shown in the predicted results, Level eqivalent
traffic noise within 40m on both side of the highway will
probably beyond 8OdB(A) in each assessment year

b. Analysis for Traffic Noise Impact at the Sensitive'Point
As shown in the-Table 4--9  aias the sensitive point along the
route is far from the highway , at both initial(2000) and
long-term  (2010)operation stage after completion of the
upgrading work , the value at the traffic volume of daytime
peak hours will above the standard . At the initial operation
stage , with traffic volume of daytime peak hours , level
eqivalent traffic noise at Jinlou sensive point on the north
section was the only point above the standard but the
over-limit value is not much ,say 1.30dB (A); On south section
of the YRB, eqivalent traffic noise level   at the four
sensitive point are all above the EIA standard but their
over-limit value is not high of which the highest value is
at Yaozhai ( which is 71.37dB A with 1.37dB A being above the
standard). At the long-term operatoin stage, with the traffic
volume of daytime peak hours, the traffic noise at Gujun,
Maotan, and Wangcun can meet the standard but it is very close
the EIA Standard (69.06dB A-69.72dB A), and eqivalent traffic
noise level at the other sensitive point along the route are
all above the EIA standard with the highest value at Yaozhai
(which is 72dB A with 2.00dB A above the limit) it is higher
than the level at the initial operation stage .
At average traffic volume  at daytime and nightime, both of
them are not beyond the EIA Standard regarding eqivalent
traffic noise level.
Level eqivalent environment noise will above the EIA Standard
after predicted value of traffic volume at the sensitive point
plus the present value of environment noise , i.e, after
completion of the upgrading work, acoustic environment
quality at the sensitive spot along the route will remain the
same as usual , which fail to obtain the grade "4" in
"Environment Noise Standard at Rural Area" (GB3096--93). The
reason that the results of total value of such two component
being over the standard is caused by the higher present value
of environment noise equivalent level at such sensitive spot

In accordance with five-year meterological data statistic for
Zhengzhou and xinxiang , air stability over the past five
years is mainly divided into 2 categories, namely , neutral
and stable . and Table 4--12 shows freqency of air stability
over the past five years of two cities .

From- above table we can see total frequency of neutral and
stability in the aforesaid cities along the road is all above
80% while that of unstable is less than 20% , this can be
indicated that it is not good condition along this road for
air diffusion

Assumptions for predicting -air environmental impacts by the
project  include  prevailing  wind  and  secondary  wind
directions, neutral and stable stability with higher.
frequencies, annual average wind speed and prediction
distance (200 m leeward).prediction results will be
compliance with "Techinical Methodology for Standard of Local
air Pollutant Diffution "(GB/T13201--91) and "Preface of
Environmental Impact Assessment" (HJ/T2.2--93),and it was
also caculated into average concentratoin per hour for
pollutant based on time dilution parameter .

f. Prediction Results
Table 4--14 shows prediction results for 1 hour ave. pollutant
concentration at.the sensitive point along the alignment
4.2.2.4   Analysis and Assessement for Prediction Results
we can see the prediction results comparing with EIA
standard :
In the initial operation stage( Y2000) after completion of
upgrading works, CO, NOx ave: concentration of air (1 hour)at
the sensitive point of alignment are all below the standard
limit ,The max. CO ave. 1 hour concentration is 1.540mg/3 ,
accounting for 15.4% of the EIA Standard which measured at
Yaozhai on the south section of YR; also we can see from the
prediction results , CO concentration of air at the sensitive
point of the north of YR are not above 0.9mg/m 3 while CO
concentration at south of YR are all above 1.3mg/mr3 .The
highest value of No, concentration  (ave. of 1 hour)also
measured at Yaozhai on the south section of YR , which is
0.124mg/mr3 accounting for 82.7% of the EIA Standard limit
proportion. Though the highest value is below the standard
limit , but it very close to the EIA Standard . No,
concentration on north section of YR are all below 0.069mg/m3
while No, concentration on south section of YR are all above
0.11Omg/m3 .
In the middle operation stage(Y2010), CO, No. concentration
of air (1 hour average value)at all sensitive point of the
alignment are all below the EIA Standard limit and are
48



obviously Iower than that in the initial operation stage ,of
which deduction percent is about 20%--40% .For thd whole
alignment , the highest value of CO concentration of air (1
hour average value) is 0.915mg/m3 , accounting for 9.2% of the
EIA Standard limit proportion, while Nox concentration of air'
is 0.076mg/m3 , accounting for 51% of the EIA Standard ltmit
proportion , such two highest concentration value are all
measured at Yaozhai on the south of YR. From the general
prediction results, we can see CO, Nox concentration of air
(1 hour average value)at sensitive point on south of YR is
higher than that on north of YR .
During the late operation stage, CO, No, concentration at
sensitive point is apparently higher comparing with that in
middle operation stage, and are all higher than that in the
initial operation stage, but CO, Nox concentration of average
1 hour value is still below the EIA Standard limit , the highest
value of concentation is still at Yaozhai on south of YR .
The highest value for CO is 1.675mg/rM3 ,accounting for 16.8%
of the EIA Standard limit while the highest value of No. is
up to 0.136mg/m3 ,accounting for 90.7% of the standard limit
It is indicated from aforesaid analysis that in the base year
after completion of Upgrading works of XZH , CO,NOX
concentration of air (1 hour ave. value) for all sensitive
along both side of highway due to motorized vehicle exhaust
will not over the EIA Standard limit . In line with average
wind speed for years , prevailing wind direction in one year ,
neutral and with stability with higher frequencies , CO, No,
average concentration at sensitive point on south of YR will
higher than that on the north of YR.
After value of prediction concentration for above each
sensitive   point   plus   actually   monitored   average
concentration  ,  the  final  conclusion  for  CO  ave.
concentration are not beyond the EIA standard limit but the
total value of No, concentration are above the EIA Standard
limit to the different extent . Based on prediction result
at the different time period ,over-limit No, concentration is
mainly at high traffic volume of daytime peak hours ,and in
other of many cases, the total value of No, would not above
the standard limit

4.2.3   Environmental Impact in Operation Stage
4.2.3.1   Impact on Permenent Land Acquisition
The proposed project is an upgrading work ,hence the area for
newly land use is very few , only 1258.4 mu with deduction
of 100mu for borrow soil . The permenent land acquisition for
the project is only 1158.4 mu . Though such acquisited land
is farmland, but it would not obviously influence agriculture
production and eco-envioment along the alignment due to only
few land acquisition.
4.2.3.2   Prediction of Lead Content of Soil
Lead contained in vehicle exhaust originates from lead ethide
applied to the fuel to avoid explosoin. A big part of the lead
accompanying .the exhaust gas drops in the adjacent soil from
the road sides while small part of it suspends in air and
drifts farther.
The lead inflow to the soil in the vicinity of the road will
partly down to the crops and will move out of the soil with
cutting of crops ; while large part of lead will accumulate
in the cultivable layer . With PH over 6.5 , soil lead does
not vertically move to a large extent . With the development
of highway traffic volume, soil lead would accumulate
Accumulation of lead in the cultivable layer along both side
of highway is predicted as follows :
annual lead diffusion of unit vehicle
F= 365.a.b.l.p/G
G= 0.2m*100m*1000m*l2t/m3= 24000t
in which :
F= annual lead discharge of unit vehicle
a=average fuel consumption, assuming a=0.231/km
b=average lead content of fuel, assuming b=0.2g/l
i=lead ratio of exhaust pipe, assuming i=75%
p=lead deposition ratio at leeward, assuming p=60%
G=soil weight of cultivable layer at leeward,
annual input of soil lead : R=F.L (L is traffic volume)
when dischargeed from exhaust gas, the lead partly drops on
crop leaves and drifts away and partly penetrates in the
nearby soil at a ratio assumed to be 85%
The total accumulation of lead W= K(B+R)
in which,
W=lead accumulated in soil
K=residual ratio of lead in soil
B=background value of lead in cultivable layer of soil
R=average annual lead inflow to soil
51



Lead accumulation in n year is as follows:
Wn= Kn{Kn-i[...K2(B+R1)+R2+. .+Rn-l]+Rn}
K1=K2=K..--=K
Wn= BKn+KnR,+K1 L2+ ..+RnK
n
Wn= Bkn + KE (RiKn-1)
I-1
On the south section of YR , there are lots of commercial
housing distributed on both side of highway which can restrict
spreading of vehicle exhaust , it is no big sense to predicte
accumulation of lead content . On the north section of YR,
prediction'results for lead content in the farm layer is shown
in the Table 4--15 .
It is seen from the prediction results that lead accumulation
content would be varied with different traffic volume on north
section of YR. From 2000 to 2003, accumulation of lead content
will go up with the year going , while there is no big change
for accumulation of lead content from 2004 to 2007. After
2008 , soil lead content again will go up till 2019 it could
reach 40.737mg/kg on the north section of YR which is
eqivalent to one time of present status and almost to one time
of the value at the initial operation stage (2000). But in
this case, on the north section of YR the lead content in soil
is far below the Grade II standard limit 300mg/kg in "Soil
Environmental Quality Standard" (GB15618--1995), at that time
the lead content in soil only accounts for 13.6% of the
standard limit

4.3    Analysis of  Social Impact of Upgrading work
4.3.1 Impact due to land acquisition and resettlement as well
as land leasing
The upgrading project Xinxiang to Zhengzhou section on the
N107 goes through two counties, one district, seven
prefecture( township ) within jurisdiction of Xinxiang and
Zhengzhou city, in which two townships and one prefecture are
under Xinxiang county , three prefecture are under Yuanyang
county of Xinxiang city; one prefecture are under Jinshui
district of Zhengzhou city
Upgrading work is 69.773km in total and permanent  land
acquisition is 1877.64 mu (125.176 ha.) in which 1814.68 (121
ha.) mu is for wheat land ; vegetable land 7.66 mu (0.51 ha.);
fruit garden 5.71 mu (0.38 ha.); fishing pond 6.84 mu ( 0.46
ha. ); housing land 0.44 mu ( 0.03 ha. ); land for business
land acquisition for the two interchange to the south of
53



YR ) 42.31 mu ( 2.82 ha. ). Temporally land use in the
construction require 1255 mu (.83.67 ha. ) .
All house building (non-housing)to be relocated due to land
acquisition of this project up to 22918 sq.m, in which
illegally buildings up to 22020 sq.m accounting for 96% of
the total building relocation
Due to permanent land use, the major ground attachment to
be relocated (cut off) are listed below
Well      7 pieces
Tomb      13
Timber tree            5763 number
Electrical grids        47 location
Telecomm. Grids          9 location
There are totally 1250 land contractor due to permanent land
use , who will obtain the land they have through land
distribution .
The ground attachment to be relocated due to permanent land
use, such as housing, well, trees etc. will compensate one
time in accordance with "Compensation Standard for ground
attachment of Henan Provincial National Land Acquisition "
in the documentation of YuZheng (1989) No. 113 issued by the
People's Government of Henan Province and in accordance with
"Notice on compensation of the ground attachment for land
acquisition of national construction in Henan Province" in
the documentation of YuZhen (1993) No.152 issued by the
People's Government of Henan , as well as according to the
relevant notice (regulation ) by Xinxiang and Zhengzhou city.
There are no need to resettle residential people due to work
quantity of relocation of housing of this project, so no
impact in this regard would be exist
On the whole alignment of this project, permanent land use
is less than 2000 mu, trees to be cut off is less than 6000,
thus ecological environment along the route will not be
apparently changed .
4.3.2 Analysis of the other aspect of social environmental
impact
Impact on the cultural relics : Many work of survey,
investigation and excavation on the cultural relics of
alignment was finished prior to construction of class I
Zhengzhou--Xinxiang highway and cultural relics was properly
protected . The proposed project is very few of earth work
of which is within the scope of last excavation on the cultural
relics , therefore, the upgrading work will not impact
cultural relics along the route.
54



The villages along "the rout'e is far from the proposed the
project and it is very few quantity of relocation and
resettlment work almost no residential relocation ,
therefore, relocation work basically will not impact the
environment
Impact on Guanxin section of the YR : Upgrading work on the
YRB is only adoptation of separating measures , which will
not directly influence water quality in Yellow River.
Impact on landscape along the route :After completion of
upgrading works, landscape along the route will remain as same
as usual
Impact on social economic development : After completion of
upgrading works, driving condition will be improved on the
section of Zhengzhou--Xinxiang by increasing vehicle driving
speed, traffic saftey , and reducing traffic accident so that
it could promote local social economy along the route .
Social separation due to upgrading work : On the north section
of YR, there will construct one simple interchange, 24 grade
separation , reconstruct 9 passageways and will establish
continuous service road on the left side and discontinuous
service road on the right side ; On the south of YR, beside
reservation of the existing "t-' shaped intersection and "T"
shaped intersections , there will additionally build 9
pedestrian overpass bridge, 2 interchanges ,which will enable
social isolation minimized to the lowest degree after
upgrading work being completed.

Chap ter 5 Analysis of Altemative Alignment Scheme
5.1 Brief Description for Alternative Scheme
As for the alternative scheme proposed in the Feasibility Study Report, the
section where starts from starting point to Liulin interchang in Zhengzhou
south to the Yellow River bridge, is as same as with recommended
alignment . The alternative alignment will continue eastward from- Liulin
interchange using the existing Zhengzhou to Luoyang Expressway _ in
length of 15.8 Km , goes southward near Yanzhuang village (interchange to
be built) to newly built an expressway in length of 26.2km connecting with
the existing Zhengzhou to Xuchang expressway . consequently,
comparative between the recommended and alternative alignment is
actually to compare upgrading project N107 south to Yellow River Bridge
with newly built expressway .
The 26.2km expressway to be newly built in the alternative scheme will be
composed of two sections with adopting different technical standard . Two
way six lane expressway in length of 8.0 km will be built from Yanzhuang
to planned urban trunk road Zhengzhou to Zhongmu with east to west
direction, . and the standard with two way four lane will be adopted for the
remaining 18.2 km southward expressway.
5.1.1 The major technical index for newly built expressway of alternative
alignment
The scale for the newly built expressway are as follows below: total length is
26.2km with adopting asphalt concrete pavement, filling work is the mainly
work for the subgrade work along the whole alignment with elevation of 4.05m;
there will newly build 2 big bridges, 2 middle bridge and 3 interchanges, one
separation overpass Longhai railway and N310 , 4 separations with other
highway, 38 passageways, 75 culverts , in addition, management and safety
facility will be built . The total investment for the alternative alignment
expressway amount to RMB 52.16233 million yuan .
The major technical index for alternative alignment are shown in the table 5--

5.1.2 Alignment of the project
The alternative scheme overlay with the recommended scheme
at the section from starting point to Liulin interchange of
south of YRB , from which it goes eastward along KZE in length
of 15.Bkm to Yanzhuang (interchange to be newly built ), and
then goes southward crossing with the planned highway
Zhengzhou-Zhongmu near Kangzhuang ( interchange to be newly
built)again southward crossing with NHT310 at east of Putian
township (grade separation to be newly built), goes southward
again passing east of Dasunzhuang, XireXi crossing with the
existing Zhengzhou-Xuchang expressway (K19+000 of ZXE) near
Hezhang village of Menzhuang township , which is the terminal
point of the alternative scheme. The newly built expressway
between Yan zhuang and HeZhang village is totally 26.6km
5.2   Status of the Environment for the alternative scheme
The area where the alternative scheme goes through is rural
area with flat topography and belong to the Yellow River
alluvial plain ,with the major crops of wheat and rice . and
also water flood is not obvious . Basically no big industrial
pollutant located within lkm of the alternative scheme
In order to master the status of environmental quality along
the alternative alignment, environmental air, acoustic, lead
content in the cultivated layer of soil was monitored for this
EIA report in early May, 1998. The monitoring element for each
environmental factor are as same as that for the recommended
scheme . Environmental air, acoustic was continuously
monitored 5 day and 1 day respectively, and monitoring period
are set as same as that for recommended scheme . Lead content
was monitored once . The monitoring point for the alternative
alignment was set up near Kaizhuang interchange to be built,
the statistic results of monitoring are shown as follows
bellow
56-2.

It is indicated from above three table that area where the
alternative alignment goes through are of good quality in
environment . The environmental air in this area , except for
two days average density being above the standard (over-limit
percent is 40%),were far below the EIA Standard ; Acoustic
environment in this area are good which can reach class "I"
in "Environmental noise standard in Urban area" (GB3096--
93), this imply it is quiet in this area; the lead content
are far below the EIA Standard , only accounting for 4.2%of
the standard
With comparison the monitoring results for all environmental
element between Kangzhuang and Baizhuang to the south of YRB
(please see chapter 3 of this report), every pollutant
indicator near Kangzhuang are all below than that at
Baizhuang, which means environmental quality near Kangzhuang
are better than Baizhuang
It is shown from above analysis that environmental quality
at alternative alignment are better than recommended
alignment .

are superior to the alternative alignment in the respect of
mileage, construction scale, cost estimate, land acquisition
etc. . In the case of the present status from Liulin to the
terminal point, even if alternative alignment adopted, this
section as zhengzhou ring, road badly need to be improved so
as to solve the situation of crossing interruption, mixed
traffic and frequent traffic accident , otherwise, Zhengzhou
municipal government will not raise big fund to newly built
2 interchanges; after this section being upgraded, the
existing NHl07 Xinxiang-Z.hengzhou section will still remain
two-in-one system with national trunk highway Beijing-
Zhouhai in the short term period. As shown in forecast of
traffic volume, this upgraded section will meet the demand
in highway capacity, after Xinxiang-Zhengzhou expressway
being built in far future, this section as Zhengzhou urban
road still can create benefit . The alternative alignment of
newly built expressway is implementation of the section in
advance at south of YRB for Xinxiang-Zhengzhou expressway ,
while before expressway north to YRB and the second YRB being
built, the said expressway is difficult to fully create
benefit , which can be conclude it is a potential investment
waste. With shortage of fund at present, the recommended
alignment in the FSR is reasonable in a engineering manner.
Environmentally, the environmental quality in the area of
recommended alignment is no good , but it only remain the same

have the same environmental impact, only to a less degree
As seen from predicted results of this EIA report, in tha_
operation stage, acoustic enviroinment, air will be adversiy-
affected by the highway,. but it is still acceptable . In the
event of building an new expressway (alternative alignment),
original good environmental quality in the area of newly built
expressway will be adversely affected, and eco-environmental
change due to new expressway also need time to recovery . This
EIA report think it is acceptable to minimize every adverse
impact on environment provided that highway capacity can be
obtained in the short term period, so the recommended
alignment is reasonable.
Through comprehensive analysis, This EIA report agree the
recommended alignment put forward in the FSR.

1. Enhanced managmement of vehicles to ensure they are in good
condition;
2. Strengthened training services for drivers to forbid any
driving in drunkness and fatigue, and to forbid any forcible
overtakig, any driving in drunkness shall be seriously

carrying toxic, harmful, flammable, explosive and volatile
among any other dangerous things should have permissions
issued  by  public   security,   fire   and   communictions
departments;
4. The proposed section of highway is a bottle-neck section
on YR without alternative roadway being used , hence, in case
of windy, snowy, foggy and freezing days, vehicles should be
driven at limited speed, and traffic police shall patrol on
the road to solve the problem in a timly manner ;
5. In case of any explosion and fire, fire department should
be promptly informed and before dealing with the accident,
traffic police shall conduct traffic congestion and the

speed;
6. In case of any traffic pollution event, emergency remedies
should be.provided as required, and responsible environmental
agencies at different levels should be immediately informed
such that corresponding measures can be taken as appropriate;

Chapoter 7 Brief Economic Analysis
7.1  Econpnic .Evluation for the Upgrading works XZH
7.1.1  Economic Cost
Economic cost for upgrading works on XZH is composed of the
following aspects
7.1.1.1   Construction Investment
In accordance with "Economic Evaluation Methodology and
Parameter for Construction Project", labor, major building
material, land etc. in the evaluation of construction cost
shall be adjusted as shadow price :
a. Labor cost : coifficient of 1 was used for shadow income
caculation ;
b. shadow price adjustment of major building material : shadow
price of input five major material of the project i.e timber,
saw timber, steel, cement, asphalt etc. was adjusted and the
results for adjustement is shown in the Table 7--1
Table 7--1   Shadow Price for the Major Material
Description          unit _shadow price (yuan)
Timber               mJ                   1056.50
saw timber           m                    1258.85
steel                t                    3503.41
cement _                                  283.60
lasphalt            it                   11848.25
c. Shadow price adjustment of land : it includs two component
of land opportunity cost and consumption of new additional
resources. Land opportunity cost shall not be adjusted due
to little land acquisition of the project; consumption for
new addtional resources of the project means compensation for
resettlement and relocation in their evaluation , which will
not be adjusted based upon the experience of other similar
project
7.1.1.2   Cost of Maintenance and Management
Maintenance cost of the proposed upgrading project for each
kilometer is RMB15,000 more than that of the existing highway
for each kilometer based upon other similar project
7.1.1.3   Overhaul Cost
The overhaul is arranged to take place in the 10th and 18th
year upon completion of the project . The cost for such is
of 13 times of additional maintenance cost
7.1.1.4   Residual Value
Residual value at the end of evaluation term for the project
assumed to be 50% of construction cost

7.1.2   Caculation of Economic Cost
Upon completion of the upgrading project, it will
significantly enhance the driving condition on the corridor
of National highway 107 XZH section by raising vehicle driving
speed, saftety, and comfortability, and promoting social and
economy development as well as bringing enormous convenient
to the local people's life .The EIA report will determine
direct economic benefit of the project from the following four
aspects : benefit of shorter milage, of saved time of
passenger in tour, of saved cargo transportation time, and
of reduced traffic accident .
7.1.2.1   Benefit of Shorter Milage
It is benefit from the reduced transportation cost for
passenger and cargo due to completion of highway cosntruction
project .
7.1.2.2   Benefit of Saved Cargo Transportation Time
The saved cargo transportation time benefits from speeding
up  capital  turnover  due  to  higher  speed  of  cargo
transportation, such benefit cost will be caculated by
deduction interest of the required cargo transportation
capital
7.1.2.3   Benefit of Saved time of Passenger in Tour
The value could be created by shorter time of passenger tour
and thus National Income could be increased accordingly . Its
cost can be made by average proportion for each person of
Natinal Income
7.1.2.4   Benefit of Reduced Traffic Accident
Economic loss resulting from traffic accident could be
reduced upon completion of the upgrading work

Economic Benefit!xesults of the project wast-as shown as in.
the Table 7--3..
7.1.3   Economic Evaluation
Basic evaluation indices was worked out through comparison
between economic cost and benefit of the-project . (please
see table 7--4 in detail).
Economic Internal Return Rate : EIRR=15.27%
Economic Net Present Value :.ENPV=RMB Y95.4409 million
Economic Benefit Cost Ratio : EBCR= 1.214
Economic Investment Recovery Term : N=17 year
As shown from above -reference description, all evaluation
indiceesof the project are higher than basic value, which
means the project will produce good economic benefit
As sensibility analysis suggest,  the project is of good
risk-resistance

Chapter 8 Puib1ic3?Paiti'cipati-on  -< '>
8.1   Public Consultation
The scheme of upgrading work XZH was identified through
comprehensive comparison by Henan Provincial Planning,
Survey and Design Institute on the basis of different
suggestion carefully obtained from department at various
level . Suggestion raised by local government and people at
different level was extensively listened when determing the
scheme of upgrading works . In addtion, recommendation and
suggestion put forward by local public people was
investigated before defining the design of service road and
passageway. Local government and public people's intersest
was considered to a large extent.
At the initial phase of Environmental Impact Assessment of
the project, seminar meeting was held in Zhengzhou hosted by
Henan Provincial Environmental Protection Bureau and with
participation of local environmental protection department,
design unit and some people relating to the EIA . The
participants in the meeting focused on discussion regarding
the issue to be noticed in the EIA of the upgraidng project,
highlight of evaluation, environmental protection objective
in the EIA etc. also , they obtained the same understanding
for environmental standard to be adopted in the EIA report .
After end of the seminar , Xinxiang , Zhengzhou environmental
protection  Bureau  has  respectively  present  written
recommentation of environmental standard to be performed in
the EIA , which provide very important basis for the said EIA
report
After completion of outline on EIA for XZH, Henan Provincial
Environmental Protection Bureau have ever held the technical
evaluation meeting for the outline of EIA , and evaluation
instructions from the experts and representitives was raised
in the meeting . Later on , Henan Provincial Environmental
Protection Bureau approved the outline with written letter
in which agree in principle the identified component in the
EIA outline ,and also provide important basis to do the better
work on EIA through raising requirement on the several issues
to be noticed in the EIA .
During environmental present monitoring in the EIA, the
relevant personnel visited the People's Congress, Political
Consultation   department   and   other   non-Governmental
Organization along the route , seeking for environmental
protection issue in implementation, construction and
operation stage  , and suggestion regarding location of
service road and passageways from the representitives of the
People's Congress at each level, memeber of the political
consultation and non-Government Organization people along

tfie roi4". The investigated result was summarized as follows
below:
a. 'The proposed upgrading project 'XZH can replenish to a
certain extent the disadvange of the existing highway without
access-controled  and  interchanges  being  adopted.  The
proposed project can play an important role in raising driving
speed of the motorized vehicle, reducing traffic accident,
and developing the favarable benefit from the highway
section . Hence, the upgrading work as a temporary scheme
is reasonable , which is acceptable to the inquired people .
b. Xingxiang--Zhengzhou expressway and the second Yellow
River Bridge shall be prepared as soon as possible so as to
essentially rectify traffic condition on XZ section of
highway ;
c. The growth speed of the motorized vehicle along the route
shall be taken into account in design standard of service
road ; sufficient passageways shall be built in order to
ensure normal exchange of residents on both side of highway
upon completio of upgrading works .
d. With Zhengzhou city's development, south section of YR on
the proposed project will basically become the area of
Zhengzhou city ,thus effective separation measures on the
section shall be taken so as to minimize traffic accident;
a certain distance shall be set aside which can not newly
locate shop, restaurant or other city facilities
e. Location of overpass pedestrian on south section of YR
shall be combined with Zhenghou's city planning
8.2 Questionnaire Findings and Analysis
In mid December 1997 when present status of environmental
monitoring being proceeded, questionnaires regarding the
upgrading project and some ,ssue of environmental protection
were distributed among the residents along the route. Out of
200 questionnair , 180 were returned by the local people and
the feedback percent of questionnair is of 90% .                       N
Out of feedback questionnairs, 88 were contributed by the
farmers including 5 from villiage leader; 36 by the workers;
40 by business person; 16 by others (including State civil
servant , teachers etc.). The interviewees include 5 the
People's congress representitives and political consultation
commissioners with different title , see Table 8--1 and table
8--2 for professional constitution of the interviewees and
educational level of the interviewees respectively .

Chapter 9 Conclusion
*~ -..  -.-'e;-'-t--.,    .'       -     -
9.1  _Upgrading- Xinxiang--Zhengzhou Class I highway to
exprestay  standard  is  .a  temporary  project  before
construction of-:XZ expressway and the second Yellow River
bridge and is an important significant for solving future
traffic issue between Xinxiang and Zhengxhou .
The proposed project is located in north part of Henan
Province and on both bank of Yellow River . Around year
2000,  only  Xinxiang--Zhengzhou  section  on  Beijing--
Zhumadian corridor was two in one" condition between NTH
107  and  JingZhu  Major  Trunk  highway       It  is  very
necessary to upgrade XZH in order to improve traffic
condition on the said section of highway , even if XZ
expressway and the second Yellow River bridge is
completed, this section is still very important to solve
mixed traffic between Xinxiang and Zhengzhou .
The major work quantity of the upgrading work mainly
focus on north section of YR where will newly build one
simple interchange, 24 overpass separation interchanges,
9 passageways , 73.348km of newly bUilt approach and
service road ; on south section of YR, access-controlled,
separation and installation of traffic signal are the
major  upgrading  work  , beside  of  these,  9 overpass
pedestrians will be newly built on this section of
upgraing work .
Regarding environmental impact factor during construction
stage of upgrading work , impact factor on environment of
north section YR is more than that on south section and
YRB itself . Environmental impact factors on north
section include construction noise, blown dust, asphalt
smoking, borrow soil due to construction etc.. while
environmental impact of construction noise is the only
factor existing on YRB and south section of YR during
construction stage
9.2   Present status of acoustic environmental quality
along the alignment is poor . Environmental air quality
*         on  south  section  of  YR  can  not meet  the  Grade  II
standard . Lead content in the farmlayer of soil along
the   route   belongs   to   normal   level   .  Through
investigation, there have no precious plant or animal
distributed along the highway, nor have special sensitive
area of natural protection area and cultural relics .
As monitoring evaluation, acoustic quality of XZH fail to
meet  the Grade  "4"  stipulated in    nviromental  Noise
Standard for Urban Area" (GB3096--93). Environmental
80



noise equivalent level at daytime for many section -is
above 70dB (A) with the highest value 75.3dB(A) while
environmental noise equivalent level at night are also
lOdB(A)  above   the EIA standard limit with the higest
value of 73.2dB(A)which is 18.2dB(A)above the standard
limit . Noise source around the area along the route is
mainly from vehicle traffic noise on the existing highway
107 XZH section
As the evaluation monitoring results, environmental air
quality on north of YR can reach the Grade II standard in
environmental Air Quality Standard"(GB3095--1996),but TSP
daily concentration in air almost close concentration
limit value . Air environmental quality on south section
of YR fail to meet the standard, and the over-limit indix
is TSP whose highest daily concentration value up to
0.865mg/m3    ,   which    is    1.9    times    of    EIA
Standard .Generally, air environmental quality on north
section of YR is better than that on south section and
the pollutant in air is TSP .
Lead content in the farm layer of soil of the area near
the alignment is far blow the Grade II of standard limit
content   stipulated   in   soil   Environmental   Quality
standard". The highest value of lead content in the
farmlayer of soil up to 21.56mg/kg, which  is only 7.2%
of the EIA Standard .
Through serious checking, no precious plant or animal
exists  in  lkm  of  both  side  of  highway  ,  also  no
environmental special sensitive area such as natural
protection  area,   wetland   ,recovery  spot  etc.   are
distributed in this area.
9.3    Various kind of unfavorable impact on environment
during construction stage' can be acceptable, little
impact would be made on the sensitive point during
operation stage , and there would be no clear social
interruption after completion of upgrading work
Various   environmental   impact  factors       are  mainly
assembled on north section of YR during construction
stage  , and impact range of construction noise,  blown
dust , asphalt smoking is the area within 200m around
construction boundary , and  serious impact area is the
area within lOOm around construction boundary . However,
we can see from distribution of the sensitive point of
the project along the route that after some necessary
measures  being  adopted,   unfavorable  impact  due  to
construction can be acceptable .During construction
stage, there have the problem of interruption between
construction activity and the existing traffic access for
the whole highway section . this problem shall be
resolved through some measures according to actual
.81



specific  circumstance  in  construction  and  existing
traffic volume,  which will enable interruption of such
two parties to be reduced the minimized degree.
During operation stage upon completion of the project,
vehicle traffic noise will seriously influence the area
within 40m of both side of highway where the traffic
noise equivalent level in day hours would above 8OdB(A)
while such value at night would above 7OdB(A). On the
sensitive point along the route, traffic noise equivalent
level at day peak hours would beyond 7OdB(A), in other
cases, traffic noise equivalent level are blow the EIA
Standard limit. When estimated value of traffic noise
plus present value of environmental noise , environmental
noise at   sensitive point is mostly above the standard
limit, partly for present value of environmental noise
equivalent level at the sensitive point is slightly
higher.
As  estimated,   under  condition  of  stability        from
catalogue of neutral  to stable at average windward and
wind  speed  in  one  year  ,  average  of  one  hour
concentration  of  CO    in  environmental  air  at  the
sensitive point are not above the Standard limit , with
the highest value 1.771mg/mn3 accounting for 17.7% of the
Standard  limit;  prediction  results  for  No,  (average
concentration for 1 hour) also are not above the Standard
limit ,but on sensitive point of south section of YR, the
highest value of No, (average concentration for 1 hour)
are  all  above  0.13mg//m3  with  the  highest  value  of
0.143mg/m3 accounting for 95.3% of the Standard limit .
When prediction value of average concentration of CO ,and
of    No. plus  their  cooresponding  present  monitoring
value , the total value of average concentration for 1
hour of CO are still below the Standard limit while total
value of NO. are above the Standard, such over-limit value
were measured at the daytime peak hours of traffic
volume , in other cases, average concentration value of
No, are not above the standard limit .
As estimated calculation, until the end of evaluation
term (2019), lead content in the farmlayer of soil
adjacent to the area along the route may reach to
4          41.835mg/kg, which is still below the Grade II standard
in   soil   Environmental   Quality   Standard"(GB15618--
1995)accounting for 13.9% of the standard limit content .
With changes of the traffic volume, above environmental
impact from 2004 to 2007 would be the lowest value .
Upon completion of the project, highway traffic condition
between   Xinxinag--zhengzhou   will   be   significantly
improved  ,  which  will  promote  development  of  local
82.



economy and social activity along the route and reduce
traffic accident
Upon completion the project, due to sufficient newly
built passageways , overpass bridge and rehabilitation of
existing passageways, and newly built service road on the
left side and local road on the right side , there would
be no serious social interruption after completion of
upgrading works.
9.4   Through comparison analysis, this EIA report agree
the recommended alignment raised in the FSR , i.e
upgrading the existing National highway 107. In
order to minimize various environmental impact of
the project, mitigation measures of environmental
impact need to be adopted in design stage,
construction stage as well as operation stage
Through comparison in many respects, this EIA report
think the recommended alignment in the FSR, i.e upgrading
the existing national highway 107 , is reasonable;
environmental impact due to the recommended alignment is
lower than the alternative alignment, i.e newly built a
expressway in the south of YR in length of 26.2km .
In chapter 6 of the EIA report indicated the mitigation
measures of environmental impact to be adopted in design
stange,.  construction   stage   as  well  as  operation
stage  .The  design  unit,   contractors  and  operation
administration  dearptment  realating  to  the  proposed
project shall deal with these measures and suggestions in
order to minimize environmental impact to the lowest
degree.
The existing environmental management system on XZH has
set up which shall fully perform its function of
environmental management system during the proposed
upgrading and in operation stage .
Environmental  monitoring  program  in  construction  and
operation stage can be found in the Chapter 6 .
Environmental Monitoring Center in Henan Provincial
Highway Administration shall seriously perform monitoring
program  and  also  shall   replenish  or  revise   the
environmental program against actual requirement in the
actual monitoring work.
The environmental management and monitoring personnel
relating to the project have been strictly trained . The
training on the said personnel will not be re -described
in this project
83



-9'5   Economic benefit of the project is ramarkable and
environmental investment- is properly necessary.
Economic internal rate of return is 15.27% , Economic Net
Present Value is 95.4409 million yuan, Economic Benefit
Cost Ratio is 1.214, recovery term is 17 year , all- f
which can explain economic benefit of the project is
remarkable
Environmental  investment  amounts  to  Y6.933  million,
accounting for 1.3% of the total investment cost which is
reasonable
9.6  The majority of local resident along the route of
the project actively support to upgrade the existing
highway .
Through investigation, most of loacal resident and non-
goverment organization can activly support the upgraidng
work. only few of them (5%) assume that upgrading work
would influence normal exchange of both side of highway
and hope such issue could be sovled properly .
9.7  Enviromently, the scheme of upgrading work XZH is
reasonable  and  the  upgrading  work  is  a  feasible
engineering work .
Accordingly,   provided   that   mitigation  measures   or
suggestions of enviromental impact proposed in the
Chapter 6 can be seriously adopted, enviromently, as
indicated in the EIA Report, the scheme of upgrading work
XZH is reasonable and  the upgrading work is a feasible
engineering work
.
