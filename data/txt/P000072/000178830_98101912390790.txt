PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF BENIN
COTONOU PORT PROJECT
I. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A.   General
1.01      Located on the southern coast of the bulge of West Africa, Benin
lies between Togo to the west, Upper Volta 2and Niger to the north, and Nigeria
to the east. It has an area of 112,600 km and a population of about 3.3 mil-
lion growing at about 2.8% a year. The country is long and narrow, stretching
about 700 km north to the Niger border, and less than 350 km at its widest
point. The terrain is relatively flat or rolling, except for the Atakora
mountain chain in the northwest, thus creating a natural transport corridor
from land-locked Niger to the sea. Benin has scarcely any known mineral
resources.
1.02      Benin's economy is based on agriculture, which supports about
80% of the population and accounts for one-third of gross domestic product
(GDP) and 90% of foreign exchange earnings. The main commercial crops are
palm products, cotton and groundnuts (providing about 80% of the value of
exports but only 10% of agricultural production). The main domestic food
crops are maize, sorghum, yams and cassava, of which only 15% to 20% is
marketed. Insufficient and irregular rainfall limits the production of high
value tree crops. While the estimated nationwide per capita GDP in 1975 was
about US$140, the per capita GDP for the rural sector was only about US$50.
The Government hopes to increase production of both food crops and commercial
crops.
B.   The Transport System
1.03      Benin has a reasonably well-developed transport system.  The focal
point of the system is Cotonou 1/ where the country's only deep-water port
is located. The port of Cotonou is the starting and finishing point for the
most important element of the transport system -- the Benin route, the prin-
cipal artery for carrying goods to and from Niger. In addition to the port,
the Benin route includes the Cotonou-Parakou Railway (Central Line) and the
paved road from Parakou to Malanville (Map IBRD 13125).
1.04      Rail and trucking services on the Benin route, for the most part,
are run by the Organisation Commune Benin-Niger des Chemins de Fer et des
Transports (OCBN) which is a financially autonomous agency, established in
1/   While Porto Novo remains the official capital and administrative center,
Cotonou, the major commercial center, is slowly becoming the de facto
capital. The presidential palace and many government departments
are already located there.



1959 by the governments of Benin and Niger. However, since 1967, Niger has
restricted its interest in OCBN to matters such as tariffs and the allocation
of freight between truckers from Benin and Niger. OCBN not only operates the
Central Line but also charters the trucks which carry freight between Parakou
and Niger, thus giving OCBN a near monopoly on Niger transit traffic. After
goods have been transferred to truck at Parakou, in principle two-thirds of
the goods destined for Niger are to be carried by Niger truckers and one-third
by Benin truckers. Excluded from this arrangement are goods (including
petroleum products) to and from the uranium mines in Niger, which are carried
exclusively by the Societe Nationale des Transports Nigeriens (SNTN).
1.05      I'he principle components of Benin's domestic freight traffic are:
(i) local traffic -- mainly agricultural products; (ii) exports -- vegetable
oil, seed-cake and cotton (seed and fiber); (iii) imports -- building materials,
machinery and equipment, grain and other food products, and petroleum pro-
ducts;and (iv) transit traffic to and from Niger and Nigeria. Total transport
demand in the next decade is expected to grow at about 6% to 7% annually.
Railways
1.06      The railway network consists of the Central Line (Cotonou-Parakou,
438 km) and two secondary lines -- the western coastal line (Cotonou-Segboroue
34 km) and the eastern coastal line (Cotonou-Pobe, 107 km).  Between Cotonou
and Parakou, OCBN bears the main responsibility for transporting goods to and
from northern Benin and Niger. The two shorter lines (Cotonou-Segboroue and
Cotonou-Pobe) carry passengers almost exclusively. In 1976 OCBN carried about
288,000 tons of freight, of which about 181,200 tons (or 63%) were destined
for or originated in Niger. Tonnage has hovered around 300,000 tons for the
past five years.
Highways
1.07      Benin's road network totals about 7,200 km.  Of this, 759 km are
paved and 2,592 km are all-weather laterite roads. The rest of the network
consists of partly improved earth roads and tracks. The most heavily
travelled roads are those along the coast connecting Cotonou with Nigeria
and Togo and the road north to Niger. While the distribution of roads appears
sufficient for the country's need, their poor condition curtails their useful-
ness. Only about two-thirds of the paved roads are in satisfactory condition,
and only about half of the laterite roads are well enough maintained to permit
all-weather travel. Two recently approved Bank Group projects--a highway
rehabilitation project and a feeder roads project--are part of a program to
improve roads and to build up Benin's maintenance capacity.
1.08      Until recently, the Government curbed competition from road trans-
port by discouraging construction of the Bohicon-Parakou road beyond gravel
standards and generally restricting traffic to cars and light trucks. Doing
so gave the railway a near monopoly on freight traffic. The Government re-
cently changed this policy as part of an attempt to capture as much Niger



- 3 -
transit traffic as it can. At the Government's request, the European Develop-
ment Fund (EDF) has agreed to finance paving of the first section (Bohicon-
Dassa Zoume) of the unpaved link between Bohicon and Parakou. The agreement
with EDF also includes feasibility and final engineering studies of the Dassa
Zoume-Parakou section which will probably be constructed under the Fifth EDF
replenishment, i.e. in the early 1980's and will complete a bituminous road
parallel to the OCBN railway over its entire length.  While this will permit
direct shipment from Cotonou to Niamey and thereby most likely result in
reduced transport costs, it will also result in a loss of traffic for the
railway. The Government, therefore, is keeping its railway investments at
prudent levels, and the proposed project includes a study of future railway
demand.
Air Transport
1.09      The only international airport is located in Cotonou and is used
by some of the major airlines serving the region. Total passenger traffic,
excluding transit traffic, averaged about 45,800 per year between 1972 and
1974. During the same period, freight traffic averaged slightly less than
2,700 tons per year, but reached about 3,200 tons in 1975. There are five
small secondary airfields, but the country's size and poverty makes domestic
air transport rather unimportant.
Transport Investment and Financing
1.10      Investments in the transport sector averaLged about CFAF 1.5 billion
(US$6.1 million) annually between 1970 and 1975, amounting to about 25% of
total public investment. Of this amount, about CFAF 1.3 billion (US$5.3
million) per year was spent on highways. Major investments in the port and
the airport were completed before 1972, and no significant investments in
them have been made since. One of the Government's priorities for transport
investment is improving Cotonou port. Investments now under way, covering
the most urgent needs of the Benin route, amount to about $70 million, about
15% of the Government's total investments over the next three years. In
addition to the proposed project, these investments include new motive power
and rolling stock for the railway, improvements at the port and railway
terminal at Parakou, and new open storage areas.
C.   The Transit Function
1.11      gince Niger, one of the largest land-locked countries in Africa (1.3
million km ), is about 1,000 km from the sea, it must depend on neighboring
countries, primarily Benin, for access to ocean transport. Both Niger's popu-
lation (estimated at 5.3 million in 1977) and GDP (CFAF 93 billion in 1973)
are larger than Benin's. Between 1959 and 1967 the GDP grew at 10% p.a. but
slowed thereafter due mainly to drought in the Sahel region. The economy,
however, should again grow substantially because of agricultural projects and
development of the mining sector. By 1990 Niger exports via Cotonou should be
about one-quarter of Benin's, while the two countries' imports through the



port will be nearly equal (600,000 tons to 650,000 tons).  In 1976 Niger
exports through Cotonou were about 17% of Benin's and its imports were about
42% of Benin's.
1.12      Nigeria, Benin's neighbor to the east, is the most populous country
in Africa (70-80 million) and potentially one of the richest, already deriving
important revenues from oil.  The income from oil which has enabled Nigeria to
import massive quantities of goods coupled with the damage resulting from the
civil war to the ports and railways have created extraordinary congestion in
Nigeria's ports. Ship waiting time is counted in months, and ships are
frequently diverted to neighboring ports, including Cotonou.
1.13      The prospects for substantial growth in traffic of the port of
Cotonou are favorable for two main reasons:
(i)  The Benin route is by far the cheapest access to the sea
for western Niger. Revenue from the expected growth of Niger
uranium production should increase imports significantly.
(ii) S:ince 1975, the port of Cotonou has been used increasingly
by Nigerian importers wishing to avoid congestion in Nigerian
ports. It is possible they will continue to use Cotonou until
tthe congestion is eliminated.
1.14      Most major Beninese transporters and associated activities have
been nationalized since 1975. Thus the greater part of the substantial
revenues generated by transit traffic goes to the Government. The Government
intends to improve transport infrastructure to encourage the development of
the transit traffic to and from neighboring countries, since the growth of
Benin's economy relies largely on the development of this traffic, mainly with
Nigeria. As the table below indicates, the annual real growth rate of Benin's
GDP can be divided into two distinct phases: (i) 1972-74 when all sectors
grew very little or not at all, and (ii) the last three years which registered
a boom in transit traffic and an associated growth of GDP of about 9% p.a.

1.15      The leading sectors were those related tc trade or transport activi-
ties with neighboring countries, i.e. commerce, transport, modern industry
and to a certain extent the transport infrastructure. The sharp growth of
these sectors is due to Benin's increasing importance as an entrepot and
supplier for its dynamic neighbor, Nigeria. Direct transit trade with Lagos
and western Nigeria via the port of Cotonou, only 120 km from Lagos, has
increased sharply in the past three years as the demand for port facilities
has far surpassed Nigeria's capacity. There is also a large indirect transit
trade for western Nigeria. Goods such as luxury items and textiles are
imported by Beninese trading firms and subsequently find their way--by truck,
by pirogue on the coastal lagoons or by head-loading--to Nigeria. Value added
in commerce is now second only to that of the agricultural sector, and in
market prices (adding in net indirect taxes) commerce contributes over three-
quarters as much to GDP as agriculture.
1.16      Benin's small modern industrial sector has also expanded very
rapidly in the recent years in response to Nigerian demand for such items
as printed cloth, beverages and food products. Relatively low inflation,
the availability of cheap labor, good transport facilities, the traditional
interest of Beninese in commercial activities, a convertible currency (the
CFAF) and a good relationship between Benin and Nigeria all make Benin an
ideal manufacturing and trading base for the Nigerian market.
1.17      The port of Cotonou, which was initially designed to satisfy the
demand of traditional traffic of Benin and Niger, has become inadequate.
Congestion at Cotonou has already caused diversion of a significant amount of
Niger traffic to Lome (60,000 t in 1977) despite higher costs and has caused a



-6-
dramatic increase in ship waiting time and service time. As a consequence,
surcharges of 20% to 35% have been imposed on Cotorou traffic by shipowners.
As the proposed project will not be completed befc-e the end of 1980, the Port
Autonome dje Cotonou and the Office Beninois des Manutentions Portuaires are
implementing an intermediate project to increase port capacity through the
purchase of handling equipment and the creation of new storage and stacking
areas with the assistance of the Banque Ouest Africaine de Developpement
(BOAD) andl the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD).
II. THE PORT OF COTONOU
A.   General
2.01      The coastline of Benin is a low sandy beach with no natural harbors.
It is typical of many West African countries in that there is a strong pre-
dominait littoral transport from west to east; rates as high as 1.5 mil-
lion m oi- sand per year have been recorded. The first facility for handling
cargo for ships was a steel-piled wharf built at Cotonou in 1891. Studies
were made between 1955 and 1959 for a single new port for both Benin and Togo;
the site Selected was at Cotonou. The port was built from 1959 to 1965.
While the site chosen was probab.ly as good as any available, the location has
a number of underlying weaknesses, the most important of which are: (i) the
constraints to development caused by its proximity to the town of Cotonou and
the main roadway, and (ii) the downdrift erosion problems which affect the
entrance to the Cotonou Lagoon and the valuable lands to the east of the port.
Since 196'; no additional works have been carried out, and until recently
maintenance was poor. A major extension of the industrial fishing port was
studied under EDF financing, but implementation has been delayed due to the
negative growth rate of the local fishing fleet and the delay in the start-up
of a national fishing enterprise.
B.   Port Characteristics
2.02      The concept of the harbor is very simple.  Two breakwater arms
stretch out from the sand beach to enclose an area of protected water. The
breakwaters are massive rock fill structures armored with heavy rock and
tetrapods.. They are effective in reducing swell wave activity within the port
to very low levels and have proved to be almost maintenance free. The break-
waters cause accretion of sand updrift from the west breakwater and erosion
downdrift from the! east breakwater. Because of the interruption of transport
of the large volume of sand, the zone of coastline affected by the port is
very long, extending seven km downdrift (Map IBRD 13126).



- 7 -
2.03      The accretion of sand to the west of the port is causing the shore-
line to advance steadily seawards, which will contirnue until an equilibrium
is reached and sand then bypasses the breakwaters. This point was almost
reached in late 1977. The area of land created by the advancement of the
shoreline will allow the port to expand to the west. The 1975 port master
plan shows future expansion of the port facilities iLn this area but recommends
the construction of a cut-off breakwater projecting seawards from the west
breakwater to continue the accretion, thereby providing additional land neces-
sary to complete the master plan. This cut-off breakwater would also delay
the date when the sand would begin to bypass the breakwaters and postpone for
several years the need for maintenance dredg-ng of the port= Maintenance
dredging of the present port entrance was necessary once in 1974.
2.04      Inside the harbor are 640 m of marginal berths (four berths) for
general cargo vessels, with four transit sheds and open storage areas; a small
fishing port for industrial fishing vessels with an ice plant and cold store;
and a beach used by traditional fishing pirogues. About 30 m of the berth
cannot be used because it is the extreme west end corner with shallow depths.
The maximum operating drafts within the port areas are 9.45 m and 9.14 m, with
a tidal variation of 1.2 m. As originally planned, the eastern breakwater was
to have berths 11 m deep on both sides for use by bulk vessels and tankers for
imports and exports. However, excessive swell wave activity has made it
impossible to use the outside face. A small area used for the storage of bulk
clinker for cement manufacture is located at the root of the breakwater
together with a 200-ton synchrolift tvne dry-dock for port tugs, service
vessels and fishing vessels. Navigation in and out of the port area is simple
with no buoyed channels, hazards or obstructions. Vessels berth with the aid
of the port's 1400-hp tugs.
2.05      On shore there are not enough open areas available for stacking
cargo and for general access. The port has adequate office buildings for
the administrative and technical services, and some space (although insuffi-
cient) for the port's users and freight forwarders. There is a shortage of
office accommodation close to the port area. The road access and railway
network are adequate but need maintenance. Within the port is a servicing
center for the cargo-handling equipment; this is a poor, only partly completed
facility needing better management.
C.   Port Administration
2.06      The port of Cotonou is run by the Port Autonome de Cotonou (PAC), an
autonomous public agency. The decree governing PAC was extensively revised to
its present form in October 1976 (Ordinance No. 76--SS). Although financially
independent of the Government, PAC is administratively under the Ministry of
Transport. The Minister of Transport takes an active interest in the manage-
ment and activities of the port. It has 336 permanent employees and 68 tempo-
rary employees. All cargo handling and stevedoring operations are the respon-
sibility of another government agency, the Office Bleninois des Manutentions
Portuaires (OBEMAP) (paras. 2.17 and 2.18).

2.07      A 25-member board of administration sets the policy for PAC.  Of
these 25 members, 7 represent the legislature and the ministries; 5, port
workers; 7, public and private agencies having direct interest in the port;
and 6, neighboring countries using the port (Niger 3, and 1 each from Togo,
Upper Volta and Nigeria). The board is headed by a president; he and four
board members (including one of the representatives from Niger) constitute a
committee of administration to deal regularly with port matters. The managing
director, assistant managing director, harbor master and chief accountant
handle the day-to-day operation of the port. The recently appointed PAC
general manager has had no previous experience in port management. Both
he and his deputy need additional training, which they would receive under the
proposed project (para. 3.19).
D.   Port Operations and Maintenance
2.08      Port operations and maintenance are carried out by PAC and OBEMAP
with no overlap. Both are government agencies and could be merged to form
one unit. Although this has been proposed on a number of occasions, the
Government prefers to retain two separate organizations, a position which
causes no overriding problems.
2.09      PAC is responsible for pilotage and berthing of vessels and for
providing and maintaining port facilities, i.e., the berths, sheds, fencing,
weighbridges, floodlights and services. In recent years the maintenance of
the port has been poor because PAC lacks a qualified technical staff to
initiate, control and manage the work. As a consequence there has been a
substantial backlog of urgent maintenance items; work on these items is
underway with FAC financing the US$400,000 cost.
2.10      The 24-hour pilotage, tug and other marine services are operated
by PAC through the harbor master who is also the senior pilot. Vessels
awaiting berths anchor in the roadstead offshore from the port entrance and
are allocated berths according to their status. Recently an average of 17 or
18 vessels have been waiting for berths or services. Priority berth assignment
is accorded to conference vessels, regular callers, or ships carrying cargo
urgently needed by the governments of either Nigeria or Benin. The number of
pilots available (four in October 1977) is insufficient. PAC employs both
local and expatriate pilots, but low salaries make it difficult to retain new
pilots and it is difficult to recruit expatriates. Considerable improvements
in the service could be made by changing administrative procedures for the
documentation for vessels, particularly enabling a vessel to sail immediately
after discharging cargo. In many cases there is a delay of two to three
hours. These problems will be studied under the port operations segment of
technical assistance to the project.
2.11      The port operates two identical 1400-hp tugs, one of which has
just been acquired and is equipped for fire-fighting.  The small dry-dock



-9-
in the port is of sufficient capacity to maintain the hulls of the tugs.
The posts of captain and chief engineer for the tugs have been difficult
to fill and some expatriates are employed.
2.12      There are insufficient open storage and circulation areas within
the port. One zone is reserved solely for cargo to or from Niger. Included
in this zone are silos for the storage of cereals, a large warehouse/transit
shed and a railway spur. An elevated pipeline leads to the berths so that
bulk grain and fertilizers can be discharged directly from the ship to the
zone.
2.13      During the preparation of this project a detailed study of the
port highlighted the operating problems and deficiencies and recommended
productivity targets, management improvements and new equipment. More recently,
the Government invited the UNCTAD "Port Congestion Task Force" team to visit
the port and to advise on how the present throughput problems could be resolved.
2.14      These studies found that, omitting the question of berth space,
the following were the principal causes of port congestion:
(a) delay in removing cargo from the port area, due to: (i) the
complexity of the documentation and paymetnt of charges and
taxes on the cargo, (ii) the very slow manner in which
the consignees and the freight-forwarding companies work,
and (iii) the overgenerous free storage periods for goods;
and
(b) the lack of sufficient open storage areas and transit sheds.
A committee has been set up under the Minister of Transport to study and
improve items (a)(i) and (a)(ii) above. BOAD is fiLnancing increased open
storage areas and a mobile crane at Parakou and at the port, two barges, a new
tug (already delivered) and a transit shed. The total cost of the project
is CFAF 1.380 billion (US$5.3 million) of which BOAD will lend CFAF 1 billion
(US$4.08 million).
2.15      As a step to relieve congestion PAC has constructed a large open
storage area for Nigerian goods on the east side of the Cotonou lagoon at
Akpakpa. An area 185 m by 300 m with good road and rail access was due to be
completed in February 1978. It will later be expanded as funds permit.
Another measure to relieve congestion has been to load Niger cargo directly
onto the railway wagons, dispatch it to the Parakou terminal, and document and
clear the goods from there. While this helps to relieve port congestion, it
simply transfers the congestion problem to Parakou.
2.16      Five items essential to improving port operations are:  (a)  physical
improvements within the confines of the port; (b) training and management of
the cargo-handling personnel; (c) additional equipment and much improved
maintenance; (d) charges levied on badly loaded vessels; and (e) removal of
unacceptable, damaged cargo from the port after the free storage periods. The
proposed project will address items (a) and (b); PAC and OBEMAP will be
responsible for items (c), (d) and (e), with technical assistance for item (c).



- 10 -
2.17      OBEMAP, created as an autonomous government agency in 1969 under
the Ministry of Transport, is responsible for practically all cargo handling
and stevedoring within the port. Freight-forwarding companies can, if neces-
sary, use their own resources to load trucks or wagons. OBEMAP is headed by a
15-member board and a management team assisted by a committee of administration.
The staff numbers 2,300, of whom 1,500 are dockworkers. The entire management
staff is new and inexperienced. There is a serious shortage of qualified and
skilled personnel from top to bottom, and technical assistance and training
are badly needed. Apart from the chief of cargo-handling operations, all the
supervisory staff need additional training, which will be provided under the
proposed project (para. 3.19).
E.   Port Capacity
2.18      At Cotonou, productivity depends largely on the efficiency of
OBEMAP. The port is operating at about its maximum capacity for general
cargo, but with some spare capacity for bulk materials. In order to maintain
the present throughput, PAC and OBEMAP have instituted 24-hour shift opera-
tions which are poorly supervised and controlled and consequently expensive.
The productivity of the gangs in handling general cargo is about seven tons/
hour, but often this is not achieved because the ship's gear is very old or
poor (50% of the vessels calling at Cotonou fall into this category) or
because the vessels have been badly loaded.
2.19      The general cargo capacity of the port is estimated at 720,000 tons
per year, of which 160,000 tons is traffic discharged on the east breakwater.
The berth occupancy rate is more than 90% under these conditions and the
throughput can be stated as 850 tons per year per meter of quay. The project
would provide an additional 660 m of berths and increased open and covered
storage areas. When the project is completed, it will be possible to revert
from the expensive 24-hour operations to a system of two 8-hour shifts plus
overtime when necessary. With the increased berth length, plus improved
productivity due to technical assistance and training, the throughput achiev-
able under normal working conditions (two shifts) should be 830 tons per meter
of quay giving a new theoretical port capacity of 1,050,000 tons for general
cargo only. This cargo figure does not include roll-on/roll-off (ro-ro), con-
tainer vessels, bulk carriers and vehicle carriers which can be accommodated
on the east breakwater berths. In terms of productivity per gang/hour, the
proposed project should increase the present average rate of 7.1 tons/gang/
hour for general cargo to at least 10.0 tons/gang/hour, and the Government has
agreed to ensure that this goal will be met within six months after the civil
works included in the project become fully operational.
F.   Port Planning
2.20      A master plan for the development of the port of Cotonou, prepared
by BCEOM and completed in early 1975, was accepted by the Government, PAC and
the Association. The master plan can only be realized if sufficient land is



- 11 -
up to accommodate the new basin. Consequently the proposed cut-off breakwater
extending seawards from the existing west breakwater arm is essential to
continue the present accretion and is included in the project.
2.21      Roll-on/roll-off cargo is increasing rapidly, and the port is unable
to handle such vessels efficiently.  Such a facility is necessary snd PAC
has been considering how to provide it. Possibly the best solution would be
to acquire a concrete decked barge with a bridge leaf to the quay. The barge
would be equipped with pumps to enable its deck level to be changed with tides
and varying types of vessel sill/ramp levels. A study of the facility will be
made and implemented during the project (paras. 3. 10 and 3.17(f)).
2.22      Two other important considerations in planning the development
of the proposed project are: (a) the location of the equipment repair and
maintenance workshop for PAC and OBEMAP, which occupies valuable land area and
badly needs rebuilding; and (b) the location of the bulk sulphur and clinker
stockpiles which also occupy valuable land, the discharge and stockpiling of
which also need to be improved. Both are the joint responsibility of PAC and
OBEMAP and recommendations on them have been made by the UNCTAD team. It is
possible that these works will be carried out by PAC and OBEMAP before the
project starts.
G.  Tariffs
2.23      PAC's tariffs for the use of its installations and services are
authorized by its Board and are basically classified according to the nature
of charges. General tariffs, fixed initially on the port's commissioning in
1965, were increased by an average of 25-30% in April 1974. The charges on
fishing vessels based at Cotonou have remained at the 1965 level; consequently,
fish traffic is subsidized by other traffic. Rental charges were revised
effective July 1, 1977. The tariffs are generally not cost-based, they have
not kept up with inflation and PAC's financial needs, and they require ex-
tensive revision. According to consultants BCEOM, PAC's charges on ships
are comparable to Lome's but substantially lower than those at Abidjan,
Pointe-Noire and Douala. PAC's tariffs on goods are on a par with those at
Lome and Pointe-Noire but lower than those at Abidjan and Douala. However,
Cotonou enjoys the economic advantage of being closer to Niger and Nigeria.
2.24      OBEMAP's tariffs for cargo handling operations must be approved by
the Minister of Transport and were last revised in September 1974. Tariffs
are classified by the type of service and appear adequate. However, they may
not remain so due to inflation and increases in depreciation when assets are
revalued and new equipment is acquired. Tariffs are not cost-related and need
revision and rationalization. A summary of PAC's and OBEMAP's tariffs is
appended as an Annex to the report.

H.   Accounting. Budgeting, Audit, Insurance
Accounting 
2.25      PAC's accounting is broadly based on commercial principles, but has
serious shortcomings. Receipts and expenses are classified according to their
nature and not according to port functions. In the absence of analytical or
cost accounting, the profitability of various services cannot be determined in
relation to costs. Legislation does not clearly define the financial objectives.
The purposes of two statutory reserve funds, built up by the transfer of 50%
of the net surplus, are not clear. The funds could be used to meet unforeseen
contingencies and development expenditure. Furthermore, suitable limits of
accumulation for these funds need to be prescribed. Further, as the accountant
and his staff require training in modern commercial accounting methods, and
the accounts preparation needs expediting, technical assistance to improve the
situation is provided under the project.
2.26      OBEMAP's accounting deficiencies are similar to PAC's.  Since it
plays a key role in the functioning of the port, its management and operations
must be improved.
Budgetint
2.27      PAC's budget format does not permit functional budgeting and budgetary
control. Analytical accounting would help to frame more realistic estimates
and permit management to monitor more efficiently the port's financial position
by department and activity. Improvement in the budgeting procedures should
also include long-term forecasts. Budgetary control should continue to vest
in the Accountant. The above remarks apply also to OBEMAP.
Audit
2.28      PAC's internal audit is restricted to annual stock-taking and
verification of expense vouchers and pay sheets. The Commercial Department
prepares bills and verifies these before issue. The latter function could
better be exercised independently by internal audit. The method for collec-
tion of demurrage charges offers scope for leakage, which is possibly taking
place. There should be a full-fledged internal audit section, possibly within
the Accounts Department to exercise extensive documentary and physical checks.
OBEMAP should also strengthen its internal audit in anticipation of expansion
in its activities, and technical assistance has been included in the project
for this.
2.29      External audit is conducted by two external auditors who verify
PAC's annual cash and other accounts. The accounts for 1974 were audited by a
qualified accountant, and those for 1975, by the same accountant and the civil
administrator. The audit was financial in character and some accounting
irregularities, like non-reconciliation of balances, under-provision for
doubtful fdebts and faulty presentation, were pointed out. However, PAC was
not criticized for the considerable increase (200% in 1974) in receivables



- 13 -
with a preponderant share owed by OBEMAP and other public concerns nor for
the impact of omission of substantial fixed assets from the accounts and
of the valuation of assets at historical costs. TbLe Government agreed that
PAC would arrange for qualified independent auditors to comment on wider
accounting and financial issues and to include financial management perform-
ance within the scope of their audit.
Insurance
2.30       Insurance coverage has been increased in recent years.  The Govern-
ment agreed that PAC would maintain adequate insuriance coverage for all of
PAC's structures, machinery and equipment, allowing for regular revaluation of
the existing assets and including the assets to be constructed or acquired
under the proposed project.
III. THE PROJECT
A. Background
3.01       The Association reviewed the master plan and the recommended first
stage of development with PAC and the Government in April 1975. As the pro-
posed project began to develop and co-financing organizations became inter-
ested, an alternative solution for phased development was offered by the Arab
Bank for Economic Development in Africa (BADEA). Since this approach appeared
to have merit for the first phase of development, an additional study was
undertaken by BCEOM and a report issued on the advantages and disadvantages
of the alternative solution. The results reaffirmed the original master
plan, with some modifications, as the most realistic and economical. The
study was financed by the Project Preparation Fac-Llity (PPF) (50%) and by
BADEA (50%), and the report issued in November 1976.
B. Obiectives
3.02       The objectives of the project are:
(a)   To increase the capacity of the port to handle break-bulk and
general cargo. Capacity will increase from 720,000 tons per
year to about 1,100,000 tons per year by increasing berth length
and storage areas. This increased capacity should suffice until
1985.
(b)   To improve the efficiency of PAC and CIBEMAP operations through
training programs, technical assistance and scholarships abroad.
(c)   To improve the operations of OCBN through technical assis-
tance programs.



- 14 -
(d) To ensure that Benin derives maximum benefit from the use
of the port of Cotonou for the transit of goods destined
to neighboring countries, while keeping the operational
efficiency and tariff structure of the Benin route
sufficiently competitive to attract 70% of Niger imports
through Atlantic ports.
(e)  To augment knowledge of the erosion problems occurring
downdrift from the port so the Government can control
erosion and plan and construct necessary shore protection
works.
C. Engineering Aspects: Scope, Engineering and Investigations
3.03      The project has been prepared by consulting engineers (BCEOM,
France), who have been closely involved with the port of Cotonou. They were
responsible for the original design and layout, the preparation of the port
master plan, a suggested first phase of development and various other studies.
The consultants arranged for detailed hydrographic and topographic surveys,
borings and other soil tests necessary, and designed and drew up the proposed
extension in accordance with the most recent master plan. All of the works
included in the port extension are similar to those in the original port and
consequently no special circumstances or problems should arise.
3.04      The dredging works have been split into two elements.  The first
will provide for deepening the entrance channel to the port and dredging
a silt/sand trap within the channel, thus delaying the need for future main-
tenance dredging. The second element consists of dredging the basin to
accommodate the extended length of marginal berths. The basin will be dredged
to accommodate a future berth length of 790 meters. This is longer than
required for the proposed extension of the berths under the project, but the
additional basin will allow for handling ro-ro and other small vessels, and
future expansion at minimal cost.
3.05      Since the master plan for the port requires increased land to
the west, accretion must continue. Therefore a cut-off breakwater seawards
from the present west breakwater must be built.
3.06      The port congestion, the inadequacy and insufficient numbers of
trained personnel, and the need for some remedial action, required a study on
port operations and cargo handling.   This was financed by FAC and undertaken
by the Port of Marseilles (France) and a port operations expert of FAC. The
engineering consultants have incorporated many of the the recommendations of
the study for improving port efficiency and cargo handling.

D. Description
3.07      The project can be divided into three sections, project preparation,
civil engineering works, and technical assistance.
Project Preparation
3.08      The project cost includes US$500,000 from IDA and US$100,000 from
BADEA for various studies necessary for preparation of the project.
Civil Engineering Works
3.09      The civil engineering works have been split into six separate
contract lots to simplify the parallel and joint financing of the project
by the various co-financers. The six lots are:
3.10      Lot 1 - Berth Construction.  The existing marginal berths will be
extended by 610 meters with a depth of 11 meters alongside. Then there will
be a further 50 meters, with a depth alongside varying from 11 meters to zero,
which will be used as a service berth for the port's tugs, pilot boats and
launches. In preparing the tenders, the consultants considered a number of
possible variations before deciding on sheet piling as the most economic
method. However, a number of the tenderers submitted a variation for an
in situ concrete quay wall which may be adopted fol:Lowing further study by
the consultants. The fendering system and bollards are similar to the pre-
vious installation. Also included within this lot is the provision of a
simple roll-on/roll-off facility. The most suitable and economic solution
will be studied under the technical assistance items (para. 3.17 (f)) of the
project and procured within the financing for Lot. 1. In all probability the
facility will be as described in para. 2.21.
3.11      Lot 2 - Dredging and Filling.  This lot is divided into two sections
since the dredging of the port entrance channel demands the use of floating
dredging equipment which can cope with the swell wave conditions, whereas
the dredging of the new basin can be carried out using land-based plant
or with simple floating equipment. Surplus material from the channel dredging
will be deposited close to the shore downdrift to the east of the port, and
surplus from the basin dredging and filling will be deposited ashore to the
west of the basin area.
3.12      Lot 3 - Breakwaters.  Practically all of the works included in thfs
lot involves the handling of heavy rock and br,takwater units. In order to gain
access to the new basin to be dredged to the west of the port it will be
necessary to remove 320 m of the west breakwater. The materials for the
construction of the cut-off breakwater will come from the demolition of the
320 m of the existing breakwater, an existing stock of rocks and tetrapods and
by the quarrying of new rock and tile casting of new tetrapods.
3.13      Lot 4 - Paving, roadworks, railway trackwork, services and fencing.
The services to be extended and provided are storm water drainage, foul
drainage, water distribution, fire hydrants, ropdways, sidewalks, entrances



- 16 -
and exits, public sanitary facilities, a weighbridge, the railway trackwork,
and extension of the existing customs fencing to enclose the new works. The
Hotel du Port, which will fall within the confines of the port customs area
duiring the extension, will be taken over by PAC.
3.14      Lot 5 - Transit sheds.  Two transit sheds will be constructed, each
of 120 m x 50 m as clear span portal structures, with partially translucent
roof sheeting and central ridge ventilation, eight sliding main doors and
walls of concrete with a louvred ventilation section at high level.
3.15      Lot 6 - Electrical works.  This comprises all of the electrical
works involved in the extension of the port facilities and other essential
electrical works.
Technical Assistance and Training
3.16      The project will provide technical assistance, training programs and
overseas training to PAC, OBEMAP and OCBN. Because of the importance of the
Benin route and the increasing competition, both domestic and international,
the tariff studies for each of the three agencies included in the proposed
project should be co-ordinated or, preferably, carried out by the same con-
sultant or expert. The cost of the technical assistance is estimated at
US$8,000 per man-month based on recent costs for technical assistance in the
region. In addition to the man-month costs, which amount to $1.46 million,
an additional sum of $0.35 million has been allowed for international travel
and transportation, small items of training equipment, expenses for Benin
staff selected for training overseas, and the costs of printing reports.
The broad outlines of this element of the project are as follows:
3.17      For PAC:
Four experts (60 man-months) who will:
(a) advise the management in port operations and control;
(b) reorganize the accounting system, introduce cost control
and cost-based tariffs, strengthen internal audit,
revalue the assets, and train staff;
(c) implement a maintenance program in the engineering section;
(d) set up training programs in the port for lower level employees
who handle and berth vessels, and for mechanics and technicians
who run the tugs, pilot boats and other vessels, and the port's
mechanical equipment;
(e) advise on the training of pilots, their conditions of
employment and pilotage charges; and



- 17 -
A consulting engineering firm (40 man-months) who will:
(f) study the need for a simple but economic form of roll-on/
roll-off facility for the port, develop and design the
facility agreed upon, and will assist PAC in implementing
and cofmissioning it.
The Government has agreed to appoint experts to assist PAC, on terms and
conditions acceptable to the Association, and has agreed to ensure prompt
and appropriate implementation of their recommendations.
3.18      For OBEMAP:  Three experts (60 man-months) who will:
(a)  work with the present chief stevedore to develop training
programs for all levels of staff;
(b)  select and recruit candidates to fill the vacant positions
of 2 assistant ;hief stevedores, 6 berth superintendents,
12 transit shed supervisors, and 15 berth gang foremen;
(c) institute a program of regular equipment maintenance and
renewal including training and recruiting of workshop
personnel and supervisors; and
(d)  reorganize the accounting system, introduce cost control,
strengthen internal audit, revalue assets, train staff,
and rationalize and revise tariffs.
The Government has agreed to appoint these consultants or experts to assist
OBEMAP, on terms and conditions acceptable to the Association, and has agreed
to ensure appropriate implementation of their recommendations.
3.19      Most training for PAC and OBEMAP staff will be in the port; short
overseLas training missions could be included for senior personnel.
3.20      For OCBN:  Two experts (22 man-months) who will:
(a) design a new layout for the railway terminal at Parakou to
improve the marshalling yard and the transshipment facilities;
(b)  re.ommend and implement improvements in operations
at the Parakou terminal, including staff training;
(c) review the traffic forecasts and determine the invest-
ments that may be needed to cope with expected demand
in the next 10 years;
(d) recommend improvements in operations and management;
('t)  recommend iruprovementt in traini-ig and staff de:.'e'opMent
policies; and
(f)  study and desigr. ti ntw tarifi structure fcr rail traffic
between Cotonou and Parikou and foa  road traffic betweer
between Parakou and Niger.

The costs for the civil engineering works shown above are from the consultants'
preliminary report on the evaluation of the tenders rieceived on April 15, 1978
for Lots 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6. When the report is completed and the final recom-
mendations made, the contract figures may change but probably not signifi-
cantly. The estimate used for Lot 2, dredging andd filling, was provided by
CIDA. The estimated costs include physical and price contingencies7 The
physical contingencies for each of the lots vary; however, the consultants
have recommended that 10% physical contingency be applied to each lot since
the cost figures are still provisional. The price contingencies are based on
the project implementation timetable and assume annual increases as follows:
1978, 8%; 1979, 7.5%; 1980 and onwards, 7%. The preparation of detailed cost
estimates for this project and particularly for the civil engineerings works
was difficult as there have been no major civil engineering works of any
similar nature or magnitude since the construction of the original port.
F. Financing
3.22     A considerable number of international and national financing
organizations were approached by the Government of Benin in 1976-1977 and
seven co-financers have agreed to participate in the project. During the
appraisal mission, four of the co-financers were present and some took part
in the discussions with the Government.
3.23     A co-financers meeting was held in Paris April 27 and 28, 1978 and
was attended by representatives from IDA, seven co-f-inancers and the Government
of Benin. The following financing plan was agreed upon:

3.24      Lots 1 and 4 will be financed jointly by the Association, Norway,
FAC, the African Development 3ark (AFDB) as agent for the Nigerian Trust Fund,
and PAC; procurement will be in accordance with the Association's practices.
Lot 2 will be financed ' parallel entirely by CIDA, under their own procure-
ment procedures. Lot 3 will be financed in parallel jointly by BADEA and PAC
and Lot 6 by the Abu Dihai Fund, under their own procurement procedures, but
using the tender documents prepared under the project. Lot 5 will be financed
by the CCCE in parallel under their own procurement procedures but using the
tender documents prepared under the project. The effectiveness of the pro-
posed credit would be contingent upon the effectiveness of the BADEA and AfDB
loan agreements, the CIDA, FAC and Norway grant agreements, and the authoriza-
tion of the Abu Dhabi and CCCE loans by these two institutions.
3.25      The cost of supervision of the civil works will be financed by
the Association and the Government.
3.26      All studies, technical assistance and training will be financed
by the Association and the Government. No charges will be imposed on
OCBN and OBEMAP for the cost of this assistance.
G. Implementation
3.27      The proposed project will be implemented by the Ministry of Trans-
portation under the supervision of an ad hoc commission specifically set up
to execute the project, following the timetable set forth in this report.
They will be assisted by engineering consultants and a project coordinator to
be recruited specifically for the task; UNDP financing has been requested for
the latter. A Benin counterpart, acceptable to the Association, will be
seconded to work with the project coordinator and will be financed under the
project. A condition of effectiveness of the proposed credit would be the
appointment, on terms and conditions acceptable to the Association, of the
engineering consultants and the project coordinator. Because of the large
number of cofinancers and the complexity of the project, it is desirable to
have a fulltime project coordinator.  le will be based in Cotonou for two
years and will assist the Government and PAC in implementing the project, keep
the co-financing organizations fully informed, deal with the day-to-day
problems, and will assist in recruiting technical assistance experts, setting
up training programs, and preparing terms of reference and contract documents.
To train and improve the quality of the PAC's engineering staff, suitably
qualified engineer employees acceptable to the Association will be seconded to
the consultant supervising the civil works. The proposed timetable for the
project, agreed upon by the Government and PAC, is shown as Chart 1 of Annex 2.
H. Procurement
Civil Works
3.28      On the basis of Bank guidelines for international competitive
bidding, the civil works were advertised internationally; 72 contracting



- 21 -
organizations expressed interest and 57 were retained following pre-selection.
Tenders were invited December 15, 1977 and were to be returned by noon on
April 14, 1978. Following a request by CIDA, Lot 2 was not included in the
tender documents as CIDA intends to finance this lot in parallel using
Canadian contractors and their own procurement procedures. Similarly, Lot 5
will be financed in parallel entirely by the CCCE, and the tenders open only
to French contractors. The tenders were opened in public on April 15, 1978;
24 contractors had submitted bids. Consultants BCEOM immediately evaluated
the tenders and issued a preliminary report on April 25 which showed that the
tenders were generally much lower (30%) than the estimates used in project
preparation. Several alternative methods of berth construction were submitted
and are being studied. Civil works will take about 23 months to complete
from the date of the contract award, with a 12-month guarantee period to
follow.
Supervision of Civil Works
3.29      The Government is in the process of appointing, on terms and condi-
tions acceptable to the Association and the other co-financers, a suitably
qualified firm of consultants to supervise the construction of all of the
civil works.
Studies of Coastal Protection Works
3.30      Following effectiveness of the proposed credit, a firm of consult-
ants will be selected and appointed in accordance with the Bank guidelines to
carry out a detailed study of the coastal protection works necessary. Terms
of reference for the study will be prepared by the Government with the assis-
tance of other interested Government agencies and the Association.
I.   Disbursements
3.31      Disbursements from the proposed credit will be made on the follow-
ing basis: For the civil works, the Association will finance $6.50 million
for part of Lot 1 and Lot 4 only, which represents, including some local
costs, 33% of the total cost of $19.84 million for these two items. For the
technical assistance items and studies, the Association will finance about 85%
of the total costs. The estimated schedule of disbursements from the credit
account is as follows:

J. Environmental Aspects
3.32      As a consequence of the port's construction, the marine conditions
at the seaward outlet of the Cotonou Lagoon changed considerably (map IBRD
13126). This lagoon acts as an overflow channel for Lake Nokoue and
during periods of heavy rainfall the lagoon had an outlet to the sea which
would close naturally as soon as the water level fell again and the sand
transport system closed the temporary outlet. With the construction of the
port, sand transport was blocked by the updrift port breakwater; for the first
time the mouth of the lagoon remained permanently open to the sea. This
resulted in serious ecological changes in the lagoon and, more important, in
Lake Nokoue.



- 23 -
3.33      The Government appointed consultants (financed by USAID) to study
the situation and design a barrage to be built across the lagoon to prevent
the ingress of the saline wedge and yet enable the excess waters of the lake
and lagoon to discharge when necessary. (Consultants' studies also included a
badly needed new road bridge across the Cotonou Lagoon.) The barrage has been
completed and the lake will begin to return to its original state. However,
the losses in terms of fishing employment and property damage have been
considerable.
3.34      Farther to the east, erosion continues for several kilometers and
considerable loss of land has taken place (map IBRD 1.3126). Some coast
protection works have been carried out since the port was built to control
shoreline erosion, notably the construction of a stone revetment to the west
bank at the seaward end of the lagoon and two groynes about 3.5 km east of the
port. The Government appointed Delft Laboratories, The Netherlands, to
carry out an independent study of the problem. Their final report was received
in April 1977 and the major comments and recommendations are summarized
below:
(a) The cut-off breakwater will prevent the bypassing
of sand for the next 10 years. After this maintenance
dredging will be necessary. 1/
(b) The beach immediately east and dowudrift of the lagoon
entrance owes its presenS stability to the fact that it
received about 300,000 m of sand per year from the lagoon.
However the recently completed barrage will prevent
this and erosion will begin to take place. A secondary
consequence of the barrage may be that, as a short-term
effect, the lagoon entrance will be blocketd by sand; but
in the long term, after erosion of the bar and the beach,
the barrage itself will be threatened by wave action, and
the construction of a new breakwater arm at the mouth of
the lagoon is proposed.
(c)  After project completion, erosion to the east of the port
will increase but this will be a consequence of the
barrage construction, which itself was a consequence of
the original port construction.
3.35      The results of this study have been discussed at length with the
Government, PAC, and USAID staff. The Government also requested comments
from the consulants BCEOM.
1/   Consultants BCEOM do not agree with this point, and a compromise period
has been used in the preparation of this report.



- 24 -
3.36      In view of the implications of the erosion problem and the high
costs of coastal protection works, it is proposed under this project to
finance an additional study which would:
(a) Propose alternative measures for coastal protection,
and compare the advantages and disadvantages of each
Eor cost and effectiveness.
(b) Prepare a detailed plan of action and program.
(c) Estimate costs of civil engineering works proposed.
The Government has agreed to appoint consultants or experts by March 31, 1979,
on terms and conditions acceptable to the Association, to carry out this
study, and to have completed the study by March 31, 1980.
K. The Railway System, OCBEN
3.37      The railway is essential to the Benin route.  Therefore, the opera-
tion of OCBN and the plans for improving the Cotonou-Parakou road parallel to
the railway line, which will result in road/rail transport competition, were
reviewed as part of the project preparation.
3.38      The factors limiting the capacity of the route Benin outside the
port are: (a) insufficient motive power and rolling stock of OCBN; (b)
inefficient cargo handling by the majority Government-owned forwarding com-
pany, Societe de Transit de Consignation du Benin (SOTRACOB) at the rail/road
transshipment point in Parakou; and (c) low freight rates paid the trucking
companies which transport cargo from Parakou to Niger; the low rates result in
lack of competition, low standards and poor maintenance of vehicles. So far
as (a) is concerned, OCBN's capacity is being increased by about 50% or
150,000 tons p.a. until 1980 to enable it to handle between 450,000 and
500,000 tons p.a. through a project of CCCE. The CCCE project includes
equipment for ballast production; 125 freight cars; motive power (4 loco-
motives, 4 railcars with 24 trailers, and 5 shunters); track maintenance
equipment; track material for 24 km of track; and a breakdown crane. The
Government will improve SOTRACOB operations item (b). Item (c) will be
studied under the proposed project.
3.39      To complement the CCCE project, the Government has agreed to prepare
by June 30, 1979 a plan of action, acceptable to the Association, covering
operations and cargo handling. The objective of the plan would be to improve
the average time for transshipment and to increase the capacity of the trans-
shipment facilities at the rail/road terminal at Parakou in accordance with
traffic demand. The Government has agreed to implement this plan, following
review by the Association, by December 31, 1980.

IV. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A.   General
4.01      The proposed project, part of the Benin's 1977-80 Economic Develop-
ment Plan, is given high priority by the Government. It has been designed
(i) to reduce handling and shipping costs and (ii) to stimulate transit traf-
fic of Niger and Nigeria. The project will help the Government to achieve its
objective of about 7% annual growth in GNP in real terms between 1980 and 1985
since Benin's leading sectors -- commerce, transport and modern industry--rely
largely on the development of transit traffic (paras. 1.14 and 1.15).
B. Traffic Analysis
Recent trends and future prospects
4.02      There has been an unprecedented increase in the general cargo
traffic handled at Cotonou Port during the last three years. This traffic
increased by 36,000 tons (11%) in 1975, 108,000 tons (25%) in 1976 and
156,000 tons (30%) in 1977, in contrast with an average growth of about
5% during the early 1970's. Total general cargo traffic, including cereals
and sulphur handled at the main quay, reached 689,000 tons in 1977 (383,000
tons in 1974). Clinker imports for the cement plant at Cotonou also registered
a significant increase (8.5% per annum) during the same period. Liquid bulk
traffic showed a more moderate increase; oil imports grew at 5% while bulk
vegetable oil exports (mainly palm oil), stabilized at about 30,000 tons (see
Table 1, Annex 2).
4.03      The major cause of the rapid growth of traffic is Nigerian imports
which transit (directly or indirectly through Benin,ese importers) via Cotonou.
As the port was initially designed to satisfy the demand of traditional
traffic of Benin and Niger, it is inadequate to handle all the potential
demand for transit traffic. The present congestion of the port and the
resulting freight rate surcharge of between 20% and 35% imposed on Cotonou
traffic have already caused significant diversion of Niger traffic to Lome
(60,000 tons in 1977) despite higher land access ccosts to the sea. Without
diversion of Niger imports to nei'hboring ports, tbhe growth of traditional
imports (Benin and Niger), throusgl` Cotonou would halve probably reached about
15% p.a. In addition, because o.1 the lack of bertbLing facilities, the port
had to limit Nigeria transit traffic (direct and indirect) to about 330,000
tons despite a potential demand of about 600,000 tons for direct transit.
4.04      The rapid development of this transit traffic combined with the
decline of Niger exports of groundnut products to Europe has accentuated
the dramatic imbalance between in-bound and out-bound traffic of general
cargo at the port. Exports now represent only 9% of general cargo traffic
as opposed to 36% in the early 1970's.

Basis for traffic projections
4.05      T'he Ministry of Transport commissioned BCEOM (France) in 1974 to
prepare a forecast of traffic through the port up to 1990 and a master plan
for the port. BCEOM and the appraisal mission updated the forecast in 1977
to take into account the higher-than-anticipated growth of Nigeria transit
traffic in the years 1975-77. Detailed forecasts by commodity group and
country are available in the project file.
(a) Traditional traffic (Benin, Niger)
4.06      Traffic forecasts of imports and exports were made for each major
commodity group on data collected from major industries and from the Govern-
ment. Due to the lack of data projections, estimates for some general cargo
items were made on the basis of growth factors used in the national account or
aggregate national foreign trade projections prepared by the Association. For
example, overall traffic forecasts for Benin have been adjusted to take into
account GDP and foreign trade growth through 1985; Niger's foreign trade
forecasts were mainly based on sectoral studies recently prepared by the
Government and BCEOM. The proposed forecasts of imports of intermediate and
consumer goods generated by the growth in uranium exports were cross-checked
with trends observed in Gabon, Ivory Coast and Nigeria which have registered
rapid growth in the value of exports.
4.07      The allocation of Niger foreign trade between routes through Benin
and Togo was based on a gravity model relating traffic to transportation costs
of major commodity groups. Empirical adjustments were then made in order to
take into account non-quantifiable elements such as a possible future improve-
ment of the port and inland transport system in Nigeria, and the willingness
of the Niger Government to maintain some diversification of its access
to the sea. The analysis shows that after the completion of the proposed
project and elimination of the present congestion, the port of Cotonou should
accommodate about 73% of Niger imports as against only 63% in 1977. In the
long run, however, this percentage could decline slightly as some imports for
eastern and southeastern Niger (about 30% of import traffic) might transit
through Nigeria by rail, if, as now planned by the Grande Commission Mixte
Niger-Nigeria, the Nigerian railway line is extended 130 km northwards to
Maradi in southern Niger, or if containerisation by road becomes a more
practicable operation.
(b) Upper Volta and Mali
4.08      This traffic is negligible.  It has been estimated at 5,000 tons in
1985 and 10,000 tons in 1990.
(c) Nigeria transit traffic
4.09      Forecasts for this traffic are tentative and largely depend on
(i) relationship between Nigeria and Benin, (ii) retention of some features
of an open market system in Benin, (iii) improvement in operations of Nigerian
ports, and (iv) the future growth of Nigerian imports.



27 -
4.10      It is likely that in the medium and even long term, significant
Nigeria import traffic will continue to transit through Cotonou, as evidenced
by the willingness of the Nigerian Trust Fund to participate in financing the
project. Benin intends to continue its policy of creating joint venture
industrial and commercial projects to supply the Nigerian market from Benin.
Since 1975, Nigerian policy has been to work more closely with neighboring
countries, mainly Benin, to develop regional projects, e.g. the Cotonou and
Onigbolo cement plants, Save sugar plant complex, food industries, and con-
struction of new "interstate transversal roads." The Lagos-Seme expressway,
financed by Nigeria, was comple'ted in 1977 and the port of Cotonou now has
dirert access to Western Nigeria and to the new :Lndustrial areas near Lagos
which are about 120 km from Cotonou.
4.11      The economic evaluation of the project has been based on a possible
Nigerian transit traffic of about 300,000 tons, i.e., a figure half-way be-
tween the present traffic demand by Nigerian importers (about 600,000 tons)
and the most pessimistic case which assumes a complete disappearance of the
traffic. On the basis of recent trends, it is assumed that about 50% of
traffic (150,000 tons) will be direct transit. This will represent about
1.5% of the total break-bulk cargo traffic expected to be handled at Lagos in
1983/84 and possibly 5 to 6% of break-bulk cargo imports destined for Western
Nigeria.
Traffic projections
4.12      Traffic projections by commodity group and country are presented
in Table 2, Annex 2. The estimates project an increase in general cargo
traffic of about 42% by 1981 (689,000 tons in 1977 and 978,000 tons in 1981).
Most of the increase will occur immediately after completion of the proposed
proiject, as an expected 420,000 tons (326,000 tons in 1977) of Nigerian
imports will transit through Cotonou even with increased capacity and improve-
ments in Lagos port.
4.13      After the early 1980/81 increase immediately after completion of
the project, traffic should stabilize until 1986, assuming, (i) the situation
in Nigerian ports significantly improves and Nigeria transit traffic declines
to about 320,000 tons, and (ii) some Nigerian ports might start to compete
with Cotonou for transit traffic for eastern Niger if rail transportation in
Nigeria improves. After 1985, traffic growth will be provided only by tradi-
tional traffic (Benin and Niger), mainly import:s.

*C.  Proect Benefits
4.15      Prolects benefits can be grouped under three headings corresponding
to the three major components of the project:
(a)  d;redging savings and new land creation resulting from
the dredging of a siltation trap at the entrance of
the port and the construction of the cut-off breakwater;
(b)  freight savings for clinker imports resulting from deepening
the access channel to the port to accommodate larger ships;
(c)  savings from the extension of the main quay: savings in ship
waiting time and service time, reduction of handling
cost, reduction of land access cost to the sea for Niger,
and benefits accruing to Benin port and transport operators
from avoidance of traffic diversion.



- 29 
4.16      The economic rate of return of the project has been calculated by
comparing the cost of the proposed investment wiLth the benefits which will
accrue to "captive traffic", i.e. traffic in the "without" case.  However,
this is not a "do nothing" solution, because even without the project,
congestion will force the PAC and OBEMAP to improve port operations.
Benefits from the Extension of the main guay
(a) Ship waiting time savings
4.17      In 1977 the total- -Rting time of the 460 ships which called at
Cotorou to load or unload general cargo was 83,000 hours, an average of
about: 180 hours per ship. The cost was about US$19 million for the year,
based on an average cost of ship in port estimates of $180 per hour for
tramp vessels and chartered ships (40% of traffic) and $250 per hour for
liners (60% of traffic). Since ship waiting time is twice the total ship
service time, the shipping conferences having applied a freight surcharge of
35% on ships calling at Cotonou, As a result, some companies divert an
inc:reasing proportion of Niger traffic to Lome. The ship waiting time savings
from the extension of the berthing facilities Elre based on results provided by
a port simulation model.  These estimates assume that (i) the present sea-
sonality of traffic will continue and about 41% of break-bulk cargo traffic
will be handled during the four peak months; (ii) a maximum of about 150,000
tons per year of general cargo will continue to be handled at the eastern
breakwater in the without case despite high hanidling costs; and (iii) these
benefits will be shared between Benin, Niger and Nigeria in proportion to the
traffic in the without case. From the analysis of the recent situation at
Cotonou and surveys conducted among shipping companies, it is estimated that
diversion of Niger transit traffic to Lome will occur when ship waiting time
exceeds about two days on annual basis (4 to 5 days during peak period of
traffic), i.e. when the cost of waiting time in Cotonou is approximately equal
to the additional land transport cost of cargo destined to the Niamey region.
4.18      For charter and tramp vessels, which are competitive along the West
African coast, freight rates are sensitive to port conditions and the major
part of ship waiting time savings (about 78%) for this traffic will be passed
to the country through improved voyage and time rates. it has been estimated
from surveys undertaken by consultants that only 53% of liner time saving
will pass to Benin, Niger or Nigeria through freight rate adjustments.  This
estimate takes into account the various shipping conditions (CIF or FOB)
applied to import or export traffic.
4.19      Total benefits from reduction oI sn'bp waiting time can be summariced
as follow:

(b) Ship service time savings
4.19      The shortage of storage areas within the confines of the port is a
major cause of the decline of the productivity. Considerable delays occur
in finding storage space for goods, for reorganizing cargo or for moving
goods in the port. The proposed extension of the main quays will provide
additional storage areas behind the new berths and will eliminate the shortage
of space behind the existing berths. In addition, the proposed technical
assistance will permit PAC and OBEMAP to implement better working methods
and improve supervision and control over labor. These benefits and underlying
assumptions are summarized below:

(c) Handling and storage cost savings
4.21      Shore congestion increases handling cost, and specific operational
improvements are expected from the proposed extens-Lon of the port and techni-
cal assistance program such as (i) improved turnaround time of goods in the
stacking yards; (ii) better utilization of handling equipment and labor;
and (iii) reduction of the use of the Eastern jetty where handling costs are
40% higher than on the main quay. These improvements will reduce by about
18%--CFAF 300/ton--the costs for handling and storage of break-bulk cargo at
the main quay and by about CFAF 1,200 for the avoidance of the use of the
eastern jetty. These cost savings will benefit Benin, Niger and Nigeria in
proportion to traffic in the without case. Part of these savings (about 30%
for on-board operations) will accrue to ship owners.

(d)  Benefits for Benin from avoidance of trLffic diversion
4.22      Without the project Cotonou port will not be able to handle all
estimated potential traffic; the result will be that part of that traffic
for Niger will be diverted to Lome. In addition, western Nigerian importers
will cease using Cotonou if conditions in the Nigerian ports, mainly Lagos,
improve but Cotonou remains congested. From a survey of regional ports,
it appears that the best criteria to use for defining capacity of the port
of Cotonou and the volume of potential traffic likely to be diverted to other
ports in the "without" case is ship waiting time. A waiting-time limit equal
to about 40% of service time can be used as a normal indicator. This ratio
has been applied after 1983; before then, a higher ratio has been applied:
70% i- 1980, 60% in 1981 and 50% in 1982 as the ratio is expected to decrease
when the situation of the neighboring ports improves.
4.23      The following table shows the volume of potential transit traffic
which will be diverted to other ports in the without case. It is assumed that
Benin will give priority to the traditional Niger traffic at the expense of
NigeriLan traffic.

4.24      The diversion of transit traffic to other ports v-ill cause the
Government of Benin to lose significant revenues since most of tlhe port and
transport operators in Cotonou port are Beninese who must tranwsfer the major
part of their profits to the Government.  A comprehensive survey and analysis
of accounts of each corporation involved in the port and tran sport system was
made by consultants in order to estimate the benefits which wil1l accrue to
the various operators and the losses to Niger resulting from th.e use of the
more expensive Togolese route. Benefits for Benin include the real profits
of the corporations, taxes to Benin and additional wages paid to unskilled
local labor0  Shadow pricing of labor has been applied when necessary.  As
indicated below the economic benefit per ton for Benin is important. Tlhese
benefits, which include additional PAC revenues from proposed tariff increases,
range from CFAF 4,953 per ton (US$20.20) for Nigeria tra. ffc to CFAF 64164
(US$25.20) for Niger traffic.

(e) Transport cost savings for Niger
4.25      Niger will also benefit from the project since it will permit Niger
to avoid diversion of traffic on the Togolese route where land transportation
costs are, as indicated below, considerably higher than on the Benin route
particularly for central and south-eastern Niger.

at a cost of about CFAF 330/m and mobilization cost of about CFAF 60 million

1979 to CFAF 278 million at the end of the 1990's (see table 3a in the Annex).
Benefits from dredging savings have been allocated proportionately between
Benin, Niger and Nigeria according to the total traffic of these three countries
in the without case, as without the proposed works, PAC would probably charge
port users to recover maintenance dredging costs.
4.28      Creation of additional land.  The shortage of land for storing and
stacking goods is a maaor cause of port congestion and decline in productivity
of shore-handling operations. Without the cut-off breakwater, the extension
of berthing facilities will remain limited to th.e northern face of the basin
and the land available for shore handling operations and storage will be
limited to a narrow stretch of land enclosed between the basin and the Boulevard
de France (see map IBRD 13127).  Construction of the breakwater will permit
the accretion of sand to create ne- land, nllowing the use of the southern
face of the basin when needed. It is estimated that about 50 ha of new land
will be available by 1991.  Wzit  the price of undeveloped land in the port
area assumed to be CFAF 3,500/m4, PAC estimated the total value of the new
land created during the 1980/91 period will amount to at least CFAF 1.8
billion (US$7.3 miliion), i.e. about CFAF 150 mill-on per annum.
Freight Saviigs  clinc mL_ imoDorts)
4.29      The deepening of the access channel will permit larger clinker
carriers to be accommodated--42,000 dwt instead of a maximum of 39,000 dwt
now--and with an increase in the average cargo from 29,000 to 33,000 tons.
Benin will benefit throtugh a reduction of freight rates of about CFAF 185/ton
(US$.76). Assuming that only two-thirds of clinker imports (400,000 tons
p.a.) will be carried by the 42,000 dwt -hips category, savings on clinker
freight will be about CFAF 50 mil'lion.
Total piLoiect benefI ts
4.30      Total quantified benefit streams attributable to the project adopted
for calculating the economic return are given in Table 3 of the Annex.
Benefits corresponding to the t"best estimate" of traffic can be summarized as
follows:

Other, non-qualified benefits
4.31      The scope for potential benefits is greater than outlined above.
The deve:Lopment of transit traffic to Nigeria will permit a basic expansion
of services and industries associated with this traffic. Quantification
of such benefits would require parallel assumptions with respect to the
additional capital investment needed which are beyond the scope of the
analysis. Finally there are other benefits which do not lend themselves
to reliable quantification on the basis of available information but which,
nevertheLess, are important: improved handling operations, more rapid
delivery of goods, and improved qualificatons of labor from the general
development of the transport sector.
Project costs
4.32      The detailed project cost streams (1978 prices) used for the
economic evaluation are presented in tables 3a and 3b of the Annex. These
costs exclude customs duties, local taxes and price contingencies. They
include (i) civil works and supervision; (ii) after 1981, PAC capital expenses
for routine and periodic maintenance for 25 years; aLnd (iii) technical assis-
tance and training, as benefits from improved port productivity have been
quantified in the project benefit streams. Costs whLich will occur during
project implementation period (i.e. excluding maintenance) are as follows:

ECONOMIC RETURN
4.33      The project as a whole and for all users, i.e. foreign ship owners,
Benin, Niger and NiSaria, will yield an excellent economic return of 37% for
the best estimate of traffic and costs and a first year benefit (FYB) of 29%.
4.34      The economic return for Benin alone will be about 25% with a FYB
of about 22% assuming the proposed PAC tariff increases materialize (see paras.
5.10 and 5.11). This return is considered excellent, taking into account that
the project will help develop local activities such as storing, repacking or
reprocessing goods re-exported to neighboring countries.
4.35      The economic return of the project at the overall regional level,
including Togo, will be 19% (FYB, 13%). This excludes the benefits accruing
to port operators in case of diversion of Niger traffic to the Togolese route
since these benefits would accrue to Lome port operators instead of Cotonou
(para. 4.26).
4.36      The high return expected from the project can be explained by the
following:
(i) The bids tendered by contractors for the civil works
were low, which is possibly related to a temporary
decline in development projects in Nigeria.
(ii)  Under the "best traffic estimate", it is expected that
important, additional transit traffic for Nigeria will
be diverted to Cotonou immediately after the completion
of the project as some port and urban congestion might
continue at Lagos at least until 1983/84.
(iii) Port and transit operations are very profitable, and
since most port, transit and transport operators
have been nationalized, most of these benefits will
accrue to Benin Government budget.
(iv)  The project will permit Niger to reduce considerably
(at least US$7 million per annum) its land transportation
costs on foreign trade as the Benin route is the shortest
link to the sea for West and Central Niger.
D. Project Risks
4.37      Tests of the sensitivity of the economic return of the project as a
whole and for each item to changes in capital costs, maintenance cost, traffic
and benefits were carried out. The results (Table 4, Annex 2) indicate that
for the traffic best estimate projection, even with a combined 15% increase in
costs and a 20% decrease in benefits (cost savings/ton, tariff, ship time
costs, etc.), the overall return of the project for all users would be very
good -- (27x). Under the same assumptions, the economic return for Benin
alone would still yield an acceptable 17% IRR.



- 37 -
4.38      Sensitivity tests have also been carried out in the most unfavorable
event that Nigeria's direct transit traffic using Cotonou disappears. In this
case the overall economic return for all users is only 25% (FYB 10%) and the
return for Benin alone falls to 13%, which still remains acceptable. However,
the FYB will be only 4%. This reflects a risk of about 25% over-capacity
in the proposed berth extension project until the mid 1980's.  But considering
the traffic congestion at Lagos, the participation of the Nigerian Trust Fund
in the financing of the proposed project and the willingness of Nigeria to
implement regional projects in Benin and to use Cotonou port facilities, this
traffic is not likely to disappear.
4.39      The Government will discuss with the Bank in mid-1978 its investment
program in the transport sector scheduled for the 1978-81 economic development
plan, and specify its sectoral objectives for the next planning period. The
Government should also keep the Bank informed of any new agreements regarding
the future development of the transit traffic.

5.02      The costs of the old port works, completed in 1965, totalled about
CFAF 8 billion, CFAF 7 billion for infrastructure and CFAF 1 billion for
superstructure. However, as PAC does not account for land and assets financed
from subsidies, the above balance sheets do not incorporate the net book value
of these old port works. Capital expenditure for additional assets is shown
in the above balance sheets and has been financed through borrowing, prin-
cipally from the Benin Development Bank, or from PAC's own resources. All the
fixed assets in use shown in the audited balance sheets represent depreciable
assets including paved roads, etc.   The Government agreed that PAC would
incorporate into its accounts for the year ending December 31, 1979, based on
a physical inventory, the value of all fixed assets which are in use and are
not in the existing accounts. The question of asset valuation is dealt with
later in this report (para. 5.12).
5.03      Among the current assets, receivables showed a marked increase from
CFAF 164 million at the end of 1974 to about CFAF 365 million as of December
31, 1976 (40% and 53% of gross operating revenue, respectively), while cash
also increased appreciably during the same period. Substantial recoveries of
outstandings were made in 1977. The Government agreed that PAC would reduce
the balance of PAC's receivables by December 31, 1979 to about two months'
average gross operating revenue, or not more than 20% of gross revenue, and to
introduce, if necessary, deterrents such as recovery of advance deposits from
users.
5.04      PAC's audited income accounts for the last three fiscal years
(Table 6, Ainex 2), are misleading because most assets and the corresponding
depreciation are not accounted for. If, based on BCEOM's estimates, the
requisite adjustments were made for the non-accounted assets but without
revaluation at replacement costs, the following picture would emerge showing a
weak but improving position:
1974      1975       1976

- 39 -
5.05      Of the operating revenue, charges on goods constitute the largest
item (40%), followed by rents (31%) and levies on vessels (29%). The increase
in revenue is due to the revision of tariffs in 1974 and increase in traffic,
particularly in 1976. The largest element of the working expenses is staff
costs (63%), the other important item being works, materials and supplies
(24%). Staff costs increased by 50% during the period due to additional staff
and wage increases. However, the proposed technical assistance is expected to
achieve administrative efficiency and better utiliz;ation of staff. The ratios
have improved generally with the proportionately larger increase in operating
revenue than in expenditure and consequently better net operating revenue.
The negative results are due to taking into account depreciarion on tne
previously omitted assets, and these would have been considerably worse if
revaluation of the fixed assets had been done. Because of the net operating
deficit for 1974 and the negligible net revenue for 1975, no return is earned
on the net fixed assets in those years, while the return on an estimated net
asset base of CFAF 7.5 billion for 1976 is low.
OBEMAP
5.06      OBEMAP's original capital has remained unchanged at the statutory
level of CFAF 50 million but it can be altered by the Government if proposed
by its board. OBEMAP has also received some loans from the Government.
OBEMAP's financial contributions to the Government have been quite substan-
tial. Its gross revenue collections are subject to a turnover tax (about
19%); iL has paid income tax since 1974/75 at the rate of 40%; and its net
surplus after the statutory transfer (at present 10%) to reserves is handed
over to the Government. In total, the Government receives, therefore, 94% of
the surplus before tax. The magnitude of the contributions can be gauged
from OBEMAP's financial data cited in para. 5.07.

the last three years:

5.08      Charges for handling cargo on shore are higher than those for
handling cargo on board vessels.  Tariff revisions in 1974 and increases
in traffic account for the higher revenues. Staff costs represent about 60%
of the operating expenditure and have been mounting. However, the position
is expected to improve with the operational and organizational reforms the
proposed technical assistance should bring about. The financial return on
average net fixed assets is substantial because of high tariffs, the low



- 41 -
asset base and its valuation at historical costs. If the financial return
(after tax) is computed on average capital employed, i.e. average net fixed
assets Ln use and net current assets, it would still be substantial, ranging
from 35% in 1973/74 to 28% in 1975/76. A separate annual provision is usually
made for major renewals and replacements by way of an appropriation from the
net operating rtvenue; the total as of June 30, 1976 was CFAF 100.3 million.
B. Future Financial Performance of PAC
Income Accounts
5.09      PAC's hitherto small cash generation from operations shows that only
a small share of past capital investment has been recovered by PAC from its
users. For this reason, PAC is not now in a position to make a substantial
contribution toward financing the proposed project from accumulated cash and
current cash generation. There is, however, considerable scope for changing
this unfortunate situation now and in future years through improving the
efficiency of operations and, more importantly, through periodic port tariff
increases on an expanding volume of cargo.
5.10      The timing and extent of tariff increases must be determined under
several aspects: substantial benefits will accrue to port users from planned
port investment, and a significant part of these benefits can be recaptured
directly for PAC through tariff increases.  Specifically, the purchase of port
equipment in 1978 will benefit users through improved port productivity and
shorter ship waiting and service times. Port tariffs should increase by an
average of 30% by June 1979. This would allow cost inflation to be offset for
1978 and 1979, expected to run during the forecast period at an annual rate of
6%, and to generate annually additional revenue in real terms of about 15%.
During the subsequent period of about 18 months until completion of the
project, tariff increases should be only moderately in excess of inflationary
cost increases to avoid the risk of traffic diversion. An annual rate of
tariff increase of 10% appears adequate for this purpose.
5.11      At completion of the project in late 1980, the competitive position
of Cotonou, compared to other ports will improve substantially, in particular
if, as expected, the present congestion surcharge for Cotonou is abolished as
the new berths come into use and ship waiting time is reduced. The exact
scope for tariff increases, in any event considerable, will largely depend on
the competitive situation of Cotonou at that time with regard to the efficiency
and reliability of port services and inland transport, the available capacity
of neighboring ports, the preference of shipping lines and total transport
costs for using different ports and transport corridors. The traffic analysis
(see Chaper IV) indicates that Nigeria traffic is less sensitive to port
tariffs than transit traffic for Niger, where a risk of diversion to Lome
exists.. Since traffic diversion from Cotonou would entail high economic costs
for Benin (cf. para. 4.36), the 1981 tariff increases must be carefully
assessed and prepared with the assistance of PAC's consultants. The



- 42 -
present estimate is that no traffic will be diverted from Cotonou if PAC's
tariff increases at completion of the project are limited to $5/ton of general
cargo and $1/ton of oils and clinker (for which benefits from the project are
much smaller), corresponding to an average increase of about 75% of the 1980
tariffs, and if OBEMAP's tariff increases will be limited essentially to
offset inflation. The latter would also apply to PAC after 1981, when 10%
annual increases have been assumed. Since shipping lines are highly sensitive
to charges to be borne by them in selecting their ports of call, most of the
higher charges must be borne by the landed cargo, subject, however, to the
findings of the costing study.
5.12      Since PAC is and will remain a very capital intensive undertaking,
a yardstick to adequately measure its financial performance must take into
account the replacement value of assets. The Government agreed that PAC would
do the following: (i) revalue its assets by December 31, 1979 and thereafter
at appropriate intervals determined as a function of inflation rates, but in
no case exceeding five years; and (ii) achieve a minimum financial rate of
return before income tax (para. 5.15).
5.13      PAC's forecast income accounts and other financial forecasts, shown
below, are in addition, based on the following assumptions:
1.   Estimates for 1977 take into account the available
actuals for part of the year and budget figures.
2.   Operating revenue projections from 1978 onwards
have been computed in proportion to the annual
growth in traffic and the above tariff increases,
an increase of 5% p.a. being allowed for miscel-
laneous receipts.
3.   Operating expenditure forecasts generally allow for
an increase of 10% p.a.: 6% for inflation and 4% for
expansion in activity following traffic growth
with variations where applicable to allow for the
impact of better organization and operations following
technical assistance. Non-operating expenses mainly
represent interest charges including those on the
increased debt for the project. The grants portion
of the project financing has been treated as the govern-
ment's equity contribution to PAC (para. 5.17 below).
4.   The estimated cost of the new project facilities debit-
able to PAC (CFAF 10.9 billion, US$44.4 million) has been
taken into consideration in projecting the cash flow and
fixed assets. A nominal yearly amount has been assumed
for non-project or ordinary capital expenditure. All
project related fixed assets would be capitalized after
completion and commissioning, i.e., in 1981.



- 43 -
5.   Net debit or credit for old structures demolished or re-
constructed in project execution, after allowing for the
cost of any usable materials salvaged, would be taken
in the project. Scrap value of other assets to be
demolished during project construction has been assumed
to be insignificantD
6.   Depreciation has been calculated on the estimated cost
of project fixed assets other than land by the straight-
line method and according to their estimated lives based on
broad categories. The existing assets, incliiding those
omitted from PAG's accounts, have been revalued for 1979 and
depreciation provided according to the estimates of consultants
BCEOM. The impact of a revaluation of the fixed assets in 1984
has been separately estimated and incorporated into the tables.
Expenditures on technical assistance and training are capitalized
and amortized as intangible assets over ten years.
7.   The entire project cost, debitable to PAC, will be financed
by the relative contributions as shown in the financing plan.
5.14      On the basis of the foregoing assumptions, the summary forecasts of
revenue and expenditure accounts are the following (Table 7, Annex 2):

5.15      The proposed tariLff increases, aggregated over the 1978-1984
period, amount to about 110% in real terms. This may prima facie appear
excessive, but it is feasible in the particular case of PAC, due to the
large cost advantage of Cotonou and the Benlr. oute vis-a-vis neighboring
ports (para. 4.24) and Justified by the need to quickly recover a sub-
stantiaL part of port investment. Moreover, the proposed tariff increases
represent only about 2.5% of the total transport cost from Western Europe
to Niger estimated at about $300/ton for general cargo.  The Government agreed
that PAC would achieve a minimum rate of return before income tax on net fixed
assets in use, as revalued from time to time, of 5% in 1980 and 8% thereafter.
5.16      PAC's future cash needs will essentially consist of debt service
requirelaents, since no major investment outside the project is planned.  Thus,
the bulk of PAC's cash generation will be t-ransferred to the Government
through existing mechanisms, which are adequate. This leaves PAC sufficient
cash to service its debt and cover its current needs.
Balance Sheets and Cash Flow (Tables 8 and 9, Annex 2)
5.17      To create a reasonable structure in PAC's balance sheet, project
financing takes the form partly of equity and partly of long-term debt. CFAF
2.8 billion of project financing will be in the form of grants to Benin and
CFAF 7.7 billion in form of loans or cred'iis- The probable terms for the
loans will be: Abu Dhabi and BADEA loans to the Government--20 years in-
cluding 4 years' grace with interest at 4?. and 6% p.a., respectively; CCCE
loan to PAC--15 years including 3 years' grace with interest at 6.5% (includ-
ing commission); and AfDB (NTF1 loan to PAC--25 years including 5 years' grace
with interest at 4% (Tdble i0  Annex    'The co-financers appear to want to
make their funds available to PAG on .the sane conditions they are being given
to the Government.  Tnis would result in a reasonable debt/equity structure
for PAC. However, due to the concessiona' conditions of certain loans, the
resulting debt service for PAC would be somewhat light. It was agreed,
therefore, that the the part of IDA funds directly benefitting PAC, US$9.70
million, will be onlent to PAC by tie Governinent at 7.5% interest for a period
of 20 years, including 5 years of grace. The conclusion of an onlending
agreement between the Government and PAC is a condition of effectiveness of
the proposed credit. The grant from Norway will also be onlent to PAC by the
Government on the same terms as the IDA funds.
5.18      The following financing forecast for the project period (1978-81)
shows that PAC's contribution toward financing the project will be relatively
small. This forecast and the following one regarding balance sheets assume
cash transfer from PAC to the Gover-nment of most of PAC's net surplus.

5.19      The following is a summary of the projected balance sheets:
as of December 31                  1979       1981      1984
Net Fixed Assets in Use           15,460    24,751   32,000
Work-in-Progress                   3,558        -         -
Total Net Fixed Assets            19,018    24,751   32,000
Net Intangible Assets                295        278       161
Net Current Assets                 1,274    .2,795    6,697
Total Net Assets                  20,587    27,824   38,858

Debt/Equity Ratio                14/86       29/71    19/81
5.20      The value of the net fixed assets at historical costs, including
those omitted from the accounts will approximately double in 1979 on revalua-
tion. The value will rise again substantially when there is another assumed
evaluation in 1984. The main reason for the increase in current assets, and
consequently in the ratio of current assets to current liabilities, is the
accumulation of cash representing chiefly the provision for depreciation. The
increase will be curtailed from 1984 onward with the end of grace periods and
much higher debt service payments. The debt/equity ratio is acceptable, but
the Government agreed that PAC would not incur non-project capital expenditure
exceeding CFAF 100 million per year until December 31, 1985 except in agree-
ment with the Association.
C. Increase in Net Government Revenues from the Project
5.21      Although the port sub-sector alone accounts for only about 2.3% of
Benin's GDP, it makes a significant contribution to public revenues in the
form of direct and indirect taxes and fees. Therefore the sub-sector is
quite important to the Government. The proposed project will directly
contribute substantially to increase Government revenues as estimated below.

The table shows that over the period 1981-84 the government is likely to earn
significant gross additional revenues of about CFAF 8.7 billion (US$35 million
equivalent) from the development of the activities of' Cotonou port and trans-
port operators, who since their recent nationalization have to transfer most
of their benefits to the government. These can be expected to increase
further until the full capacity of the extended port is reached.
VI. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
6.01      Agreement has been reached with the Governmnent on the following
principal. items:
(i)  that the Government will:
(a)  ensure that productivity of the general cargo handling
operations within the port will be increased from the
present 7.1 tons per gang/hour to a minimum 10.0 tons
per gang/hour within six months after the civil works
included in the project become fully operational
(para 2.19).
(b)  appoint the necessary consultants or experts, on terms
and conditions acceptable to the Association, to assist
PAC, OBEMAP and OCBN and ensure appropriate implementation
of the recommendations made by them (paras. 3.17, 3.18
and 3.20);
(c)  second suitably qualified engineer employees to the staff
of the consultants in charge of supervising the civil
works and a Beninese counterpart to the project coordinator,
all of whom must be acceptable to the Association (para. 3.27);
(d)  appoint consultants or experts by March 31, 1979, on terms
and conditions acceptable to the Association, to study the
coastal protection study and to complete the study by
March 31, 1980 (para. 3.36); and



- 48 -
(e) prepare by June 30, 1979 a plan of action, acceptable to
the Association, to improve the average time of trans-
shipment and to increase the capacity of the transship-
ment-facilities at the rail/road terminal at Parakou
in accordance with traffic demand and to implement the
plan, following review by the Association, by December 31,
1980 (para. 3.39).
(iii)  that the Government assures that PAC will:
(a) have its accounts audited by qualified independent
auditors in accordance with appropriate auditing
principles (para. 2.29);
(b) maintain adequate insurance coverage for all struc-
tures, machinery and equipment, allowing for regular
revaluation of existing assets and assets to be con-
structed or acquired under the proposed project
(para. 2.30);
(c) incorporate in its accounts by December 31, 1979 based
on a physical inventory the value of all fixed assets
in use, and revalue such assets at replacement costs
by December 31, 1979 and thereafter at appropriate
intervals not exceeding 5 years (paras. 5.02 and 5.12);
(d) reduce its receivables to 20% of annual gross operating
revenue by December 31, 1979, and take adequate measures,
including, if necessary, the introduction of a system of
advance deposits, to restrict its receivables (para. 5.03);
(e) take necessary measures, including tariff increases,
to achieve a minimum rate of return before income tax
on average net fixed assets in use, as revalued from time
to time, of 5% in 1980 and 8% thereafter (para. 5.15); and
(f) not incur non-project capital expenditure exceeding
CFAF 100 million per year until December 31, 1985, except
in agreement with the Association (para. 5.20).
6.02      The effectiveness of the proposed credit would be subject to:
(a) the effectiveness of the BADEA and AfDB loan agreements, the
CIDA, FAC and Norway grant agreements, and the authorization
of the Abu Dhabi and CCCE loans by these two institutions
(para. 3.24);
(b) appointment, on terms and conditions acceptable to the Associa-
tion, of qualified engineering consultants to supervise con-
struction of civil works and a full-time project coordinator
(para. 3.27); and



- 49 -
(c) conclusion of an onlending agreement for US$9.70 million
equivalent of the proposed IDA credit between the Government
and PAC, on terms and conditions spelled out in para. 5.17.
6.03      The proposed project is suitable for a credit to the Government of
Benin in the amount of US$11 million on standard IDA terms, of which US$9.70
million will be on-lent to PAC on the same terms as a conventional Bank loan,
i.e. 20 years including a 5-year grace period at an interest rate of 7.50%.
