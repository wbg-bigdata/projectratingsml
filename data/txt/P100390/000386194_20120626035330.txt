F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The project development objective (PDO) is to support the integration of IDPs in
Puttalam by upgrading and improving their habitat, water and sanitation facilities of both
IDPs and select non-IDPs, and providing eligible IDPs in refugee camps with housing.

  The proposed PHP would achieve its objective by supporting the construction of 5,653
new houses to replace the temporary thatched huts, and the completion of 1493 partly-
completed houses in Puttalam. It also would provide drinking water to 13,584 IDP
families and 3,291 non IDP families. These interventions would help to upgrade habitat
and contribute to the socio-economic integration of IDPs and non-IDPs.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
The PDO was revised in November 2009. The revised PDO is "to support the integration
of IDPs in Puttalam by upgrading and improving the habitat, water and sanitation
facilities of both IDPs and select non-IDPs, and providing eligible IDPs in refugee camps
and a limited number of non-IDPs in the host communities with housing."

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

The 26 year civil conflict in Sri Lanka led to a loss of lives, displacement of persons
belonging to all ethnic groups, and destruction of infrastructure. Approximately 2.5
million persons lived in areas of direct military activity. Up to 700,000 left the country
while 613,220 individuals (160,754 families) remained internally displaced as of June,
2002. More than 170,000 Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) lived in refugee camps
that year. 1

While many IDPs had returned to their places of origin since 2002, 68,000 individuals
(18,000 families) remained in refugee camps in Sri Lanka in December, 2005. 2 The
sharp escalation of violence since January, 2006 led to renewed displacement with
235,000 new IDPs in Sri Lanka. The majority of the earlier IDPs were housed in the
district of Puttalam in the North West of Sri Lanka where 63,145 persons (or 15,480
families) lived in 141 refugee camps in 2006. Of these, 41 percent were children under
the age of 18 who have known no other home than the one in Puttalam. According to
estimates from a census supervised by the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR) in 2006, 96 percent of the IDPs in Puttalam indicated that they
intended to settle there and would not return to the North of Sri Lanka due to security
considerations. About 74 percent bought land in Puttalam, thus demonstrating a resolve
to remain there.

The IDPs in Puttalam were living in dire conditions with poor housing and a lack of safe
drinking water and sanitation. Among the IDPs in Puttalam displaced in 1990, 5,653
families lived in temporary thatched houses, 1493 families lived in partly-completed
houses, and 1,093 families lived in permanent houses. Another 6,501 families, who were
largely the married children of the original IDPs, had no house of their own and lived
with their extended families. To address the housing needs of the Puttalam IDPs, it
would be necessary to construct 12,154 new houses and complete 1493 partially
constructed units.

In the 111 refugee camps surveyed under the initial Social Assessment (SA), respondents
from 86 camps listed housing as their highest priority; respondents from 13 camps listed
it as the second highest priority. In June 2005, IDA responded to the Government of Sri
Lanka (GoSL)’s request for a Putalam Housing Project (PHP) to address the critical
housing, drinking water, sanitation, and environmental needs of the IDPs. 3 The PHP was
consistent with the GoSL’s strategy to meet the development needs of IDPs by


1
  Most of the IDPs were Muslims who had fled the civil conflict in the then occupied northern areas of Sri Lanka.
2
  The common term used in Sri Lanka to refer to refugee camps is welfare center.
3
  Concurrently, the GoSL with IDA’s support had embarked on a similar project, the North East Housing
Reconstruction Project (NEHRP), for the Northern and Eastern Provinces in Sri Lanka. The IDPs could not be covered
under NEHRP for two reasons: NEHRP specifically covered the Northern and Eastern Provinces and second, NEHRP
comprised reconstruction and resettlement of IDPs in their place of origin.




                                                       1
encouraging them to return to their original homes, where possible, and to otherwise
integrate them with the host non-IDP population in their preferred new location. The
PHP would rebuild the lives of those IDPs who had not been covered by earlier projects,
enhance their stability through housing, regularize land titles, provide safe drinking water,
and improve sanitation.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

The objective of the PHP was to support the integration of IDPs in Puttalam by upgrading
and improving their habitat, water and sanitation facilities of both IDPs and select non-
IDPs, and providing eligible IDPs in refugee camps with housing.

The Key Performance Indicators (KPI) to measure achievement of the project’s
development objective were: (i) number of housing units constructed and occupied within
specified time and allocated budget; the original target values were 7,885 houses (ii)
number of families provided with safe drinking water; the original target was 13,584 IDP
families and (iii) number of settlement plans designed and implemented. In each IDP one
settlement plan would be prepared.


1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification

Following restructuring, the PDO was modified. The new PDO was “to support the
integration of IDPs in Puttalam by upgrading and improving the habitat, water, and
sanitation facilities of both IDPs and select non-IDPs, and providing eligible IDPs in
refugee camps and a limited number of non-IDPs in the host communities with housing.?
The restructuring was not expected to alter the outcomes of the project; however, they
implied an addition to the KPI. The additional performance indicator was: number of
housing units constructed and occupied by the IDP and non-IDP households within a
specified time and allocated budget.

The project restructuring 4 was undertaken at the request of the Ministry of Resettlement
(MOR) to address two critical objectives. The first was to expand the provision of
housing from the originally planned permanent housing, to selected IDPs in the refugee
camps as well as to a limited number of the poorest non-IDPs households in adjacent
communities across four divisions in Puttalam district. The change was intended to
facilitate social cohesion and integration between IDP and non-IDP communities served
under the PHP by addressing the housing needs of a group of the poorest non-IDPs
households. The second objective was to expand the basis for selection of IDP
beneficiaries for a housing cash grant beyond the list of original eligible beneficiaries
identified by the UNHCR survey and the SA carried out in 2006.




4
    The project restructuring was approved by the Board of Executive Directors in November 2009.




                                                          2
1.4 Main Beneficiaries

The main beneficiaries were IDPs in the Puttalam district in the North West of Sri Lanka.
An estimated 63,145 persons (or 15,480 families) living in 141 refugee camps in 2006
were initially among the main beneficiaries. Of these, 41% were children under the age
of 18 who had known no other home than Puttalam. The original project set out to
provide 5,653 new houses (to only the original families) to replace the temporary
thatched huts, and to complete 1493 partly-constructed houses in Puttalam. In addition,
the project would finance construction of 9,885 latrines 5 for both IDPs and non-IDPs and
provide drinking water to 13,584 IDP families and 3,291 non IDP families. Following
restructuring, the expected beneficiaries also would include non-IDPs housing grant
recipients. The revised targets were: (a) construction of about 5441 new houses to
replace the temporary thatched huts, (b) completion of approximately 1493 partly-
completed houses in the refugee camps, and (c) construction of about 500 temporary
houses in the host communities for non-IDPs in Puttalam. The project also would train
IDP youth in Puttalam to address the shortage of skilled construction labors. The Village
Rehabilitation Committees (VRC) and Community Based Organizations (CBOs), which
included both IDP and non-IDP members are institutions that would also benefit from
training related to the management of water supply schemes.

1.5 Original Components

The project included three components (see Annex 2 for more detailed summaries).

Component One: Housing Assistance (U$ 16.1 million). This component was to
finance housing construction across the 141 refugee camps in Puttalam in proportion to
the housing demand. The Puttalam Project Unit (PPU) ranked refugee camps using three
social criteria: (i) percentage of temporary thatched houses in each camp; (ii) percentage
of IDP households who possessed land in each camp; and (iii) percentage of households
that opted to settle in Puttalam, as recorded in the UNHCR supervised census of IDPs
living in refugee camps in Puttalam in 2006. The socially ranked camps were then
screened in terms of three environmental indicators, namely, proclivity to flooding, land
surface, and quality of environment. The ranking of refugee camps was done with the
intent to phase the PHP over four years. All 141 refugee camps would be covered.
According to the original project design, a household within a refugee camp would have
to meet the following criteria to be entitled to housing assistance: (i) it must have a
title/legal ownership to land; (ii) the head of the household and the majority of household
members must have lived in the camp and showed strong willingness to settle in Puttalam
(as evidenced by the 2006 UNHCR survey); (iii) it should not have had a permanent
house in Puttalam; (iv) it should not have received similar housing assistance in its place


5
 7,885 of the latrines would be constructed as part of the housing units. 2,000 latrines would be provided under the
sanitation grant to IDPs and non-IDPs upon their demand.




                                                          3
of origin; and (v) it should have had a temporary or semi-permanent house within a
selected camp. If the household did not have clear title to the land on which the non-
permanent house was situated, it should have at least possessed the land at such date
where the title could be subsequently regularized prior to construction.

The project was based upon the home-owner driven construction. The provision of cash
grants would ensure beneficiary participation in the construction of their houses, facilitate
choice in house design and use of construction materials, and reduce the cost of
construction. Technical officers would supervise construction while a technical audit
would independently monitor compliance with engineering standards. The PPU would
help those VRCs that choose to procure cement, timber, and tiles in bulk in response to
supply constraints and price escalation. The homeowner-driven approach, the
transformation of refugee camps to improved habitat, community development, and
better environment management would strengthen the long-term sustainability of the PHP.

Component Two: Water, Sanitation, Environment Mitigation, and Settlement Plans
(US$ 15.9 million). This component aimed at upgrading IDP camps into sustainable
human settlements with clean and safe drinking water, better sanitation, and improved
living conditions in Puttalam. 6 The project would also provide water and sanitation in
certain adjoining and vulnerable non-IDP villages to mitigate potential non-IDP
resentment at the transfer of resources to IDPs.

Water. The PHP would provide drinking water to 13,584 IDP families in 136 refugee
camps and 3,291 non-IDP households. Non-IDP recipients would include those living in
source areas, en-route of the piped water schemes, and in villages without drinking water
adjacent to identified refugee camps. Pumping sites would be strategically located within
a demarcated zone and safe water distributed to refugee camps and non-IDP villages
through a system of storage tanks and pipes, or pumped through tube wells. Stand posts
would be considered the basic service level; however, households opting for a higher
service level such as yard taps and/or house connections would be able to do so provided
they paid the additional cost for the higher service level and the source yield is adequate.
Communities would be responsible for operations and maintenance (O&M) of standalone
water supply schemes. The local authorities would operate and maintain those schemes




6
  Puttalam is situated in a dry zone of Sri Lanka. Annual rainfall is between 15 to 30 centimeters (and is largely limited
to the months of November and December). The main source of drinking water is situated in a series of deep and
shallow aquifers. Studies have showed that the ground water is often contaminated with nitrates in areas where
intensive agriculture takes place. In addition, the excessive use of groundwater for agriculture and prawn farms has led
to a saline intrusion in other areas. The situation is exacerbated by the inappropriate design of latrines that leads to the
bacteriological contamination of ground water in several refugee camps. And several water sites are located on sand
dunes, marshy and flood prone areas. All the above factors imply the availability of safe drinking water as serious
concern in the Puttalam area.




                                                            4
that serve a cluster of refugee camps and adjoining villages. The type of scheme would
depend on location and ground water condition.

Sanitation. This sub-component would address the problem of inappropriate sewage
disposal in the IDP camps. It would help to conserve extant sources of ground water and
avoid bacteriological contamination of drinking water. Through this sub-component, the
project would construct appropriate latrines to all IDP households that receive the
housing support cash grants. In addition, the project would provide Rs. 25,000 cash grant
to non-recipients of the housing assistance to construct latrines in IDP and non-IDP areas.
Basic training on the total sanitation would also be provided under the project.

Environmental mitigation. This sub-component would finance the mitigation of priority
environmental issues and ensure that main roads within IDP camps do not contribute to
environmental hazards such as water logging due to rainfall and runoff. Environmental
Management Plans (EMPs) would be prepared for each refugee camp to recommend the
camp-specific risk mitigation measures. The North West Provincial Roads Department
(NWPRD) would identify the needed civil works, and prepare the engineering drawings
and bid documents. The PPU would invite bids for contractors to undertake civil works
while the local authorities would be responsible for O&M.

Comprehensive settlement plan and survey plan. This sub-component would finance
settlement plans and survey plans to guide the planned development and implementation
of basic building regulations in each camp. It would include technical assistance for:
preparation of survey/base plans for all camps, improvements of internal road and
drainage segments to mitigate environmental problems, preparation of physical
development plans (neighborhood plans) for all camps to structure the future growth, and
development of essential community services, among other activities.

Component Three: Technical Support for Implementation (US$ 785,000). This
component aimed at supporting project implementation through a series of technical
assistance activities, including:

Regularization of land titles. To regularize titles of those who possess land but lack
adequate documentation in all 141 refugee camps and adjoining non-IDP villages.

Communications campaign. To publicize and create awareness of the PHP by explaining
the beneficiary selection process, the cash grants, disbursement procedures, the legal
rights of IDPs, on-going programs for non-IDPs and issues pertaining to water
conservation. This activity aimed at improving transparency, accountability, and reducing
non-IDP resentment at the transfer of resources to IDPs.

Continuous social impact assessment (CSIA). To independently monitor community
perceptions, grievances, and feedback on project implementation on an ongoing basis.

Mid-term and prior-to-closing environmental audits. To examine the project’s
compliance with environmental guidelines and safeguards during implementation.




                                             5
Third party technical audit. To facilitate independent monitoring to determine if
construction complies with agreed technical standards. A five percent sample of
beneficiaries in all refugee camps would be audited and the recommendations would feed
into ongoing construction and subsequent rounds of project supervision.

Housing assessment survey (HAS). To assist in revalidating the household profile, land
ownership, the classification of shelter/semi-permanent house in each refugee camp and
the precise construction needs in the case of semi-permanent houses. The survey would
help technical officers to certify payment to eligible households, supervise construction
and facilitate implementation roll out.

Skills training for construction labor. To support the training of about 1,000 masons and
carpenters to bridge the shortage of skilled construction labor in Puttalam. The proposed
training courses would run for four months in each training site, and would consist of
classroom training and supervised on-the-job training.

Component Four: Project Management (US$ 1.34 million). This component would
support the implementation of the project at all levels. It would facilitate project
management activities at the MOR to manage and monitor the PHP as well as to support
the district administration to ensure proper implementation of the PHP at the district and
divisions’ level. Financing would cover: staff expenses; incremental operating costs that
include travel, transport, fuel, food, and lodging but not salaries; training of project
related staff; and the procurement of goods, including office equipment, two vehicles,
bicycles, and motor cycles. This component would also finance the implementation of a
Grievance Redressal Mechanism (GRM).

1.6 Revised Components

During the 2009 project restructuring, Component 1 (Housing Assistance) was revised to
address two main issues. First, as a result of a decision by the MOR and the Cabinet of
Ministers, the size of the housing grant for temporary houses was increased from Rs.
250,000 to Rs. 325,000. This measure aimed at ensuring a consistent housing policy
across the two IDA-funded projects that provided housing grants to IDPs. As originally
designed, the PHP allocated Rs. 250,000 for each beneficiary household, while the
NEHRP allocated Rs. 325,000. Ensuring uniform amounts for all of the beneficiaries
would reduce tensions related to the difference in grant allocations. However, it also
would reduce the total number of households that could receive a housing grant under
this project.

Second, the 2009 restructuring extended the benefits of Component 1 from only the IDPs
in selected refugee camps, to an additional number of the poorest non-IDP households in
adjacent communities across four divisions in Puttalam district. This change aimed at
improving social cohesion across communities served by the PHP by allowed a larger
number of households to be eligible for assistance.




                                            6
1.7 Other Significant Changes

As a result of the restructuring, the schedule of withdrawal of proceeds of the IDA credit
changed. An amount of US$ 0.9 million was reallocated from the physical contingencies
for water and sanitation to the housing grant category. This would help to compensate for
the changes introduced under the 2009 restructuring which would have implications fo
the number of housing grant beneficiaries.
Another change was the extension of the Credit closing date to December 31, 2011 to
allow the project to complete pending activities under the infrastructure component.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

This section summarizes the key factors during the preparation and the issues related to
quality at entry that affected the PHP implementation and outcomes.


Rationale for the Bank’s Intervention. The civil conflict between the GoSL and the
Liberation Tigers Tamil Elam (LTTE) rebels led to a loss of thousands of lives, displaced
persons belonging to all ethnic groups, and destruction of both public and private
infrastructure. Consequently, the GoSL was determined to ensure that all those people
directly or indirectly affected by the conflict, particularly IDPs, would be provided with
support for rebuilding their livelihoods and improving their habitat. At the time, the
GoSL needed resources and technical assistance to address the urgent development needs
of the IDPs. The PHP was consistent with the Government’s strategy to meet these needs.
The Government sought to encourage the IDPs to return to their place of origin where
possible, and to otherwise integrate them in their new location. The World Bank Group’s
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS, 2003) and the CAS Progress Report (2005) linked
development of the conflict-affected areas to the tenuous peace in Sri Lanka. In June
2005, the GoSL requested IDA to help meet the housing, drinking water, sanitation, and
environmental needs of the Puttalam IDPs. As noted above, the Bank assistance was
informed by a survey of IDPs carried out by the UNHCR in 2006 and an initial SA.
Throughout implementation, improving the wellbeing of the IDPs was among the
pertinent issues under the Bank’s engagement in Sri Lanka.

Government commitment. The Government’s commitment to dealing with the IDP
situation was demonstrated by the creation of the PPU based in Puttalam to address the
needs of the IDPs on a regular basis, provide oversight of the project performance
through the External Resource Department (ERD) as part of its overall functions, and to
co-finance the project in the amount of US$ 2.2 million.




                                            7
Clarity, focus, and flexibility of project design. The PDO was clearly defined to
address the issue of social integration of the IDPs together with the non-IDPs in Puttalam.
The housing and infrastructure components were designed to achieve this objective. The
choice of the owner driven approach to construction of the houses of the IDPs was aimed
at (a) ensuring that there was recipient ownership and (b) providing a habitation package
comprised of houses, water supply, sanitation, and connective infrastructure. At entry,
however, the magnitude of the potential delays in construction of the infrastructure and in
particular, the sequencing of road and water supply construction, was not taken into
account. The decision to place the project implementation unit in Puttalam and to have a
Project Steering Committee (PSC) at the centre, and a District Monitoring Committee
(DMC) at the district level, comprising of multiple stakeholders is testimony that the
intentions were right, and hence reflected the need to align the implementation functions
at the appropriate administrative level. In addition, the project established Village
Rehabilitation Committees (VRCs) at the local level to support beneficiary selection,
prioritization of IDP camps and non-IDP villages, and community contracting of housing
and infrastructure, among others. The project also invested substantially in developing
the vocational skills among the local population to support the construction industry of
the IDPs houses.

Adequacy of safeguard policies. Safeguard policies, as required under Bank policy,
were adequately integrated in the project design. An EMP was prepared during the early
preparation stages because there was no information on the number and location of
settlements that would be selected for funding under the project. Each settlement was
rapidly assessed for environmental issues prior to appraisal. The rapid assessment
resulted in establishment of basic environmental profiles of each site and a
recommendation on the suitability for long-term habitation. Stakeholder consultations
and EMF disclosures were an integral part of the safeguard assessments.

The CSIA was envisaged as a significant and independent social audit mechanism for the
PHP. However, it did not fulfill that function. The CSIA reports more often failed to
provide a critical review of the beneficiary selection process as well as the GRM and
other social related processes under the project.

Lessons of earlier operations. The design of the PHP drew from the experience of other
operations in post-conflict situations. Specifically, the project benefited from the North
East Housing Reconstruction Project (NEHRP, closed in 2011) and the Tsunami
Emergency Recovery Credit (TERC, closed in 2011) supported by IDA. The successful
approaches applied in these and other operations which were adopted in the project
design included: home owner-demand driven design; continuous oversight by
communities as well as district and central government authorities; POs, to augment
capacity, and adherence to fiduciary and social safeguard policies. Other useful
approaches applied in the design of this project include the training of local builders,
establishment of information centers at the camp level, formulation of construction
guidelines, and requirement for supervision mechanisms.




                                            8
Adequacy of participatory processes. The PHP was based on the concept of home-
owner driven construction. The provision of cash grants would ensure beneficiary
participation in the construction of their houses, facilitate increased choice in design, and
reduce the cost of construction materials. Technical officers would supervise
construction while a technical audit would independently monitor compliance with
engineering standards. The PPU would help those CBOs that choose to procure cement,
timber, and tiles in bulk in response to supply constraints and price escalation. The
homeowner-driven approach, the transformation of refugee camps to improve habitat,
community development, and better environment management would strengthen the
long-term sustainability of the PHP. Similarly, CBOs would establish institutional
mechanisms for the management of water supply schemes.

Project risks and mitigations. The key project risks and mitigation measures included:

Reputational Risk. There was concern about reputational risk especially if the quality of
houses constructed was poor. The PHP tried to mitigate this risk by issuing guidelines
and communicating to all beneficiaries to adhere to a specific set of standards of housing
(with 500 square feet) and toilet construction.

Political interference. There was the risk of political interference in camp and
beneficiary selections for housing and other infrastructure provisions. The PHP would
follow a robust selection process as well as implementation guidelines to mitigate
potential political interference.

Project design related risks. Due to a declining water table, there was a likelihood that
some of the wells would dry out (this remains a problem). The MOR was expected to
play a coordination role with the National Water Supplies and Drainage Board (NWSDB)
that had the technical capacity to explore possible alternatives for water supply in the four
schemes that were in a critical situation of water scarcity.

Technical capacity risk. The PPU was faced with difficulties in maintaining qualified
staff in the core technical areas of project implementation. Efforts would be made to
train staff on critical implementation issues such as procurement and social safeguards,
and to replace vacant posts from time to time.

Other implementation risks. There were cases of non-functioning water meters due to
poor units. To address this risk, the PHP would advise the CBOs on improving the
procurement processes for the metering equipment and on improving the billing system.

2.2 Implementation

As shown above, project restructuring was undertaken in 2009 to expand the provision of
housing from the originally planned permanent housing to selected IDPs in the refugee
camps as well as to a limited number of the poorest non-IDPs households in adjacent
communities across four divisions in Puttalam district. The restructuring was necessary
due to the emerging tensions at the time between the host communities and the IDPs.




                                              9
Initially the design of the housing component had not particularly paid enough attention
to the problem of the non-IDP poor households, an issue that caused initial tensions
between the IDPs and Host communities until when it was rectified during the
restructuring at mid-term. The effect of the restructuring, in line with the PDO, was to
facilitate social cohesion and integration between IDP and non-IDP communities served
under the PHP. As a result of the restructuring, the schedule of withdrawal of proceeds of
the IDA credit changed. An amount of US$ 0.9 million was reallocated from the physical
contingencies under water and sanitation to the housing grant category. This implied that
out of US$ 17.0 million for the housing component, a total of US$ 1.84 million was
allocated to finance non-IDP housing. However, this fund allocation was not expected to
result in a change in the PDO or trigger any safeguard policy.

Due to the nature of pending activities, the construction of water schemes, sanitation, and
roads, the PPU sought an extension of the Credit closing date by 12 months. However,
the Government granted only 6 months, implying that the project would close in
December 31, 2011. The extension was to allow the project to expedite the
implementation of pending activities. As discussed in the next section, the project
suffered from a slow start due to implementation issues. Following the announcement of
the new project closure, IDA cancelled SDR 5.04 million.

Overall, implementation arrangements for the various project components were generally
moderately satisfactory. The initial start up of implementation was very slow, particularly,
with regard to the water supply and roads construction components. This was in part due
to weak implementation capacity in the PPU. It was noted in independent review by the
Quality Assurance Group (QAG) in 2009 that the likelihood of the project achieving its
PDO was “moderately unlikely? due to recurring implementation problems. Since 2009,
however, there was a significant improvement in the implementation progress of the
project, particularly the housing and infrastructure components. As a result, the PDO
rating changed to moderately satisfactory.

Annex 2 shows the detailed outputs of the components. The factors that affected the PHP
implementation and how these were resolved is discussed below.

Housing Assistance

The main challenges affecting the timely completion of the housing assistance
component included:

(i) Weak technical supervision of the houses due to an insufficient number of technical
     officers (TOs) in the field;
(ii) Limited social mobilization and communication campaign leading to delays in
     construction of the houses;
(iii) Poor quality of finishing for some houses; and
(iv) Overly ambitious and unfinished housing structures beyond the original budget
     envelope provided for under the project for some houses.




                                            10
Subsequently, the numbers of TOs were increased, and the quality of technical
supervision improved (especially in the later years of project implementation). The PHP
also provided focused support to female headed households who were facing difficulties
in completing their houses.


Water, Sanitation, Environment Mitigation, and Settlement Plans

The key challenges that affected the timely completion of the water supply component
included:

(i) Inadequate technical analysis of engineering design of water schemes before
     finalization of project preparation and subsequently, implementation;
(ii) Delays in provision of electricity, particularly for Palliwasturai water supply scheme.
      The delays in provision of electricity negatively affected the provision of water
      supply to the beneficiaries served by the water scheme;
(iii) Delayed engagement of Partner Organizations (POs) to help the communities in
       forming their CBOs to ensure sustainability in the O&M of water schemes;
(iv) Weak capacity of the PPU that contributed to delayed responses to several critical
       aspects of implementation of water supply schemes, particularly with regard to
       procurement contracts;
(v) Protection of water sources remains a major concern. The sustainability of the
      schemes is contingent upon the quality of the source and the availability of water.
      The challenge is that the water table has further gone down and two of the four wells
      have dried out;
(vi) Delay in completion of roads contracts, partly because these were closely linked to
      the completion of some water schemes; and
(vii) Weak procurement capacity at the PPU level.

To mitigate some of these issues, implementation support teams advised the PPU to
coordinate with the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) to ensure timely provision of
electricity. However, the process was not an easy one and often the NWSDB was called
upon to help in coordination with the CEB. Efforts were also made to impart relevant
procurement capacity among key project staff. Partner organizations were contracted to
impart relevant skills to the CBOs so that they could better manage water supply schemes,
including providing for operational and maintenance expenses


2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

Design: The project design identified core indicators to assess the achievement of the
PDO. During restructuring, the indicator on housing was refined to address the inclusion
of the non-poor IDPs. The project proposed to establish a Monitoring and Evaluation
(M& E) system, with measurable indicators. The M&E system would be in place from
the start of the PHP to measure and evaluate the benefits and impacts of the project
components ex-post. It would contribute to effective project management. The M&E




                                            11
would capture basic data such as beneficiary information, technical certification of
ongoing civil works, and the release of funds. The M&E system would also enable a clear
link between the financial and physical progress of the established investments under
project. However, the overall quality of the original results framework can be assessed as
moderately satisfactory. Beside the lack of baseline data on some indicators, some of the
component indicators were not tracked systematically during implementation.

Implementation: More than one year into project implementation, the M&E was not
functional. After its establishment, the Bank team advised the PPU to hire a specialist to
support its operation and maintenance (O&M). The importance of backing up data and
establishment of a website were communicated to the PPU. As in the case of the NEHRP,
it was expected that the website would enable better dissemination of information,
thereby contributing to enhanced transparency. Thus, the PPU developed an in-house
data base to capture the physical and financial progress of the project implementation and
on all components of the project.

Utilization: The data collected were regularly used by the PPU to prepare periodic
reports to inform the Government and the Bank on ongoing implementation progress of
the project. To date, the PPU has established a large database of useful information that
can further be used in policy analysis, but this initiative has not been undertaken.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Social Issues

Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM). To enhance transparency and good governance,
the project set out to develop a GRM through which all IDP households would be able to
raise their grievances to the authorities in the event that an individual household disagrees
with its non-inclusion in the list of beneficiaries. The GRM covered mostly complaints
and grievances related to eligibility. On average, it took 4 weeks for the PPU to respond
to the grievances received from the complainants. The PPU claims to have addressed all
forms of grievances, although the key challenge lies in the objectivity with which these
were addressed (in the context of the PPU itself being the assessor and judges). In
practice, there was limited use of information on the GRM by the public despite efforts to
display information on the websites, PPU office and in all the VRC information centers.

Continuous Social Impact Assessment. The CSIA was envisaged as a significant and
independent social audit mechanism for the PHP. However, this mechanism never
fulfilled its function. The CSIA reports did not capture the pertinent issues in the PHP.
The reports did not provide a critical review of the beneficiary selection process, the
GRM, or its social ramifications. The reports did not highlight the implementation
shortcomings nor did they discuss the incipient political tensions impacting upon the PHP.
GreenTech, a firm which was awarded the contract for the CSIA, did not perform
adequately, although previous records in other assignments (e.g. under NEHRP and
TERC) documented that it had done a good job. The contract between Green-Tech and
PPU was terminated in 2011 due to the poor quality of the CSIA. Since then, however,




                                            12
no initiatives were taken to conduct a third party CSIAs. Social development officers and
social mobilizers of the PPU were engaged in preparing the CSIA; however, the quality
of the work was deemed poor by the implementation support teams.

Formation and strengthening of CBOs.

One of the key achievements under the project in relation to the PDO of social integration
was through CBOs that created a favorable environment for both the hosts and IDPs to
share and manage the water supply assets as a common property. Both host and IDPs
work together as one community and the leadership of the CBOs in most of the water
supply schemes is shared by members from both communities. Beneficiaries appreciated
the efforts under the project to provide clean and safe water. The challenges that faced
the CBOs included weak capacity and limited participation of women. Efforts were
made by the social mobilizers to engage female headed households in the total sanitation
campaign and in addition, provide capacity support to the CBOs to undertake their
responsibilities.

Environmental Issues

From the outset of the project, the physical environment in which the IDP settlements are
located posed environmental issues. There is a severe hardship with regard to obtaining
reliable and clean potable water in Puttalam. In addition, improper sanitation, over
fertilization of the vegetable fields, over-abstraction for irrigation and aquaculture, and
waste disposal from aquaculture farms have all contributed to the poor quality and
scarcity of groundwater. Various studies have shown that nitrate concentration in many
of the irrigation dug wells has far exceeded the limit recommended by the World Health
Organization (WHO). The people, especially those living in close proximity to cultivated
areas as in the case of many IDP settlements, face serious health risks of consuming
nitrate contaminated water because there is no other alternative source available. In
addition, some settlements, especially those in Puttalam mainland, have serious water
stagnation and flooding issues. These settlements are located in low-lying wetland areas
and drainage pathways with poor infiltration capacity and hence become unlivable during
wet weather.

Another issue is that of solid waste disposal, which is a problem in all IDP settlements
because there is no proper system for collection and disposal of garbage. In addition,
there is destruction of mangroves by IDPs for land reclamation and other uses, sand
mining within settlements, and exposure to pollution from wastes from prawn farms.

Safeguard management process: An EMP was prepared for the project during the early
preparation stages. As preparation moved forward, it was decided that all settlements
would be eligible to benefit from the project and hence it was required that each
settlement be rapidly assessed for environmental issues/impacts prior to appraisal. Thus,
in order to assess the existing environmental issues in IDP settlements and those
anticipated as a result of the project interventions, 114 IDP settlements were rapidly
assessed based on an environmental checklist under three different housing scenarios: (i)




                                            13
housing construction on the existing site of the camp; (ii) housing construction on the
land adjacent to the site; and (iii) relocation on completely new sites. Because (i) and (ii)
did not apply, safeguard requirements of (iii) only were considered. The rapid assessment
resulted in basic environmental profiles of each site being established and a
recommendation was made on the site’s suitability for long-term habitation. With project
implementation designed to take place in a phased manner, detailed EMFs were prepared
for those camps in each phase on completion of camp selection and prior to
commencement of construction. The EMFs studied the issues identified during the rapid
assessment and prepared detailed mitigation plans.

Stakeholder Consultation and EMFs disclosure: This was an integral part of the
safeguards assessments undertaken under the project. Consultations were carried out with
the district officials, village administrators and extensively with the IDPs. The EMFs
were disclosed to the public locally as well as through the Bank’s Infoshop.

Good practices employed by the project: The PHP was originally proposed as an
additional credit to the NEHRP. While the broad project objectives were to remain the
same, the PHP would include water supply to selected beneficiaries (funded by UNICEF)
and rehabilitation of selected internal roads. Subsequently, with the PHP evolving into a
standalone project, the scope and coverage of the ancillary infrastructure components
such as drinking water, sanitation and improved drainage increased substantially in
response to key findings and recommendations of the EAs. The project took on the
challenge of addressing two difficult environmental issues that affected the IDP
settlements, that is, the supply of drinking water to all IDP communities and selected host
communities (as UNICEF was funding a very limited number of IDP camps) and second,
mitigation of flood risk in vulnerable areas through improved drainage in order to provide
a better living environment to those living in these poorly served settlements and not a
house only.

Key challenges during preparation: The PHP aimed at improving the habitat of the IDPs
in which environmental improvement and management has played a pivotal role. The
main challenges faced were:

(i) The settlements are located in a tough environment, improvement of which has posed
    real challenges in terms of technical feasibility and resources required. Mitigation of
    existing environmental issues inside IDP camps could be accommodated only on a
    limited extent and on a priority basis. For example, improvements to land drainage in
    some sites (such as Karambe and Puttalam mainland cluster) requires substantive
    effort and investment involving land filling and extensive drainage networks which
    were beyond the scope of PHP;

(ii) Sustainability of the drainage improvement work in IDP settlements carried out by
     the project is also at risk given that they are mostly earth drains which can return to
     its original status in a short time if not properly maintained;




                                             14
(iii) Considering the potential health risks posed by the water and sanitation situation in
      the IDP settlements, it was essential to ensure that adequate water sources (with
      acceptable water quality) along with proper sanitary facilities were provided to all
      camps under the project. The project had to invest in a series of technical feasibility
      studies and site explorations in a bid to find sources that can provide water of
      acceptable standard. These explorations took much time contributing to further
      delays in project implementation;

(viii) Weak capacity of the PPU resulted in not only inadequate focus on
      implementation, but also limited coordination with other agencies concerned with
      environmental planning process. Staffing in the PPU continued to be a challenge.
      The position of the senior environmental specialist experienced high staff turnover
      and the long periods in between recruitments witnessed poor or complete standstill
      of EMP implementation. Because Puttalam is not a preferred choice of work place
      for many, recruiting and retaining suitably qualified people was a challenge which
      adversely affected the continued and consistent application of environmental
      safeguards. In addition, the understanding and commitment of the project
      management to achieving the environmental objectives of the PHP was less than
      satisfactory. Despite continued IDA supervision, low capacity and commitment of
      the project critically affected its performance on environmental safeguards. The issue
      of weak capacity was raised in almost every supervision mission with the PPU and
      higher implementing authorities, however, the project has remained weak in
      safeguards implementation;

(ix) Weak implementation of resource management plans. Although the resource
     management plans were prepared these were not linked to the supply sources, and
     thus failed to meet the intended objectives. Monitoring from the PPU and engagement
     of other relevant authorities was weak;

(x) Finding sources that provide good quality drinking water was technically challenging.
    The NWSDB identified 12 water schemes out of which 4 had to be abandoned for
    lack of a suitable water source. Alternative options were discussed but abandoned due
    to cost and sustainability related issues. As for the 8 schemes, sustainability would be
    contingent upon the quality of water at the source. Some of the schemes are
    vulnerable to water contamination from expanding agricultural activities and
    settlements in the near future unless measures are taken to protect them. IDA
    missions raised the importance of protecting the source catchment through a
    systematic process of planning and consultations with the community, district
    administration and other key stakeholders. Unfortunately, these consultations have
    not progressed beyond preliminary discussions, with neither the NWSDB nor the
    PMU taking a lead to address the issue comprehensively. Moreover, the land and
    social issues involved are complex and the resources required (time, financial and
    capacity) are enormous;

(xi) Establishing environmentally suitable, technically feasible, and cost effective sanitary
     options for the IDP settlements was a difficult task given the physical conditions of




                                             15
   the project area and limited resources allocated for the purpose. The NWSDB was
   contracted to study the sanitary situation in the IDP settlement. The study was
   expected to provide timely and suitable solutions. However, it took long to finalize
   and was not sequenced with the rest of the project activities;

(xii) The importance of regular water quality monitoring was stressed by the Bank task
    team and was included as part of the O&M for schemes to be carried out by the CBOs.
    The CBOs received basic training in water quality monitoring. This is considered
    very important as none of the schemes have water treatment.

(xiii) The EMFs flagged the issue of collection and haphazard disposal of solid waste
    within the camps and the need to address the problem. The camps are not served by
    the local authorities as they come under the jurisdiction of the MOR. Poor drainage is
    likely to provide breeding ground for mosquitoes raising the risk of dengue fever
    occurrence in the IDP camps. The garbage problem remains an issue in the IDP
    camps.

Fiduciary Aspects

Overall, financial management is rated satisfactory. However, procurement is rated as
moderately satisfactory.

Financial management. In terms of fund flow, one year prior to project closure, the
project had disbursed US$ 15.7 million (roughly 49 %). An estimated US$ 16.3 million
was yet to be disbursed. The slow disbursement was largely attributed to the delays in
procurement of the different activities under the project, particularly under the water and
roads sub-components. The delays in procurement were attributed to lack of adequate
procurement capacity among the project staff.

Other key weaknesses in financial management of the project were (i) internal audits
were not conduct in a timely manner as the audits were done by GoSL staff. The internal
audit department of the MOR lacked the incentives for performing the project internal
audits and (ii) late submission of quarterly Financial Monitoring Reports to IDA and
delays in submission of external audit reports. Overall, however, project financial
management norms were followed by the PPU. For example, the external audit report for
2009 carried out by the Auditor General (AG) did not reveal any major accountability or
internal control weaknesses.

Procurement. The PPU did not have adequate procurement capacity at the start of
project implementation. The PPU delayed submission of the procurement plan.
International Competitive Bidding (ICB) contracts for the construction of water supply
schemes were substantially delayed because of the PPU’s late issuance of the invitation
for bids in local newspapers, despite IDA’s issuance of a no objection in time. In most
cases, the situation was exacerbated by the limited coordination between the MOR and
the project unit as well as the PPU’s ad hoc record keeping practices. Subsequently, with
IDA’s support, the procurement knowledge base was improved and efforts were made to




                                            16
ensure there was a full-time procurement specialist at the PPU to handle procurement
related issues.



2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

Since the restoration of peace and stability in Sri Lanka in May 2009, the GoSL has
embarked upon several initiatives to address the habitation needs of the IDPs. Besides the
PHP and NEHRP, there are other ongoing housing schemes supported by the GoSL,
Government of India, UNHABITAT, Government of Kuwait and Government of Qatar.

This review would recommend efforts to address the water scarcity and quality issues
(e.g. by working with the NWSDB). In addition, it is important to strengthen the capacity
of the local authorities to monitor and sustain the roads and drainage investments
established under the project.


In terms of O&M of the water supply schemes, institutional support to the CBOs would
be required to ensure sustainability. Because housing is a private good, it is expected that
the project beneficiaries would take full responsibility for maintaining their properties
because the quality of the housing is good. Nonetheless, if there is a major flooding
problem, there could be issues of sustainability.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

In June 2005, IDA responded to the GoSL’s request for a PHP to address the critical
housing, drinking water, sanitation, and environmental needs of the IDPs. The objectives
of the project at the time were consistent with the GoSL’s strategy to meet the
development needs of IDPs by encouraging them to return to their original homes where
possible, and to otherwise integrate them with the host non-IDP population in their
preferred new location. Despite the implementation difficulties, the project was able to
contribute toward the objective of social integration in a post-conflict situation in Sri
Lanka. In the current Country Partnership Strategy (CPS), the results of the project are
still relevant, particularly, from the point of view of addressing social inclusion.

Design and Implementation. The integrated package of housing, water supply,
sanitation, and roads was well designed. The provision of the entire package would
contribute to improving the living conditions of the beneficiaries in both the IDP and
non-IDP communities. Therefore, the intentions underlying the package were good and
remain valid, although some pre-implementation (engineering designs for water schemes)
and implementation challenges affected the satisfactory performance of the project, and
most project activities occurred in the last 18 months prior to closure.




                                            17
3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

The overall achievement of the PDO is rated as moderately satisfactory.

The project achieved its intended development objective of supporting the integration of
IDPs in Puttalam by upgrading and improving the habitat, water and sanitation facilities
of both IDPs and select non-IDPs, and providing eligible IDPs in refugee camps and a
limited number of non-IDPs in the host communities with housing. However, if the
project had a better start and was not affected by excessive delays in different project
sub-activities, the rating would have been higher.

Almost 90 percent of the targeted housing units were constructed within the allocated
budget, although with some initial delays in implementation. It also provided safe
drinking water to about 40 percent of the target number of families. This shortfall could
be explained by two factors: first, 4 out of the 12 planned water supply schemes were not
constructed due to lack of water source; and second, probably overestimation of the
potential beneficiaries. It is documented that the settlement plans were prepared for 130
IDPs. In summary, the main project benefits included:

   (i) Delivery of clean drinking water supply in a typically dry district;
   (ii) ;
   (i) Improvement in the habitat for both IDPs and non-IDP poor households;
   (ii) Capacity support to both IDPs and non-IDPs to tackle environmental problems of
        solid waste management, and tree planting; and
   (iii)Improvement of access roads and drainage in the IDPs and non-IDP areas
        facilitated increase in economic activity and thus, indirectly contributed to job
        creation.

More broadly, the project contributed to social integration through the investments in
housing, water supply and roads. Provision of housing to the IDPs and selected poor non-
IDPs improved social cohesion in Puttalam. The formation of the CBOs contributed to
social integration by creating an enabling environment through which different segments
of the IDPs and non-IDPs discuss the water supply situation in Puttalam. Both host and
IDPs work together as one community and the leadership of the CBOs in most of the
water supply schemes is shared by members from both communities. These findings
suggest that CBOs were inclusive and served as the vehicle for enhancing this social
integration. Finally, improvements in roads enhanced connectivity within the camps and
between the camp and the nearby trading towns in Puttalam.

It is important to recognize that the restructuring in 2009 and the subsequent
implementation of the revised project were critical factors contributing to the change in
the overall performance of the project turning the PDO from moderately unsatisfactory (a
rating that persisted for more than two years from February 2009 until June 2011) to
moderately satisfactory (a rating that prevailed from June 2011 until project closing in
December 2011).

3.3 Efficiency

At appraisal, the PHP was expected to have an economic payback and positive net
benefits to the direct beneficiaries and adjacent communities. The analysis at appraisal
showed that at a broader level, there was a multiplier effect of new housing construction
for which on average, each dollar spent on construction would see an increase in wages
of about US$ 0.34 in the local economy in Puttalam. About 543 jobs would be created as
a result of the housing construction. The skills training program was expected to increase
individual incomes of the job-training beneficiaries by an average of about US$ 1,115 per
annum. The analysis showed a NPV of the credit disbursed in four years as US$ 26.5
million. The PHP benefited 13,600 families in 136 refugee camps and over 3,300
adjoining non IDP families. The average cost of providing safe water would be Rs.
49,000 per person, approximately US$ 486 equivalent.

At completion, the project was able to realize several benefits from the infrastructure
investments. Some of these benefits are quantified and are the basis of the efficiency
argument presented in Annex 3.

With respect to housing, the project facilitated construction of 5441 new houses and 1493
semi-permanent houses. In addition, 500 construction workers were trained. The analysis
estimated the values of the houses constructed and the benefits from improving the skills
of construction workers. The benefits from the housing support component include both
direct and indirect benefits. The direct benefits include the value of the new housing
stock and the incremental value of the reconstructed housing stocks. The indirect benefits
from the project included multiplier impacts of wage incomes of construction workers
generated from the housing construction, new and reconstruction program. Several
assumptions were made to arrive at the estimates summarized in this section (see detailed
Annex 3). The average asset values of a new house and the value added of a
reconstructed house are estimated at Rs. 600 and Rs. 400 thousands respectively. These
estimates are used to estimate the aggregate value of the houses constructed/reconstructed.
It is further assumed that the values of the houses constructed appreciate over time in the
project area at an annual rate of 6 percent. In order to compute the multiplier impacts of
wage income and construction expenditures a multiplier of 1.4 was used in this analysis.
It is assumed that the trained workers would earn additional wage incomes for the next 15
years of their productive life. The Net Present Value and the Benefit: Cost ratios based on
the cost stream and the estimated benefit stream from the housing component of the
project is presented below (Table 3):

The results show that the project yielded modest returns measured in terms of Benefit:
Cost ratio and Net Present Value of cost and benefit streams. At 8% rate of interest and 4
percent appreciation in house values, the Benefit: Cost ratio was 3.75, which implies that
a dollar invested in the housing component yielded $3.75 as returns. The Net Present
Value at 8% interest rate was Rs. 6,096 million. A sensitivity analysis was carried out
assuming 2 percent and 6 percent appreciations in house values at different 10 and 12
percent interest rates. The sensitivity analysis showed that even at 12 percent interest rate
and 2 percent appreciation in house values, the investment would yield Benefit: Cost ratio
of 1.78 and net present value of Rs. 3168 million. The results are consistent with the
results of the ex-ante economic analysis conducted at the time of project preparation.

With respect to water and sanitation, the project provided improved water connections to
3754 families in 69 camps and 2373 families in 19 host villages. The sanitation sub-
component contributed to construction of latrines for 6934 new and reconstructed houses.
In addition, it facilitated construction of 1669 latrines as part of the sanitation grant to the
IDPs and community toilets in schools, and health centers. The benefits of improvements
in water and sanitation included reduction in health-related expenditures and benefits to
the consumers of water and sanitation services (including value of time savings). In order
to estimate the benefits from improved water and sanitation, the analysis uses parameter
estimates from the study on benefits from providing access to water and sanitation in Sri
Lanka conducted by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2004(details in Annex 3).
The analysis showed that the water and sanitation component yielded modest returns
measured in terms of Benefit: Cost ratio and Net Present Value of cost and benefit
streams. At 8% rate of interest the Benefit: Cost ratio was 2.3, which implies that a dollar
invested in the project yielded $2.3 as returns. At a higher discount rate of 12 percent the
project returned a Benefit: Cost ratio of 1.87. Sensitivity analysis was carried out for
these results. At a discount rate of 12 percent the project yielded a commendable Benefit:
Cost ratio of 1.87. Overall, the results suggest that the project yielded significant returns
to investment. The results are in agreement with the ex-ante economic analysis measures
at appraisal.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: moderately satisfactory

The overall rating is based on the relevance of the project to the CAS, Government
Strategy documents at the time, and the current Government’s Development Strategy.
The PDO was achieved by delivering housing to IDPs and non-IDPs households as well
as provision of basic water supply and sanitation and building institutional mechanisms to
enhance social integration. While the rating would have been higher, particularly, taking
into account the fact that a larger percentage of the entire housing package was completed,
there were variations in performance across the components and most importantly, the
issue of sustainability of the established investments is not so strong for the water,
sanitation, and solid waste disposal sub-components.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

Out of 5,653 new houses targeted under the project, 5441 were completed. As shown
above, over 13,000 families in IDP camps and another 3,300 non-IDPs benefited from the
project investments. This package has contributed to improving the welfare of the
beneficiaries. There was a special effort to address the needs of the female-headed
households. Similarly, the role of community involvement in housing, water supply,
sanitation, and solid waste management was very strong. In fact, the benefits from the
eight water supply schemes demonstrate the social integration benefits underlying the
PDO. Lastly, one of the important activities of the PHP was to create required
construction skills among the Puttalam IDPs so that they can build their houses and
provide labor for others. In this regard, about 500 workers benefited from the skills
training program. The program was designed to meet the demand for skilled and semi-
skilled masons and carpenters in project areas. This workforce would lift the welfare of
many individuals out of poverty.

Beneficiary surveys and stakeholder workshops were not undertaken.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Substantial




                                           21
The overall risk to the development outcome at the time of project closure is rated as
substantial, due in part to the following key reasons (other factors are discussed in sub-
section 2.2 above):

Sustainability of the water supply schemes. There is a major concern about the water
table declining further and about water quality deterioration. Although both of these
concerns can be mitigated, it would require enormous resources to dig deep wells as well
as periodically monitor and address the water quality issues. Although the CBOs appear
to have been institutionalized and indeed serve as a main vehicle for social integration
between the IDP and non-IDPs, the challenge would be ensuring continuity in mobilizing
resources to contribute to O& M. This challenge would likely materialize if there is a
decline in water supply caused by failure of water wells. Given the magnitude of the
problem, the sustainability of the water supply investments would require strong
coordination between NWSDB, the local authorities, CBOs, and other actors. The key to
ensuring this coordination would be a facilitator, and the role of the MOR and MoLG,
among others, would be especially critical in this regard.

Sustainability of the housing related investments. There is a likelihood that the houses
(as a private good) would serve the recipients for a long time in the future, and clearly
living conditions would never be the same as before the project intervened. The recipients
may choose to stay in Puttalam or they may choose to sell the houses and relocate to
other places of their choice in Sri Lanka. In the worst case scenario, however, the quality
of the constructed houses could deteriorate in the event of heavy flooding in Puttalam,
given the fact that some IDP settlements are situated in low lying areas. Although there
is no clear mitigation plan at the moment, the Government could address this risk by
establishing mechanisms for managing floods in the event they occur.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The Bank team correctly focused on social integration of the IDPs in Puttalam district
through provision of permanent housing. In the design of the housing component,
however, the team initially did not pay sufficient attention to the problem of the non-IDP
poor households, an issue that caused initial tensions between the IDPs and the host
communities until the issue was rectified during the restructuring at mid-term. On the
other hand, the infrastructure component, particularly the water sub-component, served as
a vehicle through which social integration was strengthened. In addition, the Bank team
ensured that the sanitation and roads sub-components were well conceived and reflected
in the PDO.




                                            22
(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank team conducted regular supervision missions, and provided regular
backstopping from the Colombo office and from headquarters. Except for the changes in
the task leadership over three times, the Bank team benefited from having an institutional
memory of the core technical specialists who worked with the PPU right from the initial
project implementation stages through to formal closure of the project. The task team
provided technical assistance on all implementation aspects (safeguards, fiduciary, other
technical and engineering designs) and carried out onsite field visits. The task team
regularly met with various stakeholders, and tried to enhance coordination among
implementing agencies directly or indirectly involved in the project. To cite one example,
the Bank team provided advice on establishment of a process audit with the PHP. The
aim of the process audit was to provide an independent assessment of the various
procedures that were followed by the project in the field for all components in general,
and housing, in particular, compared to documented procedures in the Operational
Manual (OM). The audit would provide a comparison and then identify weaknesses and
recommend changes to the current procedures in light of best practices to further
streamline and improve project implementation processes.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

Overall bank performance is rated satisfactory based on the following activities that were
regularly carried out by the Bank task team: (i) tailoring project preparation to owner-
driven approach, both for the housing construction and the maintenance of water supply
schemes; (ii) regularly supervising and monitoring actual physical progress and in turn
providing timely feedback to improve implementation; (iii) focusing adequate attention to
monitoring the fund flows; (iv) regularly monitoring certification and payment processes;
(v) ensuring due diligence with regard to the process of beneficiary selection; (vi)
regularly communicating with the PPU; (vii) suggesting alternative options for improving
project; (viii) basing implementation procedures on other ongoing and similar
interventions in Sri Lanka; (ix) providing regular and timely approvals of procurement
packages; and (x) coordinating various project implementing agencies.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately satisfactory.

The MOR, as the key leading agency in charge of the project, provided adequate overall
oversight throughout the project life. However, the agency could have been stronger in
coordination, policy making on IDPs in Puttalam and advocacy, and providing strategic
guidance for project implementation. For example, the MOR could have been more pro-
active in facilitating coordination between the PPU and other relevant agencies (e.g. the
electricity and water utilities), when the PPU had difficulty accomplishing this

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The implementation agency was based in Puttalam to ensure that it had day to day
glimpse of project implementation and its challenges. The project team, particularly the
project director, was fully conversant with the challenges facing the IDPs in Puttalam.
Throughout the project life there was one Director, thus providing solid institutional
memory and fostering continuity in project implementation. With the exception of the
last two years when the project had stable engineers and technical officers on duty, the
project suffered from lack of full time technical personnel in environment, social
safeguards, procurement, and financial management. According to the PPU, this was due
to the difficulty in finding suitably qualified people interested in working and settling in
Puttalam.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

In spite of the difficulties at the start, the PPU succeeded in attaining the PDO (based on
the results) as evidenced by the implementation progress of the project. Generally, the
PPU suffered from weak capacity; however, concerted efforts were made throughout
implementation to improve staffing and to provide training in relevant areas, especially
procurement and technical work. There is a strong institutional memory in the PPU with
one Director throughout implementation. The PPU increased its visibility regularly in the
IDP and non-IDP camps and as a result, was able to receive up to date information on
implementation progress and challenges. The MoR provided an oversight role during




                                            24
project implementation, although it was felt that it could have done much more in
coordinating the project with other supporting agencies such as CEB and NWSDB




6. Lessons Learned

Implementation arrangements. The implementation arrangements with a field-based
project unit in Puttalam helped to address the needs of the IDPs in Puttalam in a timely
manner. However, the project demonstrated that effective implementation through this
model requires a well capacitated project unit coupled with effective coordination at the
center. While coordination was provided by the center, it was not sufficient to support
implementation of the PHP in Puttalam.

Planning for integrated investments. Housing, water, sanitation, and roads relate
closely to each other and thus, any interventions that provides these services in a package
require integrated planning covering technical design aspects, staffing, and sequencing
of implementation. In the PHP, a key factor that contributed to slow project
implementation was inadequate planning for water and roads sub-components. Similarly,
planning for housing and sanitation also needs to take place in an integrated manner.

Owner-driven construction. This ICR recognizes the challenges that were faced by the
home-owners in undertaking housing construction as per schedule, but the experience
seemed to have been appreciated by the owners. The provision of cash grants ensured
beneficiary participation in the construction of their houses, facilitated choice in design
and use of construction materials, and reduced the cost of construction. Technical
officers supervised construction while a technical audit independently monitored
compliance with engineering standards. The PPU helped those CBOs that choose to
procure cement, timber, and tiles in bulk in response to supply constraints and price
escalation. The homeowner-driven approach provided an effective platform for
beneficiary participation and as a result, the houses not only conformed to technical
specifications but also met the preferences of the beneficiaries.

Job training program/skills development. One of the important activities of the PHP
was to create required construction skills among the Puttalam IDPs. The skills training
program was designed to meet the demand for skilled and semi-skilled masons and
carpenters in project areas. In total, 300 mason and 200 carpenters were trained under the
housing component. The initiative was a success and can be replicated successfully
because it builds on the existing local skills base.

Community involvement in water supply investments. One of the institutional
mechanisms for social integration that worked well under the project was the formation
of CBOs for managing water supply schemes. Partner organizations were contracted to
impart relevant skills to the CBOs so that they could better manage water supply schemes,
including providing for operational and maintenance expenses. As shown in the




                                            25
assessment, one of the key achievements under the project in relation to the PDO is
through CBOs that have created a favorable environment for both the hosts and IDPs to
share and manage the water supply assets as a common property. Both host and IDPs
work together as one community and the leadership of the CBOs in most of the water
supply schemes is shared by members from both communities.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Component One: Housing (US$ 17.56 Million): The housing component constituted
69.7 percent of the total project cost. As described in the main text, the PHP was
premised upon the home-owner driven construction approach with enhanced beneficiary
participation. Under the component, housing cash grants were given to 5550 IDPs in
three phases and 563 non-IDP households in one phase for new construction of housing.
Under the home improvement cash grant, 1500 IDPs benefited in three phases.

The key steps and processes that were involved in the housing component are outlined
below:

(i)    Selection of Welfare Centers. The welfare centers (camps) were ranked according
       to social a criterion that took into account the following factors with weights in
       parenthesis.
-      Percentage of temporary thatched houses in each camp (75%);
-      Percentage of IDP households who possessed land in each camp (15%); and
-      Percentage of households that opted to settle in Puttalam as recorded in the UNHCR
       supervised census of IDPs living in refugee camps in April, 2006 (10%).

Next, an environmental screening process was carried out with the following indicators:
-    Proclivity to flooding (40%);
-    Land surface and (40%); and
-    Quality of environment (20%)

(ii)   Selection criteria for IDPs. A household within a refugee camp would have to meet
       certain criteria to be entitled to housing assistance:
-      It must have had title to land;
-      The head of the household and the majority of household members must have lived
       in the camp as determined by the 2006 UNHCR survey (condition considered
       before restructuring of the project);
-      It should not have had a permanent house in Puttalam and should not have received
       similar assistance in its place of origin; and
-      It should have possessed land in the camp and have had a temporary or partly
       completed house within the camp as of April 2006.

(iii) Housing Assessment Survey (HAS). The HAS revalidated the household profile,
      the classification of houses and lands and 100% solid proof of ownership of the
      land with proof assessing the proxy indicators, which complied with the results of
      the UNHCR census. This survey ensured that the construction supervision
      facilitated the implementation facilities and that correct payments were made to the
      right persons.
(iv) Preparation of list of beneficiaries.



                                           28
(v) Publication of beneficiaries’ lists.
(vi) Awareness programs about selection where eligible beneficiaries would be briefed.
(vii) Receiving grievances and resolving them.
(viii) Publish final list of beneficiaries; and
(ix) Disbursement of the Cash grant.

With respect to the non-IDPs, housing would be offered to the most vulnerable living in
temporary housing in the 32 Grama Niladari Divisions where IDP settlements received
housing assistance. The basic criteria for selection of the eligible beneficiaries for non-
IDP housing assistance were:
-    Have title to land;
-    Permanent residence in the village;
-    Possess a temporary house;
-    Number of disabled family members;
-    Female headed families;
-    Number of family members; and
-    Low income families.

A weighting process for selection of the non-IDP beneficiaries was taken into account
with the following factors: dependency of family (40%); number of disabled family
members (20%); women headed families (20%); and recipient of samurdhi assistance
(20%). A summary of the selection processes involved were:

-    Selection of eligible GN Divisions and allocated housing stock to the GN Divisions;
-    Identification of eligible non-IDP housing beneficiaries and ranking them;
-    Publication of the beneficiaries list;
-    Grievance Redressal Mechanism (GRM) and final list;
-    Awareness programme for officials, meeting with the Grama Niladaris, discussion
     with District Secretary and the Divisional Secretaries;
-    Community awareness programme activities for host community and civil society
     (meeting with Pradeshiya Sabhas members, mosque leaders and CBOs); and
-    Formation of Housing Development Committees

Water. This sub-component provided safe water facilities to the IDPs camps and Non
IDPs located in the perimeter of the welfare centers. The inclusion of non-IDPs was
consistent with the objective of social integration under the project to allow for sharing of
resources across the communities (both for IDPs and non-IDPs).The target under the sub-
component was to provide safe drinking water facilities to 13,584 IDP families and 3291
Non-IDP families. The project set out to construct 12 water supply schemes.

The sub-component targeted provision of safe drinking water facilities to 13,584 IDP
families and 3291 Non-IDP families. As shown in Table 4, eight new water supply
schemes were constructed covering 63 IDP camps and 19 host community Villages
(Refer to table for the names of the schemes). Metered water connections were provided
to 3460 IDP families and 2373 local communities. In addition, the Puttalam urban water
supply scheme was extended allowing for provision of 288 metered connection covering
6 IDP camps. The water supply schemes cover both IDPs and the non-IDP settlements, a
coverage rate of about 60-70% IDPs and 30-40% non-IDPs.

In order to establish the water supply schemes, communities and PSs would need land
and thus, issues of land acquisition and official transfer were very pertinent to the sub-
component. The communities would have to acquire small areas of land for the water
tanks, wells and pump houses. The land would be acquired either from the government in
case of public land, or through donations or buying from private owners. In all cases, the
PPU was advised on maintaining and adherence to the standard Bank policies
underpinning land acquisitions and other safeguards. The PPU would have to maintain
separate files on all land transactions in each individual water scheme, including land
bought and other related information. Prior to project closure, the PPU was informed of
the need to ensure that all land in connection with the water supply schemes was
transferred to the relevant CBO before the closure of the project in order to ensure long-

term community ownership and maintenance. Public lands transferred to the Project
Director ex officio would have to be transferred to the relevant CBO. Similarly, private
lands donated to the Project Director ex officio would have to be transferred to the
relevant CBO. At the time of project closure systematic steps were undertaken by the
PPU to ensure transfer of the deeds to the relevant CBOs.

The remaining 4 schemes, namely, Karambe, Kalapitiya, Mundel, and Erukalampitya,
were not constructed due to unavailability of good water of sources (both yield and
quality) in nearby camps. Alternative proposals debated during the course of
implementation did not seem feasible on technical, time-wise and cost-wise basis.

Environmental Mitigation/Roads component. The sub-component provided
environment mitigation in all camps to safeguard against flooding. It involved
construction of roads, culverts and drains. There were 11 road packages under
implementation for the rehabilitation and improvement of about 149.1 kilometers of
internal roads in the refugee camps. In addition, by project completion 384 culverts were
completed. By 2010, three road packages had been finalized and awarded. These were
Kandakuliya & Palliwasalthuray, Kalapitiya and Mundel. Another two packages, namely,
Hidayath Nagar and Karambe, were under bid evaluation. Lastly, another five road
packages, namely, Wattakandal, Alankuda, Norochola, Mudallapaly, and Puttalam were
under various stages of the bidding process. Implementation support missions noted with
concern that it was likely that 7 of the 11 contracts would not be completed prior to
project closure. The implication was that disbursements would delay to a tune of about
60% of the total amount for the roads sub-component. ? This situation triggered a rush in
the implementation of the roads sub-component. While the gravel roads constructed
under this sub-component are of reasonably good quality and underpinned by sound
engineering design, there was no provision to take care of drainage.

Sanitation: This sub-component aimed at improving the quality of life of the IDP and
non-IDP communities in Puttalam. It targeted to construct 2000 new toilets, and to
improve the communities’ environmental hygienic practices. Through the sub-component,
1669 out of the targeted 1854 toilets were constructed. In addition, all IDP and non-IDP
communities in Puttalam benefited from an education campaign on environmental
hygiene practices. The sub-component provided 335 composite bins for disposing
garbage and encouraged production of composite fertilizers. Through the project a
number of trees and shade trees were also planted in the camps.

Economic analysis at project completion

We present below the costs, benefits and economic analysis of the housing component
and the water & sanitation component. Since estimation of the benefits from the capacity
building and project management components could not be done, we have not attempted
economic analysis of those components.

Housing component

Costs and outputs

The actual costs and outputs of the housing component are presented below. This
component facilitated construction of 5441 new houses and 1493 semi-permanent houses
and training for about 500 construction workers over the period 2008-2012.

Benefits

In order to estimate the benefits, we have estimated the values of the houses constructed
and the benefits from improved skills of construction workers as a result of the training
imparted. The benefits from the housing support component include both direct and
indirect benefits and are outlined below:

Direct benefits: The direct benefits include:
   • Value of the new housing stocks (5,441 new houses ) and the incremental value of
        the reconstructed housing stocks (1,493) with direct housing assistance to the IDP
        and non-IDP families;

Indirect benefits: The indirect benefits from the project included:
    • Multiplier impacts of wage incomes of construction workers generated from the
        housing construction, new and reconstruction, program;




                                           35
Benefits from additional economic activities, through multiplier effect, resulting from
linked businesses including suppliers of construction goods and services , other operating
inputs and employment opportunities created in the services sector including
transportation and sales;

Psychological and social value of having a decent home

This analysis accounted for the benefits listed under (a), (b), and (c). However, we have
not attempted economic valuation of the /quantification of the psychological and social
value of having a decent home, which is high in Sri Lanka.

Methodology and assumptions

We have made the following assumptions for valuation of the economic benefits from the
housing component of the project:

Value of new and reconstructed houses: The project facilitated construction of new
houses and reconstruction of the thatched houses. In the case of the new houses the asset
value of the houses constructed is accounted as the direct benefit. Similarly, in the case
of reconstructed houses, the value added due to reconstruction is accounted as the direct
benefit from the project. Based on discussions with the project engineers and the
households, the average asset values of a new house and the value added of a
reconstructed house are estimated at Rs. 600 and Rs. 400 thousands respectively and are
used to estimate the aggregate value of the houses constructed/reconstructed. In addition,
it is assumed that the values of the houses constructed appreciate over time in the project
area at an annual rate of 6 percent.

Multiplier impacts of wage income of construction workers and the additional economic
activities as a result of the housing reconstruction program: In order to compute the
multiplier impacts of wage income and construction expenditures a multiplier of 1.4 was
used in this analysis. 7

Economic efficiency and sensitivity analysis

The analysis relates the project costs (Table 2) to the economic value stream of benefits
from the investment in housing. The benefits stream included the value of new and
reconstructed houses with the project, economy-wide multiplier impacts of wage incomes
of construction expenditures, increase in wage incomes as a result of improved skills of
trained workers trained as part of the project and the appreciation in values of the new
and reconstructed houses. In addition to the appreciation in value of the houses, as


7
  The multiplier was arrived at as 1/(1-x*y*z) where x is the percentage of new income the consumer and business
wouldspend; y is the percentage of consumer expenditures made in the state/region; and z is the percentage of business
expenditure made in the state/region. We have assumed that the values of x, y and z to be 0.8, 0.9 and 0.4 respectively

                                                         36
discussed above as a result of the training imparted, the construction workers would earn
increased wage incomes from their improved skills. It is assumed that these trained
workers would earn additional wage incomes for the next 15 years of their productive life.
The net present value and the Benefit: Cost ratios based on the cost stream and the
estimated benefit stream from the housing component of the project and are presented in

The above table shows that the project yielded modest returns measured in terms of
Benefit: Cost ratio and Net Present Value of cost and benefit streams. At 8% rate of
interest and 4 percent appreciation in house values 8, the Benefit: Cost ratio was 3.75,
which implies that a dollar invested in the housing component yielded $3.75 as returns.
The Net Present Value at 8% interest rate was Rs. 6,096 Million.

The ICR team could not identify significant risks to affect the outcomes and the benefits
from the housing sector investment. However, we have conducted sensitivity of the
results to 2 percent and 6 percent appreciations in house values at different 10 and 12
percent interest rates (Table 2). The sensitivity analysis showed that even at 12 percent
interest rate and 2 percent appreciation in house values, the investment would yield
Benefit: Cost ratio of 1.78 and net present value of Rs. 3168 million. The above results
are in agreement with the results of the ex-ante economic analysis conducted at the time
of project preparation.

Water and sanitation component

Costs and outputs of water and sanitation component

The water subcomponent included provision for improved water connections to 6,121
households that benefited 27,545 beneficiaries. The sanitation sub-component included
construction of improved latrines as part of the new and reconstructed houses. Thus
improved latrines were constructed for 6934 new and reconstructed houses. This
component also facilitated construction of 1669 latrines as part of the sanitation grant to

  Based on discussion with the project staff we have assumed that a 4 percent appreciation in house values is normal for
the new and reconstructed houses in the project area.

In addition to the sanitation assistance to the IDPs to construct latrines the project also
facilitated construction of latrines for the 5441 new houses and 1493 reconstructed
houses.

Benefits of the water and sanitation program

The benefits of improvements in water and sanitation include:

Health sector benefit due to avoided illness: The health sector benefits are reduced
expenditure and thus savings in treatment of diarrhea disease and value of less health
workers falling sick with diarrhea.

Patient expenses avoided due to avoided illness: The savings in patient expenses include
both direct and indirect savings. The direct benefits are savings in expenditure on
treatment of diarrhea disease and related costs, reduced expenditure on transport in
seeking treatment and less time lost due to treatment seeking. The indirect benefits
include value of avoided days lost at work or at school, value of avoided time lost of
parent/caretaker of sick children, value of losses from death avoided.

Benefits to the consumer: the benefits to the consumer of water and sanitation services
include value of time savings due to access to water and sanitation and possible other
indirect benefits like household switch away from more expensive water sources,
increase in property value, value of leisure activities and benefits to tourism sector.

In order to estimate the benefits from improved water and sanitation we have used the
parameter estimates from the study on benefits from providing access to water and
sanitation in Sri Lanka conducted by the World Health Organization (WHO) 9. The above

using the consumer price indices for Sri Lanka.

Economic efficiency and sensitivity analysis

The analysis of the economic efficiency is based on the costs and outputs presented in
Table 5 and the estimated of benefit parameters presented in Table 5. The benefits
include treatment costs saved by the patient and the health sector from reduced incidence
of water borne diseases, value of annual time savings from reduced incidence of water
borne diseases, time saved for collecting water in the absence of water services provided
by the project, value of averted deaths and other benefits. The water infrastructure is
assumed to have an annual maintenance costs at 10 percent of the project costs and a life
of 20 years.

The above table shows that the water and sanitation services component yielded modest
returns measured in terms of Benefit: Cost ratio and Net Present Value of cost and benefit
streams. At 8% rate of interest the Benefit: Cost ratio was 2.3, which implies that a dollar
invested in the project yielded $2.3 as returns. At a higher discount rate of 12 percent the
project returned a Benefit: Cost ratio of 1.87.

The ICR team could not identify significant risks that affect the outcomes and the
benefits from the water and sanitation component. Hence, we have only conducted
sensitivity of the results to different discount rates. The analysis showed that even at a
discount rate of 12 percent the project yielded a commendable Benefit: Cost ratio of 1.87.
The above results are in agreement with the results of the ex-ante economic analysis
conducted at the time of project preparation.

Conclusions

The PHP had four components. Among the four components, economic analysis was
done only for the housing component and the water & sanitation component. The results
showed that both the above components yielded significant returns to investment. In the
case of the housing component, it may be noted that the analysis did not include the
psychological and social value of owning a decent home as such values could not easily
be quantified. Such social values could be high in a country like Sri Lanka that has long
been affected by internal conflict and populations have been internally displaced for long
periods of time. In the case of the housing component, the main project benefit was
creation of private assets in the form of reconstructed houses whose values appreciate
over time. The possible risks include resumption of conflict and the loss of values, the
chances of which is which are very negligible. In the case of the water and sanitation
services component, the project benefits are mostly health benefits and the savings in
time. The results of this analysis are in agreement with the ex-ante measures of project
worth and provide further evidence of productive returns to investment in reconstruction
of houses and water & sanitation services in the area that was affected by internal conflict.

1.0 Project Development Objective

The PHP would help integrate the Puttalam Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) in their
preferred location of choice through housing, water, road, sanitation and environmental
mitigation and help upgrade habitat and contribute to the socio-economic integration of
IDPs and Non-IDPs. Specifically, the PHP would:

   •   Provide 5653 new houses to replace temporary thatched huts and completing of
       2232 partially completed houses;
   •   Provide safe drinking water facilities to 13,584 IDP families and 3291 Non-IDP
       families;
   •   Provide 2000 toilets to IDPs and Non-IDPs who are eligible; and
   •   Environment mitigation and road improvement in welfare centers to safeguard the
       environmental risks that were a result of flooding and lack of proper drainage.

Components

To achieve these objectives, the PHP focused on the implementation of components
comprising of housing, water, roads, sanitation and environment mitigation as to promote
living standards of IDPs as well as host community living around the welfare centers.

Component One: Housing Assistance (U$ 16.1 million). This component was to
finance housing construction across the 141 refugee camps in Puttalam in proportion to
the housing demand. The Puttalam Project Unit (PPU) ranked refugee camps using three
social criteria, i.e., (i) percentage of temporary thatched houses in each camp; (ii)
percentage of IDP households who possessed land in each camp; and (iii) percentage of
households that opted to settle in Puttalam as recorded in the UNHCR supervised census
of IDPs living in refugee camps in Puttalam in 2006 The project was based upon the
home-owner driven construction. The provision of cash grants would ensure beneficiary
participation in the construction of their houses, facilitated increased choice in house
design and use of construction materials and reduced cost of construction.

Component Two: Water, Sanitation, Environment Mitigation, and Settlement Plans
(US$ 15.9 million). This component aimed at upgrading IDP camps into sustainable
habitats with clean and safe drinking water, better sanitation and improved living
conditions in Puttalam.6 The project would also provide water and sanitation in certain
adjoining and vulnerable non-IDP villages to mitigate potential non-IDP resentment at
the transfer of resources to IDPs.

Component Three: Technical Support for Implementation (US$ 785,000). This
component aimed at supporting project implementation through a series of technical
assistance activities. It would support the regularization of land titles, a communications
campaign, a continuous social impact assessment, mid-term and prior-to-closing




                                            44
environmental audits, a third party technical audit, a housing assessment survey, and
skills training.

Component Four: Project Management (US$ 1.34 million). This component would
support the implementation of the project at all levels. It would facilitate project
management activities at the MOR to manage and monitor the PHP, support the district
administration to ensure proper implementation of the PHP at the district and divisions’
level. The activities to be financed would include staff expenses, incremental operating
costs that include travel, transport, fuel, food, lodging but not salaries, training of project
related staff, and the procurement of goods that includes office equipment, two vehicles,
bicycles, and motor cycles.

To achieve the said objectives, the kind of activities targeted included physical
intervention such as enhancing the communities to take up the challenge to build the
houses under the home owners driven program.

The following measures were undertaken during the housing support grant:

    •   Housing Assessment Survey
    •   Regularization of land titles
    •   Communication campaign
    •   Continues Social Impact Assessment
    •   Comprehensive Settlement Plan
    •   Environmental Management Plan
    •   Technical Audit of housing construction
    •   100% Beneficiary Audit
    •   Skills Training for construction labor

Housing Assessment Survey. A Housing Assessment Survey revalidated the household
profile, the classification of houses and lands and ensured 100% solid proof of ownership
of the land, which complied with the results of the UNHCR census.

Regularization of land titles. A unit was formed with land officers in the PHP who
reviewed, regularized land titles with the assistance of the land task force and provided
adequate documentation regarding the lands and resolved land disputes among the
beneficiaries and the government.

Communication campaign. A Communication Campaign conducted by the PHP
targeted the communities of all categories such as beneficiaries, Mosque committee,
Village Rehabilitation Committee and other stakeholders. Through the communication
campaign unit the PHP initiated the establishment of the Village Rehabilitation
Committees (VRC) and the Community Base Organizations (CBO) that facilitated
implementation of the project. The unit utilized various media such as printing materials
and TV telecasts to reach out to vulnerable groups in the IDP camps. Among the topics
covered through the communication campaign were programs on water conservation and



                                              45
uses, environment management, hygiene education, discussions on excavating drains and
laying culverts in road construction within the camps.

Continuous social Impact assessment. This activity was a major part in the process of
implementation. It was used to monitor community perceptions, grievances and feedback
on project implementation. The findings in this process would benefit the PHP to go the
right direction and discusses the social dimension of the beneficiaries as well as PHP.
Findings provided facts on social disturbances, conflicts, socio economic status and
integration between IDPs and Non-IDP. The CSIA proved to identify the necessary
solutions needed for successful implementation of the project. The PPU outsourced the
CSIA for 3 years and thereafter. The PHP social team undertook this task.

Comprehensive settlement Plan. The PHP helped to prepare survey plans and
comprehensive settlement plans. These plans guided the planned development and
implementation of basic building regulations in each camp and to structure the
development of essential community services, recommended appropriate mitigation
measures, road improvement work and regularization of IDP camps for sustainable
system for maintenance management.

Environment Management Plans (EMPs). Prepared EMP reports on camps. These
recommended appropriate mitigation measures to reduce environmental hazards.

Technical Audit. A Third party Technical Audit for quality assurance was carried out to
assure that the construction complied with agreed technical standards. It audited a 10%
sample of beneficiaries’ in camps. The recommendations fed into ongoing construction
and subsequent rounds of project supervision.

100% Beneficiary audit. This ensured compliance with agreed selection criteria with
reference to recipients of housing support cash grant. It included criteria for receiving a
full housing grant or a partial housing grant as defined in the PAD.

Skill Training for construction labors. Training was provided to 300 masons and 200
carpenters identified in the beneficiary families as well as host communities around the
camp. Training was provided to address the shortage of labors in the construction of
houses in Puttalam. Training was provided to every trained person to build their own
house as well as work on the other houses.

3.0.   Factors Affecting Implementation

The factors which are affected the implementation, include:

•   Weak capacity of the IDPs to implement and to monitor the housing construction
    process. This was the case particularly for the widowed and disabled beneficiaries.
•   Sometimes tensions occurred between the IDPs and the host communities. Especially
    before the housing component was extended to include poor non-IDP beneficiaries.




                                             46
•     Delayed completion of houses, attributed to several factors, such as escalation in costs
      of housing materials, some IDPs undertook overly ambitious housing plans,
      complications in securing construction materials due to tensions between transporters
      and hosts in communities where materials were extracted.

4.0      Risks for sustainability

      (i) Poor maintenance of water supply systems
      (ii) Weak institutional capacity of the CBOs to sustain the water systems
      (iii)Weak institutional framework for sustainability of roads and drainage investments.

5. The World Bank performance

World Bank team fielded number of supervision missions to the project. This supervision
missions made it possible to meet with all stakeholders, such as representatives from the
consultancy services, partner organizations (POs), and all beneficiaries. The mission
teams regularly discussed with the PHP team and provided assistance to deal with the
issues in project implementation.

7.0      Borrower’s Performance

This project had valued services rendered for housing, water, road, sanitation and
environmental mitigation by several experienced institutions, including Ministry of
Resettlement, NWSDB, Provincial Road Development Department, Partner organizations,
CEB, Human Development Organization (HDO) and VASON .

8.0      Lesson learned in the process of the project;

Project planning

•     Project objectives were specific and measurable and attainable
•     Project design and schedule of activities were well documented with appropriate
      structure and details
•     Stakeholders had appropriate input into the project planning process
•     Sufficient details were adequately gathered and documented.
•     Project budget was well defined and appropriately used
•     Criteria were clear for all project components
•     Stake holders had easy access to the project plan

Project execution

•     Project stuck to its Original Objectives
•     Design changes well controlled project tracked progress against the original base of
      the project and reported status report procurement conducted smoothly without
      hindrances




                                              47
•   Contractors provided acceptable deliverables of appropriate quality on time satisfied
    with proposed budget.
•   The project had adequate quality control risk and challenged well managed.

Human factors

•   PMU reported appropriated part of the Organization and the project.
•   PMU was well effective
•   Project team was effective and experience
•   Project team effectively works with beneficiaries and had good communications
•   resources were well committed to project aims

Overall of the project

•   Initial cost and schedule estimate were accurate
•   Deliverables was within the estimate
•   Overall change was controlled and effective
•   External dependencies were well understood and well managed
•   Technology chosen was appropriate and technological success
•   Beneficiaries needs were identified and were met successfully

Risk identified in the project

Exclusion of some of the IDP camps that are located in environmentally unsuitable sites
from the project. Even though, the Government of Sri Lanka has agreed to design a
separate program for the relocation of such settlements, the possible institutional
delays and difficulties to implement timely relocation of these settlements.


Institutional Risk. The implementation progress was slow due to the lack of lack of
institutional capacity in the management of development programs and poor
understanding of the World Bank operational procedures, safeguard requirements and
financial management and reporting systems.

Operational risk due to weak empowerment of CBOs. The political and social divide
between the refugees and host communities also impacted the smooth implementation of
the project.

Risk on land ownership. One of the clear risks was the ‘exclusion’ of some of the
neediest families due to lack of land ownership.

Lesson learned in project implementation

•   “Owner Driven? housing construction program was recognized by the PHP as the
    most preferred strategic option only most vulnerable families ‘prefer’ to any other
    POs to build the houses.



                                            48
•   Better coordination of the PHP activities by the various stakeholders engaged in the
    implementation.
•   Close monitoring of the PHP components was a challenge. It required close
    coordination with the beneficiaries, project team and other stakeholders.
•   Securing raw materials for construction was a challenge
•   Need for continuous capacity building on sustaining water investments
•   Continuous training on hygienic practices
