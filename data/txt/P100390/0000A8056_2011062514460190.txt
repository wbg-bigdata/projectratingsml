                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The revised project development objective of the PHP is to support the integration of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) in Puttalam by providing housing,
                         drinking water, and sanitation facilities to both IDPs and a limited number of select non-IDPs in host communities, and rehabilitate selected internal roads in the
                         IDP Welfare centers. The PHP would support the construction of about 4,350 new houses to replace the temporary thatched huts, as well as the completion of
                         approximately 2,232 partly-completed houses in the refugee camps and about 600 temporary houses in the host communities for non-IDPs in Puttalarn. These
                         interventions would help upgrade habitat and contribute to the socio-economic integration of IDPs and non-IDPs.

                         2010, the number of beneficiaries completing their houses significantly increased, with over 3,500 IDP houses (79% of target) were fully completed as of May 2011 and about 93% of
                         balance IDP beneficiaries received 6th installment (out of 7 installments) to complete their houses. The non-IDP housing component also had started and all 541 target houses are

                         under construction, with 52% and 22% received 6th and 7th installments, respectively and 120 houses were fully completed.

                         Infrastructure:
                         There are 12 water supply (WS) schemes under this project. Three WS schemes (Kandakuliya, Palliwasturai & Thihaly) have been completed and 1,955 water points provided to the
                         beneficiaries. 5 water supply contract packages were awarded and physical work is under way with good progress. These 5 schemes upon completion provide over 4,000 water
                         points to the beneficiaries both in IDP camps and selected villages in host communities. The mission requested the Ministry of Resettlement to get early provision of electricity to all
                         WS schemes to ensure timely operations. For the remainder 4 schemes (Karambe, Kalapitiya, Mundel, and Erukalampitya) where no nearby feasible water sources have been
                          found, NWSDB has prepared alternative proposals which yet to be decided by the government as to whether they are feasible to implement under this project.

                         Contracts have been awarded for three road packages (Kandakuliya & Palliwasalthuray, Kalapitiya and Mundel). Bids for two packages (Hidayath Nagar and Karambe) are under
                         evaluation and expected to be awarded soon; and five road packages (Wattakandal, Alankuda, Norochola, Mudallapaly, Puttalam) are under various stages of bidding process ready
                         to be awarded soon.

                         Sanitation component of the project is under implementation with good progress. About 1,546 beneficiaries were identified (896 IDP families, 300 non-IDP families, and 350 units in
                         common places like schools, nurseries, worship areas, health centers, etc.). Of this, a total of 1,279 grants have been given (Rs. 25,000 per beneficiary) and work is underway. 472
                         units have been completed.
