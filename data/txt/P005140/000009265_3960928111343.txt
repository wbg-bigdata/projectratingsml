MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT
FOR AN ENGINEERING AND TECINICAL EDUCATION PROJECT
1.       I submit for approval the following memorandum and recommendation on
a proposed loan to Egypt for US$30.5 million equivalent. The proposed loan
would be for 20 years, including a five-year grace period, at the standard
variable interest rate linked to the borrowing costs of the Bank, and would
help finance an Engineering and Technical Education Project.
2.       Background. The Egyptian economy expanded rapidly in the 1970s
after several years of economic stagnation. However, events in the 1980s led
to an economic slowdown, precipitated by the collapse of world oil prices in
1986 and the leveling off of worker remittances and foreiga aid.  Against
prospects of slower growth and scarce resources, the 1988-92 Development Plan
has outlined an adjustment program emphasizing the need tn increase production
and improve productivity through modernizing production technology and
accompanying investments in human capital. The Plan recognizes that the
removal of human resource constraints is a critical element in the strategy
adopted and calls for a greater emphasis on technology-oriented education to
meet the expanding skill needs of the manufacturing sector.
3.       The economic recession has reinforced the need to shift the emphasis
in human resources development from expanding general education to improving
the quality and occupational relevance of professiondi and technical
education. At the same time, however, the unfavorable economic situation has
made it increasingly difficult for the Government to sustain past levels of
education expenditures. improvements in quality have, therefore, lagged
behind quantitative expansion. Most engineering faculties have become
overc-owded with inadequate financial, physical and human resources to ensure
adequate learning conditions. Furthermore, the absence of industrial links
have prevented most engineering programs from adapting their curricula to the
changing technological needs of the production sectors; engineers rarely
receive the kind of training and practical experience sought by industry.
Similarly, the quality of training in technical education is adversely
affected by che lack of appropriate facilities, equipment and curricula, and
the crucial shortage of technical teachers. Meanwhile, the present approach
to teacher training and deployment remains outmoded due to an unwarranted
separation between the teaching of theory and practice.
4.       To support improvements in the quality of engineering education, the
Ministry of Higher Education has decreased enrollments in existing faculties
of engineering and mobilized additional financial resources to complement
public funds. Faculties of engineering have introduced users' charges for
laboratory and computer classes and have started implementing applied research
agreements with industry. To give engineering graduates a more practical
orientation and better aptitudes for technological innovation, the Government



has adopted a dual strategy involving the reforming and upgrading of a number
of existing faculties of enginieering to give them a more applied and
industrial emphasis and the transformation of a two-year technical institute
in Benha into a Higher Institute of Technology to train techlologists in
disciplines not offered at tthe university.  The strategy to improve secondary
and post-secondary technical education involves re-defining the role and
mission of technical education on the basis of a realistic assessment of
present and future labor market needs, taking into account the relative
cost-effectiveness of different modes of delivery of vocational education
programs. The quality of tec'nical education will be enhanced by providing
better qualified teachers in sufficient numbers, reforming curricula,
upgrading existing schools and institutes and mobilizing additional resources
through users' charges and production work. To carry out this comprehensive
strategy, the MOE/MOHE would receive support from the African Development
Bank/Fund to finance modern equipment for the secondary technical schools.
The World Bank's role would be to improve the supply of engineering
specialists with relevant knowledge and experience, initiate a reform of
technical teacher training, and implement appropriate reforms in the technical
education system to provide a more efficient pedagogical environment for the
new teachers. With respect to the latter point, a strategy has been defined
to train theory-cum-practice technical teachers by merging the existing
five-year teacher training schools and university industrial education
departments into new technical teacher colleges for pre-service and in-service
training.
5.       Rationale for Bank lnvolvement.  The Bank's lending strategy in Egypt
is to help the Government restore macroeconomic balance and promote sectoral
growth through economic reforms and increases in productivity, supported by
improvements in the supply of professional and technical manpower. Bank
involvement in enginieering and technical education, which is in line with the
Government's manpower development strategy, meets this objective. Bank
assistance would focus on improving the quality and relevance of the existing
faculties of engineering and on supporting the technical teacher education
reform within the context of policies to increase the efficiency and
cost-effectiveness of secondary and post-secondary technical education.
6.       Project Objectives.  The proposed project focuses on strengthening
Egypt's engineering and technical education under the Ministry of Higher
Education. The objectives of the proposed project are: (a) to improve the
quality and occupational relevance of university engineering education; and
(b) to improve the quality of secondary and post-secondary technical education
by supporting the development of a new, more appropriate, type of technical
teacher education system which, in the longer term, would enable meeting
increasing demands for well-qualified teachers.
7.       Project Description. To achieve these objectives, the project would
comprise the following components:
(a)  an Engineering Education Development Program to upgrade facilities,
laboratory equipment, instructional materials, and provide technical
assistance to move existing university engineering faculties toward a
more applied orientation through stronger linkages with industry,
more relevant curricula and methods better qualified teaching staff;
and



- 3 -
(b)  a Technical Teacher Education Program providing instructional
equipment and technical assistance to initiate a new system for the
professional preparation of high quality theory-cum-practice teachers
for secondary and post-secondary technical schools and institutes by
establishing two new technical teacher training colleges.
8.       Project Costs and Financing. The total cost of the proposed project,
to be implemented over a six-year period, is estimated at US$38.6 million
equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$30.5 million (79X). The
Bank would finance the foreign exchange component of the proposed project. A
breakdown of the costs and financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts
and methods oi procurement and disbursement are shown in Schedule B. A
timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in Egypt are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A Staff
Appraisal Report No. 7996-EGT of October 23, 1989 is also attached.
9.       Actions Agreed.  During negotiations, the Government provided
assurances that: (a) it would establish the Board of the Cairo Industrial
Education College by May 1990 with adequate representation from the Ministry
of Education; (b) it would implement, to the satisfaction of the Bank, the
policy measures and transition arrangements outlined in the technical teacher
reform action plan; (c) it would prepare and implement a plan acceptable to
the Bank for in-service training, at the Colleges, of existing theory teachers
and workshop intructors in the technical schools and institutes; (d) the
Colleges would offer their teaching staff a system of remuneration similar to
the one used at the Benha Institute of Technology; (e) appraisal and approval
of the content, procedures and criteria for the subprojects will be made in
accordance with the engineering education development program agreed with the
Bank; (f) the engineering education development program would be managed by
the bodies and would be substantially -.n agreement with the provisions set
forth in the loan agreement; and (g) the faculties of engineering would
provide sufficient funds, as defined in the schedule agreed between the Bank
and the Government, to repienish the laboratory facilities and equipment
maintenance program supported by the project.
.10.     Benefits.  The proposed project is expected to yield very significant
economic benefits. By supporting the strengthening of engineering and
technical education, it would make a major contribution to Egypt's manpower
training efforts aimed at increasing productivity in the economy and expanding
export-oriented industries. Improvement in the quality and job relevance of
engineering education would enable the universities to more adequotely meet
the needs of the economy, as technology-intensive companies would benefit
greatly from better quality engineering 6raduates with appropriate industrial
knowledge and practical experience. Through better quaJified technical
teachers with instructional competence in both theory and practice, the
project would increase the quality and relevance of secondary and post-
secondary technical education, thus improving the technical educetion system's
ability to produce well-trained skilled technicians and workers.

I1.      Risk.  The principal rigk aggociated with tel  engineering education
development component is that the inore advanced faculties of engineering would
be in a better position to competo and qualify for project support. To reduce
this risk and address equity concerns, the proposed project would include a
sub-project proparation facility to aggist individual faculties in the
preparation of proposals for submission under the program, especially those
facultioe which are less experienced in project formulation and international
cooperation. As far as the technical teacher education component is
concerned, the existing salary scale for teaching staff is so low that the new
Colleges might have difficulty attracting and retaining teacher trainers with
appropriate qualifications. This risk would be addressed by establishing an
incentives system under a special status applicable only to a limited number
of post-secondary institutes such as the new Benha Higher Institute of
Technology. This would enable the College ma agement to recruit and keep
qualified professionals with wide practical experience. There is also a risk
that, during the transition phase, the training of technical teachers
competent in both theory and practice would not be fully synchronized with the
reform of the existing system which relies on different teachers for theory
and for workshop instruction. This risk would be minimized by careful
planning of the transition phase and by arranging for the new trained teachers
(pre-service and in-service graduates) to be allocated only to technical
schools with reformed curricula.
12.      Reoommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
