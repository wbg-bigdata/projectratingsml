I. THE ENERGY SECTOR
A.   INTRODUCTION
1.01      Crude oil is the dominant source of energy in Peru, supplying
approximately 80% of Peru's commercial energy requirements. Although Peru's
energy resource base is relatively diverse and there is scope for expanding
the role of hydropower and coal in future electricity generation, petroleum
will still provide the major part of Peru's energy requirements throughout
the rest of this century. After being dependent on imported crude oil for
many years to meet its petroleum needs, domestic oil production increased
almost threefold between 1976 and 1979, enabling Peru to export oil in sub-
stantial quantities for the first time since 1958. Despite this encouraging
production trend, domestic consumption is likely to rebound after several
years of stagnation so that Perti's continued ability to meet its domestic
oil requirements beyond the early 1980s is far from assured unless new oil
reserves are discovered and existing production is maintained to the extent
feasible.
1.02      As a consequence, the Government's strategy in addressing Peru's
future energy needs must focus on ways to increase petroleum production
through exploration and development while at the same time restraining the
growth in demand for petroleum. Exploration, particularly in the Amazon
basin will require considerably more resources and technical expertise
than the Government can be expected to provide during the next decade; it
will therefore require a policy that will attract substantial amounts of
risk capital over an extended period from foreign oil companies. At the
same time, the Government should complement its efforts in attracting
exploration investment by adopting pricing policies which take into account
the need to replace petroleum by other energy sources, and which set the
prices of petroleum products at levels which encourage their efficient use
in the industrial and transport sectors.
1.03      The following paragraphs present a brief description of the hydro,
gas, coal and other energy sources along with a discussion of the anticipated
energy use patterns through the end of the century. Section II will treat the
petroleum sector in a more detailed manner.
B.   RESOURCE BASE
1.04      Peru's resource base is diverse.  In addition to known (proved and
probable) oil reserves of about one billion barrels (140 million tons - TOE)
and estimated undiscovered reserves of from two to twenty billion barrels,
Peru has potentially economically viable hydroelectric sites which have a
capability of generating an estimated 30 to 60 GW of which only 1.4 GW
are currently being used. It also has coal reserves estimated at about one
billion tons (660 million TOE) which are almost completely unutilized, and
some potential geothermal sites. However, gas reserves are small; estimates
range from one to two trillion cubic feet (28-56 million TOE).



-2-
Hydropower
1.05      With an average growth rate since 1965 of 7.3%, hydropower is, over
the long term, the most rapidly growing energy sector in Peru (see Annex 1.01
for details). TJhile accounting for only 6% of total energy usage (9% of
commercial energy production) its potential for continued growth is enormous,
as current capacity, about 1400 MW, is less than 3% of the country's estimated
economically viable hydropotential. In fact, on the basis of projects under
construction and on the drawing boards, it would be possible to increase
capacity to 3400 NW by 1990, corresponding to an average annual growth rate
of 7.5%.
1.06      While additional hydropower sites are available, only 15% of poten-
tial sites are on the Pacific side of the Andes. New large scale hydropower
projects will, therefore, be quite expensive, since they will require addi-
tional expenditures on by pass tunnels or long distance high voltage trans-
mission lines. Furthermore, development of the best sites for large dams
would result in flooding of intensively cultivated valleys which could make
them socially and economically unacceptable. Mini-hydroplants serving a local
market might however be a viable alternative to diesel electricity generating
plants in many regions, and the government is actively promoting this alterna-
tive for more isolated mountain villages.
Natural Gas
1.07      Natural gas is not an important contributor to Peru's energy needs.
It is produced primarily in the northwestern coastal oil-producing areas
around Talara, where it is used primarily as a fertilizer feedstock rather
than as a direct energy source.  Output over the past decade has ranged from
77 billion cubic feet (bcf) in 1969 to 65 bef in 1975, and is expected to
remain at 70 to 72 bcf per year for the next five years (about 14 million bbl
oil equivalent) even though some declines in existing fields can be expected
as a result of water flooding for secondary oil recovery operations in the
Talara area.
1.08      Although some sizeable gas fields have been discovered in the
Amazon region, they are not large enough to justify the cost of a pipeline
from their isolated locations to potential consumption centers. Most of the
oil fields produce only small quantities of gas which is used for local fuel
requirements, with the remainder reinjected to provide additional lift.
Besides the Amazon, the only other area with considerable potential is in the
offshore Progreso Basin; however, most of the potential producing areas of
this basin lie on the Ecuadorian side of this basin.
Coal
1.09      Coal is Peru's least exploited energy resource; current production
accounting for less than one percent of total energy consumption. However,
at least four known fields hold considerable potential as supply sources for
thermal power plants and metallurgical grade coke. The Government is currently



- 3 -
studying investing in a 480 megawatt power station at one of these sites,
which, based on the limited geological work undertaken at this time, has
a total reserve (proven, probable and possible) of 270 million tons (170
million TOE). The cost of such an investment program would be oln the order
of $300 million (in 1978 prices), and the lead time five to ten years.
1.10      Information on coal formations in other parts of the country is
somewhat sketchy to permit an adequate judgement about whether or not economic
deposits exist. However, in a number of regions general geological conditions
appear favorable and may have given rise to coal beds that were :Ln an earlier
geologic age continuous over many hundreds of square kilometers. Additional
exploration and proving up of known deposits should be a high priority of the
GOP.
Nuclear Fuel
1.11      OnLly a limited amount of exploration has yet been undertaken for
Uranium, mostly in the 1960's, and no exploitable concentrates of this mineral
has been found.
Geothermal
1.12      Peru has no proven geothermal energy reserves.  It has, however,
numerous warm and boiling springs in many parts of the country. The Govern-
ment is only now beginning to study its geothermal resources. Data on thermal
gradients and heat flow is, as a result, still insufficient to estimate the
inferred reserves. Based on the properties of the many known hot springs,
the broad geological characteristics of the country, and the analogy with the
proven geothermal energy reserves in Northern Chile, total inferred reserves
are on the order of 400 MW hours, while speculative reserves are put at some
20 times more than inferred.
Non-Commerc:ial Fuels
1.13      Non-commercial fuels - wood and other residual vegetable matter -
accounted for one third of Peru's total energy usage in 1976. They were the
major fuel source for household cooking needs, accounting for 70% of all
residential and commercial energy consumption in 1976, down from 75% in 1965
(see Annex 1.02). Consumption in this period grew by less than 1% per year.
In 1972, 75% of the rural population used wood as their primary energy
source, whiLe another 16% used other secondary vegetable sources. In urban
centers, kerosene is the most important cooking fuel, being used by 58% of
the population with wood being used by about 19%.
C.   PATTERNS OF FUTIJRE ENERGY CONSUMPTION
1.14      Available figures for 1976 indicate a total energy consumption
equivalent to 75 milLion barrels of oil (10.6 million TOE), of which oil
accounts for 54%, firewood 27%, hydropower 6%, natural gas 5%, coal 0.5% and
other noncommerical sources 6.5%. While Peru will continue to be heavily
dependent on petroleum for its energy needs throughout most of this century,



- 4 -
there is some prospect that the rapid growth of both hydroelectric and
thermal electric coal based power stations could reduce petroleum's share to
about half of the country's total energy requirements by the year 2000. In
the medium term, however, conservation measures will have the most important
influence on the country's overall energy situation.
1.15      On the basis of current trends and current known reserves, Peru
is expected to continue to have a small overall petroleum surplus available
for export through 1983. Whether Peru will remain a net petroleum exporter
throughout the 1980s, however, will depend primarily on the level of explor-
atory work and resultant discoveries in the Amazon region, where most of the
as yet undiscovered reserves are expected to be found. Since Peru does not
have adequate resources to undertake a major exploratory program at this time,
the GOP's strategy is to rely primarily on foreign oil companies for the
exploration and development of indigenous oil resources, particularly in the
Amazon basin, and to develop hydropower, coal and thermal resources in order
to avoid increasing the country's dependence on oil.
1.16      Major shifts in the sectoral usage of energy are likely to take
place during the next two decades. Preliminary projections indicate that
if there is no radical change in energy sector policy, as might be expected,
the transport sector will continue to increase its share in petroleum usage,
from about 44% presently to about 48% by the end of the century, while indus-
try and agriculture will decrease their direct usage from 34% to about 27%.
Petroleum usage for electricity generation will also have to increase to make
up for short term shortfalls in the growth of hydro and coal fired power
stations, particularly in regions not connected to the major national grids.
As a result, by 1985 oil consumption for electricity production will increase
from about 9 to 14% before falling off to 11% by the turn of the century.
It is also projected that, although most of the increase in coal production
will take place after 1985, by the year 2000 coal will account for 30% of
the electricity produced in the thermal plants. Annex 1.04 provides some
estimates for the pattern of energy consumption by source and sector that may
emerge assuming that no new policy directives are initiated to expand the use
of hydro and coal fired thermal power plants above currently planned levels.
D.   ENERGY SECTOR PLANNING AND POLICIES
1.17      The Ministry of Energy and Mines (MEM) is assigned the responsi-
bility for coordinating all energy planning activities. Operational respon-
sibility is divided between the various semi-independent bodies responsible
for the subsectors. ELECTROPERU, the national power company, is responsible
for electric power generation and distribution. PETROPERU, the parastatal
oil company, is responsible for all phases of production and distribution of
petroleum and petroleum products. Two other companies are currently active
in Peru; Occidental Petroleum, an independent US based company, is the most
important, with a successful exploration and development program in the
Amazon, and a smaller secondary recovery program in Talara. Belco, a smaller
US based company, has been active in offshore primary and secondary recovery
programs for about 20 years; its production is about one fourth that of
Occidental's. Both companies have production sharing contracts with PETROPERU.

1.18      The M4EM has had the advatL,age ci a natiunal energy bala.nce atudy
(prepared in cooperation with tba  i4..ri tsy a UMited Natict s p:roject team
working in the Office of Sectoxial              ajr: ri,} sn  a major hydroelectric pover
planning exercise, prepared by Lahmt,!y, ntei LiAticnal as part oi a Republic
of Germany grant and funds from Batk s most recett power loan (1;215-PE). This
survey's conclusions, which should become available in 1980, wilL be used in
the preparation of a power sector master plan to determine an optimal sequence
for investment in new generating and transmission facilities. In addition, in
1978, a US team under the management of the US Department of Energy undertook
an assessment of Peru's energy resources and planning in collaboration with
Peruvian energy managers. This binational group assessed Peru's energy
resources, and supply and demand options to the year 2000, and suggested some
alternative energy strategies for the country.
1.19      The U.S. Report recommended that the Government strategy focus on
ways to maximize the production of oil and on ways to minimize its consumption.
The latter objective could be accomplished by: (i) developing hydroelectric
and coal energy sources; (ii) shifting towards renewable energy resources
where possible, particularly small scale hydroelectric, geothermal, and
biomass plants for the smaller isolated communities; (iii) improving energy
efficiency in industry; and (iv) electrification where possible of urban and
regional transport systems, which by 2000 are projected to account for almost
50% of national oil consumption, to minimize energy costs. Nuclear power was
not considered as a viable option, at least before the year 2000.  This new
emphasis on coal and renewable resources in addition to the continued emphasis
on the development oi- the petroleum sector, will play an important role in
Peru's multi dimensional energy program. There may be scope for a program of
small scale hydropower facilities tied to rural development projects, as well
as for a program for rapidly evaluating the country's coal poten,tial.
1.20      With the completion of this latest energy study and arn increasing
awareness on the parit of the government of the importance of energy planning
in helping formulate a coherent energy strategy for Peru to the year 2000,
consideration is being given to strengthening the capabilities of the
existing government lbodies currently responsible for planning in the sector.
One proposal to achieve this objective which is under discussion is establish-
ing an "energy institute" which would help coordinate the various facets of
government policy, particularly in regard to energy demand management and
conservation measures which do not receive adequate attention at: present;
such an "institute" could play a critical advisory role to senior government
policy makers. At this juncture, the setting up of such an inst:itute is
still at an embrionic stage.  While such an "institute" or a similar entity,
may warrant Bank assistance in the future, its short-term financing needs are
likely to bie met through grants from entities such as UNDP and firom private
foundations, as well as possibly from government budgetary sources.



- 6 -
1.21      The core of a successful energy program for Peru, however, is the
implementation of its petroleum development strategy. The Bank's involvement
in the petroleum sector as a result of the proposed loan will allow it to
establish a dialogue with the Government on the implementation of this
strategy; this in turn, will help create the continuous and stable policy
frame work that is an essential prerequisite to obtaining the necessary level
of exploration investment from both national and foreign enterprises working
in the sector.
II. THE PETROLEUM SECTOR
A.   INTRODUCTION
2.01      Peru, Latin America's first commercial oil producer, has recently
become again a net exporter of crude oil after a long period starting in the
early 1960s, when the country was dependent on imported crude oil to meet its
domestic requirements. Following the completion of the Trans Andean Pipeline
in late 1977, oil production rose rapidly from 80,000 b/d to over 190,000 b/d
in 1979 and is expected to reach 210,000 b/d by 1980. Current estimates of
proven and probable reserves are approximately 1 billion barrels, sufficient
to maintain production for another 12 years at current output levels.
2.02      Exploration activity, which was at a high level during the first
half of the 1970s, has fallen off sharply since 1976; only one of the original
16 prospecting consortia continues to be active in the Amazon region, and no
new exploration contracts have been signed since April 1978. Both technical
and political considerations have been important factors in this decline in
exploration activity. Technically, the Amazon basin was found to have a far
more complex geological structure than first envisaged, with reserves being
found in smaller traps rather than in the hoped for large scale anticline
structures. Politically, the GOP's vacillating attitudes towards foreign
petroleum companies - ranging from the expropriation of the International
Petroleum Company in 1968, to the vanguard 50-50 production sharing contracts
of the early 1970s - accompanied by the recent proposed return to Democratic
Government, with elections scheduled for May 1980, has caused most companies
to adopt a go-slow stance to new exploration ventures.
2.03      A number of companies are,  nevertheless, reviewing the existing
technical data and have shown some signs of wishing to begin  new exploration
ventures once some of the political problems are resolved.  The Government
issued on December 7, 1979, a new Decree Law clarifying its position on the
type of production sharing contract that it is willing to offer foreign com-
panies. The Government projects that exploration investment on the order of
about $400 million per year throughout the 1980s will be required to maintain
sufficient production to meet the growing domestic demand and still continue
to export; and PETROPERU is, at best, likely to be able to provide one-half
of this.

B.  Historical Perspective
2.04       Peru is one of the oldest oil producing countries in the Western
Hemisphere. The first oil wells were drilled in 1863 on the Ncorthwest Coast
near Talara, four years after the first commercial fields in the USA were
developed. By 1920 Peru was producing about 12 million barrels of oil per
year, 40% of the total South American output.
2.05       During the 1920's and 1930's, Peruvian production grew relatively
slowly reaching a peak of 17.6 million barrels per year in 1936, while other
Latin Amer:ican countries, notably Venezuela and Argentina, expanded theirs
rapidly, so that by 1940 Peruvian output accounted for no more than 5% of the
total for South America.
2.06       During the late 1940's and 1950's, with gasoline and fuel oil prices
amongst the lowest iLn the world and reduced producers' profit margins, growth
in consumption outstripped that of production. By 1958, partly due to this
situation the princiLpal foreign oil company, International Petroleum Company
(IPC), the producer of 90% of Peru's crude output, terminated all development
and exploration actJivity for almost two years.
2.07       While prodLuction from the traditional coastal and offshore producing
fields in Northern Pleru grew slowly throughout the 1960's, consumption con-
tinued to grow rapidLly, and Peru became increasingly dependent on crude oil
imports to meet its own domestic requirements. To reverse this trend of
increasing oil dependence, the new military government undertook a major
effort at the end of- the 1960's to stimulate exploration activity in Peru's
Amazon basin east of' the Andes.  A few important discoveries, and no sig-
nificant failures, gave rise to high expectations regarding the hydrocarbon
potential of the Amazon basin.
2.08       The transandean pipeline system, the largest single investment
project in Peru's history, was initiated in 1972 on the basis of these
optimistic projections. When completed in late 1977 and extendled with a
branch line to the Occidental Petroleum fields in 1978, total cost was over
$800 million. Most of this was financed by PETROPERU on stringent medium
term commercial banlc and supplier credit terms, with the expectation that the
pipeline would reach full capacity (and be expanded) shortly af'ter completion.
2.09       The initial exploration successes, however, were followed by a
number of unsuccessi-ul exploratory wells in what had been regarded as very
large structures wit:h promising hydrocarbon potential. These disappointments,
the high explorationi costs of the Peruvian Amazon basin, the inflexible work
obligations stipulated by the exploration contracts, and a part icularly
critical modification in US tax legislation, 1/ all contributed to the exodus
1/   In 1976, US companies, in order to qualify their exploration losses for
an offsetting domestic (US) tax liability, abandoned their operations;
these losses, because of changes in the US tax code, would not have been
allowable the following year.

of 15 of the original 16 exploration companies by the end of 1976. However,
Occidental Petroleum, the one successful foreign company, has continued to
invest in new exploration in the jungle with notable further success (IBRD
Map 14471).
2.10      Following the increase in international crude oil prices in 1973,
Peru's net oil import bill rose sharply, averaging approximately US$200
million per annum between 1975-77 and represented a severe burden on
Peru's deteriorating balance of payments. However, due primarily to the
continued efforts of Occidental, the earlier discoveries of PETROPERU, and
the completion of the TransAndean pipeline network, Peru's production in-
creased sharply and by mid-1978 Peru again became self-sufficient in oil.
Since then, production has continued to increase and PETROPERU has been able
to export significant volumes of petroleum and petroleum products. Revenues
from these exports in 1979 are expected to reach over US$600 million.
2.11      This recent encouraging production trend, however, conceals a number
of structural weaknesses and policy concerns elsewhere in the sector which
give rise to uncertainty regarding Peru's ability to continue as a net
exporter of oil. In the first place, the recent increase in production
is attributable almost solely to the efforts of a single company, Occidental.
PETROPERU's production, after increasing sharply in 1977 and 1978, has been
erratic in recent months; as a consequence, the role that PETROPERU will
play in contributing to future production remains uncertain. Second, the
financial difficulties of PETROPERU brought to a virtual standstill new
investment in exploration and production. Finally, the lack of a coherent
strategy for attracting foreign exploration capital had created uncertainty
as to whether, during the next three or four years, the level of investment
required to bring about a growth in reserves sufficient to meet domestic
demand throughout the remainder of the 1980 will be forthcoming.
C.   PETROLEUM RESOURCES
Geology
2.12      Peru is comprised of four major geologic provinces each of which
contains sedimentary basins with hydrocarbon bearing potential: (1) the
coastal belt, the narrow region lying between the coastline on the west and
the Andean Cordillera on the east; (2) the Amazon region, the low jungled
plain along the eastern and northeastern areas of Peru; (3) the Andes
Cordillera, the high and geologically complex north-south trending ranges
that form the backbone of Peru and separates the coastal belt from the Amazon
region; and (4) the offshore basins lying between the Peru-Chile trench and
the coastline where up to 4 basins have been detected.
2.13      Almost all of Peru's petroleum production has historically been
obtained from the Northwestern coastal belt (IBRD Map 14470). The latest
discoveries were based on gravity surveys in the mid-fifties, which led to two
major onshore fields, and seismic surveys in the late 1950's and early 1960's,
which led to seven offshore fields.



- 9 -
2.14      The three important sedimentary basins of the Amazon region, the
Maranon, Ucayali, and Madre de Dios basins are part of large asymmetric
depressions between the Andes on the west and shield areas on the east.
Current production comes primarily from the Maranon basin which contains 13
fields, all discovered by PETROPERU and Occidental Petroleum. The traps are
predominantly faulted anticlines, located primarily by seismic surveys. The
Ucayali basin which has characteristics similar to those found in the Maranon
basin, has two producing fields both under the control of PETROPE'RU. No oil
production has been established as yet from the Madre de Dios basin, although
large oil seeps are known.
2.15      The hydrocarbon potential of the third geologic province, the Andes
Cordilleras, appears low and the complexity of its geology probably precludes
serious exploration efforts in the foreseable future. However, the now
abandoned Pirin Field is located in the Altiplano basin and additional small
fields may be discovered in this region.
Reserves
2.16      Estimates of Peru's recoverable crude oil reserves vary widely.  In
1977, PETROPERU estimated reserves at approximately 750 million barrels. How-
ever, some experts, including those from the US Geological Survey, believe
that the 40% recovery factor used to obtain the 550 million barrel Amazon
reserves figure is over optimistic, and consider a lower recovery factor of
28% more representative. On the basis of this lower recovery factor and the
depletion of reserves in 1978, the current estimate of the US Geological Survey
for proved reserves is 565 million barrels as follows:
Primary Recovery Reserve Estimates
In millions of Barrels
Region             PETROPERU Estimates   US Estimates
Amazon                      550                 385
Talara COnshore             132                 120
Talara Offshore             74                   60
Total                 756                  565
The US Geological Survey estimates that additional reserves - amounting to
500 million barrels -- can be recovered from known reservoirs through the
application of secondary recovery methods.  When inferred reserves of 30
million barrels of heavy crude oil in the Occidental lB block area are added,
total reserves amount to 1095 million barrels, or approximately 10-12 years of
production at present rates. Peru's reserves in the context of South America's
total oil reserves are small, amounting to only 4%.



- 10 -
2.17      The question of undiscovered reserves is much more difficult to
assess reliably. While estimates of ultimately recoverable reserves vary
from 2 billion to 40 billion barrels, most of the higher estimates are
based on expectations for the Amazon Basin in large stratigraphic traps and
in deep water at the edge of the continental shelf. Both require expensive
technologies; for the latter the technology is still in the development phase
and may not be viable for the next ten to fifteen years.
Recent Production Trends
2.18      After stagnating throughout the first part of the 1970's, output
started to increase in 1977 as production from the jungle came on stream,
averaging 91,000 b/d as compared with 76,000 b/d in 1976. The past year,
1978, was an important turning point for Peru's production. Peru was not
only able to attain self-sufficiency but became a net petroleum exporter for
the first time since the early 1960's. From an average daily production of
112,000 barrels/day (b/d) in the first quarter of 1978, output increased by
over 50% to an average of 181,000 b/d by the fourth quarter, due exclusively
to a fourfold increase in output from Occidental's operations in the north-
eastern jungles of Peru; average production throughout 1978 averaged 150,500
b/d. Total production in the period 1976-78 is summarized in the table below.

Source: PETROPERU.
2.19      In 1979 Peru will export approximately 25 million barrels of crude
oil and refined products, equivalent to one-third of its total production.
Aggregate crude oil output in January and February averaged 165,000 b/d and
in March increased to 184,000 b/d; since early April, production has been
averaging 210,000 b/d. These production levels compared with an average
production of 92,000 b/d fifteen months ago in January 1978 provides some
measure of the surge in Peru's crude oil output during this period. With
the volume of crude oil refined domestically in Peru currently averaging
135,000 b/d, there is a sizeable margin in crude oil alone available for
export. Furthermore the prospects for continuing as a net exporter, at least
in the mid-1980's, are encouraging. Longer term prospects will depend to a
large extent on Peru's ability to attract new exploration investment over the
next few years.

D.   DEVELOPMENT PROSPECTS
New Exploration Activity
2.20      The GOP is still uncertain about the aggregate level of exploration
that can be anticipated over the next few years, particularly exploration
in the Amazon jungle region. Although as its financial position improves
PETROPERU is expected to renew its exploration activities, a large part of
future exploration will necessarily have to be undertaken by private petroleum
companies given their expertise and the magnitude of the effort required; it
is still too early to tell how private foreign companies will react to the
GOP's new initiatives. However, it is clear that a number of foreign petro-
leum companies believe that Peru has considerable undiscovered reserves, par-
ticularly in the Amazons. Furthermore, refinements in seismic techniques over
the past five years have improved the probability of finding this oil. More
detailed work is expected both in the northern jungle areas where previous
exploratory activity has yielded a firm preliminary data base on which to
build, and in the Central and Southern Amazon areas which have as yet been
only sparsely explored.  While a number of new companies, including Sun Oil,
Shell, and Aininoil have shown preliminary interest, and both Occidental and
Belco are interested in exploration activities on new blocks, no new explo-
ration contracts have been signed since April 1978.
Production
2.21      The overall petroleum picture through 1985 looks promising, with
even conservative forecasts showing a continued exportable surplus for the
entire period. Production is forecast to increase from 151,000 b/d in 1977
to 197,000 b/d in 19793, and then to continue to grow slowly until it reaches
a peak average output of about 231,000 b/d in 1983.
2.22      Occidental's Amazon operations are expected to provide more than
half of this total through at least 1983. With its high exploration success
rate continuing through 1978, Occidental should be capable of maintaining
production from its Amazon fields above 100,000 b/d through 1984. Since
the decline in primary production from existing Belco and PETROPERU coastal
operations should be more than offset by the planned secondary recovery
projects coming on stream in the early 1980's, the major uncertainties
affecting the 1985 production estimates are limited to two factors. (1)
PETROPERU's production from new finds, particularly near its current Amazon
operations. (2) New exploration success in newly opened jungle areas by
private petroleum companies.
2.23      Even on a conservative basis, which discounts any possible explo-
ration discoveries by companies not currently operating in Peru, aggregate
crude oil otltput in 1985 should not fall below 200,000 b/d. Estimated crude
oil production between 1978-85 is summarized below:

Exports
2.24      Domestic demand for petroleum products is expected to remain fair-
ly stable until 1980, and to increase  at about 5% per year thereafter.  As
a result, exports, which will total about 25 million barrels in 1979, are
projected to fall slowly to about 23 million barrels by 1985.  After supplying
the domestic market, PETROPERU's share of the 1979 export market will amount
to about 17.8 million barrels; PETROPERU projects crude exports of 14.8 mil-
lion barrels for $480 million, and about 3 million barrels of products for
about $120 million for a total of $600 million.
Investment
2.25       Investment prospects in the next 3 or 4 years look encouraging.  The
major thrust will be the continuation of Occidental's efforts in exploring for
and developing new and existing fields in its contract areas, complemented by
substantial investments in secondary recovery projects. On the basis of dis-
cussions with all parties concerned, the mission believes that under favorable
circumstances, the major elements are likely to be as follows:
i. Occidental would invest some $200 million in developing its
Amazon jungle contract areas Lots IA and 1B (see map IBRD 14471), and another
$190 in secondary recovery investments in the Talara area.



- 13 -
ii. Belco would invest $35 million in new exploration, development,
and secondary recovery operations off-shore Talara aimed primarily at main-
taining its current production levels.
iii. PETROPERU would spend about $75 million in 1979 and about $200
million thereafter primarily for development and secondary recovery projects
in known producing areas, and to step-up its exploration effort in the Maranon
basin.
iv. Other foreign companies appear to be interested in undertaking
new exploratory activity, principally in the Amazon basins. If an adequate
climate for foreign investment is maintained (including adequate incentives
for high risk - high cost exploration undertakings) investment in exploration
involving three or four additional companies might average $50 million per
year in the mid-1980's with further investment depending on the level of
actual discoveries.
2.26      If half of the above projects were to materialize Peru could expect
that a total of about $2 billion would be invested in petroleum exploration
and development activities during the first half of the 1980s, 40% of which
would come from PETROPERU. This level of investment should be adequate to
ensure at least continued exports through the end of the 1980s and self-
sufficiency through at least the first half of the 1990s.
E.   GOVERNMENT POLICY
Background
2.27      Peru's petroleum policy has historically been focussed on the
activities of the International Petroleum Company (IPC) which first started
production in Peru in the early 1900's. Throughout several decades, rela-
tions had often been strained on matters related to concession agreements,
tax liabilities and oil prices. In the 1960's disagreements between the
Government and IPC were transformed into a full-scale political crisis which
culminated in the expropriation of all of IPC's assets in 1968 against alleg-
edly owed back taxes, when a new military government came to power. This
was followed by the passage of a new Petroleum Law in 1969 that prohibited
the granting of new exploration and development concessions to private firms.
The law also gave a monopoly on all downstream petroleum related activity to
PETROPERU, the company created to take over the administration of IPC's
assets. Only Belco, a small independent oil company exploring in the off-
shore coastal areas south of Talara, was allowed to continue its exploration
and production activities.
Exploration and Development Policy
2.28      In 1970 the Government modified its exclusionary policy and devel-
oped a new framework for foreign private participation in the petroleum
sector. The basis for the new cooperation was the "Peru Model" contract.
(Annex 2.01) Under this formula private companies could explore for oil



- 14 -
and eventually operate production facilities but to do so they had to enter
into exploration and development contractual arrangements with PETROPERU,
generally on the basis of a 50-50 split of production. The contractor had to
pay all its exploration, development and operating costs out of its share of
gross revenues, and PETROPERU was required to pay all of the company's tax
obligations from its share. Because of its basic conceptual simplicity and
ease of implementation, the Peru Model provided a firm basis for initiating
a new phase of foreign involvement in the exploration of the Amazon region.
Led by the discovery of a dozen oil fields in the Oriente basin by Occidental
and by PETROPERU in the early 1970's, 16 other consortiums signed contracts
for exploring sections of the Amazon. IJnfortunately, these early promises
of considerable hydrocarbon potential in the Amazon basin were not fulfilled
(paragraph 2.09). Faced with the realization that production from the Amazon
basins would be substantially less than expected, with the prospects of
mounting costs for oil imports as world petroleum prices rose, and with the
knowledge that neither PETROPERU nor the GOP had sufficient resources to carry
out the required intensive exploration program without foreign assistance,
the GOP initiated in 1977 an active campaign to re-attract private companies
to renew exploration activity. 1/ In addition to providing more favorable
terms, the GOP recently reopened for exploration contracts 25 blocks (each
400 thousand hectares) of onshore and offshore coastal areas which had been
previously reserved for PETROPERU, in addition to the 47 blocks (each 1
million hectares) reopened in the Amazon in early 1977.
2.29      While a number of oil companies have shown renewed interest in new
contracts for some of these areas, Occidental's contract on a second block
(Block 1B) contiguous to its existing contract area has been the only new
contract concluded. The response to PETROPERU's call for bids for secondary
recovery projects, however, in the Talara oil fields has been much more
promising. Occidental signed a contract and started secondary recovery
operations in 1978 based on the standard "Peru Model" - that is production
sharing - and MAPCO had negotiations well underway for secondary recovery
operations onshore Talara, when GOP issued the new basis for exploration and
production contracts, in which it is stated that future secondary recovery
projects will be carried out by PETROPERU (itself or in joint ventures).
2.30      As part of the 1977 campaign to re-attract private risk capital
into exploring the Amazon basins, the GOP hired an internationally recognized
investment bank consortium to evaluate the alternative types of contracts for
consideration in future exploration and production agreements. Their find-
ings were made available recently to a high level government sub-committee
under the direction of MEM, which presented to the highest authorities of
Peru the basis for future exploration and production contracts. On December
6, 1979, the Peruvian Cabinet approved Decree Law 22774 which updated the
"Peruvian Model?? to better comply with current trends in the international
oil industry. In this regard, the following main aspects and modifications
have been introduced into the new Law:
1/   The Government had suspended the awarding of new contracts since
September 1973.



- 15 -
(i)  flexibility is given to PETROPERU in drawing up new contracts,
in such a way that payments in kind made by PETROPERU to its
contractors in exchange for their services, would be a func-
tion of the geological characteristics, exploration risks and
presumed devealopment costs. Moreover, PETROPERU might take
part, with not less than 25% equity participation, in joint
ventures with private oil firms;
(ii) PETROPERU shall carry out any new secondary or tertiary
recovery project, although acquired rights will be honored;
and
(iii)  PETROPERU's contrators would directly pay to the Peruvian
Treasury its own income taxes; 1/ therefore, US-based companies
would be eligible for full tax credit in the U.S.
It is clearly stated in the new Law, and it has been reconfirmed during dis-
cussions with senior Government officials, that it is Peru's objective to rely
on private risk capital for a substantial portion of the required investment
in oil exploration and production. The new Law, although quite general and
in need of some refinement, provides framework for negotiating new agreements.
In this regard GOP has already been approached by some oil compan:ies indicating
their intentions to participate in the exploration of the Peruvian jungle,
although it is likely that progress will depend on the outcome of renego-
tiations of existing contracts now underway (paragraph 2.38).
Pricing Policy
2.31      Following the 1973 international oil price increases, GOP's con-
sumer pricing policy for petroleum was to endeavour to protect the economy
from the disruptive effects of immediate price increases towards import
parity. Petroleum product prices, which had not been increased since June
1969, continued unchantged until June 1975. At the same time, consumption
of petroleum products, which had maintained a modest growth rate of approxi-
mately 3% per annum between 1970-73, more than doubled this rate of growth
between 1973-75, imposing an increasing burden on Peru's balance of payments.
Although small price increases took place in 1975 and again at the beginning
of 1976, the first determined action to stem the rapid rise in consumption
came in July 1976 when regular gasoline prices were more than doubled from
US$0.31/gallon equivalent to US$0.77/gallon equivalent. Further increases
to keep up with inflation took place in 1977 and 1978, not only affecting
domestic prices of gasoline but also of diesel, fuel oil and kerosene prod-
ucts. As of September 1979 the domestic prices of the more important petro-
leum products were as follows:
1/   Tax bracket would be 68.5% of net income before taxes.



- 16 -
Soles/gallon    US$/gallon 1/
Premium gasoline (octane 95)           230             0.96
Regular gasoline (octane 84)           200              0.83
Diesel                                  98             0.41
Fuel Oil                                75             0.31
2.32      The impact of these price increases is evident in the overall con-
sumption trend for petroleum products. From an average daily consumption of
116,000 b/d in 1975, 2/ consumption fell to 113,400 b/d in 1978, and is not
expected to exceed 116,000 b/d in 1979. The impact is even more striking for
for gasoline consumption: from an average daily consumption of 36,300 b/d in
1975, consumption fell by 25% to 27,400 b/d by 1978, and 1979 consumption is
forecast to decrease further to 26,900 b/d, the same consumption level as in
1969. However, some of this decrease was due to the depressed state of the
economy.
2.33      Equally important has been the improvement in the fiscal contri-
bution brought about by these price increases, despite the overall reduction
in consumption. At the beginning of 1976 excise taxes on gasoline were 14%.
In 1979 they had increased to 32%. While prices are still well below those
found in Europe, they are significantly higher than the average for North
and South America; the following table is indicative of this trend. Overall,
the Government has increased prices to keep up with inflation on six separate
occasions from January 1978, the most recent increase 11% in January 1980.

Retail prices of kerosene and diesel oil have been maintained at low levels.
Peru's price policies for kerosene are based on socio-economic grounds, since
it is the prime source of fuel for cooking and heating for the poor, but con-
tinued subsidization of diesel oil and fuel oil, which are used in the trans-
port and industrial sectors, distort consumption patterns and lead to imbal-
ances in domestic refinery output requirements. For the proposed project
(paragraph 5.05 (iii)) the government will increase ex-refinery prices of
petroleum products in 1980; this measure will, of course, also lead to
increases in retail prices. In addition, starting in 1981 a best effort
clause regarding future price increases to reach international price levels
gradually has been agreed. In monitoring these periodic adjustments we would
review individual product prices and product growth patterns, arnd encourage
the government to move towards interfuel price relationship based on the
opportunity cost of competing fuels.
Taxation and Incentive Policy
2.34      Foreign contractors previously were isolated from the impact of
domestic tax legislation by their "Peruvian Model" contracts. These con-
tracts called for a distribution of benefits based exclusively on the gross
petroleum output. In the standard contract the foreign company got to sell
at international prices 50% of the oil it produced net of all tax obligations,
be they import duties, export taxes, production taxes or income taxes. One of
the goals of these contracts when they were first introduced was to improve
the climate for new foreign investment by eliminating the possibility of
conflicts on tax related issues; issues that in the past had formed the basis
for disputes between the GOP and foreign oil companies. However, isolating
the contractors through the device of requiring PETROPERU to pay all their
taxes out of its share of the revenues meant that PETROPERU has had to bear
the full brunt of all oil related taxes imposed by the GOP on the Petroleum
Sector. The most iTmportant taxes paid by PETROPERU are: (1) income tax on
foreign contractor's net income; (2) profits remittance taxes for foreign
contractors; (3) export and import taxes on petroleum and petroleum products;
(4) import taxes on capital goods and operating materials and equipment for
itself and for foreign contractors; (5) employment taxes and special regional
production taxes, again for itself and for foreign contracts, and (6) Income
tax on its own operations.
2.35      PETROPERU's tax obligations accrued from its foreign contractors
operations grew rapidly along with the rapid growth of their output; from
$10.6 million in 1975 (2% of PETROPERU's gross revenues) to an estimated
US$89.1 million in 1978 (12.5% of PETROPERU's gross revenues). This occurred
in part because an unexpected ruling by the Peruvian IRS led to the calcula-
tion of foreign contractors' tax obligations in a way that made them greater
than the value of the 50% of the gross production that PETROPERU received
from these companies to cover the tax obligations.
2.36      Further, PETROPERU's payment of import and export taxes stopped it
from trading (or swapping) different types of petroleum and petroleum prod-
ucts, everL though such swaps could have been financially advantageous for
Peru. Fur-thermore, export taxes that depend on the source of the crude oil



- 18 -
also distort the efficient allocation of resources. Because the export taxes
on petroleum from the coastal regions are $0.90 per barrel higher than that
for petroleum from the Amazon, PETROPERU has been encouraged to export its
lower grade Amazon petroleum and use its higher grade coastal petroleum
domestically even though the latter would bring a better export price.
2.37      On December 6, 1979, GOP issued a Law Decree clarifying the taxation
regime that will apply to the petroleum sector, and instructing PETROPERU and
foreign oil companies on how taxes are to be reported for 1978 and 1979. 1/
2.38      Under the new taxation regime, foreign oil companies operating in
Peru will be liable for paying to the Peruvian Treasury its own income taxes
(tax bracket 55%) and profit remittances taxes (30% of net income after
taxes). 2/ On the other hand, PETROPERU will continue to be liable for paying
on behalf of its contractors taxes on export of crude oil, import duties
on materials and equipment, and production royalties and cannons. However,
overall import and export tax payments, as well as royalties, now will be
deductible from PETROPERU's income tax calculations. Taxes accruing from 1978
and 1979 operations will be reported under the new tax regime outlined above,
although the new Law Decree fell short of specifying who, PETROPERU or foreign
oil contractors, will be liable to the Peruvian Treasury for paying foreign
oil contractors' income and remittances taxes for 1978 and 1979, a matter
which is under negotiation. The new tax regime assimilates the petroleum
sector to the general tax code of Peru and, although burdensome, it would
correct past damaging effects on PETROPERU's finances. US-based companies
operating in Peru would be eligible for U.S. tax credits, under the recently
issued guidelines of the United States IRS. Assuming a satisfactory conclu-
sion of renegotiations of existing contracts now underway, there would be
a basis for renewed investment by the private sector.
Role of the Bank
2.39      Bank involvement in Peru's petroleum sector has several important
objectives. First, with internal demand likely to rebound after several
years of stagnation, it is essential that PETROPERU be able to maintain the
production capacity of existing facilities and also have the capacity to
develop new production potential, if Peru is to avoid becoming a net oil
importer again in the early 1980s. The provision of urgently needed pumping
equipment will help achieve this objective by stabilizing and increasing
PETROPERU's production from the jungle and coastal producing fields; in
addition, providing financial assistance for updating a feasibility study for
an important secondary recovery project, will prepare the ground for a large
1/   The deadline for filing these returns has been extended for the fourth
time to March 1980.
2/   Contractors' taxes on income to the Peruvian Treasury will be provided
to PETROPERU in the form of yearly equity injections for the purpose of
helping finance PETROPERU's investment program.



- 19 -
investment in new production capacity.  The second important objective of
Bank involvement in the sector would be to facilitate a solution to PETROPERU's
two most pressing institutional difficulties: the weakened operalting and
managerial capabilities brought about by the recent loss of numerous technical
personnel; and the need to return PETROPERU to a sound financial footing by
strengthening the company's capital structure, rationalizing the current tax
regime, and by encourasging PETROPERU to exercise a greater degree of financial
independence than currently exists. Thirdly, by providing financial assis-
tance for updating a feasibility study for an important secondary recovery
Project, the Bank will. better be able not only to ensure a sound technical and
economic basis for proceeding with the project, but more importantly, to play
an active ro:Le in mobilizing finance for this project from a number of inter-
ested financial and investment institutions. Finally, by responding quickly
to PETROPERU's current: financing needs at a critical time, the Bank would be
in a position to establish an effective dialogue with the pertinent government
ministries on a number of sectoral policy matters affecting the future devel-
opment of the sector -- among them, exploration incentives for new contract
areas in the jungle, a need to define more precisely the activities of pri-
vate companies, and domestic pricing for petroleum products.
2.40      An effective dialogue has already been initiated between the Bank
and Peru's policy makers on these matters which will be further studied under
the proposed loan. With the possibility of another round of petroleum explo-
ration activity in the near future, the Bank has the prospect of providing not
only urgently needed long-term financing to PETROPERU, but the analytical
basis to the government for it to determine the best means of attracting
additional investment in the sector.
III. THE BORROWER
Background
3.01      The national oil company, Petroleos del Peru (PETROPERIJ), was
established by Decree-Law 17753 on July 24, 1969 following the nationali-
zation of the production and refining operations held at the time by the
foreign-owne!d International Petroleum Company (IPC). 1/ On this date,
PETROPERU absorbed the production operations of the Empresa Petrolera
Fiscal, (EPF) a government-owned oil company with production operations in
the Northern Peruvian. coastal region, in an area nearby to those of IPC, and
1/   Esso Corporation.



- 20 -
assumed responsibility for the management and administration of IPC's produc-
tion and refining operations. In 1973 PETROPERU acquired the Conchan, Lobitos
and Ganso Azul companies which were privately owned. 1/ As a result of these
acquisitions, PETROPERU now controls 100% of the refining capacity and 98% of
the petroleum products marketed in Peru.
Operations
3.02      PETROPERU is the official entity for conducting all the state's
activities in the hydrocarbon sector, including not only exploration, produc-
tion, refining and marketing of all petroleum products, but also activities
related to pipeline transportation of crude oil, fertilizer production and
petrochemicals. PETROPERU also has a small fleet of petroleum tankers which
are used for the transport of crude oil and petroleum products between the
Peruvian coastal ports as well as for river transport in the Peruvian Amazon
region.
3.03      PETROPERU's production, which averaged 50,800 b/d in 1978, comes
from two main producing areas:  (a) the coastal area where average daily
output in 1978 was 31,500 barrels; and (b) the jungle area where average
daily output in 1978 was 19,300 barrels. PETROPERU's refining operations
comprise four main refineries which have an overall capacity of approximately
170,000 b/d. The two largest refineries are at La Pampilla (92,000 b/d) and
Talara (65,000 b/d) and together account for almost all of Peru's refining
capacity; two small refineries are located in the jungle to meet the small
market needs of that area. PETROPERU has a network of storage depots and
retail outlets located throughout the country. Except for lubricants,
PETROPERU is the sole marketer of petroleum products in the country. The
other major petroleum operation owned by PETROPERU is the Trans-Andean pipe-
line which extends from San Jose de Saramuro in the northern jungle to the
northern coastal port of Bayovar, a total length of 853 km. In addition, a
northern branch line from Occidental's producing          fields linking up with
the main Trans-Andean pipeline is also owned by PETROPERU. The design capacity
of the Trans-Andean pipiline is approximately 240,000 b/d and of the northern
branch line, 100,000 b/d.
Organization
3.04      PETROPERU is governed by a Board of Directors consisting of nine
members. The Chairman of the Board is the highest ranking official within
PETROPERU. Four members of the Board are representatives of the Ministry of
1/   Conchan - A small refinery operation; Lobitos - a foreign-owned company
(Burmah Oil) with production and marketing operations in the coastal
area; Ganso Azul - a Peruvian-owned company with a small production
operation in the Central jungle. El Oriente, a Peruvian-owned private
oil company with a small production operation in the Central Jungle.
Gulf Oil Company marketing and distribution operations in the metro-
politan Lima area were also acquired.



- 21 -
Energy and Mines and two others are representatives of the Ministry of
Industry, and the Ministry of Economy and Finance; the remaining two members
are representatives of PETROPERU's professional and working-level employees,
in accordance with Peru's industrial legislation requirements. Nlone of the
managers of the key operating departments, including the general manager, are
represented on the Board.
3.05      The Board has responsibility for approving all interna]L policy
matters related to personnel administration, general salary increases, invest-
ment decisions, and budget matters. During the period of severe economic
recession in 1978, salaries of public sector entities such as PETROPERU were
strictly controlled by Central Government guidelines and any genesral salary
increase required prior approval of the Cabinet. In recent months this
control has been somewhat relaxed and the Board now has alithority to approve
general salary increases within the framework of the approved budget. Never-
theless, because of the complex financial dependence of PETROPERIJ on the
Central Government PETROPERU has been unable to exercise any substantive
degree of financial operating independence since 1973.
3.06      The General Manager, in collaboration with the key operational
managers in the exploration-production, refining and engineering departments,
have responsibility for day-to-day operational matters. The aut'hority of the
General Manager is relatively limited, however, and many matters such as
minor operational investment decisions are referred directly to the Board.
3.07      The field offices also have limited authority and routine opera-
tional matters are frequently submitted to Lima for approval, particularly
in past months with t:he shortage of experienced field personnel. The general
lack of managerial authority within the company and over-centralized control
by the Central Government in recent years, have frustrated PETROPERU's oper-
ating efficiency and has contributed to the current weak institutional situa-
tion of the company. PETROPERU's management organization will be reviewed
in conjunction with the second study (ref. paragraph 3.14) aimed at improving
PETROPERU's financia'L management practices.
Staffing, Management and Salaries
3.08      The total rnumber of employees of PETROPERU is approximately 8,500,
somewhat larger than private oil companies. This is, in part, attributable
to the widespread use of contractors by private companies in their field opera-
tions, particularly drilling, while PETROPERU has endeavored to build up an
in-house technical expertise. Approximately 1,000 of PETEROPEREU's employees
are located in the central headquarters in Lima; a sizeable number are located
in PETROPERU's field offices, the most important of which are in Talara and
Iquitos. The Talara office employs approximately 4,000 personnel and the
Iquitos office approximately 700.
3.09      PETROPERU's senior management is competent and has extensive expe-
rience in the petroleum industry in Peru. PETROPERU's middle management how-
ever, is much less experienced and has been weakened by the loss of numerous
technical and administrative staff in the past 12-18 months. This has been



- 22 -
primarily due to salary difficulties within the company since 1976 at a time
when there was a resurgence of petroleum activity in Peru which provided an
alternative and nearby market for PETROPERU's experienced operating personnel.
The Exploration and Production Department in Lima lost almost 50% of its
technical staff in 1978. Most of these engineers had an average experience
of 12 years or more; the average experience has been reduced in consequence
to less than 5 years.
3.10      Earlier this year measures were taken by the Government aimed at
improving the salary structure of all the major public sector enterprises,
including PETROPERU. First, a policy decision was taken to free such enter-
prises from salary ceiling strictures which had severely limited the ability
of public sector enterprises to improve the salary conditions of their
staff. Second, a salary increase came into effect in March which increased
most salaries of professional staff by some 25-30%; additional benefits
were also included in the salary package. As a consequence, PETROPERU's
salaries are now comparable with those of Peruvians employed in private
petroleum companies in Peru, and the loss of staff from PETROPERU to con-
tractors operating in Peru has declined. Further salary increases are
expected later this year. During negotiations, agreement was reached with
the government and PETROPERU that the competitiveness of PETROPERU's salaries
will be maintained throughout the implementation of the project. For this
purpose, PETROPERU will inform the Bank at regular intervals not exceeding
6 months, of any salary increases for its professional staff, and make a
comparison of such salary levels with equivalent levels in private oil com-
panies operating in Peru.
3.11      Despite this loss of experienced staff, PETROPERU has shown itself
capable in past months of attending to its most urgent operational needs with
its current staff. Nevertheless, considerable strengthening of PETROPERU's
technical capabilities will be required if PETROPERU is to be able to exercise
a more dynamic role in exploration and production throughout the next decade.
For this reason the proposed loan contemplates the training of PETROPERU's
less experienced staff, consultancy services to help train PETROPERU's field
staff in maintenance of new pumping equipment, and an upgrading of PETROPERU's
reservoir engineering capabilities so as to optimize the design of field
production installations, and produce oil at a rate that would lead to the
most efficient overall recovery.
Accounting and Auditing
3.12      Because PETROPERU was created as a result of a merger of IPC and
EPF, and subsequently absorbed five other smaller private petroleum operations
with substantially different accounting procedures, the standardizing of all
these different accounting and budgeting procedures, as well as updating and
modernizing them, is still being resolved. Substantial progress has been made
in recent years, and standardization will be finalized shortly.
3.13      PETROPERU's internal audit department, under the direction of a
Chief Internal Auditor, reports directly to PETROPERU's Board of Directors
and is subject to audit review by the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor
General of Peru. PETROPERU's Chief Internal Auditor has prepared a plan of



- 23 -
action to gradually tackle the company's auditing procedures, but implementa-
tion difficulties are likely to occur due to the limited experience and
capabilities of its current staff. Due largely to the nationalization of
privately-owned industries in 1968, and the vast work load imposed on the
Auditor-General's office, no external auditing of PETROPERU's accounts was
undertaken until 1976 when the government retained Evans, Tapia and Associates
(representatives of Arthur Young and Co.) for a period of two years. Since
discrepancies existed in PETROPERU's fixed assets valuation anid depreciation
schedules, as well as in several other accounts, the independent auditors were
unable to certify PETROPERU's accounts for fiscal years 1976 and 1977; they
did acknowledge, however, that substantial improvements had been made in 1977
by PETROPERU and the government in clarifying PETROPERU's financial position.
Despite progress over the last two years in upgrading its accounting systems,
there is still scopi for improvement in such areas as, asset valuation,
contracts for leased equipment, cost accounting, and certain equipment
purchases.
3.14      In order to help PETROPERU in these matters, two studies will be
financed as components of the proposed loan; these studies would be carried out
in close collaboration with PETROPERU and COFIDE 1/ by qualified consulting
firms. The first study is aimed at helping PETROPERU carry-out an in-depth
study of its fixed assets, including the urgently needed physical counting and
book reconciliation.  The second study is aimed at modernizing PETROPERU's
overall accounting, budgeting, and internal auditing procedures as well as
improving information requirements throughout the company. Consultants to
help PETROPERU to carry out the second study will be appointed not later than
August 31, 1980. The first study and the inventory of its fixed assets and
book reconciliatiorn will be completed not later than August 31, 1981. The
second study will be completed not later than October 31, 1981.
Insurance
3.15      PETROPERIJ carries adequate comprehensive insurance cn all its
facilities and equ.ipment against fire, blow-outs, damage, earthquakes and
theft. Insurance agreements are entered into directly by PETROPERU either
with foreign insurance companies or with local insurance companies reinsured
by foreign insurance companies.
IV. THE PROJECT
Background
4.01      Historically, most of Peru's crude oil has been produced from the
onshore and offshore Northeastern coastal area close to Talara (Map IBRD
14470). This area has been in production for more than 100 years and until
the early 1960's met all of Peru's domestic oil requirements. More than
10,000 wells have been drilled in the area and approximately 1 billion barrels
of crude oil produced.

financing institution entrusted - inter alia - with responsibility of
helping to strengthen institutional aspects of public sector agencies.



- 24 -
4.02      Current production from the Talara area is approximately 60,000 b/d,
about half of which comes from PETROPERU's production operations. PETRO-
PERU's production, however, has been declining steadily for many years from
this area, down from 63,000 b/d in 1965 to 31,000 b/d in 1978. Despite the
large number of wells drilled and the extensive production history, a con-
siderable volume of oil can still be recovered through reactivation of old
wells, further drilling in known producing areas, and application of secondary
recovery methods.
4.03      Crude oil production in the northern Peruvian Amazon basin first
started in the early 1970s but a significant increase in production came about
only with the completion of the Trans-Andean pipeline. By the end of 1978
production had reached 120,000 b/d, or 2/3 of Peru's total output. The bulk
of this production originated from Occidental's producing fields; PETROPERU's
production from the Amazon region averaged only 25,000 b/d and has been erratic
in past months due to the lack of pumping facilities as reservoir pressures
declined. Moreover, the recent loss of many experienced technical staff,
investment constraints, and the cessation of exploration activity, gave rise
to doubts as to whether PETROPERU could even maintain current production
levels from either its coastal or jungle areas.
4.04      Against this background, the Minister of Energy and Mines requested
that a Bank mission visit Peru in early 1979 to review the financial require-
ments of the petroleum sector and to assist in its future development. Fol-
lowing a reconnaissance mission in February 1979 and a subsequent preparation
mission in April, an initial package for possible Bank financial assistance
was identified. A Bank Appraisal Mission subsequently visited Peru between
May 22 and June 9, 1979, and a short updating mission returned in July 1979.
PROJECT DESCRIPTION
General Objectives
4.05      The project comprises several components designed, first, to increase
Peru's oil production in the short term by rehabilitating production operations
under the control of PETROPERU; second, to enhance Peru's medium term petroleum
production capacity by undertaking detailed seismic surveys in known producing
areas of the northeastern and central jungle, and by preparing a secondary
recovery investment project to be implemented in the early 1980s; and, finally,
to strengthen the financial and technical capability of PETROPERU. Each of
the components is described in detail in the ensuing paragraphs.
1.   Rehabilitation of Existing Production
4.06      This component comprises: (a) the provision of pumping equipment to
restore declining production from fields in the Peruvian Amazon jungle; and
(b) bringing into production 300 temporarily abandoned wells in the North
Western coastal area.



- 25 -
(a) The Installation of "Artificial Lift" in PETROPERU's Northern
Jungle Operations ($11.9 million)
4.07      PETROPERU's crude oil production in the Northeastern jungle
presently originates from four producing structures. The most prolific
of these is Corrientes, whose present production is approximately 16,000
barrels per day; three smaller fields, Yanayacu, Pavayacu and Capirona, make
up the remainder of a, total average output from this area of 20,000 b/d (see
Map IBRD 14471). The reserve potential of these fields and the total volume
of oil produced so far is given in Annex 4.01.
4.08      Originally, sufficient potential energy was available in these
reservoirs to allow the wells to produce without recourse to any artificial
help. However, the somewhat heavy nature of the oil and the limited amount of
gas in solution has restricted the natural flow of oil from these wells to a
short life span of a few months. In order to be able to maintain sufficient
pressure which will allow the reservoir to produce at its maximum capacity,
artificial lift methods, i.e., "gas lift" or pumping equipment, are normally
installed in the prodiucing fields.
4.09      PETROPERU recently acquired 12 electrical centrifugal down-hole
pumps:  5 have already been installed and 7 will be installed shortly.
Approximately 35 additional electro centrifugal pumps will be required for
the four producing structures. In addition, a workover rig 1/ and a pulling
unit 2/ would be acquired to enhance the efficiency of PETROPERIJ's operations
as well as help increase the level of production from these fie:Lds. The
availability of these units would reduce the high helicopter transportation
costs between different fields and speed up the servicing of weLls during
their productive life. The combined estimated cost of these units is US$3
millions. All these additional units would be financed under tlhe proposed
project. In addition, reservoir simulation studies for the four producing
fields would be undetrtaken. These studies would simulate mathematically the
1/   Workover Rig:  A workover rig is light drilling equipment used to service
oil (and gas) wells during their productive life span.  Among the services
it can perform are: recementing a producing zone to shut out intruding
water which allows the oil to be produced free of any contamination; sand
control to stop abrasion in the production tubing and in the surface
installations; putting a well back in production by shutting off an
exhausted producing horizon and starting production from a new horizon;
cleaning obstructing materials from inside the production tubing or
casing. A workover rig consists of a mast, transmission engines, pumps,
mud tanks, etc. The dimensions of these components are related to the
depth capacity for which the rig is used.
2/   Pulling Unit:  A rig used to keep a well in production, but limited
to the operation of pulling out the production tubing and pumps and
running it back down with other equipment or the same equiLpment after it
has been repaired. It does not have the capability of drilling a well.

actual producing conditions of each of the fields. The purpose would be
to compare the simulation studies with the actual production and reservoir
engineering data from these fields which will enable PETROPERU to improve the
present operational control and determine future development of each of these
producing fields. The total cost of these studies is estimated at US$300,000
and would take four months to complete. Annex 4.02 lists the actual producing
wells in PETROPERU's Northern jungle operations and indicates the present and
future requirements for artificial lift systems. As a result of the proposed
investment, an initial increase in production of approximately 18,500 b/d, or
almost 70% greater than present levels, would be obtained; production will
decline thereafter at approximately 20% per year. The expected production
profile is outlined in Annex 4.03.
(b) Reactivation of 300 Temporarily Abandoned Wells in PETROPERU's
Coastal Operations ($12.1 million)
4.10      Significant volumes of primary production can still be recovered
from wells in the Talara area (Map IBRD 14470) that had been shut down as
marginal in the period prior to the increase in international oil prices in
1973. During the 1950's and 1960's when production from a well fell below
what was then considered the economic limit (typically five barrels per day),
the surface and subsurface production facilities were dismantled and relocated
in wells which had greater production potential. While workover and remedial
treatment of some of these wells continues as part of an ongoing investment
program, new pumping equipment is required to enhance production from a large
number of wells that have ceased to produce. It is estimated that some 1,250
idle wells (out of a total of 10,000 wells drilled) could be reactivated. Of
this total, approximately 300 oil wells are located in the western sector of
the Brea Parinas field.
4.11      Several pumping systems have been used in these wells during their
productive life. It is proposed that a combination of these systems be
acquired for the entire operation as follows:
Pumping Unit                                   No. of Wells
permanent                                  48
Mechanical
moveable                                    36
Mechanical with central electric system                        120
Swabbing 1/                                                     96
300
1/   Swabbing:  An intermittent pumping operation using a mobile pumping unit
which periodically cleans up the producing formation of a well in order
to restore its production capacity. This pumping unit allows one to
obtain, in a very short time, the volume of oil the well would be capable
of yielding.  The swabbing unit is installed in a truck so that it can
attend to a number of wells in the same day.

The proposed investment will provide financing for the installation of pumping
equipment and other accessory equipment and facilities required to reactivate
primary production from 300 wells. PETROPERU's technical staff is currently
studying specific locations of wells to be activated and will determine which
pumping units should be installed on which wells. Bank staff would review the
adequacy of these preparative steps before any disbursement under this compo-
nent of the loan takes place. It is estimated that the additional primary
production from the 300 wells would initially be 400,000 barrels per year,
declining at approximately 5% per year in the 10-year period considered. 1/
Total incremental production is estimated to be 3.5 million barrels.
2.   Development of New Production Potential
4.12      This component comprises: (a) reactivation of PETROPERU's explora-
tion activity by undertaking seismic surveys to delineate more fully a number
of promising structures in the northeastern and central jungle areas; (b) the
updating and completion of a feasibility and basic engineering study for a
secondary recovery project.
(a) Reactivation of Exploration Activity - Semi Detailed and Detailed
Seismic Surveys ($11.3 million)
4.13      Due to worsening financial difficulties which have severely limited
the availability of internal funds, PETROPERU's exploration activity has
declined markedly; no exploratory drilling has taken place since early 1978
and seismic work has also had to be curtailed. While the government's overall
strategy in exploration relies on attracting an increased leveL of investment
in explora,tion from foreign oil companies (paragraph 2.30), an important
complementary role will be played by PETROPERU, particularly in the immediate
future, in intensifying its exploration effort in a limited number of areas
where its earlier exploration activity has met with success and where the
prospect for discovering new oil reserves is promising.  These areas have
already been quite extensively prospected by PETROPERU.
4.14      The initial phase of PETROPERU's exploration program will con-
centrate on carrying out more extensive seismic coverage in two known produc-
ing areas of the Peruvian Amazon region: the north-eastern section of Block
8 in the north-eastern jungle, and two different regions within Block 31 in
the central jungle area. In Block 8, the currently producing fields of
Pavayacu, Yanayacu, Valencia and Corrientes have clear geological alignment
with the currently producing and recently discovered fields in Occidental's
Block 1B (See map tEBRD 14471). In between these two producing areas, seismic
prospecting has been carried out but only with a wide spacing, making it
essential for detailed seismic surveying to be undertaken to evaluate more
comprehensively the potential of this area and delineate more precisely
geological structures that are likely to be present. In addit:ion, the full
1/ Production is expected to continue well beyond their ten year period.



- 28 -
extent of the Pavayacu and Valencia producing structures in PETROPERU's Block
8 has not been fully delineated by the seismic work undertaken so far; seismic
work needs to be completed on two other promising structures, Chambira and San
Juan, which have also been detected in Block 8. Overall, this regional area
is regarded as the most attractive area in all of Peru for detecting new oil
bearing prospects capable of being brought into production in a short period.
4.15      Block 31 is located in the central jungle area where small oil
fields have been producing since as early as 1939; the oil is of excellent
quality in regard to sulfur content and viscosity. Although this area is
located far away from the Trans-Andean pipeline system, pipeline connection
to the nearby river 30 km away and subsequent transportation of crude oil by
barge to one of several small refineries located in the jungle is feasible.
The main objectives of the proposed seismic program to be undertaken in Block
31 is to detect new, shallow, oil bearing formations at depths of approximately
3,000 feet. Most of the oil discoveries made so far have been detected by
surface geology surveys. Subsequently, a group of companies in the early 70s
(Signal, Hispanoil and Total) undertook seismic work in this area. However,
the coverage was limited and advances in seismic technology in the past few
years fully justify a more extensive seismic program.
4.16      The seismic component would comprise, in the first phase, the carry-
ing out of 1,600 line-kms of semi-detailed surveying in two blocks of the
jungle (800 km in Block 8 and 800 km in Block 31) with multiple coverage to
be done by contractors, followed by conventional processing of the seismic
information obtained. Following completion of the seismic work, it is planned
to undertake a further 500 line-kms of detailed seismic survey in these two
blocks. A mutual agreement between PETROPERU and Bank staff on the interpreta-
tion of the seismic results of the first phase, and on the justification for
undertaking additional seismic work, would be reached before the second phase
begins. This will be a condition of disbursement for the second phase.
(b) Feasibility Study for Secondary Recovery Project (US$2.2 million)
4.17      PETROPERU has been planning for some time a secondary recovery
project in the Brea-Parinas area aimed at recovering some 40 million addi-
tional barrels of oil. A feasibility study was undertaken in 1974 by
Keplinger Associates; subsequently, PETROPERU invited proposals for imple-
mentation of the project from two Latin American companies, both of which
submitted detailed proposals. Considerable information, therefore, exists
regarding the proposed secondary recovery project. What is required at
present is to update the current information, define the number of reservoirs
to be included, program an efficient primary production, complete the basic
information and conceptual design work, and then start mobilizing the required
financing. This sub-project would comprise the updating of existing informa-
tion involving approximately 200 man/months of consultancy services; the
study would take 4-6 months to complete. Bank financing of the secondary
recovery project itself could be envisaged in a future lending operation.



- 29 -
3.   Consultancy Services and Training ($3.0 million)
4.18      This would assist PETROPERU, first, by undertaking two studies aimed
at strengthening the company's financial and administrative management systems;
second, by providing foreign technical experts for specific operational
bottlenecks and consolidating the overseas training program for PETROPERU's
operating and technical staff, and finally by undertaking studies to help
define more precisely PETROPERU's future role in the sector, and to recommend
policy alternatives concerning pricing of hydrocarbons to maximize the hydro-
carbon sector's contribution to the economic development of Peru.
4.19      The first set of studies aims at establishing the steps needed to
improve PETEIOPERU's current financial administration and management informa-
tion practices. In order to achieve this, studies (paragraph 3.14) would
be undertaken by an experienced financial management consulting firm(s) in
collaboration with PETROPERU's middle and upper management. In particular,
emphasis will be given to cost control budgeting system, inventory control,
fixed assets revaluation, cash management, general accounting procedures, and
upgrading PETROPERU's electronic data processing and procedure manuals.  Upon
completion of these studies, the recommendations of the consultants would be
discussed with PETROI'ERU's top management and a phased action program agreed
with the Bank for its, implementation.
4.20      Financing of technical advisory services would allow E'ETROPERU to
hire individual or teams of consultants. These consultants would advise
PETROPERU's production and field staff on specific day-to-day operational
difficulties which have become more acute as a result of the recent loss of
experienced operational staff. In addition, funds would be available for
the provision of teclhnical advisory services for the maintenance and repair
work of the large number of pumping units which will be procuredl under the
proposed project. Also, funds would be available to help train PETROPERU's
less experienced operating personnel in reservoir engineering practices.
The recruitment of young petroleum engineers, sending them through a field
training program, selecting the most promising for additional specialized
training abroad, will help strengthen PETROPERU's operations.
4.21      Finally, in the context of the overall development of the petroleum
sector, a study would be undertaken which would examine the futuare explora-
tion and development investment requirements needed to maintain production
at a level which would assure the country's self-sufficiency in crude oil
throughout the next decade. In so doing, the study would help define more
precisely the borrower's role in the future development of the sector, the
level of investment to be undertaken by PETROPERU in complementing the explora-
tion activity of foreign oil companies, as well as outlining the legislative
framework, policy initiatives and specific incentives required to step up
exploration activity in the sector. This study would also examine, inter
alia, the economic benefits to be derived from increasing the capacity to the
northern branch pipeline system, and would come up with specific recommenda-
tions for optimizing the timing of this investment. Agreement was reached
during negotiations that the government will exchange views with the Bank



- 30 -
on the findings of the study and on the action intended to be taken for the
carrying out of the final recommendations of such study. A second study could
also be undertaken concerning pricing of hydrocarbons which will, recommend
policy alternatives to maximize the hydrocarbon sector's contribution to the
economic development of Peru. The study will analyze pricing policies and
price levels on a product-by-product basis to recommend pricing policies that
would ensure rational allocation of resources and the financial viability of
PETROPERU. The impact of such policies will be assessed in financial and
economic terms, taking into account, inter alia, opportunity costs, social
implications, demand elasticity, supply constraints, alternative energy
sources and the measurement and costs of explicit and implicit subsidies.
Project Implementation
4.22      Project implementation schedules of each of the individual sub-
projects are summarized below:

PETROPERU
Most of the individual components to be financed by the Bank will be carried
out within 18-24 months with the exception of the reactivation of 300 wells
for PETROPERU's coastal operations which is expected to take somewhat longer.
These timetables are considered realistic, particularly given the urgency
attached to the projects and the steps already taken to get them underway.



- 31 -
4.23      PETROPERU'S Exploration-Production department will have overall
responsibility for implementation of the important production rehabilitation
component of the project; direct responsibility for installing the pumping
units and undertaking well workovers will fall under the field operating
departments located in Iquitos (for the Northern jungle operations) and
Talara (for the coasital operations). The seismic surveys will be undertaken
by experienced seismic contracting firms working under the direc:tion of the
exploration-production department. Despite the loss of experienced technical
staff throughout 1978 from both the Lima and field department offices,
PETROPERU's senior technical management is experienced and competent. There
is a core of experienced staff in the field to ensure that these components of
the project will be undertaken efficiently. Until PETROPERU's staff becomes
familiar with the maintenance and repair of the pumping units, however, the
services of specialized experts will be needed on a continuing basis over and
above those normally provided in the initial contract. For this purpose, and
for other specialized needs related to this phase of the project, funds will
be made available which will allow PETROPERU to acquire such services as the
need arises.
4.24      For the coastal operations, the existing operating staff is con-
sidered competent to undertake the reactivation of 300 temporarily abandoned
wells. Although the proposed investment will mean stepping up appreciably an
ongoing program, it will not require additional operating staff but rather
a more concentrated focus of available staff on the Brea-Parinas area where
the project: will be carried out, as well as a rationalization of existing
infrastructure (stores, warehouses, maintenance shops) that was designed
more for the needs cf a refinery operation than for a secondary recovery
operation.
4.25      The preparatory work for a secondary recovery project in the Brea
Parinas area will be undertaken by a qualified consulting engineering firm
with extensive experience in secondary recovery; PETROPERU's Exploration and
Production department will supervise the work of the consultants. A short-
list of qualified consulting firms was drawn up by PETROPERU in November 1979
and an invitation to submit proposals will be sent to each firm in December.
It is expected that PETROPERU will sign a contract by January 1980, with work
on the feasibility study and the basic engineering starting shortly afterwards.
4.26      Finally, the proposed review of PETROPERU's financial and adminis-
trative management systems will be undertaken by a qualified consulting firm
with prior experience in evaluating financial management systems of both
national and private oil companies. The terms of reference for this study
will be mutually agreed upon between PETROPERU and the Bank, and the review
will be completed by June 30, 1980.
Project Costs
4.27      The total cost of the project is estimated at US$50.7 million of
which US$32.5 million, or 64%, represents the foreign exchange component; this
estimate is based on 1979 prices. Customs duties and taxes are estimated at



- 32 -
about US$5.3 million. Physical contingencies have been estimated on the basis
of an overall composite 12% rate for equipment, materials and consultancy
services. This contingency factor has been derived on the basis of 8% rate
for pumping equipment and seismic contracting services and a higher 20% rate
for drilling materials, other surface and subsurface equipment, and consultancy
services where the volume, scope and costs are less well defined. Engineering
services have been calculated on the basis of unit costs of US$9,000 per man-
month, which approximates actual costs for similar services recently financed
under Bank loans. Price escalation has been calculated on the basis of a 9%
inflation rate during 1980 and 1981. Local cost estimates have been calculated
in US$ equivalent on the assumption that internal inflation rates in Peru will
be matched by continuous adjustments to the exchange rate which reflects
Peru's exchange rate policy.
4.28      Estimated costs of the projects are summarized below:

Project Financing Plan
4.29      The total estimated cost of the project, US$50.2 million equivalent,
including physical and price contingencies, is expected to be funded as
follows:
Local              Foreign
Currency             Currency            Total          (%)
PETROPERU              18.2                  -                 18.2         (36)
IBRD                     -                  32.5               32.5         (64)
TOTAL       18.2                  32.5               50.7       (100)
Bank funds will cover 64% of total estimated financing requirements and 100%
of the foreign exchange component. PETROPERU will finance all local currency
expenditures.
4.30      It is proposed that the Bank loan be made to PETROPERU with the
guarantee of the government at the current lending rate plus a guarantee fee
for a period of 17 years, including 3 years of grace. The principal equipment
items for the two rehabilitation components i.e. 1 (a) and 1 (b), are pumping
units, subsurface equipment, and electro-centrifugal pumping units 1/ which
have, on average, a uiseful productive life of at least 20 years; oil reserves
in the Talara area and in the jungle are sufficient to sustain production for
at least the same period. For the seismic component it is not feasible to
relate this investmenat to the useful productive life of any discovery that
may result. Though the recent past exploration success in this area indicates
that the prospect for new discoveries are promising with further drilling,
uncertainty exists as to the timing of any benefits derived from the seismic
work; this would argue for longer term financing. On the basis of the above
considerations, and in view of PETROPERU's need for longer term financing
given its high debt servicing payments through 1982, and the critical impor-
tance of being able to sustain a modest exploration program, a loan term of
17 years, including 3 years of grace is recommended. In addition, because
Peru faces medium term balance of payments problems which are expected to
become serious at the time repayment of the proposed loan will begin, it
should receive as much financing as possible on longer terms.
Disbursement and Allocation of Bank Loan
4.31      The proposed Bank loan of US$32.5 million would finance the following
items:
(i)  100% of foreign expenditures and 80% of local expenditures for
pumping equipment, surface and subsurface equipment, drilling
equipment, and other imported materials related to the following
project subcomponents:
1/   Repair/replacement of the motor (5% cost) will be required every 2 years.



- 34 -
1) installation "artificial lift" in the jungle (1(a))
2) reactivation 300 wells Talara (1(b))
90% of total expenditures (representing the estimated foreign
exchange component) for Seismic party services related to
subcomponent 2(a) would also be financed under the proposed
loan.
(ii)  90% of total expenditures for consultant's services carried
out in connection with project sub-components 1(a), 2(b) and 3,
and 100% of foreign expenditures for training;
(iii)  No disbursements would be made under project sub-component
l(b) pending Bank review of a satisfactory preparative plan
(paragraph 4.11); no disbursements would be made for expen-
ditures for the second phase of seismic party services under
2(a) without comprehensive discussion of seismic results
(paragraph 4.16);
(iv)  Retroactive financing up to the amount of US$2.0 million
would be made for equipment orders placed after February
1, 1980 in respect of 1(a) and 1(b), as well as for seismic
party services (2(a)) and consulting services (2(b)) con-
tracted after the same date. These equipment orders (i.e.
pumping units) are urgent since production has been declining
sharply from a number of wells. PETROPERU has already financed
the purchase of some pumps from its own funds and is depending
on the Bank loan to help finance the continuation of the pump
installation program.
Disbursement of the Bank loan is expected as follows:
(US$ Million)
1980        1981      1982
Incremental                   5.0        16.6       11.0
Cumulative                    5.0        21.5       32.5
The loan would be fully disbursed by December 31, 1982.
Procurement
4.32      Equipment and materials, as well as the seismic party services, to
be financed by the Bank loan will be procured by international competitive
bidding procedures following Bank guidelines. Contracts for: (a) drilling
materials and surface and sub-surface equipment other than pumps; (b) the
first 17 pumps to be acquired for the jungle operations (1(a)); and (c)
processing and reprocessing of seismic data, may be awarded after soliciting
price quotations from suppliers or contractors satisfactory to the Bank from



- 35 -
not less than three member countries and Switzerland; provided, however, that
the aggregate amount of contracts so awarded shall not exceed US$3 million.
Qualified local suppliers and members of the Latin American Free Trade Associa-
tion participating in international competitive bidding would be accorded a
preference of 15%, or the prevailing duty, which ever is lower.
Project Risks
4.33      The risks associated with the project are those inherent in petro-
leum production. The extensive production history of the Northern coastal
and jungle fields establishes a high degree of confidence in the recoverable
reserve estimates and in the reservoir behaviour of each of the producing
fields. PETROPERU has considerable operating experience in the I'alara coastal
area and in supervising seismic surveying in the jungle, so that little
difficulty is anticipated in carrying out the reactivation of 300 temporarily
abandoned wells or the seismic work program.
4.34      There is some risk in the installation of artificial lift systems
for PETROPERU's jungle operations where PETROPERU has just recently been
acquiring experience with electric submersible pumping equipment. Teething
problems in the efficient use of this equipment, and more particularly in the
specialized maintenance and repair work which will be required, will inevit-
ably arise. In order to reduce such risks, the Bank has provided funds for
financing the ongoing technical services of the suppliers of this equipment to
train PETROE'ERU's field personnel in a comprehensive maintenance program; in
addition, the funds could be used to finance experts from Occidental's nearby
operations who also have experience in the use of artificial lift. With this
technical expertise provided for, PETROPERU's existing staff would be capable
of implementing efficiently each of the project components. It is possible
that the seismic program may not detect structures that warrant subsequent
exploratory drilling,, or that the drilling of such structures does not result
in commercial oil discoveries. However, given the recent prospecting success
in the Peruvian jung'Le, the potential benefits in detecting new oil bearing
structures through a more comprehensive seismic coverage of these areas, far
outweigh the risks inlvolved.
Training
4.35      PETROPERU 'has lost many of its experienced engineering and operating
personnel in the past two years. Recently recruited operating personnel, as
well as less experienced supervisors, will receive training in standard
reservoir engineering practices and production control procedures.  In addi-
tion, the acquisition of new equipment facilities will necessitate training
programs for PETROPERU's field staff. Overseas visits to specific equipment
suppliers and to facilities using equipment of the kind included in the
project will also be! required. Approximately 60 man months of staff time
has been allocated for this purpose.



- 36 -
Environmental Considerations and Safety
4.36      No major environmental risks are likely to result from implementa-
tion of the project. PETROPERU's crude oil from the jungle is highly saline
in content and has to be treated, both physically and chemically, before
transportation by pipeline. The residual formation water, which has a salt
content on average of 100,000 PPM, is discharged into the Rio Corrientes,
whose flow fluctuates between 300 cu.m. per second and 1,000 cu. m. per
second. Fish, however, are not affected adversely because of the rapid
dilution of the salt water. During the frequent heavy rainstorms in the
jungle local oil spills in the vicinity of the production facilities occa-
sionally give rise to a thin film of oil in the Rio Corrientes. While
these films are rapidly dispersed in the fast flowing rivers of the area,
PETROPERU's is endeavouring to reduce the frequency of such occurrences.
PETROPERU's overall safety record has been good and safety practices routinely
used are in accordance with acceptable industry practices.
Schedule and Reporting
4.37      The proposed project is scheduled to be completed by December 31,
1982. During negotiations agreement was reached with PETROPERU to submit
quarterly progress reports on progress of each of the project subcomponents.
V. FINANCIAL ASPECTS OF PETROPERU
A.   PETROPERU's Past Financial Performance and Present Position
5.01      Following an initial period of financial stability, PETROPERU's
financial situation started to deteriorate sharply after 1973. This dete-
rioration was due primarily to three factors: first, a government policy
of subsidized domestic prices following the increase in international crude
oil prices in 1973; second, the growing tax obligations which PETROPERU
paid on behalf of the contractors which reached a high point in 1978
when production from the jungle increased sharply and Peru started to
export again crude oil and products; and third, the large debt servicing
payments 1/ which began to fall due in 1978, almost all of which were
denominated in strong foreign currencies, at a time when the Peruvian sol
was undergoing frequent devaluations. By the end of 1978, the company's
financial position had become so precarious that it found itself not
only unable to meet its burgeoning tax obligations but faced the prospect
of defaulting on the large debt servicing payments that were due in 1979.
The financial indicators summarized below show the deterioration that has
taken place since 1974.

US$1,079 million in 1977; in 1978 and 1979, PETROPERU would have incurred
a net loss if the contractors' tax obligations had been calculated as in
previous years.
5.02      A summary of PETROPERU's financial position in FY74 through FY78
and of its estimated position as of December 31, 1979, is given below:

As is apparent from the above, PETROPERU has had a seriously undercapitalized
and deteriorating f:Lnancial structure for several years, attributable to the
large investment program undertaken in the first part of the decade which was
financed almost exc:Lusively by debt; by end 1978, the total debt/equity ratio
was 92/8.



- 38 -
5.03      In early 1979, with PETROPERU's financial difficulties mounting,
GOP set about remedying the causes of the company's financial weakness by
preparing a phased recovery program. Subsequently, important steps were
taken to strengthen PETROPERU's position and to ensure its ability to meet
debt-servicing payments throughout the remainder of calendar year 1979. These
steps included (i) the government's agreement to assume the servicing of that
component of PETROPERU's external debt i.e. US$388 million, that had accrued
from the financing of subsidies to the domestic market for imported crude oil
and petroleum products during the 1973-78 period; (ii) the government's
agreement to provide substantial equity infusions; (iii) frequent domestic
price increases 1/; and (iv) a reassessment of the overall taxation system
affecting PETROPERU and the sector, a review which was completed and made
official on December 6, 1979.
B.   PETROPERU's Future Finances
5.04      In late July 1979, during discussions with GOP it was agreed that
PETROPERU's future financial position, after 1979, would be projected with a
view to:
(a)  Assuring a minimum debt-servicing capability, especiaLly
in the critical period 1980-83 when large debt payments
fall due;
(b)  further strengthening PETROPERU's capital structure through
debt relief and equity infusions; and
(c) ensuring PETROPERU's future cash generation through improve-
ments in profitability to enable it to resume its exploration
activities.
5.05      Financial Covenants.  The specific measures required to achieve
these objectives have been discussed and agreed with GOP during negotiations
and incorporated in the following financial covenants:
(i) GOP shall make the following contributions to PETROPERU's
equity for the purpose of servicing debt: (a) US$45 million
during fiscal year 1980; (b) US$45 million in 1981; and
(c) US$30 million during fiscal year 1982. These contribu-
tions may be made pursuant to the provisions of Decree-Law
22775, 2/ or from other sources as shall be determined by GOP.
1/   From January 1978 to October 1979, GOP has increased domestic prices on
five different occasions. On September 1979, a 10% increase was approved
by the Government, and on January 1980 an additional 11% increase was
also approved.
2/   Which provides that the income tax collected from petroleum companies
operating in Peru will be provided to PETROPERU as an equity contribu-
tion to finance capital investments.



- 39 -
(ii) In addition to (i), GOP shall (a) issue a Supreme Decree which
would make official an equity infusion to PETROPERU of about
S/15,500 miLlion effective January 2, 1980, amount equivalent
to the March 1979 principal payments to JAPECO and Wells Fargo
Bank (already complied with); and (b) issue a Supreme Decree that
would make official the taking over by the Peruvian Treasury of
about S/25,000 million of PETROPERU's short-term obligations to
the Banco de la Nacion related to losses effectively borne by
PETROPERU because of earlier price subsidies which have not yet
been refunded by GOP. Issuance of the latter Decree would be a
condition of effectiveness.
(iii) GOP shall increase ex-refinery domestic product prices on a
quarterly basis by 10% (in soles) in 1980 1/. Thereafter, the
GOP shall use its best efforts to carry out a pricing policy
whose objectives will be to eliminate all subsidies andi enable
PETROPERU to self-finance a reasonable portion of its invest-
ment program. To this end, GOP, to the extent possible, will
maintain consumer and domestic ex-refinery prices in real
terms taking into account the rate of domestic inflation or
increases in the purchase price of crude oil by PETROPERU for
the domestic market, whichever is greater, and make additional
increases to domestic prices in order to reach international
price levels. In addition, GOP shall, not later than 30 days
before the end of each fiscal year, review with the Bank the
pricing policy for the year in question and the actions GOP
intends to take to carry out such policy during the next fiscal
year, taking into account the pricing studies to be carried
under the proposed loan.
(iv) PETROPERU Shall maintain, at all times, a minimum quick ratio
(current assets excluding inventories divided by current liabil-
ities) of 0.6 in 1980, 0.7 in 1981, 0.9 in 1982, and 1.0 in 1983
and thereafter.
(v) Except as shall be otherwise agreed between the Bank and
PETROPERU, PETROPERU shall not incur any medium and/or long
term debt if, after the incurring of such a debt, PETROPERU's
debt/equity ratio would be greater than: 75/25 in fiscal
year 1981, 70/30 in 1982, and 60/40 in 1983 and thereafter.
No debt/equity limitation has been provided for 1980 ,given
uncertainties on timing of planned equity contributions.
I]n respect of fiscal year 1980, GOP may withdraw profits from
PETROPERU in an amount that shall not be greater than the posi-
tive difference, if any, obtained by deducting from the aggregate
amount of GOP's contribution to PETROPERU's equity made during
L980, the amount of the proceeds of such contributions used for
purposes c,f servicing PETROPERU's debt.
1/   Slightly higher than the current projected annual inflation level for
1980 of 40%.



- 40 -
(vi) PETROPERU shall maintain a minimum debt service coverage ratio
of 1.1 in 1980, 1.4 in 1981, 1.9 in 1982, and 2.0 thereafter.
If at the time of the Bank's periodical review of PETROPERU's
financial performance, its debt service coverage ratio did not
meet the agreed targets, GOP would agree to take appropriate
measures, satisfactory to the Bank, so as to bring debt service
coverage to the agreed level. In addition, PETROPERU shall
furnish to the Bank, not later than 90 days after the beginning
of the year, a program of action for purposes of maintaining
the applicable debt service coverage ratio throughout such
Fiscal Year.
(vii) PETROPERU shall undertake and implement, with the help of
consulting firm(s) acceptable to the Bank, first, an indepth
study of its fixed assets including physical counting and book
reconciliation; second, a study aimed at modernizing PETROPERU's
overall accounting, budgeting, as well as improving information
requirements throughout the company. Consultants for the second
study will be appointed not later than August 31, 1980. The
first study will be completed not later than August 31, 1981,
and the second not later than October 31, 1981 (paragraphs
3.14 and 4.19).
(viii) PETROPERU would have its accounts audited by independent
auditors and would submit to the Bank each year, beginning
in 1980, and no later than five months after the end of
the fiscal period an external audited report of its
financial statements.
(ix) PETROPERU would closely collaborate with its external
auditors in resolving qualifications raised on previous
accounts no later than the end of fiscal year 1981.
(x)  PETROPERU would annually review with the Bank its capital
investment program and related financing sources by a date
no later than September 30 each year, starting in 1980.
(xi)  GOP would provide PETROPERU with a short-term credit line
until December 31, 1981, to cover any deficit in working
capital. Based on PETROPERU's audited accounts for the
year 1981, GOP and the Bank will exchange views on the
convenience of a GOP's contribution to PETROPERU in an
amount adequate to cover its working capital needs. If
such exchange of views shows such a convenience, GOP shall
take all such action as be necessary to make such equity
contribution.

5.06      Projected Financial Results - General.  When reviewing PETROPERU's
financial projections it should be noted that GOP has recently issued
(December 7, 1979) the new basis for future exploration/production agreements
in the petroleum sector (para 2.30), and announced its intention to renego-
tiate existing contracts to adapt them to the new basis. Formal negotiations
with Belco started in. late January 1980 and are proceeding and negotiations
with Occidental are supposed to begin shortly; but the outcome of negotiations
on some of the key parameters (particularly, the crude oil production split
between PETROPERU and. each of its contractors) is unknown. The financial
projections are predicated on the Government taking the specific measures
mentioned in para 5.05, and on the assumption that PETROPERU would maintain
at least the actual crude oil production split. Based on discussions with
PETROPERU and the Government, this latter assumption is reasonable, and even
if the assumed produc:tion split is less than expected, there is a cushion for
PETROPERU to be able to meet the financial covenants and even to attain the
financial projections through faster price increases 1/. The assumptions in
regard to production, revenues, operating costs and international crude oil
prices are summarized below and discussed in detail in the annexes.
5.07      Production Schedule.  Peru's future crude oil production has been
based on the projected output from PETROPERU and the contractors' currently
producing oil fields over a 10 year period. In addition, output resulting
from three secondary recovery projects planned in the Talara area have also
been considered. Overall output is 5% lower than official government esti-
mates for the period 1980-82, 10% for 1983-85, and 15% for 1986--89. Peru's
production schedule is summarized below:
PERU: CRUDE OIL PRODUCTION SCHEDULE
(Average Production for the Period in MBPD)
1980-82    1983-85    1986-89
PETROPERU's production                       63.6        78.3        55.9
Contractors' production                     152.7       151.6        120.7
Peru's total production                 216.3       229.9       176.6
5.08      Revenue and Operating Cost Estimates.  For the next ten years,
unless new oil discoveries are made, PETROPERU will derive a gradually
increasing proportion of its projected revenue from domestic sales, with
1/   Domestic prices have been increased yearly only by the forecast domestic
inflation rate..



- 42 -
exports comprising a correspondingly smaller proportion of gross revenues.
Revenue estimates for the year 1979 indicate gross sales of about S/.227.7
billion (US$1,012 million) of which 48% would be local sales and 49% exports.
The export contribution to PETROPERU's gross revenues would steadily decline
over time reflecting (a) an internal demand for petroleum products growing at
an estimated rate of 4% p.a. until 1983 and at 5% p.s. thereafter, and (b)
declining crude oil production. By the year 1985, PETROPERU would generate
55% of its revenue in the local market and only 43% through the export of
crude oil and products.
5.09      Spot market prices for crude oil in 1979 are projected to average
US$26.82, based on prices realized by PETROPERU through July 1979. Crude oil
prices for subsequent years, in current terms, have been assumed to reach
US$38.07 per barrel in 1985, and US$46.27 by 1989. Detailed prices and
assumptions are given in Annex 5-6. Operating costs estimates are based on
actual data made available by PETROPERU. PETROPERU's operating cost structure
has three main components: costs related to PETROPERU's own operations,
local purchases of crude oil from contractors and, tax payments to GOP made
by PETROPERU on behalf of its contractors. 1/ Annex 5-1 shows in detail
PETROPERU's projected operating costs.
5.10      Financial Projections:  PETROPERU's finances were projected taking
into account the financial covenants outlined in paragraph 5.05 and on the
assumptions mentioned in paragraphs 5.06-5.09.
(a)  Period 1980-1985:  The following table provides a summary
of PETROPERU's future finances (in current soles) for the
period 1980-1985, and is taken from the detailed income
statements, statements of sources and uses of funds and
balance sheets as given in Annexes 5-2 to 5-5.
1/   These tax payments (import and export duties and royalties and cannons)
to GOP are considered as the cost to PETROPERU for its share of the
contractors' crude oil production.

/a   Taking into account equity injections from GOP for the sole purpose of ser-
vicing debt.
The projections indicate that PETROPERU's overall financial
position would improve over the four years FY80-83. Due to
larger prof-its and to Government equity contributions, to be
provided under the new Law from contractors' income taxes,
PETROPERU's capital structure would be strengthened from a
debt/equity ratio of 92/8 in 1978 to 37/63 by 1983. PETROPERU's
current liquidity position would also improve by 1983 when the
quick ratio is projected to reach 2.0. Finally, the rate of
return on assets would steadily increase from an estimated
level of 3.5% in 1979 to 6.5% by 1983; thereafter, the rate of
return wou:Ld gradually decrease as a result of the decreased
volume of crude oil available for export, the revaluation of
of PETROPERU's fixed assets which would have taken place, and
substantiaL additions to fixed assets that would not yield
over the period 1980-85 but, subsequently, cost savings and/or
increase in crude oil production.
(b)  Period 1985-1990:  After 1985, PETROPERU's financial position
will depend primarily on its ability to increase crude oil
clutput. Assuming that no discoveries are made either by
PETROPERU, the existing contractors or new contractors,
E'ETROPERU's own production plus its share from the contractors
wrill not be sufficient to cover domestic demand from 1985
onwards. As a consequence, the financial projections beyond
1985 would show a gradual deterioration in PETROPERU's main
financial indicators. If on the other hand, modest discoveries
were to be found as appears likely (given the expected increase
in exploration activity by existing and new contractors and by
E'ETROPERU, which will now have more resources for this purpose),
IPETROPERU's financial position would be consolidated beyond 1985.



- 44 -
5.11      Sensitivity analyses show that variations in Peru's oil production
schedule is the critical factor affecting PETROPERU's key financial indica-
tors, and that PETROPERU's ability to slightly increase overall oil output 1/
would be the most influential factor in consolidating its finances from 1985
onwards. In addition, international oil prices increases would benefit
PETROPERU's finances during the first half of the 1980s when the country
will be a net exporter of crude oil. If no discoveries are made, PETROPERU's
own production, plus its share from the contractors, would not be sufficient
to cover domestic demand after 1985; as a consequence, PETROPERU would have
to supply an increasing proportion of the domestic market with crude oil
purchased at international prices. To cover the eventuality that no new
discoveries are made, and the possibility that higher increases in inter-
national prices occur, GOP would have to adjust at a faster pace domestic
and ex-refinery prices in accordance with PETROPERU's weighted average pro-
duction costs in order to reach international price levels (para. 5.05, iii).
VI. ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ANALYSIS OF THE PROJECT
6.01      The two production rehabilitation project components will provide
an increase in petroleum production of 30 million barrels of crude oil over
the first ten years of the project's life. The seismic component will result
in a more extensive seismic coverage of two known producing areas of the
Peruvian jungle which is expected to lead to the detection of new structures
with oil bearing potential. The subsequent drilling of these structures,
which would take place shortly afterwards, could lead to further discoveries,
with new oil reserves being brought into production in a relatively short
period.
6.02      The benefits of the two production components can be measured by the
increased foreign exchange earnings and savings that they will make possible.
The economic rates of return are extremely high, primarily because of the
incremental nature of the investments. In both cases the projects can take
advantage of existing infrastructure; the wells have already been drilled,
the reserves are well established, and the transport pipeline systems are in
place with unutilized capacity. In addition, oil price increases over the
past several years have dramatically increased the profitability of all
production enhancement petroleum projects. In fact, had PETROPERU been
in better financial condition, these investments would have already been
implemented, as they were viable projects at petroleum prices considerably
lower than those that prevail today. It is not possible to quantify precisely
the benefits derived from the seismic survey component. However, a comparison
1/   In the order of 10% over actual estimates.



- 45 -
with Occidental's high success rate in exploration drilling following detailed
seismic work in Block lB (which borders on the north-western reaches of
PETROPERU's Block 8), makes it likely that new structures will be detected as
a result of the proposed seismic work program in Block 8 too, and that these
in turn would lead to new oil discoveries, so increasing the level of Peru's
proven oil reserves. An analogous argument can be made for the seismic work
in Block 31 which has; been in production for 40 years and which warrants a
more extensive seismic coverage.
Production Rehabilitation Components
(i) Northwestern Coast
6.03       This investment will increase production by about three million
barrels over the project life, assuming that three hundred wells are put back
into production, thal: the average well output is 3.5 barrels per day per well
during the first year (total 383,250 barrels), and that output declines by 5%
per year (i.e. 1916 barrels per year) over the ten year life of the project.
When crude oil is vaLued at US$25.85 per barrel in real terms throughout the
project life and the annual incremental operating costs are 20% of the invest-
ment cost, the economic rate of return of the project will be over 100% and the
payback period 0.8 years (see Annex 6-1).
6.04       A sensitivity analysis shows that an increase in capital costs of
50% would decrease the rate of return to 95%, and that combined with an
increase in the rate of decline in output from 5% to 10% per year (38,325 b/y)
would decrease the rate of return to 88%.
6.05       I'he incremental financial rate of return of this component is 20.85%,
considerably lower than the economic return to Peru, because of the taxes
levied on PETROPERU's operations. It has been assumed that the incremental
production will be exported at a conservative price of US$25.85 per barrel in
real terms. Details; on the incremental financial costs and benefit streams
are given in Annex 6-2.

(ii) Jungle Operations
6.06      For a capital cost of US$11.7 million, this project component will
increase output from the jungle fields by 27 million barrels over the project's
life.  Production will be increased by 60% from about 27,000 b/d 1/ to about
44,000 b/d at the beginning of 1981, and is expected to fall by about 20% per
year thereafter (see Annex 6-3 for details for production and operating costs).
Since the total investment takes less than one year to come on stream (and
in fact output will increase incrementally with each pump placement), the
economic rate of return will be well over 100%. The financial return to
PETROPERU is also well over 100% and the pay-off period less than two months.
A sensitivity analysis shows that because the rate of return is so high that
no reasonable set of alternative assumptions brings the return down below 100%.
VII. SUMMARY OF AGREEMENTS REACHED
7.01      Assurances were obtained from the Government during negotiations
that:
(a)  the competitiveness of PETROPERU's salaries will be
maintained throughout the implementation of the project
(paragraph 3.10);
(b)  GOP would increase domestic ex-refinery prices by 10% per
quarter during 1980. Thereafter, the GOP shall use its
best efforts to carry out a pricing policy whose objec-
tives will be to eliminate all subsidies in order to
eventually reach international prices, and enable PETROPERU
to self-finance a reasonable portion of its investment pro-
gram;
(c)  GOP shall make the following contributions to PETROPERU's
equity for the purpose of servicing debt: (a) US$45 mil-
lion during fiscal year 1980; (b) US$45 million in 1981;
and (c) US$30 million during fiscal year 1982;
(d)  GOP would provide PETROPERU with a short-term credit line
until December 31, 1981, to cover any deficit in working
capital. Based on PETROPERU's audited accounts for FY81,
the Government and the Bank will exchange views on the
convenience of a GOP's contribution to PETROPERU in an
amount adequate to cover its working capital needs. If
such exchange of views shows such a convenience, GOP
shall take all such action as be necessary to make such
equity contribution;
1/   Assumes that current production will increase from its present level
of 20,000 b/d to 27,000 b/d once temporary difficulties with initial
pumping units are overcome.

(e)  in respect of fiscal year 1980 the GOP may withdraw profits
from PETROP'ERU in an amount that shall not be greater than
the positive difference, if any, obtained by deducting from
GOP's contribution to PETROPERU's equity in 1980, the amount
of the proceeds of such contributions used during such year
for purposes of servicing debt (paragraph 5.05, v); and
(f)  GOP undertakes to establish a committee composed by high
representatives of the Ministries of Energy and Mines and
Economy and Finance, PETROPERU and COFIDE, responsible for
coordinating the carrying out of the sector investment and
pricing studies, and would exchange views with the Bank on
the findings (paragraph 4.21).
7.02      Assurances were obtained from PETROPERU during negotiations that:
(a) PETROPERU shall undertake and implement, with the help
ofE a consulting firm acceptable to the Bank, an in depth
study of its accounting and information procedures (para-
graph 3.14 and 5.05 (vii));
(b) PETROPERU would have its accounts audited by independent
auditors and would submit to the Bank each year, beginning
in 1980, and no later than five months after the end of the
fiscal period, an external audited report of its financial
statements and project accounts (paragraph 5.05 (viii));
(c) PETROPERU would closely collaborate with its external
auditors in resolving qualifications raised on previous
accounts no later than the end of the fiscal year 1981;
(d) F'ETROPERU would annually review with the Bank its capital
investment program and related financing sources by a date
not later than September 30 each year, starting in 19130
(paragraph 5.05 (ix));
(e)  PETROPERU would retain a minimum debt service coverage
ratio of 1.1 in 1980, 1.4 in 1981, 1.9 in 1982, and 2.0
thereafter. If at the time of the Bank's periodical review
of PETROPERU's financial performance, its debt service coverage
ratio did not meet the agreed targets, the GOP would take
appropriate measures, satisfactory to the Bank, so as to
bring debt- service coverage to the agreed level (paragraph
5.05 (vi)');
(f) PETROPERU will submit monthly progress reports on each of
the project components (paragraph 4.37);
(g) PETROPERU shall maintain, at all times, a minimum quick ratio
of 0.6 in 1980, 0.7 in 1981, 0.9 in 1982, and 1.0 in 1983 and
thereafter;



- 48 -
(h)  the fixed assets inventory and book reconciliation will
be completed not later than August 31, 1981; and the study
aimed at modernizing its accounting, auditing and information
requirements will be completed not later than October 31, 1981
(paragraph 3.14); and
(i)  PETROPERU shall not incur any medium and/or long term debt
if, after the incurring of such a debt, PETROPERU's debt/
equity ratio would be greater than: 75/25 in fiscal year
1981, 70/30 in 1982, and 60/40 in 1983 and thereafter.
7.03      A condition of loan effectiveness would be that the Government
shall issue a Supreme Decree which would make official the taking over of
about SI. 25,000 million of PETROPERU's short-term obligations (paragraph
5.05 (ii).
7.04      A condition of disbursement would be (a) that following completion
of the first phase of seismic work, a comprehensive discussion of the seismic
results and interpretation with Bank staff would take place before any
detailed seismic survey is undertaken (paragraph 4.16); and (b) that the
preparation of component l(b) is reviewed by Bank staff (paragraph 4.11).
7.05      With satisfactory resolution of the items outlined above, the proj-
ects constitutes a suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$32.5 million. The
term of the loan would be 17 years, including a grace period of 3 years.

ANNEX 2.01
THE PERUVIAN MODEL CONTRACT
The Peruvian Model Contract is basically a production-sharing
contract in which oil production at the well-head is divided between PETROPERU
and the contractor. All the investment has to be provided by the contractor,
including the concomitant risk, without any counterpart contribution by
PETROPERU. The precise oil split between the PETROPERU and the contractor
is determined by the contract, which is normally on a 50/50 sharing basis.
PETROPERU undertakes to pay the contractors' principal Peruvian tax obliga-
tions (i.e., income, remittance, export, and import taxes) out of its share
of the oil, with the exception of some minor taxes on company assets. The
duration of the contract can vary: exploration and development contracts have
an average duration of 30 years, compared to 15 years for secondary recovery
projects. Contractors' work obligations are clearly specified on a yearly
basis in the agreement, and in the event the contractor relinquishes its block
before completing the agreed work program a pre-determined penalty payment
would have to be paid. Despite some difficulties related to the magnitude
and flexibility of the work obligations and the more recent cormplications
between the U.S. contractors and the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
regarding the eligibility of certain taxes paid by PETROPERU for a foreign tax
credit, the Peruvian Model Contract is an extremely easy agreement to monitor.
It does not require GOP to examine the books of foreign subsidiaries operating
in Peru and oil companies currently active in Peru-Occidental and Belco are
satisfied with the Model.  However, reservations have been expressed by U.S.
companies on the implications of a possible change in the Perurian tax regime
vis-a-vis the U.S. I.R.S.

RESERVE POTENTIAL OF PETROPERU'S NORTHERN JUNGLE FIELDS
Corrientes
The Corrientes field (also known as Trompeteros) is located close
to the Corrientes River in alternately dry and swampy terrain. To date, 26
wells have been drilled of which 21 are producing; well productivity varies
between 300 to 4,000 b/d. Corrientes has an estimated 140 million barrels
of recoverable oil; approximately 16.5 million barrels had been recovered by
the end of 1978.
Pavayacu
The Pavayacu field is located between the Corrientes and Tigre
rivers to the northeast of Corrientes (see map). The nearby terrain is
drier but also more hilly. Fourteen wells have been drilled of which 12
were producing in February 1979, giving rise to a total production of 2,500
b/d. At the beginning of April 1979, three electrical centrifugal pumps were
installed which increased production almost immediately to 9,700 b/d. Because
the production from the reservoir was greater than the capacity of the pumps,
it was necessary to "choke" the wells until pumps with greater capacity were
obtained. Total estimated recoverable reserves from Pavayacu are 25 million
barrels, of which 1.2 million had been produced by the end of 1978.
Capirona
This field is also located on the Corrientes River to the south of
Pavayacu. The terrain is dry but less hilly than Pavayacu. Five wells have
been drilled so far, one of which has been abandoned; total production from
the three wells, currently in production, is on the average, 600 b/d. Total
recoverable reserves are estimated to be 6.1 million barrels of which 0.3
million had been recovered by the end of 1979.
Yanayacu
The field is located on the right bank of the Rio Maranon. The
terrain is swampy which makes operations extremely difficult in the area.
Twelve wells have been drilled so far of which 10 have been producers.
Currently all the wells are shut down due to the very low production from
the field (32 b/d) caused by the low energy available in the reservoir and
the physical characteristics of the crude, 170 API and 3,000 SSU viscosity.
This field has an estimated volume of recoverable reserves of 13 million
barrels of which 0.44 million barrels have been recovered so far.

Notes and Assumptions on Financial Statements
The financial projections have been made on the basis of the crude
oil production schedule and projected operating costs detailed in Annexes 5-1
and 5-2 and the assumptions indicated below:
1.        Prices.  Average spot market prices for crude oil in 1979 are
projected to average US$28.20, and are based on spot market prices realized
by PETROPERU through July 1979. Spot market prices for subsequent years have
been assumed to retain a 10% premium over and above the highest OPEC posted
price for crude sold under long-term contracts (i.e., US$23.50 per barrel as
July 1979). In this regard, it has also been predicated that OPEC prices
under long-term contracts would remain linked to the US dollar inflation rate.
Ex-refinery prices for petroleum products sold in the domestic
market in 1979 (GOP controlled prices) are projected to average US$0.24 per
gallon. Domestic prices for subsequent years were assumed to increase at a
rate of 10% p.a. in real dollars during the period 1980-82, and to remain
linked to the dollar inflation rate thereafter.
Assumed spot market price for crude oil and ex-refinery domestic
prices for the period 1980-1985 are shown in the table below:
PETROPERU: PRICE ASSUMPTIONS (Current Terms)
1980   1981   1982   1983   1984   1985
Spot market prices $/bbl 1/         28.18  30.15  31.96  33.88  35.91  38.07
Ex-refinery domestic prices $/gl   0.26   0.29   0.33   0.35   0.37   0.39
1/ Constant in real terms at US$25.85 per barrel.
2.        Administrative and Selling Expenses related to PETROPERU's activi-
ties have been projected to be S/.33.3 billion (US$148 million) in 1979 and
are based on actual costs provided by PETROPERU. Administrative and selling
expenses for subsequent years have been assumed constant in real terms.
3.        Depreciation has been calculated according to the schedules approved
and authorized by the Peruvian Internal Revenue Service summarized below:
Annual Depreciation %
(Straight Line)
Machinery and equipment                                 10
Transportation equipment                               20
Talara's refinery and fertilizers' plant                5
Pampilla's refinery                                     4
Pipelines                                               6.7
Buildings and civil constructions                        3

4.        Asset Revaluation.  PETROPERU's revaluation practices apply to all
its non-fully depreciated assets with associated outstanding debt: denominated
in foreign currencies. The yearly revaluation amount of each specific item
is, therefore, related to the increase of its outstanding debt obligations due
to variations in the exchange rate of the sol and each specific currency over
the preceding fiscal year.
5.        Taxes.  It has been assumed that PETROPERU's overall tax obligations
would be computed in accordance with the recently issued Supreme Decree 22775,
that assimilates the petroleun sector into the General Tax Code of Peru.
6.        GOP Equity Contributions to PETROPERU will amount to US$45 million
in 1980, US$45 million in 1981, and US$30 million in 1982. An equity contribu-
tion of about US$62 million effective January 2, 1980 has also been assumed.
In addition, GOP would appropriate, to comply with the new legislation, yearly
equity contributions to PETROPERU on the amount of its contractors' income
taxes, estimated at a yearly average of about US$200 million for purposes of
capital investment pIrojects.
7.        Debt Related to Crude Oil Imports During the Period 1973-78.  Short
term debt incurred by PETROPERU to finance petroleum imports in the period
1973-78 amounted to ',/.85.4 billion (US$380 million), of which S/.25.9 billion
(US$115 million) has already been repaid to the external creditors. The GOP
has agreed to (a) assume the servicing of the outstanding portion of this debt
i.e., principal repayments of S/.8.5 billion in 1980, and S/.17.0 billion in
each of the years 1981, 1982 and 1983, and; (b) to transfer to E'ETROPERU the
portion already repaid to the external creditors by equivalent reduction in
PETROPERU's 1979 tax payments.
