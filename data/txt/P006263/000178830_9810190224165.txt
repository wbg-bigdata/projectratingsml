INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE
PRESIDENT TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
THE FEDERATIVE REPUBLIC OF BRAZIL
FOR THE LOWER SAO FRANCISCO POLDERS PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Federative Republic of Brazil for the equivalent of US$23
million to help finance the Lower Sao Francisco Polders Project. The loan
would have a term of 25 years, including five years of grace, with interest
at 8-1/2% per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An economic report, entitled "Economic Position and Prospects of
Brazil" (355a-BR), dated June 20, 1974, was distributed to the Executive
Directors on July 3, 1974. Country data sheets are attached as Annex I.
An economic mission visited the country in October/November 1974 and'its
report is in preparation.
3.        The Brazilian economy grew by 9.6% in 1974 continuing the rapid
pace which began in 1968. The average rate of growth of about 10% over
the period 1967-74 has resulted in a 60% increase in per capita. income, a
130% increase in manufacturing output and a 350% increase in the value of
exports. During much of this period, with carefully designed fiscal and
monetary policies, the Government was successful in gradually reducing the
rate of inflation. Some overheating of the economy developed in 1973. While
initially the price effects of this were conttained by administrative action,
there was a fairly sharp increase in prices during the first half of.1974
as a result of the reLaxation of controls and higher import prices. Inflation
in 1974 was about 29%, compared to an annual average of 18% in 1970-73.
4.        Recent international economic developments have caused a sharp
deterioration of Brazil's balance-of-payments performance. The fourfold
increase in the price of crude oil (adding some US$2 billion to the import
bill), the steep rise in the price of most imported raw materials, as well
as the hardening of terms of external financial credits, made management of
the external sector very difficult in 1974. Further, these external factors
caught Brazil at the time when its economy was overheated and growth of import
demand was very high because of limitations on domestic capacity in key sectors
coupled with inventory accumulation. The current account deficit which
averaged US$1 billion in 1969-73 or 2% of GDP, widened to about US$7 billion
or 7% of GDP in 1974, refleoting the sizeable differential between import
growth (about 100%) and e.pDrt growth (roughly 30%). The bulk of the
deficit was financed by a large increase in the inflow of external
financial credits (about US$3.7 billion on a net basis). However, starting
in September 1974 the tight international market for long-term funds brought



-2-
about a slowdown in the flow of financial credits and there was a
moderate drawdown of reserves (about US$1 billion) in the latter part of
the year. Nevertheless, Brazil began 1975 with reserves of a reasonably
comfortable US$5.7 billion.
5.         Measures to cope with the new external situation began in March
1974, when a new government came into office. The first efforts of the
new economic team were directed a-t restoring control of aggregate demand
to reduce the current account deficit of the balance of payments to more
manageable levels and to halt the acceleration of inflation. The main
ins-truments used to achieve these goals were the implementation of a more
restrictive monetary and fiscal program, the imposition of higher import
duties and acceleration of the "crawling peg't exchange rate adjustments.
Indicati, s of a tapering off of the rate of industrial expansion and of
inflation since the third quarter of 1974, as well as of a decline in
imports in early 1975, suggest that the Government policies have begun
to take hold.
6.         The Government is committed to a substantial reduction of the
balance-of-payments current account deficit in 1975. To this end, it
intends to continue monetary restraint, a balanced budget and a realistic
exchange rate policy, and to reduce stockpiles of imported intermediate
goods accumulated by public enterprised during 1975.   The balance-of-payments
outlook for 1975 is more favorable because prospects for most Brazilian
exports continue to be good, a slowdown in import price increases is expected
and an increase in domestic oil production is likely, thanks to earlier
discoveries of offshore deposits in some Northeast states. The Government's
plan to reduce the trade deficit to about US$2.5 billion in 1975, compared
to US$4.6 billion in 1974, should be attainable if imports can be kept at
the same level as in 1974. However, the expected decline in the trade
deficit in 1975 will be partly offset by a substantial increase in interest
and amortization payments as a result of the large external borrowing
contracted during 1974. The current account deficit would be approximately
US$5.4 billion. With expected long-term capital flow, US$4.8 billion would
remain to be financed through a combination of financial credits and
utilization of reserves.
7.         In recent years, Brazil has become more closely integrated into
the world economy and its growth has become more dependent upon and vulnerable
to changes in the world economic situation. The slowdown in the rate of growth
of the world economy could have an adverse impact on prices of Brazilian
primary exports and on the rate of growth of its exports of manufactures.
World economic conditions will probably not permit Brazil to grow during
1975-80 at the 10% pace attained in the preceding years. In fact, considerably
slower growth is likely during 1975-76 with the very steep deuline in OECD
economic activity, However, a growth path averaging 6% per annum still seems
feasible over the 1975-80 period. This pace of growth would result in an
annual average current account deficit of US$4.6 billion (US$3.5 billion in
1974 prices). In financing this deficit, Brazil is likely to look more than



-3-
ever to multilateral lenders, not only because loans from other sources
on good terms may be somewhat less available than in the past but also
because multilateral lenders can act as catalysts to help mobilize other
sources of financing. It is estimated that to finance the projected growth
path, the average annual net inflow of medium- and long-term capital (that
is, capital other than direct investments and financial credits) required
for the 1975-80 period will be substantial, about US$1.8 billion, or three
times the average for the 1970-74 period. On the other hand, the direct import
needs of most public investment projects are relatively low, reflecting
the ability of the domestic capital goods industry to compete successfully
under international competitive bidding and the low direct foreign exchange
component of many projects with strong social impact. Hence, an appreciable
part of official external financing would have to be made available to cover
domestic expenditures if Brazil is to achieve its growth targets.
8.         By the end of 1974, Brazil's total external debt (public and
private) reached US$17.4 billion, of which two-thirds or US$11.6 billion,
was in the form of financial credits. Despite the large increases in the
level of indebtedness, Brazil's external liquidity steadily improved up
to 1974. Extension of the average term of financial credits and virtual
elimination of short-term credits had a favorable impact on debt structure.
Together with a rapid increase in exports, this resulted in a decline in
the total debt service ratio from 44% in 1971 to 31% in 1974. The public
debt service ratio for 1974 is estimated at around 17%, which is in line
with that of other countries at a similar stage of development. Further,
net foreign exchange reserves as of the end of March 1975 were still large,
about US$4.9 billion, equivalent to some four months of the expected 1975
imports of goods and non-factor services. If an export growth rate of
around 17% per year in dollar terms (compared to 30% in 1970-74) can be
maintained over the 1975-80 period and if average maturities on new financial
credits gradually improve from six to eight years, the total debt service
ratio in 1980 can be expected not to exceed the level prevailing in the
1969-73 period (about 38%). The ratio for public debt alone would remain
at the present level of around 17%. Nonetheless, the fact remains that
Brazil's external debt service obligations are high. However, the large
foreign exchange reserves accumulated over the past several years ensure
that Brazil will have the liquidity to meet its debt service obligations
in the short term, while the country's record of high caliber financial
management provides grounds for confidence in the maintenance of credit-
worthiness over the longer run.
9.         There has been a remarkable broadening and deepening of the
country's productive base and of its infrastructure in recent years, as
well as a considerable strengthening of its external sector. However,
despite its recent growth and vast potential, Brazil is still a country
with a very unequal distribution of income and extensive absolute poverty.
The present Government acknowledges the gravity of the country's income
distribution problem and accepts the responsibility for its alleviation.



-14-
While like the previous Government it believes that a high rate of
growth is necessary to increase the incomes of the poor, it does not
believe that the "trickle down" effects of rapid growth are enough
and is in the process of shaping a new positive policy which could be
labeled as "redistribution along with growth." To this end, in addition
to pursuing some of the social programs initiated by its predecessor, the
Government is also working on new measures for improving income distribu-
tion. These can be classified into three broad areas: (a) regional develop-
ment; (b) provision of social services; and (c) wage policy.
10.       As to regional development policy, the Government has formulated a
program known as POLONORDESTE, described in para 24 below for rural develop-
ment in the Northeast. Active consideration is being given to a major
modification in the state value added tax system to redistribute fiscal
resources, from the richer to the poorer states, in order to give the latter
the fiscal resources which they badly need to accelerate social programs,
particularly in education. As to the provision of social services, the
Government has created a new Ministry of Social Security in order to
consolidate its social benefit programs and to extend these programs to
new groups in the population. It is also planning to strengthen the nutri-
tion program which, under the old Government, got off to a poor start.
Greater emphasis is being given by BNH (the National Housing Bank) to low-
income housing, whose beneficiaries will enjoy better financial terms than
in the past. BNH is also developing a site,and services program to reach
parts of the population even lower down the income scale. In agriculture,
the recently reorganized rural extension agency (EMBRATER) will expand
and strengthen its activities directed specifically toward the small-scale
farmer; and the newly established federal agriculture research institution
(EMBRAPA) is defining its program to include a selection of crops and farm
systems which will ensure that small-scale farms benefit from research
efforts. Overall, the Government's recently approved public investment
program for 1975-77 gives high priority to education, health, agriculture
and regional development, which account for about 30% of total public invest-
rdent, Finally, the Government intends to use wage policy to improve income
distribution or at least to avoid its further deterioration. It has already
revised the formula governing the adjustment of the union wage scale and
has introduced an 8-10% increase in the real minimum wage.
PART II - BANK OPERATIONS IN BRAZIL
Bank Operations
11.        By April 30, 1975, Brazil had received 52 loans from the Bank
amounting to US$2,164.5 million, of which 32 have not yet been fully
disbursed. During FY65-69, disbursements averaged only US$10 million



- 5 -
per year, increasing to an average of US$136 million per year during
FY70-74, and reaching US$225 million in FY74, and US$187 mlllion in
the first nine months of FY75. Disbursements will continue to
increase during the next few years. Annex II contains a summary
statement of Bank loans as of April 30, 1975 and notes on the execu-'
tion of ongoing projects.
12.       Bank lending to Brazil was very active in FY72, when seven
loans were approved totalling US$437 million, including three loans
totalling US$192 million for the Stage II expansion of the steel industry.
In FY73, six loans amounting to US$187.7 million and, in FY74, three
loans totalling US$242 million were approved. Thus far, in FY75, three
loans to Brazil totalling US$308.6 million were approved. At an advanced
stage. of preparation are two loans that would help finance the further
expansion of Brazil's flat steel industry. We are also working on the
preparation of an integrated rural development project in the Northeast
state of Rio Grande do Norte, an agricultural research program, a
nutrition project, second grain storage and agro-industries projects, a
small- and medium-sized industry credit project, a secondary and feeder
road project, a project in support of the establishment of a non-flat
steel enterprise, a project to rehabilitate and expand the Sao Paulo
state railway enterprise and an electric power distribution project in
the Northeast.
13.       Brazil's external public debt outstanding and disbursed at the
end of 1974 totalled US$9.1 billion, and of this amount the Bank held
9.6%. The Bank's share of the service on this debt was about 403%. If
present trends continue as expected, the Bank's share in total public
debt outstanding would increase to 12% by 1980. The Bank's share of
public debt service would rise to about 6% while its share of Brazil's
total external debt service would remain at the present level of 2.7%,
IFC Operations
14.       IFC has committed more financial resources to Brazil than to
any other country. Since 1957, IFC has made 26 commitments to Brazil,
totalling US$252.9 million, of which US$32.5 million has been cancelled,
US$14.7 million repaid and US$126.9 million sold. Of the balance of
US$78.8 million, US$56.3 million represents loans and US$22.5 million
represents equity. A summary of IFC's investment up to March 31, 1975,
is given in Annex II.



-6-
Lending Strateg
15.      In its lending to Brazil, the Bank has sought to help the
Government achieve a number of important development objectives, which
are interdependent and complementary. One of these objectives is to
support the growing effort of the Governrnent of Brazil to alleviate
poverty, increase gainful employment and redistribute income    In order
to assist the Government in providing social services and initiating
a gradual process of land reform, we are identifying and supporting
projects designed to increase productivity and incomes of the rural
poor. The proposed Lower Sao Francisco Polders project would contribute
to several of these efforts. In the future we hope to present an in-
creasing number of loans with sirailar objectives.
16.       A second Bank lending objective in Brazil is to support
institutional development and policy reform, designed inter alia to help
maximize public savings and ensure that they are used economically. One
important activity of this type is the substantial Bank assistance to
the transportation sector, directed to the rational selection of investments
and the reduction of railway operating deficits. Our lending in the steel
sector is givingthe Government support in following a comprehensive and
rational plan for the development of the national steel industry. It is
also helping the borrowing enterprises to improve their management and
organization.
17.       Another important lending objective for the Bank has been to
help Brazil ease the foreign exchange constraint on its development, a
constraint that has become more critical since the increase in petroleum
prices, by supporting projects designed to increase Brazil's export
capacity and, where economical, to substitute domestic production for
imports. Much of the investment in the transport sector -- railways,
ports and highways -- is designed to facilitate the smooth and economical
flow of exports. The grain storage and agro-industries projects are
both export oriented. These investments should help Brazil make a
material contribution to the alleviation of the world food shortage.
Support of the steel expansion program is helping Brazil develop output
of a commodity which can be produced efficiently in Brazil owing to the
country's bountiful supply of high-grade iron ore and the scale of its
internal iarkets.
18.       Finally, all of the Bank's loans to Brazil provide part of the
very large volume of medium- and long-term capital inflows that Brazil
has needed and will continue for some years to need in order to sustain
rapid growth and achieve its employment creation and regional development
objectives. In some sectors, especially in electric power and steel, the
Bank's participation has helped Brazil obtain additional bilateral resources
on reasonable terms.



-7-
PART III - NORTHEAST AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
Bank Participation in Brazil's Agricultural Sector and in the Northeast
19.       The proposed loan for the Lower Sao Francisco Polders project
would be the Bank's sixth loan for the development of Brazil's agricultural
sector. The Bank made two loans, totalling US$66 million for livestock
development; two, amounting to US$84 million, in support of agro-industry
and grain storage credit programs; and one for US$6.7 million for the Alto
Turi Land Settlement project in the State of Maranhao. The proposed loan
would be the second one, after the Alto ruri project, for the agricultural
and rural development of the Northeast of Brazil. However, it would be
the first project in Brazil to contain irrigation and agrarian reform
components.
20.       For the past few years, an effort has been made to increase the
Bank's activities in the Northeast. Two special economic missions visited
the region, in 1972 and in 1974, and have helped us to acquire a more
thorough knowledge and understanding of the problems of the region, and
to identify and help prepare projects directed towards lower income groups,
especially in agriculture. In 1972, loans were approved for an agricultural
and technical education project (part of which was located in the North and
the Northeast) and a land settlement project in the State of Maranhao. A
second education project was approved in late 1974, to help implement part
of the educational reform in eight different states of the Northeast. The
Development Research Center has continued a joint research effort with
SUDENE, the Northeast Develqpment Superintendency, on the nature of small-
scale farming in the Northeast. In July 1974, the Bank established a
liaison office in Recife to assist in the preparation of integrated rural
development projects.
Sector Background
21.       The Northeast of Brazil, with a population of 30 million
(about 30% of Brazil's population) has for many generations had the
largest concentration of poverty in Latin America. Its rural per capita
income is approximately one-fourth of Brazil's overall per capita income
(US$610) in 1972. Sixty percent of the population lives in the rural
areas and agriculture provides about 33% of the regional GDP. Agriculture
is relabively diversified, the main activities being the commercial
production of sugarcane and cocoa in the Zona da Mata, cotton and sisal
in the semiarid zones and the subsistence production of rice, beans, corn
and manioc throughout the region. During the 1961-71 decade, agricultural
production grew at an average annual rate below 4%, with growth mostly
attributable to the increase in cultivated areas, especially in the
frontier states where new areas could be colonized readily. Sugarcane,
cotton, manioc, corn, beans and cocoa accounted for 65% of the total value
of crop production in 1972, and for 79% of the cultivated area. Agricul-
tural yields in the region are generally low, some 25% below the average
yields in Brazil; primitive production techniques, an inadequate extension
service, insufficient economic and social infrastructure, and weak public
institutions have kept agricultural productivity low despite considerable
efforts towards improvement.



- 8 -
22.       Rural poverty in the Northeast is the result of a complex
environment in which the effects of unfavorable ecological conditions --
semiarid weather and scarcity of fertile lands -- are compounded by
problems emerging from concentration of ownership and associated share-
cropping and renting arrangements. Rural incomes and farmers' productivity
seem to be closely related with farmers' control over the factors of
production. For the region as a whole, farms with less than ten hectares
represent almost 70% of the total number of establishments but amount to
less than 6% of the total area; less than 40% of agricultural land is
exploited directly by owner-operators. Most of the land is cultivated
by landless farmers who account for up to 80% of the rural labor force --
be they sharecroppers or renters. The risk of eviction discourages farm
investments. Landholders, and particularly larger farmers, also tend
to have more control over other productive factors, and greater access to
modern'inputs and to markets, Credit agencies usually require that land
or potential production be pledged as security for loans, which a priori
excludes sharecroppers from receiving credit from institutional sources.
Even small landowners often do not qualify for institutional credit, and
most of thema must be considered to be as deprived as the sharecropper and
renters. The Government has recently recognized that special efforts
should be made to help them through integrated rural development projects.
Institutional Support
23.       Thus far, few of the existing agricultural services -- research,
credit or extension -- have been organized to assist the small farmers.
'This is due mostly to the past orientation of the Government's agricultural
policies toward the promotion and establishment of large and commercially
oriented agricultural enterprises as the main investment for developing
the agricultural sector. It was feared that small-farmer programs would
absorb considerable public expenditure without a commensurate increase in
production. It was also assumed that large-scale agriculture would generate
more employment opportunities to absorb redundant or low productivity
agricultural labor than any program to assist small farmers directly.
24.       The Government of President Geisel, which assumed office in
March 1974, has reformulated agricultural policy. On the one hand it has
established a goal of 40h real increase in agricultural output for the
1975-79 period, with the aim of making Brazil one of the world's foremost
producers and exporters of foodstuffs. On the other hand, acknowledging the
gravity of the country's income distribution problem, especially in the
Northeast, the Government has initiated programs designed to improve small
farmers' productivity, including the POLONORDESTE program, which envisages
investment expenditures of about US$700 million during 1975-79, and is designed
to raise the productivity and incomes of small farmers through, inter alia,
formulation and execution of integrated rural development projects, including
changes in land tenure. POLONORDESTE is based on the assumption that the rural
Northeast cannot be regarded as a homogeneous whole and, therefore, uniform
standardized programs are inadequate. The Government has further launched
a social development program for the Northeast, calling for expenditures of
US$17 billion equivalent during 1975-79 for education, nutrition, water supply,
low-income housing and urban development.



- 9 -
25.      Given the complexities of the region, the early stage of most
of these programs and the need to define an adequate institutional envi-
ronment, little has been accomplished so far to help the rural poor, and
progress is bound to be slow. It should be expected that many of the
projects or rural development programs will be somewhat experimental.
However, given the new direction in Government policy, and if the projects
under preparation, once completed, demonstrate that the Governmnent's new
approach can achieve both distribution and productive ends, intensive
Bank support in this field would be warranted.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
26^       The Lower Sao Francisco Valley is that part of the Sao Francisco
River basin lying downstream of Pao de Acucar where the river leaves the
narrow gorge below Paulo Afonso and moves into broad flood plains, called
varzeas (see map 11560). This portion drains 33,000 km2 representing about
5% of the total river basin area. The project is mainly concerned with
the varzeas which are found in 18 riparian municipalities in the States
of Sergipe and Alagoas, on both sides of their common boundary, the Sao
Francisco River, and with adjoining areas on the levees and terraces
(combros) and uplands (tabuleiros)(see map 11565).
27.       The population in the project area was 213,000 in 1970, 58% of
which was classified as rural. Seventy-four percent of the economically
active population is engaged in the primary sector, which, except for a
small number of fishermen, is almost exclusively agricultural. Levels
of income in the Lower Sao Francisco region in 1968 and 1969 were around
US$80 per capita per year, being only 50% and 72% of the average income
in the States of Sergipe and Alagoas as a whole and 65% of that for the
Northeast of Brazil. Rice is the main crop in the varzeas, while cotton,
subsistence crops such as maize and beans are grown on the lower part of
the combros, and small plantations of coconuts, oranges, bananas and mangoes
on the upper part. Conditions are much less favorable on the tabuleiros
because of lower soil fertility and greater irregularity in the rainfall,
which make rainfed agriculture a risky undertaking.
Objectives of the Project
28.       The proposed project would be an integral part of the Bank's
support to the effort of the Government of Brazil to alleviate poverty,
increase gainful employment, redistribute income and increase small
farmers' productivity. The project would also offset the adverse effects
on agriculture in the Lower Sao Francisco Valley resulting from the com-
pletion of hydroelectric facilities at Sobradinho and Paulo Afonso, which
are being partly financed under the Bank's loan of US$81.0 million of June
1974 (No. 1008-BR). The effects of the Sobradinho-Paulo Afonso complex
on the Lower Valley were specifically recognized in the Loan Agreement
(Loan 1008-BR) for the Paulo Afonso project.



- 10 -
a)  The minimum flow of the river will increase from 700m3/s
to 2,000m3/s which, in the absence of countermeasures,
would permanently flood about 3,000 ha of varzea rice
land.
b)  The frequency and magnitude of flooding will be reducrd,
which would decrease the area flooded 80% of the time
(which is the area used for rice) by about 11,000 ha
from a total of about 16,000 ha.
c) Daily fluctuations in the river levels due to turbine
peaking will be as much as 1 to 2 meters.
d) During a prolonged drought all floods would be elimi-
nated for periods as long as 58 consecutive months.
Some time ago, the Government of Brazil through the Superintendencia do
Vale do Sao Francisco - SUVALE (now replaced by the Companhia de
Desenvolvimento do Vale do Sao Francisco - CODEVASF), its agency respon-
sible for agricultural development in the Sao Francisco Valley had started
planning for the protection and development of the varzeas. Resettlement
of the population elsewhere, on rainfed lands, was determined unfeasible
and of much higher cost: from US$8,000 to US$12,000 per family, depend-
ing on the distance moved, the land to be settled, and the services ren-
dered. For the 11,000 families in the area in question the total cost
of resettlement would therefore work out at US$90-130 million, or vastly
more than the cost of the proposed project.
29.        With the completiop of the works at Paulo Afonso forecast for
early 1978, the urgency of protecting the varzeas in the Lower Valley is
increasing as time passes. At the same time, there is an excellent oppor-
tunity to go further than simply the emergency works, and to proceed with
full development in the area. Under the proposed project, two of the
varzeas will receive land redistribution, a full irrigation scheme per-
mitting double-cropping of rice, some road and social infrastructure,
technical and organizational assistance, components which should promote
the balanced social and economic development of the target group, and make
the productive investment fully effective. FUll development of only
two major varzeas is included in the proposed project, which should therefore
be viewed as a first phase project. A second phase, which would benefit
from the experience gained during implementation of this project, would be
prepared for Bank financing a few years from now.
Directly Productive Components
30.        Emergency Works.  The basic protection plan for the vdrzeas would
be the provision of dikes and dual purpose irrigation/drainage pumps, and



- 1.1 -
maintenance equipment. The complete seasonal flooding of the varzeas
for irrigation would be maintained artificially, thus permitting farming
to continue with existing cultural practices. The area to be protected
includes 32,000 hect.ares of which 13,490 hectares are used for rice
production. In addition, the Government is implementing a plan for the
construction of protection works in two other varzeas, Propria and Itiuba,
for a gross area of 3,130 ha. Only half of the small varzeas have
sufficient land to justify the cost of protective works, and the inhabitants
(perhaps as many as 1,000 farmers) of the remaining varzeas and of a few
small islands near the mouth of the river will have to be resettled. Feasibil-
ity studies for protecting small varzeas would be submitted for Bank review
prior to initiation of any construction work.
31.        Internal irrigation and drainage systems necessary for the
"full development" of 1,OO ha in Marituba and 3,400 in Betume.   Irrigation
would be by gravity through unlined canals, but a small area of sprinkler
irrigation would be provided in the Marituba varzea to establish the
feasibility of the method on the undulating combro lands.
32.        Land Redistribution.  At present, about 7% of the farms occupy
about 82% of the land., while less than 100 owners control practically 90%
of the land in the project area, although the degree of concentration of
land ownership varies from varzea to varzea. If the land were left in
the hands of the present proprietors, the new production potential result-
ing from the construction of emergency dikes and pumping stations would
cause the price of protected lands to increase substantially. There would
also be an accelerated tendency toward mechanization of rice cultivation,
threatening the employment and livelihood of some 11,000 sharecropping
families. In order to prevent 'such windfall profits from accruing to a
few large landowners, to protect the employment opportunities of the
sharecroppers, and to provide farms to farmers displaced from small varzeas
or islands for which it would be uneconomical to build up emergency facilities,
all the lands in the project have been recently declared by Government Decree
(No. 75,482) to be subject to expropriation. This has frozen land prices.
CODEVASF employed a similar procedure successfully when starting the protec-
tion works on the varzeas of Propria and Itiuba.
33.        CODEVASF has five years to take physical possession of all the
land in the project area. The present owners of farms could continue to
use the lands or could rent out these lands for use by others until they
are needed.for full development. The land would be redistributed in stages.
Under the present project, 5,900 ha, or 18% of the varzea area protected
in the project would be redistributed in the varzeas of Ma'rituba and Betume.
Although the Bank would not disburse against iand acquisition costs, all
plans for land redistribution would be developed in consultation with the
Bank. In determining farm sizes, three main criteria would be used: i) a
minimum family income; ii) full utilization of family labor with as little



- 12 _
hired labor as possible; and iii) resettlement within the varzeas of
the maximum number of families compatible with (i). About 75% of the
new farms would have about 2.5 ha of rice land plus 0.5 ha of irrigated
combro land.   Following the approach already used by CODEVASF in 1973
in the Propria and Itiuba varzeas, the land would be redivided, leased,
allocated or sold to present varzea qualified farmers, possibly utilizing,
in some cases, some form of cooperative ownership; the final solutions
will be adapted to the individutal farmers selected to receive the new
farms.
3l4.       For the farmers who do not qualify for resettlement (for health,
age or other reasons), the Government would prepare plans acceptable to
the Bank to ensure their livelihood.
35.        Technical and Management Services.  Extension services would be
reorganized to focus on the need to assist small farmers in the varzeas
and the tabuleiro pilot project (see para 37) especially in the organizational.
marketing and technical aspects of rice and other crop production.
36.        Fish Production.  To prevent a drop in fully developed varzeas in
fish production, which is the present source of protein food and income for
many of the varzea residents, the project would include about 50 ha of
demonstration fish ponds, 1 ha to 2 ha in unit size; 150 ha of artificial
ponds, 1 ha to 10 ha in area; 60 ha of natural ponds of varying sizes, and
60 ha of 0.5 ha ponds on small farms, which wpuld utilize the drainage water
from rice fields. Production would begin in the second year and would yield
about 200 tons of fish annually.
Indirectly Productive Components
37.        The project would finance training for CODEVASF staff as well as
continuation of the field experimentation program undertaken since 1968 by
SUVALE in the project area. The experimentation program would include the
recruiting of additional staff, the training of extension workers and
progressive farmers, the expansion of the experimental farm in the Marituba
pilot project area which would cover rice and combro land, and the evaluation
of the agricultural potential of the tabuleiro lands in a pilot area near
Penedo. In addition, the project would include a seed production and certifi-
cation program to produce the seeds required by the project, and fry collection
centers and fish hatcheries to conduct research on fish species.
38.        An economic and social infrastructure component would also be
included, mainly for the two varzeas which will be brought immediately
to full development. Sixty kilometers of feeder roads would be upgraded
and 34 km of new roads built; water supply systems would be provided for
eight villages, serving about 4,000 persons; 13 new elementary school
classrooms would be built and present school facilities upgraded benefit-
ing about 2,500 pupils and trainees on a two-shift basis; rural electricity
systems would be installed serving about 5,000 persons; for villages other
than new villages created for the settlers, electricity and water facilities
would not be installed unless residents were willing to contribute to the
capital costs.



- 13 -
39.        Finally, the project would finance the preparation of a
detailed Master Plan Feasibility Study, which would be the basis for
an integrated rural development project for the Lower Valley Region.
It would include the surveys and designs for full development of the
varzeas that will only benefit from emergency works under this project,
and the cadastral surveys for the land acquisition and redistribution
components of this project.
Cost Estimates and Financing
4o.        Total project costs would amount to US$52.6 million equivalent,
including land acquisition costs and physical and price contingencies, but
excluding US$3.9 million of interest during construction. These costs are
broken down as follows:
Project Components
1975 uS$ Equivalent       %
('000)
Emergency Dikes and Pumping Stations (Incl.O&M)    13,160            25.0
Full Development of Marituba and Betume (excluding
emergency works)       6,860            13.0
Maintenance Equipment                               1,500             2.9
Fish Production                                       510             1.0
Technical and Management Services                     760            1.4
Resettlement                                          500             1.0

Physical and Social Infrastructure                  1,550             3.0
Surveys and Technical Assistance                   4,540             8.6
Project Monitoring                                    120              .2
Physical and Price Contingencies                   15,110            28.7
TOTAL                       52,610           100.0
The foreign exchange component of the foregoing project costs is estimated
at US$15.3 million, assuming as is likely, that most major construction
contracts would be won by Brazilian contractors.



-14-
41.        The proposed loan of US$23 million would cover 36% of project
costs, including the foreign exchange component of US$15.3 million and
about US$3.8 million of local costs, plus the US$3.9 million of interest
during construction. The inclusion of a modest amount of local expenditure
financing is justified by the considerations set forth in paragraph 7 above.
Project Execution
42.       The planning for the protection and development of the varzeas
was initiated by SUVALE, a semiautonomous agency responsible for planning
and development in the Sao Francisco Valley. In July 1974, SUVALE was
transformed into the Companhia de Desenvolvimento do Vale do Sao Francisco
(CODEVASF), a public sector enterprise under the Ministry of Interior which
would be the entity responsible for the execution of the proposed project.
CODEVASF's structure should facilitate project implementation. Although
its headquarters are in Brasilia, it will be decentralized. The regional
headquarters for the project would be at Aracaju, the capital of Sergipe.
CODEVASF is not restricted by the civil service salary scale and has made
provisions to recruit and retain a highly competent technical staff, which
should benefit from the training component of the project and from a UNDP
project for technical assistance training in irrigation which will begin
in late 1975. This should permit the satisfactory implementation of the
present project, as well as ensure the efficient preparation and necessary
continuity for a second phase.
43.        CODEVASF receives most of its funds for operating programs from
the federal budget. It would contract out to private firms the details
of project plan preparation, supervision and project construction. CODEhVASF
would have authority to acquire lands for public need and social interests
in accordance with existing expropriation laws, and under a decree (No. 75,482)
published on March 17, 1975, it was specifically authorized to acquire, divide
and resell in family-size units, to small holders and landless farmers, the
lands which are the subject of the present project.
Procurement
44.        Contracts for the construction of the emergency dikes and pumping
stations and for the civil works needed for full development of the Marituba
and Betume varzeas would be awarded on the basis of international competitive
bidding in accordance with Bank guidelines for procurement. The Government
is proceeding with the detailed designs and engineering for the dikes and
pumping stations, and in 1975 will advertise for construction bids. Dike
construction work has already been started under a negotiated contract at the
Boacica varzea. In order to proceed on schedule with the construction and
completion of dikes and pumping stations in other varzeas CODEVASP may
award further contracts following Bank guidelines before loan signature.



- 15 -
45.        Equipment and vehicle purchases would be grouped together,
where feasible, and when the aggregate value of a group exceeded US$50,000
equivalent, awards would be made on the basis of international competitive
bidding. When the value was less, procurement would be based on competitive
bidding advertised locally and in accordance with CODEVASF's normal procedures,
which are satisfactory. Competitive bidding advertised locally would also be
followed for the award of contracts for minor civil works and buildings,
feeder roads, and social infrastructure components, provided that total
expenditures for such works and purchases would not exceed US$3.6 million
equivalent.
46.        Domestic manufacturers whose bids contain components manufactured
in Brazil equal to at least 50% of the value of the bids as defined in
accordance with Brazilian law would be allowed a preferential margin of
15% of the c.i.f. price, or the prevailing tariff, whichever is lower.
Procurement of consultant services would follow Bank guidelines.
Disbursements
47.        The proceeds of the proposed loan would be disbursed to cover
40% to 50% of the civil works, consultant and other professional services,
100% of the c.i.f. cost or ex-factory cost of equipment for civil works,
mechanical and electrical equipment for punping stations, imported or
locally manufactured but procured under international competitive bidding,
75% of local expenditures for off-the-shelf imported items, plus 100% of the
interest on the Bank loan during construction. Expenditures incurred on
design, construction and equipment of dikes and pumping stations would be
eligible for retroactive financing up to US$3 million, provided that the
contracts are let after March 17, 1975, the date of the land acquisition
decree. Loan disbursements would be expected to extend until December 31,
1979 (see Annex III).
Economic Evaluation and Project Benefits
48.        Since the construction of the main protective works and the
resettlement of people from small varzeas and islands, where protective
works are not justified, are necessary to offset the adverse effects
caused by the construction of the upstream hydroelectric power works,
these construction and resettlement costs have not been charged to the
project for the purpose of calculating the rate of return, but have been
imputed to the costs of hydroelectric power generation. Including the
work already done to protect the Propria and Itiuba varzeas, they would
amount to approximately US$25 million. These costs would be borne by
power consumers and would be reflected in power rates. Given the small
fraction represented by these costs in CHESF's overall investments, the
difference in power rates would be extremely small. Only the developmental
costs in the Marituba and Bet.ume varzeas, including irrigation works, farm
investment costs and technical farm inputs, plus part of the infrastructure
and technical assistance costs, have been counted in calculating the economic
rate of return of the proposed project. Family labor costs were also included
in the calculations since they represent a substantial part of on-farm
operating costs. The economic rate of return calculated on this basis
would be 16%o



- 16 -
49.         The principal benefit of the project would be the protection
of 32,000 ha of prqductive land, of which more than 13,000 ha would be
used for rice cultivation. Not only would the former production level
be maintained in all the varzeas, but, through the introduction of double
cropping and of technical inputs in the two fully developed varzeas, an
incremental production of 25,000 tons of paddy is expected, over and
above a current level of produietion of 22,000 tons.
50.        Very substantial benefits would accrue to the new farmers --
be they sharecroppers or small landowners -- whose family income would
increase on average, from US$200 to US$1,800 by the sixth year. The
incremental family income due to land reform alone would range approximately
from US$200 to US$570. The financial return on farm investment would range
from 25-31%.
51.        In addition to land payments, farmers would pay water charges
to recover the difference between the costs for the full irrigation develop-
ment and the costs of an emergency protection system only. These charges
would fully cover operation and maintenance costs and permit the recovery
of investment costs over a period of about 35 years without interest (see
Section 2.11 of Project Agreement). The charges would represent an average
of 24% of incremental farm income, which is considered the maximum consistent
with the project's income objectives.
52.        The project would also include a major employment benefit; 18,000
permanent jobs would be protected and 4,800 seasonal ones would become
permanent jobs; 1,900 new farms would be created; landless farmers would
become owners of their own farms; and a number of amenities would be made
available to a substantial portion of the population of the valley, in-
cluding schools, health centers, potable water supply and electricity.
The technical assistance and research components of the project should
benefit not only the long-term development effort in the Sao Francisco
Valley, but would also provide valuable experience applicable in other
areas of Brazil with respect to land reform, tabuleiro development, and
integrated rural development project elaboration and implementation.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
53.        The draft Loan Agreement between the Federative Republic of
Brazil and the Bank, the draft Project Agreement between CODEVASF and the
Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section h(iii)
of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a draft resolution approving
the proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately. The major features of the draft Loan and Project Agreements
have already been described in this report.
54.        I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION I/
(As of May 16, 1975)
There are now 31 effective Bank loans under disbursement:
Loan No.
403/474   Estreito Hydroelectric Project:   US$57 and US$39 million loans
of February 26, 1965 and December 19, 1966; Closing Date:
December 31, 1976. The project is completed and the loan
is almost fully disbursed. Equipment costs were substantially
below estimates.  The original Closing Date was April 1, 1971.
404       Xavantes Hydroelectric Project:   US$22.5 million loan of
February 27, 1965; Closing Date:   June 30, 1975.  The original
project was completed in early 1971 (after a delay of about 18
months).  The project had been amended to include the installa-
tion of equipment for an associated transmission line. In March
1972, US$2.7 million was cancelled from the remainder of the
loan. Ordering and the proposed delivery of the latter equipment
were delayed, but the loan is now expected to be fully disbursed
by April 30, 1975. The original Closing Date was December 31,
1969.
565       Porto Colombia Hydroelectric Project:   US$22.3 million loan
of October 23, 1968; Closing Date: March 31, 1975. Changes
in the project layout and design have increased substantially
the local cost, which will be covered by ELETROBRAS, without,
however, significantly affecting the economic justification
for the project. Construction work is completed. Retention
payment schedule is under review to determine the period of
postponement of the Closing Date.
566       Volta Grande Hydroelectric Projlect:  US$26.6 million loan of
October 23, 1968; Closing Date: June 30, 1975. The project
was delayed six months by spillway foundation difficulties.
This problem and price escalation greater than estimated
increased powerhouse construction cost by 72%, but, as the
original cost was very low, the resulting cost per kW of
generating capacity is still attractive. The project is
virtually completed and the fourth and last generating unit
is expected to be in commercial operation shortly.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Loan No.
656       Industry:   US$25 million loan of February 16, 1970 to Banco
do Nordeste do Brasil (BNB); Closing Date: June 30, 1975.
The loan has been fully committed. The Terminal Date for sub-
mission of subprojects, originally June 30, 1972 and postponed
to June 30, 1973, was postponed a second time to June 30, 1974
to give BNB an opportunity to submit subprojects in an advanced
stage of preparation. Slow utilization of the loan was due
mainly to BNB's unusually burdensome security conditions on
subloans and its emphasis on larger scale projects, for which
financing from other than World Bank funds has been available.
676       Second Highway Construction Project:    US$100 million loan of
May 25, 1970; Closing Date:- July 31, 1975. Construction works
are underway and the overall quality of construction and super-
vision is satisfactory. There have, however, been substantial
cost increases on some contracts, so that the total construction
cost of the project is now estimated to be above the appraisal
estimate, excluding contingencies, but still within the appraisal
estimate including contingencies. The execution of some contracts
has been seriously delayed by inclement weather conditions and
project changes. Disbursements under the loan are behind the
appraisal schedule, due to a late start of the project, but have
improved during the last two years. The original Closing Date
was July 31, 1974.
677       Marimbondo Hydroelectric Project:    US$80 million loan of May 25,
1970; Closing Date: May 31, 1977. Construction work is proceeding
on schedule. The cost of increased excavation and concrete work
resulting from poor rock foundation and increased equipment cost
will result in an increase over the original cost estimate of
US$65 million or 24.5%. This does not significantly affect the
economic justification for the project.
728       Salto Osorio Hydroelectric Project:    US$70 million loan of April 5,
1971; Closing Date: May 31, 1977. The construction of the Salto
Osorio hydroelectric plant is progressing satisfactorily. A cost
overrun of about US$72 million, due to increased equipment and
construction costs, is foreseen, but this does not significantly
affect the economic justification of the project. The cost overrun
is being financed by loans from ELETROBPAS and a commercial bank.
The construction of the transmission system, delayed to allow a
re-examination of ELETROSUL's market, is proceeding with corres-
ponding modifications.

Loan No.
755       Education Project:   US$8.4 million loan of June 21, 1971; Closing
Date: December 31, 1975. Progress on the construction and equip-
ment of the project schools is now proceeding satisfactorily.
However, the project implementation is behind the original schedule
due to initial delays.
756       Santos Port Project:   US$45 million loan of June 21, 1971; Closing
Date: June 30, 1979. Execution of the project is now proceeding
satisfactorily, although there have been further delays and cost
overruns which will be financed by the Borrower. DNPVN, with the
assistance of management consultants, has been improving port
operations in Santos. The National Port Development Study financed
under the project is nearly completed. The Government is studying
legislation which would conlert DNPVN from a Government agency to
a public corporation.
757       Sao Paulo Water Supply Project:    US$22 million loan of June 21,
1971; Closing Date: June 30, 1976. The project suffered initial
delays caused by the State of Sao Paulo not furnishing the required
counterpart funds which are now included in the state budget. The
Government has consolidated all the'water and sewerage companies
in the state into a single company, SABESP, and a loan assumption
agreement with the new company was concluded on December 18, 1974.
During the last four months progress has been slow but improvements
are expected with new management of the company which took office
recently. The original Closing Date was June 30, 1975.
758       Sao Paulo Pollution Control Project:    US$15 million loan of June 21,
1971; Closing Date: June 30, 1976. A review of the original
design resulted in its modification to exclude the discharge of
raw sewage including a treatment facility. Bidding procedures are
in progress for other portions of the project. As a result of the
modifications in the project, the loan amount has been reduced to
US$12 million. The Government has consolidated all the water and
sewerage companies in the state into a single company, SABESP, and
a loan assumption agreement with the new company was concluded
December 18, 1974. Progress of the project is expected to improve
with new management which took office recently. The original
Closing Date was June 30, 1975.
786       Railway Project - MBR:   US$46 million loan of August 25, 1971;
Closing Date: September 30, 1975. Implementation of the project
is generally satisfactory but behind schedule. Derailments on the
central line and technical problems at the MBR loading and unload-
ing sites curtailed some traffic flows, but with improvements under
way in track-rehabilitation, bridge strengthening and siding

Loan Uo.
lengthening, traffic has reached the monthly target level by the
end of March 1975.   Except for the construction of the Jaccaba
worklshop, the project is expected to be completed by the Closing
Date.
737       MBR Iron Ore Project:   IJS$50 million loan of August 25, 1971;
Closing Date: December 31, 1976. The project was completed on
schedule, in November 1973, and has been operating satisfactorily
since.  The delay in completion of the railway project limited
output to about 80% of capacity in 1974. A 20% overrun in capital
costs resulted primarily from a change in scope of the project.
797       CSN Steel Expansion Project:    US$64.5 million loan of February 8,
1972; Closing Date: July 1, 1976. The latest cost estimate is
US$570 million, an increase of about 32% over the appraisal estimate
due to design evolution, unforeseen site works and increases in
local construction costs. The project is now 65% complete and is
about three months behind the appraisal schedule.
812       USIMINAS Steel Expansion Project:    US$63 million loan of April 11,
1972; Closing Date: June 1, 1976. The latest cost estimate is
US$800 million, an increase of about 40% from the appraisal estimate
due primarily to design evolution and increases in local construc-
tion costs. The project is 70% complete and is about six months
behind the original' schedule.
813       T'hird Highway Construction Project:   US$89 million loan of April 11,
1972; Closing Date: June 30, 1976. Construction works are more
than three-quarters completed, but are slightly behind schedule;
the estimated total contract cost is slightly above the appraisal
estimate. The feasibility studies and detailed engineering financed
under the loan were started later than planned, but are now completed
at a cost substantially below the appraisal estimate. Disbursements
are lagging behind the appraisal forecast, but have improved during
the past year and are now expected to be completed by the original
Closing Date of the loan.
828       COSIPA Steel Expansion Project:    US$64.5 million loan of June 14,
1972; Closing Date: January 15, 1977. The la'test cost estimate is
US$668 million, an increase of about 40% over the appraisal estimate
due primarily to increased local construction costs. This will not
significantly affect the economic justification of the project.
The project is now 60% complete and proceeding according to schedule
829       Sao Simao Hydroelectric Project:    US$60 million loan of June 14,
1972; Closing Date: September 30, 1979. The contract for the civil
works was awarded to an Italian-Brazilian consortium in Mav 1973,
and the project is proceeding according to schedule. An anticipated
9% cost overrun is being covered by local borrowing.

Loan No.
853       Alto Turi Land Settlement Project:    US$6.7 million loan of July 24,
1972; Closing Date: December 1, 1978. COLONE has prepared revised
fann development plans whose credit component, to be financed by
public financial institutions, will be significantly higher than
originally estimated, although still low in comparison to other
settlement projects. Administrative delays in the release of public
funds for farm credit and COLONE working capital requirements and
difficulties in recruiting project staff delayed the start of
project execution. Settlement, however, has now begun and the
project should be completed in 1978 as envisaged.
854       Fourth Highway Construction Project:    US$51 million loan of
August 4, 1972; Closing Date: December 31, 1976. Construction
works are more than half completed but behind schedule; the esti-
mated total contract cost is slightly above the appraisal estimate.
857       Grain Storage Project:   US$30 million loan of September 27, 1972;
Closing Date: December 31, 1979. After some initial difficulties
with the appraisal of subprojects, the project is now well underway.
The Bank and the Borrower have agreed on a revised indexing system
to ensure that sub-borrowers are charged a positive real interest
rate. The loan funds are expected to be fully committed by October
1975.
868       Interim Second Livest!ock Project:   US$26 million loan of December 19,
1972; Closing Date: June 30, 1977. The project is proceeding
normally. The loan has been fully committed and is expected to be
disbursed as scheduled.
887       Power Distribution Project:    US$20 million loan of April 16, 1973;
Closing Date: June 30, 1976. Principally due to difficulties
encountered in preparing bidding documents and delays in deliveries
of equipment and materials, the project is behind schedule. The
Borrower intends to accelerate procurement significantly this year
and disbursements are expected to be completed by the Closing Date.
923       Tttumbiara Hydroelectric Project:   US$125 million loan of August 1,
1973; Closing Date:   December 31, 1982.   Contracts for both the
concrete and earth works have been awarded. The project is
proceeding according to schedule.
