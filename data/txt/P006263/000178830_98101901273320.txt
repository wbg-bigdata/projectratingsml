BRAZIL
LOWER SA) FRANCISCO POLDERS PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        To meet a rapidly growing demand for energy in Northeast Brazil,
additional elements of the Paulo Afonso-Sobradinho hydroelectric power complex
on the Sao Francisco River will go into operation in early 1978 (Bank loan
1008-BR). This will cause significant changes in the flow regime of the river
below the complex, which in turn will drastically depress rice production in
the Lower Valley and endanger the livelihood of as many as 11,000 families,
unless corrective action is taken. These effects were recognized in the Paulo
Afonso appraisal and loan documents. An Emergency Plan to protect rice pro-
duction was conceived by Government as the most feasible alternative solution,
and the project would implement that plan. It also would include important
elements of agrarian reform to help insure that project benefits would be
shared equitably. In addition, the project would increase, as well as preserve,
agricultural production and assist Government in its national efforts to
alleviate poverty, increase gainful employment, and redistribute income.
Finally, the project would be in line with the goal of the Government to
improve life for the rural poor of Northeast Brazil.
ii.       Total project cost, including contingencies and interest during
construction, would be US$56.5 million. The proposed Bank loan of US$23
million would finance 40% of these costs and would cover foreign exchange
costs of US$15.3 million, interest on the Bank loan of US$3.9 million, and
local costs of US$3.8 milliof equivalent. Financing of local expenditures
to this extent would be justified, both by the magnitude of Brazil's total
external capital requirements, which greatly exceed its need for imported
capital goods, and by the desirability of consequential Bank participation
in a project of significant social importance.
iii.      This would be the first project in Brazil which contains irrigation
and agrarian reform components to be financed by the Bank Group. Through
1974, the Bank has made five loans totalling US$156.7 million to the agri-
cultural sector in Brazil: two for livestock development; two in support of
agro-industry and grain storage credit programs; and one for settlement.
All are proceeding satisfactorily.
iv.       The project, to be completed over a period of 4 years, would
include:
(a) protection of 32,000 ha of varzea (flood plain) land
and the provision of complete irrigation systems and
supporting infrastructure on 4,400 ha for increased
production;



- ii -
(b) freshwater fish production ponds and hatchery; and
(c) studies for a subsequent project.
v.        While the main project features are in themselves relatively simple,
the hydraulics of the river regime, the flooding of the varzeas, the agronomic
requirements, and the agrarian reform aspects combine to result in a complex
sequence of variables and operations. The varzeas presently are flooded
annually by the river and are used mainly for the cultivation of rice, which
is transplanted as the flood recedes. Sharecropping is the predominant
practice, with rice plots being about 1 to 1.5 ha in size. After completion
of the Paulo Afonso-Sobradinho facilities, the low flow in the river will
increase from 700 m3/sec to a minimum of 2,000 m3/sec, which would permanently
flood the lower areas in the varzeas where most of the rice is grown, unless
they are protected by dikes. Their functions basically would be to protect
against the daily fluctuations and the higher minimum flows and to permit
ponding within the varzeas to enable farmers to continue to grow rice as now.
As part of the proposed project, two varzeas would be scheduled for full
development (controlled irrigation), thus permitting double cropping of
rice. In a subsequent project phase, the remaining varzeas would be fully
developed.
vi.       With dikes, the land values immediately increase.  To prevent wind-
fall profits accruing to a few already relatively wealthy individuals who own
most of the land and to insure that the greatest possible number of share-
croppers and small- to medium-size owners farming the land receive the primary
benefits, the Government would acquire all lands under a decree issued on
March 17, 1975, which declared the project lands to be of public utility, and
would redistribute it in family-farm units in the two varzeas slated for full
development. Redistribution in the other varzeas would take place in a
subsequent project phase.
vii.      Companhia de Desenvolvimento do Vale do Sao Francisco (CODEVASF),
which is the successor organization to two predecessors which were active in
Sao Francisco River Valley development for 27 years, would be the executing
agency for the project. It is a Brazilian company, wholly-owned by the
Government, responsible to the Ministry of the Interior. It has been granted
special powers, such as that to expropriate land needed for public purposes.
With a core of experienced staff, and under new management, with greater
powers and flexibility to act, CODEVASF is considered capable of efficiently
planning, executing, and operating the project. CODEVASF would execute most
of the project by contracts and agreements with public and private agencies,
would provide personnel for the Agricultural Technical and Management Services,
and would operate and maintain the major protection, irrigation, and drainage
works.
viii.     By far the greatest portion of the work would be awarded on the
basis of international competitive bidding (ICB) procedures in accordance
with Bank Guidelines for Procurement. However, Brazil has a strong civil



- iii -
works contracting sector and it would be expected that practically all such
contracts would be with Brazilian contractors or consortia which include
such contractors. The pumping machinery, equipment, and vehicle purchases
would be grouped together, where feasible, and would be awarded on the basis
of ICB in accordance with Bank Guidelines when their aggregate contract value
would be equal to or greater than US$50,000 equivalent. Below US$50,000
equivalent, competitive bidding procedures with local advertising, which are
acceptable to the Bank, would be followed. The latter procedures also would
be followed for the award of contracts for minor civil works and buildings,
feeder roads, and social infrastructure, but total expenditures for such
works would not exceed US$3.6 million equivalent. For locally manufactured
items, the usual preference of 15% or the prevailing customs duties, if lower,
would be applied to the bid evaluation. Retroactive financing up to an expendi-
ture limit of US$3 million would be accepted, due to the urgent need for design
and construction to proceed.
ix.       The average family income of farmers expected to participate in the
project would be about US$1,500 per year after full development, about 9
years after start of the project. This would represent a dramatic improvement
over present levels of income (US$200/year). This improvement in standard of
living would be only partially due to the productive aspects of the project.
An important share of incremental disposal income results from the effects
of the redistributive (land reform) elements of the project. The best
estimates of incremental financial rates of return vary in the fully developed
varzeas from 24% to 31%, depending upon the combination of irrigated and rain-
fed land in each farm.
X.        In view of the fact that the "emergency" portion of the project
would be justified solely to offset damages resulting from the Paulo Afonso-
Sobradinho hydroelectric facilities and to retain the "status quo" of the
varzea farmers, no rate of return calculation was made for the varzeas which
would receive dikes and pumping stations only. For the two varzeas which
would be brought to full development, the economic rate of return on the
investment for internal irrigation and drainage systems would be about 16%.
xi.       The project would generate about 9,000 man-years of employment
during construction. In addition, some 18,000 permanent jobs would be pro-
tected and about 4,800 jobs would increase from 60 man-days per year to full
employment on farms.
xii.      The project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$23 million for a term
of 25 years, with a grace period of 5 years. The borrower would be- the Federa-
tive Republic of Brazil.






BRAZIL
LOWER SAO FRANCISCO POLDERS PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of the Federative Republic of Brazil has requested
a loan to help finance an agriculture protection and development project in
the lower valley of the Sao Francisco River. The project has been designated
as one of "Emergency" priority by Government because of the need to move
quickly to protect about 32,000 ha of varzea (flood plain) lands and the
livelihood of as many as 11,000 farm families against changed river levels
resulting from operation of new elements of the upstream Paulo Afonso-Sobradinho
hydroelectric power complex in early 1978 (Bank loan 1008-BR).
1.02      This would be the Bank's first project in Brazil to contain irri-
gation and agrarian reform components. Through 1974, the Bank made five
loans totalling US$156.7 million to the agricultural sector in Brazil: two
loans for a total of US$66 million for livestock development; two amounting
to US$84 million in support of agro-industry and grain storage credit programs;
and one for US$6.7 million for settlement. All are proceeding satisfactorily.
II. BACKGROUND
General
2.01      Despite Brazil's recent economic growth of over 10% per year between
1967 and 1974, and its vast potential, it remains a country with a modest GNP
per capita --about US$610 (for 1972)-- and a very unequal distribution of
income. In 1970, the 5% of the population at the upper end of the income
scale received 34% of the national income, and the lowest 40% received only
10%. There are also great income disparities between the urban and the rural
sectors: estimates for 1970 indicate that no more than 20% of the rural
population had income above the minimum wage (then about US$25/month, depend-
ing upon the State), while approximately 60% to 70% of the urban population
did. Government is pursuing various programs to alleviate poverty, facilitate
access to more gainful employment, and redistribute income. The proposed
Lower Sao Francisco project would be a part of these efforts.
Northeast Brazil
2.02      Northeast Brazil, in which the project area is located, contains
one of the largest concentrations of poverty in Latin America. Key economic
and social indicators for Brazil and Northeast Brazil are given in Table 2,
Annex 1. With almost 60% of the population living in rural areas and agri-
culture providing over 60% of employment and 33% of the regional NDP, the
importance of agriculture to the Northeast economy is readily recognized.
However, agricultural yields in the region are generally low, as the effects
of poor ecological conditions --semi-arid weather and scarcity of fertile



- 2 -
lands-- are compounded by problems stemming from concentration of land ownership
and associated sharecropping and rental arrangements. Also, insufficient
technical assistance, poorly developed marketing channels, primitive production
techniques, inadequate research, lack of good access to institutional credit,
insufficient economic and social infrastructure, and weak public institutions
have contributed to the limitations of agricultural production, despite
considerable efforts toward improvement.
2.03      Farms in the Northeast with less than 10 ha represent almost 70% of
the total number of farms but control less than 6% of the total area. Distri-
bution of wealth incorporated into land (taking into account soil fertility
and fixed capital) is at least as unevenly distributed. Perhaps even more
serious than the plight of the small landowners is the plight of the 80% of
the rural labor force that does not own land.
2.04      In order to meet a rapidly growing demand for energy in Northeast
Brazil, Companhia Hidro Eletrica do Sao Francisco (CHESF) has accelerated its
program of installation of hydroelectric power facilities on the Sao Francisco
River, which has an annual runoff greater than that of the Nile. These facili-
ties are being financed in part by a US$81 million Bank loan (1008-BR). When
the first groups of these new units commence operations in early 1978, changes
in the flow regime will have an especially adverse effect on the fertile var-
zeas of the Lower Sao Francisco region, where about 11,000 families earn their
livelihood, primarily by rice farming. The majority of the rice plots are
farmed by sharecroppers and small landowners, with the average size of rice
plot farmed per family being about 1.2 ha. Unless dikes and pumping stations
are completed before the turbitie peaking and changed flow regime begin, rice
production and the area economy will be drastically depressed.
2.05      The potential effects of the Sobradinho - Paulo Afonso complex on
the lower valley were recognized specifically in the loan agreement for the
Paulo Afonso Project. The Government agreed to submit to the Bank, within
nine months of the loan date, "the engineering study and cost estimates for
the Lower Sao Francisco emergency project," and to "put such emergency pro-
ject into effect by December 31, 1978, or such other date as shall be agreed
with the Bank." Further, the Government agreed to prepare, within 15 months
of the loan date," a comprehensive development program to cause the benefits
of the Lower Sao Francisco emergency project----to be shared equitably by
landholders, sharecroppers and laborers in the area of such project:-"
However, no funds for such work were provided in the loan.
III. THE PROJECT AREA
Location, Climate, and Soils
3.01     .Location.  The Lower Sao Francisco Valley covers an area of some
13,000 km  of the river basin downstream of the Paulo Alfonso rapids to the
sea, a distance of approximately 200 km (Map No. 11560). Below the rapids
the river flows in a deep gorge until it reaches the town of Pao de Acucar



-3-
where the valley begins to broaden into numerous flood plains, or varzeas. Some
76 cultivable varzeas have been identified, of which only 8 are considered
"large," ranging in size from 1,200 ha to 8,600 ha (Map No. 11565), and having
a combined gross arable area of about 36,000 ha. Some 68 smaller varzeas are
located mainly upstream from Propria and range in size from 5 ha to 300 ha.
Annex 1 provides additional details.
3.02      Climate.  The climate of the area is semi-tropical humid with annual
rainfall averaging 1,200 mm near the coast and decreasing gradually to about
600 mm at Pao de Acucar. About 75% of the rainfall occurs during the March
through August period, although no month is without rain. Mean annual temp-
erature is around  25C, varying from 22C in August to 27°C in January-March.
3.03      Soils.  There are three principal soil types in the project area:
(i) flat, heavy clay soils in the lower parts of the varzeas; (ii) lighter,
gently undulating soils of the levees and terraces (combros); and (iii) well-
drained latosols on the highlands outside the varzeas (tabuleiros).
River Regime
3.04      The dominant physical feature of the area is the Sao Francisco
River, which has an annual average discharge of almost 100 billion cubic
meters.  The minimum floy is about 700 m3/sec and the maximum monthly dis-
charge is about 11,100 m /sec. Upstream regulation for power projects will
increase the minimum flow to about 2,000 m3/sec in 1978. Ample water, of good
quality for irrigation, will continue to be available in the lower valley,
with irrigable land being the limiting factor. The river normally has only
one large flood crest in the lower valley, peaking during the January-March
period, and then slowly receding to minimum levels in August-September. Oc-
casionally a second, smaller, peak occurs after the main flood, causing farmers
to lose their planted rice crop and forcing them to replant. The floods are
governed by the rainy season in the interior river basin, which precedes by
several months the lower valley rainy season. The unusual combination of
early floods and late rains in the project area makes possible the present
cultivation of rice on the varzeas.
Population and Socio-Economic Conditions
3.05      Total population of the lower valley in 1970 was about 540,000, of
which 213,000 were in the 18 riparian municipalities. Some 123,000 of those
were classified as rural and 47,000 as active agricultural population. An
average family consists of about 5 persons. Population increased by 2.6% per
year in the 1960-70 period but available information shows a significant
emigration of men (see Annex 1, Table 3). Overpopulation and the almost
complete absence of alternative sources of work in the area result in high
unemployment (about 50%) and very high underemployment. Levels of income in
the Lower Sao Francisco region in 1968 and 1969 were around US$80 per capita
per year, being only about 50% and 72% of the average incomes in the states
of Sergipe and Alagoas as a whole, and 65% of that for the northeast of Brazil.
The average income of the rural population was only 50% of that of the urban.
Illiteracy is widespread in the rural areas; in 1970 81.4% of the rural popu-
lation over five years of age was illiterate, while the proportion of rural



-4-
children over five years of age attending school (about 11% of the rural
population) was considerably lower than in rural areas in the states of
Alagoas and Sergipe as a whole.
Agricultural Credit
3.06      Agricultural credit in the project area has been growing at an
extremely rapid rate because of the influx of funds of the Government's
PROTERRA program. 1/ Credit under this program is lent at subsidized rates
of interest and without monetary correction, which is justified since
recipients are in the lower income groups, and since the credit is accompanied
by technical assistance which prevents misallocation of resources (Annex 2,
Table 2). Up to now, there has not been a credit shortage and future demand
is not expected to grow substantially as a result of project implementation,
since most rice production is already done with credit on-lent to the share-
croppers through the landowners. However, the terms should be extended, as
the main incremental credit demand would come from double cropping of rice
and therefore it would be relatively constant over the year, requiring
revision of the present 9-month production terms.
Processing and Marketing
3.07      Rice mills are old and technologically inadequate, producing ex-
cessive broken grain and small throughput (3 tons per day on average). In
addition, they lack facilities for storage and the millers do not have the
capital to stockpile for the nonproducing months. This leads to an irrational
pattern of marketing by which, immediately after harvest, 40% of the white
rice is exported to the cities of Recife, Maceio, Garanhuns and Aracaju.
These forced seasonal exports of rice create, in turn, seasonal imports into
the area from Rio Grande do Sul and Maranhao (3,000 km away). Government is,
at present, considering the possibility of installing in the area two new rice
mills, with enough storage capacity to avoid this pattern of seasonal exports
(Annex 2, paras 11 and 12). Assurances were obtained during negotiations
that any need for additional rice-milling and storage capacity would be met.
Other incremental production over and above present projected area production
would not encounter significant marketing or processing problems.
Agricultural Extension and Research
3.08      Agricultural extension is at present provided by Associacao Nordestina
de Credito e Assistencia Rural (ANCAR) and devoted mainly to the implementation
of two programs: PROVALE, 2/ which is directed specifically to encouraging the
use of irrigation, and SIERVALE, 2/ which provides extension services to crop
and livestock producers. These programs, started in 1972, are due to continue
1/   PROTERRA;  Program for the Redistribution of Land and Stimulation of
Agro-Business in the North and Northeast.

until 1977, and they have been mainly directed to medium and large-size far-
mers. A professional staff of 19 works on these programs in the project area.
No significant effort, with the exception of two cooperatives in the area, is
directed toward small farmers.
3.09      A modest program of field experimentation undertaken by SWVALE
has been in progress in the project area since 1968. Main emphasis has been
on rice testing and maintaining the purity of new varieties, experimenting
in plant density and fertilizer requirements, and, to a lesser degree, methods
of pest and weed control. As a sideline, the Director of the research program
supervises an 18-ha rice seed farm at Propria, since no state-wide organiza-
tion exists for the provision of good quality seed.
The Agrarian Structure
3.10      The agro-economic system of the area and the resulting land tenure
structure have been, and are, shaped by rice cultivation. In total 20,000 ha
are cultivated each year in the project area. Rice and pastures are the
dominant crops and account for some 35% to 40% each. The remaining 20% is
comprised mainly of other annual crops (10%) and permanent crops (7%). A
representative sample of crops in a large part of the project area is presented
in Annex 3. Table 1. The varzeas have most of the rice cultivation and are
therefore the lands with the highest agricultural potential. Population
density is extremely high, resulting in pressure for land ownership and land
use (Annex 1, Table 3). Nevertheless, land ownership is extremely concen-
trated in the project area (see Annex 3, Table 2), with some 7% of farms
occupying 80% of the land. Because of this, less than 100 farmers practically
control 90% of the land area.
3.11      On the varzeas, sharecroppers normally cultivate about 1 to 1.5 ha
of rice land and have the right to plant about 1 ha of combro or highlands
with subsistence crops.  Land preparation, provision of the transplants, and
water control (if any) are the responsibility of the proprietor, while trans-
planting, harvesting and threshing are undertaken by the sharecropper and his
family in return for which they receive a nominal 50% of the crop. The pro-
prietor gives advances for family subsistence during the crop season, has the
right to fix the price of rice at repayment time (harvest), and demands pay-
ment in kind. As a result of these and other practices mandated by the
landlord, sharecropping is actually more of a 2/3:1/3 (landlord:sharecropper)
arrangement than the nominal 50-50. Therefore, although the gross income of
a sharecropping family from 1 ha of rice and 1 ha of subsistence crops is
in the order of US$200 per year, its net disposable income amounts to only
US$100 per year. It is clear then that the 8,000 sharecroppers and their
families are among the poorest of the rural poor of the Northeast of Brazil,
where the average rural income is US$200 per year per capita.

IV. THE PROJECT
A. Brief Description
4.01      The main components of the project would be as shown in the table
overleaf. The proposed project would maintain present rice production in six
large varzeas and for perhaps as many as 15 to 20 small varzeas by providing
flood protection dikes and dual-purpose irrigation-drainage pumps. Two large
varzeas, Marituba and Betume, would also be provided with complete internal
irrigation distribution and drainage systems thus enabling improved production
practices to be introduced, including double-cropping of rice. Overall, the
project would result in the following:
Area    Population
(ha)    (approx.)
Total rice area protected in six large varzeas  =         11,100      31,000
Total rice area protected in small varzeas        =        2,400       5,000
Total rice area protected                         =       13,500      36,000
Gross area protected                              =       32,000      47,000
Rice land provided with full irrigation
and drainage systems                            -        4,440       9,300
Other arable land provided with full
irrigation and drainage systems                 =          750       1,500
CODEVASF would be the executing agency for the project.
4.02      To prevent-windfall profits accruing to a few already wealthy
individuals and to insure that the greatest possible number of sharecroppers
and small and medium-size owners farming the land receive the primary bene-
fits, agrarian reform and land redistribution would be carried out as
important elements of the project. Government has issued a decree (March 17,
1975) declaring all lands included in the project subject to expropriation.
The Government would acquire the farmlands and redivide and lease, or allocate,
them to qualified farmers, possibly utilizing, in some cases, some form of
cooperative ownership. Existing sources of production credit are expected
to be adequate so no project funds would be allowed for such use. Neverthe-
less, an assurance was obtained at negotiations that Government would ensure
that funds for credit would be made available if needed.
B. Project Components
Emergency Dikes and Pumping Stations
4.03      Dikes and pumping stations would be built on the four varzeas of
Boacica, Cotinguiba, Pindoba and Brejo Grande. However, these lands would
not be redistributed during this phase of the project (para 4.15). They
would continue to be flooded annually, by gravity, through sluice gates when

flood levels permit and by pumping during years of low flow, thus, maintaining
the present extensive flooding system. Annex 4 provides additional details.
Small varzeas would be similarly protected and operated, but less than half
may have sufficient land to justify protection. Feasibility studies for
individual or groups of small varzeas would be submitted to the Bank for
review prior to commencement of any construction work in such varzeas. During
negotiations, assurances to this effect were obtained.
Full Development of Marituba and Betume
4.04      About 1,800 ha in the Marituba varzea on the left bank of the river
(Alagoas) and 3,400 ha in the Betume varzea, opposite Marituba on the right
bank (Sergipe), would be provided with protective dikes, pumping stations,
and internal irrigation and drainage systems. The other four large varzeas
would be fully developed during a second project phase. The task of construc-
ting emergency dikes and pumping stations for all varzeas, plus developing
the varzeas of Marituba and Betume, would fully occupy the technical and
managerial resources available during the four-year project implementation
period. Land redistribution would be an especially challenging undertaking.
With the average rice farm size per family changing from 1.2 ha to 2.5 ha,
approximately one-half of those now using such land would have to move to
areas where unused land is available, or find other employment. The Marituba
varzea is the only one with some unused land, and hence was a logical choice
for full development priority. Detailed engineering designs already exist
for half of the Betume varzea; hence, it was a logical second choice. In
total, some 1,900 settlers would be established in the first two varzeas.
As available land in the varzeas would not permit resettlement of all present
population, a major component of a second-phase project would be resettlement
of excess population on neighboring tabuleiro land. Land redistribution
would be carried out in Marituba and Betume in this project. Some 85% of the
irrigated land would be in rice, while 3,600 ha at Marituba would be under
improved rainfed agriculture. Irrigated farms would have about 2.5 ha of
rice land, plus 0.5 ha of combro land, and rainfed farms would have from 10
to 12 ha of combro lands. Irrigation would be by gravity through unlined
canals, but a small area of sprinkler irrigation would be provided in the
lfarituba varzea to establish the feasibility of the method on the undulating
combro lands. It would not be possible to know how many families must be
resettled until completion of detailed cadastral surveys, and of the screening
and selection of farmers eligible for settlement. The basic plan during this
first phase of the project would be to develop and redistribute the Betume
lands to the maximum extent possible without exceeding the capacity of the
MSarituba varzea to absorb excess farmers from Betume. It is estimated that
approximately 400 families would move across the river from Betume to
Mtarituba. However, all plans for land redistribution would be developed in
consultation with the Bank, mainly to determine farm sizes and qualifications
of settlers. Assurances to this effect were obtained from Government during
negotiations.
Provisions for Excess Farmers
4.05      It is possible that some families (perhaps 200) presently farming
in the varzeas to be fully developed would wish to continue to farm but would



-9-
not meet eligibility requirements for project land (age, health, credit-worthi-
ness, and such), or for whom farm land in the project area would not be available
because of limitations on area. The preparation by the Government of.plans,
acceptable to the Bank, to enable people (farmers, laborers, or sharecroppers)
displaced by any project activity to continue to earn a reasonable livelihood
would be a condition precedent to disbursement of any funds for physical
construction related to that activity. During negotiations, assurances were
obtained to this effect.
4.06      Long-range plans recognize that the varzeas cannot absorb all those
wanting to continue to farm. Therefore, since large areas of the nearby
tabuleiros and transition slopes are under-utilized, the project would evaluate
the potential of these types of lands as future locations of viable family
farm units by providing management and technical assistance to, and conducting
field trials in, an already existing (but poorly performing) cooperative area
covering about 1,000 ha of tabuleiros lands a short distance from Penedo (Annex
5, para 7).
4.07      There also will be some farmers in some of the small varzeas and
on islands in the main river who will be adversely affected by the Paulo
Afonso-Sobradinho project, but for whom the cost of providing protective
dikes or alternative water supplies would be uneconomic. No count has been
made of the number of farmers in this category, but perhaps as many as 1,000
could be included. During negotiations, assurances were obtained that the
Government would present plans by December 31, 1976, acceptable to the Bank,
for resettling or compensating those who are significantly adversely affected
and who are not otherwise resettled or included in the first phase (Emergency)
project.
Technical and Management Services
4.08      In order to cope with the new agricultural structure introduced by
the land reform program, a major shift in the services provided to the com-
munity is envisaged. Reorganization of extension services would focus on the
need to assist small rice farmers, especially in organizational and marketing
aspects, as well as to advise and monitor progress in the technical aspects
of rice and other crop production. Similar services would be provided for
tabuleiros rainfed agriculture. Additional details and estimated costs are
given in Annex 5.
4.09      Cooperatives.  Membership in cooperatives would be obligatory for
project beneficiaries in the fully developed varzeas in order to facilitate
the provision of credit and technical services. In the initial stages, the
cooperatives would receive close guidance and supervision by staff appointed
by CODEVASF. As cooperative members are progressively trained to accept more
responsibility, assistance from CODEVASF would be reduced (Annex 5). During
negotiations, assurances were obtained that the Government would arrange for
adequate initial capital for each cooperative established in the area of this
project.

Agricultural Research
4.10      The project would expand the program of field experimentation des-
cribed in paragraph 3.09. In view of the rather specific needs of the area,
the program would be exclusively applied research and would be financed and
controlled by CODEVASF. However, close liaison would continue to be main-
tained with the Brazilian Agricultural Research Enterprise (EMBRAPA).
Fish Production and Research
4.11      Fish and shellfish in the sloughs of the varzeas are important
protein sources in the diets of varzea residents and a source of food and
income for many fishermen. The elimination of flooding in the fully developed
varzeas would decrease annual freshwater fish production by about 300 tons,
out of an estimated present production of 1,150 tons. To offset this at
least partially the project would include: fry (small fish) collection
centers; a hatchery; about 50 ha of demonstration ponds 1 to 2 ha in size;
production ponds, which would include 150 ha of artificial ponds 1 ha to 10
ha in area; 60 ha of natural ponds of varying sizes; and 60 ha of 0.5-ha
ponds on small farms, which would utilize the drainage water from rice
fields. The first step in the program would be a study beginning in late
summer 1975 and lasting probably about nine months. Production would begin
in the second project year and would yield about 200 tons annually (Annex 6).
CODEVASF would operate all facilities except the production ponds.
Feeder Roads and Social Infrastructure
4.12      The project would include the upgrading of about 60 km of existing
feeder roads and the construction of 34 km of new ones, both with all-weather
gravel surfaces of 5.5 m width. The Government would submit feasibility
studies to the Bank justifying the selection of specific roads prior to com-
mencement of construction of each road. During negotiations, assurances to
this effect were obtained (Annex 7).
4.13      Priority for installation of a limited number of social infrastructure
components would be given to villages in the Marituba and Betume varzeas.
This project would provide for about eight village water systems capable of
serving about 4,000 persons; building approximately 13 new elementary school
classrooms, upgrading some existing schools, and setting up several vocational-
training workshops, all of which would benefit about 2,500 pupils and trainees
on a two-shift basis, or approximately 3,200 families; and rural electricity
distribution systems serving about 5,000 persons. In addition the project
includes a health post in Marituba, a dispensary in Betume, a small improved
household privy program, and assistance to existing programs to control
endemic diseases such as maleria and schistosomiasis. Facilities would be
built only in locations in which the needed professionals, other personnel,
and operating funds are assured. For other than new villages created for
project settlers, electricity and water facilities would not be installed
unless the residents agreed to contribute at least 20% of the capital costs,



- 11 -
in cash and/or kind, and to pay all O&M costs or prevailing tariffs for these
services. Any new villages which would be required to provide homes for
project settlers would have these installed without capital contributions
required from the settlers, but the residents would pay all O&M costs or
prevailing tariffs. A further limitation on water supply and electricity
systems would be that initial investment costs per capita could not exceed
US$50 and US$60, respectively. During negotiations, assurances were obtained
that all of the provisions of this paragraph would be implemented.
Studies, Surveys, and Plans
4.14      The project would finance preparation of a detailed Master Plan and
Feasibility Study, which could be the basis for an integrated rural development
project for the Lower Valley region (Annex 8) and a logical expansion of this
project. It would also complete the surveys and designs for full development
of four large varzeas and for emergency works on the small varzeas. Addi-
tionally, it would execute the studies and design for the Fisheries Program
(Annex 8) and complete the cadastral surveys for the land acquisition and
redistribution aspects of the present project. A system would be established
to monitor project progress and costs and to gather data to evaluate the
soundness of the technical, financial, and economic assumptions used in the
project appraisal. Monitoring would be performed with the help of an entity
other than CODEVASF. Assurances in these respects were obtained during nego-
tiations. Annex 9 provides additional information. Provision of all these
services would require about 850 man-months of consulting services. Another
500 man-months of consulting services would be required for engineering design
and construction supervision,of the first-phase project works.
Land
4.15      Project lands presently are privately owned and would be acquired
by the Government by cash purchase. This would be a major cost and has been
included as a project component. However, the Bank would not disburse against
land purchase costs. All varzea lands which would be included in the project
would be declared by Government decree to be subject to expropriation (para
4.02). This action would have the effect of "freezing" land values at present
prices, although CODEVASF, acting for the Government, would have up to five
years to take possession. The plan would be for CODEVASF to purchase and take
legal, although not necessarily physical, possession as rapidly as possible
of all lands required for right-of-way and of all lands in the two varzeas
slated for full development (Marituba and Betume). The present owners or
farmers could continue to use, or others could use (by rental), the lands
until they were needed for construction or redistribution. In the large and
small varzeas, where only protective works would be constructed under this
project, CODEVASF would purchase the lands within the time limits of the
expropriation laws and would lease them to be farmed until redistribution
took place under a subsequent phase of the project, since lands for resettle-
ment of excess farmers from these areas would not be a-iailable under this
phase. Redistribution could entail leasing, cooperative ownership, or sale.
All plans for land redistribution would be developed in consultation with
the Bank (para 4.04).

- 13 -
4.17      Costs have been estimated at April 1975 prices, and physical con-
tingencies of from 15% to 20% have been added for all components except for
Additional Studies and Monitoring, where only 10% was used. Price contin-
gencies used were as follows: 1975 (7 mo.), 9% for equipment and 12% for
civil works; 1976, 10% and 14%, respectively; 1977 and 1978, 8% and 12%,
respectively.
D. Financing, Procurement, and Disbursement
Financing
4.18      The proposed Bank loan of US$23 million would finance 40% of total
project costs, including a proportionate share of physical and price contin-
gencies and interest on the Bank loat during construction (US$3.9 million).
Total foreign exchange costs of the project, excluding Bank loan interest,
and assuming that most major construction contracts would be won by Brazilian
contractors, would be US$15.3 million. The loan would include financing of
local expenditures of about US$3.8 million equivalent, which would be justi-
fied both by the magnitude of Brazil's total external capital requirements,
which greatly exceed its need for imported capital goods, and by the desir-
ability of consequential Bank participation in a project of significant
social importance. The balance of project financing would be provided from
Government budget allocations to CODEVASF and to other Government entities.
The borrower would cause CHESF to compensate CODEVASF for the capital cost
of emergency dikes and pumping stations in the project area, the cost of
operating and maintaining such dikes and pumping stations, and the cost of
resettling farmers, sharecroppers, and farm laborers of the area whose
present livelihoods will not be protected from changes in the regime of the
Sao Francisco River brought about by the construction upstream of hydro-
electric installations by CHESF, or otherwise provide for these costs.
Assurances in this regard were obtained during negotiations. Some minor
contributions-by villages to capital costs of rural and water and electricity
systems would be realized (para 4.13). The loan would be for 25 years, with
five years of grace, at the current Bank interest rate. The Federative
Republic of Brazil, would be the borrower and would assume the foreign
exchange risk. The closing date of the loan would be December 31, 1979.
Procurement
4.19      Contracts for the construction of the emergency dikes, pumping
stations, and the full development of the Marituba and Betume varzeas, and
contracts for the procurement of equipment and vehicles would be awarded
following international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's
Guidelines for procurement. Brazil has a strong civil works contracting
industry, and it would be expected that most civil works contracts would
be won by Brazilian contractors or consortia which would include such contrac-
tors. The need to complete the main work before 1978 would preclude widespread
use of labor-intensive methods, although such methods could prove feasible for



- 14 -
some minor civil works. To encourage greater competition, contracts for vehi-
cles and equipment would be grouped where possible. Local manufacturers would
be accorded a preference of 15% or the customs duties, whichever is lower, in
bid evaluation. Contracts below $50,000 equivalent and minor civil works (i.e.
fisheries facilities) and buildings, feeder roads and social infrastructure
components would be awarded on the basis of competitive bidding advertised
locally and in accordance with local procedures, which are satisfactory to the
Bank. Total expenditures under local procurement procedures would not be ex-
pected to exceed US$3.6 million. During negotiations, assurances were obtained
that these procedures would be followed. CODEVASF would be encouraged to
follow Bank Guidelines for the procurement of consulting services.
Disbursement
4.20      Disbursements for vehicles, maintenance equipment for civil works,
and for pumping station mechanical and electrical equipment would be made at
the rate of 100% against the cif cost of directly imported equipment and
against the ex-factory cost of locally manufactured equipment. For off-the-
shelf imported items, disbursements would be made for the cif cost if it can be
determined; otherwise, disbursements would be made 75% of total cost.
For other expenditures, such as for civil works, consultant and other services,
and small equipment, disbursements would be at the rate of 40% or 50% of total
expenditures as indicated in Annex 11, Table 1. Interest and other charges
on the Bank loan during construction would be disbursed against amounts due
up through June 30, 1979. Disbursements would be made for retroactive financ-
ing up to a maximum of US$3 million from March 17, 1975 for design and con-
struction work under Categories 1, 2 and 6. Loan disbursements would be expected
to extend until December 31, 1979. Any undisbursed funds remaining after
project completion would be cancelled unless their use on other project needs
could be justified. The Schedule of Disbursement is given in Annex 11, Table
2.
E. Organization and Management
CODEVASF
4.21      CODEVASF would be executing agency for the project.  CODEVASF is
wholly owned by the Government and operates under the Minister of the Interior.
As a company, rather than a Government agency, it has more freedom in certain
areas, as in establishing salaries, borrowing money, and participating finan-
cially in agro-industrial enterprises. It also has been granted special
powers, so that upon issuance of a Government decree it can assist in the
expropriation of land needed for public purposes. With a core of experienced
staff and under new management, with greater powers and flexibility to act,
CODEVASF is considered capable of efficiently planning, executing and oper-
ating the project. Annex 12 provides more information on CODEVASF.
Project Organization
4.22      Normally, CODEVASF executes its projects by contracts and agreements
with public or private intermediary agencies. Consequently, for the proposed



- 15 -
project, it would negotiate contracts with several agencies, such as EMBRAPA
for research, ANCAR for extension work, and state and municipal highway depart-
ments for feeder road construction. However, in addition to its overall
coordination role, CODEVASF would directly manage the important land acquisi-
tion and redistribution aspects; provide most personnel for the Agricultural
Technical and Management Services; and operate and maintain the major pro-
tection, irrigation, and drainage works. A Project Director has already been
appointed.
Operation and Maintenance of Project Facilities
4.23      The dikes, pumping stations, irrigation and drainage systems, and
the internal varzea farm and maintenance roads would be operated and main-
tained by CODEVASF. An initial maintenance equipment allowance would be
included in the project. In the two varzeas which would have internal irri-
gation and drainage systems, all O&M costs properly allocable to the bene-
ficiaries would be included in the annual charges to the water users (see
paras 4.27 and 4.28). O&M costs for the dikes and the main pumping stations,
which are attributable almost in their entirety to the Paulo Afonso-Sobradinho
Project, would not be charged to the farmers, but would be borne by Government.
CODEVASF and CHESF, at the suggestion of their respective supervisory Ministers
(Interior, and Mines and Energy, respectively), are exploring means by which
CHESF, the immediate beneficiary of the Paulo Afonso-Sobradinho Project, could
assume the obligation for a major portion of the project costs, which in turn
would be paid by the users of CHESF power.
4.24      The responsibility 'for operating and maintaining feeder roads,
schools, health facilities, and village water systems would fall to state
and municipal authorities. Village electrical systems would be the respon-
sibility of the local electric companies. CODEVASF would obtain assurances
from these entities that they were able to meet these obligations prior to
constructing any of these social infrastructure facilities, or would assume
the obligation itself. CODEVASF would provide technical and organizational
assistance to villages where social infrastructure would be developed in the
absence of such assistance from local entities, or as a supplement thereto.
Assurances in these respects were obtained during negotiations.
F. Advance Contracting
4.25      Because of the emergency nature of the project, the Government is
proceeding with the detailed designs and engineering for the dikes and pumping
stations and to advertise for construction bids. Dike construction work
already has been started under a negotiated contract at the Boacica varzea.
Costs of the consultants engaged and construction contracts, however, would
not be eligible for Bank disbursement. CODEVASF intends to enter into future
contracts following Bank Guidelines and the procedures set forth in paragraph
4.19, and some may be awarded before loan signing. All design and construc-
tion work awarded following procedures acceptable to the Bank, up to a maximum



- 16 -
expenditure limit of US$3 million, would be considered eligible for retro-
active financing, provided, that such advance contracting would have taken
place subsequent to the date of the Government decree declaring all project
lands to be subject to expropriation for project purposes (March 17, 1975).
G. Accounting and Auditing
4.26      Government and CODEVASF have agreed that CODEVASF would have its
accounts, including a separate account for the project, and financial state-
ments for each fiscal year, audited in accordance with sound auditing prin-
ciples by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank. Further, it was agreed
that certified copies of CODEVASF's financial statements and the report of
such audit would be furnished to the Bank not later than four months after
the end of such year. During negotiations, assurances in those matters were
obtained.  A condition of loan effectiveness would be the establishment in
CODEVASF of a separate project account, acceptable to the Bank.
H. Irrigation Water and Development Charges
4.27      While Brazil has only this year adopted an overall Government policy
for irrigation water charges, both CODEVASF and the Ministry of the Interior's
Departamento Nacional de Obras Contra as Secas (DNOCS) have had experience
in assessing and collecting irrigation water charges. CODEVASF now operates
three small projects and has established water charges based on a fee per
cubic meter of estimated water use. The equivalent charge has varied from
US$25/ha to US$80/ha. Under the new national guidelines, water charges will
be the sum of two fees: the first based on the area served, the capital
invested to provide water service to that area, and the ability of the farmer
to pay (i.e., individuals with farms larger than 15 ha or companies with
more than 50 ha would pay substantially more than farmers with less than
15 ha); and the second based on annual O&M costs and the quantity of water
used. The Government has not yet made a final decision on the redistribution
of land. For this reason a significant land rent (US$62/ha/year) has been
included in the project costs charged to the beneficiaries of the full irri-
gation development. If it is decided later to sell the land to them, this
amount would enable them to pay the purchase price without undue strain on
their cash flows.
4.28      In addition to land rent, farmers would pay water charges to recover
the difference between the costs for the full irrigation development and the
costs of an emergency protection system only. These costs would be about
US$1,578/ha for investment and US$21/ha/year for O&M. Annual charges of
US$49/ha for capital recovery and US$21/ba for O&M would permit full recovery
of the irrigation developmental component costs over a period of about 35 years
at 0% interest, with a three-year grace period. At a discount rate of 10%,



- 17 -
the present worth of such charges over a 50-year project life, with an initial
three-year grace period, would be US$572/ha. The present worth of the develop-
ment costs plus O&M costs over the same period at 10% would be US$1,786/ha,
indicating a recovery ratio of about 32%. Annual developmental charges then
would average US$21/ha for OEM, US$49/ha for capital recovery, and US$62/ha
for land rent, or a total charge of US$132/ha/year for irrigated land. These
charges would represent an average of 24% of gross farm benefits (para 5.06).
A few larger farms would be able to pay proportionately more. Charges each
year would be established on the basis of what the area farmers could reason-
ably afford to pay for water in addition to land rent or purchase, out of
otherwise net disposable income. Water charges would be established in
consultation with the Bank.  During negotiations, assurances to this effect
were obtained.
I.  Environmental Aspects
4.29      A unique feature of this project would be that one of its primary
purposes would be to offset the adverse effect of another project -- the
upstream Paulo Afonso hydroelectric power project. In addition, it would,
by reducing extensive flooding in'the two varzeas slated for full development,
improve the general environment in those areas. The negative effect of this
project on the fisheries in those two varzeas would be offset by the fisheries
program (para 4.11).  The detailed study included in the fisheries program
would also provide further insight into the preservation and enhancement of
the fisheries resources of the entire lower 200 km of the Sao Francisco River.
Further, CODEVASF would advise farmers through its Agricultural Extension
activities on the selection of pesticides that would not be harmful to fish
resources, other crops, or health, and would help initiate control programs
to monitor applications of agricultural chemicals.
V. PRODUCTION, MARKETING, AND PRODUCER BENEFITS
Production
5.01       Rice would account for some 60% of total project production.  Other
products would be beef and milk, manioc, beans, tomatoes, onions, peanuts,
coconuts, and some cotton (see Annex 13). Farmers would be expected to shift
to the most profitable of these secondary crops as farming conditions change.
However, significant increases in production would be expected only in rice,
(from 13,000, to 28,000 tons of white rice) as most of the other crops would
cover only a very small area.
Marketing
5.02      Most of the peanuts, beans,'maize, coconuts, beef and rice would
be consumed locally either in the local towns and villages or for subsistence.



- 18 -
Some cotton, tomatoes and milk would likely be exported to the larger regional
cities of Aracaju, Arapiraca and Maceio (Annex 2). In summary, due to the
relatively small incremental production and to the large existing deficiencies
in rice production in the area, no serious marketing problems are foreseen.
Producer Benefits
5.03      The benefits of the project may be categorized into four main
groups:
(a) Those that would derive from the implementation of the
emergency works which would prevent flooding caused by
construction of the upstream hydroelectric power works.
Costs of the emergency works are therefore considered to
be costs of the hydroelectric power generated, and as such,
they have not been charged to the project, but to the
Paulo Alfonso-Sobradinho Project. Thus these benefits,
which are the preservation of land, employment and
production, are also excluded from the rate of return
calculations of the present project, since they exist
at present and are not incremental benefits.
(b) Those that would result from the implementation of the
land reform program, which have been roughly quantified
in the summary of producer benefits table (para 5.06),
and which do not accrue to the new farmers in terms of
incremental production but rather as a result of redistri-
bution of present production and income.
(c) Those that would come from the production component of
the project, i.e., double cropping of rice, which has
been called the irrigation development component, and
(d) Social benefits that would come from the rural develop-
ment components, i.e., schools, potable water supply,
roads, which are small components of total project costs.
5.04      Of the investment expenditures, about 30% would be spent on labor,
creating a total over the four-year construction period, of about 9,000
man-years of employment. In addition, some 18,000 permanent jobs would be
protected (emergency works) and some 4,800 jobs would gd from 60 man-days
per year to full employment (280 working days/year).
5.05      The financial rate of return has been calculated only for the
irrigation development component. As such, it considers as project costs
only those over and above those incurred to maintain present production.
They include irrigation investment costs, on-farm inputs, hired labor, build-
ings, farm equipment, land rent, and charges. On the benefit side, only
incremental production, coming mainly from double cropping of rice, has been
taken into account. Production protected by the dikes is not considered a

benefit of the project as it is present production merely protected from the
effects of the Paulo Alfonso-Sobradinho Complex (para 5.03 (a)).
Adjusted prices for rice and beef have been used, based on Bank price projections,
while internal prices have been used for other crops. Details of prices used
are presented in Annex 13, Tables 4,6,7 and 8. Testing the viability of models
(Annex 13) as to price and cost sensitivity under various assumptions gives
the following results:

Since it is unlikely that sales receipts would be reduced by 10% in view of
conservative technical coefficients and future world price prospects, these
results are considered satisfactory.

5.06      The table on the following page summarizes Producer Benefits.  The
average family income of farmers expected to participate in the project would
be about US$1,500, which would represent a dramatic improvement over present
levels of income: US$200. This improvement in their standards of living
would be only partially due to the productive aspects of the project. An
important share of incremental disposable income comes from the redistribu-
tive, i.e., land reform, components of'the project. Whereas the financial
rates of return have been calculated on the basis ofIfarm ~iodels which assume
an already owned farm, it should be pointed out that this is not the most
common case in the project area, and, unlike the situation in many Bank
projects with similar farm sizes and crops, these are not small farmer-owners
who go from traditional farming to improved farming, but market-oriented,
extremely poor, sharecroppers turned owner-farmers of rice plots. This
accounts for the eight-fold increase'in income.

VI. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
6.01      As indicated in para 5.03, the benefits accruing from project im-
plementation derive not only from the construction of physical facilities
but from a series of inter-related project components, which include agrarian
reform, technical assistance, and social infrastructure investments. By
financing the dikes of the emergency project, not only would some 11,100 ha
of valuabie rice land and the crucial employment opportunities derived from
its use be protected, but the Government would be placed in a very strong
bargaining position vis-a-vis the local landlords, many of whose lands would
otherwise be permanently flooded by the changed river regime. Therefore,
land acquisition would be made easier and land reform possible.
6.02      Through land reform, windfall profits to a few landowners would be
prevented, and a substantial redistribution of income would take place. In
the first phase, some 1,900 new farms would be created and the beneficiaries'
income would be expected to increase some six to eight times at full develop-
ment (para 5.06). Alternative resettlement plans were considered but costs
would be much higher than in the plan adopted, while the marginal return would
be considerably lower. The resettlement of agricultural population elsewhere
in the country on rainfed lands could cost from US$8,000 to 15,000 per family,
depending upon the distance moved, the land to be settled and the services



- 21 -
rendered. In addition, to these direct costs, other major ones would be
incurred through the loss of the only fertile rice lands of the lower Sao
Francisco Valley, and the sociological and economic problems created for the
people resettled and those left behind in the cities of Propria and Itiuba,
which are highly dependent on rice cultivation. Future resettlement in nearby
tabuleiro lands could become a major feature of the second-phase project
(para 4.06) if its feasibility could be demonstrated by the pilot program,
which would be a component of the present project (Annex 5).
6.03      Full development would permit controlled irrigation of rice, thus
making double cropping possible. As a result, output per unit of land would
increase substantially, generating not only incremental production but also
incremental employment (para 5.04). Incremental paddy production would be
about 25,000 tons per year, while 4,800 permanent employment opportunities
would replace part-time jobs as they exist today (60 days per man-year).
6.04      The small social infrastructure component, although only the minimum
necessary to make resettlement on the varzeas of Betume and Marituba possible,
would be important to improve farmlife in the varzeas. It has been demonstrated
that sharecroppers themselves perceive education, potable water, health and
other services as an important non-monetary remuneration. Even at a primary
level, "standards of living" are a major element in decision-taking by
colonists-to-be.
6.05      The impact of the project on institutional development would be
considerable, as the new CODEVASF structure would undertake the complex task
of creating and maintaining an adequate administrative and technical assist-
ance structure in the area. If successful, it would serve as a blueprint
for the much larger second-phase project.
6.06      The project would be the first of a series of agricultural develop-
ment projects that the Government plans to implement throughout the entire
Sao Francisco River Valley and, as such, represents a vehicle for experiment-
ing with different tactics and details of agricultural development in the
region.
6.07      Costs of the emergency works (Annex 4) have been considered to be
costs of the hydroelectric power generation and have not been charged to the
project for the purpose of calculating the rate of return (Annex 14). The
project's overall rate of return to the economy over a period of 35 years is
estimated at 16% (Annex 14). This represents the economic rate of return for
the two varzeas, Betume and Marituba, which would be brought to full develop-
ment. The financial rates of return presented in para 5.05 are considerably
higher than the economic rate of return. The main reason behind this apparent
disparity is that in the latter, family labor has been included. Because
of project design, labor is a very substantial cost in the small farms used
as models and this affects the cost-benefit analysis. The sensitivity of
the economic rate of return has been tested against changes in investment



- 22 -
costs, prices and yields. An increase of investment costs by 10% would reduce
the rate of return to 13%. An increase of 10% in investment costs and a decrease
of 10% in value of production would reduce the rate of return to about 9%. A
10% increase in the value of production because of increased prices or yields
would increase the rate of return by 6 percentage points to 22%.
VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
7.01      During negotiations, assurances were obtained from Government that
it would:
(a) meet any needs for additional rice mill capacity (para 3.07);
(b) insure that sufficient credit funds are made available to
project farmers (para 4.02);
(c) submit feasibility studies for the protection of individual,
or groups of, small varzeas, to the Bank for review prior
to commencement of construction of such works (para 4.03);
(d) acquire all lands required for the project and redistribute
the farmlands within the developed varzeas in accordance
with plans developed in consultation with the Bank (para 4.04);
(e) submit plans by December 31, 1976, acceptable to the Bank,
for resettling or compensating people living on river islands,
or in varzeas or other locations that will be affected
adversely by the change in river regime due to Paulo Afonso-
Sobradinho power operations but that are uneconomic to include
in the project (para 4.07);
(f) insure that adequate initial capital and management are made
available for each cooperative established in the project
area (para 4.09);
(g) submit to the Bank for review, feasibility studies justifying
the selection of specific feeder roads to be included in the
project prior to the commencement of construction of each
road (para 4.12);
(h) give priority for installation of social infrastructure to
villages in the Marituba and Betume varzeas and apply the
selection criteria and investment cost per capita
limitations set fort:. in paragraph 4.13;
(i) build schools, workshops and medical centers only in locations
in which the needed professionals to operate the facilities
are assured (para 4.13);



- 23 -
(j) monitor project progress (para 4.14);
(k) cause CHESF to compensate CODEVASF for the capital cost of
emergency dikes and pumping stations in the project area,
the cost of operating and maintaining such dikes and pumping
stations, and the cost of resettling farmers, sharecroppers,
and farm laborers of the area whose present livelihoods will
not be protected from changes in the regime of the Sao
Francisco River brought about by the construction upstream
of hydroelectric installation by CHESF, or otherwise provide
for these costs (para 4.18);
(1) follow the procurement procedures outlines in paragraph 4.19);
(m)  assure proper maintenance of all project facilities (paras 4.23
and 4.24);
(n) insure that the accounts of CODEVASF and that of the project
are audited annually and that the related auditors' reports
reach the Bank not later than four months after the end of
the CODEVASF fiscal year (para 4.26); and
(o) establish and collect irrigation water charges, in consultation
with the Bank, in accordance with the Government policy to collect
in accordance with the ability of the farmer to pay the charges,
such charges to include a component to repay the capital
investment for the grea benefitted and a component to repay
O&M costs (para 4.28).
7.02      A condition of effectiveness would be the establishment in CODEVASF
of a separate project account, acceptable to the Bank (para 4.26).
7.03      A condition of disbursement of any funds for construction of any
facility or activity which would deprive resident farm families who wish to
continue farming but for whom no land is available, of their livelihood,
would be the submission by Government to the Bank of plans, acceptable to
the Bank, assuring the livelihood of such families (para 4.05).
7.04      Expenditure for design or construction work for dikes, pumping stations,
and irrigation and drainage systems, for cadastral surveys, and for acquisition
of equipment awarded following Bank guidelines and prior,approval by the Bank
of the procedures used, and subsequent to the date (March 17, 1975) of the land
expropriation decree noted in paragraph 4.02 would be eligible for retroactive
financing under the loan up to a maximum expenditure limit of US.S3 million
(para 4.25).
7.05      The proposed project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$23 million
equivalent, for a term of 25 years, including five years of grace.

BRAZIL
LOWER SAO FRANCISCO POLDERS PROJECT
The Project Area
Physical Features
1.        The Lower Sao Francisco Valley is that part of the Sao Francisco
River basin lying downstream if the Paulo Alfonso Rapids (see Map 11560).
This portion drains 33,000 km , representing about 5% of the total river
basin area of 640,520 km2. At the river town of Pao de Acucar, the valley
gradually begins to broaden out int-o flood plains, which increase in size
and importance toward the river mouth. These flood plains, or "varzeas,"
consist of low-lying basins and levees, formed where tributary rivers and
streams join the Sao Francisco. The lower parts of the varzeas are flooded
annually and subsistence fishing is an important subsidiary occupation of
farmers (Annex 6).
2.        The Lower Sao Francisco Valley region, as 2defined in a recent study
commissioned by SUVALE, covers an area of 13,300 km of the 33,000 km2 drain-
age area, and includes 47 municipalities in the states of Alagoas and Sergipe.
The region does not form a homogeneous unit, however, and the river, which
played an important role in colonial times, since it was navigable by small
craft up to Pao de Acucar, is now a natural barrier rather than the primary
avenue of communication.
3.        Three broad zones can be distinguished within the region:
(a) a downstream zone from Propria to the river mouth, with a rain-
fall of 800 to 1,200 mm and including all the main varzeas; the
coastal belt (Atlantic littoral), the tabuleiros (table lands or
plateaus) of Penedo and Neopolis; and the hill lands on both sides
of the river near Propria;
(b) a northern zone centered on Arapiraca, with a rainfall of about
900 mm; and
(c) an upstream zone, with a rainfall of between 600 and 800 mm,
including the region of Alagoas centered around Batalha, and
a number of municipalities to the northwest. This zone also
includes most of the small varzeas.
4.        Within the region, due to limitations of topography and soils and
the lack of groundwater, opportunities for irrigation are largely limited to
the varzeas. A master plan has been prepared for the development of an area
of 207,000 ha which falls entirely within the downstream zone and which, for



ANNEX 1
Page 2
reasons of climate, soils and the possibility of intensive irrigation in the
main varzeas, shows the best potential for further development.
5.        The Polders Emergency Project is mainly concerned with the varzeas
which are found in the 18 riparian municipalities, and with adjoining areas
on the slopes and tabuleiros on each side of the river downstream of Pao de
Acucar. Eight are considered "large," ranging in size from 1,300 to 8,600 ha
and having a combined gross arable area of about 36,000 ha. In addition there
are 68 small varzeas, ranging from 5 to 300 ha, mainly upstream from Propria,
with a total area of 6,600 ha. About 12,300 ha of rice was grown in the eight
large varzeas in 1974 and another 1,100 ha in the small varzeas. Rice is also
grown on islands near the river mouth and in the valleys of the major tribu-
taries above the varzeas, accounting for another 1,000 ha of land devoted to
the crop. Some upland rice is also grown in the heavier rainfall areas.
Table 1 gives figures on the varzea area and rice production and indicates
also the projected totals after completion of the proposed Emergency Project.
6.        Climate.  The area has a semi-humid tropical climate, with rainfall
reaching nearly 1,200 mm near the coast and decreasing gradually to around
500 mm at Pao de Acucar. Between 70% and 75% of the total falls from March
to August. The period from September to February is dry, with rainfall nor-
mally less than 50 mm per month although no month is without some rain. This
regime is in marked contrast to that of the upper part of the river valley
where the main period of rainfall is from December to April.
7.        The mean temperature is around 2500, varying from about 22°C in
August to 270C in January to March. Absolute maximum and minimum temperatures
registered at Propria are 40.8°C and 15.0°C, respectively. Relative humidity
varies from 85% at the height of the rainy season to 70% in the dry season.
Average rainfall exceeds potential evapotranspiration from April to September
in the area downstream of Penedo, where rainfed annual crops can be grown with
a high degree of security. In the upstream zone, yields of annual crops can
be severely depressed by moisture deficiency in years of low rainfall.
8.        Geology.  The entire area is underlain by crystalline rocks of the
basement complex which outcrop, giving rise to undulating hills in the whole of
the lower Sao Francisco basin upstream of Propria. Downstream of Propria, to
the vicinity of Penedo and Neopolis, cretaceous sedimentary rocks give rise
to a sharply undulating topography. The flat-topped tabuleiros of Penedo and
Neopolis are formed by tertiary continental rocks of the Grupo Barreiras. The
estuary and present river valley are filled with alluvial deposits. Dune sands
occupy the Atlantic littoral.
9.        Soils.  The soils that occupy the lower parts of the varzeas are
heavy clays of low permeability which are sticky and plastic when wet. They
have moderate amounts of org.nic matter (1%-3%) and are poor in phosphate but
have good levels of potash. Limited areas have developed salinity and alkali-
nity in the subsoil, but, with regular irrigation and improved drainage, rice
yields should not be affected. These soils are suitable only for rice.
10.       The soils of the levees and terraces (combros) are variable in tex-
ture, with flat to gently undulating topography often disected by well marked



ANNEX 1
Page 3
drainage channels. Farther from the river, soils are mainly fine-textured
silty or sandy clays, fairly well supplied with potash but poor in phosphate,
and suitable for most field crops, vegetables and pasture or fodder crops.
Closer to the river and generally at higher levels, soils are of coarser tex-
tured sandy loams or loamy sands, the coarser ones being heavily leached, and
suitable to some field crops, especially peanuts and manioc (cassava) and
some vegetable crops, as well as fruit trees and coconuts. Due to well de-
veloped microrelief, much of the combro land is difficult to irrigate by
gravity. Transition zones between the combros and the varzea proper have
moderately heavy soils that can be used for rice, or, with improved drainage,
for pasture or most field crops.
11.       On the tabuleiros, soils are keep, well-drained latosols, associated
with patches of coarse quartz sands, and of low natural fertility. They seem
best suited to production of tree crops, sugarcane and pasture, but their
suitability for continuous production of annual crops, even with fertilizer,
is uncertain. The tabuleiros are heavily disected by tributaries of the Sao
Francisco, especially close to the river. The valley slopes have soils of
higher fertility but are subject to erosion. Elsewhere in the project area,
soils are mostly shallow.
12.       River Regime.  The rainfall in the upper Sao Francisco basin (more
than 90% of the drainage area) is characterized by a typical summer rainfall
distribution, in contrast to the autumn-winter distribution in the lower
valley. As a result the river starts to rise in November, to reach a maximum
in January--March, after which it starts to decline, reaching a maximum in
the period August to early October.
a
13.       The Sao 5rancisco River is 2,660 km in length, with a 3total drainage
area of 640,520 km . It has a mean annual discharge of 3,00 m /sec, greater
than that of the Nile. Mean monthly run-off figures (in m /sec) at Traipu,
some 10 km upstream from Propria, with monthly minimum and maximum recorded
flows for the period 1927-59, are shown below:
Upstream rejulation for power projects will increase the minimum
flow to about 2,000 m /sec in 1978.

It is the fact that the river starts to fall at the time the main rainy season
in the region begins that makes the cultivation of rice in the varzeas possible.
The Population
14.       Table 2 gives key socio-economic parameters for Brazil and Northeast
Brazil. The population of the 18 Lower Sao Francisco Valley riparian munici-
palities in 1970 was 213,000, of which 123,000 were classified by domicile
as rural (Table 3). The economically active population was about 64,000,
with 74% engaged in the primary sector, which, except for a small number of
fishermen, is almost exclusively agricultural. The figure for rural popula-
tion does not reflect the proportion actually dependent on agriculture,
however, since many of the residents of the towns, especially the smaller
ones, also engage primarily in agriculture. Therefore the number directly
dependent on agriculture is probably more likely to be between 150,000 and
160,000.
15.       While the rate of increase in population in the Lower Sao Francisco
region between 1960 and 1970 was, on average, 2.6%, there were wide differences
between municipalities. In general, the population in the riparian municipali-
ties remained stagnant or even decreased except in those upstream on the Sergipe
side of the river, which show gains of more than 3%. This is in contrast to
an increase of more than 5% in the tobacco growing municipalities centered in
Arapiraca. A study of the age group breakdown of the population indicates a
fairly large emigration of men, particularly in the 20- to 30-year age group.
16.       Level of income in the Lower Sao Francisco region in 1968 and 1969
was around US$80 per capita per year, being only 50% and 72% of the average
income in the states of Sergipe and Alagoas as a whole and 65% of that for the
northeast of Brazil. The average income of the rural worker was only half that
of his urban counterpart.
17.       The proportion of children attending school in the Lower Sao Francisco
region was considerably lower than that in rural areas in the states of Alagoas
and Sergipe as a whole. In 1970, 81.4% of the rural population over five years
of age was illiterate.
Agriculture in the Lower Sao Francisco
18.       The Varzeas.  The heavy soils of the varzeas and transition zone are
regularly used for the cultivation of rice. The crop depends for its water
supply on the natural flooding of the land by the river and on the rains, al-
though a few farmers have recently installed irrigation pumps.
19.       Land preparation after harvest in October and November is done by
ploughing with a tractor and disc-harrowing, although many small farmers pre-
pare the land by hand or occasionally with livestock, or do no land prepara-
tion at all. Seedbeds are sown on rainfed land from the end of March onwards,
and transplanting by hand begins in the higher parts of the varzeas in the



ANNEX 1
Page 5
middle of April, depending on the time at which the flood receds. In these
higher areas, farmers have constructed banks to retain the flood water as long
as possible, some with gates, as in the Propria varzea and many small varzeas,
by which the drainage of the flood waters can be regulated. Transplanting
continues as the water gradually recedes, and may go on until the end of June.
Heavy local rains, however, cause renewed flooding from the tributaries and
result in the need for replanting in the lower parts of the basin. Due to the
deep flooding of most of the area, commencing in the dry season soon after the
land is ploughed, weeds pose very little problem and normally no weeding is
done.
20.       Harvesting is by hand and starts in mid-August, continuing to the
end of October or middle of November. Under present conditions mechanical
harvesting is not possible as the crop is too uneven in maturity, but thresh-
ing is normally by machine, except for quantities for home consumption which
may be threshed by hand. An early Sao Francisco flood may cause problems in
the harvest of late planted land.
21.       Yields vary from year to year, depending on the Sao Francisco flood,
the regularity of the rainfall and the occurrence of late floods from the
tributaries which may cause considerable losses. Yield data for 1972 and
1973 were collected in a sample survey of the main varzeas and are summarized
below:

/1   Excludes one large farmer with pump irrigation.
/2   Excludes one very large farmer with very low yields in both years.
22.       1973 was considered a normal year while 1972 was a poor one due to
irregularity of the rainfall and losses caused by late flooding from the
tributaries, especially Boacica. In the feasibility study of Propria/Itiuba
(with data covering a period of 10 years), it was found that the average yield
in these two varzeas was 1,500 kg/ha.
23.       From the information available, it may be concluded that, for the
downstream varzeas of Brejo Grande, Betume and Marituba, which have heavier
and more reliable rainfall, yields in normal years are about 2,400 kg/ha,
with an average of 2,000 kg/ha. For the upstream group of Boacica, Cotinguiba,
Pindoba, Itiuba and Propria, the normal yield is about 1,800 kg/ha and the
average is 1,600 kg/ha.

24.       The main factor limiting increases in yields is the lack of effec-
tive water control. Depth of water in the rice fields during the growing
season may vary from 0 to 120 cm or more. Fertilizers are not used except
on the seedbeds, since lack of water or excessive amounts may easily result
in no benefit being obtained. Tall growing, slow maturing (145 days) varie-
ties must be grown since short higher yielding varieties may easily be sub-
merged. Since the date of transplanting cannot be controlled, seedings 40
to 45 days old are often transplanted. This accounts for the high seed rate
used and for the fact that six to eight plants are often transplanted at each
hole because, with late transplanting, there is practically no tillering and
shorter and younger plants would also run the risk of being submerged. The
crop, particularly in the lower parts of the varzeas, is liable to lodging,
causing considerable losses in grain and reduction in quality.
25.       A small number of larger farmers have installed pumps, enabling them
to irrigate the upper parts of the varzeas and obtain improved water control.
D)ikes are laid out approximately on the contour at vertical intervals of bet-
ween 10 and 25 cm; however, little leveling is done between the dikes. Under
these conditions, with limited use of fertilizer (40 kg N and 60 kg P205 per
ha), yields of 3 to 4 tons/ha of paddy rice are reported.
26.       With pump irrigation, double cropping is now being practiced by one
or two farmers on land not normally flooded. The results have been promising
although, due to the small areas sown, the second crop may suffer heavily
from damage by birds.
27.       The "Combros" - Levees, Terraces and River Banks.  The "combros"
occur at many different elevations and, while the lower parts are inundated
at least for short periods in most years, the upper parts are inundated only
occasionally. Many farmers live in houses sited on the highest points along
the river banks and have established small plantations of coconut, oranges,
bananas and mangoes immediately around their houses, while, on the lower lands,
subsistance crops, including maize, beans and cassava as well as cotton, are
grown.
28.       Yields of cotton and subsistence crops on the combros are potentially
higher than on the tabuleiros since the soils are of much better quality and
more moisture is available. Cotton intercropped with other crops averages
300 kg/ha; maize, 800 kg/ha; beans, 600 kg/ha; and cassava, 12 tons/ha. When
grown as single crops without irrigation but with fertilizer, cotton yields
1,600 to 1,800 kg/ha and maize, 2,200 to 2,400 kg/ha. The proportion of
"combro" land to rice land varies considerably from varzea to varzea as does
the extent to which it is utilized. For the areas for which data are available,
the land use in 1972 was:

29.       The Plateau.  The pattern of agriculture on the plateau shows con-
siderable variation, depending on rainfall and soil type. In the eastern
part of the region, with a rainfall in excess of 1,000 mm on latosols, the
land (tabuleiros) has remarkably few crops under cultivation (cassava, beans
and corn) and the cattle population is also low. Fruit trees are grown on a
limited scale (mango, oranges, cashew, passion fruit, pawpaw) to supply local
markets, and coconuts are also planted on favorable sites. The cooperative
settlements of Pindorama and Penedo lie in this zone and their financial
structures are based on the cultivation of passion fruit (maracuja), but,
recently, problems have arisen as a result of disease, (Fusarium) which has
reduced the bearing life of the vines from five to two years. The Pindorama
cooperative is now trying to broaden its economic base by planting coconuts,
cashews, pineapple and sugarcane in addition to subsistence crops.
30.       Underutilization of land in this area appears to stem from a number
of factors: (a) the low to moderate inherent fertility of the soils; (b) the
fact that rainfall in the area is less than the optimum for sugarcane, which
is an important crop on similar soils a little farther to the north; and (c)
that, after clearing, the land is rapidly recolonized by a dense growth of
mata (scrub), producing little in the way of grazing for cattle and making
establishment of improved pasture difficult and expensive. The average size
of holding appears to be larger than that in many other parts of the project
area, with about two-thirds of the land in holdings over 100 ha. The land
ownership pattern may, however, well be a reflection of difficulties experi-
enced in developing this land rather than a reason for underutilization.
31.       In the northern zone, the cultivation of tobacco has developed
rapidly in recent years and is still expanding. About 40,000 ha are now devoted
to the crop and it is the most important one cultivated in the zone. Most
holdings are quite small, averaging 1 to 1-1/2 ha per family and are often
rented on an annual basis. Land preparation and all cultural operations are
done by hand. Larger producers with holdings averaging about 15 ha, employ
labor to cultivate and care for the crop. Land use is intensive and no ro-
tation is practiced, with some areas having been under continuous tobacco
cultivation for more than 20 years. Nematodes are a problem. The variety
grown is of local origin and is marketed either as cured leaf for export to
Europe (mainly to France) or as corda (twist tobacco) for sale internally.
Fairly high levels of fertilizer are used (80-100 kg N, 60-70 kg P205, 90 kg
K20 per ha). Yields average 1,600 to 1,800 kg per ha of air-dried leaf. After
the first picking, beans, cotton and sometimes cassava are interplanted to make
use of the residual fertilizer.
32.       The northeastern part of the region includes an important milk pro-
ducing zone, dealing with the markets in Maceio and Recife. The cattle herd
is made up of crossbred Holsteins and it is being further upgraded with pedi-
greed Holstein bulls. Cows depend on natural grazing, with cultivated "palma
forrageira"' (Spineless Cactus) as a dry season forage reserve, plus fairly high
levels of concentrates. However, with large increases in the cost of the con-
centrates but a controlled price for milk, farmers have recently tended to sell
their stock for slaughter.



ANNEX 1
Page 8
33.       The whole of this northeastern region, with a rainfall varying from
about 700 to 900 mm, is also an important area for cotton, beans and maize,
with relatively intensive land use. Because crops are normally mixed, plant
populations for individual crops are low. Cotton yields average only 200
kg/ha.
34.       The hilly areas around Propria and on both sides of the river have
been developed mainly for cattle raising. Improved pastures of guinea grass
have been planted on a large scale and the area is heavily stocked. The south-
eastern part of the project area (Porto de Folha, Pao de Acucar) has a low
rainfall and is used for extensive cattle raising on unimproved caatinga and
semi-arid pastures.
35.       The Atlantic Littoral.  This area of course dune sands is used only
for coconuts. The soils are podsolic, heavily leached in the surface and
sometimes having a hard pan, which can severely limit the development of the
trees. Over 90% of the production comes from properties of over 100 ha and
the only cultivation provided is occasional clearing of bush growth. Yields
average about 2,500 nuts per hectare (25 nuts per tree) and, apart from a
small proportion used for local consumption, the whole crop is shipped as
shelled nuts to processing plants in Maceio.
Agricultural Production
36.       Data for agricultural production in the riparian municipalities are
shown in Table 3. The value of crop production per hectare averaged Cr$ 677,
ranging from 1,416 in Penedo where it is increased by production of fruit and
vegetables for the urban market, to less than Cr$ 300 in some of the upstream
municipalities. Livestock production made a remarkably small contribution,
only 9% of the total. The importance of rice in the varzeas is reflected in
the fact that, while in 1972 (not a favorable year for rice production) it
occupied only 22% of the cropped area and 3% of the total land area, it accoun-
ted for 36.7% of the total value of production. Although, over the region as
a whole, rice accounts for 35 to 40% of production, in some municipalities,
such as Propria and Telha, it contributed over 80% of the total value of pro-
duction.

LOWER SAO FRANCISCO POLDERS PROJECT
Agricultural Credit, Processing and Marketing
1.        A principal feature of the project is that it is required to offset
losses to be caused by another Bank-financed project. Therefore, most of
the "incremental production" is present production, which otherwise would
be lost. For these reasons, the bulk of the production of the project will
be marketed as it is being marketed today and through the same channels.
Similarly, future demand for credit is not expected to grow substantially
as a result of project implementation, mainly because at present all rice
production is done with credit on-lent to the sharecroppers through the land-
owners. As the main incremental credit demand would come from double cropping
of rice, it is unlikely that the amounts demanded would be significantly
larger, but, on the other hand, the terms of loans would go from nine to
twelve months.
Credit
2.        Lending Agencies. 1/  During 1973, 99% of the agricultural credit
in the project area was provided by two banks:  Banco do Brasil (85%) and
Banco do Nordeste (14%). Even though the vast number of loans were for
agriculture (89%), they represented only around half of the total amount
lent. The other half went to livestock enterprises, which are growing at
an accelerated rate.
3.        Of the total of Cr$ 151.4 million lent in the project area, 73%
was spent in agriculture and livestock enterprises: Cr$ 110.3 million (US$2.3
million). This reflects the predominance of agriculture as the main economic
activity of the region. In the period from June 30, 1973 to June 30, 1974,
agricultural lending in the project area was distributed as follows:
1/   Lending agencies at the project area include the agencies of Banco do
Brasil (BB) and Banco do Nordeste do Brasil, S.A. (BNB).

4.        In agricultural lending, rice, citrus and foodstuff crops received
the largest share, while in livestock lending, beef received almost all.
Some 55% of all agricultural credit was investment credit, mainly for beef,
dairy and fruit orchards. The 45% devoted to short-term operations was
heavily concentrated on rice and foodstuff cultivation (Table 1).
5.        Size of Loans.  Detailed information on distribution of loans
according to loan size is not available. 1/ Average size of the loan was
Cr$ 40,000 (US$5,280). These figures, however, include cooperatives as a
single entity; therefore, the real average for farm loans is lower. BNB has
a Cr$ 11,000 limit on the loger end of the scale. while the BB loan floor is
Cr$ 1,000. BNB agencies have only two operations of Cr$ 500,000 or more
while BB reports 25 operations of that amount or more. These figures, how-
ever, exclude the direct credit received by the sharecroppers from the
landowners.
6.        Source of Funds.  Roughly half of the funds actually lent for
agriculture and livestock come from the banks' own resources, while the other
half is provided for by PROTERRA. Less than 2% comes from various minor
sources, including one Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) program.
7.        Terms and Conditions.  It could be said that the banks use most of
their own funds for conventional lending in agriculture. Capital investment
loans carry 15% interest and up to five-year terms (with a two-year grace
period). Short-term lending varies from 12 to 15% interest and normally is
lent for one vear but could be extended to 24 months. Loan terms under
PROTERRA are extremely attractive. They range from 0% rate of interest for
technological inputs (fertilizers, pesticides, seeds) on one-year loans,
to 7% interest and up to 12-year terms (six years of grace) for land improve-
ment and establishment of new crops (Table 2).
1/   Information for the state of Sergipe is presented in Table 1.  Average
size of loan was in 1973 Cr$ 30,800. Adding the monetary correction to
make figures comparable, the Cr$ 40,000 indicated in the text seems to
represent a fair average.



ANNEX 2

8.        Repayment Record.  Debt collection is good.  On average, the agencies
have 2.2% defaults. Two large agencies have less than 0.5% defaults. If loans
in arrears (but recoverable) are included, less than 4% of the amount lent is
in default. According to the managers, defaulting occurs mainly among the
medium and small borrowers when drought hits the area, but they report near
zero arrears in good agricultural years.
Processing and Marketing
9.        By far the most important product is rice, accounting for 80% of
total value of production in the project area. Paddy production, as it has
been pointed out before, is scattered among many thousands of small producers
(sharecroppers), but its marketing is concentrated in some 14 processing plants.
After processing, 60% of the white rice goes to the internal consumption of
the region while 40% is exported to the cities of Recife, Maceio, Garanhuns,
and Aracaju. Nevertheless, regional production is not enough to meet local
demand all year round and rice produced in Rio Grande do Sul and Maranhao is
a substantial part of the consumption during the dry months.
10.       Rice processing is confined to a few rice mills. characterized
by a very small throughput of the order of 70 bagsper day, which is less
than 3,000 kg/day (Table 3). In addition, these rice mills are old and
technologically inadequate, producing excessive broken grain. This, coupled
with the lack of facilities for storage and of capital to stockpile for the
non-producing months, leads to an irrational pattern of marketing by which
the project area exports the grain immediately after harvest to other regions
or states and import a more expensive rice from Rio Grande do Sul, which is
3,000 km away, during the non-producing months. Furthermore, the wholesalers
of Maceio and Aracaju, knowing these conditions, offer substantially lower
prices to the rice mill owners than those prevalent in the large cities.
These (the rice mill owners), in order to survive, then pass the low prices
for the paddy to the landlords, who, in turn, pay their sharecroppers an
even lower price. Thus, not having adequate storage capacity nor the financial
capacity to stockpile, the sharecropper-landlord-rice mill owner-wholesaler
chain works only to the advantage of the latter.
11.       In addition to present rice production (12,700 tons white rice)
protected by the project, an estimated incremental production over and above
it of some 15,000 tons is expected at full development. Total demand for the
Lower Sao Francisco region for 1982 is expected to be of the order of 40,000
tons of white rice. Therefore, projected demand far outstrips projected
production. However, marketing and milling arrangements demand substantial
improvement if they are to cope with the changed situation resulting from the
project.
12.       Preliminary plans to solve these problems are under consideration
by CODEVASF and other federal agencies. They propose to build two or three
additional rice mills with processing capacities of 1 to 2 tons per hour,



ANNEX 2
Page 4
or 15 to 30 tons a day. 1/ They would be located in the producing areas and
would have attached dryers and silos for proper storage and continuous
functioning all year round, thus reducing imports of rice to a minimum.
Ownership or operation of these would be preferably through cooperatives of
producers. It should be pointed out, however, that these sound ideas are
at present no more than vague plans and that they are far from being con-
crete development plans. If cooperative ownership by the farmers were to
become a reality, the Bank should be prepared to assist them as it is a
necessary and important part of the full development of the valley.
13.       Other incremental production over the above present protected pro-
duction is not important. For beef, cotton, maize, beans and peanuts,
production would be in the order of 1,000 tons or less per year per item.
Only tomatoes would reach some 5,000 tons, and Ilot more than 2,000 tons of
these would need to be exported outside the Lower Sao Francisco area
(Table 4).
March 1975
1/   Roughly 10 times larger than the average rice mill functioning today.

ANNEX 3

BRAZIL
LOWER SAO FRANCISCO POLDERS PROJECT
The Agrarian Structure
1.        The agro-economic systems of the area and the resulting land tenure
structure have been, and are, shaped by rice cultivation. Available infor-
mation for four varzeas indicates that some 40% of cultivable land is devoted
to rice, 10% to other annual crops, ,% to permanent crops, and pastures, both
artificial and natural, some 11 and 25%, respectively (see Table 1). The
lowlands (the varzeas proper), which are regularly flooded, include most of
the rice cultivation. The levees and recent river terraces ("combros"),
which are flooded in varying degrees only during higher floods. are used
mainly for dryland crops, pastures, and, occasionally, rice. The proportion
of combro land in each basin varies considerably, but it ranges from 20 to
40% of total basin area. Finally, the plateau area (!tabuleiros") is used,
at present, for extensive livestock grazing, shifting cultivation of subsist-
ence crops and, on very limited areas, for fruit trees (mainly coconut trees).
Poor fertility and drought are the main limitations of the tabuleiros, but
when these can be overcome on selected sites, cotton, tobacco, sugarcane and
other commercial crops are grown successfully.
2.        The predominance of rice as the main economic crop is not only
measured by the area sown, but also by the 37% share of total value of pro-
duction of the valley and 601 of the value of production it represents in
the project area. In terms of employment, it is estimated that 11,000 families
in the project area derive their main income from rice cultivation. These
represent a total of some 50,000 persons dependent on rice cultivation for
subsistence.
Land Tenure
3.        With a total agricultural area of 16,000 ha susceptible to intensive
cultivation and a high population density, pressure for land ownership and
land use is high (Table 2). Nevertheless, some 7% of the farms occupy 82%
of the land, while less than 100 practically control 90% of the land. 1/
4.        The degree of concentration varies from varzea to varzea.  A rough
indicator dealing with the percentage of land in farms of more than 20 ha
varies from 61% in Cotinguiba, 64% in Boacica, 88% in Betume, to 97% in
Marituba. However, these figures underestimate the degree of concentration
of income since they do not reflect the sharecropping arrangements that are
the main tenancy structure for rice cultivation.
1/   Because the cadastral survey accounts only for farms and does not
provide information for double ownership, it is likely that the figures
presented above underestimate the degree of land concentration.



ANNEX 3
Page 2
Sharecropping
5.        On the varzeas, sharecroppers normally cultivate about 1 to 1.5 ha
of rice land and have the right to plant about 1 ha of combro land with sub-
sistence crops. Land preparation, provision of the transplants, and water
control (if any) are the responsibility of the proprietor, while transplant-
ing, harvesting and threshing are undertaken by the sharecropper and his
family, in return for which they receive a nominal 50% of the crop. The
proprietor gives advances for family subsistence during the crop season, has
the right to fix the price of rice at repayment time (harvest), and demands
payment in kind. These, and other practices forced by the landlord, make
sharecropping more of a 2/3 to the landlord and 1/3 to the sharecropper
arrangement than the nominal 50-50. As a result, although the gross income
of a sharecropping family from 1 ha of rice and 1 ha of subsistence crops
is in the order of US$200 per year, its net disposal income is likely to
amount to some US$100 per year. It is clear then, that the 8,000 sharecroppers
and their families are among the poorest of the rural poor of the Northeast of
Brazil. 1/
6.        Such families supplement their meager cash income by daily fishing
in the river, which provides as much as 50% ofthe animal protein consumed,
and by cultivation of rainfed plots on combro land where they produce small
amounts of subsistence crops: manioc, beans and some corn. Very little of
this produce is marketed.
Hired Labor
7.        In the project area, salaried labor of a permanent nature amounts
to a negligible portion of the population. The main reasons for this are
the dominance of the absentee landlord-sharecropper arrangement -- and the
absence of alternative sources of employment. A few work outside the project
area in Arapiraca as daily wage laborers on tobacco farms (50 km from Penedo)
and some find seasonal employment cutting sugarcane in some areas of the
tabuleiros. Occasionally, public works provide temporary employment.
The Proiect
8.        Heavy concentration of land, extremely unequal income distribution
and the absence of employment alternatives for the vast majority of the popu-
lation of the project area indicate that, unless substantial changes are made
in the existing tenure and employment patterns, the Emergency Ifoject has the
strong, and, indeed, to some degree, almost certain potential to increase
concentration of income, to result in the eviction of many sharecroppers and
their families from the varzeas and to produce windfall profits through vastly
increased land values for the present owners. 2/
1/   Average rural income in the Northeast is US$200 per year per capita.
2/   It is interesting to note that at the June 26, 1974 meeting of the Board
of Directors, Mr. McNamara indicated that ... "attention was being paid
to recapturing capital gains accruing to real estate beneficiaries of
Bank projects."



ANNEX 3
Page 3
9.        If no reshaping of the land tenure structure takes place, a very
limited number of already wealthy individuals would reap a sizeable proportion
of the benefits of the project. In fact, owners with large land holdings,
numbering not more than 100 persons in the whole project area and making up
only 7% of the total number of landowners, would, through the ownership and
double ownership of 82% of the land, capture about 90% of the capital gains.
These would be substantial, as the value of the land which would be permanently
flooded by the increase in water levels due to the Paulo Alfonso Project,
would be near zero. In addition, the control over the floods provided by the
project would permit large-scale mechanization of rice cultivation, particularly
during harvest and seeding, which accounts for 60% of total demand for farm
labor. The effect of a development of this nature upon the sharecropping
population could hardly be exaggerated. 1/ It should be borne in mind that
sharecropping is a way of spreading the risk for the landowner, as well as
the sharecropper. As the risk decreases by virtue of flood control provided
by dikes and pumps, the tendency of the landowner to shift from sharecropping
to direct cultivation, and from labor-intensive to mechanized operations in
large farms is unavoidable.
Acquisition of Land 2/
10.       Acquisition of the land by the Government would be a precondition
of project approval. The reasons for doing so are threefold. First, it would
prevent a small number of large landlords from reaping sizeable profits.
Prices of rice land as they stand now are Cr$ 3,000 to 3,600 per ha. Once
the floods are regulated, it is estimated that they could treble. There is
then a clear economic advantage in acquiring land prior to project implement-
ation. Second, CODEVASF's position in negotiating with the landlords is
strong before initiation of works since the threat of owning nothing but
flooded land is a convincing element. On the other hand, if negotiations
are held after the project has been carried out, the advantage is obviously
lost. Third, this has been the approach CODEVASF has already used in the
Propria and Itiuba varzeas in the same area in 1973. Hence, the legal and
financial mechanisms to acquire land in a reasonably efficient manner already
exists.
Resettlement
11.       The resettlement aspects of the project are twofold:  first, there
is the resettlement within the varzeas, and, second, there is the resettlement
1/   In effect, this already is a point of conflict in the area.  There were
reports that sharecropping had "blacklisted" one or two landowners who
used machinery on the grounds that they were depriving people of their
livelihood. By their refusal to work on those farms, the trend was
temporarily halted.
2/   A frequent source of confusion has been the use of the word "expropriation"
instead of "acquisition" when referring to land in the Brazilian context.
Brazilian policy is against "expropriation" and what the Government actually
does is buy from landowners at very near market prices. There is nothing
confiscatory in this approach so the Bank should be careful not to create an
issue where there is none.



ANNEX 3

on nearby tabuleiro land for surplus population which has been unable to obtain
land in the varzeas (and surrounding combro lands). This last resettlement
program would be deferred until a second phase Lower Sao Francisco Project,
mainly because there is very little agro-economic information on tabuleiro
agriculture. Also, since resettlement would take place on only two of the
six large vatzeas in the first phase, the numbers of displaced families will
not be known for about three or four years after commencement of the first
phase. In addition, resettlement on tabuleiro land would demand heavy
infrastructural investment and services from CODEVASF, which would be extremely
busy with the emergency works to protect the varzeas. Therefore, only a pilot
project and some field research would be included in the present project for
tabuleiro land. The following analysis then will focus only on the resettle-
ment within the varzeas.
12.       As described in earlier paragraphs, the demographic pressure on
the land is enormous. One important policy matter which would influence
greatly the amount of land redistribution which could occur would concern
the size of the new units to be created. If the criteria used in Propria and
Itiuba (4 ha of rice land per farm) were to be applied, a substantial number
of families would be displaced. In determining the size of units, three main
criteria would have to be set in practical balance. These deal with providing
A miftimuft income to the new farmer, since, according to Government regulations,
new colonization schemes should provide at least four times the minimum wage
per family; 1/ full utilization of family labor with as little hired labor as
possible; and resettlement within the varzeas of as many families as possible.
13.       Obviously there is not a single solution that would optimize the
above criteria. From the farm models, it would appear that the type of farm
units meeting the criteria are: 2.5 ha of rice land (under full irrigation)
plus 0.5 ha irrigated combro land; 2 irrigated ha of rice land plus 2 ha
unirrigated combro land; and 12 ha tainfed improved pastures for livestock
fattening also on combro land. The first two are the most important.
Supporting Services
14.       The reorganization of the land tenure structure would not be limited
to farms. It would also demand a heavy input in terms of management and
supporting services, which are at present provided by the landlords at an
exorbitant price. The organization of cooperatives for providing inputs and
the marketing of produce would be an essential element of the scheme. 2/
1/   If this criterion were fully met, income per family benefited by the
resettlement program would jump by roughly 10 times, while those left
out by excessive size of farms would risk losing their meager income
to mechanization, made possible by controlled irrigation and drainage.
2/   These aspects are dealt with separately in Annex 5.



ANNEX 3

15.       In summary, the problems derived from the land tenure structure in
the Lower Sao Francisco are a critical issue of the project, since they put
to test both the Bank and the Government policies toward the rural poor. In
this project, unlike many others, there is an explicit commitment derived
from the loan documents of the Paulo Alfonso IV Project. 1/ In these documents
it is stated that ... "within fifteen months after the date of this agreement
(June 17, 1974) prepare a comprehensive development program to cause the
benefits of the Lower Sao Francisco Emergency Project ... to be shared equitably
by landholders, sharecroppers and laborers in the area of such project." 2/

BRAZIL
LOWER SAO FRANCISCO POLDERS PROJECT
Principal Project Facilities
Background
1.        The Sao Francisco River is one of the world's great rivers, having
an annual average discharge to the sea of almost 100 billion cubic meters,
greater than that of the Nile (Annex 1), of excellent quality water for irri-
gation. The river normally has only one large flood crest in the lower valley,
peaking during the January-March period and then slowly receding to minimum
levels in August-September. Occasionally (about 7 times in 45 years), a
second, smaller peak occurs after the main flood. The floods are governed
almost entirely by the rainy season in the interior river basin, which precedes
by several months the rainy season in the lower valley. The unusual combination
of early floods and late rains in the project area makes possible the culti-
vation of rice in the varzeas.
2.        The varzeas are low-lying flood plains with fertile alluvial soils,
formed where tributary rivers and streams join the Sao Francisco in its lower'
reaches. About 16,000 ha of rice are cultivated annually on the varzeas,
with the majority of farmers being small landowners or sharecroppers, and
the usual rice farm being only about 1 to 1.5 ha in size (Annex 3). As the
annual floods recede, the fari'ers follow and transplant rice seedlings into
the main fields. The late rains provide additional water for the rice. Only
one crop per year is grown, with yields being in the 1.5 to 2.0 tons/ha range.
3.        Completion in 1978 of several new units of the upstream Paulo Afonso
hydroelectric power complex (Bank Loan 1008-BR) will change the river regime,
with the following adverse effects on Lower Valley agriculture (unless
corrective actions are taken).
(a) The minimum flow will increase from 700 m 3Is to 2,000 m /s, which
would permanently flood about 3,000 ha of varzea rice land.
(b) The frequency and magnitude of flooding will be reduced, which
would decrease the area flooded 80% of the time (which is the
area used for rice) by about 11,000 ha.
(c) Daily fluctuations in the river levels due to turbine peaking
will be as much as 1 to 2 meters.
(d)  During a prolonged drought, all floods would be eliminated for
periods as long as 58 consecutive months.



ANNEX 4
Page 2
4.        The primary objective of the Emergency Project would be to offset
these adverse effects, insofar as would be economically or practically fea-
sible, on six major varzeas and several small varzeas (less than 500 ha in
size) in the Lower Valley. Protection already has been provided to the two
other major varzeas. The number of small varzeas protected would depend
upon their relative costs of protection. Less than half may have sufficient
land to justify such an investment. Feasibility studies for individual or
groups of small varzeas would be submitted to the Bank for review prior to
commencement of any construction work in such varzeas.
Protection Plan and Alternatives
5.        Basic Plan.  The basic protection plan for the varzeas would be the
provision of dikes and dual-purpose irrigation-drainage pumps. Their function
would be to permit farming to continue in the varzeas with existing cultural
practices. The complete "wild flooding" of the varzeas would be maintained
artificially. Operations would be as follows:'
(a) As the river rises to flood stage, normally beginning in
November or December, control gates in the dikes would be
opened and the river permitted to flood the varzea to what-
ever natural flood height might result. If the flood were
to be a "low" flood, or if there were no floods, leaving
significant amounts of productive lands unflooded, the pumps
would move additional water into the varzea until the lake
inside the dike reached the desired elevation.
(b) As the flood level recedes, the control gates would permit
the impounded waters to drain back into the river. The
farmers would follow their existing practice of retaining
some of the water in paddies, and transplanting rice into
the paddies.
(c) Since the minimum river level in the future would be higher
than before, impounded water in varzeas areas at elevations
below the new minimum river levels would be pumped (drained)
into the river. At the completion of this stage the farmers
would cultivate as they do now, utilizing rainfall to the
maximum practicable extent during the growing season.
(d)  Streams flowing into the varzea would be diverted around the
varzea in the case of large flows, or drained through the
dikes by gravity or by pumping. Excess rainfall on the varzeas
would be drained by gravity or by pumping.
(e) No new drainage canals or irrigation networks would be
constructed in the varzeas. The "internal system" would
remain pre-project, except for such improvement as individual
farmers undertake on their own initiative.  Distribution of
water would come only with total inundation of the varzea.



ANNEX 4
Page 3
(f) During the growing season the dikes would protect the crops
from daily river fluctuations and from the "second floods"
which have occured occasionally.
6.        The elevation to which the dikes would be constructed for the Basic
Plan would be sufficient to impound water in the varzea up to the level of the
8 in 10 year flood, which would provide water to almost all of the lands
normally having rice. Cost estimates for such a system for each of the six
major varzeas are shown in Table 1. However, these costs are for dikes built
to elevations which are compatible with flood frequencies (after upstream
regulation; the future condition) of once in 50 years, except in the case of
Pindoba varzea, which is based on a once in 20 year frequency. The reason
for use of the higher frequency is explained subsequently in paragraph 12.
Hence the indicated costs are higher than minimum costs by from 10% to 20%.
7.        The unit costs derived from those costs and the gross protected
areas from Table 1, Annex 1, indicate an average investment cost of US$380/ha
and an average annual O&M cost of US$17/ha, with maximums of US$766/ha and
US$28/ha, and minimum of US$213/ha and US$12/ha, respectively. For the var-
zea with the highest unit costs (Cotinguiba, one of the smaller "large" var-
zeas) the rice area was about 1,100 ha. Assuming that all the protection
would be for the benefit of rice lands only, the unit investment cost would
be US$1,100/ha. The investment for an average farm rice plot then would be
about US$1,650/family, or US$2,750/family if it would have 2.5 ha.
8.        Alternatives Considered.  Some logical possible alternative plans
were considered by the Government before deciding on the Basic Emergency
Plan. One of the first was that of paying an indemnity to the farmers and
letting the vatzea lands revert to the vagaries of the new river regime.
Practically all of the small farmers and sharecroppers would have to move
elsewhere, as they could not depend for their livelihood on a stream which
might not provide them any water for several years in succession. Around
11,000 families would be involved, and the Government could not simply aban-
don them to their own ingenuity. To resettle them elsewhere in the country
on rainfed lands would cost from US$8,000 to US$15,000 per family, depending
upon the-distance moved, the land to be settled, and the services rendered.
No ready land, rainfed or irrigated, is available in the area. There were
many other strong sociological and political arguments against such an al-
ternative, and it was discarded early in the planning.
9.        Another alternative considered was that of building only low dikes,
high enough only to protect against the raised minimum river levels, and then
pumping water into the varzeas. This would require the construction of an
irrigation distribution system to reach the farm plots, and the cost of such
a system, together with even small dikes, would equal or exceed the emergency
plan adopted. During flood years, heavy maintenance expenses would be in-
curred to remove the silt from canals and structures. Hence this alternative,
and variations of it, were dropped after early consideration.



ANNEX 4
Page 4
Full Development and Irrigation and Drainage Systems
10.       With protection provided against the changed river regime, improve-
ment of agricultural production in the varzeas would be a logical undertaking,
especially in view of an unlimited supply of irrigation water throughout the
year in the river. The Government plans to provide complete irrigation and
drainage systems in all the major varzeas, thus permitting double cropping of
rice. Because of the amount of work involved, only two varzeas, Marituba and
Betume, would receive these systems during this first project phase. The
other four varzeas would be fully developed in a second phase project.
11.       A fully developed varzea would have much greater values to be pro-
tected against floods than when only one rice crop per year is produced.
Hence higher levees (from 1 to 3 meters higher) would be justified. The
height of the levee would be determined by economic comparison of the margi-
nal cost of increased protection by added dike height, to the marginal return
from the increased area protected by the increased height. Preliminary analy-
ses by the Government consultants indicated that the econmic height for most
large varzeas was that sufficient to protect against about a one year in 50
year flood. The economic "frequency" height would vary with the conditions
in each varzea. For some, the frequency would not be more than one year in
20.
12.       In the case of the four varzeas which would not be fully developed
in the project, it would be economically justified to build the emergency
dikes to the full development height during this project. The reason for this
derives from the relativelyismall additional height needed to raise emergency
dike levels up to full development dikes levels, and the fact that this could
not be done satisfactorily by adding this incremental height later. A good
bond between the old and new dike sections would be essential to eliminate
any possibility of an easy seepage path for flood waters occurring along a
zone of poor bond, thereby endangering the stability of the dike. To assure
a good bond and proper compaction of the new fill, the old dike would have to
be levelled and the new dike built in place. Hence the result would be that
two dike systems would have to be constructed, at a considerably greater cost
than building one to the final height initially. The relatively short time
of four years between time of construction of the emergency dikes and the
need for full development dikes, which would be applicable in this case,
was also significant in the economic comparison.
Description of Main Facilities
13.       Dikes.  All main river dikes would have a crest width of 4 m, a free-
board of 1 m above design flood height, and side slopes of 2 horizontal to 1
vertical for internal and external faces. Average dike heights would vary
according to varzea bank prifiles and location along the river, but would
be about 3 to 4 meters. At Brejo Grande, nearer the mouth of the river, the
average height would be only about 2 meters. Maximum heights would not be
more than about 7 meters. All would be constructed of well-compacted earth.



ANNEX 4
Page 5
14.       Pumping Stations and Drainage.  These would be designed from a
drainage standpoint to obtain an economic balance between the costs of pre-
venting all pondage of excess drainage water, and the losses incurred by
ponding on the lower fields for varying periods of time. Some of the larger
tributary streams would be diverted around the varzeas, where physically and
economically possible to do so, to reduce required pumping capacity. In some
instances temporary offstream spreading grounds would be used to reduce peak
drainage inflows (Boacica). For the varzeas with full developmer.t, drainage
pumping requirements normally would govern the number and sizing of pumps.
For the emergency works, filling of the varzeas on an eight of 10 years frequency
basis in some cases would require as much capacity as would the surface drain-
age criteria, which in the preliminary designs was based on one in five year
rainfall intensities and durations. The criteria used would be reappraised
by CODEVASF and the consultants at the beginning of the final designs for
both emergency and full development works, and would be reviewed by the Bank
before designs are finalized. No subsurface drainage systems would be in-
cluded, as the natural subsurface drainage appears adequate. Should areas of
water-logging occur, corrective drainage systems would be included in a second-
phase project.
15.       Most pumping stations would be designed to serve both drainage and
irrigation purposes, the exceptions being the irrigation booster pumping sta-
tions. Station capacities would range from about 0.25 m3/sec for some of the
latter, to 35 m3/sec for the main pumping station in the Boacica varzea. The
preliminary design for the Boacica pumping station envisages a battery of 10
pumps with each having an i.ndividual capacity of 3.5 m3/sec. Pumping heads
would vary from 4 m to about 8.5 m, depending upon station location.
16.       Irrigation Systems (Full Development).  Water would be pumped from
the river into unlined canals and distributed by gravity, booster pumps being
used to reach the more distant and higher varzea elevations. Canal capacities
would be designed for the following criteria, which are subject to modification
for local variations in soils.
Rice:
24-hour/day irrigation
Canal losses: 10%
Peak canal delivery rates: 1.56 to 1.85 liter per second
per hectare (lps/ha)
Other Crops:
12-hour/day irrigation
Losses: Canals: 10%
Field: 30%
Overall efficiency: 60%
Peak canal delivery rates: 1.56 lps/ha



ANNEX 4
Page 6
Gross pumped water requirements would vary from 1.2 m/ha for irrigated crops
other than rice to 2.1 m/ha for rice.
17.       Ancillary Facilities (Full Development). One-lane gravel all-weather
roads would be located within the varzeas and rainfed areas so that all farms
would be not more than 1 km from such a road. Transmission lines would be
constructed from existing electrical networks near, or running through, the
varzeas. Building and shops for maintenance, repair and storage of equipment
would be constructed in the Betume area. Existing buildings in Penedo and
Marituba would be used for Marituba operations.
Cost Estimates
18.       Cost estimates for the Emergency Dikes and Pumping Stations are
presented in Table 1, while Tables 2 and 3 contain estimates for the Full
Development of the Marituba and Betume varzeas. Table 1 investment costs in-
clude 7% for engineering supervision during construction. Design costs for
the Emergency Works are not included, since those costs had been contracted
prior to appraisal. However, the estimates for Marituba and Betume include
allowances of 20% and 12.8%, respectively, for engineering design and super-
vision. The percentage is lower for Betume since detailed designs already
have been prepared for about 2,000 ha of the full development area.
Direct Costs Attributable to Paulo Alfonso-Sobradinho Hydroelectric
Power Project
19.       An estimate of the total direct costs of the damages due to the
changed river regime is presented in Table 5. Direct costs include invest-
ment costs for emergency works for all large and small varzeas, plus the
capitalized costs of operation and maintenance expenses, the costs of resettle-
ment and/or compensation of farmers who will be affected but which would not
be included in areas where facilities would be installed, and the capitalized
costs of fisheries losses in the lower river. The total amounf of US$25
million represents the approximate amount of direct costs which properly
should be charged to the Paulo Alfonso-Sobradinho Hydroelectric Power Project.
Equipment for Operation and Maintenance
20.       The project would include equipment for operation and maintenance
of the dikes, pumping stations, irrigation and drainage systems, and ancillary
works. Table 5 presents the detailed cost estimates for this initial out-
fitting. The equipment would be divided among three equipment centers: one
would be located near Propria; one at Penedo; and one in the Betume area.

BRAZIL
LOWER SAO FRANCISCO POLDERS PROJECT
Technical and Management Services, Agricultural
Research, and Seed Programs
Overall Project Administration and Operations
1.        The executing agency for the project, Companhia de Desenvolvimento
do Vale do Sao Francisco (CODEVASF), already has an existing regional office
at Propria which is actively engaged in completing the development of the
Propria and Itiuba varzeas (flood plains) and in managing other CODEVASF
activities in the Lower Sao Francisco River Valley. The regional office is
scheduled to be moved to the city of Aracaju, capital city of the State of
Sergipe, but the main field office for the Lower Valley and the proposed
project would remain at Propria. Additional personnel would be added to the
project offices as the needs develop. Because CODEVASF itself was in the
process of being completely reorganized at the time of appraisal, detailed
schedules of types and numbers of personnel needed had not been prepared.
Furthermore, for an indefinite period of time many of these persons would
be performing general CODEVASF duties, and not exclusively project duties.
It was recognized that the project would create some additional CODEVASF
overhead costs, but CODEVASF,has agreed that these costs for this first-
phase project would primarily be borne exclusively by CODEVASF. Exceptions
to this general rule would be made for the agricultural services to be
provided in the project varzeas. From an economic point of view, this is
justified on the basis of the "Emergency" nature of the project and the fact
that a major portion of the additional administrative costs are more properly
chargeable to the Paulo Afonso Project.
2.        Nevertheless, an overview of the overall management functions of
CODEVASF is pertinent. The project organization would have the following
major responsibilities:
Completion of design and construction (to be performed
primarily by consultants).
Acquisition of project lands.
Selection and resettlement of farmers.
Operation and maintenance of project facilities.
Distribution of irrigation water.



ANNEX 5

Collection of water charges.
Agricultural extension.
Agricultural research.
Seed production.
Organization and supervision of cooperatives.
This annex provides details on the last four functions listed.
3.        Present Agricultural Extension is at present provided in the Project
area by ANCAR 1/ in accordance with a covenant between CODEVASF and ABCAR 1/.
Two programs are in progress: PROVALE 1/ which is directed specifically to en-
couraging the use of irrigation, and SIERVALE 1/ which provides extension
services to crop and livestock producers. These programs, which were started
in 1972 and are due to continue until 1977, have been directed mainly to
medium-sized farmers who are assisted in preparing proposals for farm im-
provement and the installation of small irrigation projects with financing
by the banks and who are given technical assistance in carrying out their
programs.
4.        A total of 19 professionally qualified staff are engaged in the
two programs, of whom 13 were in Sergipe and six in Alagoas. The quality and
enthusiasm of the staff employed appeared to be very good. In addition to
the above CODEVASF has a locfl staff which includes 10 agronomists and two
veterinarians, who, among other duties, provide technical assistance to
farmers in the region. SUDAP 1/ employs three Agronomists, giving managerial
and technical assistance to the Cooperatives of Camurupim and Baixo Sao
Francisco.
Technical and Management Services
5.        Varzeas.  In order to cope with the new agricultural structure
introduced by the land reform program, a major shift in the services pro-
vided to the community is envisaged. Reorganization of extension services
would focus on the need to assist small rice farmers, especially in organi-
zational and marketing aspects, as well as to advise and monitor progress
in the technical aspects of rice and other crop production. A CODEVASF
Director of Agricultural Extension and Management Services would be appointed
to cover the whole of the project area, including the Propria and Itiuba
varzeas. An agricultural extension officer (Ingeniero Agronomo) would be

ANNEX 5

appointed for each of the two fully developed varzeas, who would have one
professional (university graduate) assistant and a number of agricultural
technicians (Tecnicos Agricolas--non-university graduates) serving as ex-
tension workers, depending upon the number of farmers involved. Farmers
would be grouped together in cooperating units of about 40, with one
farmer designated in each to help coordinate activities of his group with
the extension service. The farmer-coordinator would receive a small stipend.
Each extension worker would be responsible for up to six groups of farmers
and devote one day per week to each group. In this way each extension worker
would be responsible for about 240 farmers. In the varzeas in which only
emergency works are proposed, the extension services provided for this initial
phase 'would be much less intensive. These areas would be assigned to a team
of one professional agronomist and by one extension worker. In these varzeas,
one of the main functions of the service would be to organize filling and
emptying of the entire varzeas according to farmers' requirements and the
recommendations of the CODEVASF water control (irrigation) engineers.
6.        The experience and capabilities of the existing ANCAR extension
staff (paras 3 and 4) would be utilized through subcontracts by CODEVASF to
the maximum practicable extent. However, the primary role of CODEVASF for
management, coordination, and success of the project would require that most
of the varzea extension directors and the overall Director be CODEVASF
employees. Estimated costs of the varzea agricultural extension services
are given in Table 1.
7.        Tabuleiros.  A very important problem which is recognized by Govern-
ment, but-for which there is no immediate solution, is that the varzeas cannot
absorb all those who might wish to continue to farm. Desirable minimum family
rural incomes cannot be achieved unless plots of the size contemplated by the
project can be made available. Since these are about double the present size
of family farm plot, as many as half of the present farmers gradually would
have to be employed elsewhere. Large areas of the nearby tabuleiros lands
and transition slopes appear to be under-utilized. The project would therefore
include intensive evaluation of the potential of these types of lands as
future sources of feasible family-farm units. A pilot project would also be
established under the project in an already existing (but poorly performing)
cooperative area with about 1,000 ha of tabuleiros lands, located a short
distance from Penedo. Housing, roads, water supply and electricity are
already available. The results of this pilot project would provide important
facts which would be basic to the preparation of a second phase project em-
bracing all Lower Valley agricultural lands. Technical and management services
would be given to this area under arrangements similar to those hereinbefore
described for the varzeas, but these would be directed towards rainfed agri-
culture. Table 2 summarizes estimated costs of these services.
Cooperatives
8.        Membership in cooperatives would be obligatory for project bene-
ficiaries in the fully-developed varzeas. Cooperatives would provide the



ANNEX 5
Page 4
channel for provision of credit and farm inputs to their members, and also
would be responsible for marketing of production and for provision of
mechanized services initially, primarily plowing and harvesting. In the early
stages the Cooperatives would receive close guidance and supervision by staff
appointed by CODEVASF. As cooperative members are progressively able to
accept more responsibility, assistance from CODEVASF would be reduced. In-
dividual cooperatives would not be so large that members would be unable to
perform a useful function in governing their management. A limit of 400
members would result in the establishment of three or four cooperatives in
Betume and two to three in Marituba. With more than one cooperative in each
varzea, some competitiveness would be engendered, which should be beneficial.
Funds would be required for both working capital and procurement of machinery
for custom mechanized services, but have not been included as investment com-
ponents of the project because CODEVASF plans for the cooperatives were not
yet fully developed. Project costs would cover vehicles and salaries of
professional and technical personnel.
Agricultural Research
9.        A modest program of field experimentation undertaken by SUVALE 1/
has been in progress in the project area since 1968, mostly in the Marituba
pilot project area 2/. Main emphasis has been placed on the introduction,
testing and maintenance of purity of new varieties of rice, a crop which has
been grown in the region since 1590. The variety ESAV-36, introduced in ex-
periments in 1970, is now the most widely cultivated variety, together with
SML 4/67 which was introduced in 1968. Planting density. fertilizer require-
ments, and methods of pest and weed control have also been subjects for
experimentation. Limited attention has been paid to the cultivation of
other crops including corn, soybeans, and sorghum. The program is under the
direction of an experienced agronomist with a budget in 1974 of Cr$100,000
for labor and materials. With the Propria and Itiuba projects nearing
completion, and the varzeas of Betume and Marituba proposed to receive con-
trolled irrigation under the project, a considerably expanded experimental
program would be needed if full benefits are to be obtained from the invest-
ment made. The program for rice would be continued, with special attention
to new requirements arising as double cropping is progressively introduced,
while the inclusion of both irrigation and rainfed land on the combros and
on a pilot scale on the tabuleiros would require expansion of effort to
cover a wide range of field and fruit and vegetable crops. Professional
staff would be increased to five under a Director of Research and Seed Pro-
duction staff would be increased to five under a Director of Research and
Seed Production and would cover agronomy, farm management (farming systems),
plant/soil/water relationships and disease and pest control. An important
function of the research staff would be the training of extension workers

and progressive farmers in the different aspects of crop production, while
the farm management service would monitor the progress of project farmers.
The experimental farm in the Marituba pilot project area would be expanded
to cover some 15 to 20 ha of rice and combro land, and a new experimental
farm of 30 ha, of which 10 ha would be provided with irrigation, would be
established in the pilot area on the tabuleiros of Penedo (para 7). Housing,
equipment and transport would be provided under the project.
10.       In view of the rather specific needs of the project area, the
program, which would not involve basic research, primarily would be staffed
and financed by CODEVASF. Close liaison would be maintained with EMBRAPA, 1/
which would participate in the preparation of programs and the evaluation of
results, and coordinate the work with other stations in Brazil engaged in
similar fields of work. Specialized EMBRAPA staff would be made available
as required for consultation and advice. Laboratory services for soil and
other analysis would also be made available through EMBRAPA. Cost estimates
of the program may be found in Table 3.
Seed Production and Certification
11.       No area or state-wide organizations exist for the provision of good
quality seed. At present SUVALE produces and distributes some 40 tons of
rice seed per year from its 18-ha seed farm at Propria. Production from
this farm would continue under the project, and, in addition, CODEVASF would
contract with selected farmers to produce the quantities i certified seed
required by the project. An agronomist, assisted by four agricultural
technicians would be responsible for the seed production and certification
under the Director of Agricultural Research. Seed cleaning, drying and
testing equipment, with storage space and transport, would be provided through
the project. Investment costs of the project for supervisory staff, vehicles,
and equipment over a four-year period are projected in Table 4. Annual
operating costs would be covered by the sale of seed.
rainin g
12.       Specialized training of CODEVASF staff appointed to the project
would be provided through existing facilities. Financial provision would
be made for travel costs and allowances.
13.       Under a SUVALE/PIPMO 1/ ABCAR agreement, an important program of
training was carried out during 1973 and 1974. Ninety courses in 1973 were
attended by 1,700 persons and 31 courses in 1974 were attended by 2,700
persons. This program included courses for farmers covering all the important
crops plus livestock production, training of tractor drivers, machine operators
and mechanics. This program would be continued, with special attention to

training of farmers from the areas in which land redistribution and resettle-
ment would take place. Training courses for farmers, and refresher courses
for extension workers would be conducted at the present Training Center in
the Marituba Pilot area. The Center would be staffed by members of the Agri-
cultural Extension and Research services, which are included in the budgets
for those activities.

FISHERIES
A. Existing Situation
Fish Production
1.        Fish production in the Lower Sao Francisco River is derived primarily
from the beds of the main river and major tributaries during June through
October, and from temporarily flooded areas during January through June.  Most
of the shellfish are caught in the latter period. The fish catch from the
main river bed is estimated to be around 600 tons per year, or an average
productivity of about 20 kg per hectare from the 30,000 ha of generally per-
manently inundated areas extending from the coast to the rapids about 200 km
inland. Fish production is estimated to be about 550 tons per year from the
18,300 ha flooded for at least one to three months a year, or an average
productivity of 30 kg per ha of water surface area. Thus, total present
fish production is estimated to be about 1,150 tons annually from the Lower
Sao Francisco River, which represents the major portion of all freshwater
fish caught in the riparian states of Alagoas and Sergipe in 1971, as shown
by the following figures (tons):
Freshwater      Marine      Total
Alagoas                 571           2,002      2,573
Sergipe                 907           1,293      2,200
Total            1,478          3,295       4,773
Source:   SUDENE IBCE 1971.
Fish Consumption in Project Area
2.        The population along the Lower Sao Francisco River in 1970 was about
213,000. Therefore, if all 1,150 tons of the annual area catch were consumed
within the area, fish consumption per capita per year would be about 5.4 kg.
This can be compared to Brazil's 1970 overall consumption rate of about 6.6 kg
per capita, and that of Latin America's of about 6.5 kg per capita. (The two
countries with the highest per capita annual consumption rates are Portugal
and Japan; both more than 60 kg.)



ANNEX 6
Page 2
3.        Available data, however, are too limited to be conclusive as to the
real consumption rate in the area. For example, wholesale fish markets in
Penedo, Neopolis, and Piacabucu, three of the larger cities in the area,
reported sales of about 80 tons, 60 tons, and 54 tons per year in 1973,
respectively. Based on those figures, consumption per capita per year would
then have been: Penedo - 2.3 kg; Neopolis -- 3.6 kg; and Piacabucu -- 4.9
kg. Since these are substantially lower than the average area figure of
5.8 kg, it could mean that the average rural consumption in the area is
greater than in the cities, or that significant amounts of the catch are
delivered to places outside the area, or a combination of both.
4.        There is evidence to indicate that the rural consumption in the
area may indeed be higher than in the urban areas. Many farm families depend
on fish caught in the varzeas as a principal source of meat. Furthermore,
lack of refrigeration facilities limits transport and distribution of the
daily catch.
Principal Species of Fish
5.        Over 50 species of fish have been identified in the 200 km of the
Lower Sao Francisco River. Of these the more important from the standpoint
of fish consumption are:
Freshwater
Brazilian Name         Species                Equivalent English Name
Curimata             Prochilodus                    Unknown
Piau                 Leporinus, Schizodon           Unknown
Mandi                Pimelodus, Bagropsis           Catfish
Pira                 Conos tome                     Catfish
Limited to Area from Sea to Penedo
Manjuba              Anchoviella                    Anchovy
Tainha               Mugil                         Mullet
Bagre de Mar         Trchysurus                     Sea catfish
Pitu                 Macrobrachium                  Freshwater shrimp
6.        Little research has been done on the life history and living and
spawning habits of these fish, except for the Curimata pacu (Prochilodus
argentaus) and the Piau (Schizodon fisciatus) which Dr. Osmar Fontemel (DNOCS)
reported on. These two species migrate upstream to be near fast water in the



ANNEX 6
Page 3
rapids near Paulo Afonso or in the tributaries. Spawning areas have not been
located specifically, but it is known that spawning is triggered by the
coming of the annual floods, which usually occur in January and February.
One Curimata pacu female can spawn about one million eggs at a time. The
"'Spawn" (fry 1/ with yolk sack) absorb their sacks in about four days while
drifting downstreams. Fry require about 100 days to grow 5 to 10 cm in length.
It is estimated that fry could reach the lower areas within about 100 days.
While not much is known about the other species, it is generally accepted
that fish species that live in river systems having pronounced flood seasons
usually have their spawning habits influenced to some extent by the flood
water.
Fishermen
7.        It is estimated that there are about 700 full-time registered
fishermen, 3,000 registered part-time fishermen, 2,500 unregistered fishermen,
and 15,000 occasional fishermen in the Lower Sao Francisco River area, includ-
ing the varzeas. The usual fishing grounds for professional fishermen are
located in the main river bed, but during the flood season (January-June),
they also fish in the varzeas. The fishermen try to market all of their
catch, and many of the fish sold are not more than 5 to 8 cm in length.
Larger fish can weigh up to 60 kg, but the average size is relatively small.
Fresh water shrimp are caught by small traps in flooded areas and tributairies
all year-around.
Marketing, Processing and Prices
8.        Fish from the Sao Francisco River usually are sold fresh in both
the fish market and in the open town market places. Only a small amount is
salted and dried. The marketing system seems to be simple: some middlemen
purchase directly from the fishermen and fishermen colonia, while many
fishermen themselves deliver fish to the market. Fish prices in the Penedo
fish market in October 1974 averaged about Cr$8 to Cr$10 per kg for first
class major species such as Curimata, Mandi, Piau, and Pira, and about
Cr$3 to Cr$5 per kg for second and third class fish as Anchovy, small
Tilapia, and small fish.
Artificial Fish Culture
9.        Fish culture was started near Neopolis in 1965, and may have been
the first in Brazil of commercial size. It was begun with Tilapia and Carp,
mixed, on a 4-ha scale in a rice field, but the mix was a failure. The
species were then changed to Curimata pacu (80%), a benthos feeder, and
Mandi, an insect feeder, and Piau, omnivorous. This culture was successful
and the pond area was expanded to 40 ha. The harvest in 1972 was 17 tons
after a two-year fish-growth period, and production was estimated by the
owner to be about 30 tons in 1974, with harvest after 18 months of growth.
1/ Fry = young fish or small adult fish.



ANNEX 6
Page 4
10.       Several much smaller fish culture ponds are operating in the region,
but the method of culture seems to be that of natural conditions only. Tech-
nical or managerial advisory services are not readily available to the owners
and yields are reported to be relatively low.
Government Fisheries Activities in Region
11.       The Superintendency for the Development of Fishing, SUDEPE, has
organized fishermen's colonia and provided some financial support for improved
fish markets, schools, hospitals, doctors and assistance, but these efforts
have been limited primarily to saltwater fishermen. Superintendencia do
Desenvolvimento do Nordeste, SUDENE, has a Department for Natural Resources,
including fish resources, but it also seems to emphasize research on marine
fish resources surveys. Ministry of the Interior Departamento Nacional de
Obras Contra as Secas, DNOCS, has constructed numerous water reservoirs in
Northeast Brazil, many of which include fish production, but it presently
has only one experimental culture station, located in Fortaleza. DNOCS is
studying the freshwater culture of several species and reports some early
commercial success with a Tilapia hybrid. It has a Directorate of Fish and
Fish Culture, including a Centro do Pesquisas Ictiologicas, and four regional
offices. Companhia de Desenvolvimento do Vale do Sao Francisco, CODEVASF,
has an experimental laboratory for freshwater fish culture at Tres Marias
Reservoir in the Upper Sao Francisco Valley.
12.       Freshwater fish culture problems have been studied by many labora-
tories operated by various governmental organization, universities and
international agencies in Brazil. Unfortunately, very little practical field
work has been done by these institutions. Actual fish culture is conducted
at the present time only by private enterprises.
B. Effect on Lower Valley Fisheries Resources
by the Paulo Afonso and Emergency Projects
Effects of Paulo Afonso Complex
13.       Construction of Sobradinho dam and other regulating dams in the
Paulo Afonso area will affect the fisheries resources in the Lower Sao
Francisco Valley. Some of these effects can be quantified approximately,
some can be described only subjectively, while other can be identified in
terms of potential results.
14.       Sobradinho will decrease the frequency of flooding in the lower
valley. While there still will be floods almost every year, periods of as
long as four to five years could occur when all main stream flood crests
would be eliminated and only relatively low and regular monthly flows
released. Approximately 92% of the total drainage basin is upstream of the
Paulo Afonso complex, but floods from tributaries draining the remaining 8%



ANNEX 6
Page 5
would continue. Although the effects of these changed flooding conditions
on fish spawning are not predictable, the reduced extent of annual flooding
would reduce average annual fish production in those areas even if no
significant decrease in spawn were to occur. The average annual reduction
in flooded area will be about 3,000 to 4,000 ha, which represents a fish
production loss of about 90 to 120 tons per year (8% to 10% of present
production). Also, until re-regulating dams are constructed, daily fluctu-
ations of river levels in the lower valley of one to two meters are projected.
The effect of these fluctuations on fish production is unknown.
15.       When proposed dams at Xingo and Pao de Azucar are constructed, all
of the faster moving water in the Paulo Afonso Rapids section of the river
will be eliminated. This could decrease the available spawning grounds for
some important fish species, but further research into the fish habits and
related ecosystem are required before reasonable conjectures can be made on
this point.
16.       A possible benefit to fisheries resources of the main river would be
the increase in the minimum annual flow of the river from about 1,300 cms to
2,000 cms, following completion of the power complex. Again, further study
of the river ecosystem is required before the effect of this can be predicted
with any degree of certainty.
17.       Finally, it is noted that the construction of Sobradinho and the
Paulo Afonso complex is the reason for the proposed Emergency Project, which
is intended to preserve the agricultural production and livelihood of the
Lower Valley farmers. Such attempts, however, could have adverse effects
on fisheries resources unless offsetting actions are taken.
Effects of Emergency Project
18.       Reduction in fish production would be expected in the varzeas only
in drought years due to construction of emergency dikes and pumping plants
only. Gates would be provided to permit natural flood waters to flow into
the varzeas. While the gate areas are far less than the flow area under
natural conditions, it would be expected that sufficient eggs, fry, and
fingerlings would enter the varzeas to support fish production at about pre-
sent levels. During years when no floods occured, or only small ones, and
water had to be pumped into the varzeas, fish production would suffer, as
most of the small fish could not survive a journey through the pumps. An
additional annual decrease of fish production in such varzeas would also
result from the change in river regime (para 14).
19.       For those varzeas provided with full irrigation and drainage systems,
and protection against annual flooding, practically all natural fish production
would be eliminated, except in the drainage channels. The Marituba and
Betume varzeas would fall in this category with the first-phase project,
which would result in a loss of about 180 tons of fish production per year.



ANNEX 6

Fish Production Decrease, Initial Phase
20.       Considering only the effects mentioned in paragraphs 14 and 19,
the decrease in fish production which could be expected in the lower valley
because of the upstream power development and the withdrawal of the Marituba
and Betume varzeas from the annual flooding cycle, would amount to 270 to
300 tons per year, a decrease of about 25% of the present annual production
(1,150 tons). A major portion of this decrease would be expected to occur
in the catch of varzea residents who depend upon part-time fishing to provide
a significant amount of their protein supply.
C. Fisheries Program
21.       To offset any decrease in fish production in the Lower Valley, a
program for development of fish culture in artificial and natural ponds and
in rice fields would be initiated. The few artificial ponds in the area
now producing fish (paras 9 and 10) provide ample evidence that such culture
could be successful from both technical and commercial standpoints, if the
ingredients of technical and management advice, and credit, were more available.
22.       Before pond construction would begin, two other important parts of
the program would be implemented. First, a Detailed Study would be conducted
during the first year. This would include a study of the lower river ecosystem,
with identification and description of spawning grounds and habits of major
fish species; location, sizes, and numbers of future Fry Collection Centers
and a future Central Hatchery; potential locations of artificial ponds, natural
pools, and rice field drainage ponds; schematic designs and cost estimates;
and recommendations for a specific program of development for commercial and
non-commercial fishpond culture. Second, following adoption of Program and
Plan of Action by CODEVASF, Fry Collection Centers and a series of demonstr-
ation ponds would be established in all of the major varzeas.
Directly Productive Components
23.       Artificial Ponds.  Basic elements for fish production would be
artificial ponds. Each would be from 1 to 10 ha in surface area, with a
depth of about 1 meter, and stocked with relatively fast-growing native fish
species such as Curimata pacu and Piau. Ponds would be harvested every 18
months, and, from the third harvest onward, could be expected to yield about
1 ton/ha. Some 150 ha of artifical ponds would be constructed during the
four-year program and would produce 300 tons of fish over a three-year period,
or an average annual yield of about 100 tons/year.
24.       Natural Ponds.  In most of the varzeas, there are natural depressions
which form ponds for several months following floods and the rainy season.
Under the project, about 60 ha in total surface area of natural ponds, with
individual ponds being about 1 to 10 ha in surface area, would be stocked



ANNEX 6
Page 7
with fast-growing hydrid Tilapia fish. Harvest would be after five or six
months, with an expected yield of about 800 kg/ha. The 60 ha of these ponds
then would produce about 48 tons of fish annually.
25.       Rice Field Drainage Ponds.  Additional fish production would come
from small ponds of about 0.5 ha in size, located near the drainage outlets
of groups of rice fields, which would utilize the drainage water from the
fields. Hybrid Tilapia would be cultivated, with harvests and yields being
about the same as in the natural ponds. Some 60 ha of such ponds would be
included in the first-phase project, which would produce about 48 tons of
fish annually.
26.       Total production from the three types of ponds to be included in
the project would average about 196 tons/year, which would offset about
two-thirds of the expected decrease in Lower Valley fish production (para
20). The remaining one-third would be recovered during a second phase
expansion of the program, which also would provide for any decrease caused
by diking of other varzeas. Once the commercial feasibility of these types
of ponds are demonstrated in all of the varzeas, a rapid increase in their
number could be expected. In view of the limited practical experience in
the area of fisheries experts and technologists who might provides some
guidance to the individual farmers and cooperatives interested in fisheries,
the proposed program has been tailored to accomplish what is believed to be
achievable within the project period. Time also is required to complete
more studies of the types of fish which are most adaptable and to develop
recommendations for operations from the results of applied research in
demonstration ponds and hatcheries.
Indirectly Productive Components
27.       By the end of the fourth program year, nearly 40 tons of fry and
fingerlings would be required annually to stock ponds in the area. These
would be obtained from several Fry Collection Centers and a Central Hatchery.
28.       Fry Collection Centers.  These would be located near the spawning
areas of major native fish species believed adaptable to cultivation in ponds.
About 15 ha of total pond area would be required for the Centers. Fry would
be collected by residents living nearby and delivered to the Centers. Where
they would be kept in retention ponds until transfer to the Hatchery or until
they reached the proper growth stage for planting in ponds.
29.       Hatchery.  This facility would be constructed to conduct research
on the adaptability of native and new fish species for use in pond culture.
An area of about 40 ha would be needed. It also would serve as the primary
source of hybrid Tilapia fingerlings. These would be monosex fish, which
would not reproduce in the ponds. Hence each pond would have only one age
group, thus enhancing yields and facilitating harvesting.



ANNEX 6
Page 8
30.       Demonstration Ponds.  About 25 Demonstration Ponds, each about 2
ha in size, would be built in the area to demonstrate to farmers that such
ponds could be operated successfully on a commercial basis. These would not
be for research, although the operational experiences of these ponds certainly
would be used to develop recommendations for commercial fish farmers.
Production Parameters
31.       Pond operations would be based on natural feeding.  A mixture of
native fish species would be used in the artificial ponds, including plankton
feeders, algae feeders, insect feeders, and benthos feeders. The primary
food under these conditions would be plankton, to be nourished by organic
fertilizers such as cow manure, green leaves, chopped rice straw, and
sugarcane and rice bran waters. About 2 tons of cow manure per hectare
would support the production of around 1 ton of fish per hectare, depending
upon soil and water conditions. For the natural ponds, selected Tilapia
hybrid species would be used.
32.       The fingerlings, depending upon their size, would be released into
a small nursery pond within the larger pond, or directly into the larger pond.
Growth rates vary with fish species. The native Curimata pacu species grows
from 60 grams to about 1,000 grams and the native Piau from 60 grams to about
700 grams, in from 14 to 18 months.  Tilapia hybrids grow more rapidly to
marketable size, reaching 150 grams in weight from 20 grams in from five to
six months.  Estimated stocking and yield rates are summarized in the following
table:
Native Fish - Fingerlings = 60 g each; adults = 700 g to 1,000 g each.
Stocking              Yield
First Harvest               800 fish/ha = 48 kg/ha           500 kg/ha
Second Harvest            1,200 fish/ha = 72 kg/ha          700 kg/ha
Third Harvest             1,600 fish/ha = 96 kg/ha        1,000 kg/ha
18 months to harvest; two harvest in three years
Tilapia Hybrid - Fingerlings - 20 g each; adults = 150 g each.
6,000 fish/ha = 120 kg/ha         800 kg/ha
5-6 months to harvest; one harvest/year
Operations
33.       While the ultimate objective would be for all ponds to be privately
owned and operated by individuals, cooperatives, or companies, in this first



ANNEX 6
Page 9
phase of development CODEVASF would own the ponds. It would construct
artificial ponds, improve natural ponds, and operate demonstration ponds.
It would either operate or lease the production ponds.
Labor Requirements
34.       Ponds would be constructed primarily by manual labor.  Manpower
requirements would be approximately as follows:

Cost and Projected Revenues
35.       Financial projections for a 10-ha commercial fish farm, a 10-ha
natural pond, and a 0.5-ha rice field drainage pond are presented in Tables
1 through 4. The costs assume construction by contract, with the contractor
paying the minimum wage, plus 80% social benefits to the workers. Cash costs
would be greatly reduced for construction by using contributed labor supplied
by cooperatives or farmers. Excellent financial and economic rates of return
are indicated.
Overall Program Costs and Production
36.       Tables 5, 6 and 7 summarize estimated program production, revenues,
and costs. CODEVASF adminsitrative overhead costs, which the project would
assist in financing for the first four years (the duration of this project),
are shown in Table 6. The indicated overhead costs are properly only partially
chargeable to the initial program, since they include all the costs of startup
and applied research for a program which could be expanded, even into other
areas of NE Brazil.
37.       Terms of Reference for the Detailed Study are given in Annex 12.



ANNEX 6
Page 10
Use of Agricultural Chemicals
38.       Increased use of organic and chemical fertilizers in the va,rzeas
would generally enhance fish production where field drainage waters feed
fish ponds. However, the use of pesticides and herbicides in the area would
need to be controlled to avoid harmful concentrations of these agricultural
chemicals in pond waters. Efforts would be made by CODEVASF and State
Agricultural Departments to limit the use of such chemicals to those that
would not be harmful (there are such, but their present availability in
Brazil is unknown) or if harmful, to limit their use to places, times and/or
concentrations which would not adversely affect fish production.
Additional Activities
39.       While the proposed pond development program to be included in the
project would replace a major portion of the estimated initial losses in
fish production due to the expected changes in lower river regime, expansion
of the program would be required to offset the remaining initial losses as
well as the additional losses expected after full development of other
varzeas and to help assure the availability of fish to the rural population.
The results of the proposed program would provide an improved basis for
planning and implementing additional activities in this area of interest.
40.       Increased fish production from the main river could be expected
if local commercial fishermen could have credit facilities available to
them for the purchase of improved gear. The benefits of the national SUDEPE
program, which could provide this help, has not yet been extended to the
Lower Sao Francisco area, but CODEVASF would make efforts to bring such
benefits to the area.

BRAZIL
LOWER SAO FRANCISCO POLDERS PROJECT
Infrastructure
A. Transportation
Navigation
1.        The Sao Francisco river is navigable the year round for small boats
from the river mouth up to Piranhas 210 km inland, and small ships can travel
to Pao de Acucar, 170 km inland, during periods of high trade. River traffic
is composed primarily of fishing and local navigation from one side to the
other, mainly in sailboats. A large sandbank at the river mouth and the lack
of adequate port facilities in the cities on the river border, prevent a
significant increase in river navigation. A ferry service exists between
Penedo and Neopolis for transporting cars, passengers and cargo.
Railways
2.        A railway runs northward through the area from one state capital
(Aracaju in Sergipe) to the other (Maceio in Alagoas), crossing the river at
Propria/Porto Real do Colegio. It provides linkage also to the rest of the
country. This railway handles around 500,000 tons of merchandise and several
thousand passengers each year.
Airports
3.        The only airport in the Lower Sao Francisco Valley is near Penedo
and consists of a well-maintained dirt strip for light aircraft. It is super-
vised by Companhia de Desenvolvimento do Vale do Sao Francisco (CODEVASF).
The closest airport for jets is in Aracaju, Sergipe (250 km distant).
Roads
4.        The road system in the Lower Sao Francisco Valley consists of fed-
eral, state and municipal roads, and small feeder roads to farms. Federal
roads have asphaltic concrete surfaces, the state roads have all-weather gravel
surfaces, and the municipal roads have dirt surfaces.  The federal roads are -_
in good condition and the state roads in fair condition. The municipal roads
need major improvements in extent of system and in maintenance.
5.        Funds for road construction and maintenance are mostly derived from
the national tax on motor vehicle fuels. The National Highway Department
(DNER) receives around 40% of these funds, the State Highway Departments re-
ceive around 32% and the municipalities around 8%. The municipalities re-



ANNEX 7
Page 2
ceive funds based upon a formula that combines past fuel consumption, popula-
tion and area. This tends to discriminate against small municipalities, who,
by not having many roads, lack qualifications for receiving funds.
6.        Most of the good roads in the area run in directions generally to-
wards the river. The few roads running parallel to the river are in poor
condition and are unusable during the flood season. The project flood pro-
tection works would provide the basis for a major breakthrough in road com-
munication. New roads, which would, in part, be built behind the projected
dikes alongside the Sao Francisco River, would considerably shorten the
distance between the agricultural areas and villages.
Project Feeder Roads
7.        In order to facilitate the transport flow in and out of the varzeas
(flood plains), particularly for bringing agricultural products to the mar-
kets and distribution centers, some new roads would be constructed and several
existing roads would be upgraded. These roads would link areas which are now
relatively isolated from the main federal and state roads, and would play a
fundamental role in expanding the economic and social activities of those
areas. The project would include a total of about 60 km of upgraded roads
and 34 km of new roads, together with necessary small bridges and culverts.
Roads would have all-weather gravel surfaces, with a 5.5-m- wide platform.
Representative costs for 1 km of new project roads are shown in Table 1. Total
estimated cost would be US$850,000. Final selection of feeder roads to be
included in the project would be made by CODEVASF in consultation with local
governments involved, so that needs are met and maintenance assured. The
Government would submit feasibility studies to the Bank justifying the selec-
tion of the specific roads to be included prior to the commencement of con-
struction of each road.
B. Communications
8.        Existing area communications facilities include telephone, telegraph,
telex, radio, television, postal, press and microwave services. The level of
service is very low.
Telephone
9.        Most major cities have a telephone system and smaller communities
often have a public service telephone center. The telephone density in the
Lower Valley is very low--around 2 per 1,000 population (1970 figure), com-
pared to 20 per 1,000 population for all of Brazil during the same year.
Furthermore, the existing telephone service needs much improvement.



ANNEX 7

Telegram and Telex
10.       Although telegraph services are readily available, telegram deli-
veries are reported to be slow. The main transmittal method is by Morse code
and, less frequently, teletype. Telex is not used in the area.
Radio and Television
11.       The only radio station in the Lower Valley is a medium-wave station
located in Penedo, with a low power output of 500 watts. Several radio sta-
tions outside of the area can be received clearly. Some estimates indicate
that nearly half the people have access to a radio receiver in their home.
Some radio broadcasts are given for educational, health, sanitation, agri-
cultural, weather, political and cultural purposes, but this could be greatly
expanded. The only television reception is from stations outside the region
and it is very weak.
C. Electricity
12.       Per capita electric energy consumption in the municipalities of the
Lower Sao Francisco Valley within the State of Alagoas and Sergipe was esti-
mated to be only 63 and 84 kwh, respectively, for these states in 1973 (the
State of Sao Paulo, in comparison, used over 1,000 kwh per capita), but it
is rapidly increasing. The existing electricity distribution network (medium
and low tension) in the Lower Sao Francisco Valley serves most towns with more
than 1,000 inhabitants. The primary transmission line of 69 KV goes to Pro-
pria, Porto Real do Colegio, and Penedo, and 13.8-KV lines connect the main
towns to the electricity net. Service voltage is 380 and 220 in urban areas
and 440 and 220 in rural areas, at 60 cycles.
13.       The project would include US$200,000 for electrical transmission
lines and distribution networks for a few rural villages, each having more
than 500 inhabitants and serving a total population of about 5,000 persons.
Priority would be given to villages in the Marituba and Betume varzeas, es-
pecially new ones established for resettled farmers. Some public lighting
for the main road in each village would be included. CODEVASF would coordi-
nate, encourage and help finance activities of agencies involved in elec-
tricity through operational agreements with these agencies. Villagers who
wish their houses connected to the electricity system would have to pay the
connection costs involved.  Prevailing electricity tariffs would be applied
by the local electricity authority, CEAL in the State of Alagoas and ENERGIPE
in the State of Sergipe. These authorities would also be responsible for
operation and maintenance of the systems. Representative costs for a typical
village with about 1,000 residents are shown in Table 2.
14.       For other than new villages created for project settlers, electri-
city facilities would not be constructed unless the residents agreed to con-
tribute at least 20% of the capital costs, in cash and/or kind, and to pay



ANNEX 7
Page 4
all O&M costs or prevailing tariffs for these services. Any new villages
which would be required to provide homes for project settlers would have
these installed without capital contributions required from the settlers,
but the residents would have to pay all O&M costs or prevailing tariffs. A
further limitation would be that the initial investment cost per capita would
not exceed US$60.
D. Village Water Supply
15.       Only a few major towns in the area have piped water systems.  Most
of the water used for domestic purposes in the Lower Valley is obtained from
the Sao Francisco River and its tributaries. Other sources are wells and
rainwater tanks. In general, the chemical water quality of the various
sources is acceptable.
16.       The project would include basic water supply systems for a few area
villages with populations of from 500 to 1,000. Priority would be given to
villages in the Marituba and Betume varzeas, especially those developed for
resettled farmers. Some US$150,000 would be allocated, which would provide this
service to around 4,000 persons.
17.       The distribution systems in the villages would be simple, serving
community hydrants located at suitable points along village streets. If
villages would be willing and able to pay for house connections, they would
be provided. Water supply would be either from surface streams, in which
case a basic filtration and chlorination system would be installed, or from
wells, which would require chlorination only. The supply from a well would
generally be less complicated to operate, and would be preferred. Representative
costs for such a system for a village of 500 residents are given in Table 3.
18.       Capital cost contributions of 20% from other than new villages would
be required, following criteria similar to that set forth in paragraph 14 for
village electricity systems. Al O&M costs would have to be paid by the vil-
lages. A limitation of US$50 per capita would apply to the initial system
cost. CODEVASF would provide technical and administrative assistance to vil-
lages in the absence of such assistance from local entities for the establi-
shment and operation of administrative and operating organizations for the
village systems.
E. Waste Disposal and Sewerage
19.       Waste disposal and sewerage are in a primitive stage in the total
Lower Sao Francisco Valley. Waste is usually buried or dumped in a garbage
area outside the town or city and these areas are potential sources of dis-
eases. In the case of sewerage, state authorities only recently have started
to build sewerage systems in the major cities. In the rural areas, the situa-
tion is much worse. Villagers usually do not have even septic tanks, and rely
on very rudimentary systems, or no systems. Fundacao Servico Especial de Saude



ANNEX 7
Page 5
Publica (FSESP), the most active health organization in the area, is building
small wooden sanitary houses which it sells or gives to the villagers (depend-
ing upon their buying power). It then gives directions to the villagers on
how to dig and maintain the septic tank that is needed for this sanitary
house. In an effort to remedy the adverse effects (internal parasites and
such) that bad sanitary conditions can create, FSESP also is helping to in-
stall concrete slabs with a squat-type hole in household privies. These
concrete slabs are relatively inexpensive (US$5), easy to make, and they
effectively combat the internal parasite cycle. The health component of the
project would include US$30,000 to aid FSESP in this program (para 35). In
a second phase project, some cities or towns could be selected to have sewerage
and sewerage treatment systems.
F. Education
20.       The educational system in Northeast Brazil is hampered by an acute
shortage of human, physical and financial resources. The educational system
and some of the general education problems are discussed in the Brazil "Second
Education Project" Appraisal Report. The problems mentioned there are even
worse, in some aspects, in the Lower Sao Francisco Valley. While education
in the Lower Sao Francisco Valley can be expected to improve as a result of
the Government's nationwide stress on education, it is presently at a low level
compared to the national average. Illiteracy is as high as 60%, and the
majority of the labor force has less than one year of schooling. The educa-
tional situation on the Sergipe side of the project area is slightly better
than on the Alagoas side, but both states share the same general problems.
Facilities
21.       The majority of the schools have only one room, which results in a
heterogeneous classroom. Many schools in the rural areas are little more than
sheds. Although the free primary education in Brazil has recently been ex-
tended to cover grades 1 to 8, most schools in the project area give only basic
education for grades 1 to 4. Classes are given in two shifts or more. Secondary
schooling and higher education facilities are available only in the two cities,
Penedo (Alagoas) and Propria (Sergipe). There are federal, state, municipal and
private schools, with state and municipal schools having the most significant
role in basic education. At the higher levels, private schools have the great-
est portion of enrollment. Formal education in schools is often out-of-step
with existing employment opportunities and is not designed for rural people.
The equipment and teaching/learning material leave much to be desired, since
they are in short supply and often in a poor state of repair. A serious pro-
blem is the lack of budgetary support from the Government for the operation
and maintenance of existing facilities. Supplementing the work of the formal
educational institutions are a number of private and Government auxiliary
training programs. These cover a variety of skills as well as providing li-
teracy education.



ANNEX 7
Page 6
Staffing
22.       Teacher quality also leaves much to be desired.  Many do not have
teaching certificates, particularly in the municipal schools, and there is a
lack of trained administrative and supporting staff. Pay scales are low.
Students
23.       Children do not begin school at an uniform age.  Because of this,
together with the high repetition rate, students of varying ages are found in
each grade. Over-age students occupy more than a third of total student places
in the first four grades, and two-thirds of those in grades 5 to 8. While the
first grade is typically overcrowded, the number of students diminishes in the
higher grades because of the high dropout rate. The number of students grad-
uating therefore is low, especially males, which no doubt stems from the con-
tinued requirement for them to provide farm labor or to contribute to family
income. The percentage of children in the normal school age group enrolled
in regular courses is also low. The Brazilian Government has recognized
these problems and is taking measures to reduce the incidence of repeaters
and dropouts, but this will take time.
Project Facilities
24.       Formal Education.  The project would provide for expanding and
improving the educational facilities in the Marituba and Betume varzeas by
providing classrooms for basic education of grades 1 to 4. Most of these
would serve 80 students on a two-shift basis (one classroom per 95 to 100
families). Also, some classrooms for grades 5 to 8 are needed in order to
enable students coming for lower grades to continue their primary education.
WJorkshops would be constructed in which more emphasis would be placed on
practical subjects such as agriculture and carpentry, to better prepare
students for existing labor opportunities. The exact size and location of
the schools and workshops would be determined by CODEVASF and the educational
institutions in the region. Necessary equipment and materials for these
schools and workshops would also be provided. The classrooms would be
designed for use outside school hours by other community groups and organi-
zations for literacy courses and adult skill training programs. The total
amount set aside for new schools and workshops would be US$100,000. Also,
an additional sum of US$50,000 would be included in the project to improve
some existing schools and to supply them with necessary materials and equip-
ment. Table 4 presents representative costs of a one-classroom building.
Costs of buildings with more than one classroom would be less per classroom.
Schools and workshops would be built only in locations in which the needed
professionals, other personnel, and operating funds are assured.
25.       Vocational Education.  More intense use should be made of farmer
training centers, functional literacy programs, mobile training units, in-
dustrial and commercial training schemes, accelerated vocational training
centers and educational programs by radio to improve the level of the economi-
cally active population. A sum of US$100,000 would be included in the project
for vocational education, which would be selectively invested by CODEVASF, in



ANNEX 7
Page 7
consultation with the Bank, in programs of agencies involved in vocational
education with which it has operational agreements.
26.       Second-Phase Project.  A possible second phase, in which the larger
educational aspects of the project Lower Valley would be combined in part
with state educational programs would be studied as part of the Master Plan
and Feasibility Study which would be financed by the proposed loan.
G. Health
Present Situation
27.       The overall level of health of the population in the Lower Sao
Francisco Valley is low, as evidenced by the high infant mortality index (15%),
low life expectancy, and high incidence of various diseases. Beyond the
socio-economic and cultural conditions of the majority of the population
(illiteracy, taboos, low income), which undoubtedly contribute towards the
low health condition, the main causes in the area are inadequate basic sani-
tation and water supply conditions, and the limited degree of medical-sanitary
and hospital help available. Additionally, intestinal parasites, infectious
diseases, and malnutrition contribute significantly to the low health conditions
and low productivity of the population.
28.       With the exception of the three cities of Propria (18,500 population),
Penedo (23,500 population), and Neopolis (7,300 population), there is a gene-
ral lack of medical services. These cities possess the only hospitals (260
total beds), maternity stations, and tuberculosis stations in a service area
which contains more than 150,000 people. Of the 35 doctors in the area, 29
are located in these three cities. Furthermore, the patients treated are mostly
those in the urban and higher income classifications. All municipality seats,
however, do have a health post, often with a resident doctor.
29.       The principal endemic diseases reported include helmintosis, gastro-
enteritis, and other diarrheal ailments and are largely due to inadequate
domestic sanitation conditions.  Communicable diseases reported in the area
include tuberculosis and V.D. Schistosomiasis is common in several of the
varzeas. Malaria is nresent, but is fairlv-well controlled.
30.       Available auxiliary personnel are insufficient in number and poorly
trained. Qualified nursing personnel are nearly non-existent except in the
cities of Penedo and Propria. The non-institutional sector, however, is rich
in such human resources as midwives, faith healers, and practical dentists.
31.       Treatment of patients is mostly free, with the more well-to-do patients
paying part of their costs according to their income. Various vaccination pro-
grams are underway, but exclusively in urban areas. Rural people who are sick
must travel to the health post in the municipality seat to be treated.



ANNEX 7
Page 8
Possible Steps for Improvement
32.       The following steps for improvement of area health could be considered
for the future.
(a) Programs to combat malnutrition should be implemented. Nutrition
education and distribution of food as schools should be expanded.
Special attention should be given to preschool children as they
are the most vulnerable group. Better nutrition would reduce
susceptibility to infection and diminish the severity of illness;
(b) Special care should be given to pregnant mothers and infants to
bring down the high infant mortality;
(c) Doctors should be given extra incentives to keep them in the
rural areas;
(d) Health agencies should intensify the start already made
with audio visual health education programs in schools;
(e) The rural population should be reached more with mobile
units for curative and preventive treatment and with
pamphlets, lectures and radio programs designed to dis-
seminate basic information on health and sanitary condi-
tions;
(f) Rural health workers selected from farm families could be
trained locally to perform first aid, give vaccinations,
provide aid at child birth, and dispense medicines; and
(g) CODEVASF could play an important role in coordinating the
workings of the various participating health organizations
in order to integrate them into a unified effort.
Health Components Included in the Project
33.       Endemic diseases such as malaria and schistosomiasis are still spora-
dically present in the project area. The project would therefore provide
US$35,000 for CODEVASF, together with the different health institutions in-
volved (Superintendencia de Campanhas (SUCMI), and Fundacao Servico Especial
de Saude Publica (FSESP), to monitor the project area and take necessary pre-
ventive action to control and cut back these diseases.
34.       Most of the sicknesses in the Lower Sao Francisco Valley are caused
by internal parasites, prevailing because of the poor sanitation conditions.
The PSESP program for installing concrete slabs with a squat type hole in
household privies effectively combats the internal parasite cycle (para. 19).
The project would therefore provide US$30,000 to aid FSESP in administrative
and material costs for this effective program.



ANNEX 7
Page 9
35.       The project also would include the construction of a health post in
Marituba, staffed by a doctor, a nurse and five auxiliary personnel, and a
dispensary in Betume, with two auxiliary personnel, at an estimated total cost
of US$45,000, including materials and equipment (Table 5). Construction,
operation and maintenance would be carried out in coordination with the health
agencies involved (most probably FSESP, with which CODEVASF has a working
agreement), with financial assistance from CODEVASF. The facilities would not
be constructed until assurances were obtained that the needed professionals,
other personnel, and operating funds would be available.
36.       A more comprehensive health program would be suggested for the
project areas as part of the Master Plan and Feasibility study which would be
financed by the project.

LOWER SAO FRANCISCO POLDERS PROJECT
Studies, Surveys and Plans
Master Plan and Feasibility Study
1.        In the Fall of 1974 Government consultants (Consortium SCET Inter-
national (France) - SIRAC (Brazil)) completed a comprehensive preliminary
study and Master Plan (Plan Diretor) for the development of 270,000 ha which
had been selected as having the best potential for agricultural development
out of the 1.3 million-ha Lower Sao Francisco Valley area. It is a large
report, comprised of several volumes containing great amounts of information,
including preliminary feasibility analyses for potential agro-industries and
estimates of needed supporting infrastructure for the study area. However,
the report does not propose a specific "project" which would be suitable for
Bank appraisal, nor does it contain all the details necessary to prepare an
integrated rural development plan for the area. The Emergency Project which
is the subject of this appraisal would include, therefore funds for preparation
of a Feasibility Report for an Integrated Rural Development Project for the
Lower Sao Francisco Valley. Vital parts of such a project would be the
completion of full development work in the four varzeas not slated for such
work in the first phase, and the resettlement of excess farm population on
nearly tabuleiros lands, or elsewhere.
2.        The existing Master Plan would serve as the starting point for the
new Feasibility Study, which would be prepared under the direction of CODEVASF,
probably by consultants, but with the guidance of the IBRD/FAO CP, which has
been associated closely with the formulation of the Emergency Project. The
Bank would provide advice to all concerned, as appropriate, to help assure that
the resultant report would present a project ready for Bank appraisal.
3.        The study and Feasibility Report would be concentrated on the
270,000 ha area already identified and would include, among other things,
the following:
(a) Plans for the acquisition, redistribution, and full
development of the remaining varzea lands in the Lower
Valley.
(b) Plans for the full utilization of other arable lands in
the area (i.e., tabuleiros, combros, and slopes).
(c) Plans for the resettlement, alternative employment, or
other satisfactory disposition of excess farm families
(i.e., present farmers for whom no farm lands would be
available after agrarian reform).



ANNEX 8
Page 2
(d) Identification of, and detailed feasibility studies for,
key agro-industries necessary for the processing and
marketing of area agricultural production.
(e) Incremental agricultural credit needs.
(f) Incremental requirements for working capital organization
and management, and machinery for farm cooperatives.
(g) Incremental needs for agricultural extension and processing
facilities.
(h) Plans for all feeder and other roads necessary for full
development.
(i) Plans to meet rural needs for social infrastructure
components such as electricity, water supply, sanitation,
health, schools, and community centers. Such plans
would include financial and operation and maintenance
plans.
(j) Plans for the recovery of project costs from beneficiaries,
in accordance with Government and Bank requirements.
4.        The studies would be completed during calendar 1976 and 1977 and
submitted to the Bank for review late in 1977, with the objective of obtaining
a Bank loan before the end of calendar 1978, so that the new project can
begin as the first-phase project is completed. Total estimated cost for the
study and report is US$460,000.
Engineering Surveys and Designs
5.        This portion of the project covers all work necessary to complete
the surveys and final designs for full development of the four varzeas which
would have only emergency works constructed during this first phase (Boacica,
Brejo Grande, Continguiba and Pindoba). The work would include:
(a) Topographic and agricultural soil surveys.
(b) Foundation testing.
(c) Final design drawings.
(d) Detailed cost estimates, including estimates of skilled and
unskilled manpower needs, and foreign exchange requirements.
The labor, equipment, and material components of the costs
would be shown for major work categories.
(e) Preparation of Tender documents and draft contracts.



ANNEX 8
Page 3
6.        The estimated cost for this work is US$1,980,000.
Detailed Studies and Plans for Fisheries Program
7.        Implementation of the fisheries program would be preceded by a
Detailed Study which would require from six to nine months to complete. Pri-
mary objectives of the study would be to identify potential sites for the fry
collection centers, hatchery, and the demonstration ponds; to prepare schematic
designs and cost estimates; to recommend the types of fish to be cultivated
initially; and to present recommendations for a specific program of development
for commercial and non-commercial fish pond culture in the Lower Sao Francisco
Region. More specifically, the study would include the following:
(a) Study of the Lower River ecosystem, especially to ascertain
the spawning habits and spawning grounds of major river food
fishes which would be adaptable for pond culture, but also
to establish (at a reconnaissance level) whether or not
the construction of upstream dams and facilities will unduly
interfere with the reproductive cycle and spawning and migration
habits of the principal food fishes. If it is determined that
the Paulo Alfonso facilities would cause such interference,
the magnitude of the effects on fisheries resources would be
estimated, and the feasibility of utilizing fishladders and
related devices at the dams would be established.
(b) Estimates of annual fish catch, by species, in the lower
river, varzeas, and marsh lands.
(c) Studies of disposition of local catch and pattern of fish
consumption in the area, for both urban and rural population.
(d) Identification of areas where soil and water conditions
would be suitable for fish culture, including marsh lands.
(e) Identification of suitable locations for fry collection
centers, a central hatchery, demonstration ponds, and natural
and artificial ponds, and ricefield drainage ponds
adaptable for fish culture.
(f) Dimensions, characteristics, equipment, and material needed
for various types of feasible fish ponds.
(g) Recommendations for types of fish to be cultured, including
consideration of both native and potentially adaptable species
and hybrid tilapia.
(h) Suggested pond operating procedures and material and manpower
requirements, especially noting the feasibility of using
natural fertilizers and the need or desirability of additional
artificial feeding.

(i) Detailed estimates of investment and operating costs for
demonstration, artificial, natural and ricefield drainage ponds.
(j) Economic and financial feasibility studies for various
alternatives for fish pond culture in ponds and nearby marsh
lands.
(k) Presentation of a recommended plan of fish pond culture
development, with a yearly schedule, and with special emphasis
on the four-year phase project period.
(1) Recommendations for CODEVASF and/or other Government
organization, staffing, equipment, and material requirements,
to oversee and execute the program.
(m) Recommendations for financing of the recommended plan, including
consideration of some operations by individual farmers and
cooperatives.
8.        The estimated cost of the Study and Report is US$100,000.
Cadastral Surveys
9.        Under this project component, cadastral surveys would be completed,
first in the two varzeas slated for full development during this project and
then in the main portions of the other four varzeas and the small varzeas
which would be developed fully in a subsequent phase.  Existing land ownerships
would be determined and confirmed, using both written records and field
surveys. The costs for this component of the project would be about US$650,000.

LOWER SAO FRANCISCO POLDERS PROJECT
Monitoring
1.        The land redistribution aspects of the project, although embracing in
this initial phase only 9,000 ha of a larger area targeted for similar treat-
ment later, represent a significant new step by Brazil in its efforts to
alleviate poverty and raise standards of living among the rural poor of North-
east Brazil. The Bank too has great interest in the degree of success attained
in achieving the objectives for the Emergency Project set forth in the Paulo
Afonso Project loan agreement (1008-BR), to the effect that the benefits should
"...be shared equitably by land holders, sharecroppers, and laborers in the
area...."  In addition the problems encountered and the results achieved in
implementing several other portions of the project, such as social infrastruc-
ture, agricultural extension, and farmer cooperatives, need to be clearly
identified and quantified, so that they can provide an improved basis for
the planning of future rural development projects in Northeast Brazil.
2.        The Government and the Bank are in agreement that the importance of
obtaining this information on a continuing basis from inception would require
the establishment of a small special unit (Unit) to monitor the project. It
would be essential that the Unit maintain an impartial attitude toward the
project, and that it be given access to all pertinent data. For that reason
it would be established outside the executing agency, the Corporation for the
Development of the Sao Francisco Valley (CODEVASF), perhaps directly under the
Ministry of the Interior (MINTER) or the Superintendency for the Development
of the Northeast (SUDENE). The services of consultants from within the
country, and perhaps from outside Brazil, also probably would be required.
The Unit would be staffed, at least part-time, with an economist, an anthro-
pologist or sociologist, and technical personnel, as necessary. The Unit
would need to have a close relationship with the Bank from the beginning of
the project. The Government is in agreement with this concept.
3.        Monitoring would be concentrated on the full development of the
Marituba and Betume varzeas and in the Tabuleiros pilot area. Two crucial
items of study would be the increases in production on irrigated and rainfed
lands, and the changes in income of farmers in these areas. A principal
objective of the monitoring would be to accurately record these changes and
the costs involved, and to compare them with those anticipated at the time
of appraisal. This would involve some type of sampling technique being applied
to project farmers in order to select a representative sample, and then
establishment of a system for recording the data at farm level. For this to be
of real value, it is important that the pre-development position of project
farmers be established accurately, and that a control group be identified and
their progress recorded. Key parameters involved would be yield per ha, cropping



ANNEX 9
Page 2
intensity and patterns, input mix and use per ha for different crops, input and
product prices at farm-gate, farm family and hired labor inputs and costs,
degree and amount of technical and credit assistance required to achieve
different responses, water charges, land rent, family use of farm production,
and gross and net disposable incomes.
4.        For the social infrastructure components, efforts would be made to
establish the demand for schools, health, water, and electricity services in
rural villages, at various levels of user charges, and the willingness and
ability of villagers to share in the investment costs, and to relate these to
the income of beneficiaries and other probable causal factors.
5.        Significant organizational problems in project implementation would
be recorded. At the village level, problems in organizing for contributing
investment capital, in operating and maintaining facilities and collecting
revenues for water and electricity would be expected. Important problems of
land acquisition, redistribution and, and resettlement would be recorded as
well as the costs.
6.        In the case of Feeder Roads, a few key sections would be selected for
analyses of traffic before and after project construction (or improvement) and
efforts would be made to identify and establish relationships between these
factors and the contributing area populations and agricultural production.
7.        The Unit also would establish a sampling system and follow-through
procedures adequate to provide information on present farmers and shareholders
who are not given project land, but who follow alternative paths of livelihood.
Data on the amounts of local and outside labor employed during and after
construction of the project would be collected and analyzed.
8.        The project accounts and sub-accounts, which would be maintained by
CODEVASF, would be analyzed by the Unit for data on unit costs of providing
the many services planned under the project. The extent of cost recovery and
the adequacy of operation and maintenance would receive close scrutiny in the
analyses of the social infrastructure components. The Unit would develop, in
consultation with CODEVASF, at project inception the format and content of
records and accounts which should be maintained by CODEVASF to facilitate
the work of the Unit and to minimize duplication of efforts.
9.        The Bank places considerable importance on the monitoring of this
project and therefore would propose to share in the financing of the
estimated US$120,000 costs of the work over the four-year project period.

CODEVASF
A. Background
General
1.        The Sao Francisco Valley has received special development attention
for many years. The Federal Constitution of 1946 included provision for no
less than 1% of the Government's tax revenues to be allocated to the Valley
for a period of 20 years to create basic conditions for development. To
administer this program, Law No. 541 of December 15, 1948 created a Commission
of the Sao Francisco Valley (Comissao do Vale do Sao Francisco - CVSF) to
coordinate, promote and control the activities which contribute to the de-
velopment objective. It was charged with developing a general utilization
plan for the Valley including river regulation, power and irrigation, stimu-
lation of industry and agriculture, transportation and communication,
improvement of health and education, and development and conservation of
minerals and vegetation. The Commission, during its 20 years of existence,
carried out a series of studies and surveys and promoted agro-livestock pro-
duction and engineering works, many of which were of infrastructure character.
Major construction projects through the Sao Francisco Hydroelectric Power
Commission (CHESF) were the Tres Marias and Paulo Afonso hydroelectric develop-
ments. Support was also given to crop and livestock development, health,
education and other sectors. In the later years of its existence, a decreas-
ing percentage of Government tax revenue (below the 1%) was allocated; there
was a decrease in purchasing power, and a trend emerged toward regional
agencies such as the Superintendency for Development of the Northeast (SUDENE),
which was established in 1959.
2.        On February 27, 1967 by Law No. 292, the Commission was converted
into a semi-autonomous entity, the Superintendencia do Vale do Sao Francisco,
SUVALE. The headquarters of both CVSF and SUVALE were located in Rio de
Janeiro. SUVALE's basic purpose was to promote the economic development and
utilization of the natural resources of the Valley, principally its water
and soils. Its main activity has been in identifying priority areas for
irrigation and agricultural development and in implementation of selected
projects. Its character also included the promotion of investment opportuni-
ties, principally in the agro-industrial sector. SUDENE has had responsibility
for coordination in planning and project implementation in accordance with its
annual plans for the Northeast. Decree No. 73566, January 25, 1974, also gave
SUVALE authority to expropriate lands for public need and social interests in



ANNEX 12
Page 2
accordance with existing expropriation laws. Additionally, the decree pre-
scribed policy in dividing expropriated units in family-size units and the
sale to small owners.
3.        As successor to SUVALE, the Sao Francisco Valley Development Company
(Companhia de Desenvolvimento do Vale de Sao Francisco -- CODEVASF) was
established by Law No. 6088 of July 16, 1974 with the statutes approved by
Decree No. 74,744 of October 22, 1974, as a public-sector enterprise under
the Ministry of the Interior. CODEVASF now is a fully-operational organiza-
tion, with headquarters in the Federal District (Capital City) of Brasilia.
Chart 9340 shows the relationship of CODEVASF to the Minister of Interior.
Major Accomplishments
4.        SUVALE and CVSF accomplished much during their combined 27-year
existence. Typical activities were:
Cartography - 290,000 km  mapped, 59,000 km  under contract;
Hydrology - 74 permanent stream gaging stations and precipitation
network established;
Geology - Site investigations and maps for over 16 dam and develop-
ment sites;
Irrigation - Cr$200 million spent or contracted for new projects and
farmer irrigation training center established at
Bebedouro;
Agriculture - Experimental farms on most irrigation pilot projects,
and expended Cr$1.8 million in 1974 for Agricultural
Extension in Valley, through ABCAR;
Health - Contracted to other agencies in 1974 for Cr$2.5 million
for betterment of water and sanitary systems;
Education and Training - Contracted to other agencies in 1974 more
than Cr$3 million of work; and
Research - Contracted to universities, E4BRAPA, and others, Cr$1.36
million in 1974.
Budgetary Trends and Fund Sources
5.        Table 1 provides annual data on SUVALE and CVSF budgetary expendi-
tures from 1950 through 1973.



ANNEX 12
Page 3
SUVALE's 1974 budget by sources was as follows:
UNIAO (General Federal Budget)                 Cr$ 65,000,000
Proprios (receipts estimated)                      15,000,000
PIN                                                56,000,000
PROVALE                                            40,000,OOO
FDPI                                               15,500,000
Total                   Cr$ 191,500,000
The UNIAO appropriation is used largely (85%) to finance SUVALE's administra-
tive organization. Over 40% of the administration budget was allocated for
headquarters expenditures, which is an indication of SUVALE's centralized
operations. It should be pointed out that in the use of project funds for
capital expenditures such as the proposed loan, all indirect expenses, in-
cluding preparation and awarding of contracts, would be financed from UNIAO
funds. About 8% of the UNIAO budget allocation is programmed for agro-
livestock development, with smaller sums for assistance, colonization and
agrarian reform, natural resources and sanitation activities. The Proprios
fund is derived from reimbursable services such as rental of tractors, while
PIN, PROVALE, and FDPI funds are allocated by the National Development Planning
agency:
(a) PIN (Program for National Integration) funtds are used for irriga-
tion projects and related activities, such as soil surveys and other studies,
and rural extension assistance;
(b) PROVALE (Special Program for the Sao Francisco Valley) funds are
used for integrated development purposes, including irrigation projects,
medical and other health assistance, sanitary and water system projects,
urban development, and training projects; and
(c) FDPI (Fund for Integrated Program Development) funds are programed
for the Sao Desiderio Irrigation Project.
International Assistance Programs and Training
7.        International programs have been important to SUVALE in the irrigated
agriculture sector with training and assistance having been provided by UNDP,
OAS, and the U.S. AID Programs. Unfortunately, there has been a heavy turn-
over in trained employees, and SUVALE did not realize all the benefits of
these programs. As an example, 43% of the professional employees who received
special training in the United States and in group training courses in Brazil
during the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation technical assistance program from
January 1969 - August 1973, had left SUVALE by October 1974.



ANNEX 12
Page 4
S.        There have been three UNDP-financed projects, with FAO as the ex-
ecuting agency 1960-74. During 1974, the third project was financed by SUVALE
but administered by FAO. A new UNDP project has been approved for technical
assistance training in irrigation, including: preparation of contracts;
supervision of construction, project operations, and maintenance; training
of technicians and farmers in water use; conduct of field trials; and establish-
ment of demonstration areas and training centers. It will become operational
by late 1975.
9.        There is one training center for technicians in the valley, at
Petrolina, which is under the auspices of OAS-IICA, and SUVALE has been send-
ing six to eight technicians there annually. Under the proposed new UNDP
project, FAO would also provide instruction at the Petrolina Center. The
UNDP/FAO assistance project would supply additional insurance for the success
of the Emergency Project. CODEVASF's plans in the personnel field, including
new salary schedules, job descriptions and advancement on a merit basis,
should go far in developing and retaining an efficient organization. Up to
the present, training has been largely oriented to the technical areas. There
is a definite need for administrative management training at different levels
and for organization and management specialists at Central headquarters and in
major field agencies.
B. Functions
10.       CODEVASF will operate as a private sector development company with
planning, coordination, and executive functions. It will act on belhalf of
the Ministry of Interior as the leading federal development agency in the
Sao Francisco Valley.
General Objectives
11.       CODEVASF objectives are to develop and utilize the water and land
resources of the Valley, either directly or through public and private
sectors, by:
(a) farming, stockraising and agro-industrial activities;
(h) promoting the integrated development of priority areas;
(c) establishing agro-industrial and general agricultural
districts;
(d) coordinating or carrying out infrastructure projects, with
particular emphasis on irrigation, including water impoundments,
construction of necessary canals, drainage, electrification and
transportation works;



ANNEX 12
Page 5
(e)  resettlement and training of small and medium scale farmers,
research, technical assistance, and health and education programs;
(f)  establishing or participating in the establishment of entre-
preneurial projects;
(g)  promoting or carrying out statistical, mapping, geological,
soil and land classification and related studies, including
water levels and pollution indexes; and
(h)  arranging for the expropriation of land needed for authorized
projects.
In accomplishing its objectives the Corporation is enjoined to:
(a)  encourage private enterprises by promoting their establishment
(it may even participate in the capital of ventures engaged in
the production, processing, and industrialization of primary
commodities);
(b)  draw up, in collaboration with other public agencies, annual
and multi-annual programs for integrated development, and
indicate priorities;
(c)  plan, construct and operate works and structures such as dams,
canals, pumping facilities, water supply and treatment, and
basic drainage;
(d)  set up and operate irrigation projects; and
(e)  carry out works to regulate rivers, control flooding
and pollution, and combat drought.
Inter-Organizational Relationships
12.       In carrying out its functions, CODEVASF normally would act through
state, municipal, or private agencies, using these parties whenever possible
for the execution of projects by contract or agreement. Programs and budgets
must be approved by SUDENE to insure that they are in accordance with the
general programs and economic policies of that agency for the Northeast.
SUDENE assists in supporting them before the National Developing Planning
and Budget agencies. CODEVASF will cooperate with the 2tinistries of Agri-
culture, Education, and liealth in research and assistance programs in their
respective fields of action, and with the Brazilian Institute of Geography
and Statistics and other entities in statistical studies, mapping and related
studies.
13.       The Corporation may carry out all activities necessary for the full
implementation of its programs, including those for which other agencies have



ANNEX 12
Page 6
jurisdiction when such agencies are unable to administer them themselves upon
being requested to do so. When this occurs, CODEVASF, with authority dele-
gated from the responsible agencies, may act as an agent of those agencies
and enter into agreements, contracts, or arrangements with national, foreign
or international bodies. In the execution of projects, it may collaborate
with sector entities in accordance with guidelines from the responsible
ministries.
C. Organization and Management
Management Responsibilities
14.       CODEVASF has a Board of Governors (Conselho Director) presided over
by the Chairman of the Company, made up of one representative each from the
Department of National Planning, the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry
of Transportation, and the Ministry of Mines and Energy, and four additional
members appointed by the Minister of the Interior from among Brazilian
nationals of recognized technical ability. The direct appointees of the
Minister of the Interior constitute a majority of the Board.
15.       The Board of Governors is required to approve the Master Plan and
specific programs of CODEVASF activities; set priorities in programming and
budgets and oversee their execution; approve execution of activities that
the competent agencies are unable to administer as specifically requested by
the responsible ministers; review statements of annual accounts and finances;
decide on disposition of operating profits, establishment of reserves, and
as appropriate, make proposals to the Minister of the Interior for increasing
CODEVASF's capital, including loan requests; approve participation in the
capital of other enterprises, cooperatives and joint ventures; approve the
Corporation's by-laws and organization, including establishment of regional
and local branches; and resolve other important program and policy matters.
16.       The administration of CODEVASF is the responsibility of a Board of
Executive Directors composed of the Chairman of the Corporation and three
Directors appointed by the President of the Republic. It has top level
responsibility for the planning, organization, coordination and supervision
of CODEVASF's activities to ensure that it achieves its corporate purposes.
It implements the rules and regulations of the Board of Governors and makes
proposals to that body; prescribes rules for the procurement of services and
for technical studies; authorizes leasing of Company assets to third parties
and leasing by CODEVASF of third party assets; examines balance sheets and
annual reports and statements; and performs other high level administrative
functions.



ANNEX 12
Page 7
Organization Status - March 1975
17.       The Decree of October 22, 1974 approving the statutes of CODEVASF
specified that the Ministry of the Interior should arrange for the formation
and establishment of CODEVASF within a 30-day period and appoint a special
commission to arrange for the transfer of SUVALE, SUDENE and DNOCS assets
located in the Valley. CODEVASF appears to want to delay taking over these
assets since the value thereof would correspondingly reduce the Cr$ 300
million capital to be furnished by the N4ational Treasury in 1974, 1975 and
1976 fiscal years, starting with a special credit of Cr$80 million for 1974.
18.       The General Manager and the three Directors constituting the Board
of Executive Directors were appointed in October 1974, and are now performing
their duties.  They appear to be qualified professionals for these key posi-
tions.  One Director is in charge of Planning and Finance, another is
responsible for Operations; and the third is Director of Technical Activities.
Information was not available on the composition of the Board of Governors.
19.       A Brazilian administrative management consultant was engaged by
CODEVASF to help chart the new organization structure for the headquarters
and field entities and to develop procedures. The systems being developed
include auditing, accounting, financial, personnel and training.
Management Consultant Proposals
20.       The proposed organization is shown on Chart No. 9339.  There would
be four Regional offices with a high degree of autonomy - the extent of which
has yet to be defined -- and there would be project offices under them. The
project offices would likewise have a high degree of decentralized management.
Regional headquarters for the project area would be at Aracaju, the capital
of the State of Sergipe.
Personnel Considerations
21.       The CODEVASF organization, with headquarters at Brasilia, is planned
as a decentralized operation. The degree of decentralization had not yet
been determined, nor had the manning levels, at the time of post-appraisal
in February 1975. The field project consultant had made estimates of project
manning requirements and the Chief of the 6th Agency had estimated personnel
needs for regional responsibilities under the Emergency Plan. Decentraliza-
tion will require substantially fewer employees in Brasilia than previously
were employed in Rio.
22.       While there was considerable discussion regarding the-refusal of
numbers of employees in Rio to move to Brasilia, this did not appear to be
a serious problem. From the management standpoint, it was regarded as an
opportunity to remove employees who had not been performing satisfactorily.
The current list of 76 employees presently approved for transfer includes
four of nine accountants, six of ten economists, 18 of 31 civil engineers,
and 16 of 20 agronomists. Transfer by April 1975 was planned.

23.       Personnel to fill positions in the field have been recruited largely
from localities other than Rio. In the Emergency Project Area, the majority
of the professional field positions and all of the lower category positions
have been filled from candidates in the Northeast area. This would be ex-
pected to continue.
24.       A new salary schedule has been developed, based on the practices
of one of the most progressive Brazilian companies (The Petroleum Production
Corporation -- PETROBRAS). CODEVASF's adaptation would add additional re-
quirements such as classifying professional personnel in four different
categories. Government employee practices would not apply, but labor pro-
visions for private employment would be followed. The new salary schedule
with higher rates should provide an additional incentive and reduce turnover.
D. Operations
Financial Management
25.       The initial capital, held entirely by the Government, will be Cr$ 300
million divided into 300 million units of registered stock, each having a
value of Cr$ 1.00. The sum is to be largely obtained by subscription by the
National Treasury, together with a smaller component consisting of the asset
value of SUDENE and DNOCS property in the Valley. The capital may be increased
by decision of the Executive Branch through incorporation of reserves, rein-
vestment of profits, revaluation of assets, or addition of Government capital.
26.       The Office for Finance has responsibility for planning, coordination,
and control of financial activities for the Central Headquarters and decen-
tralized field units. It is to include separate units for the Treasury,
Receipts, Financial Coordination, and for Fixed Assets. The Director of
Operations would have a Department of Accounting, with separate units for
accounting records and for accounting control.
Audits
27.       A staff unit for Information would report directly to the General
Manager.  It would have a separate Department of Audit and Investigations.
This unit will have authority to make field audits and investigations and
obtain any information needed. It is to be an independent unit outside the
operational management line.
28.       Audit activities of SUVALE would be the starting point for CODEVASF
procedures. SUVALE's financial controls and audit procedures have been
intensive. At the ministerial level, there has been a General Inspection
Unit for Finances (Inspetoria Geral de Financas), and the legislative has had
a General Accounting Unit (Tribunal). As a example of audit intensity, during



ANNEX 12
Page 9
the past year three field audits were made of the Lower Sao Francisco 6th
Agency's accounts by the Headquarters independent Audit Unit. A total of
80 man-days were used for the audits.
29.       The SUVALE Audit Unit, outside the operating line, reported direct-
ly to the Superintendent of SUVALE. It had a Control and Performance Service
Unit and an Audit and Revision Service Unit. The Headquarters Directorate of
Administration had an Accounting Division with a Budget and Accounting Section
and on Accounting Records Section. The Regional Agency Offices had accounting
Sections, with separate units for classification of documents for payment.
30.       While CODEVASF will continue to use Government funds, the inspec-
tions and audits from the Ministerial level will be more indirect for CODEVASF
the Corporation, than for SUVALE, the Government agency. CODEVASF authorities
have agreed to provide for annual audits of project accounts by independent
auditing firms. This would give added assurance on the use of funds for the
Emergency Project.
Contracting
31.       Detailed project plan preparation, supervision of construction and
project construction are to be carried out by contracts with private firms.
Contracting procedures are judged to be adequate. These include requirements
for preparation of bids; advertising procedures (including time periods);
establishment of bidder qualifications; analyses of bids received. Improve-
ment is needed in procedures for engineering inspections of the contractors'
performance by SUVALE personnel. CODEVASF management plans to strengthen
these operations before commencing the project.
E. Appraisal of CODEVASF Current Capabilities
32.       The changes that CODEVASF has undergone, organizationally and
geographically, will undoubtedly cause some initial loss of efficiency, but
it is believed that the positive effects of these changes will soon manifest
themselves in a much more effective entity, entirely capable of executing the
proposed project. Some important improvements are as follows:
(a) the new GeneralNManager and his three Division
Directors appear to be experienced, capable, vigorous,
and enthused with their new and challenging assignments.
(b) the new management group and the Emergency Project has the
full support of a dynamic Minister of the Interior.
(c) a greatly improved salary structure, now comparable to that of
PETROBRAS, the Brazilian Oil Production Entity, has helped



ANNEX 12
Page 10
retain many of the better employees, and to attract highly-
qualified, new, staff.
(d) an improved management structure will promote more effective
comuiunications and more timely and efficient results.
(e) the new organizational structure and salaries, plus opportunities
to contribute to the detailed planning, design, contracting and
operation of several large projects (one of which would be the
Emergency Project), should greatly improve organization morale
and performance.
Those improvements will be supplemented by the already-existing and generally
adequate, contracting and financial procedures, inherited from SUVALE.
33.       During appraisal, the mission discussed with CODEVASF and its
management consultant, certain areas of administration which perhaps could
be improved, such as:
(a) fixing definite ermployee responsibility for accomplishing
specific jobs and for formal performance evaluation ratings
which would lead to reward for good work and career ladder
advancement. Training needs for promotion should be given
greater considerations;
(b) decentralizing minor decision making;
(c) providing more training of capable employees in administrative
management; past training has been almost exclusively oriented
to technology transfers, and a point is reached where the technical
employee knows more than he has opportunity to use; one of the
important needs now, specifically in connection with the
Emergency Project, is to combine men, money, and machines into
effective operating units to get things done; and
(d) increasing contract supervision, especially intensity and frequency
of field inspection of contractor operations.
34.       The mission considers CODEVASF to be competent to effectively utilize
the proposed loan for the Lower Sao Francisco Erm,ergency Project.

ANNEX 13

BRAZIL
LOWER SAO FRANCISCO POLDERS PROJECT
Agricultural Production and Farm Budgets
Marituba and Betume
1.        The provision of controlled irrigation in these two varzeas would
involve a transition from traditional agriculture in which, practically the
only inputs are the seed and hand labor, to an intensive market-oriented
agriculture with double cropping, which would call for increased farm mech-
anization for land preparation and the regular use of fertilizers and pest
control chemicals.
2.        On irrigated land, rice would be the principal crop grown, occupying
4,400 ha of a total irrigated area on both varzeas of 5,200 ha, or over 80%.
No change would be expected in the method of cultivation with hand trans-
planting because most of the heavier rice soils cap badly when they dry out,
making them unsuitable for direct drilling, while sowing of pregerminated seed
on a thin film of water calls for very good land leveling. Transplanting also
permits a longer period of time for land preparation, which will be needed
with the rather slow maturing but well adapted varieties grown at present.
It is envisaged that two full crops of rice would be grown by year 4 following
establishment of the farms. Initially, on part of the area, a ratoon crop
would be taken following a rainy season rice crop. The varieties grown locally
ratoon well, provided they are irrigated and top dressed with nitrogen. Rice
yields, now around 2 tons per ha, are expected to reach 3.5 tons per ha by
year 4, while ratoon crops should yield around 1.4 tons per ha.
3.        On irrigated combro areas, the traditional crops:  corn, beans,
cotton and mandioca would be grown during the rainy season with some supple-
mentary irrigation. Peanuts could also be cultivated, as they are well suited
to the sandy soils, although they are not grown locally at present. During
the dry season, irrigated vegetable crops (tomatoes, onions) would be introduced
gradually to take advantage of the present lack of local production of such
items over that period. Other crops which might eventually be introduced on
irrigated combro land include bananas, pineapple, and citrus, depending on
the market and prices. At present, neither pineapple nor citrus appear
attractive from this standpoint.
4.        The basic farm model (Model 1) consists of half a hectare of irri-
gated combro land situated close to the residential areas, with 2.5 ha of
rice land at some considerable distance (2 to 3 km). At full development,
this farm would absorb about 440 family labor days out of the total 600 esti-
mated to be available; little hired labor would be required. This model would



ANNEX 13
Page 2
account for over three-fourths of the new farm holdings to be created and
would, at full development, lead to an annual family income about six to eight
times the minimum wage at the time of the mission visit (Table 1.)
5.        Farm Model 2 is introduced on Marituba where irrigated combro land
is quite small. It consists of 2 ha of irrigated rice land and 2 ha of un-
irrigated combro land. Family incomes would be some Cr$ 2,600'per year less
than in Model 1, making use of 400 days of family labor. Some hired labor
would be required--about 50 man-days, mainly at the time of transplanting of
rice and harvest of cotton. In this model, incomes could in the future be
improved if introduction of sprinkler irrigation, which was proposed by the
SUVALE consultants, proves practicable.
6.        In some unirrigated sandy soils in Betume, the combro land could be
planted with coconuts instead of horticultural crops. Even though initially
family incomes would be somewhat lower than on Model 1, they would be higher
when coconut trees reach full bearing (Table 2).
7.        Farm Model 3 (Table 3) could be developed on some 1,500 ha of non-
irrigable heavy soil in Marituba, which could be ploughed up and planted with
improved pasture (Pangola or Para grass) and used to fatten steers purchased
from the interior at the beginning of the Lower Sao Francisco rainy season
but at the beginning of the dry season in the interior. Over a period of six
to eight months, liveweight gain is expected to be 90 kg per head, and this,
with a 10% advantage in price for fat stock, makes the enterprise, which is
already practiced in the area, profitable. Stocking rate for the fattening
period would be four steers per ha. A holding of 12 ha (Table 4) would lead
to incomes about double those of Model 1 and 2 but it would absorb somewhat
less family labor. Labor-use profiles for these two models are presented
in Tables 9 and 10. Farm Model 3 does not have labor demand peaks. However,
this enterprise requires a considerable amount of business acumen and presents
higher commercial risks than the other two models (basic assumptions for all
three models are presented in Table 5).
Prices
8.        Adjusted prices for rice and beef have been based on Bank
price projections, while internal prices were used for beans, manioc, peanuts,
tomatoes and onions, which were considered non-tradeable commodities. Infor-
mation on Price Structure for Rice is presented in Table 8. For details on
the other crops, see Tables 4, 6 and 7.
Operation and Maintenance
9.        Energy costs represent about 20% of estimated annual O+M costs.  As
indicated in the text, CODEVASF and CHESF are exploring means by which the
latter could grant concessions on power rates at full commercial prices.
Were concessionary power rates to be available, they would improve the
financial returns of the project and its beneficiaries.



ANNEX 13
Page 3
Farm Mechanization
10.       Tractor and farm machinery requirements are based on requirements
during the peak months, March and September. During these periods tractors
will operate with two shifts with an effective working time of 12 hours per
day. by year 4, 57 units will be required, including a 10% allowance for
spare units. With this number of units there would be one tractor for every
110 ha excluding pasture areas or one per 65 ha of irrigated land. Akverage
annual operating time would be 1,200 hours. Tractors and machinery would be
owned and operated by the cooperatives under the supervision of CODEVASF staff.
CODEVASF would appoint agricultural engineers in Betume and M4arituba to train
operators and mechanics and to organize the operation of machinery and the
keeping of records.
11.       Additional threshing machinery will be needed for threshing the
increased rice production. output of the models proposed fitted with a 12 h.p.
engine is 1.2 tons/hour.  Working over a four-month period for both crops and
8 inours per day with 100 effective working days output per machine would be
960 tons and an additional 18 threshers will be required to handle the addi-
tional output for Betume and Mlarituba by year 4.

ANNEX 14

LOWER SAO FRANCISCO POLDERS PROJECT
Economic Rate of Return
1.        The Economic Rate of Return was calculated on the basis of data
shown in Tables 1 to 7 of Annex 13.  Key assumptions and adjustments made
were:
(a)  The official rate of exchange has been used as the shadow
rate of exchange.
(b) The prices of investment and operational cost items and output
in real terms would remain at October 1974 price levels.
(c) Adjusted Bank projections for rice and beef prices were used.
(d) Transfer payments were not charged to the project.
(e) The shadow wage of skilled labor was assumed to equal the
monetary wage since these are set by relatively free market
forces.
(f)  The shadow wage of unskilled hired labor was also assumed to
be equal to the monetary wage since hiring of foreign labor
for the farm occurred only at peak demand periods (sowing and
hiarvesting).
(g) The shadow wage of unskilled family labor was assumed to equal
60% of the monetary wage since there is heavy unemployment (para
3.05) in this area.
(h) Project costs were limited to those defined as developmental costs
and therefore did not include emergency works. They derive mainly
from increased rice production made possible by irrigation and
controlled flooding. This allows for double cropping in the
varzeas land. Consequently, project costs are those of the irrigation
works, fertilizer and improved seeds, plus one working animal in
the case of rice farms. In the beef farms, most of the costs are
related to pasture establishment and purchase of steers. Because
of project design, a very substantial part of on-farm operating
costs is provided by family labor. As it does not represent a
cash expenditure, family labor has not been considered in the
calculation of the financial rate of return, but it was computed
for the economic rate of return, and thus explains the substantial
difference between one and the other.



ANNEX 14
Page 2
2.        The project's overall rate of return to the economy over a period
of 35 years is estimated at 16% (Table 1). This represents the economic rate
of return for the two varzeas, Betume and Marituba, which will be brought to
full development. The sensitivity of the economic rate of return has been
tested against changes in investment costs, prices and yields. An increase
of investment costs by 10% would reduce the rate of return to 13%. If a 10%
increase in investment costs were accompanied by a 10% drop of sales receipts,
the rate of return would be 9%. A 10% increase in the value of production
because of increased prices or yields would increase the rate of return by
6 percentage points to 22%.
