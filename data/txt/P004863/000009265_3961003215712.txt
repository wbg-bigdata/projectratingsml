MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EECUTIE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED SUPPLEMENTAL CREDIT
TO WESTERN SAMOA
FOR AN EMERGENCY ROAD REHABILITATION PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and mecommendation on a proposed supplemental credit of
SDR 3.7 million (the equivalent of US$S.1 million) to the Independent State of Western Samoa is
submitted for approval. The supplemeal credit would result in an increase in the amount of
Development Credit 2132-WSO from SDR 10.9 million (JS$14 million) 1/ to SDR 14.6 million
(US$19.1 million).2/ The proposed supplemental credit would be repayable in 40 years (within the
same repayment period as the original credit) and would help finance the ongoing Emergency Road
Rehabilitation Project. The Australian Government will continue cofinancing of US$0.38 million
equivalent for technical assistance.
2.        Country Background. Western Samoa is a small country in the central South Pacific
consisting mainly of two volcanic islands, Upolu and Savai'i. The population of 160,000 is
concenaed on the coastal fringes of these islands and is reliant for tranwsportation en each island's
circumferential road. While basic indicators such as health and literacy are high by developing country
standards, the economy is fragile, dependent on substantial inflows of assistance and remittances and
very susceptble to external shocks. Agriculture dominates the economy, both in terms of subsistence
fIrming and of the value of exports. While the export of traitonal tradeables has cntinued to
decline, hastened by the impact of two recent cyclones, overall export earnings are estimated to have
increased in 1992 due to the growing importance of the manu g sector.
3.        Cyclones Ofa and Val. From February 1 to 4, 1990, Western Samoa was struck by
Cyclone Ofa. The South Western Pacific is an area which is susceptible to cyclones; however, those
equaUling the intensity of Ofa are very infrequent. In Samoa's case, the worst cyclone previously
recorded this century was the hurricane of 1966 in which winds of 82 knot (94 miles/hour, 43
meters/sec) were experienced; the last cyclone before 1990 to strike Samoa, Gina in January 1989,
recorded maximum wind speeds of 43 knots for one day and caused damage estmated at
US$8 million. By comparison, Cyclone Ofa lasted for four days with maximum wind speeds of
97 knots and wave heights in excess of 2 meters above normal, and caused damage estimated at
US$140 mitlion-a figure in the same order of magnitude as Western Samoa's estimated 1989 GDP
of US$139 million. The number of deaths amounted to eleven. Twenty-two months later, as the
economy was showing signs of recovery, Western Samoa was struck by Cyclone Val which hit the two
islands December 6-9, 1991. Val was characteized by very high winds which reached 92 knots with
gusts up to 130 knots, accompanied by torrential downpours. The damage to natura resources,
agriculture, infiastructure, health and education facilities, public and private structures of all kinds as
well as the lives and livelihood of the people was more than the damage caused by Cyclone Ofa. The
current estmate of damage is US$300 million. Of this total, just over 50 percent is the estimated cost
of damage to buildings, dwellings and other structwes, and nearly 40 percent was damage to primary

2v SDR 1 - US$1.386 on November 30, 1992.



industry, Infrastrucre, environment, parks and reserves. Exposed infrastructure such as roads and
bridges, power supply and distribution netwo.>ks and telecommunications services were very jadly
damaged. Water supply services also suffered damage mainly to water intakes and to water mains
whore uprooted trees and landslips ruptured the pipelines. At least 12 persons lost their lives during
Cyclone Val.
4.       Damage to the Transport Sector. Western Samoa's 2,400 km road network was
extensively damaged first by Cyclone Ofa, for which the Emergency Road Rehabilitation Project was
prepared, and then by Cyclone Val. Most of the important roads run along the coasts in both islands
of Upolu and Saval'i and many sections suffered severe wave damage as well as rain and flood
damage. Virtually all roads were affected to some extent, including secondary, rural and plantion
access roads. Approximately 15 of the country's major bridges sustained significant d&nage, from
complete washouts to varying degrees of abutment and embankment scour and bed erosion, leaving
the strctural integrity of some bridges in question.
5.        Exisdng coastal protection works around Apia, some of them hastily constructed after
Cyclone Ofa, were severely damaged by Cyclone Val. In addition, serious erosion caused by Val in
the Apia area and along other coastal areas in Upolu and Savai'i has endangered important assets
(roads, major buildings, hospitals, etc.) calling for new coastal protection works.
6.       Total damage to the transportation system is estimated at US$34.8 million, which includes
the road system, bridges and coastal protection works. However, the above amount includes
mWedhm-etm as well as immediate priorites. Only immediate prionty works, involving damage
caused by Cyclone Val to roads in the project area, are included in the revised project.
7.        Response by Government and Donors. The response after the cyclone was prompt, both
from the Government as well as donors and the enormous task of cleanup and restoration of services
to critical areas commenced immediately after the cyclone ended. The National Disaster Council
(NDC) convened its first meeting immediately after the cyclone on the morning of Wednesday,
December 11, 1991. The Public Works Department (PWD) performed well at reopening roads and
provid    wat supplies and equipment. Donors intervened promptly with emergency supplies and
distribution of initial shipments was directed to community facilities such as hospitals and the library
with subsequent shipments for schools and government buildings.
8.       Donor Assistance for Rehabilitation. As of mid-March 1992, aid donors had indicated
that approximately US$8 million had already been allocated to emergency rehabilitation work. The
New Zealand Government committed NZ$4.0 miliion (US$2.2 million) for the repair of Western
Samoa's junior secondary schools. A cash grant of NZ$1 million was also made available by New
Zealand for materials to be used in restoration work on village primary schools. New Zealand also
assisted in the repair of the power and telephone line networks as well as with the repair of hospitals.
Austalia provided a grant of A$2 million (US$1.52 million) for rehabilitation work in priority areas
agreed in consultation with the Government of Western Samoa (GWS) as well as A$1 million
(JS$0.76 million) in food aid support. Assistance was also provided under Australia's emergency and
commodity assistance programs. Assistance fiom ADB, EC and Japan had been identified for
rehabilittion work in the power, ports, roads, water supply, agriculture and health sectors. BAD was
also considering the possibility of a loan for a rural activation program which included assistance for
the rehabilitation of school bufldings in rural areas. Additional indications of possible funding for
rehabilitation of inastructure, physical facilities and equipment were given during the
Country/Development Partners meeting in July 1992.

9.       Radonale for the Supplenental Credit.  Because of the need for financing the
reconstruction of roads damaged by Cyclone Ofa, an IDA Credit of SDR 10.9 million for the
Emergency Road Reh3bilitation Project (Credit 2132-WSO) was approved by the Executive )irectors
on May 17, 1990 (see the Memorandum and Recommendation of the President, Report No.
P-5295-WSO, dated May 3, 1990, including the Technical Annex). The main rationale for further
IDA involvement in the infrastructure sector would be to assist Western Samoa's economic recovery
through restoation of essential infrastructure facilities. This would be achieved by reconstruction of
roads further damaged by Cydone Val. Also, the Association's participation in coordinating donor
involvement, would give it opportunities to influence sector policies, support institutional development
in PWD and help alleviate the adverse impact of Cyclone Val on the economy.
10.      Other than Australia, which is continuing to support the improvement of maintenance by
PWD, and ADB, which is considering financing the reconstruction of two road sections on Upolu,
financing is not available from other donors who have already committed their assistance to other
sectors. Any frther delays in completing the project would entail partial or total demobilization of
contractors and supervising consultants. This would result in higher costs. A supplemental credit is
therefore proposed to ensure fill implementation of the project.
11.      Project Objectives. The overall objective of the project has not changed: to alleviate the
severe disruption to the transportation sector caused by cyclone damage. It would also help restore
econ '-nic activities in Upolu and Savai'i by the full rehabilitation of some sections of circumferential
roads as well as coastal protection works. The project would also assist the Government to carry out
independent audits of project accounts of ongoing IDA-financed projects (see para. 14 below).
12.      Project Description. Thie project, as described in the Technical Appendix attached to the
Memorandum and Recommendation of the President for Credit 2132-WSO, remains essentially the
same with some adjustment because of Cyclote Val. The roads being rehabilitated under Credit 2132-
WSO will be completed with reconstruction or repair of new cyclone damage and addidonal coastal
protection works as required. Reconstruction of the Upolu East Coast Road (Moataa-Saluafata,
19.6 kIn), will involve some minor realignments where the road goes around a cliff whose shoreline
will remain unprotected because of the depth of water at the cliff base. Extensions of 15 months for
the supervising consultants' contracts have been included. In addition, maintenance equipment
requirements, agreed after Cyclone Ofa, have been reviewed and revised. A small component has
been added to assist GWS to carry out audits of the project accounts of the Association's ongoing
projects. The attached Technical Annex sets out details of the revised project.
13.      Project Cost and lFlnandng. The revised project costs and the financing plan are shown
in Schedule A (more detailed estimates are presented in the Annex). Since implementation of works
and services financed by the supplemental credit is based on extension of existing contracts,
procurement has already been accomplished, except for the equipment, an institudonal study, and
overseas training. The revised IDA disbursements are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of
processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Western Samoa are given in Schedules
C and D. A map is also attached.
14.      Agreed Actions. Compliance with the agreed actions under Credit 2132-WSO has been
satisfactory, except for the delayed submission to IDA of audited project accounts. This is a general
problem in Westen Samoa caused by the additional workload arising from a change in the fiscal year
and the disruption of Cyclone Val. Ihe Association has agreed a plan with GWS together with project
implementing agencies to bring the ongoing IDA projects into compliance with audit covenants. An



-4 -
assumce has been obtained that GWS will provide the Association with audit reports by independent
auditors acceptable to the Association. Audits for the 30-month period January 1, 1990 to September
30, 1992, will be submitted by September 30, 1993. Ihere will be no change to the conditionality of
the original Development Credit Agreement under the Supplemental Credit and the closing date
remains December 31, 1994. The project is expected to be completed by December 31, 1993.
15.      Environmental Impact. The entire project Is devoted to reconstruetion of roads including
coastal protection, almost endrely within existing rights c ¢ way. The minor road realignment on the
Upolu East Coast Road will not require resettlement. As long as reconstruction of these roads
including bridges and coastal protection is not delayed, there will be a beneficial impact on the
enviromnent. In addition, coastal protection will help prevent damage to roads and beaches, and also
adjacent villages, from wave action.
16.      Beneits. Transport communications on both islands of Western Samoa are dependent on
their circumferental roads which have been damaged by both cyclones. Resumption of normal
agricultural activity would depend on rehabilitation of the roads under the project as well as resumption
of nonnal transport movemens. Savings on vehicle operating costs would accrue to the economy.
Appropriate shore protection will help mitigate the effects of future cyclones as proven during Cyclone
Val.
17.      Risks. The main risk after Cyclone Ofa was the possibility of further damage before
renabilitation commenced, and this remains the main rts following Cyclone Val. However, all
contcs for rehabiitation of roads are underway. After the initial delays due to unfamiliarity with
international procurement, compounded by a change in fiscal year and elections followed by a change
in cabinet, GWS is now well prepared to complete the road reabilition.
18.      RecommendatIon. I am satisfied thatthe proposed supplemental credit would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend ta the Executive Directrs approve the
proposed Credit.

SUPPEM04TAL CREDIT
TO CREDIT 2132-WSO
EMERGENCY ROAD REHABHITATION ]PROJECT
TECHNCAL ANNEX
A. BACKGROUND
1.     Western Samoa has a land area of 2,934 kmn2 and a population of about 160,000. Both
of its main islands, Upolu and Savai'i, have central volcanic peaks, the highest being Mt.
Mata'aga on Savai'i, and narrow, fertile, coastal plains. Agriculture, forestry, fisheries and
tourlsm are the country's principal economic activities. Following a real GDP growth of
2 percent in 1989, GDP declined at an average annual rate of 4.5 percent in 1990-92, largely
due to the impact of cyclones Ofa and Val. The population is concentrated on the coastal fringes
of these islands and is reliant for communications on the circumferenta roads on both islands.
There was an extensive road network on the two main islands totlling about 2,400 km of which
240 km were sealed.
2.     The Recent Cydones. Cyclone Ofa struck Western Samoa continuously for four days
from February 1-4, 1990. Wind speeds of 97 knots were recorded with gusts of 105 knots,
while wave heights in excess of 2 meters above normal persisted for 1 ½ days. The duration of
the cyclone meant that substantily more damage was inflicted than normally expected. Cyclone
Ofa caused damage esdmated at US$140 million-a figure in excess of Samoa's estimated 1989
GDP of US$139 million. This cyclone hit mostly the agriculture and transport sectors. Twenty-
two monfts later, Western Samoa was again struck by Cyclone Val which hit the two islands
December 6-9, 1991. Winds reached 92 Inots with gusts up to 130 lnots, accompanied by
torrential rins. The damage caused by Val was more than the damage caused by Ofa, and the
current esimates of damage reaches US$300 million.
3.     Damage to Transport Infastructure. Following Cyclone Of, an Emergency Road
Rebabilitation Prject financed by Credit 2132-WSO, was approved to address the highest
priority road reconstruction needs. Rehabilitation of three roads, one in Upolu and two in
Savai'i, had been initiated under the project when Cyclone Val struck and frther damaged the
thee roads including the reconstruction works. The need for replacement of existing road
materls, shore protection, and damage to bridges is analyzed in paras. 6 to 11.
B. IDA's RESoNsE AND STRATEGY
4.     The Govermment of Western Samoa (GWS) requested the Association to prepare a
report on infrastructure rehabilitation needs following Cyclone Val. IDA agreed and sent a
mision to Western Samoa In March 1992. Ihe mission prepared the Infrastructure
Rehabilitation Needs Asssment Report, with the assistance of ADB and AIDAB. Ihe report
reviews the impact of Cyclone Val on the economy of Western Samoa and, in particular, on the
roads, telecommunications, power and water supply sectors. The impact on the economy has
adversely affected finances available for the Government's Public Sector Investment Program
(PSIP) under the Seventh Developmen Plan (DP7). It is likely that the Government revenue will



- 11 -
decline in real terms during 1992/93, as much as WS$20 million or more (in 1991 prices), and
such shortfall will restrict the Government's ability to contribute to the financing of the PSIP.
These facrs have been taken into account by the Planning Office and Government in general
and a reduced and prioritized PSIP has been formulated.
S.     The road subsector, for which a Credit 2132-WSO was approved on May 17, 1990, in
the amount of SDR 10.9 million, is the object of the Supplemental Credit. It will finance the
damage caused by Cyclone Val to the roads being rehabilitated following Cyclone Ofa. The only
other donors active in the road subsector, AIDAB and ADB, are continuing their assistance but
are also committed to assisting other sectors and cannot cover the rehabilitation needs of the
IDA-financed road works. However, AIDAB is providing A$500,000 to finance a Project
Mamger for this project.
C. DETAIED PROWr DESCRPTON
6.     Objectives. The objectives of the modified project are essentially the same as for the
existing project. It is intended to: (i) finance the reconstruction of roads damaged by Cyclone
Val; (ii) strengthen the PWD's planning, implementation, and management capacity, especially
for maintenance; and (Mii) assist the Government to carry out independent audits of IDA's
ongoing projects.
7.     Components.  The cost of the revised project including the Emergency Road
Rehabilitation Project, is estmated at US$21.23 million (See Annex to the Memorandum of the
President). It is aimed at specific elements of the road program to be carried out during
1991194. Extraordinary maitenance caused by Cyclone Ofa has been carried out and was
completed in 1991. For three sections of coastal roads, totalling 50.6 km, this involves the
iniial contract cost plus the damage caused by Cyclone Val, including additional shore protection
works. The navigation and road maintenance equipment components of the original project have
been retained. The current supervision contracts expired at the end of September 1992, and new
contracts, with the same consultants who prepared the design, have been prepared and are under
review by the Association.
8.     Reconstructlon/Rebblitatlon. Works have started on three sections of road, which
are the following:
(a) Salelologa-Puapua (SR2, 22 kIn) on the east coast of Savai'i linking the major villages
of the island. Severe damage was sustained between Tuasivi and Saipipi, a length of
7 km. Over 2 km of road were completely washed away, and about 2 kn of shore
protection were destroyed. The damage by Cyclone Val was estimated at WS$350,000
and the shore protection works were estimated at WS$480,000. Change orders to the
ongoing contract are estimated at an additional WS$1.37 million.
0b)  Sataua-Asau (R3, 9 kIn) on the north coast of Savai'i. Damage caused by Cyclone
Val resulted in the need for additional embankment materials, base course and shore
protection. A deviation between chainages 3,040 and 4,800 was necessary to avoid
running the road along the shore.  The additonal works were estimated at
WS$390,000.
(c)  Moataa-Saluatata (ECl, 19.6 kln). Cyclone Val caused damage to the bridges at
Mulival and Maepu, and removed existing road materials necessitating additional fill



- 12-
and shore protection between chainages 8,000 and 19,500. As a consequence
negotiations between PWD and the contractor began in April 1992 and an Addendum
was agreed, increasing the contract price from WS$11.93 million to WS$14.94 million
and extending the completion date of the road to July 18, 1993.
The above contract were originally awarded, with the Association's concurrence, in 1991.
9.     Equipment. Restoration/rehabilitation of roads aRer Cyclone Val will place heavy
demands on the existing equipment and there will be a need for equipment replacement. In
addition, PWD is charged with the cleaning of Apia streets and, among the equipment proposed
by PWD, is included a street suction sweeper. Gutters are easily clogged by sand and other
materials, thus the suction sweeper is much required. Sorely needed laboratory equipment is
also included. Navigation facilities In four pors and their channels as well as in three
lighthouses are also provided for.
10.    Consultancy Services. Detailed designs for a total of 95 km in Savai'i and 19.6 km
in Upolu were completed in 1991. Existing contracts for supervision expired at the end of
September 1992 and new draft contrats or both consultants have been prepared, and are under
review by the Association. An Institutional Strengthening Study is envisaged under this project
and terms of reference have been prepared. The project also financed a coastal protection test
and report carried out by a speciaist in this field. Past due audits of project accounts of ongoing
IDA Projects (including accounts of autonomous enties where applicable) are also to be
fianced under the project and are to be carried out by independent auditors satisfactry to the
Association.
11.    Oversas Trning. A small sum has been included in the project to provide for short-
term overseas training for several PWD managers. This trin  will mostly consist of
atance by highlevel managers at a mojor Itaiona road maintenance seminar.
12.    Revised Projed Cost Including the orighinl project). The basis for the esmates of
project cost has been the contracts for rehabilitation of roads signed in 1991, plus the estim
of additional works caused by Cyclone Val. Physical contingency of 25 percent has been added
to the latter estmates, as well as price contingencies of 6 percent on local cost and 3.7 percent
on foreign costs. Costs of new supervision conacts have been based on previous breakdown
rates for employed personnel. Detailed cost estimates are provided below.

The proposed IDA Supplemental Credit including the original credit would finance 90.0 percent
of total project cost (93.7 percent of total cost net of taxes and duties), while AIDAB would
finance up to US$0.38 million or 1.8 percent of total project cost (1.9 percent net of taxes and
duties). The Government would finance the remaining US$1.75 million or 8.2 percent of the
total estimated cost.

14.    Maintenance. AIDAB's two closely related projects (the resealing program, about
US$4.8 million, and the mechanical workshop upgrading and training program, about US$7.5
million, both of which are stil going on) are aimed at increasing PWD's maintnance capabilities
as required to meet its medium-term needs. However, in order to assure adequate mantenance,
there is a farther need for: (a) additional equipment which is being procured under the proposed
project (para. 9); and (b) a commitment from the Government for adequate funding of continued
road maintenance. These are estimated to be at least US$0.9 million in 1991, US$1.2 million
in 1992, and US$1.5 million in real terms annually thereafter. The Government changed its
fiscal year in 1991 from Jamnary 1 - December 31 to July 1 - June 30, therefore, there should
be an average in 1991/92 and 1992/93. For 1991/92 the budgeted account for roudne road
maitenance was US$2 million and for 1992/93 the budgeted sum for the same purpose was
equivalent to US$2.15 million, more than agreed with the Association.
15.    Project Management. The Project Manager, funded by AIDAB, was engaged in
August 1990 and the PWD staff to serve as Assistant Project Manager was appointed earlier.
Thus, the condition of credit effectiveness was fulfilled and the Credit was declared effective on
August 20, 1990. The Project Manager served for two years but resigned at the end of August
1992. The Assistant Project Manager was assigned to other duties a long time back. It is
important, therefore, that a Project Manager and an Assistant be nomina  as soon as possible.
PWD initiated recruitment of a new manager in October 1992, but it will take some months
before the manager assumes duty.

competitive bidding procedures) to firms that have had experience in Western Samoa or
participated in previous prequalification exercises there. A list of contractors was agreed with
the Government. The two contracts were reviewed and accepted by the Association.

18.    Because of the small size of equipment procurement and since standardization is of high
priority for equipment fleets such as those of PWD and the port authority, the equipment
financed under the project will be procured on the basis of international shopping by obtaining
at least three quotations from at least two countries eligible under the Guidelines. Items should
be grouped to the extent possible.
19.    The consultants for design and supervision have been employed on the basis of
procedures in accordance with the Bank Group guidelines. Consultants for the Institutional
Strengthening Study will be engaged on the same basis. Contracts have been reviewed or will
be reviewed by the Association. The Treasury Department will execute the audit financing
component, engaging independent auditors acceptable to the Association.
20.    Disbursements. The disbursements will continue to be made against applications as
follows:
(a)   Civil Works:
1) 50 percent of total expenditures for etraordinary maintenance (already disbursed
to a total of US$185,000).
(.i) 90 percent of total expenditures for reconstructionirehabilitation contracts;
(b) EquIpment: 100 percent of foreign expenditures, 100 percent of local expenditures
(ex-factory cost) and 65 percent of local expenditures for items procured locally;
(c)   Consu qancy Services: 100 percent of total expenditures; and
(d)  Overseas Training: 100 percent of total expenditures.
In order to facilitate disbursements, a Special Account was opened in the Central Bank of Samoa
in October 1990 for the purposes of the project by the Ministry of Finance. The Special
Account is maintained in US Dollars and an initial deposit of US$1.5 million was made as the
average expenditures for a four-month period. A schedule of estimated disbursements is given
in Table 1.
21.    RtroacIve Fhancing. Retroactive financing, not to exceed SDR 1.1 million, was
approved by the Board in respect of payments made for expenditr  after March 1, 1990 and
prior to May 25, 1990 (the date of Credit 2132-WSO) in respect of Civil Works and Consultancy
Services.
22.    Envirowment. The project is devoted to reconstruction of roads and coastal protection.
As long as reconstruction of these roads, including bridgas and coastal protection, is not delayed,
there will be a beneficial impact on the environment In addition, coastal protection will help
prevent damage to roads and beaches, and also adjacent villages, from wave action.
23.    Monitoring and Auditing. Ihe revised project implementation schedule is shown in
Chart 2. As the executing agency of the project, PWD will keep records of all procurement
documents (mcluding bids and proposais, and their evaluation and contract awards). With the
zssistance of the project manager, PWD will continue to prepare monthly reports with the



- 18 -
information listed above. The Government has reconfirmed assurances given at Credit
negotiations that:
(a)  PWD will keep separate accounts for the project, which has been done;
(b)  the project account will be audited annually by the GWS Auditor General (accepted
by IDA). Due to a substantially increased accounting and auditing worldoad arising
from a change in the Government fiscal year as weHl as the disruption caused by
Cyclone Val, Government has not been able to meet project audit deadlines. The
Association has agreed a plan with GWS to restore compliance with the audit covenant
by September 30, 1993; and
(c) PWD will retain, until at least one year after the Association has received the audit
report for the fiscal year in which the last withdrawal from the Credit Account or
payment out of the Special Account was made, all records evidencing such
expenditues.
