BOTSWANA
APPRAISAL OF SECOND DEVELOPMENT FINANCE COMPANIES PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01       In May-June 1982, the Botswana Government requested the Bank to
provide a credit line to the Botswana Development Corporation (BDC) and the
National Development Bank (NDB). BDC had already received a Bank loan of
US$4 million in 1974, which was fully disbursed in March 1982. Since Bank
knowledge of-NDB was very limited, NDB, in consultation with the Government
and the Bank, commissioned a firm of consultants to review NDB's role,
organization, policies, procedures, operations and financial situation.
This review was carried out in January 1983 and the report submitted to the
NDB and the Bank in February 1983. Following this review, an appraisal
mission visited Botswana between March 21, 1983 and April 13, 1983.
1.02      Reviewing the activities and operations of the two institutions
the appraisal mission concluded that both had distinctive roles to play:
BDC in promoting projects and attracting foreign investments in projects in
various sectors of the economy which were beyond the capability of local
entrepreneurs, and NDB in providing financial assistance to small scale
Batswana farmers and entrepreneurs 1/ in commercial and industrial
sectors. Accordingly, the mission has recommended a loan of US$12.3
million including lines of credit to both BDC (US$6.2 million) and NDB
(US$5 million), technical assistance (US$1 million) mainly to NDB, and
front-end fee.
1/ In this report, Small Scale Enterprises are defined as non-agricultural
enterprises requiring loans over P5000 and up to P20,000. Micro-credit
refers to an NDB loan (i) up to P20,000 for agriculture and (ii) up to
P5,000 for commercial and industrial enterprises.

II. THE PRODUCTIVE SECTORS
A. The Manufacturing Sector
Past Performance and Contribution to the Economy
2.01      The contribution of manufacturing to the national economy, while
growing, is still modest, with a share in GDP of less than 7% in 1980/81
(the last year for which GDP information is available). Manufacturing
value added more than doubled in real terms between 1973/74 and 1980/81,
but its share in GDP increased only slightly because other sectors of the
economy, especially mining and services, also grew rapidly. The share of
manufacturing in total productive activities, however, increased from 9% to
12% during that period. Employment in manufacturing also more than doubled
from 2,800 workers in 1973 to 6,400 2/ in 1981.  But, as employmeat in the
entire formal sector 3/ also doubled, the share of manufacturing in total
formal sector employment remained constant at around 6.6%. Most of the
expansion of manufacturing occurred between 1973 and 1978, when value added
grew at an average real rate of 20% per annum. In the following two years,
production declined by 15% in real terms due to a crisis in the processed
meat industry (caused by an outbreak of foot and mouth disease), which
accounts for over one fourth of the sector's value added. During the same
period, value added in the rest of the sector (food and beverages, textiles
and garments, metal products and construction materials) increased by 33%
in real terms. Since 1981, several new industrial projects have entered
into operation attracted by a new incentive scheme, and meat production
resumed its normal level. These developments point to a strong recovery of
the sector's overall growth.   Still, local production supplies only a
fraLction of Botswana's consumption of manufactured goods. The bulk of
these goods is imported, mainly from the Republic of South Africa (RSA).
2.02      Exports of manufactures, not including processed meat, grew in
real terms at an average yearly rate of 20% between 1974 and 1981. By 1981
manufactured exports amounted to nearly US$60 million, 4/ about 10% of the
country's total exports composed mostly of diamonds, meat and nickel-
copper. Non-traditional manufacturing exports consist mainly of textiles
and garments, footwear, candles, umbrellas and metal furniture. The bulk
of these exports goes to Zimbabwe where they enter duty free under a trade
agreement between the two countries. Many of the exporters are investors
2/ 43 new manufacturing firms established since 1981 are estimated to
have created up to 1,500 additional jobs.
3/ Formal sector employment excludes domestic servants and workers
employed in traditional agriculture and in informal village industries.
4/ This figure includes some reexporting.

from Zimbabwe attracted by Botswana's liberal foreign exchange regime and,
more recently, by its investment incentives. Zimbabwe has, however,
recently imposed quota restrictions on imports from Botswana obliging some
firms to look for alternative markets. These firms are having difficulties
because their prices and sometimes their quality are not competitive
outside the protected Zimbabwean market. Nevertheless, export
possibilities do exist particularly in markets where Botswana's exports can
also enter duty free. They include the RSA, Lesotho, and Swaziland, which
together with Botswana form the Southern African Customs Union (SACU), and
Malawi with which Botswana has a standing free trade agreement. Botswana' s
goods have also preferential access to the European Common Market (EEC),
under the Lome Convention agreement. At present the EEC market offers
little export possibilities to Botswana's manufactures because they are not
competitive with other exports that enjoy similar access conditiolns but
lower transport and production costs. However, handicrafts and
resource-based manufactures such as tannery products may have good
prospects in the EEC market.
Structure of Industry
2.03      Medium and Large Scale Industry.  Manufacturing establishments
with 10 or more workers require a license from the Ministry of Commerce and
Industry. The number of licensed firms increased sharply during 1982 and
1983 attracted by new investment incentives (para. 2.14): 64 firms
received their licenses between January 1982 and March 1983, compared with
29 firms during 1980 and 1981 combined. Forty-three of the newly licensed
firms had started operations by March 1983, raising to 146 the number of
firms in the formal manufacturing sector. The number of firms with more
than 100 workers increased from only five in 1978 to eight in 1981 and to
14 at the beginning of 1983. Besides the Botswana Meat Commission (BMC)
which employs about 1,800 workers in its abattoir, four firms now have more
than 200 workers each. These are: Everest Mills (250 workers), Hanoya
Agricultural Engineering (200 workers), Kgalagadi Breweries (200) and Corn
Products Animal Feed (216). Although the number of large firms is
increasing, most licensed firms (nearly 2/3) have less than 50 workers.
Most of the larger firms are concentrated in the major urban areas of
Gaborone, Francistown, Lobatse and Selebi-Phikwe.  Sixty eight of the
licensed firms are exporting or have potential to export.
2.04      In terms of the number of operating establishments, the main
subsectors are metal products with 35 firms and textiles and clothing with
29 firms. Food and beverages and construction materials come next with 18
firms each. However, in terms of value added and employment, the main
subsector is meat and meat products (30% of value added), followed by food
and beverages (24% of value added).  The food and beverages sector has also
the largest number of projects awaiting implementation (14), followed by
textiles and garmenits (10).

2.05       Most manufacturing enterprises in Botswana are privately owned.
Government's direct ownership in manufacturing is limited to the Botswana
Meat Commission (which owns the abattoir, a tannery and a meat canning
plant). Through the Botswana Developement Corporation the Government owns
several enterprises (e.g. Kgalagadi Breweries), and participates as a
shareholder in others (e.g. Botswana Furniture Manufactures). Although
more than 60% of all the firms in the manufacturing sector are foreign
owned, the proportion of locally owned firms has increased over time from
less than 7% of all firms created before 1980 to nearly 15% of all the
firms established since then; the rest of the firms (25%) are joint
ventures between local and foreign partners. Also, the proportion of
managerial and technical positions held by Botswana citizens has increased
from only 39% in 1978 to 61% in 1981.  These trends indicate a gradual
development of entrepreneurial and technical skills among Batswana.
2.06       Small-Scale Industry.  Although there is not enough information
to assess the role of small-scale industries in Botswana's industrial
structure, it appears to be substantial. It is estimated that 25,000
people, about 5% of the active labor force, work in the urban informal
sector producing goods and services. In addition, there are countless
informal village industries producing handicrafts and food and beverages
(e.g. home-brewed beer). Modern small industries, however, are relatively



5
few due to the shortage of entrepreneurial skills among Batswana, although
some improvement has taken place during the last few years. The Government
established the Batswana Enterprises Development Unit in 1972 to assist the
development of small industries, but its activities did not prove to be
cost effective (paragraph 2.08).
Institutional Framework
2.07      The Ministry of Commerce and Industry (MCI) has primary
responsibility for industrial policy. Some steps have been taken recently
to strengthen the Ministry, including the appointment of two expatriate
advisors. MCI assists industry through a number of specialized units and
agencies. One of these, the Investment Promotion Unit, has carried out a
number of feasibility studies that were made available to interested
investors. The Ministry is in the process of converting the Unit into the
Trade and Investment Promotion Agency (TIPA), a one-stop-service agency for
local and foreign investors. This agency will assist entrepreneurs with
investment procedures; promote trade through publications and missions
abroad; and provide inidustrial information through sector surveys and
feasibility studies. It will also compile an industrial land register to
facilitate the search for industrial land. The EEC has pledged P 1.1
million on a reimbursement basis to support TIPA for a period of five
years. The Government is in the process of defining the organizational
structure and the policy guidelines of the agency.
2.08      The Batswana Enterprises Development Unit (BEDU), also a
department within MCI, was set up in 1972 to promote development of
indigenous small-scale enterprises. Up to 1982 BEDU's program was to
provide factory shells at low rents (in six industrial estates) as well as
financial, technical and marketing assistance to small entrepreneurs. This
assistance was intended to be provided to each enterprise fcr a period of
two years. After that period, enterprises were expected to "graduate" and
no longer need the assistance. A total of 89 small enterprises received
this assistance but most of them remained in the industrial estates until
1981/82, when BEDU initiated a consolidation scheme that phased out poor
performers and graduated the better ones. BEDU was left with 22 firms that
are receiving intensive assistance.  The reorganized BEDU will concentrate
on providing managerial and technical assistance to entrepreneurs inside
and outside its estates, including rural craftsmen through a system of
mobile workshops.
2.09      Many other training and advisory institutions, both Government
and private, are active in Botswana includinig the Business Advisory
Services (BAS) and the Rural Industrial Officer Cadre within MCI, which
provide technical assistance to emerging small entrepreneurs.  They offer a
fairly wide range of services from training to book-keeping advice to
technical advice. However, they tend to be understaffed, work in isolation
from each other and overlap in the type of services they provide, while
some aspects of SSEs development are left uncovered. Particularly
important is the absence of coordination between institutions providing
technical assistance and those providing financial assistance. The



-6-
Government is committed to improve this coordination and has recently
constituted an Industrial Extension Co-ordinating Committee which will
include representatives from all the existing institutions providing
exctension services, the two development financing institutions and the
concerned ministries.  The committee has been asked, among other things, to
make recommendations on the organizational structure of the extension
services in both rural and urban areas, to evaluate adequacy of services
provided and delineate clearly the functions to be performed by the
agencies in rural and urban areas.  The Government has also decided to
merge BAS with BEDU. An uniderstanding was reached at the negotiatiols that
the Bank and the Government would discuss a timetable for the
implementation of the recommendations of the Committee during the Bank's
next industrial mission to Botswana.
2.10      The Ministry of Finance and Development Planning also has a
strong influence on the sector through its administration of investment
incentives under its Financial Assistance Policy Scheme (FAP) (para. 2.14).
Government Objectives and Policies
2.11      Botswana's GDP averaged real growth rates of more than 10% a year
between 1973/74 and 1980/81. The engine for this rapid growth has been the
mining sector which, during the same period, grew at an average rate of 27%
per year. However, Botswana's economic growth based on mineral exports has
had little impact on employment. Two thirds of the active labor force is
still engaged in agriculture; up to 45% of it is under- or unemployed. The
realization that the benefits from rapid growth are not shared by large
segments of the population prompted the Government to review its economic
objectives. Both the Fifth National Development Plan (1979/80 - 1984/85)
and, more recently, the report of the Presidential Commission on Economic
Opportunities (1982) stress the need to identify opportunities for new
employment outside the mining and service sectors and to spread the
benefits of growth in mining more widely and equally than in the past.
These opportunities are to be found in the manufacturing and the
agricultural sectors. In addition, the recent balance of payments crisis
-- brought about by lower export prices for diamonds and copper-nickel, and
the embargo of beef exports by the EEC, due to an outbreak of foot and
mouth disease -- demonstrated the vulnerability of the economy to external
events and the need for a more diversified economic base.
2.12      The strategy adopted by the Government to stimulate growth of the
manufacturing sector focusses on the creation of a climate more favorable
to private investment. This includes renewed encouragement of private
foreign investment as a means of acquiring the necessary capital,
entrepreneurial and technical skills not available in Botswana. Although
the Government expects the private sector to lead the country's industrial
development, the incipient nature of Botswana's industrialization has
required direct Government involvement in industrial production in such
strategic areas as meat products and diamonds. In support of its strategy,
the Government has traditionally provided industrial infrastructure such as
roads, power, water and sites; direct investment services and term capital



- 7 -
to small firms through the National Developmenit Bank (NDB) (since 1963) anld
to larger firms through the Botswana Development Corporation (BDC) (since
1970); as well as information to investors (since 1978) and technical
assistance to small entrepreneurs (since 1972).  Furthermore, the
Government implemented liberal exchange control policies and provided
investment incentives through low corporate taxes and a number of tax
allowances, while limiting price controls to a few basic food items. An
important characteristic of the Government's strategy towards the sector is
that it provides direct assistance to enterprises instead of providing
protection from outside competition to support manufacturing production.
Botswana follows a liberal trade policy allowing goods from other SACU
members, Zimbabwe and Malawi to enter duty free. Although the SACU
countries (including Botswana) have external tariffs, they are generally
low (10% average nominal rate) and goods not produced in SACU countries are
exempt from all duties.
2.13      Despite these measures, industrial investment during the late
1970's remained below expectations. This situation prompted the Government
to commission a number of studies that helped review its policies regarding
inivestment incentives.  In December 1982, the National Assembly approved a
white paper entitled "National Policy on Economic Opportunities" which
outlines the Government's reaction to the recommendations made by the
Investment Climate and Investment Incentives Study (1981) and the Report of
the Presidential Commission on Economic Opportunities. The most important
actions the Government proposed to take to ensure faster industrial growth
include: (a) providing financial assistance particularly to local citizens
to start enterprises that are valuable to Botswana but might not initially
be commercially viable; (b) improving publicity of investment opportunities
in Botswana; (c) providing better assistance to citizens and foreign
investors in their dealings with Government relating to the establishment
of new enterprises; (d) coordinating the small business extension services
and linking them closely to the various financial institutions; and (e)
strengthening the Ministry of Commerce and Industry and shifting its
activities towards support rather than regulation of enterprises. Some of
these actions have materialized into policy schemes anid new agencies.
Others have yet to be implemented.  The two most important actions stemming
from this new strategy are the launching of the Financial Assistance Policy
Scheme (paragraph 2.14) and the creation of the Trade and Investment
Promotion Agency (para. 2.07). The new policy scheme does not include
specific export incentives besides the tariff drawback on imports from
outside the Customs Union granted to exports going outside the Customs
Union. Recently, however, export activities have been stimulated, by the
devaluation of the Pula in response to the devaluation of the South African
Rand. Also, as part of its new strategy towards the sector, the Government
is reducing infrastructure constraints by developing industrial estates in
the three main cities; improving the telephone and telex communications and
the railway system; and increasing power supply with a coal based central
power station (to be completed in 1985). The Governmenit also favors
Botswana's participation in two regional agreements: the Preferential Trade
Area of Eastern and Southern African States and the Southern Africa
Development Coordination Conference, both of which envisage reducing trade
barriers among member countries.

2.14      Investment Incentives.  The Financial Assistance Policy (FAP)
scheme, launched in 1982, is administered by the Ministry of Finance and
Development Planning. The assistance, available to new and expanding
firms, consists of packages of incentives depending on the size of the firm
and its expected economic rate of return. Each package is a combination of
financial incentives including tax holidays, subsidies for unskilled labor,
training grants for off-the-job training, capital grants, and sales
subsidies. The incentives are phased out in five years. A bias towards
small, rural-based enterprises is built into the assistance package. The
response to the program in the first 10 months since its implementation has
been good. Approximately P5 million was committed for assistance and
additional PIO million has been appropriated for FAP in 1983/84. This
scheme has positive features: First, it can improve the competitiveness of
emerging local firms against South African imports without the negative!
eff2cts of tariff protection such as raising the price of manufactures to
local consumers. Second, it is neutral between production for the local
market and exports ensuring that exports will result from relative
advantages and not policy biases. Third, there are indications that it is
influencing new firms in favor of more labor intensive techniques, a
reversal of the distinct bias in favor of capital intensity of the previous
investment incentive based only on taxation allowances. The Government
intends to evaluate the scheme's performance in early 1984.
Development Constraints and Issues
2.15      Manufacturing activities in Botswana face severe constraints,
many of which cannot be solved through policy actions or public sector
programs. First, Botswana suffers from periodic droughts which result in
high cost and unreliability of both electricity and water supply. Second,
its internal market, although growing fast, is still very small (Botswana's
population was less than I million in 1981) and characterized by low
average income levels and scattered location. Although, as part of the
SACU agreement, Botswana's manufactures have free access to a much larger
market (25 million), few firms are able to compete with the more efficient
South African producers in their own market. On the other hand, imports
from the RSA into Botswana present serious problems of competition for
local producers both in terms of quality and prices. Third, because of
Botswana's landlocked position, transport to and from external markets,
other than those in Southern Africa, is slow and expensive.
2.16     Notwithstanding these constraints, several factors make investment
in Botswana more attractive than in other countries of Southern Africa.
First, producers located in Botswana have, in addition to free access to
the markets of South Africa, Zimbabwe, and Malawi, the possibility to
export to other African countries that would not trade with producers
located in the RSA or the "Homelands". Second, it has political and
economic stability including a sound and stable convertible currency with
free remittance of interest and dividends. The Government seeks to enhance
these advantages by adopting the lowest personal taxation (outside the RSA
and the "Homelands") and the lowest corporate income tax outside the



"Romelands". Also, the Government allows domestic producers a 12.5% price
preference over foreign firms whern bidding for public contracts; the
highest local preference in Southern Africa.  In addition, the package of
financial incentives recently introduced is probably the most generous in
the region.
2.17      Manufacturinlg activities in Botswana are seriously limited by the
low skill level of its labor force, the scarcity of local managerial and
technical expertise and the shortage of experieniced entrepreneurs.
Although there has been some progress in the development of local
managerial and technical capabilities (para. 2.05), more needs to be done
in this area and in the area of vocational and technical training. Because
of lack of skills, labor productivity in Botswana tends to be lower than in
the RSA and Zimbabwe, its main competitors in manufacturing productioni. In
some industries, lower wages of Botswana's semi-skilled and unskilled
workers 5/ may compensate for their lower productivity, resulting in lower
unit wage costs in Botswana than in its two more developed neighbours. The
Government's wage policy has in the past operated against this type of
advantage. During the second part of the 1970's the Government steadily
pushed its own wages up, raising the general wage level in the formal
sector and with it unit wage costs. Since 1982, however, the Government
has followed a more realistic policy of wage restraint.
2.18      The central Government has recruited most of the University
Graduates each year since independence, leaving little trainable material
for the parastatals, local government, and the private sector. 6/ Firms
resort to expatriates for these positions usually at considerably higher
cost. The Government is taking various actions to increase the supply of
both secondary and university graduates and has agreed to share the
existing supply. To increase the pool of skilled manpower, the Bank is
financing the training of local people through current and proposed
projects. The Bank-financed First and Second Education Projects (loans
approved inL 1976 and 1980, totaling US$20.5 million) are both helping to
improve vocational and technical education.  The Government and Bank are
discussing an expansion of such training in the proposed Fourth Education
Project.  The recent Bank-finaniced Power and Third Water Supply Projects
also include training components, as well the proposed Family Health
Project. The wider issues of manpower development and training are being
discussed with Government in the context of the current Bank's Economic
Planning and Management Study.
5/  Unskilled and semi-skilled workers in Botswana earn between 55% and 70%
of the wages of their counterparts in Zimbabwe and the RSA.  But,
skilled workers and supervisors earn nearly as much as their peers in
both neighboring countries.
6/  Although university graduates are obliged by the terms of their grants
to work for the Government upon leaving school, some firms are now able
to hire graduates by compensating the Government for part of the
education costs.

Prospects
2.19      The contribution of the manufacturing sector to direct employment
creation is limited.  Even if the rate of growth of manufacturing
employment can be trebled, the sector will still create less than 2,000
jobs a year out of the 13,000 to 15,000 required to keep pace with
population growth 7/. However, the indirect employment effect of
manufacturing growth can be much larger through activities that serve
industry (trade, banking) and through its linkage effects on the informal
sector. Another important justification for Botswana's emphasis on
manufacturinig development is the types of skills it helps to develop in the
local population, ranging from production skills to technological know-how
and managerial and marketing abilities.
2.20      In addition to the role industry can play in employment creation,
there is potential for increased industrial production to substitute
imports and to export to other countries. This would strengthen Botswana's
balance-of-payments. The Government is conducting sector studies to
evaluate this potential in areas such as agroindustries and building
materials, and the scope for establishing supplier industries linked to the
development of the coal and soda-ash deposits as well as to other
Government and mixed enterprises (Botswana Meat Commission, the railways,
etc.). Feasibility studies are also available for a number of potential
projects including a large tannery and a foundry.  The Government is
discussing both projects with interested foreign investors. The extent to
which this potential can be realized and sustained beyond the short scope
of the FAP depends on the ability of the Government to reduce the sector's
constraints in terms of lack of physical and human resources and of
technical knowledge.
Bank Experience and Strategy in the Sector
2.21      Bank involvement in the industrial sector in Botswana has been
through: (i) a US$32.0 million loan approved in 1971 to assist financinlg
the construction of infrastructure facilities in support of a copper/nickel
mining project, and (ii) a first line of credit to the Botswana Development
Corporation (BDC) of US$4.0 million approved in 1974 and fully disbursed.
The IFC participates as a preferential shareholder in BDC. Its
shareholding in 1979 was equivalent to US$375,000; it has recently approved
an increase in its shareholding by US$481,000.
2.22      The Bank's strategy is to help strengthen the institutions
involved in providing development finance, particularly NDB and BDC, and to
help the Government improve an already basically sound policy framework
through policy dialogues (e.g., in the area of human resources development)
between Bank missions and Government officials. The Bank supports
Botswana's strategy of employment generation and economic diversification,
through a more vigorous manufacturing sector.

Study", July 1981.

B. The Mining Sector
2.23      The engine for the rapid growth of GDP since the mid-1970's has
been the mining sector which between 1976/77 and 1980/81 grew at an average
rate of 33% per year. During that period, the contribution of the mining
sector to GDP almost doubled from 14% to 27%. At present, mineral exports
consist mostly of diamonds and copper-nickel. But, by the end of the
decade, Botswana may become a significant exporter of coal, salt and soda
ash of which the country also has abundant deposits.  With a production of
7.7 million carats in 1982 Botswana is one of the major diamond producers
in the world.  Production is in the hands of the De Beers Botswana Mining
Company (Debswana), a joint-venture in which the Government of Botswana and
the South African firm are equal shareholders. The international price of
diamonds fell in mid-1981 reducing the value of Botswana's exports by
almost US$100 million. Exports recuperated in 1982 due to the commenicement
of production in the new mine at Jwaneng, which made possible a large
increase in Botswana's sales quota to the London-based Central Selling
Organization.
2.24      Production of copper-nickel started in 1974 in Selebi-Phikwe.
The owner of the mining complex is a holding company, the Botswana RST
Limited, in which the major shareholders are: AMAX Inc., the Anglo-American
Corporation of South Africa, the Botswana Government, and public
shareholders.  The operating company, Bamangwato Concessions Ltd. (BCL), is
owned by BRST and the Botswana Government. BCL is at present in serious
financial troubles due to earlier technical difficulties and the depressed
international prices of copper and nickel.  The company has gone through
three financial restructurings and has received emergency funds to cover
operating deficits. The financial difficulties of BCL may force the mine
to close even before the ore reserves are estimated to run out early in the
next century. Given these prospects, the Government is considerilng doing a
comprehensive study on the future of the mining community of 30,000 people
of Selebi-Phikwe which the Bank is prepared to consider financing, under a
separate project. Meanwhile, the Bank has indicated to the Goverlnment that
it is willing to provide financing, under the present loan, for a
consultant's review of existing studies prior to determining the need and
scope of a major study (para. 4.02). Despite its financial problems, BCL
is not expected to make credit demands on the Botswana Development
Corporation or the National Development Bank.
C. The Agricultural Sector
Role and Performance
2.25      The contribution of agriculture to GDP has steadily declined from
45% in 1968/69 to 11% in 1980/81, as mining substituted cattle production
as the mainspring of the economy. However, agriculture is still the
largest single sector of the economy in terms of the number of families who



- 12 -
derive a living from it. There are approximately 85,000 traditional farms
operating on the country's tribal lands and 360 commercial farms outside
the tribal lands. In total, over 80% of the population of Botswana lives
in rural areas.
Crop Farming
2.26      The country's ecological conditions are more suitable for cattle
raising than for crop farming because soils are poor and water is scarce.
Nevertheless, there are about 68,500 traditional crop farms cultivating
over 200,000 hectares with food crops such as sorghum, maize, millet and
beans. In years of normal rainfall, local farmers can supply up to 50% of
the country's grain requirements. Even in years of normal rainfall yields
are low, notably among traditional farmers whose yields are on average one
third the yields in commercial farms. The difference in productivity
between both types of farmers reflects differences in the quality of land,
in irrigation, and in farming practices, including the fact that one third
of traditional farmers lack any source of draught power.
Cattle Ranching
2.27      About 80% of the agricultural output in Botswana is from
livestock. Approximately 57,700 traditional cattle farms own 2.5 million
cattle; the rest of the 3 million head herd is owned by 360 freehold
ranchers.  An estimated 80% of the slaughtered cattle is exported, mostly
to the EEC countries where Botswana's beef enters duty free (under the Lome
II agreement). The major constraint in a further increase in beef exports
has been abbattoir capacity which remained static from 1972-82. Until the
proposed abbattoir in Francistown is operational, export slaughter offtake
is limited to BMC's Lobatse plant: other problems such as overgrazing on
the tribal grazing lands, are likely to be eased when additional
slaughtering capacity is installed.
Government Objectives and Policies
2.28      The Government's objectives in the agricultural sector are:
first, to increase agricultural productivity and with it employment and
incomes for 70% of the rural families who depend on farm cropping for their
subsistance and will depend on this activity for the forseeable future;
second, to achieve self-sufficiency in basic grains and vegetables by the
end of the decade; and third, to reduce herd sizes in grazing lands and to
increase cattle offtake rates. The main instrument of Government policy to
achieve its objectives in crop farming is the Arable Lands Development
Program (ALDEP) run by the Ministry of Agriculture. This is a
multi-faceted program covering all aspects of production (research,
extension, credit, input supply, marketing assistance etc.).  Recently, the
credit component has been dropped and more emphasis is being placed on
research and extension, particularly on the development of new systems of
dry land cultivation. Shortage of trained and experienced manpower,
particularly extension agents, limit the effectiveness of this well
designed programme. Also, to stimulate crop production, the Goverlnment



- 13 -
provides a guaranteed market for food grains at annually fixed prices
through the Botswana Agricultural Marketing Board (BAMB).  Recently BAMB
introduced a differential price system to encourage crop production in
deficit areas and started announcing its prices in advance of the planting
season. BAMB's guaranteed buying prices tend to exceed its own selling
prices. Still, imports from the RSA reach grain millers in Botswana at
even lower prices-
2.29      The main ongoing program for the cattle sector is the Tribal
Grazing Lands Program (TGLP) which is aimed at establishing demarcated
commercial leasehold ranches within the tribal grazing lands. The
Government believes that converting to commercial ranching would help to
relieve overstocking on communal grazing areas and encourage increased
off-take rate.   In operation since 1974, the program has proceeded very
slowly. However, the Governmert has recently made some major policy
statements on TGLP clarifying points on compensation for displaced settlers
and on the number of ranches an individual can be allocated. It is
expected that the program may now pick up momentum and achieve its stated
objectives.  The Government is also considering proposals to raise tax on
cattle producers, eliminate subisidies on livestock services, and require
the meat processing industry to finance its future expansion either from
loans or retained earnings. The Bank has been involved in Botswana's
agricultural development through two livestock development projects: (i) a
US$1.65 million loan (IDA) approved in 1972; and (ii) a US$6.5 million loan
approved in 1977. About US$2.4 million of the second loan was on-lent to
the National Development Bank.
D. The Financial Sector
Institutional Structure
2.30      Botswana has a well-established financial sector regulated by the
Bank of Botswana (established in 1975). The sector includes two
Government-owned financial institutions. The National Development Bank
(NDB), established in 1963, is the country's first development bank
providing short, medium and long-term loans to small-scale enterprises in
agriculture, commerce and industry. The Botswana Development Corporation
(BDC) was established in 1970 to identify and promote investment
opportunities in the modern business sector. Most of BDC's investments is
in the form of wholly-owned subsidiaries and joint ventures in a wide range
of activities including industry, agriculture, tourism and real estate.
Although BDC has up to now concentrated on large-scale projects, it is now
contemplating the creation of a subsidiary to redirect some of its lending
to small and medium enterprises. There are three commercial Banks:
Barclays Bank of Botswana Limited and Standard Bank Botswana Limited, both
incorporated in Botswana during 1975 as wholly owned subsidiaries of their
parent British Banks; and the Bank of Credit and Commerce International,
owned by Middle Eastern interests, which started operations in November



- 14 -
1982. The commercial banks have not been significantly involved in the
past in financing small enterprises, with the exception of Barclay's Bank
which in 1975 started an SSE financing scheme (restricted to Batswana
citizens) jointly with BDC. While this scheme did not make much headway at
that time, BDC is now revitalizing the scheme through its proposed
subsidiary (para. 3.25) and extending its scope to cover SSE financing by
other commercial banks as well. Another financial agency, the Financial
Services Company of Botswana, was formed in 1974 by NDB, BDC and the two
older commercial banks to provide hire-purchase finance, industrial leasing
arid medium term lending. There are other specialized financial institution
such as the Botswana Cooperative Bank, the Botswana Building Society, the
Post Office Savings Bank, two insurance companies and two brokers with
international connections. In terms of size, the commercial banks dominate
thle financial sector. The number and variety of financial institutions
apears adequate to meet the current needs of the country.
2.31       Up to now there has been no significant joint financing between
the commercial banks and the development banks.  This may change in the
future as a result of the Government's stated interest to promote
complementarity between Governiment and private sector banks. For that
purpose the Government proposes to establish a Banking Consultative
Committee under the chairmanship of the Bank of Botswania with the task of
jointly adopting guidelines for the development of banking services. The
wide range of financial services offered by these institutions appear to be
adequate for the needs of the economy.
Resource Mobilization and Credit Allocation
2.32       In the period 1980-1982 total commercial bank deposits increased
from P121 million to P202 million, an average growth rate of nearly 14% in
real terms. This growth represents a considerable success in mobilizing
domestic savings, in a country where wealth is not traditionally held in
monetary forms. As of June 1983, demand deposits accounted for 50% of all
deposits, short-term notice deposits for 29% and savings for 21%.
2.33       Lending to manufacturing remained a modest 4 or 5 percent of
all commercial bank lending until the second quarter of 1983, when it
reached nearly 8% compared to 13% for mining, 9% for agriculture and 28%
for trade.
2.34       High inflation and balance of payment problems obliged the
Government to increase interest rates in 1981 and again in 1982. The prime
lending rate was increased to 10.5% in July 1981 and to 14.5% in May 1982.
At the same time, the Government introduced a statutory ceiling of 8% on
credit expansion to the private sector, which was subsequently rised to 15%
in the light of improved export prospects. As a result of these measures,
commercial bank lending to the private sector stagnated during the second
quarter of 1982 8/, but recovered in the last quarter. During this
8/ The most affected sectors were mining and services.



- 15 -
period, commercial lending to manufacturing continued largely unaffected
increasing from P4.6 million by December 1980 to 5.4 million by December
1981 and to P6.9 million by December 1982, an average real growth rate of
over 10 % per year. But, lending from Government institution such as BDC
and NDB did respond to the reduction in loanable funds.  For these two
institutions, commercial and industrial lending in 1981 and 1982 was below
the 1980 level even in nominal terms. In the second quarter of 1983, once
the credit ceilings were removed, commercial bank lending to manufacturilng
rose to P11.8 million, a real increase of over 60% above the December 1982
level. The expansion in bank lending to the sector reflects, besides the
removal of credit ceilings, an increase in manufacturing activities
generated by the incelntives scheme adopted in 1982. Excess liquidity in
the banking systems, however, remained high reaching P66 million in June
1983.
2.35      The commercial banks normally lend short-term for working capital
purposes. The two development financing institutions (BDC and NDB) are the
major sources of long term lending. These institutions have to rely partly
on the Government and the multilateral financial institutions for resources
for their medium and long-term loans. BDC has already identified
investment opportunities and is going ahead with an investment program of
P32 million covering FY83-86. Considering the level of its operations
during the past 3 years and its efforts to diversify into non-agricultural
activities, NDB's commitments during the next 2 years are expected to
exceed P42 million. The Bank funds would finance about 18% of BDC's
commitments and about 11% of NDB's commitments during FY84-86.
Inflation and Interest Rates
2.36      Inflation rates in Botswana reflect, to some extent, price trends
in the RSA, Botswanats main source of imported goods and services. After
several months of moderate price increases, inflation in Botswana
accelerated during the last two quarters of 1980 and continued rising
during the first half of 1981. The change in the cost of living index
reached a peak of 18.5% per annum in May 1981. Since then, the inflation
rate declined steadily reflecting the success of the Government measures to
control demand growth (devaluation, wage freeze and higher interest rates),
and the effects of the RSA's austerity program. Botswana's inflation
performance continued improving during 1982. Accordingly, the twelve-month
average increase in the cost of living index fell from 16.3% in 1981 to
11.5% in 1982. Botswana's National Accounts projections assume an
inflation rate of 10% per annum between 1983 and 1985.
2.37      Real interest rates in Botswana were negative until early 1981,
when bank rates were increased several times in order to take account of
inflation and rising interest rates abroad, as well as to bring the demand
for credit more in line with the reduction in loanable funds (paragraph
2.34). Real interest rates became highly positive in 1982 when further
increases in bank rates coincided with a sharp deceleration in inflation.
The prime lending rate remained at 14.5% from May 1982 to February 1983
when it was lowered to 13%, still above the 12.4% inflation rate for that
quarter. The Government intends to keep interest rates positive.

III. THE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES
A. Botswana Development Corporation
Objectives and Role
3.01      The Botswana Development Corporation was established in April
1970 as a wholly Government-owned company. Its goals were "to promote and
facilitate the economic development of Botswana, to identify opportunities
for development of new and existing industrial, commercial and agricultural
business undertakings", either on its owIn or in partnership with other
local or foreign investors and to provide them with appropriate assistanLce,
including financial and management support. BDC is not a typical DFC, in
as much as its major role has been that of a promotional institution which,
due to the lack of local entrepreneurs, has taken strong entrepreneurial
initiatives in identifying and establishing projects through wholly-owned
or joint-venture subsidiaries, the latter with foreign participation. With
a few exceptions, it has since inception promoted and/or invested in 45
medium and large scale enterprises (including six enterprises since
disposed of to private investors or Batswana institutions). These
investments cover a wide variety of sectors viz, commercial farming,
commerce and industry, tourism and transportation, property development and
financial services. Most of these activities have been carried out through
subsidiaries.  It has also attracted foreign investors and established
joint-venture subsidiaries. While the number of its operations over the
past five years has averaged 20 per annum most of these have been repeated
operations to existing subsidiaries for expansion, modernization etc. It
has performed its role successfully and has developed into a mature and
financially strong institution with sound policies and procedures, good
management and a satisfactory staff development program. In order to
increase its developmental impact, it is planning to promote and implement
a number of projects in productive sectors; the Bank considers the plans to
be appropriate.
Capital, Ownership and Board
3.02      BDC's paid-in capital, as of June 30, 1983, was P5,145,000 of
which P3,945,000 was in ordinary shares of P1 each, all owned by the
Botswana Government and P1,200,000 in 8.5% cumulative redeemable non-voting
preference shares held by FMO (P600,000), DEG (P300,000) and IFC
(P300,000). The three preference shareholders were invited by the
Government in 1979 to participate in BDC's capital and to take seats on the
Board; their participation was intended to strengthen the expertise of the
Board and to assist BDC in attracting foreign investment to Botswana.
3.03      BDC's Board, chaired by the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry
of Finance and Development Planning, consists of eleven members, five
representing the Government, three from the private sector (nominated by



- 17 -
the Government) and three representing the institutional preference
shareholders. The Board is required to meet four times a year. The Board
has constituted an Executive Committee, consisting of all local BDC Board
members which can meet at short notice to take decisions on urgent
matters.  The Committee's decisions are required to be reported to the
Board. The members take active interest in the deliberations of the Board
which conducts its affairs in a business like manner and takes decision on
each proposal on its economic and commercial merits, with due regard to the
overall, long-term economic interests of and benefits to Botswana.
Organization and Management
3.04      BDC's organization chart is given in Annex 2.  All work relating
to project identification, promotion, appraisal, and implementation up to
commissioning stage is carried out by the Project Development Department,
which is headed by a Manager directly reporting to the General Manager.
Supervision of existing investments is carried out by the Management
Department (divided into seven divisions according to sectors of the
economy) which is under the control of three Divisional Managers reporting
to the Deputy General Manager. This department is also responsible for the
management and proper development of BDC's subsidiaries. The Finance,
Personnel and Administration Department, which is headed by the Financial
Controller, is responsible for bookkeeping and treasury functions, and
personnel administration. The Financial Controller is assisted by a
qualified Chief Accountant. The latter also provides advice on accounting
and financial matters to BDC's wholly-owned subsidiaries.
3.05      All management positions in BDC, with the exception of the Deputy
General Manager, are held by expatriates. The General Manager and a
Divisional Manager are funded under Dutch technical assistance grants
whereas the other expatriates are directly employed by BDC. Due to the
extreme shortage of qualified and experienced Batswana, most of the
managerial positions in BDC will continue to be occupied by expatriates for
a number of years. With a few exceptions, expatriates also occupy key
positions in BDC subsidiaries. BDC's management is dedicated and
competent. In order to improve the proportion of Batswana citizens in
management positions, BDC has drawn up a program for staff development
under which all management positions in the Project Development Department
and the Management Department would be filled by Batswana citizens by the
end of mid-1988. This program is discussed below.
Staffing, Staff Development and Training
3.06      As of June 30, 1983, BDC had a professional staff of 23
(excluding subsidiaries) of which 10 were expatriates. BDC has made good
progress in recent years in recruiting Batswana graduates for professional
positions in BDC itself as well as in some of its subsidiaries. Of the six
Batswana professional staff in the Project Development Department, three
project officers are being sponsored by BDC for higher education in Canada
and U.K. and the remaining three (assistant project officers) are scheduled
to undergo courses in finance, accounting and economics at the Botswana



- 18 -
Polytechnic. Four Batswana, two presently working as assistant accountants
in the Finance Department and two in subsidiaries, are now preparing for
level 2 examinations of the Association of Accounting Technicians of U.K.
BDC appointed an expatriate (having project appraisal experience in a
development bank) in the Project Development Department as a Training
Officer, to provide on-the-job training to Batswana staff. Overall, BDC's
staff training and development programs are satisfactory.
Policies and Procedures
3.07      Policies.  In June 1982, BDC's Board adopted a new statement of
"Investment Policy and Procedures" (Annex 3). This statement amplifies the
statement adopted by BDC 's Board in June 1974 following the appraisal of
the Bank's first loan to BDC. The salient features of the revised policy
statement are:
(i) reiteration of the policy that investment decisions will be based
on sound appraisal criteria including technical feasibility,
economic viability and financial soundness of projects;
(ii)  economic rate of return to be at last equal to the opportunity
cost of capital;
(iii)  appropriate restrictions on exposure in individual projects;
(iv)  BDC not to involve itself normally in management of financed
projects;
(v) BDC to disinvest its mature investments at commercial prices,
preferably to Batswana citizens; and
(vi)  BDC to protect itself against exchange risk and to charge market
rates for its funds and services.
3.08      Procedures.  While BDC has all along carried out adequate
appraisal of investment proposals and closely supervised its investments,
it has only recently prepared an Operations Manual in which its appraisal
procedures are formally elaborated. The Manual is a well prepared document
containing (i) guidelines for preparation of proposals for the Board, (ii)
standard loan conditions and, (iii) the procedure for handling disbursement
requests. BDC 's Board at its March 1983 meeting approved the creation of
a post of Corporate Development Officer for a period of two years to
prepare procedures for all BDC's departments, as well as those governing
subsidiaries' relationships with BDC and with other subsidiaries etc. The
laying down of procedures in these areas will provide adequate guidance to
the young Batswana staff who over the years will have to assume higher
responsibilities and will also provide guidelines to the new expatriates
who may replace some of the existing expatriates in BDC.



- 19 -
3.09      The appraisal guidelines provided in the Operations Manual are
comprehensive.  The lending criteria are based on the guidelines contained
in BDC's statement of "Investment Policy and Procedures" (paragraph 3.07),
particularly the provisions relating to maximum BDC exposure in a project
and the estimation of the financial and economic rates of return.
Agreement was reached with BDC at loan negotiations that it will calculate
economic rate of return for all subprojects using more than $130,000
equivalent from Bank funds and that this return will not be less than 10%.
3.10      BDC closely supervises its projects whose executing agencies are
required to submit quarterly progress reports and proforma financial
statements, summaries of which are presented to BDC Board for information
at each meeting. While BDC's real estate subsidiaries are controlled and
managed by the Manager of the Property Division of the Management
Department, other subsidiaries have independent managers who have been
given reasonable autonomy to manage their affairs. BDC's management staff
usually constitutes the Board of wholly-owned subsidiaries; in case of
joint-venture subsidiaries, the management is usally with the foreign
minority investor but here, too, BDC's management staff have seats on their
Board. BDC provides accounting services, at reasonable fees, to six
subsidiaries which cannot either maintain their own accounts at their
locations (the two commercial farms) or which are too small to afford
separate accounting staff.
3.11      Some of BDC procedures, particularly those relating to its
relationship with its subsidiaries have continued to be a matter of concern
to the Bank. During its early years BDC established a number of
wholly-owned subsidiaries, particularly the property companies, with a
nominal capital of P2, and made loans on a demand basis without fixed
amortization schedules to finance their capital investments. This was done
(i) to take advantage of the tax regulations in force at the time, (ii) to
allow BDC flexibility in financial management through centralization of
cash flow from the subsidiaries; and (iii) to cut down on administration
costs during the early stages of their development. At the same time this
practice resulted in the subsidiaries having an unsatisfactory capital
structure (excessive debt and financial charges) and insufficient autonomy
to manage their financial resources. Consistent with Bank advice, BDC has
recently provided its non-property subsidiaries with adequate capital and
has established fixed amortization schedules for all its loans to these
subsidiaries for capital expenditure. However, BDC still does not propose
to have fixed amortization schedules for its property subsidiaries (except
two sub-projects financed under our first loan) for the reason that it
finds it more convenient and efficient administratively to control property
subsidiaries centrally and not leave surplus cash balances with them. This
position is acceptable to the Bank.
3.12      Procurement.  BDC's procurement procedures are adequate; its
customers procure goods on the basis of competitive quotations, giving due
weight to quality, after-sales service, delivery schedules etc.



- 20 -
3.13      Disbursement of funds is made either direct to suppliers against
invoices or in reimbursement of expenses already incurred by borrowers.
Disbursement procedures are adequate.
3.14      Audit.  BDC's accounts as well as those of its subsidiaries,
associated companies and other borrowers are audited annually by a locally
based audit firm of international repute. Whereas BDC's auditors have in
the past been giving adequate explanations and notes for various items
appearing in the company's financial statements, they have not been
producing the audit reports along the guidelines in the "Illustrative Form
of Audit Reports for DFCs". An understanding was reached with BDC
that starting with the closing of the financial year end of June 1983, the
audited accounts will conform to the "Illustrative Form" as far as
possible. Since the audited accounts reflect the position of the company
(BDC) as well as the consolidated position of the Group, the Bank has
agreed that BDC submit the audited accounts within six mQnths of the close
of its financial year.
3.15      Interest Rate.  BDC has traditionally lent money to its
subsidiaries and other borrowers at 0-3% above the prime rate in Botswana,
which is presently 13% p.a., but has made exceptions in case of a few
"small sub-commercial projects" (namely, projects which do not yield a
commercial rate of return but have economic benefits), two agricultural
operations and a few other operations which BDC thought could not sustain
-normal rates during the early years of their establishment. However, over
81% of the BDC loan portfolio is at 14.5% or above. Given the present
inflation rate of about 11.5%, the interest rate is positive in real
terms. It is also in line with the interest rate charged by commercial
banks in Botswana. BDC is pragmatic about the interest rate charged on its
loans and has been adjusting the rate in the light of the economic
situation in the country. At the loan negotiations it was agreed that
during the execution of the project BDC will annually review with the Bank
the interest rates charged in its lending operations. An understanding was
also reached that this review will take account of the inflation rate, the
interest rate structure prevailing in Botswana, and the spread required to
enable BDC to cover its costs, provide for possible losses and generate a
reasonable profit.
3.16      Foreign Exchange Risk.  On the first Bank loan, BDC passed the
foreign exchange risk to its sub-borrowers. Since all of them were
wholly-owned BDC subsidiaries, the risk had to be ultimately borne by BDC.
However, since the Pula has been a stable currency, BDC made some exchange
gains. In August 1980, the Government worked out a formula (Annex 13) for
providing protection to BDC, among other parastatals, against exchange
fluctuation risks for its existing as well as future foreign currency
borrowings whereby 91.75% of the risk is borne by the Government and the
remaining 8.25% by BDC. This arrangement is satisfactory.

Operations and Portfolio
3.17      Operations.  The range of BDC's promotional and financing
activities is very wide covering industry, commerce, agriculture, tourism,
financial services, transport, industrial estates and residential and
commercial properties. An analysis of the operations during the last five
years appears in the Basic Data. The manufacturing sector investments
include breweries, furniture workshops garment factories, and a concrete
products enterprise. In agriculture, BDC subsidiaries have turned largely
unused land into farmland which is currently producing cotton, maize,
wheat, citrus and vegetables. Investments in the tourism sector include
hotels in the main centers in Botswana and help develop tourism in remote
areas which have considerable potential for attracting tourists. Transport
sector investments include the national airline and a successful car rental
franchise.  In an environment where private entrepreneurship was virtually
non-existent, BDC did a commendable job during the early years of its
establishment in setting up a number of enterprises through wholly-owned
subsidiaries and in acting as a catalyst to attract foreign investors to
Botswana.
3.18      By mid-1975 BDC had established 20 subsidiaries, of which 17 were
wholly-owned and 3 joint-ventures with foreign investors. It also took
minority positions in 11 other companies. BDC could not keep up the
tempo of project promotion in later years due to the inordinate amount of
management time needed in project supervision. In case of wholly-owned
subsidiaries, which needed independent management, BDC had to locate and
recruit expatriate managers every few years on expiration of their
contracts and provide the companies with policy guidance etc. Furthermore,
BDC had to pay particular attention to salvaging two subsidiaries 9/ whose
continued poor performance (1974-78), due to mismanagement, had created
financial problems of a magnitude which were threatening BDC's own
financial soundness.
3.19      The economic impact of BDC's operations has been significant,
although not always quantitatively measurable. Apart from creating
production/service facilities in a number of sectors in the economy through
28 subsidiaries, 16 sub-3ubsidiaries and 10 other enterprises, BDC
operations have helped create over 2,600 direct jobs for Batswana citizens
at an average cost per job of about US$18,000. Indirect employment created
by industrial and commercial enterprises (not assisted by BDC) located in
the BDC-owned industrial estate in Gaborone are estimated at about 2,500.
Foreign exchange earnings from crop exports from a farm in Tuli Bloc (North
Eastern Botswana) and the two hotels managed by a subsidiary were estimated
at US$500,000 and US$150,000 respectively in 1982.
9/ The Prinz-Brau Brewery - since renamed Kgalagadi Breweries - originally
a joint venture with a German company and the Hotel Management company
responsible for maniaging the President Hotel in Gaborone and the Bosele
Hotel in Selebi-Phikwe.  BDC was able to turn around the fortunes of
these companies by replacing the management and minority shareholder of
the brewery by a more competent partner and by selling 40% of its
shareholdings in the Hotel Management company to a professional company
and concluding with the latter a management contract.



- 22 -
3.20      Because of the concentration of the country's population in the
East and North East, most BDC projects are located in these areas with
Gaborone claiming the lion's share, followed by Francistown and
Selebi-Phikwe. BDC has not so far made any conscious effort to disperse
its projects but will have to consider this seriously in view of the water
shortage in Gaborone and the need to diversify the economic and employment
base of Selebi- Phikwe, which is threatened by a possible closure of the
copper/nickel mine by the end of the decade 10/.
3.21      Apart from direct project promotion and financing, BDC helped set
up the Partnership for Productivity (Botswana) Ltd. (PFP), a non-profit
institution whose guarantee shares have been assumed by BDC. PFP designs,
develops and operates Batswana-staffed programs to assist small-scale
Batswana entrepreneurs, particularly by providing assistance in start-up,
management consultancy, accounting etc. BDC also provided some assistance
in the initial stages to the Botswana Technology Center, which was set up
with the assistance of London-based Intermediate Technology Development
Group and which carries out appropriate technology research.
3.22      A project completion report on the first loan to BDC prepared in
September 1982 concluded that BDC's performance in achieving the objectives
the Bank had set at the appraisal of the first loan (institution building,
project promotion with a view to creating employment opportunities for
Batswana citizens, and providing subsidiaries with autonomy and a
reasonable financial structure) had been mixed and somewhat slow. Past BDC
management ascribed this slow progress to the excessive attention it had to
pay to set BDC's ailing subsidiaries on proper footing.
3.23      While the management's contention is indisputable, the fact
remains that BDC's developmental activities stagnated after 1975; the
number of assisted enterprises ranged between 32 and 34 during FY76-FY80
and the amount of loan approvals averaged only about P1.1 million a year.
Even this level of loan approvals somewhat overstates BDC's development
financing activities in as much as it includes approvals of working capital
finance to BDC subsidiaries; as a conglomerate operating multi-sectorally
and as a holding company, BDC has to support its subsidiaries when they run
into cash flow problems. BDC has not kept separate figures for these two
types of financing but it informed the mission that a significant
proportion of these approvals was for providing working capital to its
subsidiaries. The mission obtained BDC's assurance that as from the fiscal
year beginning July 1, 1983, it would keep separate statistics for the two
types of financing activities.
:3.24     In an effort to speed up the utilization of the Bank's first line
of credit, and to redirect a part of the Bank Loan towards labour intensive
activities, BDC participated in a scheme jointly with Barclays Bank of
Botswana to provide a partial credit guarantee (50%) for losses on SSE
10/ A component of US$200,000 is being included in this loan to provide for
consultancy to review studies relevant to the options available to the
declining mining community of Selebi-Phikwe (paras. 2.24 and 4.02).



- 23 -
loans made by Barclays Bank to Batswana citizens and to reimburse Barclays
up to about 70% of disbursements.  It was expected that the scheme would
benefit 390 entrepreneurs and create about 975 jobs at an average cost per
job of $1,400. However, due to excess liquidity of the banking system and
the problems associated with disbursement of the Bank loan in the then hard
currencies only 16 SSEs were financed under the Bank loan.
3.25      The induction of a new management team in BDC in 1980 has led to
adoption of policies, procedures and initiatives which address the problems
and inadequacies in BDC's operations and institution building effort
discussed above. There was a significant increase in the level of its
approvals during FY81, mainly due to purchase of a commercial farm,
expansion of the President Hotel in Gaborone and substantial capital
expenditure on development of the Broadhurst Industrial Estate in
Gaborone. BDC is, once again, stepping up its activities to an appropriate
level. Durinig FY83, BDC approved loans and/or equity investments in six
new projects and is going ahead with a substantial investment program for
1984-86 which is consistent with Botswana's development plan and priorities
and in line with growth prospects for Botswana's economy. It has also
carried out significant improvements in its operational procedures
(paragraphs 3.08 and 3.11). In order to provide assistance to small-scale
Batswana enterprises, its Board has approved a proposal for setting up a
subsidiary which will provide the types of assistance not available from
the other existing institutions viz, equity investments, credit guarantees
etc. BDC has also revived the BDC/Barclays Bank guarantee scheme and is
planning to extend its coverage to other commercial banks.
3.26      In order to mobilize the savings of Batswana citizens for
investment in profitable enterprises, BDC's Board has recently approved the
establishment of an investment Trust to which BDC would divest some of its
mature and profitable investments. Batswana citizens who subscribe to the
shares of the Trust would qualify for dividends/profit distribution from
the earnings of the Trust's investments. The Government of Botswana has
agreed to tax exemptions of BDC shares to the trust and from the trust to
the public. Consultants are now preparing details of the trust and
launching of the trust is set for early 1984.
3.27      Portfolio.  The sectoral distribution of BDC's portfolio, which
remained highly skewed towards property development until about 1980, has
since improved considerably. As analysis of the portfolio as of June 30,
1983, is given in Annex 4. As of this date, investments in property (which
stood at 82% of the portfolio in 1974), were 37% 11/ of the portfolio,
followed by tourism and transport (32%), agriculture (18%), industry and
commerce (12%) and financial services (1%). BDC's investments in the
property sector involve industrial estates, commercial buildings, and
residential buildings (including staff housing in Gaborone and in the two
commercial farms in Talana and Seleka). BDC made these investments to meet
the pressing need for land and buildings for industrial and commercial
11/ This proportion also includes substantial revaluations of property
companies carried out in 1981 and 1982.



- 24 -
enterprises and for housing its own staff and also to reduce the proportion
of expatriate ownership of such land and buildings. Since BDC is allowed
to sell such properties only to citizens or Batswana-owned companies, its
progress in this area has been slow; it has so far disposed of only one
office building (to NDB) and a few houses to citizens. Responding to the
Bank's advice to reduce its excessive investments in the property sector,
BDC has confirmed that its present policy is not to invest further in
residential properties in Gaborone, except for some necessary low-cost
housing for its junior staff which they, in turn, could buy from BDC.
Residential properties not occupied by BDC staff are all up for sale to
citizen buyers. Since most BDC residential properties are in blocks and
since there is no sectional title (condominion) law in Botswana, disposal
of such properties has been found difficult. BDC is investigating a scheme
of sectional shareholdings. In the future, BDC will consider investment in
housing only if absolutely needed for the operation of an industry or a
commercial farm.
3.28      Because of the preponderance of subsidiaries in BDC's portfolio,
over 56% of the portfolio represents equity investments. There has been a
substantial increase in BDC's net equity investment portfolio, from P2.3
million as of June 30, 1981 to P11.4 million as of June 30, 1983; most of
the increase (P6.2 million) resulted from the revaluation of seven property
companies, the remainder (P2.9 million) representing four new investments
and improvement of the capital structure of three subsidiaries.
3.29      An analysis of the performance of BDC investments outstanding as
of June 30, 1983 is presented in Annex 5. Over 96% of BDC's investments
are in its subsidiaries. Their overall performance is good; a review of
their FY83 performance is given below. As of June 30, 1983 out of twenty
six subsidiaries, twenty two were operating; of the latter fourteen made
profits of P4.1 million in FY83, five incurred losses totalling P267,000,
and results of three others were not available. During FY83, BDC received
a dividend income of P1,375,000, representing about 20% return on its net
equity investments of P7 million in FY82, as compared to a return of 25% in
the previous year. The decline is due to a significant increase in the
amount of equity investments resulting from revaluation of property
subsidiaries' assets.  Most dividend income was received from the joint
venture subsidiaries (P958,000 representing a return of over 46%) and from
associated and other companies (P417,000 or 142% of equity investments in
these companies).
3.30      The loss making subsidiaries were two property companies which
incurred small losses due to excessive debt, a small-scale enterprise, a
hotel company and a furniture company in Gaborone. BDC is negotiating the
sale of one of the two loss making property subsidiaries; the performance
of the second is linked with the economic revival of the mining community
of Selebi-Phikwe. The hotel in Gaborone was completed in FY82 and its
prospects of profitability are good. BDC has informed us that the
prospects of the furniture company are good. One of BDC's wholly owned
subsidiaries runs the national airline, Air Botswana, and its losses in the



- 25 -
past have been a matter of some concern to the Bank.  Responding to the
Bank's concerns regarding the possibility of Air Botswana's continued
losses and the Bank's proposal to commission a study of its financial
prospects, the Government stated that two studies on the airline's
operations had recently been completed. Following these studies, the
Government had decided to reinforce its intention for Air Botswana to
operate oni commercial principles. At the negotiations the Governmenat also
agreed to meet any losses incurred by BDC in the unlikely event that
uneconomic routes or other uneconomic actions were imposed on the airline
by the Government. Furthermore, BDC recently carried out a reorganization
of two of its former subsidiaries in the aviation business, Air Lease which
owned the aircrafts and leased them to the airline, and Air Botswana which
operated the airline. Whereas in the past Air Botswana was making modest
losses, Air Lease continued to make small profits.  This reorganization,
which would put the performance of the airline operationi into proper
perspective, involved the setting up of a new subsidiary, Air Botswana
Holdings (Pty) Ltd., of which Air Botswana itself would be a wholly-owned
subsidiary; the former would own and lease the aircraft and the latter
would operate it.  In the future the combined performance of these two
enterprises would be reflected in the financial results of Air Botswana
Holdings (Pty) Ltd.  The Government also stated that the airline's
prospects are expected to improve considerably as South African Airlines'
scheduled flights between Johannesburg and Gaborone have been taken over by
Air Botswana as from June 1983 and the latter is considering re-opening the
profitable Lusaka route. The Government and BDC are hopeful that in the
foreseeable future Air Botswana would break even on its operations. Even
if the airline were to incur modest losses, their impact on BDC's
profitability is not expected to be significant in as much as BDC as a
holdinig company is allowed tax credits for losses incurred by its
subsidiaries. The Government's declaration of intent and Woimmitments, as
stated above, are satisfactory.
3.31       While some of BDC's subsidiaries have incurred modest losses, the
overall quality of BDC's portfolio is in good shape. BDC carefully reviews
the financial prospects of its investments at the close of each year anld
makes adequate provisions for possible bad debts. As of June 30, 1983,
these provisions amounted to P955,000, of which P731,000 were against
equity investments (over 6% of the equity portfolio) and P224,000 against
loans (2.5% of the loan portfolio).
3.32       Because of the extremely limited number of private Batswana
investors, BDC's progress in disinvesting some of its mature investments
has been slow. However, in FY83 it was able to dispose of its inivestments
in a property subsidiary in Selebi-Phikwe, a real estate agency subsidiary
and a property mainteaance subsidiary in Gaborone.  BDC's revised policy
statement (para. 3.07 (v)) requires it to endeavour to dispose of its
mature investments in successful enterprises, at commercial prices,
preferably to Batswana citizens. The proposed establishment of an
Investment Trust (para. 3.26) is expected to help spur this divestiture
process.



- 26 -
Resources
3.33      As of June 30, 1983, BDC resources consisted of its paid-in
capital of P5.1 million of which P1.2 million represents 8.5% preference
shares of P1 each held by FMO (600,000), DEG (300,000) and IFC (300,000),
reserves and retained earniings of P9.4 million, 7.25% IBRD loan equivalent
of P2.0 million (still outstanding out of the US$4 million loan), two
Botswana Government loans aggregating P9.2 million (P2.5 million at 8%
repayable by 1999 and P6.7 million at 10% repayable over 25 years
commencing April 1984), and an EIB loan equivalent of P1.2 million.
F'inancial Condition
3.34      Annexes 6(a) -6(c) show BDC's financial statements and financial
ratios 1979-1983 (and projections for 1984-1988).  The balance sheets
reflect stagnation of portfolio during 1979-80, mainly due to intensive
attention paid by BDC management in salvaging two of its subsidiaries
(para. 3.18). BDC investments more than doubled between FY80 and FY82.
Major increases took place in equity investments, partly due to revaluation
of the fixed assets of some of BDC's property subsidiaries. Other
investments were financed out of increases in the paid-in capital
(including P1.2 million contributed by IFC, DEG and FMO), Government loan
and internal cash generation.  BDC has traditionally maintained a sound
liquidity position.
3.35      BDC's financial results have varied widely over the last five
years but the performance has been consistently strong.  BDC's net profits
as percentage of average equity averaged 13.5% per annum during FY79-83.
Its long-term debt equity ratio improved from an already conservative level
of 1.1:1 in FY79 to 0.5:1 in FY83. While BDC has regularly paid dividends
at 8.5% on its preferred shares, it declared a dividend of 8.5% on all its
shares for the first time out of its FY81 profits. It did not pay any
dividends on ordinary shares out of its FY82 profits as the Government,
which is the sole ordinary shareholder, asked BDC to retain the earnings
for its future investment needs.
Prospects
3.36      Operational Strategy.  BDC's new management team since its
induction in 1980 has been active in evaluating BDC's past performance and
suggesting new initiatives to its Board.  In March 1982, BDC adopted an
operational strategy focussing on develomental impact of its operations,
encouraging increased citizen participation in viable ventures, development
of Batswana staff and their training to assume higher responsibilities .in
the future and development of financial discipline in an arms-length
relationship with BDC subsidiaries. These strategies have the support of
the Government and are appropriate. BDC has already started implementing
them.



- 27 -
3.37      Forecast Operations.  BDC intends to expand its activities
considerably over the next five years. Its Board approved an overall
investment program of P55 million covering the period 1983-87.  Reviewing
BDC's project pipeline, including projects under promotion, the mission
estimated that BDC could undertake an investment program of P32.3 million
during FY84-86; a break-down of these projected investments is given
below. During FY83, BDC's approvals amounted to P10.1 million (loans P4.3
million and equity investments P5.8 million). Given its projected
financial resources, BDC has the staffing capability to implemenit an
investment program of this dimension.
Investment Program in P million

32.3           100
3.38        About 60% of the approvals are likely to be in the directly
productive enterprises, 23% in development of industrial estates and
factory shells and only 13% in commercial and residential property. About
P1.1 million, or 4% of the proposed investmenit program, will provide
assistance to small-scale enterprises, particularly those owned by
Batswana (para. 3.25). BDC estimates that its proposed investment program
will assist about 40 medium-size and large projects and over 50 small-scale
enterprises. The projects would include those promoted and financed wholly
by BDC, joint-venture subsidiaries with foreign investors, as well as
projects sponsored by private entrepreneurs, both local and foreign, in
which BDC would either be a minority shareholder or only a lender.  The
above investment program will contribute to a substantial shift in the
composition of BDC portfolio away from property inivestments and towards
investments in productive sectors.
3.39      Resource Requirements.  BDC's resources position, which shows a
financing gap of P2.2 million as at June 30, 1983, appears in the Basic
Data.  In order to cover this gap as well as to finance its FY83-86
investment program of about P32 million, BDC proposes a series of actions.
It will increase its share capital by P6 million, of which P2.8 million
will be in the form of cumulative redeemable non-voting and
non-participating preference shares to be subscribed by IFC (P500,000), DEG
(P500,000), FMO (P1 million) and CDC (P800,000), the remaining amount being



- 28 -
subscribed by the Government in ordinary shares. IFC and the other
preference shareholders had initially agreed with BDC and the Government
that the coupon rate on these shares would be 12% and on this basis IFC
Board approved the investment in May 1983. BDC has now come up with the
proposal that it would assume the exchange risk on the new investments in
preference shares by the above-named institutions by guaranteeing that, on
redemption (over 5 years beginning after the 10th year) of the shares, the
shareholders will receive their investment in the currency and in the
amount it was originally made. These shares will still be subscribed in
Pula and the dividends paid in Pula. In view of this BDC has suggested a
10.5% coupon rate on these shares; lFC has approved the change but the
other preference shareholders have yet to approve it. In the event of this
proposal being accepted by BDC Board and the preference shareholders, BDC
intends to make provisions for any foreign exchange losses as part of its
annual review of loss provisions. BDC is also expecting loan funds
amounting to about P20 million from EIB (about P4 million), IBRD (over P6
million) and the Government (PIO million) and is expected to generate cash
of over P9 million from its operations during this period.
3.40      Projected Financial Position.  BDC's projected financial
statements for FY84-88 are attached as Annex 6 (a)-6(c) and the financial
ratios as Annex 6(d). These projections, which show a good financial
position for BDC assume a moderate improvement in world economy, and the
drought not affecting project implementation to any sizeable extent.
Increased revenues are likely to come from increased dividends and interest
on loans. Administrative costs are expected to decline as a percentage of
average assets from 8.7% in FY83 to 2.6% in FY88. The financial charges
,are forecast to increase from P0.4 million in FY83 to P3.2 million in FY88
reflecting the larger volume of BDC's borrowings. Net income is projected
Lo show an average return on share capital of about 11.5% during the next
five years. Coverage for debt-service and preference share dividend
estimated at 4.3 times for FY84 is projected to decline to 2 times in FY88
which is still adequate. Debt-equity ratio is projected to increase from
0.6:1 in FY84 to 1.5:1 in FY88, which is still very conservative. An
agreement was reached with BDC at the loan negotiations that the
consolidated debt of BDC and its subsidiaries will not exceed five times

Background and Role
3.41      The National Development Bank (NDB), wholly owned by the
Government of Botswana was set up in 1963 by an Act of Parliament to
promote the economic development of Botswana. NDB has closely followed the
Government development priorities; as such, it became the primary
institution for financing agricultural and water development projects
promoted by very small farmers particularly those with no access to credit
from the commercial banks. As from 1980, NDB has also emerged as the main
institution for financing locally owned non-agricultural small-scale and
medium scale enterprises in the commercial and industrial sectors.

Capital
3.42      NDB's capital is designated as "unrecallable capital", and
consists of funds provided by the Government (P4.9 million) and grants from
overseas aid agencies (P726,000). The NDB Act requires NDB to pay interest
to the Governmert on its unrecallable capital unless the Minister of
Finance waives such interest payment. Thus, there is some ambiguity about
the status of NDB's capitalisation; it is not clear whether the
unrecallable capital represents equity in the normal sense of the word or
subordinated loans. During negotiations, the Government agreed to delete
all references to interest payments on capital in the NDB Act and to
provide additional capital to enable NDB to maintain a debt-equity ratio
not exceeding 5:1 during the life of the loan (para. 3.79). Amendment of
the NDB Act so as to remove all reference to interest payments is a
condition of effectiveness of the proposed loan.
Board of Directors
3.43      NDB's Board consists of 12 members including its General Manager
and Assistant General Manager, seven members from the private sector,
mostly retired civil servants, and three Government representatives. The
last three are the Chairman, who is the Director of Fiscal Affairs in the
Ministry of Finance, the Deputy Chairman, who is the Deputy Permanent
Secretary of the Ministry of Agriculture, and the Permanent Secretary of
the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. All Board members are appointed by
the Minister of Finance for a term of three years which can be extended.
There is no statutory limit on the number of Board members. The Board
meets once every month to consider applications for loans above the General
Manager's discretionary limit (currently P30,000). Although this remains
its main role, the Board has in the past three years, begun to take
increasingly active interest in matters relating to NDB's policies and
organization.
Organization
3.44      The NDB organization comprises of the Head office in Gaborone,
five regional offices each headed by a Regional Manager and eleven branch
offices headed by credit supervisors. The rapid growth in its level of
operations (para. 3.62) has put a strain on NDB's organizational and
administrative capacities. NDB's existing organization is not suited to
efficiently handle both a large number of agricultural micro-credits
(traditionally its major area of activity) and normal development banking
projects (including SSEs) which are larger, more complex and require a
different approach in terms of appraisal, implementation and follow-up.
The appraisal mission assisted NDB in drawing up a new organisation chart
which has recently been adopted. As a result, NDB has restructured its
organizational set-up by establishing two distinct departments: a
Micro-credit, Special Operations 12/ and Administration Department headed
12/ Projects and funds administered on behalf of Government e.g. Livestock
Development Project, Brigades Revolving Loan Fund.



- 30 -
by the present Assistant General Manager and a separate Development Bankinig
Operatiolns Department to be headed by an experienced second Assistant
General Manager. Under the proposed organisation structure, the
Administration, Micro-credit Special Operations and Administration
Department would consist of two divisions each headed by a Manager: (i)
Administration Division responsible for general administration, legal,
personnel training and staff development and, (ii) Micro-credit and Special
Operations Divisioni responsible for NDB's regional office, government
projects and all micro agricultural and commercial projects. The
I)evelopment Banking Operations Department will have four divisions:  (i)
the Planning Division responsible for plaianing future expansiol of NDB's
regional office network, and project identification and promotion; (ii) the
Commercial/Industrial Division for the appraisal and supervision of SSE's,
and medium size commercial/industrial projects; and (iii) the Agricultural
Projects Division for the appraisal and follow up of medium size
aLgricultural projects, and (iv) the Finance Division responsible for NDB's
accounting and financial management functions.  In the new structure, NDB's
internal audit unit will continue to report directly to the General
Manager. NDB's new organization structure, outlined above, should help it
to cope with its new expanding role and operations.
3.45      NDB has recently established two committees:  (a) a Management
Committee, comprising the General Manager, the Assistant General Manager,
Divisional Managers and two senior staff, which meets once a month and
deals with a broad range of matters including the institution's
organization, procedures and manpower development; and (b) a Loan
Committee, consisting of the Assistant General Manager and Divisional
Managers, which also meets once a month to review applications for loans
exceeding P5,000 and makes recommendations to the General Manager anid to
the Board on applications for loans below and above P30,000 respectively.
Management
3.46       NDB's General Manager joined the institution in May 1979, having
previously held high rankinig positions in the Government particularly in
the Ministry of Finance. He provides strong leadership to NDB and has in
the past three years played a dominant role in changing NDB's orientationi
from a low-key institutioni providing small loans to the agricultural sector
to a rapidly growing development bank that is now the main institution
providing financing to Small Scale Enterprises (SSEs). The present
Assistant General Manager, also a Botswana citizen, has been with NDB since
1970 and is head of NDB's Administration Division. In the new
reorganization (Aninex 7) he will take over responsibility for
administration and micro-credit operations. In order to effectively
undertake its recently started development banking activities, NDB will
need to strengthen its management by recruiting as soon as possible an
Assistant General Manager with proven experience in development bankinig to
head its development banking operations. Due to the lack of a suitably
qualified and experienced Batswana citizen, within NDB or outside, NDB is
already actively looking for an expatriate for this position.



- 31 -
3.47      Of NDB's six divisions, three:  Planning, Commerce and Industry,
and Finance -- and the Internal Audit Unit are headed by expatriate
managers whose contraicts are financed by bilateral agencies. NDB also has
an Agricultural Advisor funded by the FAO. Some of the Divisional Managers
lack the necessary expertise to effectively carry out their responsibi-
lities. NDB has assured the Bank that it will recruit suitably qualified
and experienced expatriates to head the key divisions (para. 3.49). The
contracts of the key expatriate staff would be financed from the proceeds
of the technical assistance component of the proposed loan (para. 4.02(c)).
Staffing, Staff Development and Training
3.48      Like most other institutions in Botswana, NDB relies extensively
on expatriate staff for middle level management (Division heads) and key
professional positions. Out of a total professional staff of 36, eight are
expatriates mostly funded by bilateral aid agencies and six are U.S. Peace
Corps volunteers. Five of the 22 Batswana professional staff were
recruited in the last 6 months. The majority of Batswana staff in lower
professional positions have not acquired the necessary experience to take
over the positions currently filled by expatriates; only a few have
received adequate training in accounting, finance and project appraisal.
Due to the shortage of adequately qualified and experienced local
professional staff, there are no Batswana counterparts assigned to the
expatriates. This situation is expected to improve as NDB recruits more
Batswana professional staff and continues training them (paras. 3.49 and
3.50). At negotiations, agreement was reached that NDB will assign local
counterparts to all expatriate divisional managers by June 1986.
3.49      The rapid growth in NDB's volume of operations in the past three
years and especially NDB's recently started regular development banking
activities, has strained its professional manpower capabilities both in
terms of number and expertise. To manage its existing portfolio and
planned operations effectively, NDB needs to recruit experienced staff to
fill key positions. Good progress has been made in this regard; NDB has
recruited an expatriate Chief Accountant and has identified suitable
candidates for the positions of the Assistant General Manager, Development
Banking and a Senior Projects Officer in the Commercial and Industrial
Division. The Assistant General Manager and Senior Projects Officer are
expected to take up their appointments by March 1984. NDB is also looking
for a qualified Motswana for appointment as Legal Officer. NDB needs to
recruit at least six Batswana university graduates over the next five
years, in an effort to gradually build up a cadre of Batswana professional
staff. NDB will also need to recruit a suitably qualified and experienced
Finance Manager before the end of September 1984, to replace the
expatriate currently filling this position, whose contract is due to expire
in mid-1984. During negotiations NDB agreed to: (i) fill the positions of
Assistant General Manager and Senior Project Officer before loan
effectiveness; (ii) recruit a Finance Manager, a Legal Officer by September
30, 1984, six additional Batswana University graduates over the next five
years; and (iii) assign Batswana counterparts to all expatriate Division
Managers by June 1986.



- 32 -
3.50      Training.  For the past three years NDB has made good progress in
the training and development of local staff.  In 1981, it established a
Training Unit and prepared a comprehensive, long-term program for providing
both on-the-job and external training to local staff. Training of Batswana
professional staff focusses on Accounting, Finance and Credit Management
and is provided through periodic courses held at the local Institute of
Development Management and through academic and professional correspondence
study. NDB plans to send abroad a few selected Batswana professional staff
on graduate degree programs in economics and/or finance and others on
short-term courses in various aspects of development banking. NDB also
provides in-house skill-upgrading courses to clerical and secretarial
staff.
3.51      The resources for meeting NDB's training needs are mainly
provided by bilateral agencies; the Botswana Government and USAID have
recently started a workforce and skills training project from which a major
portion of NDB's training resource needs will be met. To assist NDB pursue
and implement its training program a Technical Assistance component has
been included in the proposed loan (para. 4.02(c)) to finance the cost of
training NDB professional staff in key areas such as project appraisal,
accounting and financial management, and financing of SSEs, for which
financing from other sources may not be available.
Policies
3.52      The NDB Board recently approved a policy statement (Annex 8)
setting out guidelines for NDB's operations, investment and financial
policies. The key guidelines of the proposed statement are: that NDB
shall normally not finance more than 75% of a project's total cost, shall
limit its total financial commitment in a single enterprise to 20% of its
net worth, and that its debt to equity ratio shall not exceed 5:1. The
policy statement is satisfactory, comprehensive and is consistent with
NDB's Act and the overall framework of development programs and priorities
established by the Government.
Lending Terms
3.53      NDB lends for maturities of between 1 and 15 years, including a
normal grace period of 6 months for loans with maturities of up to 2 years
and 1 year for loans with longer maturities. Security is taken in form of
various legal instruments inicluding notarial bonds over property on tribal
land, mortgages and memoranda of agreement under the Agricultural Charges
Act.
3.54      NDB's lending rates have increased rapidly in the past 5 years
from 4.5% in 1979 to current levels ranging from a minimum of 16% p.a. 13/
to 18%.  Within this range, the interest charged depends on the nature cof
13/ During negotiations, Government and NDB agreed to raise the interest
rate charged on micro-credit agricultural loans from 14% to 16%; this
is now NDB's overall minimum lending rate.



- 33 -
the loan, whether it is for a productive enterprise or for a retail
business and whether the project is to be located in an urban or rural
area.  In general, loans to retail businesses in urban areas carry higher
interest rates than loans to rural based productive enterprises. In
addition to the interest rate, NDB charges a 2% p.a. penal interest on
overdue principal repayments; it plans to charge a 1% appraisal fee on
loans above P20,000 a-nd a commitment fee of 0.5% p.a. on uidisbursed loan
amounits. Given Botswana's current inflation rate of 11.5%, NDB's rates are
positive in real terms and in line with the rates charged by other
financial institutions. The Government has proposed that it would pass on
all funds to NDB (including the $5 million component of the proposed Bank
loan to the Government) at the rate fixed by the Government for loans to
all parastatals out of its Public Debt Service Fund (PDSF), which is
currently 10% p.a. Even with a minimum on-lending rate of 16%, the 6
percentage points spread would be insufficient to cover the administrative
costs associated with making micro loans to small farmers scattered
throughout Botswana7s large territory. Since the Government considers
on-lending to small farmers to be a priority activity for NDB on social
grounds, it has agreed to meet the uncovered costs by way of annual
subventions out of the budget. A confirmation to this effect was given at
the loan negotiations. NDB's other loans (small and medium size loans to
commercial and industrial enterprises and medium size loans to agriculture)
would be made at spreads which would cover their cost of administration,
provision for possible losses and a moderate profit margin. Interest rates
of 16%-18% on these operations (see Basic Data) are considered adequate.
The exchange risk on NDB's relatively small borrowing from external sources
is mainly borne by the Government with NDB assuming only 8.25% of the
risk 14/. During negotiations, it was agreed that during the execution of
the project NDB will annually review with the Bank the interest rates
charged in its lending operations. An understanding was reached that this
review will take account of the inflation rate, the interest rate structure
prevailing in Botswana, and the spread required to enable NDB to cover its
costs, provide for possible losses and generate a reasonable project.
Procedures
3.55      Appraisal.  Because of the nature of its operations, NDB's
appraisal procedures are essentially designed to handle a large number of
applications for small agricultural loans which dominate its portfolio.
The appraisal of small agricultural loans is jointly carried out by NDB's
Regional Office staff and Agricultural Development officers from the
Ministry of Agriculture. Regional offices also provide information on
larger projects which are appraised at Head office. Loans up to P5000 are
entirely appraised at the regional level and are approved by the Regional
Managers; all loans exceeding P5000 are appraised at Head office with the
General Manager approving loans up to P30,000.  Loans exceeding P30,000
require approval of the Board of Directors. A recently established Loan
Committee reviews all financing proposals before their submission to the
General Manager and to the Board.
14/ The annual grant from the Government for micro credit operations and
adequate spread on other operations should enable NDB to bear this
minimal risk.



- 34 -
3.56       Generally, the quality of appraisals of routine small
agricultural and commercial loans is satisfactory. However, the appraisal
of SSE and medium size projects which are a relatively new activity in NDB
is weak. NDB applies essentially the same technique applicable to
micro-credit operations to the appraisal of relatively larger and more
complex projects with the result that important aspects of a project are
dealt with in a superficial manner.  NDB recognizes, these weaknesses and
has recently hired a consultant to prepare a project appraisal manual
setting out appropriate guidelines for appraisal of SSE and medium size
projects. The manual is expected to be ready for use by March 1984.
3.57       Supervision.  Project supervision in NDB is weak due to the lack
of a systematic follow-up plan and procedures. This weakness is further
intensified by the large number of projects under implementation and in
operation.  Regional offices which have responsibility for project
supervision, are preoccupied with handling large numbers of applications
for new loans with the result that there is no follow-up on existing
projects. To date, the minimal supervision that NDB carries out relates
only to loans in serious arrears or default.
3.58       NDB is committed to correct this deficiency and has prepared a
draft project supervision manual, establishing appropriate supervision
procedures. It has also set up a Project Supervision Unit at Head office
to introduce a project follow up function in Regional offices, coordinate
t'heir efforts and ensure adequate supervision of the portfolio.
3.59       Procurement and Disbursement.  NDB requires each client to obtain
ani invoice from the supplier of items for which finanicing has been
approved.  Disbursements which are administered by Finance Division at Head
office are made directly to the supplier. NDB is currently revising
procuremenit and disbursement procedures with a view to bringing them in
line with those in force in other Bank-assisted DFCs. For major items to
be financed out of its loans, NDB will require project sponsors to obtain
al least three quotations from different sources before selection of the
supplier. A more efficient system of informing Regional offices of the
disbursement on each loan is being implemented.
3.60        Auditors.  NDB Board has reappointed Deloitte Haskins & Sells as
its auditors. The scope of their audits has been adequate. NDB has agreed
with the auditors that future audited accounts would be prepared and
presenited along the lines indicated in the "Illustrative Form of Audit
Reports for Development Finance Companies" and submitted to the Bank within
six months of the close of the financial year.
Operations
3.61       From the time of its establishment in 1963 up to 1979, NDB
concentrated on loans for agriculture and water development to small
farmers. In 1980, it started lending for industrial and commercial
activities and its volume of approvals in subsequent years has grown
rapidly as summarized below:

3.62       The volume of approvals grew rapidly from P1.2 million in 1979 to
P9.4 million in 1980; and the number of loans approved doubled over this
period. The level of operations has stabilized since 1980 with the number
and amount approved averaging 4300 loans for P12.2 million per annum
respectively. Since NDB started lending for medium size projects in 1980,
micro-credits (loans up to P20,000 each) as a proportion of total annual
approvals has declined from a high 98% in 1979 to an average of 65% in each
of the past three years. The average loan size increased from about P1000
prior to 1980 to about P3000 over the past three years.
3.63       Agricultural loans have financed mainly the purchase of livestock
(26% of amount approved), agricultural inputs (14%), agricultural machinery
(21%), farms (21%) and water development, mostly drilling and purchase of
bore hole equipment (18%).  Except for agricultural input loans, almost all
of which are for one year, all other loans have been for medium (1 to 5
years) or long (more than 5 years) terms. Recently, NDB has started
considering larger agricultural loans of more than P100,000 for commercial
farming; five such loans were approved in 1982. NDB's loans have
traditionally financed from 90% to 100% of total project costs.
3.64       In recent years NDB's agricultural loan approvals have been
relatively widely dispersed among regions with Kanye accounting for 33% of
the volume of FY83 approvals; Gaborone (23%); Serowe (23%); Maun (15%); and



- 36 -
Francistown (6%).  The proportion of loans approved for non-agricultural
activities -- mainly commercial and industrial enteprises, has increased
iErom 18% in 1979 to an average of 35% in each of the past 3 years.  In
commerce, NDB mainly finances stocks for street vendors in both urban and
rural areas and for retailers (mostly general dealers, bars etc. but a:Lso
some small supermarkets); loans for these activities are normally for 2-3
years.  Industrial loans are predominantly for small scale projects in such
activities as meat processing, dry cleaning, textiles and construction. As
iLn agriculture, NDB has started to finance larger size projects in industry
and in 1981-83 it approved 11 projects for more than P100,000 each in these
sectors.  The bulk of industrial and commercial loan approvals has been for
projects located in Gaborone. The percentage of total approvals per region
in the past three years was Gaborone (60%); Francistown (14%); Kanye (13%);
Serowe (11%); and Maun (2%).
3.65      NDB has in the past considered commitments to be synonymous with
approvals; and due to the poor quality of its records, NDB has not been
able to compile accurate record of its historical disbursements. This
deficiency is being rectified as NDB is in the process of computerizing its
financial records.
Portfolio
3.66      As of August 31, 1982 15/, NDB had a loan portfolio of P22.5
million covering 8,567 loans and two equity investments amounting to
P961,000. The sectoral distribution of the loan portfolio is summarized
below:
15/ Accurate portfolio data are available only up to August 31, 1982. NDB
is in the process of computerization of its financial records.
Up-to-date data is likely to be available towards the end of 1983 after
completion of the computerization exercise.

3.67      The loan portfolio as of August 31, 1982 was dominated by small
agricultural loans, mostly of less than P5000 each. Medium-size loans of
over P20,000 each accounted for only 1% of the number of loans but
represented about 23% of the value of the portfolio. The loan portfolio
was of acceptable quality, but is beginning to deteriorate due to the
present drought, weaknesses in project supervision (para. 3.57) and poor
loan collection procedures. As of August 31, 1982, loan arrears of more
than 3 months totalled P1.6 million, representing 7% of the portfolio, and
affected 2811 loans.  The arrears affected portfolio accounted for 21% of
total outstanding portfolio. With the planned implementation of
appropriate project selection, supervision and loan collection procedures,
the arrears situation is expected to gradually improve. NDB plans to
increase the level of bad debt provisions to 5% of the outstanding loan
portfolio at the end of each year. This is considered adequate.
3.68      As of August 31, 1982, NDB had equity investments in two
companies: (i) Development House (Pty.) Ltd. a subsidiary company of NDB
that owns commercial property; and (ii) Financial Services Company of
Botswana (Pty.) Ltd. - a hire purchase financing company; NDB regularly
receives an excellent return on its investment in the latter company.
Resources
3.69      NDB depends primarily on Government for resources to finance its
operations. As of June 30, 1983 its total resources amounting to P32.8
million consisted of: (i) P4.9 million contributed by the Botswana
Government, (ii) P760,000 in grants received from bilateral aid agencies;



- 38 -
(iii) P27.2 million in loans of which P25.9 has been borrowed from the
Government, P305,00 from NDB's subsidiary company, P660,000 from the EEC
aind P286,000 from the U.K. Exchequer. The borrowings are predominantly at
highly concessional rates of interest ranging from 1% p.a. on the EEC line
of credit, 5-6% on earlier borrowings from Government to 10% p.a. on the
most recent loan from the Government's Public Debt Service Fund. NDB's
resource position as of June 30, 1983 showed a gap of 2.1 million. It
proposes to cover this gap by internal cash generation, and additional
borrowings as indicated in paragraph 3.76.
Financial Performance and Situation
3.70      NDB's summarized financial statements for 1978 through 1983 are
shown in Annexes 9(a) and (b) and selected financial ratios in Annex 12
(d). NDB made losses in three of the past five years and the profits made
in 1979 and 1981 were only marginal; 1981 profits represented a low 0.2% of
average total assets. In the past 3 years, NDB has financed a large
portion of its general operating expenditures in regional offices, and to
some extent, those at head office from grant funds provided by Government,
mainly under the World Bank financed Second Livestock Project. Without
these grants, amounting to a total of P1.8 million, NDB's losses would have
been much larger. The poor financial performance is due to three main
factors: (i) the large number of very small loans entails high
administrative costs mainly because of the need to maintain a widespread
network of regional and branch offices in order to adequately cater for a
dispersed clientele in a large country; (ii) operational and cost
inefficiencies also result from inadequate institutional capabilities
especially in financial management and a lack of appropriate procedures;
and (iii) the 4% spread which NDB earns on the bulk of its loans is too low
to cover the high administrative costs of its operations. The technical
assistance component of the project is aimed at strengthening the
institution, particularly in the fields of financial management and
operational procedures. Furthermore, the increase in interest rates on
micro-credit operations in the agricultural sector (para. 3.54) and a
proposed study to be financed under the proposed project to explore
possibilities of reducing NDB's administrative expenses (para. 3.77) should
help alleviate the situation.
3.71      NDB's financial structure has changed significantly over the past
5 years. Its equity, has increased steadily from P2.7 million in 1978 to
P5.6 million as of June 30, 1983. However, borrowings increased even
faster during this period. As a result, NDB's debt equity ratio has risen
rapidly from 0.5:1 in 1978 to 5.2:1 at the end of March 1983. An agreement
with NDB was reached at loan negotiations that its debt equity ratio will
not exceed 5:1; in fact, it is expected to improve to 3.4:1 in 1988 (para.
3.80). Due to a very high rate of growth in the volume of operations and
the establishment of regional offices in the past three years, NDB's total
assets have increased rapidly, at an average rate of 68% p.a. in current:
terms and amounted to P32.5 million at the end of March 1983 up from P4.5
million in 1978. Until recently NDB used to drawdown from its borrowings
large amounts which were placed on short-term deposits with commercial



- 39 -
banks pending disbursement of loans approved. Due to the time gap between
loan approval and disbursement, NDB maintained an artificially high
liquidity position resulting in an abnormally high current ratio averaging
6.3:1 over the past 5 years. This practice is proposed to be discontinued
and in future NDB will draw down funds from the Government only to the
extent of its needs.
Prospects
3.72      NDB's Strategy.  NDB has recently prepared and adopted a strategy
statement (Annex 10) that will serve as a guide for its activities during
the next 2-3 years. The strategy places emphasis on two key areas: (i)
strengthening NDB's institutional capabilities through (a) establishing and
implementing appropriate procedures for its operations, and (b) recruiting
suitably qualified and experienced professional staff; (ii) given its
manpower constraints and institutional weaknesses, consolidating its
operations and trying to achieve a growth rate that is consistent with its
institutional capabilities. For this purpose NDB will seek to maintain its
operations at levels no higher than 1983 levels in real terms during the
next 2 years. As in the past, it would concentrate its financing in micro
agriculture and commercial projects and small and medium-scale projects in
the agriculture, commercial and industrial sectors.
3.73      Forecast Operations.  NDB's forecast operations for 1984-88 are
shown in Annex 11. Total approvals are forecast to remain constant in real
terms over the period FY84-86, and to increase by 20% per annum in 1987 and
1988. Total approvals over the five year period would thus amount to
P94million. Micro agricultural loans (up to P20,000) are expected to
account for 51% of the total volume of approvals; micro commercial and
industrial loans (up to P5000) for 5%; small-scale enterprise projects
(P5-20,000) for 4%; medium size agricultural loans (over P20,000) for 19%;
and medium size commercial and industrial loans (over P20,000) for 21%.
Commitments and disbursements are forecast at 95% and 70% of the level of
approvals in each year respectively. In order to ensure that the growth in
the level of operations does not strain NDB's institutional capabilities,
agreement was reached during negotiations that NDB will limit its rate of
growth to not more than the 1983 level in real terms for the next 2 years
while it streamlines and strengthens its organization, policies and
procedures.
3.74      The projections are supported by a large pipeline of projects.
For micro-credits, however, the pipeline is not indicative of future
operations, as new applications continuously come in through the district
and regional offices. As of mid-January 1983, NDB had a pipeline of 306
projects including: (i) 55 in agriculture for a total of P1.3 million;
(ii) 191 in commercial loans for a total of P2.6 million; and (iii) 60
industrial projects for a total of P1.9 million.   About 60% of the
commercial projects were for expansion of existing enterprises. The
industrial projects pipeline demonstrates a reverse trend, with about 60%
of projects involving the establishment of new enterprises. The types of



- 40 -
projects in the industrial/commercial pipeline include small general
dealers, textiles, construction, metal work, woodwork and hotels/tourism.
The agricultural pipeline includes four projects requiring more than
P100,000 each for farm purchase/development, while the commercial and
industrial pipelines includes four and six projects respectively in this
size category.
3.75      Resource Requirements.  NDB's resource needs over the 21 year
period, April 1, 1984 through September 30, 1986 are expected to evolve as
follows:
April 1, 1984 - September 30, 1986
(P'000)
Resource Needs                                                Amount

Resource Gap                                                   (8,861)
3.76      NDB's commitments during the 21 years period April 1, 1984 -
September 30, 1986 are projected to amount to P42.5 million; with
undisbursed commitments of P3.8 million at the beginning of the period,
NDB's total resource requirements are expected to amount to P46.3 million
(US$43.7 million). The proposed World Bank loan would represent about 11%
of total resource needs. In order to cover part of the P8.9 million
resources gap, NDB management plans to request further assistance from the
EEC and ADB and from other donor agencies. It is expected, however, that
the resource gap will be largely covered with additional borrowings from
the Government's Public Debt Service Fund. The Government has assured ithe
Bank that it will continue to provide loans to NDB, as needed, to enable it
finance its operations.



- 41 -
Projected Financial Condition
3.77      NDB's projected financial statements anid ratios for the period
1984 through 1988 are shown in Annexes 12(a) through 12(d). NDB's planned
operations over the next five years will continue to be dominated by
micro-lending activities. Given the nature of NDB's operations and the low
spread of 6% available on the bulk of its operations (micro-credits), NDB
would not be able to operate profitably unless its micro-credit operations
were adequately subsidized.  The Government has decided that since the
micro-credit operations are important for socio-economic reasons, it will
subsidize them openly in the form of cash grants to be budgeted annually on
the basis of number of NDB's projected micro-credit operations, their
administrative costs, and need for provisions for possible doubtful debts
minus the income received from the micro-credit loans. According to
projectionis, the proposed subsidy would increase from about P830,000 in
FY85 to about P1.3 million in FY88. While NDB would not be able to do away
with Government subsidy altogether, it would be important to reduce its
heavy reliance on the Government for this purpose. In view of this,
agreement was reached at negotiations that NDB will increase its interest
rate on agricultural micro-credit operationis (which are estimated to
account for about 70% of NDB's operations during FY84-88) from 14% to 16%.
Without an increase in the interest rate charged on agricultural micro
credit operations, a further subsidy of about P0.6 million a year would
be required over the next five years. It was also agreed that NDB would
carry out a study before the end of calendar year 1984 of ways to reduce
its administrative costs.  The study will be financed out of the technical
assistance component (US$800,000) of the project.
3.78      To help NDB strengthen its institutional capabilities, Government
will also pass on the proceeds of the proposed $800,000 technical
assistance component to NDB as a grant for financing key professional
staff, for training Batswana staff in project appraisal, accounting and
financial management, anid for the proposed administrative costs study
(para. 3.77).
3.79      To strengthen NDB's capital structure, agreement was reached with
Government at negotiations that it will increase NDB's capital to enable
NDB maintain a debt equity ratio not exceeding 5:1 during the life of the
loan.  Such ratio would be reviewed by the Bank, the Borrower and NDB at
the request of the Borrower or NDB if the Borrower or NDB consider that
such ratio is too restrictive in respect of the operation of NDB or the
operations of its subsidiaries.
3.80      With the Government subsidising its micro-credit operations,
NDB'S  financial performance over the next five years is projected to
improve significantly.  Average net profit after payment of dividends to
Governmenit 16/ is projected at P528,000 per year, representing a modest
but increased average annual return on average total assets of 2% and of 6%
on net worth.  With the expected increase in paid-in share capital and
16/  Government will require NDB to renumerate the paid-in share capital at
a rate of 8% p.a.; Governiment will use the dividends earned to
increase its share capital contribution.



- 42 -
reserves, NDB's debt-equity ratio is projected to improve from a 5.2:1 at
t'he end of March 1983 to 4.9:1 in 1984 and down to 3.4:1 in 1988.  NDB is
expected to maintain an adequate liquidity position and debt service
coverage is projected to improve from 1.4 times in 1984 to 2.9 times in
19388; overall, NDB's financial condition is expected to improve markedly if
Government implements the measures outlined above.
3.81      The recent recruitment of an experienced Chief Accountant and the
proposed recruitment of a suitably qualified Finance Manager by September
30, 1984 should help improve financial procedures and financial management.
IV. THE PROJECT
Objectives
4.01      The principal objectives of the proposed project are to: (i)
provide resources to: (a) BDC to finance part of its program to promote
and finance enterprises in productive sectors; (b) NDB to finance part of
its micro-credit, small-scale and medium-scale operations in productive
sectors and to help it to diversify into non-agricultural leading; and
(ii) strengthen NDB's institutional capabilities to carry out its role
effectively, as the leading institution for assisting the development of.
small and medium-scale enterprises in Botswana.  While Botswana's overall
macro-economic policy framework and industrial sector policies are
generally satisfactory, the Bank has -- in connection with the preparatiLon
of the proposed loan -- discussed and agreed with Government on
improvements in on-lending rate to small farmers (para. 3.77).  The loan
would also serve as a vehicle for continiue dialogue on interest rates
charged by BDC and NDB (paras. 3.15 and 3.54).
Description
4.02      The proposed project will have the following components:  (a) a
line of credit of US$6.2 million to BDC to finance part of the foreign
exchange component of cost of capital goods and services needed by its
subprojects in productive sectors and for establishment of industrial
estates and factory shells; (b) a line of credit of US$5.0 million to NDB
to finance part of the foreign exchange component of its micro-credit,
small and medium-scale subprojects in a broad range of productive sectors -
industrial, commercial, agro-industrial, agricultural, tourism, transport
and construction; (c) US$800,000 in technical assistance funds to finance
the contracts of key expatriate staff of NDB, the training of its Batswana
professional staff in project appraisal, supervision, accounting and
financial managemenit, and a proposed study on ways to lower administrative
costs; this amount would be passed on to NDB by the Govertnment as a grant;
and (d) US$200,000 to be used by the Government directly to finanice a
review by consultants of studies relevant to the options available to the
declining mining community of Selebi-Phikwe (para. 2.24).



- 43 -
Terms and Conditions
4.03       The Bank loan of US$12.3 million (including a rounded-up amount
of US$100,000 to finance the front-end fee) would be made to the Governiment
of Botswana on variable interest rate, with a fixed amortization schedule
for 15 years, including three years of grace, standard front end fee and
commitment charges. Both BDC and NDB would be required to reimburse the
Government the front-end fee and commitment charges.
4.04      Of the US$12.3 million loan, the Governmenit would use a sum of
US$1.1 million for technical assistance and for payment of the front-end
fee, and on-lend US$11.2 million to BDC and NDB under subsidiary loan
agreements, satisfactory to the Bank, with a fixed amortization schedule
for 15 years including three years of grace corresponding to the
amortization schedule between the Government and the Bank, on the terms and
conditions spelled out in the following paragraphs.
4.05      BDC.  A line of credit of US$6.2 million is recommended for BDC
on variable rate corresponding to the rate payable by the Government to the
Bank, with the Government assuming exchanige risk to the extent of 91.75% in
accordance with a formula prepared by the Government (Ar.nex 13), the
balance of 8.25% exchange risk being borne by BDC. The Bank loan would
finance about 18% of BDC's investment program during FY84-86.  BDC would
pass on funds from this line of credit to its sub-borrowers at its normal
rate of interest (at prime rate plus 0-3%) with fixed amortization
schedules depending on the debt-servicing capacity of the subprojects
within the maximum amortization schedule agreed between the Government and
BDC. BDC would have a free limit of US$250,000 for a subproject and an
aggregate free limit of US$1.5 million; this would ensure that the Bank
would review sub-projects using over 75% of the proceeds of the Bank loan.
In order to ensure that the Bank funds are used to finance a number of
projects, BDC would be required not to use Bank funds in excess of US$1.3
million equivalent to finance an individual subproject. Except for small
subprojects (involving subloans of US$130,000 or less), BDC would calculate
the economic rate of return on all subprojects financed under the loan and
the return would not be below 10%. Furthermore, in order to promote BDC's
further diversification away from property investments (para. 3.27) the
Bank funds would finance subprojects only in the productive sectors and for
establishment of industrial estates and factory shells.
4.06      NDB.  A line of credit of US$5.0 million is recommended for NDB
at a rate of interest fixed by the Government for loans out of its Public
Debt Service Fund, presently 10%.  The Bank's loan would finance about 11%
of NDB's commitments during FY84-86.  Since most beneficiaries of NDB loans
would be small-scale borrowers, it would not be feasible or appropriate for
NDB to pass on the variable interest rate risk to them.  The foreign
exchange risk oni the loan would be assumed by the Goverameat to the extent
of 91.75% in accordance with the standard Government formula (Anlex 13) for
risk-sharing on foreign currency loans onlent by the Government to
parastatals; the balance (8.25%) will be borne by NDB. NDB would pass on



- 44 -
funds from this line of credit to its sub-borrowers in accordance with its
normal interest rates (para. 3.54) with fixed amortization schedules
depending on the debt-servicing capacity of the subproject within the
overall repayment period of 15 years. Agreement was reached at
negotiations that not more than US$2 million would be normally available
for financing micro-credit operations unless the Bank otherwise agrees.
This is considered important to diversify NDB's operations from the
hitherto predominantly micro credit operations, which are essentially
character loans, to slightly larger SSE operations involving use of more
sophisticated project appraisal techniques by NDB. Furthermore, in order
to ensure that the major portion of the loan onlent to NDB is used to
assist SSEs in non-agricultural sectors, it was agreed that not less than
US$3.0 million would be available for subloans in these sectors.
4.07      NDB will be allowed a free limit of US$50,000 for an individual
subproject and an aggregate free-limit of US$3.0 million. This would allow
the Bank to review most medium size subprojects. A higher aggregate
free-limit for NDB than for BDC was set because of the large number of very
small sized subprojects which NDB would finance out of the Bank loan. The
average size of NDB subloans out of the Bank's credit line is estimated to
be about P20,000. In order to ensure that Bank funds are used to finance
only small and medium-size projects, agreement was reched at negotiations
that the maximum loan amount to a subproject financed out of Bank loan
would not exceed the equivalent of US$500,000. It was further agreed that
the Bank funds would finance subprojects only in productive sectors, that
NDB will calculate the economic rate of return on all subprojects usilng
more than US$100,000 of Bank funds and that this return will not be below
10%.
Project Implementation
4.08      Reporting Requirements.  Both BDC and NDB would be required to
submit quarterly reports which would include a summary of operations,
financial statements, resource position, statement of arrears, and notes on
the situation of projects in their portfolio in difficulties. They would
also be required to submit audited annual accounts, prepared in accordance
with the Bank group guidelines for audit of DFCs, by qualified auditors
approved by the Bank, within six months of the close of the financial year.
4.09      Procurement.  Procurement of goods and services under the BDC
line of credit would be in accordance with BDC's procurement practices,
which are adequate (para. 3.12). NDB has recently revised its procurement
procedures and these are now in line with those followed by Bank-assisted
DFCs (para. 3.59) and procures goods and services in accordance with these
procedures. The selection of consultants under the project and the terms
and conditions of their employment will be subject to approval of the
Bank. The qualifications and experience of expatriate staff for NDB to be
financed under the technical assistance component would also be acceptable
to the Bank.



- 45 -
Disbursements
4.10       Disbursement of the various components of the loan would be as
follows:
(i)  Proceeds of the component for credit lines to BDC and
NDB would finance:
(a)  100% of the c.i.f. cost of imported goods into
Botswana;
(b)  80% of the local cost of goods previously imported
into Botswana through normal trade channels; and
(c)  75% of the cost in local currency of civil works
included in subprojects.
(ii) Proceeds of the technical assistance component would
finance an estimated 140 staff months of consultants at
an average cost of US$5,000 per month for item (a) and
an average cost of US$10,000 per month for item (b)
below; the remainiing amount of US$100,000 would finance
staff training. Disbursements would be for:
(a)  100% of the salaries of selected key expatriate
staff hired;
(b)  100% of any studies carried out by foreign
consultants to improve NDB's operational/
administrative efficiency; and
(c)  100% of the total cost of travel to and from
Botswania, tuition and subsistence during training
of NDB's Batswana professional staff.
(iii)  Proceeds of the component for consultancy services for
Selebi-Phikwe study would finance 100% of the
consultancy services, travel etc. involving an
estimated 20 staff moniths at an average cost of
US$10,000 per staff month. This component would be
administered by the Governmenit and the terms of
reference of the consultants should be acceptable to
the Bank.
4.11       In order to expedite disbursement of funds under the credit line
to NDB, for a large number of micro-credit and small-scale operations
involving loans up to the equivalent of US$20,000 agreement was reached at
negotiations that Government would establish a Special Account in a
financial institution acceptable to the Bank from which NDB could claim
reimbursement against actual documentatioln or a certified statement of
expenditure; this fund would be initially started with an advance of
US$250,000 out of the Bank line of credit for NDB, and replenished by the
Bank subsequently in accordance with an agreed procedure.  The US$250,000
would cover the anticipated Bank contribution to eligible micro-credits for
six month periods. The establishment of the Special Acount is a condition
for disbursement of the NDB component of the proposed project.



46 -
4.12      In view of the proposed Special Account and given BDC's ability
to commit and disburse funds quickly, neither the Bank-wide nor the
Region-wide sectoral disbursement profiles for the IDF sector are
considered relevant.  Projected disbursemenits in Annex 14 are, therefore,
based on BDC's and NDB's forecast of disbursements. BDC should be able to
commit funds by June 30, 1986 and NDB by June 30, 1987. Disbursemenits for
BDC subloans and investments should be completed by June 30, 1989 anid those
for NDB subloans by June 30, 1990.
Benefits and Risks
4.13      The major benefits of the project are as follows:  firstly, the
project envisages building up the National Developmeat Bank inlto a
stronger, more effective financial intermediary to channel funds to smaLll
farmers and small-scale entrepreneurs who do not get adequate assistance
from commercial sources; secondly, the project would enable both BDC and
NDB to create new employment opportunities for Batswana citizens by
promoting and financing enteprises in productive sectors. Although it is
difficult at this stage to quantify with any precision the number of new
jobs that would be created under the project, it is estimated that the
subprojects assisted under the Bank loan would provide direct employment to
about 5,000 Batswana at an estimated average cost per job below US$7,500.
The Government perceives the role of these two institutions as crucial in
implementing its development strategy to diversify the economic base of the
country and to increase the participation of its citizenis in the economic
opportunities. The project will also serve as a vehicle for continued
dialogue on Botswana's interest rate structure.  Because of the Bank's role
in institution building in the case of NDB and continued financial support
to BDC, the proposed assistance would play a catalytic role in attractiLng
funds from other multi-lateral and bilateral institutions such as EIB,
AfDB, CDC, FMO and DEG, (paras. 3.39 and 3.76).
4.14      The only major risk associated with the project is that due to
lack of qualified and experienced staff, progress in building NDB into a
stronger institution could be slower than anticipated. The recruitment of
key experienced expatriate staff and additional Batswana professional
staff, and increased staff training, are expected to mitigate this risk.
This aspect of the project will be closely monitored during project
implementation.

V. AGREEMENCS REACHED AT NEGOTIATIONS
5.01       During negotiations, agreement was reached with the Government,
BDC and NDB on the following:
(a)  With Governiment that it will:
(i)  amend NDB Act before loan effectiveness by
deleting all references to interest payments on
capital as well as providing additional capital to
enable NDB to maintain a debt-equity ratio not
exceeding 5:1 over the life of the loan (para.
3 .42);
(ii)  make annual grants to NDB to cover that portion of
NDB's cost of administering micro credits which is
not covered by the spread available to NDB on its
resources (para. 3.54);
(iii)  on-lend US$6.2 million to BDC and US$5 million to
NDB under subsidiary loan agreements satisfactory
to the Bank (paras. 4.04, 4.05 and 4.06); and
(iv)  establish before disbursement of the NDB component
of the proposed loan, a Special Account in a
financial institution acceptable to the Bank for
expeditious disbursement of proceeds of the Bank
loan for micro credits (para. 4.11).
(b)  With BDC that it will:
(i) review annually with the Banik BDC's lending rates
(para. 3.15);
(ii) maintain a consolidated debt-equity ratio
(together with its subsidiaries) of not more than
5:1 during the life of the loan (para. 3.40);
(iii)  not use more than US$1.3 million in Bank funds to
finance any one project (para. 4.05);
(iv) require that projects usillg more thani US$130,000
of Bank funds should have an adequate economic
rate of return, not below 10% (paras. 3.09 and
4.005);
(v) use Bank loan only to finance subprojects in
productive sectors and for establishment of
industrial estates and factory shells (para.

BOTSWANA
BOTSWANA DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION (BDC)
INVESTMENT POLICY AND PROCEDURES
(23rd June 1982)
GENERAL
1.        The Botswana Development Corporation's objectives are:
(a)  to create and/or;
(b)  to promote and assist the development in Botswana, of
commercially and economically viable businesses including those
in the private sector, which either:
(i)    because of the nature of their products or
services or
(ii)   because of the manner in which they are operated
will contribute to national goals as stated in
the National Development Plan.
2.        The National Development Plan favors the establishment of
enterprises which will have potential for:
(a)  generating significant employment;
(b)  adding to the skills of Botswana nationals;
(c)  producing products which can be substituted for imports;
(d)  generating additional business opportunities;
(e)  creating local entrepreneurs;
(f)  contributing to the rural economy;
(g)  upgrading natural resources;
(h)  creating new national assets;
(i)  diversifying the base of the economy; and
(j)  contributing to the creation of a nationally owned commercial and
indust

ANNEX 3
Page 2 of 9 pages
3.        The National Development Plan also relies heavily on the private
sector for investment in productive assets in agriculture, industry,
transport, commerce, realty, hotels, and tourism.
FORMS OF ASSISTANCE
4.         The Botswana Development Corporation (BDC) can assist enterprises
in the form of:
(a) Share capital;
(b) Call loans;
(c) Term loans;
(d) Overdraft finance;
(e)  Guarantees; and
(f)  Management services.
THE ROLE OF THE BOTSWANA DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION
5.        The BDC will use its approved forms of assistance to promote the
objectives of the National Development Plan in the sectors described in
paragraph (3) in a manner complimentary to those of the private sector, the
commercial banks, and other financial institutions. In order to minimize
the obstacles to development in these sectors, this principle of
complimentarity will not be pursued to the point of preventing any overlap
between the activities of the BDC and those of other financial
institutions. In particular, it is acknowledged that BDC may:
(a) implement on its own viable projects which the private sector has
failed to undertake and is willing to participate in; and
(b) make term loans without any associated equity investment.
6.        Below are listed specific objectives for BDC assistance to a
project.  As a general rule BDC will not assist a project unless the
pursuance of one or more of these objectives requires it, and it will limit
its assistance to the minimum necessary to meet such objectives.



a 54 -
ANNEX 3
Page 3 of 9 pages
Specific Objectives
(a) Investment in projects, for which public investmenlt, control, or
influence is in the national interest;
(b) Investment in projects where BDC's or Botswana source investment
is required to allow the project to proceed to implementation or
to make it viable;
(c)  Provision of viable based project finance in cases when security
for loans is inadequate for other financial institutions;
(d) Assistance to projects (both financial anid managerial) where
there is a need for management assistance which BDC can supply.
This assistance will be limited to companies controlled by
Botswana citizens, except in cases when an existing enterprise is
in difficulties;
(e) Provision of industrial and commercial property to those who for
whatever reason do not wish or ought not to own property
themselves, and in a manner which will encourage investors to
locate in Botswana;
(f)  A quick and effective service to investors ranging from provision
of land or buildings to assistance with obtaining Government
permits and financial assistance;
(g)  Investment in profitable ventures which can generate additional
resources for reinvestment by tne Corporation;
(h)  The use of guarantees to elicit finance for financially viable
projects from third parties either directly for relatively
large projects or indirectly through financial intermediaries
for smaller projects;
(i) Provision to Botswana citizens of orderly access to ownership of
enterprises of proven viability. Assistance of this nature must
not result in any effective subsidization of the prospective
owners of the enterprise in question; and
(j) Assistance to small-scale enterprises through a separate company,
with its own investment policy and procedures.

ANNEX 3
Page 4 of 9 pages
INVESTMENT CRITERIA
7.        The following investment criteria are to be used in pursuance of
the above objectives. Proposals to the Board of Directors should
demonstrate that these criteria have been met and should follow the
attached "Format for BDC Board Proposals" .
(a)  The BDC's operations will be guided by sound commercial
principles. The BDC's investment decisions will be based on
sound appraisal methods, and will particularly take into account
the total financial requirements   of the project and the
soundness of the resulting financial structure for the
enterprise;
(b)  The BDC normally will seek to finance or otherwise assist
enterprises only where new productive assets are to be created,
or where the purpose of BDC's assistance is to procure the
transfer of ownership of the enterprise into the hands of
Botswana citizens;
(c) For all assisted projects there must be some estimate made of the
economic as distinct from financial impact of the project on the
economy.  The economic rate of return on the project must be at
least equal to the opportunity cost of capital used by the
Ministry of Finance and Development Planning;
(d)  The effect of each assisted project on the acquisition of skills
by Botswana nationals and the specific training plans of the
enterprise must be described;
(e)  The BDC will finance only economically viable, technically
feasible projects with competent management. No project can be
financed that is not expected to be commercially viable on the
basis, if necessary, of a predetermined form and level of
subsidy;
(f)  The BDC will not normally manage enterprises, although it will
use its best endeavors to ensure the acquisition of competent
management. It will, however, notwithstanding these limitations,
take such action as it considers appropriate when, in case a
project supported by it is in jeopardy, it has to protect its
investment;



- 56 -
ANNEX 3
Page 5 of 9 pages
(g)  In considering whether or not to take a controlling interest in
the voting securities of the projects in which it ilnvests, the
BDC will base its decision on relevant Government policies, and,
where no specific Government policy directives are applicable,
the BDC will seek to minimize its interest in projects subj,ect to
whatever is prudent to safeguard BDC's investment in the project;
(h) BDC will seek to arrange the terms of its investments so that
when each assisted enterprise is successful, the BDC will have
the opportunity to realize a capital profit. For this purpose,
the BDC will seek to retain the right to dispose of its
shareholdings in an assisted enterprise to third parties at
commercial prices free of other shareholder rights of first
refusal. When disposing of an investment, the BDC will firstly
seek Botswana nationals as buyers;
(i) BDC will generally not finance more then 50% of total capital
cost including permanent working capital with the exception of
investments below P500,000 where a maximum of 75% applies and
with the exception of subsidiary companies; and
(j) Except in the case of subsidiary companies, the private
shareholders must contribute at least 25% of the capital cost.
Where these shareholders include Batswana citizens, this
contribution may include capital grants available from Government
and attributable to the private shareholders.
LIMITATIONS
8.        The following limitations shall apply to investments by the BDC:
(a) The BDC's aggregate investments in share capital will not be!
allowed to exceed the Corporation's own net worth;
(b)  The BDC will not normally invest more than 15% of its net worth
in the share capital of any one project; and
(c)  The BDC will not normally invest more than 25% of its net worth
in the form of loans and/or share capital in any one project.

ANNEX 3
Page 6 of 9 pages
PROCEDURES
9.   (a)  Applicants for assistance from the BDC will be asked to cooperate
with, and assist in, the preparation of a feasibility study;
(b) The BDC will not formally invest any funds in any project prior
to the completion of a thorough feasibility study;
(c) The BDC will not normally invest any funds in any project prior
to signing an agreement which will provide the BDC with the
ability to take remedial action should the value of its
investment become endangered;
(d) When investing its funds the BDC will seek to:
(i)  secure its priacipal; and
(ii)  structure its investment in such a way that the
financial strength of each assisted enterprise
is increased;
(e) The BDC will seek to protect itself against the exchange risks of
foreign borrowings;
(f) The BDC will seek to diversify its investments both
geographically aid by sectors;
(g) The BDC will recruit qualified personnel for its operations;
(h)  The BDC will supervise its investments to protect its interests
and to enable it to assist its projects to the maximum extent
possible; and
(i) For all projects, excepting those for which there is a case on
economic grounds for relaxing normal financial conditions for
investmenit, the BDC shall charge market rates for its funds or
services.

INVESTMENT LIMITS
9.           NDB will not finance more than 75% of the total capital costs
of a project (including permanent working capital) but may finance up to
85% of a project's capital costs in the case of small-scale enterprises
promoted by Batswana citizens. In either case, promoters' contribution in
kind (e.g. buildings) will be acceptable but will be evaluated by means
satisfactory to NDB. In this regard, NDB shall ensure that project
sponsors have made their contributions to the cost of the project before
disbursing any proceeds of its loans.
10.         Except as the Government may agree after consultation with the
Bank, NDB's total outstanding commitment in favor of one single enterprise
shall not exceed 20 percent of NDB's net worth.
11.         NDB's total investments in the form of equity participation
shall not exceed 25% of the Bank's networth. In any one single enterprise,
NDB's maximum equity investment shall not exceed 5% of the Bank's networth,
nor 30% of the share capital of the enterprise.
FINANCIAL POLICY
12.         The Bank shall charge interest rates, fees, and commission
which are compatible with the prevailing rates and or which enable it to
earn a reasonable return on its financing operations. The Bank shall
charge higher interest rates and/or make loans of shorter maturities to
projects whose financial prospects would enable them to borrow on such
terms.
13.         NDB shall at all times maintain a satisfactory balance between
the maturities of its obligations and those of the loans it grants.
14.         NDB shall at all times seek to protect itself against exchange
risk on foreign currency borrowings.
15.         NDB shall make adequate provisions against potential losses and
build up reserves to a level consistent with sound financial practices
taking into account the size and quality of its portfolio.
16.         NDB shall seek adequate security for its loans.
17.         NDB's total long term debt shall not at any one time exceed
four times the amount of its unimpaired capital, surplus and reserves.

/1  NDB has recently changed its fiscal year from January 1 - December 31, to
April 1 - March 31 in order to be consistent with the Government fiscal year.
Figures for 1983 are as at March 31, and represent a 15 month period;
January 1, 1982 - March 31, 1983. As such there is no FY82.
/2 Fees paid to NDB for administration of special funds.
/3 Includes P200,000 cash grant from Government.
/4 Includes rental income (P205,000) from Development House which has been
transferred from subsisidiary to NDB and P1,420,000 drawn down from the second
livestock project in form of a grant from Government to NDB.
/5 Apart from the extended fiscal year (see footnote 1), this figure is higher
than in preceeding years owing mainly to the facts that (i) NDB's regional
office network was significantly expanded in the period in question; (ii) the
administrative expenses associated with the regional office network were not
consolidated into NDB's accounts until 1983; and (iii) the salaries of many of
NDB's expatriate staffmembers were financed -- on a grant basis -- by
bilateral agencies prior to 1982/83. It was only in FY83 that their salaries
began to be covered by NDB and thus began appearing in its administrative
expenses.
/6 Higher financial expenses reflect much increased volume of operations by NDB
in 1979-81 period, which, in turn, required NDB to obtain loans at near-
commercial rates to finance this increase. In prior years, NDB's modest level
of activities had enabled it to finance most of its on-lending from
concessional sources.
/7 NDB began to depreciate its assets only in 1983.

ANNEX 10
Page 1 of 2 pages
NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT BANK (NDB)
STRATEGY STATEMENT
The following principles will serve as a guide for NDB's
activities during the coming 2-3 years. They constitute NDB's strategy for
strengthening its effectiveness in assisting the economic development of
Botswana and supplement NDB's Act and its operating policies. After its
approval by the Board of Directors, this strategy will be widely publicized
within the institution so that staff are fully aware of it and become fully
committed to its implementation. It will be reviewed from time to time in
light of developments taking place in Botswana's economy.
1.        STRENGTHENING INSTITUTIONAL CAPABILITIES
During the next 2-3 years, NDB will place emphasis on
strengthening its institutional capabilities in order to increase its
efficiency and effectiveness as a development finance institution. To
achieve this objective, NDB will:
(a) establish and implement appropriate procedures for
project promotion, appraisal, implementation and
supervision; as well as for procurement, disbursement
and loan collections;
(b) recruit suitably qualified and experienced professional
staff to fill key positions; and
(c) recruit adequately qualified Batswana professional
staff and provide them with on-the-job and external
training to strengthen their technical and professional
capabilities.
2.        OPERATIONS
(a)  Consolidation:  Given NDB's manpower constraints and
the need to devote its available technical and
professional resources to the establishment of
appropriate systems and procedures as outlined in (1)
above, NDB will consolidate its operations and seek to
grow at a rate that is consistent with its
institutional capacity. For this purpose NDB will seek
to maintain its operations at levels no higher than
1983 levels in real terms during the next 2-3 years.



- 74 -
ANNEX 10
Page 2 of 2 pages
(b) NDB will concentrate its financing in the following
priority areas: micro-agriculture and commercial
projects, small and medium-scale projects in the
agriculture, commercial and industrial sectors.
(c) Within the key sectors selected, NDB will place
emphasis on the financing of projects which contribute
to transfer of technology and the development of local
manpower skills and which utilise local raw materials.
(d) NDB will pay particular attention to financing projects
which are labor-intensive and therefore have potential
for creating new employment. As a guideline, project
investment cost per job created up to a level of
P15,000 would be considered acceptable. To be eligible
for financing by NDB, projects with investment cost per
job exceeding this level would have to be justified on
the basis of very large other economic benefits.
(e) NDB will coordinate its activities with those of
institutions/agencies providing technical assistance to
ensure that projects receiving financial assistance
especially those owned and managed by Batswana
nationals, also receive adequate technical assistance
and extension service support.

Formula for Sharing Foreign Exchange Risk
The protection against exchange risk afforded by Government is
based upon the following formula:
(a) A base exchange rate for the loan shall be established;
(b) Repayments of the loan plus interest shall be
calculated at the quoted exchange rate 14 days before
each due date for repayment;
(c) Variations will be shown between the base rate and the
rate calculated at item 2 above; and
(d) The partial protection or benefit will be borne as
follows:
(i) The first 4% of the percentage variation will be
borne by the applicant;
(ii) Of the next 6% of the percentage variation,
Government will contribute one half;
(iii) Of the next 5% of the percentage variation
Government will contribute three quarters;
(iv) All of the variation exceeding 15% will be borne
by Government; and
(v) Benefits will be shared in the same proportions
shown in (a) to (d) above.
