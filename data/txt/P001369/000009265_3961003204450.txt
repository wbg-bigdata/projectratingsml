MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF KENYA
FOR AN EMERGENCY DROUGHT RECOVERY PROJECT
1.    This memorandum and recommendation on a proposed Credit to the Republic of Kenya for SDR
14.6 million (US$20 million equivalent) to help finance an Emergency Drought Recovery Project is
submitted for approval. The Credit would be on standard IDA terms with 40 ye-s maturity.
2.    Background on the Drought Situation. Kenya is currently suffering from the aftermath of a
severe drought. The country on average has experienced less than normal rainfall over a two year period.
The severity if the drought has been felt mainly in the arid and semi-arid lands (ASAL), which constitute
80 percent of the land area and are inhabited by about 30 percent of the population (around 7.5 million
people, of whom about 4 million depend on agriculture and 3.5 million on livestock, including about one
million nomads). The ASAL poplations are among the most vulnerable in terms of their ability to procure
food during disasters. They are also among the most disadvantaged in terms of their access to Government
provided services. The severity of the drought appears to have seriously undermined the traditional coping
methods of these communities. The prolonged failure of rains has critically affected food production as
famers use plantng seed for food. Destruction of pastures ad drying up of water holes have resulted Ui
livestock losses, with average mortality rates of about 25 percent. As a result, malnutrition, particularly
among young children, is widespread, as pastoralists are denied milk and the ability to purchase other
sources of food. Access to safe water has declined drastically and the resulting high incidence of water-
borne and other disemses is putting pressure on the already limited local health care services. The situation
has been aggravated by an influx of refugees and many years of inadequate investment in public
rastructure. It is estimated that about two million people, including 500,000 refugees from countries to
the north and east, are now at risk.
3.    All the evidence points to the probability that the adverse impact of the drought will be long-lasting.
Ihe lack of rain, coupled with poor production incentives, has resulted in unfavorable harvests of the main
cereal, maize. Maize stocks have reached an historic low, and the deficit is being met by imports. Total
cereal imports for 1992-93 are estimated at one million tons, of which food aid would probably need to be
about 500,000 tons.
4.    The Government's response to the crisis, though initially slow, has now improved and critical
institutional mechanisms have been put into place to deal with problems both at the national and district
levels under the mandate of the Office of the President. However, Government's ability to address issues of
food imports and recovery assistance are restricted by foreign exchange and budgetary constraints.
Consequeny, critical efforts, maily financed by NGOs and donors, are under way to mitigate at least the
initia adverse consequences of the drought by establishing feeding programs and relief activities. In many
parts of the ASAL areas the local populations are almost totally dependent on relief agencies and programs
for their basic survival. More critically, their ability to regain their economic livelihood even in the advent
of favorable rains has been almost totally eroded. Unless a sensible and sustinable recovery program is put
into place, the affected ASAL populations will not be able to break away from their current state of
impoverishment.
5.    ProJect Objectives: The proposed project would fund specific components of the Government's
overall Drought Recovery Program (DIRP), prepared with assistance from UNDP in cooperation with the
UN Disaster Management Team (UN DM1), to assist the ASAL populations affected by the drought to
begin a sustainable recovery process. The DRP details the overall concepul framework, sectoral
investments, priority districts and management arrangements. It also sets out the immediate productive



2
needs (through April 1993) and the intermediary investment needs (through October 1994). The DRP,
estmated base cost US$85 million, also provides donors with a framework for additional coordinated
investments. Some of the project investments would lay the foundation for future interventions in the
longer-term ASAL project scheduled for appraisal in FY94. The main objectives of the proposed project
are: (i) to alleviate the impact of the current drought through measures to regenerate productive capacity in
agriculture and livestock production for the ASAL populations, improve water supply and basic health
services, and provide access to and within the arid districts of Mandera, Marsabit and Turkana; and (ii) to
assist in enhancing institutional capacity at the district level to deal with drought. The long term objective is
to begin the process of tackling the underlying causes which make ASAL populations increasingly
vulnerable to drought situations.
6.    Project Description: The following criteria were used in determining the components to be
considered for financing: (a) ability to target a package of investments to benefit victims of the drought; (b)
implementable within current operational ;onstraints and within a project period of 24 months; and (c)
responsive to the Government's DRP and incremental to ongoing and planned Government and donor
assistance. The project would support a package of productive interventions (in agriculture and livestock)
covering all the ASAL districts, and a further package (for water supply, rural road rehabilitation, health
services and drought managment/environment) targeted primarily in the three arid districts of Mandera,
Marsabit and Turkana to rehabilitate existing structures. These actions would also support possible future
interventions in the ASAL project. It would also finance the institutional structure for project
implementation. The project would have the following components, to be financed from the proposed IDA
Credit, amendments to existing IDA Credits and by the Government of Kenya (para. 7):
(a)    Agriculture Inputs: Supply of packages of seed and fertilizer, and a limited number of
hand tools, for free distribution to farmers in the ASAL districts in time for the 1993 long
rains planting. The project would provide financing for the following, including transport to
the project area: 15,000 tons of fertilizer; maize, sorghum, beans, cowpeas and vegetable
seeds; and about 80,000 hoes and pangas (base cost US$7.5 million).
(b)   lIvestock: Provision of vaccines, typanocidal drugs, clinical drugs, vaccination equipment
and other consumable and operatng costs associated with carrying out vaccination and
animal treatment programs in ten ASAL districts to improve the general level of health of
the surviving animal populations (base cost US$2.5 miliion).
(c)    Drought Manag_m t: The project would finance operating costs, training, short-term
technical assistance, vehicles and office equipment to assist in seting up a system of drought
management at the district level to help Government prepare for drought, minimize the
effects and prevent droughts from turning into famines (base cost US$1.8 million).
(d)    Environent: The project would provide operating costs, materials and supplies, and
training and short-term technical assistance to test different approaches to resource base
preservation, such as water point protection, seed plots, revegetation, mini-spate diversions
and range extension (base cost US$0.85 million).
(e)    Infrastrut     Rehabilitation of about 420 km. of critical roads; technical assistance for (i)
preparation of bid documents and supervision of the road contracts, and (ii) three studies on
communications and other infrastructure requirements; spare parts for rehabilitation of
vehicles and equipment; and camping equipment (base cost US$7.5 million).



3
(f)    Water: Rehabilitation of existing water facilities in the three focus districts and in Tana
River; capacity building (including training of community groups in management of water
sources and rehabilitation of vehicles, plant and equipment); and provision of three water
tankers to meet temporary water transportation needs (base cost US$5.15 million).
(g)   Health: Provision of drugs and medical supplies, as well as vehicles and equipment;
rehabilitation of buildings, vehicles and equipment; operating costs; and training to
strengthen the capacity of the health services in the .hree focus districts and in Tana River
(base cost US$2.0 million).
(h)    Inplementation: The project would finance the establishment of a Project Management
Unit (PMU), including staffing, short-term technical assistance, vehicles, office equipment
and operating expenses (base cost US$1.1 million).
7.    Project Finaning: The total project cost of US$29.55 million, net of duties and taxes, would be
financed from a new IDA Credit of US$20 million, amendments to existing IDA Credits totalling US$7.25
million, and a contribution of 10 percent of the new project cost (US$2.3 million equivalent) in local
currency from the Government of Kenya through the provision of seed. A breakdown of costs and the
financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement, and the disbursement
schedule, are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key processing events and the Status of Bank Group
Operations in Kenya are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. The Technical Annex and a map are
also attached. The appraisal mission reviewed existing IDA-supported operations in Kenya with
Government to estimate the amounts that could be reallocated for immediate emergency assistanPs for the
provision of fertlizer, hand tools, requirements for the animal vaccination campaign and the establishment
of the PMU. The components to be funded from the amended Credits fall within the broad objectives set
out in those Credits (para. 89 of Technical Annex). Procurement has been initiated from the proceeds of
the existing amended IDA Credits. The project is expected to be completed by March 31, 1995.
8.    Project Implemtation: The proposed project would be implemented under the National Famine
Relief Coordinatin Committee in the Office of the President (OP), which is chaired by the Secretary to the
Cabinet and Head of the Public Service. A Special Recovery Team (SRT), with representatives from the
OP, Treasury, Office of the Vice President and Ministry of Planning and National Development, and the
Chairnmn of the UN DMT would be responsible for overall planning, coordination and monitoring. A
Project Management Unit (PMU) onsisting of senior representatives from the concerned line ministries,
OP, and representatives of participating donors would be established. The PMU would have overall
responsibility for realizing the DRP and project objectives and outputs, as well as promoting institutional
capacity for ASAL development. The PMU would have a Secretariat consisting of a management team
(p,roject coordinator, deputy project coordinator, technical advisor, procurement and finance officers and
four district coordinators) charged with operationalizing implementation of the project. The project
coordinator would also serve as the secretary of the SRT.
9.    The district coordinators would liaise with existing drought relief agencies through the District
Development Committee, but would report directly to the project coordinator. The district focs for project
implementation would be the District Drought Recovery Steering Group (DDRSG), which is a sub-
committee of the District Development Committee. The DDRSG would be strengthened by the participation
of community representatves, NGOs and relevant donors, as well as line ministries, and would be chaired
by the district coordinator.
10.   Lessons Learned: The project has drawn on experience with other recent emergency operations.
Ihe main lessons, which have been incorporated into the project design, while keeping the project in line



4
with the overall strategies for each sector, are: (a) the project is part of a comprehensive Government
recovey program being assisted by other donors; Ob) investments are targeted to v.ctims of the drought; (c)
Government organizational structures have been adapted to overcome bureaucratic delays and be responsive
to the ned for fast disbursement and implemcntation; and (d) early procurement has been initiated.
11.   Ratonal for IDA Involvement: The Kenya Government's ability to cope with the drought has
been severely constained by the current fragile macroeconomic situation and the limixed budgetary
resources available to mount a meaningfil recovery program. Other donor support to date has been mainly
targeted at relief; IDA would provide some of the necessary resources to deal with the recovery process,
and it is expWected that others will funi additional components of the DRP. The proposed project meets the
criteria for emergency lending, r4mely the need to focus on recovery, the temporary nature of the
emergency, the necessity of short and medium tenn actions, and prospects for mitigating the impact of
fture emergencies. The project also offers scope for testing drought mitigation approaches prior to the
proposed ASAL project scheduled for appraisal in FY94, and for strengthening the district-level institutioral
capacity to cope with drought. The project is consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy discussed by
the Board on December 8, 1992 in the context of the Parastatal Reform and Privatization Technical
Assistance Project.
12.   Issues and Actions: The appraisal mission reached agreement with Government on institutional
argents (including the payment mechanism) to ensure timely implementation of the project. During
negotitions, agreement was reached on the implementation plan for each of the components, including
detailed district health and water action plans, and the items to be included in a mid-term review to be
carried out by January 31, 1994. The OP would monitor distribution of the seeds and provide IDA with a
report detaiing distbution by district. Appointment of the key members of the PMU (project coordinator,
tcnical advisor, procement officer and fiance officer) and the distribution of seeds would be
conditions of Credit effectveness.
13.   Faivfr    - I iW Aspects: The drought has had an adverse enviromental impact on the fragile
ASAL areas, exacbated in some places by an influx of refugees putting further pressure on water facilities
and rangelands. While the complexities of sound environmental management of these areas cannot be
addresd by any short-term intervention, the design of the DRP and the IDA-supported project seeks to
incorporate mitigatory actions within the various components being funded. The water action plan would
set out details of proposed interventions to ensure that due attention is given to appropriate rehabditation and
upgrading and construction of more environmentally sound and more easily maintained water facilities such
as sballow wells and roof catchments. Similarly, the roads component would be designed to prevent erosion
and restore natural water courses. The project also includes a small environment component to provide
rangeland management and other envionmeintal support (para. 6).
14.   Program Objecve Categories: The project would address poverty alleviation by assistin the
drought-stricken populaions in the ASAL areas to regain their livelihoods. Provision of agricultural and
other input (including drugs and vaccines), together with improved drinking water sources for humans and
anias, would improve the food security and health status of the beneficiary populations. The project
would contribute to the environmently sustainable use of the ASAL areas by structuring the recovery
program to ensure com=muty awareness and laying the foundation for fiture interventions.
15.   Benefits: Short-term benefits would arise from restoring the ability of some of the ASAL
populations to regain their economic livelihood, with the ancillary benefit of freeing up resources to the
relief agencies to provide assistance to the chronically food insecure. The repair to water and health
fcilities would relieve suffering, not only from the lack of drinking water, but also from disease resulting
from polluted water supplies and other main illnesse. In addition, in the event of favorable rains, the



5
project would facilitate the rapid recovery of agricultural production. The long-term benefits would be to
increase the resilience of human and livestock populations to cope with drought; to strengthen Government's
capacity to deal with drought; and to lay the foundation for longer-term developmr-nt in the targeted
districts.
16.   RIsks: Ihe main risk would be the contnuation of drought conditions in the ASAL areas. In such
a stuation, additional project focus would need to be given to activities such as repair of water sources to
mitigate some of the adverse consequences. A second risk would be the late arrival of goods and supplies,
given the project's two-year tme horizon. This risk has been minimized by: (a) utilizing funds reallocated
from other Credits to enable early start-up; (b) initiating at appraisal the key procuremen: actions; and (c)
providing the Government with appropriate technical assistance to manage specific contracts. There is a
security risk in parts of the project area, particularly the northernmost regions; given the special attention
Govent is paying to security, this risk is cansidered acceptable. There is a risk, too, that the districts
to be covered, which are the most isolated In the country and have suffered from years of neglect, lack the
institutional capacity to manage the project intventions. The project would address this risk by helping to
strengthen the district structures.
17.   Re      dation. I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Association, and I recommend that the Execuive Directors approve the proposed Credit.

Disbursement Issues
1.    Overall, disbursements of the 24 active investment projects in the Kenya protfolio are
about the same as anticipated under the disbursement profile for such projects, although for the
last two years actual disbursements have lagged by 21 percent in FY91 and 24 percent in FY92.
2.    Two projects financed prior to FY84 (Cr. 1238-KE, Population TI and Cr. 1390-KE,
Secondary Towns) closed on December 31, 1990 but are still showing up in the Schedule D
because of delays in reconciling the balance under the special accounts.
3.    Regarding the Sixth Education Project (1986), which is generally progressing well, the
main source of delay has been the slow tendering and contract award procedures relating to one of
the project components. Slow disbursements on the Animal Health Services Project (1987) are
due in part to the restructuring of the project (which will henceforth provide services through the
private, rather than the public, sector); and in part to IDA being the financier of last resort under
this cofinanced project (hence the IDA funds are disbursed last).
4.    Counterpart funding issues and implementation issues in general will be reviewed with the
Government during, respectively, a Public Expenditure Review and a Country Implementation
Review, both of which are scheduled for the second half of FY93.

TECHNICAL ANNEX
PART k: ECONOMIC ISSUES
A. Background
1.     Trends. After the expansionist period of the late 1970s, fuelled by high coffee and tea
revenues, Kenya has experienced a number of economic crises and a considerable redirection in
its economic growth. Increases in oil prices and a decline in Kenya's terms of trade, combined
with the current recession and the pertinent drought of 1984, and later the 1991 drought which is
still on-going, have resulted in severe pressure on the Government budget. With the low
economic growth rates projected for the coming years, tight budgets will be a key element in all
development planning. As a result, Kenya is facing a constrained macroeconomic situation, a
difficult fiscal position, weak balance of payments and increasing inflationary pressures.
2.     The slow growth of the economy in the last ten years has meant that Government
revenues have not been increasing in relation to expenditure needs and the Government faces
serious constraints in financing the budget. Ordinary revenues, which used to be around 25
percent of GDP in the early 1980s, had fallen to 22 percent by 1984 but stabilized at 23 percent
in 1989/90. Deficits of past years will also have a continuing impact on Government's growing
obligations to service its debt, with debt service cuting into total resources available for
recurrent expenditures. Budgetary deficits and the borrowings to finance them will have to be
restrained further as a result of increasing debt service payments. The targets laid down imply that
these should be reduced to 2 percent of GDP.
3.     These trends in financial stringency have had important repercussions in the use of
Government resources. First, the share of investments as seen in the development budget has
been substntially reduced from 32 percent of the total budget in 1980/81 to 25 percent in
1986/87 and in 1991 stood at 7 percent. As a resut, the available budgetary resources for
development have been spread thinly across a large number of projects intead of being
concentrated on the more important productive and/or emergency high prioriy ones.
4.     Second, funds available for the operation and maintenance of existig services,
inc re and facilities through the recurrent vote have also been declining. This decline in
opertg funds has been further aggravated by the increasing share allocated to salaries because
of increases of the mumbers employed in Government Ministries. Consequently, few resources
are left for operadtg expenditures, leading to a situation where most employees sit around
drawing salaries, but unable to provide efficient services to the public. Ways need to be found
not only to make more funds available for the provision of essent  services and operation and
maintenaee of exist  facilities, but perhap more importaty, for support to activities which
require litle input from Govement services - community/group managed projects are a case in
point.
S.     As total Govenment expenditures will be constrained, any new investments in the ASAL
areas wil have to be finaneed through prioritzation of ministry expenditur and/or additional
resources from donors.



14
6.     The Government is faced with a major challenge. It is clear that economic and financial
management has to be strengthened considerably and that the Government has to undertake a
fundamental restructuring of the economy. This challenge is particularly evident in the
agricultural sector. Kenya's population is predominantly rural (85 percent) and the economy
depends fundamentally on agriculture. Agriculture's contribution to GDP (nearly 30 percent),
and export earnings (about 65 percent) highlight the importance of this sector to the economy as a
whole.
7.    Impact of the Drought. Recent performance of the agriculture sector has been
disappointing and in particular 1991 proved to be a difficult year. The growth rate in its real
value added fell from 4.4 percent in 1988 to 3.4 percent in 1990 and to a negative 1. 1 percent in
1991. The unsatisfactory performance of the sector, despite increases in producer prices, was to
a large part due to late, insufficient and unevenly distributed rains. The weather conditions were
generally unfavorable to farming, discouraging farmers from expanding areas under most
principal crops.
8.     Drought in Kenya during 1991 and 1992 has weakened the ability of people in many
districts to cope and recover from such tragedy. The severity of the drought was mainly felt in
the ASAL, which consttte 80 percent of the land area of the country and are inhabited by about
30 percent of the population. The ASAL poputation, consisting of about 7.5 million people of
whom about 4 million depend on agriculture and 3.5 million on livestock (including about 1
million nomads), are among the most vulnerable in terms of their ability to procure food during
disasters and are also among the most disadvantaged in terms of their access to Government
provided services. This situation has been aggravated by the civil war in Ethiopia and Somalia,
and many years of inadequate investment in public infrastructure. The result is that nearly two
million people in northern Kenya have been exposed to severe famine and loss of livelihood.
9. The overall effect is that there have been substantial declines in the output of most
sgricultura products. Given their lack of resources, a majority of farmers in the ASAL area will
be unable to purchase in the short term necessary agricultural inputs such as planting seed,
fertilizer and chemicals. The prolonged drcught has resulted in families using planting seed for
food and now few reserves remain other than in high potential areas or in pockets within medium
potential areas. As a result, aggregate cereal output, which has fallen by 18 percent in 1990,
declined furter by 14 percent in 1991. Overall maize production is etimated to have fallen from
29.2 million bags in the 1989/90 agricultural year to 25.4 million bags in 1990/91 and further to
22.1 million bags in 1991/92. Maize stocks are at present at a historically low level and the
deficit is being met by imports. Other major agricultura produce which recorded decreases in
output included coffee, milk and sugar which dropped by 22, 8 and 2 percent, respectively.
Also, the volume of exports of horticulural produce declined by 10 percent.
10.    The 1991 long rains (March - June) were generally poor in many parts of the country.
The short rains (October - December 1991) were also unfavorable for agricultural production and
the accumulated rainfall for the season indicates that 18 out of 22 stations (with representative and
continuous records) experienced deficits. In November 1992, a total of 26 districts (some outside
the ASAL area) have been identified by the Ministry of Agriculture, LAvestock Development and
Marketing as requlring assistance for essential cropping inputs before the long rains planting
season commencing in March 1993. Temporary relief was also provided for input supply for the
short rains planting season which commenced in late October 1992.



15
11.    Ihe vulnerability of catte to pasture availability during the prolonged dry weather
(particularly in the ASAL areas) forced farmers to sell a significant portion of their herd. As a
result, total cattle slaughters in the country rose by over 10 and 17 percent, respectively, in 1990
and 1991 to 969 thousand head. Over the same period, the combined slaughter of sheep and
goats Increased by 21 and 12 percent, respectively. However, due to the incapacity to market
large numbers of surplus cattle when drought occurs there are significant income losses both to
the stock owners and the country.
12.    Traditional nomadic grazing systems take advantage of pasture and browse around
temporary water points during the wet season and then move their animal to areas with permanent
water supply during the dry season. The lowering of the water table and the drying-up of
waterholes has resulted in an Increasing reliance on more permanent waterpoints: deep
waterholes; boreholes and springs. The congregation of groups of animals around permanent
water points and for extended dry periods results in range degradation. The destruction of
pastures and drying up of water holes have resulted in cattle losses with mortality rates on average
in the arid zones of about 25 percent through end-September 1992. Recent estimates place this as
high as 40 percent. Based on livestock losses during the current drought this has been calculated
to be two billion Kenya shillings or US$57 million. Livestock deaths are continuing to increase at
an alarming rate in many areas as diseases at epidemic levels take hold.
13.    Marketing of most commodities declined and thus reduced the supply of agricultural raw
meras (milk, beverages, tobacco) which resulted in a slump in growth of manufacturing output
In 1991. Reduced eamings resulted in a decline in input use in maize, beans, and wheat crops
thereby causing a furither reduction in the output of these commodities which then led to a
shortage of these ess   ftods.
14.    Malnutrition, particularly among young children, is widespread. Most of the children
who are under-nourished come from the ASAL districts. There has been a drastic drop in the
nutrition status of pastoraists denied of milk and ability to purchase non-pastoral sources of food
and hence becoming dependent on relief foods. The large drop in livestock prices as livestock
markets are flooded with an over-supply of poor conditioned animals reduces pastoral household
incomes and diminishes their purchasing power. This results in the impoverishment of the
pastoral households and slowing down of all sectors of the local economy. In urn this leads to
crowding of towns and trading cents resulting in poor hygienic conditions and requiring more
long-term dependency on relief.
15.    The FAO/WFP Crop and Food Supply Assessment mission has estimated that two
million people, including 500,000 refugees from countries in the north and east, are now at risk.
Total cereal Imports for 1992/93 are estimated at one million tons, of which food aid would
probably need to be about 500,000 tons. Delayed recognition, by the Government and the
inrational community, of the scale of the impending famine in parts of the ASAL, resulted in a
meager "pipeline of food and other forms of assistance to drought affected parts of Kenya.
16.    Access to safe drinking water for the rural households has declined drastically as
evidenced by the high incidence of water-borne diseases. There has been increased incidence of
diardoeal diseases, acute respiraory infections, tuberculosis, and eye infections resulting in extra
pressure on the already limited local health care services.
17.    Given the centrality of agriculture and agricultural trade to the Kenyan economy,
improvement in the management of this sector must become a top priority. The agricultural



16
sector's vulnerability to adverse weather conditions appears to be increasing. Ihis can be partly
attributed to increased use of marginal land for crop production and the encroachment on water
catchment areas. It would take important administrative and technical effort to support
appropriate contingency action plans. The challenge is further compounded by the fact that a
worsening situation would lead to a deterioration of the already limited potential of the land and
water resources. The livestock sector represents tha backbone of the ASAL economy.
Improvements to range management and the preservation of the resource base are critical to the
ability of communities to survive periods of protracted droughts in these areas. There are also
needs for community education and participation in environment initiatives.
B. Bank Response
18.    Drought Strategy. Drought is a regular feature in the arid and semi-arid areas. Until
recently the local population had been able to cope with the drought and managed to practice a
sustainable farming system. The advent of two decades of strong population growth, sparse
attention to community participation in development, and moreover the severity of the current
prolonged drought have all contributed to undermine the traditional coping methods and weakened
the capacity of rural communities to recover. Urban centers such as Wajir and Mandera clearly
show growth patterns associated with the inability of the rral populations to recover after severe
drought. These towns are also not managed to provide economic alternatives to pastoralism or
rainfed cropping, nor to provide social services that would assist in recovery after severe drought.
Community participation in the identification of their priorities and needs in tackling drought is an
important step in building an understanding of mechanisms to approach drought and handling of
the environment in general.
19.    Any drought strategy has to be part and parcel of the ASAL program. A number of
policies which are of direct concern to achieve the overall objectives of ASAL development are
to: halt land degradation and increase agricultural production; achieve a calculated degree of
swurity of food supply in these areas; and improve the quality of life of the ASAL people.
20.   It is fully recognized that ASALs will not be capable of complete self-sufficiency in
agriculura products, except if the bleakest subsistence conditions would be acceptable.
Consequently, the agricultural economy of ASALs must be linked to other areas as markets for
eventual surplus production of specific items and sources of needed foods and agricultural inputs,
as well as other consumer goods. Since Kenya cannot afford to subsidize large populations in her
ASALs an economic balance between high and low potential areas is necessary.
21.    The objective of the ASAL program can thus be summarized to be the improvement of
the social and economic well-being of the inhabitants of the ASAL areas through development of
the areas' productive potential, creation of income-earning opportuities and provision of basic
needs. Ihe program is intended to be integral in nature and to tap local human resources for
needs identification, program formulation and implementation. Specific objectives include: (a)
development of human resources; (b) exploitation of produ&ctive potential; (c) resource
conservation; and (d) integration of ASAL areas in the nitional economy.
22.    The project is consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy discussed by the Board on
December 8, 1992 in the context of the Parastatal Reform and Privatization Technical Assistance
Project. The proposed project is appropriate to achievement of economic recovery from the
drought in the ASAL areas.



17
PART UI:  SECTOR STRATEGIES
23.    To moet the overall objectives of ASAL development a number of policies for different
sectors exist.
Agriculture and ivestock
24.    The Kenyan economy continues to be dominated by agriculture, and rapid growth of this
sector figures prominently in the Government's overall economic strategy. The performance of
the agriculture sector since independence has been better than the average for Sub-Saharan Africa.
Nevertheless, the agricultural growth rate of 3.5 percent per annum during the 1980s has not been
sufficient to keep up with the high population growth of close to 4 percent per annum.
Consequedy, it has proved difficult to raise per capita income levels and protect the natural
r.aource base. The situation has worsened recently as Kenya's agricultural performance declined
sharply; estimates indicate that the agricultural growth rate in 1991 was negative and the
prognosis for 1992 is not much better. The sector's vulnerability to adverse weather conditions
also appears to have increased. Given this situation, it would take a major managerial and
technical effort, underpinned by an appropriate policy framework, to raise the agricultural growth
rate.
25.    Kenya's agricultural sector has been strong in the past and the potential exists for this
sector to grow at 4 percent per annum. However, the recent performance of the sector is being
severely constrained primarily by structural inadequacies characterized by an inappropriate policy
environment. Externly these include reduced public investment in the sector, inappropriate
public service incentive structures, cumbersome regulatory and procedural systems, as well as
depressed world prices for some important crops. Internally, the sector is characterized by weak
strategic management structures and managerial capabilities. The sector has responded only
sluggishly to dramatic changes in the international agricultural market and to the tightening fiscal
situation in Kenya. This is particularly evidenced by the continued domination of the sector by a
number of poorly managed, inefficient and loss making public sector marketing and distribution
instituions. Together these constraints merge to produce a non-competitive market apparatus and
inadequate producer incentives that are critically influencing the decision of farmers and other
agricultr organizations to develop the sector.
26.    The Government has recognized that a major overhaul of the policy framework and the
incentive structure is urgently needed, along with the encouragement of a more competitive
marketing structure with increased participation of the private sector in all aspects of marketing
and distribution of agricultural commodities. There is also a growing commensurate realization
that to encourage greater private initiative it is necessary to reduce the involvement of parastatals
in the sector. In addition, the Government has also recognized that its capacity to manage the
sector, to make critical policy and operational decisions in a coherent and integrated manner in a
changing policy and operational framework and to identify and to effectively provide key services
to farmers needs to be strengthened. Given the magnitude of the challenge, it is clear that
strengthening both the Government's financial and managerial capacity to develop the agricultural
sector would be a relatively long term effort.
27.    Given the above, the Government's financial and managerial capacity to deal with the
specific problems associated with the development of the ASAL areas is limited at present.
Nevertheless, the Government is in the process of developing a long term integrated program for



18
developing the ASAL districts. Significant progress has been made in formulating an ASAL
policy and developing ASAL district enviroment action plans. The Govermnent has also
prepared a Food Security Action Plan and a Drougbt Contingency Action Plan. These endeavors
have assisted the Government to at least partially respond to the drought related crisis over the
past few months. However, the magnitude and effectiveness of the response was severely
constrained primarily by the lack of financial resources and to some extent by inadequate capacity
to deal with such  major emergency. An ASAL project is scheduled for appraisal in FY94.
Health
28.    The Government's major health objective is to provide health services within easy reach
of Kenyans by the turn of the century, with emphasis on preventive, promotive and rehabilitative
services while not ignoring curative services. In order to achieve this, the Government bas
evolved and is currently pursuing implementation of the following major policies: (i) to increse
coverage and improve accessibility of health services with active community participation; (ii) to
consolidate fi-ther urban and rural curative services; (iii) to further expand and consolidate
maternal and child health and family planning mrvices in order to reduce morbidity, mortality and
fertility; (iv) to strengthen the Ministry of Health (MOH) management capabilities at all levels;
(v) to improve inter-sectoral collaboration with other Ministries, municipalities and NMOs; and
(vi) to expand alternative mechanisms for financing health care programs, including cost recovery
and improvements to the National Hospital Insurance Fund.
29.    To address the broad range of issues facing the sector, key elements of the Government's
strategy will be to increase budgetary allocations to preventive/promotive and primary health
services while attempting to improve management, drug procurement and the refer  system, and
developing and implementing an effective public health sector investment progrm. The
Government's overall strategy and policies for the health sector are appropriate. Since no
significant increase in public spending on health can be expected over the short to medium term,
sustahiable improvements in the quality and coverage of health services will only be possible
through a more efficient allocation and management of existing resources, as well as the
implementation of effective and equitable cost-sharing policies. With an appropriate policy
framework in place, attention will need to focus on implementation capacity within Government,
especially MOH. In this respect, Government efforts will need to concentrate on: (i) reallocation
of resources in line with priorities placed on preventive/promotive and rural health services; (ii)
implementation of user-charge policies and improvements in health insurance; (iii) improving the
efficiency of the health system, especially curative services; and (iv) strengthening planning and
administration of the system.
30.    An important principle underlying the introduction of user charges is that they will
generate additional resources for the sector. In this way, additional resources within the sector
can be used to meet allocative and efficiency objectives. District Medical Officers and the
District Health Management Tean will be responsible for allocating additional resources in line
with epidemiological and district priorities. A critical issue will be the ability of district managers
to allocate resources effectively and efficiently. The weakness of the current district plans and the
lack of accurate management and financial information will limit the capacity of district planners
to effectively implement overall policies.
Infrastucture
31.    Most of Kenya's rural areas are poorly served by all-weather roads. During the last two
years the influx of refugees and heavy vehicles deployed for relief operations have accelerated the



19
deterioration process of earth and gravel roads in the drought affected areas. The great
difficulties in making available relief supplies by road poses a great cost to agencies who have to
revert to expensive air transport. The implicit higher costs of relief which the Government and
other agencies incur results in a reduced supply of essential goods, public health supplies, and
food. This poses a serious threat to public health and the well being of the ASAL dwellers. In
the arid areas no road development work of any significance is in progress nor in the pipeline.
32.    Government focus has been maWiy on rehabilitation of both bitumen and gravel roads
which have been confined to high potential areas. Future socio-economic development of the
rural areas in particular the ASAL will have to be based on marketing of livestock products from
and the transport of consumer goods to these districts. As such, Government attention would be
on (J) restoring access from the districts to high potential areas of the country by improving
marketing routes for trucking for the inflow and outflow of goods and services, (ii) selected
district roads connecting major population centers, for transport of food, farm inputs and other
services, (iii) roads providing easier access to better range lands with a hope of reducing
pressures on poor and marginal range conditions.
33.    The Ministry of Public Works (MOPW) has been responsible for the construction and
mainance of all classified roads in the country through their District Works Officers (DWOs)
and the District Development Committees (DDCs). The existing capacities at the districts have
been insufficient to cope with the increasing volume of road maintenance. As a consequence most
earh and gravel roads (which constitute about 91 percent of the network) are inaccessible during
the rainy season, isolating most districts from the rest of the country. The MOPW states that
owing to financial constraints, road maience operations have been limited and consequently
most earth/gravel roads become inaccessible during wet conditions. Current Government budget
allocations for road maintenance have been far from adequate and as per MOPW estimates, were
only 14 percen of the benchmark requirements for the most essential road maintenance activities,
excluding labor. The low level of Government's budget allocation and their increasing overheads
have restricted the optimal maintenace of the road network (an average of US$250 per km per
annum for all classified roads of which over 60 percent is utilized for District and HQ
administrtion). The MOPW would have to address the need for reducing its wage bill
considerably to provide an even spread of the available resources and review other cost sharing or
revenue raising alternatives.
Water
34.    At present the Ministry of Land Reclamation, Regional and Water Development
(MOLRRWD) has overall responsibility for the water sector, with regulatory and policy making
authority as well as responsibility for nationwide and multi-district water project planning and
implementation. At the district level the office of the District Water Engineer (DWE) acts as the
main arm of the MOLRRWD. Under the District Focus for Rural Development Policy of 1983,
the District offices are vested with responsibility for planning, monitoring and implementation of
all water projects and programs within the geographical boundaries of the District. The National
Water Conservation and Pipeline Corporation (NWCPC), a parastatal organization, was
established in 1988 to operate piped urban and rural water schemes on a commercial basis
although their operations in the ASAL are limited. In addition, some municipal schemes are still
operated by municipal councils under the Ministry of Local Government.
35.    Availability of water resources in the ASAL is highly problematic. In almost half of the
area, average rainfall is less than 300 mm per annum. It is estimated that in Kenya as a whole,



20
15 percent of the rural and 78 percent of the urban population have access to improved water
supplies. The corresponding figures for the ASAL are not known but can be assumed to be well
below the national average. Given the importance of water for the development of the ASAL
considerable efforts have been made in the past to construct water systems in these areas, these
largely consisting of diesel or electric powered piped water systems and boreholes. Run-off
catchment dams and pans have also been constructed forming a vital source of water particularly
for livestock. However, a large proportion of existing water systems no longer function whilst
many dams and pans are silting up, holding less and less water for increasingly shorter time
spans.
36.    There are several reasons for the above problems. Many of the systems were constructed
15 to 25 years ago and are reaching the end of their design life. Furthermore most of the systems
are serving significantly higher numbers of users than they were originally designed for, leading
to rapid deterioration and subsequent breakdowns. Above all problems have arisen as a result of
poor operational support and inadequate or non-existent maintenance. This in turn stems largely
from a lack of funds and organizational capability at the district government level where few
resources are available to cover day to day eperational costs or to replace ageing equipment and
vehicles. Also the dispersed nature of rural settlements and water points makes it costly and
logistically difficult to monitor the operation of such schemes, and to take timely measures when
breakdowns occur.
37.    These problems have induced the Government to revise their approach to the sector.
Cost-sharing, whereby users are required to contribute to operation and maintenance costs, is
being increasingly encouraged. However, this has not yet been widely enforced in the ASAL.
Users not only tend to perceive public water systems as being the responsibility of the
Government, but there is reluctance to make any kind of financial contribution when the services
provided continue to be unreliable or non-existent. In order to improve operation and maintenance
and thus ensure greater reliability, the policy of the Government is to increasingly devolve actal
management of water systems to the level of communities themselves with the MOLRRWD
assuming a regulatory and facilitating role. However, it has proved difficult to persuade
communities to assume responsibility for facilities on which they were not consulted at the time of
construction. ITus there is now a renewed recognition of the need to involve communities fully in
the planning stages of any construction or rehabilitation of water points so as to instill a sense of
ownership and responsibility for the systems that are installed. There is also a recognition of the
need to promote the use of technologies that communities can manage and sustain in the long term
with minimum external support.
38.    High concentrations of livestock around a limited number of water points has resulted in
overgrazing of pasture lands around these points. Ibis in turn has led to an increased awareness
of the need for the development of environmental protection approaches as an integral p xt of
water supply design and that the planning, implementing and managing of water for domestic,
livestock and food/fodder production needs to be carried out in an integrated manner. This also
requires close collaboration between the many actors involved in water supply development.
Recent positive action at district level to this end has been the coordinating initiative of
MOLRRWD to more efficiently meet the water development needs of the ASAL. Measures have
been taken in some districts to establish coordinating units at district level gathering all
participants including MOLRRWD, line ministries, NGOs and others working within the sector to
ensure proper linkages and complementarity in the implementation of activities in the water
sector.

PART III:  THE PROJECT
A. Detaled Project Description
39.    An IDA mission visited Kenya between November 22 and December 10, 1992 in
response to the request of the Government of Kenya for assistance with an Emergency Drought
Recovery Ptoject. A Credit and Project Summary is provided at the beginning of this report.
There is no Staff Appraisal Report. Negotiations were held in Nairobi January 20-22, 1993. The
Kenya delegation was led by Mr. W. K. K. Kimalat, Permanent Secretary in the Office of the
President.
40.    Project Objectives. The proposed project would fund specific components of the DRP
and would have two main objectives: ff) to alleviate the impact of the current drought through
measures which will start to regenerate productive capacity in agriculture and livestock production
for the ASAL populations, and to improve water supply and basic health services, and provide
access to and within the arid districts of Mandera, Marsabit and Turkana; and Oi) to assist in
enhancing institutional capacity at the district level to deal with drought. The long-term objective
is to begin the process of taclding the underlying causes which make ASAL populations
Increasingly vulnerable to drought situations.
41.    Components. The following criteria were used in determining the components: (i)
ability to target a package of investments to benefit victims of the drought; (ii) implementable
within the current operational constraints and within a project period of 24 months; and (iii) be in
response to the DRP and be incremental to ongoing and planned Govermnent and donor
assistance. ITe project has six main components: (i) agriculture, (ii) livestock, (iii) drought
management, including environment, (iv) water supply, (v) road rehabilitation and (vi) health.
42.    Project Ares The ASAL area is composed of two agro-ecological zones: arid and semi-
arid. In the arid zones, population densities are low, water resources scarce, rangelands degraded
and nomadic pastoralism predominates. The arid zones encompass the districts of Mandera,
Wajir, Ga issa, Marsabit, Turkana, Isiolo, Tana River and Samburu. The semi-arid zones have
higher population densities and agro-pastoralism is the main way of life. The districts in this zone
are: Baringo, Laikipia, West Pokot, Iharaka Nithi, Kitui, Machakos, Makueni and Nakurm. It
should be noted, nowever, that other districts of Kenya not u sually classified as ASAL areas have
been affected by drought. The project area is defined as the ASAL districts, with special attention
being given to the three arid districts of Mandera, Marsabit and Turkana for an integrated
package of interventions for water, health and road rehabilitation. Tana River, which has
received little assistance to date, will also be assisted to build its institutional capacity.
43.    Agricuiture. The objective of the agricultural component is to ensure availability of
seasonal inputs for the 1993 planting season. The impact of two successive years of drought has
depleted seed supply. It has been estimated by the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock
Development and Marketing that about 500,000 farm families in the ASAL areas will need
assistance. The packge envisaged, for free distribution, would consist of seed, fertilizer and
chemicals to plant an area of about half a hectare and would cost an estimated US$29. A limited
number of hand tools would also be made available. The total requirements for these targeted
farmers in the ASAL areas are some 10,000 tons of maize, sorghum, beans, cowpeas and
vegetable seeds; 24,000 tons of fertilizer; 400 tons of pesticides; and 80,000 sets of hoes and



22
pangas. FAO is providing assistance through the UN DMT in the coordination of possible donor
interventions.
44.    The components, estimated base cost US$7.5 million equivalent, would be financed from
amendments to existing IDA Credits (US$4.5 million), from the proposed IDA Credit (US$0.7
million) and by the Government of Kenya (local currency equivalent of US$2.3 million).
(a)         Provision of 15,000 tons of fertilizer and transport to the project area
(US$4.5 million).
(b)         Provision of hand tools and transport to the project area (US$0.7 million).
(c)         Provision of maize, sorghum, beans, cowpeas and vegetable seeds and
transport to the project area (US$2.3 million).
45.    Distribution, based on need, would be the responsibility of the District Famine Relief
Committees. Ihis method was used successfully for a smaller distribution during the short rains
in 1992. The Office of the President (OP) would monitor the distribution of the seeds and
provide IDA with a report detailing distribution by district. The project would finmce the cost of
this work. The distribution of seeds would be a condition of effectiveness (para. 99).
46.    Livestock. The prolonged failure of rains has severely impacted on the livestock
populations in many of the ASAL districts in Kenya. Destruction of pastures and the drying up
of water holes have resulted in substantial livestock losses. Conservative estimates indicate
livestock mortality rates through the end of September 1992 of about 25 percent for catte, 20
percent for sheep and 10 percent for goats in the six arid districts of Turkana, Marsabit,
Mandera, Wajir, Garissa and Tana River. Recent estimates point to an increasing trend of losses,
eecially among cattle, with estimates as high as 40 percent.
47.    The drought has also resulted in the surviving livestock populations becoming
progressively weaker and increasingly susceptible to disease. The incidence of endemic and
contagious diseases such as Contagious Bovine Pleuropneumonia (CBPP), Rinderpest, Caprine
Pleuropneumonia (CPP) and Lumpy Skin Disease (LSD) has progressively increased in spite of
efforts by the Department of Veterinary Services (DVS) to conduct a vaccination campaign. In
addition, the drought has also severely weakened the ability of the cattle population to resist
trypanosomiasis, leading to an increase in the incidence of that disease. Ihe DVS' efforts have
been hampered by the lack of vaccines, trypanocidal drugs, other clinical drugs and resources to
mount and maintain an effective animal health campaign. A major first step in assisting the
recovery process of ASAL populations dependent on livestock is to improve the general level of
health of the surviving animal populations, both to prevent further losses due to disease and to
increase their productivity.
48.     The project would finance the purchase of vaccines, trypanocidal drugs, clinical drugs,
vaccination equipment and other consumable and operating costs associated with carrying out
vaccination and animal treatment programs in the districts of Mandera, Marsabit, Turkana, Wajir,
Garissa, Tana River, Isiolo, Samburu, Baringo and Laikipia.
49.    The components, estimated base cost US$2.5 million equivalent, would be financed from
amendments to existing IDA Credits.



23
(a)         Provision of vaccines, trypanocidal and clinical drugs, vaccination
equipment and other veterinary supplies (US$2.2 million).
Qb)         Operating costs for the campaigns (US$0.3 million).
50.    The animal health component would be implemented by the DVS, using its own staff.
Vaccination teams would be established in each of the targeted districts. Each team would consist
of a veterinary officer, four animal health assistants and two drivers. Two campaigns, each of 60
days, would be conducted In each district. The trypanocidal and clinical drugs would be
distributed to the District Veterinary Officer's (DVO) office. The DVO would be responsible for
organizing and carrying out the animal treatment programs. The district coordinator would work
with the DVO in deciding priority areas for carrying out the animal health programs.
51.    Drought Mangement. The Government has recognized the importance of having an
Institutional framework for management of droughts which ensures a capacity to secure the
availability of foodstuffs and the speedy recovery from the adverse effects of drought. The
districts and local communities should be mobilized within this framework to manage specific
drought management activities like food for work, livestock for work, identification of households
for restocking, and participation in the recommendations stemming from analyses of climatic and
economic data
52.    Infmation and district data on such indicators as crop performance, market surveys,
rainfal, livestock and pasture conditions and household performance would be continuously
collected and analyzed. This data would form the basis for a drought monitoring system which
would be used to generate operational options to assist food security objectives. The drought
management component should also be seen as a part of a longer term program which would
eventually dovetail into the ASAL project.
53.    Within the three districts selected (Mandera, Marsabit and Turkana) for establishing the
drought management system, strengthening is needed through the appoinent and training of the
district coordinators to provide coordination of the activities of the line ministries and to liaise
effectively with the district commissioner and the PMU (para. 82). The project would finance six
man months of short-term technical assistance to facilitate project implementation and to assist in
the training of key staff. Short-erm special local training and seminars for district coordinators
and allowances for staff of line ministries involved In the implementation of the program would
also be financed. A local management and training consultant or institute would train project staff
and community leaders in data collection, drought monitoring, famine relief, administration
concepts and methods. To support project financial accountability, an accounts clerk position
would be created in each district, under the supervision of the finance manager in the PMU. In
addition, each district would be provided with four vehicles, five motorcycles, and rehabilitation
and refurnishing of houses and offices for incumbent staff. Various types of equipment
(computers, radio telecommunication systems, photcopiers), contract staff and field trip
allowances would also be financed under the project. A limited program would also be
imple_mte in Tana River.
54.    Evfronmnent. Preservation of the resource base is critical to the ability of communities
to survive periods of droughts. The aim of this component is to test different approaches to the
protection of water points and the establishment of grass seed bulking plots in areas of poor
rangeland so as to relieve pressure on the range resources. In addition, a limited program of
mini-spate diversion for collection and spreading of water would be constructed with the objective



24
of increasing the availability of livestock fodder. Support would also be provided for livestock
extension at the district level.
55.    Water point protection - Financial support for labor and fencing materials would be
provided to 36 selected temporary surface water dams/pans to enclose an average area of one
hectare. Fencing would prevent or limnit access and depending on particular sites water would be
pumped and piped to troughs outside the protected area. Concrete wall protection of appropriate
sites would also be tested.
56.    Seed plots - Within the identified areas of poor rangeland condition, in each district ten
sites would be selected for establishing grass seed propagation plots. Approximately one hectare
would be securely fenced on the windward side of open degraded areas and over sowed with
indigenous perennial grass seed including a mixture of Cenchrus, Leptothrium, Chrysopogon,
Dactyloctenium, Enteropogon and Sporobolus spp. A source for this seed would be the Griftu
pastoral training center in Wajir District. Apart from the initial fencing and introduction of seed,
these plots would then be essentially maintenance free.
57.    Mini-spate Divesions - Seven sites for mini-spate diversion of seasonal surface flows
(four in Turkana (in Lokitaung, Kakuma and Turkwell Divisions) and one each in Mandera,
Marsabit and Tana River) would be selected with appropriate guidance from short-term technical
assistance. Ihe feasibility study previously conducted by NORAD in Turkana would be used as
the basis and short-erm national technical assistance would be funded to lay out the contours and
identify areas to be installed. Costs of tools, labor and field allowances for supervision would be
fianced under the project.
58.    Range Extension - Support would be provided at divisional level to enable greater field
mobility range of extension officers. Two four wheel drive vehicles would be rehabilitated in
each district and provided with fuel and vehicle operating expenses to enable livestock extension
officers more regular access to communities involved in component activities and to increase
extension capability into other areas. Range extension activities would be monitored by the
distict coordinators to ensure coordination in delivery of messages.
59.    Other environmental support would also be provided for revegetation, woodlands and
environmental education. Revegetadon and woodlands support would be in the form of supplying
necessary nursery materials and fencing to enable degenerated areas around water points and
towns to be planted with fast growing trees and shrubs. The cost of community labor for fencing
and seedling production would be met by the project, with the cost of labor for planting being the
community's contribution. In association with the communities, three water points in each district
would be selected by the district enviroment officer. One town community per district would
also be selected to have areas fenced and allowed to regenerate naturally. Also, three town
communities would be selected for support to fence areas close to town for establishment of
woodlands.
60.    Environment Education - The aim would be to conduct seminars in each of the four
districs to create community awareness for the environment and train district officers in rapid
rural appraisal techniques. The project would meet the cost of transport and accommodation of
resource persons, local consultants and seminar costs for participants.
61.    The Drought Management and Environment components, estimated base cost US$2.65
million equivalent, would be financed from the proposed IDA Credit.



25
(a)          Protection and rehabilitation of district buildings and development of
environmental works (US$0.7 million).
(b)          Provision of vehicles and equipment (US$0.6 million).
(c)          Provision of training and short term technical assistance (US$0.3 million).
(d)          Operating expenses for transport and field allowances (US$1.05 million).
62.    Infrasructure. During the last two years the influx of refugees and heavy vehicles
deployed for relief operations has accelerated the deterioration process of earth and gravel roads
in the drought affected areas. The existing capacities of the districts have been insufficient to
cope with the increasing volume of road maintenance. As a consequence most earth and gravel
roads (which constitute about 90 percent of the network) are inaccessible during the rainy season,
Isolating most districts from the rest of the country. Field visits have confirmed that over 70
percent of the classified roads in the arid districts are in need of repair and rehabilitation.
63.    The infrastructure component of the project would finance limited critical road
rebabilitation (421 kn) of earth and gravel roads in the three selected districts of Mandera,
Marsabit and Turkana to facilitate recovery from the effects of the recent drought. The main
focus would be on (i) restoring access from the districts to high potential areas of the country by
improving marketing routes for trucking for the inflow and outflow of goods and services, (ii)
selected district roads connecting major population centers, for transport of food, farm inputs and
other services, (iii) roads providing easier access to better rangelands with a hope of reducing
pressures on poor and marginal range conditions - linkage with the water component of the
project would be established.
64.    To assist in restoring road maintenance capacity at the district level the project would
also finance the rehabilitation of selected unserviceable equipment and purchase of spare parts
such as tires and tubes and fast moving items. This would reduce pressure on the already low
level of fiunding by Government and could result in a larger proportion of the allocation being
utilized for operation of the road maintenance equipment. Owing to long distances the road
mantenance units have to travel, provision has been made for the purchase of basic camping
materls so that travel time and costs could be reduced to a minimum.
65.    The project would also finance three studies to evaluate additional infrastructure
requirements in the ASAL districts. These would include (i) telecommunication improvements,
(ii) other infrastructure requirements, such as storage facilities at divisional level, primary,
secondary and technical schools, dispensaries and hospitals, airstrips, market places,
slaughterhouses, etc; and (iii) an in-house study by MOPW to evaluate road rehabilitation needs
in the ASAL districts.
66.    The components, estimated base cost US$7.5 million equivalent, would be financed from
the proposed IDA Credit.
(a)          Three private contracts for road rehabilitation (US$ 6.55 million).
(b)          Provision of spare parts for rehabilitation of vehicles and equipment, and
camping equipment (US$0.45 million).



26
(c)         Preparation of work and supervision bid documents and the supervision of
the three contracts, and studies for communications, other infrastructure
requirements and road rehabilitation needs in the ASAL districts (US$0.50
million).
67.    Water. The prolonged drought and the influx of refugees and livestock from
neighboring countries have significantly increased the pressure on water supply facilities, mainly
boreholes, in the northern arid areas which has led to a serious level of breakdowns. The focus
of the project would therefore initially be to alleviate the water shortage by rehabilitating existing
(mainly permanent) water facilities in the three most drought affected districts of Mandera,
Marsabit and Turkana. In addition support would be provided through the project to strengthen
the capacities of the MOLRRWD and community groups, and to carry out a limited program in
Tana River.
68.    Besides rehabilitating boreholes, development of new water sources would focus on, for
example, construction and upgrading of traditional shallow wells and roof and rock catchment
systems which would be both more environmentally sound and also constitute a technology choice
more appropriate to the Govermnent policy of handing over operation and maintenance of water
facilities to community groups. In line with Government policies, significant consideration would
be given to training of community groups to manage water sources. Similar support would also
be provided to NGOs active in the districts. Further capacity building under the project vwould
address MOLRRWD needs as regards rehabilitation of vehicles and some plant and equipment to
enable them to assist water facility users in maintaining the facilities.
69.    All three districts rely on boreholes as the main permanent water source. Traditional
shalow wells are largely under-developed. The Daua Parma river in Manderm, along the
Ethiopian border, including boreholes serves the Mandera/Rhamu area. The best potential for
groundwater exploitation, including shallow wells, is in the eastern Finno-El Wak area. In
Marsabit shallow wells can be developed in the alluvial sediments of seasonal rivers. Although
pans and dams constitute an important water resource in some parts of the district the potential is
limited due to permeable substratum. In Turkana, where there has only been limited donor
assistance in recent years, the potential for shallow well development is to be found mainly in the
basins of the Kerio and Turkwell rivers.
70.    Detailed action plans have been prepared for each district. They contain information on
the objectives, strategy, ongoing activities in the district, outputs, and the program of work and
its implementation, as well as details on contracts to be undertaken by NGOs, private contractors
and MOLRRWD. These action plans were agreed upon at negotiations.
71.    Capacity building support would also be provided to the r.maining four priority districts
(Garissa, Isiolo, Samburu and Wajir) by rehabilitating MOLRRWD vehicles, plant and equipment
at a cost of US$0.1 million per district and the provision of three water tankers to initially meet
temporary water needs and to assist the various works to be carried out in the project area.
72.    The components, estimated base cost US$5.15 million equivalent, would be financed
from the proposed IDA Credit.
(a)         Rehabilitation of boreholes, pans and dams (US$2.1 million).
(b)         Provision of equipment for rehabilitation works, spare parts and
rehabilitation of existing vehicles and equipment (US$2.0 million).



27
(c)         Technical assistance, training and community-based operations (US$0.35
million).
(d)         Provision of three water tankers (US$ 0.3 million).
(e)         Operating expenses, including transport costs (US$0.4 million).
73.    The link between the central PMU and the District Development Committee will be
through the district coordinator (para. 83). This coordinator would, in dealing with the water
component, work closely with the DWE and the district water coordinating unit. Implementation
wIll be carried out pardy through the DWE's staff and pardy through contracting. For the
success of the project it is imperative that the community groups are involved in both planning
and implementation as they have vast experience and knowledge about the needs and priorities as
regards water. Many community groups have also shown significant willingness to contribute both
in cash and in kind to the development and operation and maintenance of the water points.
74.    Health. The drought has placed an increasing strain on the basic health services in the
ASAL areas. This has been exacerbated in certain border districts by the influx of refugees. UN
organizations, NCGOs and church groups are significant contributors to the nrual and urban health
service. Constraints in Government funds are a major reason for the declining service.
However, there are a number of insttutional problems due to the remoteness of these areas from
Nairobi, which also discourages continuity of service of medical staff.
75.    The objective of the intervention would be: (i) to strengthen the capacity of the health
services in the three districts of Mandera, Marsabit and Turkana, and (ii) to provide focus to deal
with the main illnesses of malaria, diarrhea and respiratory tract diseases. A limited capacity
building program would also be started in Tana River and a project monitoring mechanism
established by MOH. Preventive, as well as curative, focus would be given.
76.    The project would fund rehabilitation of buildings, equipment and vehicles; additional
equipment and vehicles; drugs and medical supplies; vector control and non pharmaceutical
supplies. On the job training and training of community groups would also be supported.
Detailed action plans have been prepared for each of the three districts and Tana River; these set
out the objectives, strategy, outputs, ongoing activities of others in the district, the program,
separate project inventory and accounts of supplies and distribution by location, implementation
arrangements and a summary of the interventions and cost. These action plans were agreed upon
at negotiations.
77.    The components, estimated base cost US$2.0 million equivalent, would be financed from
the proposed IDA Credit.
(a)         Provision of vehicles and equipment (US$0.75 million).
(b)         Provision of drugs and medical supplies (US$0.40 million).
(c)         Training (US$0.15 million).
(d)         Rehabilitation of buildings (US$0.55 million).
(e)         Operating expenses (US$0.15 million).



28
78.    Projed Managanent Unit. The PMU secretariat would be the central implementation
unit (para. 82) and would be situated in separate offices. It would be staffed with senior local
contract staff (project coordinatot, deputy project coordinator, finance manager, procurement
officer and support staff) and an internationally recruited advisor. Provision has been made for
short term technical assistance for monitoring as well as adequate transport, office equipment and
associated operational support.
79.    The components, estimated base cost US$1.1 million equivalent, would be financed from
the proposed IDA Credit (US$0.85 millon) and amendments to existing IDA Credits (US$0.25
million).
(a)         Provision of vehicles and equipment (US$0.20 million)
(b)         Operating costs, including contract staff, office expenses and air charter
(US$0.65 million).
(c)         Technical assistance and training (US$0.25 million).
B. INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS
80.    lmplementation. The objective of the project is drought recovery and as such a
structure is required which allows marimum efficiency of implementation while working within
the Government framework to ensure continuity of operations after the end of the project period.
81.    The organogram (Appendix I) indicates both the existing Government structures relating
to drought relief and management and the agreed project implemenaion structure. The project
would be implemented under the National Famine Relief Coordinating Committee in the Office of
the President (OP), which is chaired by the Secretary to the Cabinet and Head of the Public
Service. A Special Recovery Team (SRI) consisting of representatives of the OP, Treasury,
Office of the Vice-President and Ministry of Planning and National Development (Head of Rural
Planning Development), and the Chairman of the UN DMT would be responsible for overall
planning, coordination and monitoring, and would give policy guidance to the PMU.
82.    The PMU would have overall responsibility for realizing the DRP and project objectives
and outputs. It would also assist in promoting institutional capacity for the longer-term
framework of ASAL development. It would be composed of senior representatives of the
concerned line ministries, OP, and representatives of participating donors. The PMU would have
a Secretariat headed by a project coordinator, together with a deputy project coordinator,
procurement and finance officers and four district coordinators. Three of the district coordinators
would be based in the main focus districts (Mandera, Marsabit and Turkana), and the fourth in
Tana River where the main emphasis would be on capacity building. Tle deputy project
coordinator would support field activities in the other four arid districts. A technical advisor,
who would be an international specialist in arid and semi-arid lands, would also be recruited as a
member of the PMU Secretariat and would assist the project coordinator in implementation of the
project. The project coordinator would also serve as secretary of the SRT. Appointment of the
PMU Secretariat management team (project coordinator, technical advisor, procurement officer
and finance officer) would be a condition of effectiveness (para. 99).



29
83.    At the district level the district coordinator, reporting directly to the project coordinator,
would provide the focal point for project activities. The district coordinator would act as
Chairman of the District Drought Recovery Steering Group (DDRSG), which is a sub-committee
of the District Development Committee. The DDRSG would consist of representatives from the
pardcipating line ministries, relevant donors, NGOs and community representatives and would
assume responsibility for coordination of project activities and other drought development
programs in the district.
84.    The PMU Secretariat would be supported with office equipment, transport and
communications, and supported with secretarial staff. Each district coordinator would be
equipped with transport and communication facilities and supported by a secretary and accounts
clerk.
85.    Payment Mechanism. The payment mechanism described below is in addition to the
direct payment system already operating for other IDA-funded projects and deals primarily with
district level payments.
86.    The project cost would be voted under a separate account head under the OP. Funds
would be administered by the Accounting Officer (AO) in the OP. An off-shore Special Dollar
Account (SDA) would be established, to be used for overseas payments and reimbursement of
local expenses. A separate Paymaster General (PMG) Account would also be opened to facilitate
remittances to the districts.
87.    The district coordinators would incur expenditure against authorizations to incur
expenditures issued to them and submit original documents to the district treasury for payment
(retaining a copy for records). The district accountant would arrange payment, analyze the
expenditure under budget heads and submit weekly reimbursement claims to the PMG along with
copies of paid vouchers and supporting documents. The PMG would process the claims and
forward them to the Extn  Resources Division (ERD) in Treasury who would arrange to
transfer the amount payable from the PMG account to the exchequer account every week. ERD
would also arrange for replenishment of the PMG account from the off-shore SDA every two
weeks. This system would ensure payments to districts on sight immediately on receipt of weekly
claims by the PMG. At the OP, the AO would incur expenditures as per normal Government
procedures and submit special exchequer requisitions through ERD to seek transfers from the
PMG account. District coordinators would send copies of paid vouchers and supporting
documents to the PMU along with a monthly summary of accounts. The PMU would maintain
books of accouns and prepare reports for Government and donors, and certification of statements
of expenditure.
88.    The actual operation of the above payment mechanism would be reviewed by IDA three
months from the date of Credit effectiveness and suitably modified, if necessary, in consultation
with Government. At the time of the mid-term review, a more comprehensive evaluation of the
payment mechanism would be made by IDA (para. 96).
89.   FInacing Plan. The proposed project would be financed as follows:
IUS$ Mllion
Government of Kenya                            2.30
IDA - Proposed Credit                          20.00
IDA - Amendments to Existing Credits           7.25
TOTAL                                  2=.



30
The amounts from the IDA Credits which have been amended are US$2.5 million from the
Animal Health Services Project (Cr. 1758-KE); US$2.75 million from the Rural Services Design
ProJect (Cr. 1974-KE); and US$2.0 million from the Second National Agricultural Extension
Project (Cr. 2199-XE). The components to be funded fall within the objectives of the respective
Credits: (i) Cr. 1758-KE, to Improve effective delivery of animal health services; (ii) Cr. 1974-
KE, to resolve constraints to agricultural development; and (iii) Cr. 2199-KE, to increase
productivity and incomes of smallholder farmers. Government would finance the total seed
procurement as its 10 percent contribution to the project (para. 44). The Credit would finance
100 percent of all the other expenditures net of duties and taxes. All items specifically for the
project would be exempt from customs duties and taxes. No physical contingencies have been
included and price contingencies (US$1.15 million) represent about 6 percent of the base cost.
The project would be implemented over a two-year period.
Procurement
90.    All procurement of goods, works and services would be in accordance with World Bank
Procurement Guidelines; consultants would be recruited in accordance with World Bank
Guidelines on Use of Consultants. Bank's sample bidding documents for good, works and
consultants would be used. Procurement methods are summarized in Schedule B and include
price contingencies. About 70 percent of total procurement would follow International
Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures. Procurement of civil works, esfimated at US$1.65
million, covering those project components which are labor intensive and scattered in remote
locations and for which NGOs and certain international agencies like UNICEF have set up their
operating units, would be by shopping procedures . Foreign firms would not be interested in
ihese works. Because of the emergency nature of the project, procurement activities would have
to be completed as soon as possible. The project provides for agricultural inputs (certain hand
tools and other small accessories for farmers) and equipment and spares for support to other
entities to be procured under Local Competitive Bidding (LCB) and local shopping procedures in
aggregate amount not to exceed US$0.85 million and US$0.15 million, respectively. Details of
consultants contracts and other specific procurement activities and procedures are described for
each component in the following summary:
Agriculture (US$0.7 mUilion). The agriculture component of the project would fund the
importation and distribution of hand tools and small amounts of other inputs. Due to the need for
urgent supply and farmer requirements for locally available tools, these would be procured by
LCB. Adequate local competition exists.
Drought Managent and Environment (US$2.7 mllion). The total cost includes US$0.9
million for the environment sub-component which would be implemented under the supervision of
district coordinators in association with line ministries. Construction of fencing around water
points and other small works of rehabilitation of housing estimated at US$0.3 million would be
procured by LCB where adequate local competition exists. Building and fencing materials
(US$0.4 million) and vehicles and equipment (US$0.65 million) would be procured by the PMU
using ICB procedures and supplied to the disticts. The services of local and foreign Consultants
estimated to cost US$0.30 million, would be arranged under World Bank Guidelines on Use of
Consultants. Training cost of US$0.1 million would be incurred based on the training program
approved by IDA.



31
Infrastrucure (US$8.15 million). The infrastructure component of the project would fund
Ihnited critical road rehabilitation of classified earth and gravel roads in three packages (US$7.2
million). Tle bidding documents, to be issued under ICB, would allow the prospective bidders to
bid for any one or all packages. Provision has been made for appointment of a consulting firm
for the preparation of design and supervision bidding documents and to carry out construction
supervision and other related services (estimated at US$0.5 million). MOPW will assist the PMU
in the management of this component. Camping equipment for use of the supervision team would
also be provided. In order to rehabilitate existing road maintenance equipment available in the
Ministry, provision has been made for supply of essential spares, including tires, tubes and
batteries. While general items like tires, tubes and batteries would be procured under ICB,
spares of proprietary nature would be purchased using single source suppliers, up to a total
amount not exceeding US$O.1 million. Tie road work is expected to be completed by March
1995. Local consulting firms would be engaged under World Bank Guidelines on Use of
Consutants.
Water (US$5.5 million). The water component would include upgrading and rehabilitation of
boreholes, training local staff in the operation and maintenance of engines and pumps and in
handling boreholes, emergency repairs, rehabilitation of shallow wells, roof and rock catchments
and pans. Provision is also made for support to MOLRRWD to rehabilitate the existing
equipment used in the construction and ma_nenance of earth pans/dams. An action plan has been
prepared giving the detailed specifications and quantities of various inputs required, and details of
civil works to be contracted in the four districts (para. 70). Provision is made for supply of three
water tankers to be procured under ICB to overcome the prevailing acute shortage of drinking
water in the three focur districts. The PMU would arrange procurement and supply of equipment
spares to MOLRRWD, based on ihe action plan. Provision is also made for adequate training of
MOLRRWD staff at the district level by hiring the services of specialists and consultants. The
major input supply would materialize in the first year of the project. A major part of civil works
at the district level would be undertaken during the second year of the project, partly through
DWE staff and pardy by contracting NGOs and/or private contractors.
Becase of the urgency and limited time for completion, it is expected that the bulk of the
rehabilitation program would be carried out by NGOs who have established their operating units
in most districts in the ASAL area. They have the expertise and supporting facilities to complete
the work on a time bound basis. Thus rehabilitation work in respect of boreholes, pans and dams
would be by local shopping procedures for a total value not to exceed US$1.65 million. Each
contract is not exected to exceed US$40,000 equivalent. NGOs would be selected by shortlisting
procedures. Consultant firms would be engaged under World Bank Guidelines on Use of
Consultants at an estimated cost of US$0.1 million to prepare specifications and detailed plans for
rehabilitation work. Training cost of US$0.30 million would be incurred based on the anna
traiing program approved by IDA.
Health (US$2.1 million). The project would fund rehabilitation of building, equipment, vehicles
and spares, drugs and medical supplies, vector control and non-pharmaceutical supplies.
Equipment, vehicles and spares (US$0.7 million) and drugs and medical supplies (US$0.4
million) would be procured by the PMU using ICB procedures and supplied to the districts. A
limited number of single items of equipment (US$0.1 million) and reagents (US$0.05 million)
would be procured by LCB. Rehabilitation of buildings would consist of a number of small and
scattered contra  not suitable for ICB and would be let under LCB (US$0.55 million). On-the-
job training of community groups would also be supportd.



32
Project Mnageent (US$0.83 million). The PMU would be the principal implementing body.
The PMU Secretariat team would consist of a project coordinator, deputy project coordinator,
procurement manager, financial manager, technical advisor and a team of supporting staff. The
PMU would implement various components of the project through the district coordinators
stationed in the four districts. The PMU Secretariat would be responsible for procurement,
financial management and supply and stores management of the project, as well as preparation of
various documents and seeking approvals through the Government and the Bank. Provision has
been made for appropriate office space for the PMU and for office equipment and supplies. A
radio communication network is also planned to improve communication between the districts and
the PMU. A fax machine would be provided to accelerate communication with international
suppliers. Tbe technical advisor would be an international expert, engaged either on secondment
from another international agency or appointed under World Bank Guidelines on Use of
Consultants. The other four senior staff of the PMU would be recruited through advertisement
and would be remunerated on a special pay package applicable to 'Officer Consultant". The
selection of the technical advisor and senior staff would be done in consultation with IDA.
Training (US$035 mifion). Inmediately after the Credit is signed, the PMU would prepare an
annual program for training activities for each project component, to be cleared with IDA, which
would include the nature of training, estimated cost, personnel and place and period of training.
Review by the Bank. All ICB contracts and contracts for good and works estimated at
US$100,000 on more would be subject to IDA's prior review procedures. This would cover 85
percent of the contracts under prior review category. Contracts below the above threshold would
be reviewed on selective basis 1 in 5. All consultant contracts above US$100,000 would be
subject to prior review of IDA. Ihe PMU would monitor procurement and maintain records of
al procurement activities. Contract for selective reviews would be kept with the PMU.
91. Tedchinal Assistance The proposed project provides for technical assistance, primarily
short term, of about 7 staff-years of expatriate services and 3 staff-years of local staff. Thirty-six
staff-years of contract local personnel would also be hired. All specialists/consulting firms would
be hired under contracts on terms and conditions acceptable to IDA and in accordance with the
Bank Group's Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and the World
Bank as Executing Agency (August 1981).
92;   Disbursements. Disbursements would be on the basis of 100 percent of total eligible
expenditures. All disbursements would be requested in accordance with Bank guidelines and
operate under procedures acceptable to IDA. Disbursements would be fully documented except
for paymens for contracts less than US$100,000 equivalent, which would be disbursed on the
basis of statement of expenditure (SOEs). SOEs would be certified by the finance manager in
the PMU Secreiat and the ERD, who would confirm ta these are in agreement with the boolk
of account. Supporting documentation would be retained and made available for review by the
auditors and IDA supervision missions. An indicative schedule of disbursements is shown in
Schedule B. Expenditures for agricultural inputs up to an amount of US$500,000 may be
disbursed retroactively against expenditures made since December 1, 1992. Expenditures
financed retroactively must also conform to Bank procurement guidelines.
93.    Special Account, As set out under the payment mechanism (para. 86) a separate SDA
would be established with an initial deposit of US$2.5 million. Payments to overseas suppliers
and reimbursement of local payments would be made from this account. The SDA would be
replenished at least on a monthly basis and on the basis of doeumentary evidence to be provided



33
to IDA by Government. Withdrawal applications above US$250,000 equivalent would be
submitted to IDA for direct payment.
94.    Accounts and Audit. As set out in the payment mechanism (paras. 85-88) books of
account for the PMU and the districts would be maintained in accordance with sound and
generally recognized accounting principles and practices satisfactory to IDA. The accounts would
record expenditures under the different components of the program and also record the source of
funding. An annual audit would be carried out by the Controller and Auditor General or
independent auditors acceptable to IDA and audit reports would be submitted within six months
after the end of each Government fiscal year. The audit reports would include a detailed
statement of the adequacy of the accounting system and internal controls, an independent opinion
on the reliability of statements of expenditure as a basis for disbursements and an independent
opinion on the operations of the SDA.
95.    Reporting and Evaluation. Quarterly progress reports, in a format to be agreed, on the
performance of the project components would be prepared and submitted to IDA by the PMU.
Contract awards, disbursement documents, quarterly reports, audited statements of account and
IDA supervision reports would form the basis for monitoring project performance. A project
completion report prepared by the PMU Secretariat and endorsed by the SRT would be prepared
and submitted to IDA within six months of the completion of the project.
96.    Mid Tewm Review. The progress and impact of the program interventions would be
jointly reviewed by the OP and IDA, not later than January 31, 1994. To facilitate this review,
the PMU Secretariat, assisted by consultants, would prepare a mid-term report on the
implementation of the project by December 31, 1993. The review would evaluate: (i) the
performance of the agricultural inputs distribution for the 1993 planting season, including details
of quantities delivered by district, and its impact on the agricultural production of those districts;
(ii) details of the performance of the anima health vaccination program and an evaluation of its
impact; (iii) progress of the drought management and environment components, together with
recommendations for possible design changes and/or financial reallocations of the sub-
componens; (iv) progress on the water component as measured against the action plan, together
with recommendations for any alterations to the action plan for the second stage of program
implementation; (v) progress on the health component as measured against the action plan,
together with recommendations for any alterations to the action plan for the second stage of
program implementation; (vi) progress on the roads rehabilitation component, including details of
the three roads contracts, status of procurement of spares and equipment, provision for future
maintenance of project-funded roads, and the status of the studies; (vii) a review of the central
and district organizational structures; (viii) a financial report on payments and commitments under
the program and an evaluation of the payment mechanism; and (ix) a overall assessment of the
status of the recovery process in the ASAL areas. This review would form the basis for
Government/IDA to assess what corrective action may need to be taken and whether any
reallocation between non performing and performing components is required. Assurances on this
were obtained at negotiations (para. 99).
97.    Environment hnpact. Two years of drought have already created an adverse
environmental stress on the fragile ASAL areas. This has been exacerbated by an influx of
refugees into the arid lands with adverse effect on the water facilities and rangelands. Any short
term intervention cannot possibly address the complexities of sound enviromental management of
these areas. However, the design of the DRP and the IDA-supported program seeks to
incorporate mitigatory actions witiin the various components being funded. The teams preparing



34
the longer term ASAL development project are in the process of developing district environmental
action plans and others have produced a range management handbook for a number of arid
districts which provides detailed mapping and data on water and range resources. These and
other reports have formed the basis for the small environxment component to support rangeland
management and other environmental interventions (paras. 54-61). The water action plan also
ses out details of proposed interventions to ensure that due attention is given to appropriate
rehabilitation and upgrading and construction of more environmentally sound and more easily
maintained water facilities such as shallow wells and roof catchments.
98.    The project does not call for the construction of prime new roads and no major
realignment would be necessary. However, new gravel pits would have to be established, and
where the eroded condition of the existing roads call for diversion, mitigatory actions will be
taken to prevent fiuther erosion in the abandoned portions, to restore the site in the long run. In
collaboration with the water resources component, the gravel pits would be restored to water-pans
or reservoirs. Where road sections have to be raised, the sides would be planted with grass to
prevent erosion. Adequate side-ditches and run-offs would be constructed with scour-checks
where necessary. Provision for drainage structures has also been made to restore natural water
courses.
C. AGREEENS 1REACHED AT NEGOTAUTIONS
99.    Agreement on the following was reached during negotiations: (i) the action plan for the
water component (para. 70); (ii) the action plan for the health component (para. 76); and (iii) the
items to be addressed and the completion of a mid-term report by December 31, 1993 and its
review by Government and IDA by January 31, 1994 (para. 96). Distribution of seeds and
appointment of the key members of the PMU Secretariat (project coordinator, technical advisor,
procurement officer and finance officer) would be conditions of Credit effectiveness (paras. 45
and 82).
