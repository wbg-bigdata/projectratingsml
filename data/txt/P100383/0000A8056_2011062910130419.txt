                         The revised PDO is to contribute to (i) the rehabilitation and clean up of unauthorized waste disposal sites and creeks and (ii) the strengthening of the capacity
                         of the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality (IMM) to mitigate the impact of earthquakes by retrofitting infrastructure and providing training to respond to
                         emergencies more effectively.

                         Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality (IMM) has signed 14 contracts to initiate rehabilitation works in 9 high priority creeks in Istanbul. Actual works have commenced in only 6 contracts
                         and payments have started. The remainder have faced delays due to design changes or consent or approval of stake holders. Procurement is underway for Microzonation studies in

                         project is not in compliance with its Project Legal Agreement and the procedures and policies with which it is legally required to comply. The management of IMM has been notified of
                         this and has confirmed that it intends to bring the project back into compliance. However, as of the date of this ISR, progress has been slow and incomplete. Given the continuing
                         low rate of disbursements, the lack of progress on several key components and activities that have not yet started and the slow resolution of project violations, the project's progress
                         towards meeting its development objectives and the targets of the project indicators remains very limited. As a result, the project rating remains unsatisfactory.
