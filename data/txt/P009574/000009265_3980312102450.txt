Block 1: Project Description
1. Project development objectives (see Annex 1 for key performance indicators).
The project will assist the Royal Government of Bhutan (RGOB) to build and strengthen physical and institutional capacity to
provide a higher quality basic education to more children, particularly from rural areas where access to higher grades in particular is
highly constrained. The specific objectives are:
(i) To increase the number of graduates from basic education and provide sufficient entrants to existing training programs to fill
labor demands.
(ii) To raise levels of learning in basic education through improved teacher trairing and teaching-learning activities.
(iii) To strengthen the quality of management within the education sector in support of the Government's ongoing decentralization
program.
Progress towards the achievement of these objectives will be monitored and assessed on the basis of the key indicators described in
Annex 1.
.................................................................................................................................................. .................... .................... ............. ....................... ...........................
2. Project components (see Annex 2 for a detailed description and Annex 3 for a detailed cost breakdown).
The project will have four components:
(a) Increasing and upgrading facilities for basic education, by constructing new schools and substantially upgrading existing
schools, and supporting decentralized construction.
(b) Expanding and improving teacher education, by (i) developing additional pirograms for teacher training; (ii) enhancing teacher
quality through curriculum review and further development of teaching skills; and (iii) supporting central, Dzongkhag (district) and
school-based in-service teacher training programs.
(c) Improving teaching and learning processes throughout basic education, by (i) curriculum review; (ii) developing continuous
evaluation and self-evaluation of learning processes; (iii) revising existing examinations and introducing standardized tests;
(iv) developing resource centers and school networks and; (v) developing an improved supplementary reading program.
(d) Strengthening the management and administration of basic education, by (i) farther strengthening the professional skills of
central staff and developing the capacity to introduce a decentralized school monitoring and supervisory system; (ii) strengthening
Dzongkhag educational administration; and (iii) strengthening school level management through networks and headteacher
training.

3. Benefits and Target Population:
The project will support the goals of RGOB's 8th Five-Year Plan and will spearhead the drive for full access to basic education
through increased student capacity and teacher output. The project will substantially improve the physical infrastructure available
to basic education through constructing and/or substantially upgrading 12 schools grades PP-VIII, providing a total of 8,300 places
(4,947 additional) including 2072 boarding places at grades VII and VIII. These boarding places will particularly benefit children
in the poorest and rural regions, who otherwise would be denied full access to schooling. The project will also provide considerable
benefits towards institutional and qualitative improvement of the basic education system, through professional development, in-
service training, curriculum enhancement, continuous assessment, exams and standardized testing, school guidance and support and
management strengthening at the central, district and school levels. It is expected that the expansion of the teacher training
capacity will increase the output of teacher trainees by 60 per annum by project completion.

level. Additional construction supervisory staff will be recruited to ensure adequate supervision of construction which represents
the major element of the IDA financed components. Full details of project implementation staffing, administrative structures within
DOE, and implementation loops for all main procedures are included in section 4 of the RGOB's Project Implementation Plan.
Accounting, financial reporting and auditing arrangements: These will fall under the purview of the project coordination unit in
DOE. Staffing and administrative arrangements for accounting, auditing and financial planning that worked well under Credit
1899-BHU will be adapted to reflect the current IDA guidelines for financial controls and reporting requirements. In keeping with
the intent to fully integrate this project within the administrative structure of the Ministry of Health and Education (MOHE), a full-
time qualified accountant and assistant will be located within the Financing and Accounting Section of the MOHE, with
responsibility for verification of proposed expenditures, and maintenance of financial records for the project. Project accounts will
again be computerized which will allow timely, reliable quarterly financial management reporting using tabular formats acceptable
to IDA.
Satisfactory arrangements are in place for receiving and disbursing donor funds. In view of the decentralized nature of the
implementation of the construction program and expenditure that will take place at the Dzongkhag (District) level, the MOF have
proposed a ledger account for each district, to be maintained separately from the main district account in order to permit faster
retrieval of data for expenditure certification, disbursements, and financial reporting. The proposed auditor (the Royal Audit
Authority of Bhutan) is acceptable to IDA. Annual financial statements will be prepared in accordance with formats to be agreed
with IDA. Fund flow, budget preparation, and project management loops are illustrated in the Borrower's PIP. During
negotiations, RGOB confirmed that it will provide quarterly FMR's and audited project financial statements with the audit report
within six months of the end of the FY in formats acceptable to IDA, and that these formats will be included in the PIP for the
project.
Monitoring and evaluation arrangements: The responsibility for monitoring and evaluation will be held by the Interministerial
Taskforce which will be maintained through the life of the project.

Block 2: Project Rationale
5. CAS objective(s) supported by the
project:
The proposed project is consistent with the current Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) paper, discussed by the Board on July 6, 1993
as part of the Third Forestry Development Project (No. 25330), and with the proposed CAS to be discussed by the Board in October
1998. Given the limited absorptive capacity and the small number of beneficiaries for any given project, the Bank and Government
agree that for most sectors other donors are likely to have a comparative advantage. IDA's approach is to provide limited but
strategic assistance in support of the Government's commitment to human resotirce development and preservation of the country's
unique ecological and cultural heritage. In particular, the intention is to concentrate IDA resources on economic policy advice,
natural resources management and basic education. The proposed project strengthens and improves the quality of primary education
(to grade VI) in several ways and also responds to the Govermnent's intention to expand basic education to grades VII and VIII,
consistent with the 8th Plan 1997-2002 objectives for education.
.........     ............    ................................................ ...........I........................................................................ ...........I............................................... ......................................
6. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
Modern education started in Bhutan in 1961. Since then RGOB has shown a strong commitment and has invested heavily in the
sector. Primary enrollment has grown at an impressive rate, including an 8 percent annual expansion rate over the past five years,
with the gross enrollment ratio currently reaching 72 percent. The Government anticipates that universal primary education will be
achieved by the end of the 9th Plan in 2007. The main sectoral issues facing the Government are:
(a) Constrained access to post-primary schooling. The rapid growth in primary school enrollment is resulting in greatly increased
social demand for secondary schooling for which the gross enrollment ratio is currently around 12 percent. The Government is
planning to address this through a substantial increase in capacity for junior secondary (grades VII and VIII) in the next two plan
periods combined with a decrease in the transition rate from grade VIII to grade IX.
(b) Shortage of Bhutanese teachers. The percentage of Bhutanese teachers in primary and secondary schools in 1996 was 83 and 61
percent, respectively. The projected expansion of school enrollments and the supply of trained teachers imply that while the primary
school teaching force will be effectively Bhutanized by 2005, the proportion of Bhutanese teachers in secondary schools could
decrease to 48 percent of those required.  In addition to the pedagogical effects of this, the gradual fall in real teacher salaries has
resulted in increased difficulty in external recruitment of teachers, mostly from India. This indicates a need for training capacity to
gradually switch from primary to secondary over the next 5-10 years.
(c) Improving learning achievements. The RGOB has proven its commitment to providing a high quality education by relatively
high investment in programs aimed at, for example, curriculum renewal, greater teacher effectiveness and training materials
preparation. It is Government strategy to consolidate and strengthen this focus.
(d) Increasing financial burden of education. High rates of growth of primary school intakes over the past years have fueled the
growth of education expenditures. However, this has been anticipated by Government, which has allocated a higher than average
growth rate of recurrent expenditure for the 8th Plan period. In addition, to conserve resources, free stationary has been withdrawn
from urban schools and the proportion of government-funded boarding places reduced. Multi-grade teaching practices have been
extended and increasingly the responsibility for primary school construction and maintenance is being transferred to local
communities.
(e) Decentralizing management policv. The RGOB is committed to substantial administrative decentralization, including for
education and civil works. However, management and implementation capacity for the anticipated level of decentralization at district
level is as yet underdeveloped.

7. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
Each of the above sector issues is addressed by the project in the following way:
(a) Improving access by: constructing three new schools providing classes PP: to VIII and expanding and rehabilitating nine
primary schools to incorporate grades VII and VIII to result in a net additional 4947 places, including 2072 places for boarding
students, enabling continued schooling for children, who live beyond a reasonable walking distance to school, in this mountainous
country.

Country: Bhutan                                                                               Project Title: Second Education Project
(b) Reducing teacher shortage by: developing programs to increase the output of teachers for grades VII and VIII by 60 a year by the
end of the project.
(c) Improving learning by: curriculum improvement in teacher training institutions; further development of central, Dzongkhag
and school-based in-service teacher training; curriculum review and adjustment for grades IV to VIII; improved assessment and
examination procedures; the creation of resource centers; and development of a supplementary reading program.
(d) Increasing cost effectiveness by: improving teaching quality and reducing repetition and dropout rates; piloting alternative
building technologies and designs; shifting the financial burden of primary school construction to the community and limiting
boarding facilities provision.
(e)  Supporting effective decentralization by: increasing the capacity for the management and coordination of a decentralized
monitoring, supervision and inspection system; strengthening the Dzongkhag administration and school construction capacity;
improving the professional and managerial competence of headteachers.
The main strategic choices in the development of the proposed project are first, the relative emphases placed on expanding school
places and improving the quality of schooling and, second, the relative focus on the primary and junior secondary components of
basic education. In spite of the anticipated high increase in enrollments and classroom space, the RGOB has been consistent in its
desire to ensure that previous investments in quality enhancement will be maintained and strengthened. These include both
pedagogic inputs and the facilities to provide a well rounded education. Inclusive of contingencies, of the total project cost, 55
percent is devoted to civil works, 10 percent to the cost of furniture, equipment and construction management and 35 percent to
components which aim to improve the quality of teaching and learning. The quality enhancement components are focused across all
eight grades of basic education. The civil works program concentrates more on providing additional places for grades VII and VIII.
In all, an additional 809 places for grades PP-VI and 4138 for grades VII and VIII will be built under the project. While enrollment
to the primary grades (PP-VI) is not yet universal, the recent decision to allow community schools to extend their range from grade
III to grade VI, an anticipated grant of Nu 366 million from the Indian Government over the 8 Plan period for school rehabilitation,
the impending graduation of large numbers of grade VI pupils in coming years and the necessity of providing some boarding places
for rural children have together influenced the provision of civil works under the project towards the higher grades of basic
education.
A key aspect of educational decentralization discussed during appraisal was the need to modify the role of the inspectorate to enable
it to focus on school support and teacher professionalism and to link this proposed change to development of the planned resource
center component of the project. It is envisaged that Bhutan will eventually have a network of 55 resource centers, providing a high
level of outreach and support to schools. The project would help Bhutan engineer this change through a total of 20 resource centers
to be developed in two phases, starting with a two-year pilot phase in which 6 resource centers would be established. The PIP
includes details of actions planned by RGOB to introduce these changes. During negotiations RGOB provided an assurance that by
August 30, 2000 or prior to extending the component to the non-pilot districts, it will submit an evaluation of the outcome of this
pilot phase to IDA for review and comment.
............................................................................................................................................................................. ..............................................................................
8. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:
During preparation of the project, the RGOB actively sought an optimum structure of the project in several extended workshops
attended by national and local administrators and educators. The outcomes, in turn, have been fully discussed with the IDA/Swiss
Development Cooperation (SDC) missions including in national workshops and with an interministerial task force established for
the project. Among the alternatives considered and rejected were:
(a) A civil works focus only on the lower grades of basic education was rejected for the reasons specified in para. 7 above.
(b) An emphasis on vocational training both inside and outside of schools was initially proposed but eventually withdrawn. The
issue of developing demand-driven models of vocational-technical training was considered urgent but requires an initial in-depth
evaluation of available options and a likely considerable investment. A proposed National Technical Training Authority is expected
to be created by RGOB to review the issues. It was eventually decided to include only the limited extra-curricular maintenance skills
in project schools and to focus the new project on the core of basic education, building upon positive experience of the first education
project.

(c) Acceptance of a projected significantly increased share of foreign teachers ir. the total cadre of secondary teachers was eventually
rejected on the grounds that recruitment is becoming increasingly more difficult and that the orientation of teacher training at both
primary and secondary levels in Bhutan and in neighboring countries is increasingly dissimilar in important respects.
(d) Retaining the central government capacity in the form of the Schools Planning and Building Cell (SPBC) for the comprehensive
management and supervision of the project's substantial civil works program was considered but rejected on the grounds of the
RGOB's policy objective to substantially decentralize administrative authority to the Dzongkhag (district) level. To strengthen the
capacity of the Dzongkhags to manage the program, the project includes contract bidding and contractor selection under SPBC
purview, with construction technicians recruited to strengthen contract supervision at the local level. However, the building program
will continue to rely upon the SPBC for monitoring of quality, training, technical assistance and backstopping.
(e) A project financed by a larger number of donors was considered but rejected by RGOB. The Government views IDA and SDC as
the lead donors in the sector with an effective working relationship demonstrated during the previous project and continued
throughout the preparation of the proposed project. Each agency is perceived to bring specific value-added to the Government's
project preparation process.

10. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design:
The design of the proposed project has incorporated lessons learned from:
(i) Operations Evaluation Department's evaluations of Bank projects.
These evaluations stress the importance of building national commitment to quality and evaluation, ensuring borrower ownership
and limiting excessive donor involvement, coordinating closely with other donors to avoid conflicting advice, focusing on
strengthening institutional capacity to provide quality and sustainability, and incorporating careful monitoring and evaluation
into project design.
The project design has incorporated all of these lessons. During preparation, the Government's inter-ministerial team moved
decisively towards increasing the size of quality improvement components and this strong taskforce has ensured total borrower
ownership. The donors have assisted in project design only during missions and have not dominated the process. The two donors
have held joint missions at all times and cooperated closely in all respects and, as a result, conflicting advice has been absent. The
strong emphasis on human resource development in the project and the Government's own emphasis on quality will help to ensure
the sustainability of project activities.
(ii) The recently completed Primary Education Project.
A realistic assessment of the geographical, contractor and labor market constraints facing a school building program.
Careful consideration of the supervisory staffing needs and contract award procedures for civil works.
A major emphasis on identifying high quality overseas training and an avoidance of courses offering packages of lower quality.
Problems of new schools siting.
The major lessons learned from the completed project relate to the civil works components. Problems associated with site selection
delayed project implementation. In the proposed project, only three new schools will be built and these will be commenced in a
second tranche after work on existing schools has commenced. However, sites for these schools have already been confirmed.
Problems associated with a fledgling construction industry with lengthy supply lines for materials and the extensive use of foreign
contracted labor have been identified and appropriate responses built into the project. Over the ten year period of the recent project,
the Bhutanese have developed a good understanding of what they require from external training courses and are inclined to use
predominantly high quality training.

11. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership:
The RGOB is very committed to providing a high quality and well-rounded basic education to all children. An indication of this
commitment is that the recurrent cost guidelines for the 8th Plan period held all ministries and divisions, apart from health and
education, to a maintenance of current real levels of expenditures while these two divisions were allowed a 3 percent a year real
growth. At the initial stages of project preparation, Government intimated that some coverage of the recurrent costs (for incremental
teacher salaries) would be requested from donors. This was later withdrawn, and the total cost of incremental salaries plus half the
cost of project operations will be funded by Government.
The project will assist RGOB to implement a significant part of the 8th Plan proposals, which were developed through a bottom-up
approach through consultations between district administrations and communities.
The Inter-ministerial Task Force established for the purpose of project preparation has been very effective, particularly through the
development of a detailed education financing model and dedicated project design workshops, in analyzing the current situation and
trends, laying out alternative approaches to perceived problems and constraints and documenting the implications of particular
policy choices.
During project preparation, the RGOB sent two officers to Washington to train on project costing and a team to Colombia to
participate in an EDI program on multigrade teaching.
The Project Implementation Plan has been developed in consultation with IDA and SDC.
The performance indicators developed by Government following a mission workshop have been fully prepared.
Demonstrated willingness during project preparation to make trade-offs between capital works on the one side and increased
investments in training and a general strengthening of educational quality on the other.
....... ........... ............................................................................. .............................................................................................................................................................
12. Value added of Bank support:
The RGOB has identified IDA and SDC as the central donors with which it pursues policy discussions in the education sector and
appreciates that dialogue. A good working relationship between IDA and SDC has been developed over the past ten years. The IDA
team has been instrumental in the promotion of a computerized model of the education system which has allowed the Bhutanese
team to make detailed simulations of enrollment flows, teacher supply and demand, capital works, unit recurrent costs and overall
financial needs (see para. 13). The IDA team has also been responsible for helping Government develop its approach to the
implications of decentralization and the steps needed to maintain the current level of school building efficiency, future constraints on
teacher supply, examinations and assessments and demand-driven vocational training.

Fiscal impact (for all projects):
(See Annex 4)
Public and privatefinancing and provision of basic education:
Public financing of basic education in Bhutan is justified on both equity and efficiency grounds. Out of total school enrollments of
90,378, those in private school are 1,424 and over seventy percent of these are in Thimphu. Annual fees in private primary schools
are between Nu. 5,000 - 6,000 which is equivalent to almost half of the official estimate of per capita income. Private schooling can
be afforded by very few. The social benefits of basic schooling in Bhutan are likely to be high. To the extent that they are beyond the
benefits which influence parents' investment in the education of their children, limiting educational provision to that which is
privately financed would result in social benefits being below the socially optimal level. In Bhutan, the difference is likely to be
significant.
In principle, public financing of education need not necessitate public provision. The private education sector could be subsidized.
However, the very small size of the existing private sector and its geographical restriction to just two urban settlements strongly
suggests that the opportunity to expand the sector does not exist in at least the short and medium term. Fees in existing private

schools are over twice the unit recurrent costs in government schools.
Parents increasingly pay for their children's' schooling in government schools. Through the costs of 'private' boarding and the
provision of labor for school buildings and teachers' houses (by rural families), and the provision of learning materials (by urban
families) the financing of basic education is shared between parents, communities and the Government.
Project alternatives:
During project preparation some of the implications of alternative scenarios including with and without project and different project
compositions were considered. The alternative scenarios included a civil works focus only on the lowest grades of schooling, a strong
emphasis on vocational training in schools and an acceptance of a significant increase in the number and share of foreign teachers in
the teaching force. Among the implications investigated were the effects on the transition rate from class VI to VII and on teacher
pupil ratios, and a rough estimate of the increased level of labor productivity which would have been required to provide an economic
justification for a significant vocational training component. The increase is well beyond that implied by actual earnings differentials
(Annex 4).
Project benefits:
The project has two major components. The first will provide additional places for primary grades PP-VI and also for grades VII and
VIII which complete the basic education cycle. While the specific evidence does not exist, there is no reason to believe that in
Bhutan, the direct economic returns to primary schooling and literacy or the impact on fertility, child morbidity and mortality and
nutritional status of the family will be significantly below those recorded elsewhere To these benefits can be added the importance of
the impact of a common primary schooling on the consolidation of national identity. Expansion of places in 'upper primary' grades
VII and VIII requires further consideration.
Currently, class VIII leavers find little difficulty finding training courses or employment. In recent years the concern has been more
that the available places in trades training courses and in teacher training have not been filled. However, in a small labor market such
as exists in Bhutan, shortages can soon turn into surpluses. As part of the enrollments and education finance model (described
below), data on places in training courses have been gathered and compared to the graduates of the formal education system. The
estimates are conservative and several other opportunities are likely to exist. In 1997, 3387 students will graduate from class VIII
and at least 3050 places are estimated to be available for them in further schooling or in full time training courses. Similarly, 1,450
students will graduate from class X and training places exist for at least 1,050. A general consensus is that employment is available
for the rest. By the end of the 8th Plan in 2002, graduates of class VIII will increase to 6,500 and of class X to 3,255. With a constant
level of training places, 1,050 and 2,100 graduates of classes VIII and X respectively will require direct employment. If places in
training courses were to increase at the anticipated rate of growth of the economy, all class VIII graduates would be absorbed while
around 1700 class X graduates would require employment. Many jobs, currently, are filled by non-nationals. In absolute numbers
these positions, plus those which will be generated over the next six to eight years in hydro power construction and related services,
would appear to offer sufficient employment opportunities for school leavers. At issue, however, will be the skill mix and the length
of time that it will take in Bhutan (as elsewhere) for employment expectations to merge with opportunities.
As part of project preparations, a tracer study of a significant proportion of 1995/96 class VIII and X leavers was undertaken through
questionnaires to schools and follow-up visits as a first stage in establishing a permanent monitoring system. The response rate was
very high compared to the typical survey of this type. The work and further education/training experiences of 1790 and 770 class VIII
and class X leavers respectively, 9 -12 months following graduation were sampled. Ninety percent of class VIII leavers are known to
be still within the education/training system. Of the remaining ten percent, most are likely to be back in their village. Of the class X
leavers, eighty seven percent remain within the system and a maximum of thirteen percent have entered the labor market. So far, the
youthfulness of the education/training system and the small number of students involved (in 1996 enrollments in class VIII and X
were 3678 and 1395 respectively) allows the vast majority of class VIII and X leavers to delay their entry to the labor market until
they have completed tertiary education/training. The high rates of growth of enrollments in basic education over the past few years
suggest that the situation may change rapidly. This, and the small size of the wage labor market, implies that tracer exercises such as
the one reported above needs to become institutionalized. This is under consideration.
The second main component of the project aims to raise the quality of schooling across grades pre-primary to VIII. Since around
75,000 of the 84,500 enrollments are in the primary grades, PP - VI, most of the benefits of the interventions will accrue to this
group. The impact on learning will be measured through the standardized tests being prepared as part of the project. The economic
impact will be felt through increases in the system's internal efficiency as described below and through productivity gains from grade
VIII leavers who directly enter employment and eventually from graduates of higher grades as they graduate and enter the labor
force. Higher quality schooling tends to lead to lower dropout and repetition rates resulting in a much lower unit cost of schooling per



Project Appraisal Document                                                                                     Page 9
Country: Bhutan                                                                        Project Title: Second Education Project
graduate. Potentially the financial gains from such increases in internal efficiency are large. In Bhutan, over grades I - VI, annual
repetition rates average 15 percent and dropout rates 4 percent. Applying the conventional student flow model, these rates imply that
on average, over 11 student years of instruction are required to ensure one grade VI graduate - or 60 percent more than would be
necessary if both dropout and repetition levels were zero. While this does not translate proportionately into potential savings in
financial resources, it is clear that the current levels of internal inefficiency are resulting in higher costs and larger class sizes.
School quality is not the only determinant of repetition and dropout. However, the potential gains from higher quality basic schooling
as a result of the project are significant, leading to lower dropout and repetition rates and greater efficiency.
Poverty reduction andproject targeting:
The official estimate of per capita income for 1995 is US$450.  No studies of income distribution exist. The project, through
expanding the coverage of basic schooling and increasing its quality, will in general increase the potential of young people to be more
productive than otherwise, resulting in higher incomes and a greater recognition of the opportunities to improve their own lives and
those eventually of their families. More particularly, the project will enable more children from relatively remote areas to continue
their schooling beyond the level they would otherwise reach by increasing boarding places in classes VII and VIII by over 2000. It is
generally the case that geographically remote households are the poorest.
System Modeling:
In a country such as Bhutan with a small population, even a relatively small expansion of one level of education can have significant
effects in the near future on the system's overall enrollments, teacher requirements and recurrent costs. Consequently, a major effort
during the period of project preparation has been to increase significantly the capacity within the Government to model enrollment,
financial and other flows within the education system. The model developed goes beyond financial projections of the system and their
relation to forecasts of government expenditure and includes both a teacher demand and supply model (including the need for
expatriates) and assessments of the available schooling/training opportunities for graduates from each level of the system and
required employment opportunities. The model (with continuous modification and expansion) is now completely incorporated within
the Division of Education's management structure and has been used extensively at each stage of project preparation and for the
preparation of the Five Year Plan 1997-2002.
Fiscal impact:
The education sector absorbs around 14 percent of total Government recurrent expenditures and 24 percent of recurrent development
expenditures. It is the highest spending sector. Funding for the proposed project will be the largest source of additional resources for
the expansion and improved quality of the sector over the next five years and will eventua;ly have financial repercussions throughout
the sector. Economic growth during the 7th Plan period averaged 5.8 percent a year. Over the 8th Plan period (1997-2002), this is
forecast to increase to 6.5 percent. Government revenues are anticipated to increase by 7.2 percent a year and the overall average
fiscal deficit to be equal to one percent of GDP. The Bank's 1996 CEM notes that Bhutan pursues prudent fiscal policies and
achieved a fiscal surplus in 1995/96, and projects a GDP annual growth rate of over 6 percent over the next five years. The report,
however, suggests that the fiscal projections in the 8th Plan are optimistic in both the anticipation of donor finance for recurrent
expenditures (mainly grants from India) and the underlying growth of expenditures and planned expansion particularly of health and
education. While the report accepts that progress has been made in establishing a realistic framework for forecasting recurrent
expenditures in education, it notes that similar progress has not been made in the health sector.
The Guidelines for the preparation of the 8th Plan stipulated that, apart from the requirements of a general salary increase, recurrent
allocations would remain constant in real terms apart from in education and in health where a 3 percent annual increase would be
allowed in each case. The final Plan document projects total expenditures 45 percent above those in the 7th plan period with
education expenditures 65 percent higher. Between 1997/98 and 2001/2 nominal expenditures on education are projected to increase
by 8 percent a year (apart from the general salary increase). Accounting for inflation on goods and services and salary increments,
there is an allowance for around 4 percent a year in real expenditures. The enrollment and system objectives adopted by the
Education Division are forecast to be roughly financially viable within the 8th Plan allocations though this may be somewhat
optimistic on two counts. First, primary school teachers will need to increase by around 45 percent and secondary teachers by almost
100 percent during the period. Overall, the teaching stock will need to increase by 9 percent a year. While the average salary of new
teachers will be below the average teacher salary, it is likely that there will be upward pressure on current allocations. However, both
the Planning and Finance Ministries have given assurances that all teachers graduating from the colleges will be employed. The
second reason is more important. The gross enrollment rate in primary school is around 72 percent. A key assumption of the
enrollment and financial projections is that enrollments into the pre-primary class will increase by an average of 5.5 percent a year.
Estimates of the birth and child mortality rates suggest a six year old age group increasing by 3.0 - 3.2 percent a year.  If the
projections are held to, the gross enrollment rate will be around 85 percent by the end of the 8th Plan which is well below the
Government's objectives. In practice, however, recent experience suggests that parental demand for enrollment growth in pre-

primary will be higher with a consequent pressure for increased financial resources.
Total projected recurrent allocations to the sector over the five year project period are Nu 2089 million. The project size is
US$21.18 million including a RGOB contribution of US$1.96 million or roughly -Nu 80 million (largely for teachers' salaries) which
is equal to 4 percent of planned recurrent expenditure. Cumulative Government incremental recurrent allocations to education over
the period are Nu 314 million. Project needs will be equal to almost one quarter of these. Since the project is the main single vehicle
for sector expansion during the period, the requirement for Government funds is capable of being met, provided the aggregate
revenue and expenditure patterns projected in the 8th Plan are realized.

14. Financial Assessment (see Annex 5)                   NPV=US$                million; FRR=          %
The total cost of the project is US$21.18 million of which US$13.69 million will be contributed by IDA, and the equivalent of
US$5.53 million by SDC and US$1.96 million by the RGOB. SDC's funds will be provided through a parallel bi-lateral grant
through Helvetas, a major Swiss NGO. Separate agreements will be reached between the RGOB and SDC and IDA to reflect
individual donor requirements. Both agencies regard the overall project as their joint development goal for the sector. The direct and
indirect foreign exchange cost is estimated at US$10.12 million. The project would fund the investment costs of civil works,
furniture, equipment, vehicles, books and small school libraries, teaching materials, consultant services, fellowships, training and
workshops. RGOB and SDC would jointly fund the recurrent costs of project operational expenses, maintenance of vehicles and
equipment purchased with project funds. Incremental salaries would be fully funded by the Government.
In all cost categories, estimates are based largely on the experience with procurement for similar activities recently completed under
the Primary Education Project (PEP). Estimated costs for civil works reflect standards followed in the PEP and the costs for furniture,
equipment, vehicles, books, teaching materials, fellowships and specialist consultant services are based on experiences in the same
project, and on UNDP rates.
Estimated project costs include physical contingencies of US$1.19 million equivalent estimated at 10% for civil works and physical
components, 5% for equipment and 10% for books and journals. The estimated costs also include price contingencies of US$1.33
million.
The yearly breakdown of the total project cost by investment and recurrent expenditures as well as the yearly financing sources as
percentages of total project costs are shown in Annex 5.
....     ............................... ...................   -- ............................................ .....................-.......................................................
15. Technical Assessment:
Preparation of the proposed project has drawn on the experiences of PEP and many of the Government's preparation team have been
associated with that project for several years. This, plus the combination of a broad consultative process and debate over the strategy
and components of the proposed project with comprehensive modeling exercises have resulted in a project carefully considered by
RGOB (the model is briefly described in para. 13 above and more comprehensively in Annex 4). From an initial proposal which
focused almost exclusively on civil works, the lengthy period of preparation resulted in a proposal which builds on past investments
and achievements in institutional development as well as providing for capacity expansion.
Two technical areas assessed in Bhutan during implementation of PEP and preparation of the proposed project are the design and
construction of civil works and the design of pedagogy or basic education. The civil works component will utilize designs based on
the considered experiences of the previous project and reflect a suitable approach in the geographical, climatic and habitational
context of Bhutan. Much attention has been given to teaching approaches and curriculum review for basic education in the past ten
years and a great deal has been achieved in developing a child-centered approach.

16. Institutional Assessment:
(a). Executing agencies: It is the intention of the RGOB to further decentralize a substantial amount of government administration to
the Dzongkhag's. In the initial stage of the project, an approach to the integration of central, Dzongkhag and school levels will be
developed and piloted in two Dzongkhags. The results will be reviewed and replicated as appropriate. One aspect of decentralization
is of particular interest. It is planned to decentralize the management of school co.nstruction contracts to the Dzongkhags. Given the
size of each individual school contract, the required speed of execution, the materials supply situation in the country and the
introduction of off-road schools into the program, it is very important that no additional obstacles are allowed. The RGOB plans to
give the DOE and the Dzongkhags joint responsibility to conduct the bidding and evaluation process and that the SPBC at the center
will have a monitoring and quality control function. The appraisal mission received confirmation on the respective roles of SPBC
and the Dzongkhags, plans for staffing and discussed tendering procedures to be followed to ensure selection of competent
contractors, the process for bid award and for supervision of construction. These steps are reflected in the RGOB PIP.

(b). Project management:  The proposed project will be significantly more complex than the PEP, have more components, be
implemented during the early stages of decentralization, have to be completed within a much shorter period and will need to account
for expenditures to two financing partners. Government intends that management of the project will be fully integrated within the
DOE.
During appraisal, the mission discussed with RGOB the plans for management of the various project components and the designation
of DOE and other RGOB sections and key staff that would be responsible. The PIP provides details of procedural loops and outlines
in detail activities to be undertaken during years I and 2 of the project together with designation of the section responsible
17. Social Assessment:
The National Education Policy envisages provision of education in settings which do not unnecessarily uproot children from their
cultural and home environment. It also places a strong emphasis on the traditional ties existing in society.
Gender disparities are lower in Bhutan than in several other countries of the region. Currently, 44 percent of primary school children
are girls - up from 39 percent in 1990, and parity is expected to be achieved without impediment. Both the relatively high share, and
the increase, result in part from the expansion of community schools which have reduced walking time to school. In secondary
schools the percentage of girls is also rising but slightly lower, at 37 percent. Distance to school is commonly cited as a reason. The
provision of boarding facilities in project schools for grades VII and VIII will further encourage girls' enrollment as will increased
numbers of women teachers.
A major problem confronting the education system is the rugged terrain and climate which results in limited communication links,
low density patterns of settlement, impeded access to schooling, and problems of facilities distribution. The project will continue to
support the boarding schools strategy to address this problem as well as provide support to the rapidly growing network of small
community schools which serve the largely rural population.
Child labor is reported by UNICEF not to be a problem in Bhutan. This aspect is regulated by RGOB and the legal employment age
is 18.
Bhutan has a mix of many languages and sub-cultures unified under a monarchy. However Bhutan experienced a period of civil
disturbances in 1989/90 in some of its southern districts, which led to the departure of several thousands of Bhutanese of Nepalese
origin. Some schools were destroyed and others closed. Over time the situation has stabilized with some schools reportedly relocated
to unaffected areas. Re-opening of schools has proceeded where possible. However it is acknowledged by RGOB that it has not been
possible to re-open 22 schools or about one fifth of those originally closed. People have also moved to other unaffected areas, and
while it is possible that some children may still not be able to attend schools because of closures, enrollments in southern districts
continue to grow at about the rate for the rest of the country. However, detailed comparison of southern Dzongkhags with other
districts is difficult as adequate census data are not available and changes in names of schools and in boundaries since 1991 further
complicate this task. The building of new schools and resource centers, and placements of teachers in southern Dzongkhags is
encouraging, and under the 8th Five Year Plan a further 25 schools are planned in these districts.
18. Environmental Assessment:         Environmental Category        Ii  A    []  B       [XI C
The proposed project would not raise any environmental issues and is classified under Category C. RGOB confirmed during
appraisal that no involuntary resettlement issues will arise from the construction of three new schools or the rehabilitation/expansion
of nine existing schools. This will be verified during supervision missions.
19. Participatory Approach:                        Identification/Preparation   Implementation         Operation

The project has developed from a process of participation started in 1994 and is closely linked to the development of the 8th Five
Year Plan (1997 - 2002). This involved a series of workshops, meetings and discussions between administrators, community leaders
and villages which identified and agreed on the basic needs of each Dzongkhag. This was followed by national meetings and
workshops at which center and district administrators, head teachers, teachers and the public participated.
(Information sharing - IS; Consultation - CON; Collaboration - COL Empowerment - EM)
20. Sustainability:
Technical / Institutional. One of the significant benefits of the first education project is the formation and development of the SPBC,
which has developed into a small but highly effective organization. This cell will be used during the project to strengthen the
construction management capabilities of the Dzongkhag administrations. Successful transmission of SPBC competencies through the
project to the Dzongkhags would facilitate the sustainability of the physical investments.

....... .... ........... ...... .................................................................................................................I,.............................. .........................I......................................................
During project preparation, the Interministerial Taskforce has developed the capacity to formulate policy and strategy. The project
will again develop programs to strengthen district administrations' management capacity and to formulate the framework for center-
district relationships. The project, following the Government's lead, places a relatively large emphasis on high quality training.
Fellowships provided by the SDC and through IDA support in past years have resulted in a small, stable, competent and highly
motivated team of professionals both in the central administration and in selected schools. For the sustainability of the proposed
project, such a team will need to continue to exist, and similar competencies built up in the Dzongkhag administrations.
Financial. Total recurrent expenditures on education in 1996/97 were Nu 275 million and are projected to rise to Nu 480 million by
2002 (in current prices). Incremental recurring expenditures in the final year of the project will be around Nu 40 million. 83 percent
of these will be salary costs, all of which will have been funded by the Government during the project. Overall, the increase in
required recurrent funding following project completion will be small. A more important issue is replicability. The explicit policy of
Government is for high quality buildings which require a minimum of maintenance and provide for a wide range of extra-curricular
activities. Added to these factors, unit costs of construction in Bhutan are high compared to most other countries as a result of
difficult terrain, an underdeveloped building industry, the emphasis by RGOB on high quality low maintenance facilities, and the
necessity to provide a large number of boarding places. The result is a relatively high capital cost per place. The project will provide
for around 4100 places for class VII and VIII students whereas the Department's projections imply the need for around 6000 places
during the 8th Plan period and a further 5000 over the 9th Plan. Part of the anticipated grant of Nu 366 million (US$ 10 million)
from the Government of India for the schooling sstem (including school refurbishment) is planned by RGOB for use in this area.

Annex 2
Bhutan: Second Education Project
Detailed Project Description
Project Component 1 - Increasing and upgrading facilities for basic education (USS12.2 million).
Increasing school places. The project will construct and equip three new schools providing classes PP-VIII and
substantially upgrade nine existing schools. A total of 4,947 additional places will be provided, including 4,138
at grades VII and VIII.
Project Component 2 - Teacher education (US$1.5 million).  This component includes three sub-
components:
Expanding training capacity. To address a shortage of Bhutanese teachers for upper Basic Education, steps will
be taken to increase the annual output of teachers for this level by 60 a year. These will include expanding
intakes at Samtse and Paro and further expansion of the Distance Education program..
Improving teaching quality in teacher training institutions. The training of teachers in the two existing teacher
training colleges will be improved through a program of short and long term fellowships and technical
assistance for further curriculum review and the development of improved approaches to the methodology and
practice of instruction.
Improving in-service teacher training. Following an evaluation and impact study of current practices, a master
plan for in-service training will be developed. Particular focus is likely on value education, evaluation and
continuous assessment and science/mathematics education for grades IV-VIII.  A program  of technical
assistance and study tours will support the development, evaluation and implementation of models of school-
based in-service programs focused on general teaching skills. Programs focusing on multigrade teaching
methodologies and practices will also be developed and implemented.
Project Component 3 - Improved teaching and learning processes (US$2.5 million). This component
includes five sub-components:
Refining curricula. The curricula for grades IV-VIII will be reviewed and redrafted to reflect the pedagogical
renewal process under the New Approach to Primary Education (NAPE), already adopted in grades PP-III.
Textbooks, other instructional materials and teacher guides will be correspondingly revised. Instructional
materials for multigrade teaching will be developed. Radio and audiovisual programs will be developed,
especially for use in resource centers and for schools in remote areas.
Developing assessment and examinations instruments. The first part of this component will develop, pilot and
implement procedures for student assessment and self-assessment following an analysis of the curriculum and
its disaggregation into learning objectives. The outcome will be the introduction of reliable and curriculum
related forms of continuous assessment relevant to the learning processes in grades IV to VI. The second part
will improve and extend the examination processes particularly for grades V and VIII and will develop
standardized testing instruments.
Providing and utilizing resource centers. Twenty simple resource centers consisting typically of a furnished
and equipped resource room in small schools will be established in two phases. The centers will have
equipment and materials to support the production of teaching-learning materials, offer working, learning and
communication opportunities to teachers, enhance multi-grade teaching and support school-based in-service
programs. In the initial phase covering six resource centers in three Dzongkhags, a conceptual framework and
guidelines for the effective functioning and utilization of the centers will be developed, with CAPSS playing the



Annex 2 (cont'd.)
Bhutan: Second Education Project
lead role. The experiences will be periodically assessed for the eventual further generalization of the model
throughout the country, estimated to require 55 centers.
Developing extra-curricular modes of vocational training. A small pilot program covering about 1,100 students
will be implemented to develop extra-curricular training of simple vocational skills to students of grades VII
and VIII through the creation of mobile training teams and the encouragement of vocational clubs. The initial
focus will be around school repair and maintenance programs. The activity will be closely monitored and be
reviewed in the third year of the project.
Improving and expanding the supplementary reading program. Sets of reference books for teachers and
students and supplementary reading materials will be provided to 102 community schools, 134 primary schools
and 24 junior high schools across all of the Dzongkhags in a two phased program. Phase 1 will focus on a small
number of schools to develop and test systems for acquiring and distributing the books. Teacher librarians will
also be trained. A task force will develop strategies for monitoring the utilization of school libraries and the
impact on reading habits. In phase 2, the program will be revised and extended to the full set of targeted
schools.
Project Component 4 - Strengthening educational management and administration (US$2.5 million). This
component has three sub-components.
Strengthening professional capacities at the central level. Long-term and short-term training and attachments
will be undertaken to strengthen professional development at the center, particularly in those fields important
for the implementation of the project. The major focus will be on plarning, personnel, inspection, civil works
and teaching methodology. A small program will be developed to promote the capacity to manage and
coordinate a decentralized system of school monitoring, supervision and auditing.
Developing institutional capacity in the Dzongkhags. Augmented by a program of training (fellowships) and
some equipment,  the institutional capacity of Dzongkhag educational administrations to manage a
decentralized schooling system will be developed. In addition to training, this will involve staffing plans,
professional profiles, reporting formats and new models of inspection. These will be developed and piloted
before replication across the country.
Improving school management. A program to strengthen the management capabilities of headteachers through
workshops and the development of materials will be implemented

Annex 4
Bhutan: Second Education Project
Economic Analysis
IDA strategy.
IDA's assistance strategy towards Bhutan is to provide limited but strategic support for human resource development and
preservation of the country's unique ecological and cultural heritage. Natural resource management and basic education, in
addition to economic policy advice, are the main areas of concentration. ThLe first IDA-supported project focused on the
provision of physical infra-structure for primary education and increased efficiency and quality of the education system. The
current project builds on several of the initial activities and aims to increase firther the efficiency and quality of the system
and help provide part of the additional school places required for universalizing basic education.
Public and private financing and provision of basic education.
Public financing of basic education in Bhutan is justified on both equity and efficiency grounds. Out of total school
enrollments of 90,378, those in private school are 1,424 and over seventy percent of these are in Thimphu. Annual fees in
private primary schools are between Nu. 5,000 - 6,000 which is equivalent to almost half of the official estimate of per capita
income. Private schooling can be afforded by very few. The social benefits of basic schooling in Bhutan are likely to be high.
In addition to the economic externalities which are captured by the non-schooled - as demonstrated strongly for instance in
agricultural communities in India, and the social benefits which are widely accepted to result from slower population growth
and a more healthy population, in Bhutan the all around development of the child is regarded as an important ingredient for
social cohesion and cultural identity. To the extent that these social benefits occur, but are beyond those which influence
parents' investment in the education of their children, limiting educational provision to that which is privately financed
would result in social benefits being below the socially optimal level. In Bhutan., the difference is likely to be significant.
In principle, public financing of education need not necessitate public provision. The private education sector could be
subsidized. However, the very small size of the existing private sector and its geographical restriction to just two urban
settlements strongly suggests that the opportunity to expand the sector does nct exist in at least the short and medium term.
Fees in existing private schools are over twice the unit recurrent costs in government schools.
Parents increasingly pay for their children's' schooling in government schools. Most important, around 60 percent of the full
cost of community school construction is provided by the communities through their labor. In the future, apart from in some
urban centers, all additional school places for the first seven years will be provided in these schools. Until the community
schools expand sufficiently to offer all classes to Primary VI, some children need to board. Government now provides
boarding only for classes VII and VIII. While the World Food Programme provides food for 'private boarders' all other costs
are borne by the parents. Out of around 62,500 children in community schools and primary schools, 10,296 are private
boarders. Finally, since 1994 the provision of free stationary (nine items) in urban schools has been removed. Through the
costs of boarding and learning materials, and the provision of labor for school buildings and teachers' houses, the financing
of basic education is shared between parents, communities and the Government.
Project alternatives.
The main schooling issues facing the Govemment are: (a) highly constrained access to post primary (class VI) schooling, (b)
a shortage of Bhutanese teachers and (c) the need to further improve system efficiency and schooling quality. The with and
without project comparison as well as alternative project compositions were considered and analyzed.
With and without project.   In the absence of the project component to expand school places, the percentage of class VI
leavers continuing to class VII would fall from a current 95 percent to a maximum of 75 percent. The group of children who
would be most negatively affected would be those from relatively remote comrmunities who would need to board in order to
take up a place. In the absence of plans to further expand the country's teacher training capacity for junior secondary
students (VII-VIII), either the student pupil ratios would increase and absolute shortages of, particularly, math and science
teachers arise or non-national teachers would have to increase from a current 48 percent of all secondary teachers to around
65 percent. In the absence of the project, many necessary activities leading to an increase in the quality (and enjoyment) of
schooling would not be in place. Higher quality schooling tends to lead to lower dropout and repetition rates, resulting in a
much lower unit cost of schooling per graduate. Potentially the financial gains from such increases in internal efficiency are
large. In Bhutan, over grades I - VI, annual repetition rates average 15 percent and dropout rates 4 percent. Applying the



Annex 4 (cont'd.)
Bhutan: Second Education Project
conventional student flow model, these rates imply that on average, over 11 student years of instruction are required to
ensure one grade VI graduate - or 60 percent more than would be necessary if both dropout and repetition levels were zero.
While this does not translate proportionately into potential savings in financial resources, it is clear that the current levels of
internal inefficiency are resulting in higher costs and larger class sizes. School quality is not the only determinant of
repetition and dropout. However, the potential gains from higher quality basic schooling, as a result of the project, leading to
lower dropout and repetition rates and greater efficiency are significant.
Alternative project compositions.    Three major alternative compositions of the project were considered.
A. A civil works focus only on the lower grades of schooling. This was eventually rejected for several reasons. While
enrollment in the primary grades (P-VI) is not yet universal, Government policy is to ensure that as far as is feasible the
required additional places will be provided within community schools which are built by the local population using roofing
materials and timber supplied by UNICEF and RGOB. The recent decision to allow these schools to extend their range from
class III to class VI further supported the decision. The rapid expansion of education in Bhutan requires considerable non-
Government involvement. In addition, an anticipated grant of US$ 10 million over the 8th Plan period from the Indian
Government is planned to be used mainly for community and primary school rehabilitation and upgrading. Finally, the
impending graduation of large numbers of primary VI students and the necessity of providing additional boarding places if
children from relatively remote communities are to have access to further schooling influenced the civil works component to
emphasize the higher grades of basic education. Enrollments in these grades are anticipated to increase from 10,206 in 1997
to 17,505 in 2002 on the basis of existing enrollments in lower primary classes.
B. A strong emphasis on vocational training both inside and outside of schools was initially proposed but eventually
withdrawn. The issue of developing demand-driven structures of vocational-technical training in specific fields was
considered to be of increasing importance. However, the recognition of the high costs associated with these programs in
general and also in Bhutan's existing technical institutions where unit recurrent costs are between Nu 30,000 and 50,000
compared to a high school unit cost of around Nu 5000, led to a project development focusing on the core of basic education,
building on the first education project. The high costs of the technical training programs and the anecdotal evidence that the
graduates are not actively competed for by employers suggests that a significant evaluation of low public cost alternatives is
required prior to any significant expansion of facilities. Rough estimates indicate that with the current structure of unit and
total costs in existing vocational and technical training courses, to result in a social internal rate of return of a modest 10
percent, the graduate of the three year Royal Bhutan Polytechnic would need to be about twice as productive as his/her class
X colleague who immediately entered the labor force. Similarly, the graduate of the Royal Technical Institute would need to
be slightly more than 100% more productive than his/her class XIII colleague. Actual earnings differentials based on
Government grade and pay scales are around one third higher in each of these cases.
C. During project preparation, an initial acceptance of a projected significant increase in the number and share of foreign
teachers in the total cadre of secondary teachers was reversed and greater emphasis placed on the expansion of teacher
training. In addition to the orientation in teacher training in Bhutan being increasingly dissimilar to that in neighboring
countries to that in Bhutan, it is becoming increasingly difficult to recruit foreign teachers at prevailing salary rates.
Estimations of the additional salaries required to attract foreign teachers, with a possible knock-on effect on the salaries of
Bhutanese teachers, compared to the costs of increasing the level of training in the existing teacher training institutions
suggested that, in the medium term, the latter strategy would be most cost effective.
Project benefits.
The project has two major components. The first will provide additional places for primarv grades PP-VI and also for grades
VII and VIII which complete the basic education cycle. While the specific evidence does not exist, there is no reason to
believe that in Bhutan the economic returns to literacy nor the impact on fertility, child morbidity and mortality and
nutritional status of the family will be significantly below those recorded elsewhere. To these may be added the importance of
the impact of a common primary schooling on the consolidation of national identity. Expansion of places in grades VII and
VIII requires further consideration. The argument put forward by Government in expanding basic education to encompass
these grades is that grade VI leavers are too young for employment and that the investments made in children in grades I -



Annex 4 (cont'd.)
Bhutan: Second Education Project
VI need to be built upon to maximize the benefits. In addition, already 83 percent of grade VI leavers currently enter grade
VII.
Currently, class VIII leavers find little difficulty finding training courses or employment. In recent years the concern has
been more that the available places in trades training courses and in teacher training have not been filled. However, in a
small labor market such as exists in Bhutan, shortages can soon turn into surpluses. As part of the enrollments and education
finance model (described below), data on places in training courses have been gathered and compared to the graduates of the
formal education system. The estimates are conservative and several other opportunities are likely to exist. In 1997, 3387
students will graduate from class VIII and at least 3050 places are estimated to be available for them in further schooling or
in full time training courses. Similarly, 1,450 students will graduate from class X and training places exist for at least 1,050.
A general consensus is that employment is available for the rest. By the end of the 8th Plan in 2002, graduates of class VIII
will increase to 6,500 and of class X to 3,255. With a constant level of training places, 1,050 and 2,100 graduates of classes
VIII and X respectively will require direct employment. If places in training courses were to increase at the anticipated rate
of growth of the economy, all class VIII graduates would be absorbed while around 1700 class X graduates would require
employment. Many jobs, currently, are filled by non-nationals. In absolute numbers these positions, plus those which will be
generated over the next six to eight years in hydro power construction and related services, would appear to offer sufficient
employment opportunities for school leavers. At issue, however, will be the skill mix and the length of time that it will take
in Bhutan (as elsewhere) for employment expectations to merge with opportunities.
As part of project preparations, a tracer study of a significant proportion of 199.5/96 class VIII and X leavers was undertaken
through questionnaires to schools and follow-up visits as a first stage in establishing a permanent monitoring system. The
response rate was very high compared to the typical survey of this type. The work and further education/training experiences
of 1790 and 770 class VIII and class X leavers respectively, 9 - 12 months foLlowing graduation were sampled. The results
are presented in table 1.

Note: the category 'Other' covers those who are known to have retumed to their village, girls who have married and
are housewives and those not located.
Ninety percent of class VIII leavers are known to be still within the education/training system. Of the remaining ten percent,
most are likely to be back in their village. Of the class X leavers, eighty seven percent remain within the system and a
maximum of thirteen percent have so far entered the labor market. So far, the youthfulness of the education/training system
and the small number of students involved (in 1996 enrollments in class VIII and X were 3678 and 1395 respectively) allows
the vast majority of class VIII and X leavers to delay their entry to the labor market until they have completed tertiary
education/training. The high rates of growth of enrollments in basic education over the past few years suggest that the
situation may change rapidly. This, and the small size of the wage labor market, implies that tracer exercise such as the one
reported above needs to become institutionalized. This is being proposed within Government.



Annex 4 (cont'd.)
Bhutan: Second Education Project
The second main component of the project aims to raise the quality of schooling across grades pre-primary to VIII. Since
around 75,000 of the 84,500 enrollments are in the primary grades, PP - VI, most of the benefits of the interventions will
accrue to this group. The impact on learning will be measured through the standardized tests being prepared as part of the
project. The economic impact will be felt through increases in system's internal efficiency as described above and through
productivity gains from grade VIII leavers who directly enter employment and eventually from graduates of higher grades as
they graduate and enter the labor force.
Cost effectiveness.
There will be gains in economic efficiency as higher quality schooling results in lower dropout rates and, more important,
lower rates of repetition. Potentially such gains are large ( see estimates in Project alternatives above).
Poverty reduction and project targeting.
The uncertainty of the size of the population and the large share of output which is not marketed in Bhutan results in
unreliable estimates of per capita income. The official estimate for 1995 is US$450. No studies of income distribution exist.
The minimum Government daily wage is Rs. 50, equal to US$ 1.38. The lowest Government salary range is between US$67-
83 a month. The project, through expanding the coverage of basic schooling and increasing its quality, will in general
increase the potential of young people to be more productive than otherwise, resulting in higher incomes and a greater
recognition of the opportunities to improve their own lives and those eventually of their families. More particularly, the
project will increase boarding places in classes VII and VIII by over 2000 enabling more children from relatively remote
areas to continue their schooling beyond the level they would otherwise reach. It is generally the case that geographically
remote households are the poorest.
Fiscal impact.
The education sector absorbs around 14 percent of total Government recurrent expenditures and 24 percent of recurrent
development expenditures. It is the highest spending sector. Since funding for the proposed project will be the largest source
of additional resources for the expansion and improved quality of the sector over the next five years and will eventually have
financial repercussions throughout the sector, analysis of the broad fiscal impact is required. Economic growth during the 7th
Plan period averaged 5.8 percent a year. Over the 8th Plan period (1997-2002), Government forecasts this to increase to 6.5
percent. Government revenues are anticipated to increase by 7.2 percent a year and the overall average fiscal deficit to be
equal to one percent of GDP. The Bank's 1996 CEM notes that Bhutan pursues prudent fiscal policies and achieved a fiscal
surplus in 1995/96, and projects a GDP annual growth rate of over 6 percent over the next five years. The report, however,
suggests that the fiscal projections in the 8th Plan are optimistic in both the anticipation of donor finance for recurrent
expenditures (mainly grants from India) and the underlying growth of expenditures and planned expansion, particularly of
health and education. While the report accepts that progress has been made in establishing a realistic framework for
forecasting recurrent expenditures in education, it notes that similar progress has not been made in the health sector.
The Guidelines for the preparation of the 8th Plan stipulated that, apart from the requirements of a general salary increase,
recurrent allocations would remain constant in real terms apart from in education and in health where a 3 percent annual
increase would be allowed in each case. The final Plan document projects total expenditures 45 percent above those in the
7th plan period with education expenditures 65 percent higher. Between 1997/98 and 2001/2 nominal expenditures on
education are projected to increase by 8 percent a year (apart from the general salary increase). Accounting for inflation on
goods and services and salary increments, there is an allowance for around 4 percent a year in real expenditures. The
enrollment and system objectives adopted by the Education Division are forecast to be roughly financially viable within the
8th Plan allocations though this may be overly optimistic on two counts. First, primary school teachers will need to increase
by around 45 percent and secondary teachers almost double during the period. Overall, the teaching stock will need to
increase by 9 percent a year. While the average salary of new teachers will be below the average teacher salary it is likely that
there will be upward pressure on allocations. However, both the Planning and Finance Ministries have given assurances that
all teachers graduating from the colleges will be employed. The second reason is more important. The gross enrollment rate
in primary school is around 72 percent and approximately 69 percent of 6 year olds enter the first year of schooling. A key
assumption of the enrollment and financial projections is that enrollments into the pre-primary class will increase by an
average of 5.5 percent a year. Estimates of the birth and child mortality rates suggest a six year old age group increasing by



Annex 4 (cont'd.)
Bhutan: Second Education Project
3.0 - 3.2 percent a year. If the projections are held to, the gross enrollment rate will be around 85 percent by the end of the
8th Plan which is well below the Govermment's objectives. In practice, however, recent experience suggests that parental
demand for enrollment growth in pre-primary will be higher with a consequent pressure for some increased financial
resources.
Total education recurrent expenditure in 1996/97 was Nu 267 million and the projected total recurrent allocations to the
sector over the five year project period are Nu 2089 million. The project sjize is US$21.18 million including an RGOB
centribution of US$1.96 million or Nu 80 million (largely for teachers' salaries) which is equal to 4 percent of planned
recurrent expenditure. Cumulative Government incremental recurrent allocations to education over the period are Nu 314
million. Project needs will be equal to almost one quarter of these. Since the project is the main single vehicle for sector
expansion during the period, the requirement for Government funds is capable of being met, provided the aggregate revenue
and expenditure patterns projected in the 8th Plan are realized.
Addendum. The Government's Education Financing Model
A major effort during project preparation has been to increase significantly the capacity within the Government to model
enrollment, financial and other flows within the education system. The model developed goes beyond financial projections of
the system and their relation to forecasts of government expenditure and includes both a teacher demand and supply model
(including the need for expatriates) and assessments of the available schooling/i:raining opportunities for graduates from each
level of the system and required employment opportunities. The model is now completely incorporated within the Division of
Education's management structure and has been used extensively at each stage of project preparation and for the preparation
of the Five Year Plan 1997-2002.
The model has four components covering enrollments, teachers, recurrent costs and capital costs:
(a) The enrollments projections run to 2007 (end of 9th Plan) based on 1997 enrollments and internal efficiency rates for
1995/96. Projected school enrollments are disaggregated by gender and by private/public schools. Enrollments in
vocational/technical education and in colleges are disaggregated by specialization.
(b) The teacher component estimates the supply and demand for teachers by levels of education. The supply projections are
disaggregated by nationality. The demand projections rely on the enrollment projections.
(c) Recurrent cost projections are for primary and secondary education. Costs include all salary costs and non personnel costs
such as textbooks, stationery, utilities, maintenance, teacher travel, student stipend, food, administration. Overall recurrent
costs of the two sub sectors are compared with each other and with projections of the total education budget. They are based
on unit costs and on the student, boarders and teacher projections.
(d) Capital costs are divided between those for upgrading existing facilities and those for increased enrollments. Again the
projections draw on student and boarder projections.
Since its development in late 1995, the model has been used simulating a large set of policy options in the development,
largely, of primary and general secondary education. These have included:
(i) showing the tradeoffs for various rates of primary and secondary enrollment growth within a recurrent budget constraint
and the implications for the employment of non national teachers e.g. for a given rate of growth of primary enrollment what
rate of growth of secondary enrollment is feasible within a 3 percent growth of the recurrent budget and what share of
teachers would need to be non national?
(ii) calculating the various combinations of enrollment growth feasible under assumptions of various growth rates of the
recurrent budget e.g. for recurrent expenditures increasing at 2 percent and at 4 percent what enrollment growth alternatives
are feasible?
(iii) the impact on primary and secondary schooling of an increase in the share of overall education expenditure.
(iv) the impact on gross enrollment ratios of reductions in dropout and repetition under a fixed recurrent budget.
(v) the impact of an increase in the share of private education, reductions in Government subsidies for stationary, textbooks
and stipends, an increase in class size, a reduction in the unit cost of construction and an increase in the salary scale.
(vi) demonstrating the implications for enrollment growth of increases in unit costs resulting from higher quality teaching as
a result of more inservice courses and curriculum development.



Annex 4 (cont'd.)
Bhutan: Second Education Project
In addition to enabling the overall financing requirements of particular strategies, including that supported by the project, the
model has also been used for other purposes including analyses of:
Trade-offs between small schools and large schools with boarding. Boarding facilities add an additional 40 percent to the
capital cost of a place in a junior secondary school while the recurrent unit cost (including WFP food) is double. An
alternative is to establish more local community schools and extend the grades they cover. In sparsely populated areas the
pupil teacher ratio would need to be smaller and the unit costs higher. The model has been used to calculate thefifmancial
impact of an extension of the community school mode of delivery and determine the lowest pupil:teacher ratio below which
the boarding place option is the most economic.
Repetition dropouts and increased efficiency. The model includes a detailed student flow submodel which allows calculation
of the level of internal efficiency and the costs of inefficiencies at each level of the education system. The results have been
used in discussions of the advantages and disadvantages of repetition practices.
Teachers labor market. Both the supply and demand for teachers provide problems in Bhutan. The small numbers of
secondary school and higher education graduates in the past, and the competition for them, have limited teacher supply. The
relatively rapid expansion of school enrollments in recent years has resulted in a shortage of Bhutanese teachers and the need
for overseas recruitment. Policies to Bhutanize the teaching force have implications for feasible school growth rates and these
rates in tum partially determine future rates of Bhutanization. Policies to expand the length of basic schooling require not
only more teachers but the teachers of teachers. Given the small absolute size of the education system, shortages of teachers
can soon become surpluses. All these factors result in a need to understand future requirements and the timing, sources and
constraints on teacher supply. The model has again been particularly useful in providing quantitative estimates on which to
base the important debates on teacher policy.

Procurement Arrangements and Allocation of the Credit Proceeds
Procurement Methods: Procurement for implementation would be undertaken by the Project Co-
ordination Unit of Education Division with the assistance of the Schools Planning and Building Cell of
DOE for construction contracting. The SPBC had established a good track record in contract management
under the recently closed Bhutan Primary Education Project. Specific procurement arrangements,
summarized in Table A, are as follows:
a) Civil Works (US$11.6 million). Contracts would be awarded through National Competitive Bidding
(NCB) procedures using IDA approved standard bidding documents (SBD's). It is expected that during the
first year of the project the RGOB will seek IDA clearance to propose the use of a standard National
Competitive Bidding Contract format currently being prepared for all sectors. Contracts will be advertised
nationally with bid opening at the District Level and the contract award being determined under the
guidance and supervision of the SPBC of the MOHE. Contract sizes would range from US$ 350,000 to
$1.2 million with a few smaller contracts being awarded for access roads and for minor construction.
Almost all contracts will be above the district tender limits and such awards will be determined by an inter-
ministerial tender board. Bidding would be on a per-school basis and take place over the course of the first
3 years of the project. Contract packaging is not considered feasible. The prior review threshold is set for $
700,000 which would cover 60 % of contracts (8) and 70% by value. Post review would be undertaken for
all other contracts.
b) Furniture (US$1.1 million). Contracts for procurement of furniture estimated to cost less than
US$25,000 equivalent may be awarded on the basis of national shopping procedures with solicitation of
quotations from at least three suppliers up to an aggregate limit of $150,000.  Contracts for the
procurement of furniture estimated to cost more than US$25,000 equivalent per contract may be awarded
on the basis of NCB procedures acceptable to IDA.
c) Equipment and Materials (US$0.99 million). Contracts for the procurement of Equipment and
Materials estimated to cost less than US$25,000 equivalent per contract may be awarded on the basis of
national shopping procedures with solicitation of price quotations from at least 3 suppliers up to an
aggregate limit of $150,000. Contracts for the procurement of Equipment and Materials estimated to cost
less than US$125,000 equivalent per contract may be awarded on the basis of NCB procedures acceptable
to IDA up to an aggregate limit of $500,000. Contracts for the procurement of Equipment and Materials
estimated to cost more than US$125,000 equivalent per contract shall be awarded on the basis of ICB.
d) Fellowship Training (US$0.19 million). Placement will be in regional institutes selected by RGOB in
consultation with IDA. Fellowship costs of tuition will be at the institutional rates. Per diems and other
costs of transportation and student maintenance will be payable at the applicable UNDP or RGOB rates.
e) Specialist Services (US$0.1 million) IDA would finance the cost of site supervisors to oversee
construction at the District level during project implementation. Up to 12 individuals would be selected
following local advertisement. Terms and conditions would be determined by RGOB sufficient to
encourage applications from qualified individuals. Recruitment would be in accordance with the provisions
of the Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers, dated January 1997.

Special Account
in order to facilitate disbursements, a special account in an amount of US$700,000 will be opened
in the Bank of Bhutan to be operated by the Project Coordination Unit based in Thimphu under
terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA. The Bank Group would make an initial deposit of
US$350,000 until withdrawals from the Credit have reached SDR 3 million. The Education
Division would submit replenishment applications for the Special Account on a monthly basis, or
when 50% of the authorized allocation has been used, whichever occurs first. The replenishment
applications will be supported by the necessary documentation: a bank statement of the Special
Account would  include a reconciliation of the Special Account against IDA's records.
Replenishment of the Special Account would follow IDA procedures. The Special Account would
be audited annually by the Royal Audit Authority; certified copies of the audited accounts and
financial statements for each fiscal year, together with the auditor's report and the auditor's
opinion on the statement of expenditure (SOE) would made available to IDA no later than 6
months after the end of the fiscal year. IDA may require withdrawals from the Credit Account to
be made on the basis of SOE for expenditures: (a) for wcrks under contracts costing less than
US$200,000 equivalent each, (b) for equipment, furniture and materials under contracts costing
less than US$100,000 equivalent each, (c) for consultants' services under contracts costing less
than US$100,000 equivalent each in the case of firms, and under contracts costing less than
US$50,000 equivalent each in the case of individuals, and (d) for all training, all under such terms
and conditions as IDA shall specify by notice to the Borrower.
