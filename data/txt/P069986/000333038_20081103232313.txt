1.      Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

Summary

The Integrated Community Development Project (ICDP) was conceived as a third in a series
of community development projects designed to address poverty (especially through
temporary job creation) and restoration of economic and social infrastructure in marginalized
areas. It was also intended to build Palestinian institutions. The project proved to be resilient
throughout an ever worsening security, political and economic context. The ever increasing
restrictions on movement of people and goods continued to be a significant constraint.
Nevertheless, the flexibility of the project design enabled it continue to provide critical
infrastructure services such as improved rural roads, water supply and sanitation, school
facilities, community centers and public spaces that are of a developmental nature, while
many other donors reverted to emergency humanitarian assistance. However, institutional
development took second place to getting the work completed.

The original project design anticipated donor co-financing which did not materialize but the
impact on overall project outcomes was mitigated by the Bank's Additional Financing (AF) in
2006.     At its closing, the project had exceeded its planned output indicators (150
microprojects) to 223 at project closing. The AF was designed to respond to emergency
conditions when donors stopped funding the Palestinian Authority (PA) following the
electoral success of Hamas, deepening the economic crisis and causing poverty rates to spiral.
The flexibility of the design of the ICDP, especially the AF allowed the completion of
desperately needed job creation activities in Gaza in 2007, a period of total isolation. At
closing, ICDP had created temporary employment for over 5,000 individuals in Gaza. Over
80 percent of beneficiaries expressed satisfaction with microproject outcomes (compared to
the 60 percent target) and successfully reached women and youth. Its lessons have already
been passed to a new generation of community development projects (the Village and
Neighborhood Development Project) with greater emphasis on local participation and
community capacity building.

Despite ICDP's remarkable achievements in a fragile context, its overly ambitious project
development objective, shortcomings in monitoring and evaluation (e.g., lack of baseline data,
output based performance indicators), implementation difficulties and modest impact in
institutional development, result in an overall rating of moderately satisfactory.

1.1     Context at Appraisal

The project was appraised in the context of prolonged insecurity and socio-economic
breakdown following the onset of the second `intifada' (Palestinian uprising) in September
2000. The continuing insecurity coupled with closures and restrictions on movement of
people and goods had reversed economic gains made since the Oslo Accords of 1993 and was
estimated by mid-2002 to have increased poverty levels, pushing those below the poverty line
(over one million Palestinians) from 20% to 40%. Poverty and the collapse of social services
were especially prevalent in those communities most isolated by closures.

In such a crisis, the Bank's interim strategy was to continue poverty reduction while
supporting emergency interventions such as temporary job creation and budgetary support to
maintain minimum service levels, all to avoid the total collapse of the Palestinian economy.
This was reaffirmed in the December 18, 2003 "Trust Fund for Gaza and the West Bank


                                                4

(TFGWB): Status Strategy, and Request for Replenishment" which summarized the Bank's
goal to balance efforts to manage the emergency nature of the current situation with a
continued focus on a medium-term development agenda. Within that strategy, which acted as
reference point and framework for projects since West Bank Gaza (WBG) did not have a
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), the ICDP and its additional financing were deemed fully
consistent with the stated objective of strengthening capacities for and financing the delivery
of basic services to the poor.

Following two previous community development projects, the ICDP was appraised as a key
instrument in the Bank's poverty reduction strategy, financing investments in local
infrastructure and institutions necessary for economic growth and employment. The ICDP
was conceived as operating at a local level below municipalities, fostering community
participation, targeting rural and refugee populations and relieving the isolation of worst-hit
communities.


1.2     Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
approved)

PDO: Improved quality and availability of basic social and economic services in poor and
marginalized communities of WBG.

Key indicators:
*       90 percent of microprojects improve quality and availability of basic services for a
        minimum of two years from the end of the defects liability period, according to
        microproject status reports
*       75 percent of microproject financing awarded to communities located in regions with
        poverty incidence above 20 percent, according to WBG poverty map
*       60 percent of microproject financing awarded to communities with population less
        than 5,000
*       60 percent of beneficiaries express satisfaction with the level of citizen involvement in
        preparation and implementation of a microproject in their community, according to
        survey of beneficiaries
*       60 percent of surveyed beneficiaries express the microproject had a positive impact on
        their access to services.


1.3     Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

The PDO was not revised. However, the key performance indicators (KPIs) for the PDOs and
outputs by component were slightly revised following the AF to remove redundancies,
provide greater precision, and include targets for labor content. The indicator on poverty
targeting was dropped since due to the severe economic downturn, nearly all regions had high
levels of poverty incidence. Poverty targeting is difficult since data are not disaggregated at
the level of local government.

The revised KPIs for the PDO and as monitored in the Implementation Supervision Reports
are below:
*       60 percent of beneficiaries express satisfaction with the level of citizen involvement in


                                                5

        preparation and implementation of a microproject in their community, according to
        survey of beneficiaries
*       60 percent of surveyed beneficiaries express the microproject had a positive impact on
        their access to services.

See Annex 2 for a detailed presentation of revised KPIs of the output indicators.

1.4     Main Beneficiaries,

The PAD identified more than half a million Palestinians in at least one hundred small and
poor communities who would benefit from improved availability and quality of basic services
and from greater economic activity due to demand for local labor and materials (assumes
average population per microproject 5,000). The poor in marginalized rural communities and
refugee camps in particular would benefit from infrastructure improvements such as schools,
clinics, water supply and sanitation, which have a high social return. Ten communities and
75,000 people (halved by the time of implementation) would benefit from the telecenters. The
PAD also indicated general benefits for those in the agricultural sector. Local Government
Units and national implementation partners (PECDAR, Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of
Local Government, and the Department of Refugee Affairs) would benefit from some
capacity and institutional building activities through supply of office and service equipment,
needed technical studies and some training in administration and project management.

The additional financing project paper identified youth and women as priority vulnerable
groups for microprojects. The Additional Financing also envisaged the implementation of 50
community development microprojects. Those would include civil works for construction,
essential furniture and goods, and resources for training and technical services to improve
planning, consultation and management capacities of communities.

1.5     Original Components (as approved)

(i).    Community Development Microprojects ($17.65m)
        Grants to local government units and farmers cooperatives to finance a minimum of
        100 microprojects, including civil works for water supply, waste management, health
        clinics, schools, roads, irrigation networks, etc.
(ii).   Community Telecenters ($1.75m)
        Ten multipurpose centers involving civil works, equipment such as computers, and
        specialist services.
(iii).  Project Management ($0.60m)
        Incremental operating costs for Ministry of Local Government (MOLG), Palestinian
        Economic Council for Development and Reconstruction (PECDAR), Ministry of
        Agriculture (MOA) and Department of Refugee Affairs (DORA).

1.6     Revised Components

The component for Community telecenters was halved because anticipated donor funds did
not materialize. Reasons for lack of donor funds are: (i) ICTs were no longer considered a
priority given the emergency conditions and donor funds went to emergency employment and
(ii) preference of donors to implement projects through line ministries to contribute to
building key pillars of a future Palestinian state.       The AF financed the component for




                                                6

microprojects since this mitigated against the deepening economic crisis and put a stress on
high labor content (setting the target at 30 percent).

1.7     Other significant changes

The additional grant financing ($5m) of February 2007 extended the scope and flexibility of
the project through a period of uncertainty when international donor contact and assistance to
the PA was halted as a result of Hamas's electoral success. The AF simplified project
coordination, and placed a greater emphasis on community participation in the identification
and implementation of microprojects.          An important innovation was the addition of
community procurement.


2.      Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1     Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Clearly at the time of appraisal it was easier for the task team to look back at the lessons of
the first two community projects and design the project accordingly than to predict and
accommodate the unknown future security and political context. The PAD included extensive
discussion of the lessons of Community Development Projects 1 and 2 (CDP I & CDPII), and
attempted to correct the deficiencies in ICDP.          In particular, ICDP differed from its
predecessors in (i) improving livelihoods in refugee camps where UNRWA, the key service
provider, was increasingly stretched (ii) targeting rural employment and productivity in the
agricultural sector, and (iii) piloting new initiatives to reduce isolation through access to
information and communication technologies.

The design and approach was relatively simple. With hindsight, it might be argued that some
of the implementation arrangements promoting participation and levels of coordination were
unrealistic given that the insecurity and closures were already several months underway and
likely to continue. However, the project had to be consistent with the Bank's strategy which
continued to balance service provision with broader institution-building objectives. The
design therefore had to straddle the emergency provision and development goals. The PAD
was candid about the high risks involved and the likelihood of low sustainability. The design
included measures to mitigate these risks as far as possible, for example the use of local
materials and labor to avoid problems of closure and access. In any event, the design proved
fairly resilient to the continued insecurity and political changes over the following five years.
The additional financing provided an opportunity for adapting the design to changing
circumstances, demonstrating the flexibility of design and the pro-activity of the Bank team
and counterparts in strengthening the project.

The lack of anticipated donor finance (due to a shift in interest to emergency job creation
following the onset of the second intifada) was clearly a set-back resulting in a reduction of
project expenditure from $20m to $15m at closing. The ICR notes that restructuring the
project was an option during the preparation of the AF, but was rejected in favor of a simple
pro rata adjustment of components. With hindsight, this may have been a missed opportunity
to re-set the ambitious PDOs. On the other hand restructuring may have led to unacceptable
delays, and with ever-changing circumstances, a re-structured project might itself be
overtaken by events. The project's strategic potential was also missed due to the absence of
donor interest and coordination among those active in community development.



                                                7

2.2    Implementation

PECDAR, a public independent reconstruction agency, was the primary implementor and in
the prevailing context, often required `crisis management' measures to achieve results.
Implementation progress, which necessarily focuses on the performance of PECDAR, is well
recorded in the Project Status Reports/ Implementation Status Reports (PSR/ISRs) and the
borrower's own ICR (annex 7).            Ratings are predominantly satisfactory with some
downgrading for temporary problems which were corrected.              The mid-term review in
December 2004 picked up on deficiencies, especially delays on the establishment of
telecenters, and promoted correctional action. Implementation of the telecenters was clearly
more problematic, requiring more management input, and in PECDAR's view would have
been better as a separate project rather than an attachment to ICDP. The mid-term review also
injected fresh impetus into the capacity-building/training activities which had been lagging.

The original institutional and implementation arrangements which included two coordination
committees of multiple stakeholders proved unwieldy, and by the time of the additional
financing the steering committee only met sporadically. The additional financing proposed
an improvement of the lower-level "Technical Committee", which would become the primary
decision-making body, in place of the steering committee. Also, Ministry of Agriculture was
not longer part of the technical committee since the AF did not include agricultural activities.
In general, MOLG, MOA and DORA played a limited role in project coordination and
complained of PECDAR's tendency to hijack decision-making. For them, collaboration on
training was disappointing. Achievements on training under the project as a whole were
modest (see 3.5 (b) with little impact on partner agencies and participating communities.

The use of the Community Development Consultant (CDC) was not as effective as intended,
though still useful. The records show that PECDAR and the Bank struggled to reach full
agreement about the relevance of the role. PECDAR remained of the view that the job was
too broad and rather warranted specialist inputs at key points, not a permanent position. The
Bank maintained that the CDC was critical to ensuring community participation in project
selection, procurement and monitoring. In the additional financing, the late appointment of
the second CDC was considered a "missed opportunity" but both CDCs provided useful
interventions at various stages in the project cycle.

The refinements to implementation under the additional financing were notable. The short
period available for implementation determined the feasibility and choice of microproject type
- smaller in size and with less emphasis on infrastructure. The open call for proposals
provided a transparency not so evident in the first phase of the project. AF implementation in
Gaza was particularly flexible and effective. Putting aside an earlier list of infrastructure
projects, it provided critical assistance where no donor money was going in, reaching youth
and women as priority beneficiaries with job-creation interventions through local NGOs. The
revision in the project's expenditure categories (from the standard goods, works and services
to a single "microproject" category) also expedited implementation processes and
disbursements by lowering the number of transactions.


2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

The fundamental problem with project M&E was that no base-line data existed on which to
judge project outcome. Moreover PDO indicators were all output, not outcome, indicators.



                                                8

Although this does not meet current Bank results standards, this appears to have been
acceptable at the time of design. This omission makes it harder for the project to demonstrate
that it met its PDO.

Nevertheless, the PAD contained exact performance indicators that were maintained through
the project supervision and retained in the ISRs with some slight revisions for the additional
financing. The PAD also provided for an increased community role in monitoring and
evaluation, working with the CDC to identify impact of the microprojects.

Regular beneficiary assessments, procurement and technical reviews were part of the design.
The project benefitted from a mid-way technical and social evaluation and concluded with a
beneficiary impact assessment consistent with the consultative goals of the project.

In practice, the Bank reported that the performance indicators were not always monitored and
updated rigorously, and the task team worked closely with PECDAR on improving the focus
and quality of outcome monitoring and progress reporting for this dominantly out-put focused
organization. There was gradual progress in PECDAR's monitoring and reporting on ICDP
outcomes between start and completion, with notable improvements in the final year of the
actual 6-year project life. This improvement was credited to the appointment of the CDC in
the West Bank; close supervision and periodic comments from the Bank's team, and the
streamlining and consolidation of the Key Performance Indicators.

Despite these efforts, the extent and quality of M&E is rated unsatisfactory.

2.4     Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
(Focusing on issues and their resolution, as applicable)

Financial Management

Throughout the life of ICDP, PECDAR/PMU issued regular quarterly and annual financial
reports which were received by the Bank on a timely manner. Auditors' opinions have always
been unqualified. The Auditors' Management Letter also indicated that there were no material
weaknesses in PECDAR's internal control systems or material misstatements in the Project
Financial Statements. PECDAR maintained an effective internal control system to ensure that
project expenditures are properly authorized, supporting documents are maintained, accounts
are reconciled periodically and project assets, including cash, are safeguarded.

Procurement

The procurement capacity and performance of PECDAR improved during the ICDP
implementation, with the rating rising from unsatisfactory to moderately satisfactory, and,
most recently, satisfactory. During the early stages of implementation and until early 2007,
weak procurement capacity and lack of sound organization at PECDAR contributed to delays
in the project. Initially, procurement plans, as per the requirements of the TFCA, were not
available. Post reviews revealed cases of non compliance with the TFCA, especially in
proper record keeping and documentation. With the Bank's close support, however,
procurement activities including planning noticeably improved.

The AF included community procurement, an innovation which was used for all subsequent
micro-projects, strengthening ownership at both the local government and community levels.


                                                9

Furthermore, it improved the procurement capacity of the implementing Local Government
Units and enhanced PECDRA's ability to supervise communities in project implementation.

Environmental and Social Safeguards

An initial environmental assessment was conducted in accordance with OP 4.01 for category
B projects. The operations manual provided for environmental screening of microprojects at
their appraisal. Microprojects involving any involuntary resettlement or expropriation were
excluded to avoid any social safeguard issues. An environmental assessment was conducted
in November 2005 which concluded that "Generally all the assessed projects are found to
have positive impacts on the environmental elements ..."               An updated Environmental
Management Plan (EMP) for the additional financing phase was completed in November
2007.     The CDC was involved in social screening of projects to ensure environmental
compliance of microprojects.

2.5      Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

The maintenance and sustainability of the infrastructure such as roads is covered for one year
post construction by project protocol. Beyond that, a memorandum of understanding provides
that village councils, ministries and other beneficiaries undertake maintenance. However, for
the most part, they lack the skills, capacity or resources, and the project did not make
sufficient gains in institutional capacity to make a difference.

There was no successor project to ICDP, although a newly-designed Village and
Neighborhood Development project (VNDP) was developed with the MOLG to further the
work on community-driven development. It was approved by the Board in February 2008
one month before the closure of ICDP. The VNDP was designed (i) to promote local
ownership of development assistance, and (ii) to promote consolidation of local government
units throughout implementation. Preparation of the VNDP clearly benefitted from the
experience of all three CDPs.


3.       Assessment of Outcomes

3.1      Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
The objectives, design and implementation of ICDP were highly relevant to Palestinian development
priorities and the Bank assistance strategy as they evolved through the lifetime of the project. At a
minimum, the project provided infrastructure to support the continued provision of much needed
services and employment through the volatile context. ICDP also contributed, albeit modestly, to
institution and capacity-building at a time when all parties were keen not to lose sight of longer-term
development gains. Implementation was adjusted to the realities of insecurity, closures, the isolation of
Gaza, political changes in the PA, and donor ambivalence.



3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
Because of a lack of baseline data and the fact that performance indicators were output, rather
than outcome based, ICDP's overall achievement of PDOs can only be inferred from a
combination of evidential sources. The ICDP exceeded its objective as measured against its
key performance indicators: 71 percent of microprojects were implemented in communities
with less than a population of 5,000 as compared to the target of 60 percent; 83 percent of
surveyed beneficiaries expressed satisfaction with microproject outcomes, compared to the


                                                 10

target of 60 percent. In addition, the project successfully implemented 223 microprojects,
compared to the target of 150. Consistent with the project target, 50 percent of microprojects
included beneficiary in-kind contribution which reflects community ownership. Third, as
detailed in the borrowers ICR (annex 7) the completed infrastructure stands as a testament to
the project's intent to connect marginalized and small communities with larger communities
and associated services.


3.3     Efficiency
Since there were no directly quantifiable revenue streams to compare the costs generated,
most of the microprojects and activities financed under ICDP did not qualify for a standard
cost-benefit analysis. The project financed infrastructure to support basic services to the poor
in demoralizing circumstances where a traditional rate of return analysis was hard to calculate
and arguably inappropriate. (The Bank's own Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) reports
indicate that the focus in West Bank Gaza should be on institutional development rather than
economic considerations). Regarding efficiency, people in areas with high poverty levels do
not have the means to pay for basic infrastructure such as water, sanitation, electricity, roads
or services such as health, social protection or education. The ICDP provided an opportunity
to subsidize the production of basic services infrastructure by financing part of the production
cost.

In terms of calculating unit costs and comparing them to other similar operations elsewhere in
the world, this was also difficult in WBG, primarily due to the volatile economic environment.
In addition, restrictions on movement of people and goods contributed to excessive
inefficiency, scarcity of goods, and increase in transaction costs, all leading to relatively high
prices of raw materials and other inputs. Unit cost comparisons are therefore unreliable. That
said, merely the short-term employment generation under the AF (amounting to almost 30%
of project funding) is a concrete return. (Further analysis of efficiency is provided in Annex 3).

3.4     Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
(Combining relevance, achievement of PDOs, and efficiency)
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
Notwithstanding the overall deterioration (or lack of improvement in) in social and economic
conditions, services and sustainability, the ICDP clearly contributed to arresting that trend,
where it operated, and meeting the core PDO of improving the quality and availability of
basic services in poor and marginalized communities as confirmed by the beneficiary impact
assessment.    However, given the lack of baseline data, the rating is modified by the
disconnect between the ambitious PDO and inadequacy of the KPIs to monitor and measure
"improvement in quality and availability of services."

3.5     Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a)     Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
Poverty impacts and beneficiary satisfaction (especially among women) achieved high scores
in both the implementer's ICR and beneficiary impact assessment. Fifty five percent of the
microprojects in the AF specifically benefited youth and women. Job creation benefitted the
poorest households, especially in Gaza which reached 5,295 heads of households (170,000
person-months) and was particularly successful in benefitting women. The labor content of
the Gaza projects under the AF reached 95 percent, far exceeding the target of 30 percent in
the project design. The BIA also reports that 63% of project beneficiaries came from below



                                               11

the poverty line.      Nevertheless, the project could have done better at empowering
communities and building their capacities. Overall community participation in the project (as
opposed to satisfaction) was rated much lower (39%), and for women specifically (18%).

(b)     Institutional Change/Strengthening

Institutional strengthening of partner institutions appears modest at best. Training might have
done more to build partner agency and community capacity. With the AF, community
procurement proved to be effective but probably came too late to achieve sustainable change.
However, institutional building at the community level was weak as noted in section 3.5 (a).

(c)     Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

Community in-kind contributions were significant, signaling community ownership and
solidarity. For example, for water projects it reached 67 percent, 55 percent for agriculture
and 50 percent for education, increasing a sense of community ownership. Although not
explicit, it is arguable that the ICDP contributed to the social cohesion of West Bank Gaza at
a time of intolerable strain. Had the project been formulated in this way, it might have
avoided some of the orthodox `developmental shortcomings' which are evident. This is
raised in section 6 on lessons learned.

3.6     Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

The final beneficiary impact assessment of March 2008 concluded that ICDP met its key
objectives with high levels of beneficiary satisfaction. However, it found that although good
efforts had been made to encourage community participation in needs and project
identification there was significant room for improvement particularly with female
participation. The BIA recommended that community needs assessments be conducted prior
to project selection with more consultation with primary users of expected services prior to
project design. This links with other findings of this ICR regarding the CDC. Had there been
CDC from the start and throughout the project, community participation might well have
scored higher.

4.      Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: High
(i) Risks beyond the control of the project
Continuing volatility of the political and security context and resulting socio-economic
impacts, coupled with the fiscal deficits of local government units, may specifically result in
deterioration to project-funded infrastructure and generally undo any `poverty-reduction
gains' made under the project.

(ii) Risks within control of the project
The maintenance and sustainability of the infrastructure such as roads is only covered for one
year post construction by project protocol. Beyond that, village councils, ministries and other
beneficiaries undertake maintenance. Whether they will have the means and motivation to do
that remains to be seen. Greater use of the CDC might have improved such capacity at the
community level.

5.     Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1    Bank Performance
(a)    Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory
The PDO was too general, ambitious and unsupported by adequate M&E with verifiable
outcome indicators. Opportunities to correct this through restructuring may have been missed.
Otherwise, the design and approach were relatively simple, based on experience, and only
over-ambitious to the extent that it attempted to be consistent with the Bank's strategy and
emphasis on capacity building. In practice, the design withstood the stresses of unforeseeable
events, even to the point where additional finance was regarded as a desirable emergency
measure with little adaptation required to the original design.

(b)    Quality of Supervision

(Including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)
Rating: Satisfactory
Problems were identified and resolved. Continuity across the three Task Team Leaders
(TTLs) was assured with good skills mix in the teams and heavy reliance on field office staff.
Reporting and use of indicators was maintained. Compliance standards were also maintained
despite the prevailing circumstances. The borrowers ICR was complimentary about Bank
support in the field.

(c)    Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
Noted deficiencies in some areas, especially M&E, prohibit a fully satisfactory rating.

5.2    Borrower Performance
(a)    Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
Government performance was largely delegated to PECDAR and otherwise satisfactory
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

PECDAR                  The infrastructure aspects of the project were implemented consistent
                        with the output performance indicators and to general beneficiary
                        approval. To achieve this in the prevailing context of insecurity and
                        restrictions on movement and access was noteworthy. Improvements
                        were required over the life of the project in areas such as
                        procurement, training and M&E.

MOLG/DORA/MOA Lack of effective participation and decision-making of partners
.

(c)    Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
PECDAR was the primary implementation agency for the project and borrower performance
necessarily equated to PECDAR's performance.

6.     Lessons Learned
Generic:
   1. Projects conducted in fragile, volatile and conflict-affected areas cannot automatically
       be measured against orthodox development measures such as economic return,
       sustainability, and policy or institutional reforms. Rather they should be assessed on
       their potential to support peace and stability, sustain human and social capital, and to
       establish the pre-conditions for development gains, in line with the Bank's new OP.8.0.
       PDOs should reflect this but the ICR format also needs adjustment to this reality.
   2. In such contexts, relevant capacity building and training initiatives tend to get
       sidelined if they are not built into the project works execution and therefore require
       special attention in design, finance and implementation.

Specific to West Bank Gaza/ICDP:
1.     Service delivery versus institution building
       In a prolonged emergency, where services decline and demand doesn't, the desire for
       institution building may have to be tempered by the need to provide the concrete
       infrastructure and services as a perceived priority. This is a trade off which will play
       out in the project design and choice of implementing agencies. Choices in the West
       Bank Gaza programs should acknowledge that the bulk of donor funds have gone into
       infrastructure.
2.     The addition of the telecenters component, though innovative, was arguably a stretch
       for PECDAR with its focus on engineering. The development of the telecenters
       required a different kind of specialism and was taxing on PECDAR's staff and
       supervision time.
3.     Lack of donor participation in funding or other collaboration should be cause for
       concern. It is understood with the onset of the intifada, many donors retreated to
       emergency aid. However, with a proliferation of donors, some continuing to work in
       community development, there should be more assertive efforts to drive a common
       framework.
4.     The role of the community development consultant (CDC) should be reinforced in
       project preparation, with buy-in from all stakeholders, and the position active up-front
       and throughout the project.
5.     Policy impact from the project would be enhanced by greater participation of the PA
       agencies. This was a cost of the project being dominated by PECDAR.

7.     Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a)    Borrower/implementing agencies

The implementing agency, PECDAR, produced a thorough ICR (see annex 7) whose
conclusions and recommendations are broadly consistent with the Bank's ICR.

(b)    Cofinanciers
None

(c)    Other partners and stakeholders

                      Annex 3        Economic and Financial Analysis

1.      In light of the predominantly demand-driven nature of the subprojects financed under
the ICDP, and hence the uncertainty in the demand for the portfolio of subprojects, the Project
Appraisal Document (PAD) did not undergo an economic analysis for the entire project ex
ante to determine the quantitative economic and welfare impacts of the ICDP. Similarly,
since there were no directly quantifiable revenue streams to compare the costs generated, most
of the subprojects and activities financed under ICDP did not qualify for a standard cost-
benefit analysis that determines net present value of the subprojects. This applied generally
across infrastructure extension and social and economic services in all sectors. At Project
completion, it remains a challenge to do an economic and financial analysis on the Project as a
whole, due to the demand-driven nature of most of the investments (approximately 90% of
Final Project Cost) and also because some of the necessary data for such analysis were not
always collected. Moreover, for subprojects financed in the agricultural sector, assumption at
appraisal was that some of those would include income generation activities. Nonetheless,
majority of the agricultural subprojects were in the form of public (free entrance) gardens,
pavement of agricultural roads, expansion of infrastructure for public veterinary facilities, and
supply of agricultural equipment for the MOA, and did not include an income-generation
focus.

Multipurpose Community Telecenters (MCTs)

2.      At appraisal, 10 Multipurpose Community Telecenters (MCTs) were envisaged of
which 5 would be financed by the Bank and 5 would be financed through donor co-financing.
The Project investment ceiling for each MCT was planned at US$150,000. The economic
justification to establish telecenters was derived from their expected social and economic
benefits through local capacity building, reducing the cost of exclusion from access to MCTs.
Quantitative analysis were to be made at time of implementation in each MCT business plan.
The lack of co-finacing led to only IDA investments materializing and 5 out of planned 81
MCTs were established (total cost reached (US$642,000). Accordingly, one could assume that
social welfare and economic benefits originally envisaged have been halved. Despite the
fewer number of MCTs, each one was established on the basis of a business plan and
sustainability was factored financially in a way for MCTs to recover initial investment costs
within 3-5 years of operation after the end of 18 months of operation under the ICDP
financing. It has been estimated that the 3 MCTs which have concluded the liability period
have recovered in their first year of independent operation around 40-50% of their operating
costs. This estimate was based on the fact that the salaries of the MCT Manager and Assistant
were covered by the municipalities.

Cost Savings from a Beneficiary Perspective

3.      The BIA at Project Completion used a sample of 130 infrastructure subprojects
distributed over the number of traditional sectors, and concluded that a little more than half the
beneficiaries (56%) stated that the implemented subprojects have saved on the cost of services.



1In the PAD, the project description sets 10 MCTs as a target while the annex on indicators
states 8.



                                               19

This is reasonable due to the fact that impact of such works is more visible in smaller
communities. Moreover, 79% of surveyed beneficiaries stated that the implemented
subprojects saved time and effort. As for indication on improvement of income, 42% of
respondents confirmed this in Gaza, as opposed to 18% in the West Bank.                 This was
attributable to the higher focus of job-creation activities in Gaza than in the West Bank. Some
results according to Project type were as follows:

4.      The reaction of surveyed beneficiaries regarding savings on costs of the roads
subprojects was rather surprising, provided the given assumption that beneficiaries had to pay
much more in travel and maintenance costs prior to implementation. As for improvement of
income, the results were influenced, inter alia, by the labor content in a given type of
infrastructure, and the permanent jobs which were created for the operation of a completed
subproject.

Job Creation Focus

5.      Jobs created under the original ICDP fund were around 140,000 person-days with
average labor content of 27%. As part of the Additional Financing, the job creation program
in Gaza, alone, created an additional 170,000 person-days for 5,295 persons over a period of 3
months with labor content exceeding 80%. Due to the high unemployment rate in WBG,
specific targeting criteria were used under ICDP original fund to ensure the worst off of the
unemployed would benefit from employment. Hence, the pre-employment scenario for those
laborers would be the negative added-value from having no income. Similarly, the daily wage
for unskilled workmanship (in construction, for example) averaged US$15-20, which is
marginally less than the prevailing market daily wage for similar workmanship. This ensured
that only the neediest of the unemployed would benefit from the job-creation activities2.
Particularly under the job-creation program in Gaza (as part of the Additional Financing), a
number of the activities implemented through 81 NGOs and Community Based Organizations
included income generation, such as handicrafts and food processing. Data were not collected
on this due to the difficult political environment in Gaza, but nonetheless is can be safely
assumed that the small income generating activities have provided financial added-value for
the beneficiaries.




2Other applied criteria included: unemployment for at least 6 months, responsibility for 4+
household members, did not benefit from other similar job-creation activities in the previous 6
months.



                                               20

6.      Of course, the temporary jobs created provided momentum to the economic
environment because due to in-direct employment (estimated by PECDAR at 15-20% of direct
employment) suppliers of raw materials also would have benefited from the selling of their
supplies. A more difficult economic benefit to quantify was in the form of temporary increase
in the spending power of the benefiting heads of households and improvement in the
economic well-fare of their families.

Financing CDD Approaches

7.      Research has shown that CDD-oriented projects are cost effective . Initial           3

implementation costs of CDD projects are usually compensated by the lower costs for
infrastructure because of the increase in social capital, in-kind community contributions, and
empowerment of communities, especially some of the traditionally marginalized groups
(women, youth, disabled, etc...).              This is confirmed by research       4demonstrating that
participatory approaches have lower unit costs in all sectors and across all countries than
traditional approaches, and that they tend to increase access to and quality of social services,
resulting in most cases in greater utilization of basic services.

8.      Given the longstanding fiscal crisis of the PA and the withholding of Palestinian
clearance revenues by the Government of Israel, public investment to maintain or add
infrastructure services in urban and rural areas has come to a halt. Moreover, in the past two
years, whatever government funds were available, were primarily used to pay civil service
salaries and cover operating costs of public institutions. As a consequence, the already low
level of transfers to local governments has evaporated, leaving all LGU socioeconomic
infrastructure investments dependant on donor financing and in rare instances, LGU-self
financing. Maintenance and expansion schemes for such infrastructure are almost none
existent due to lack of local government financing. The ICDP design assumed that 10% of the
total cost for each subproject would be contributed by the LGU (5% in cash and 5% in-kind).
In addition, an innovative scheme proposed under ICDP was to encourage LGUs to set aside a
small percentage of the total cost of a given Microproject for operation and maintenance.
However, soon after the start of implementation, PECDAR disregarded those factors in order
not to overburden the financially deficient LGUs. During Project implementation, it was
noted, however, that the majority of the Local Village Councils nonetheless provided willingly
various forms of in-kind contributions to the Projects5. Periodic site visits to LGUs reported
positively on the popularity of the notion of in-kind contributions among LGUs' management
as well as the community. Hence, in-kind contribution was later used as part of the criteria for
preference in the selection of proposed subprojects under the Additional Financing.

9.      A sample of 14 subprojects under the ICDP Original Financing showed 8 subprojects
with in-kind and other community contributions. Those ones, totaling around US$0.632 have
aggregated about 21.5% of in-kind contributions on average as a percentage of the overall
budget for Projects. The below table provides examples:

Unit cost analysis

10.     There is international evidence that CDD approaches deliver cost-efficient results
compared to more traditional government programs. For example, the average cost per
kilometer in Morocco for a 6m wide-all weather unpaved road was measured at US$20,112 in
CDD-type implemented subprojects, compared to US$44,150 for the same type of road in
traditional infrastructure projects.6 On the capacity building aspect, however, the World
Bank-carried regional impact evaluations for projects similar to the ICDP, such as the Yemen
Social Fund and confirmed the initial high cost of CDD-related training and capacity building
activities. Although these costs cannot serve as a basis for evaluating the cost-efficiency of
ICDP activities, they provide some comparison on cost per beneficiary for similar types of
activities under ICDP and the Yemen Social Fund for Development Impact Evaluation Study:

11.     Although some statistics on unit costs for ICDP are not available, it is difficult to
compare the unit costs in WBG with those of similar operations in the region. This is
primarily due to the volatile economic environment of WBG.                    In addition, movement
restrictions on people and goods have contributed to excessive inefficiency, scarcity of goods,
and increase in transaction costs, all leading to relatively high prices of raw materials and
other inputs.   The table below provides indicative estimates on average unit costs for
subprojects implemented under ICDP in the West Bank.

12.     Traditional approach to ensure greater cost-efficiency of projects similar to ICDP has
been by establishing ceilings for unit costs. However, given the high fluctuation in prices of
inputs within the Palestinian market in general and between West Bank markets and Gaza
Markets, in particular, it was rather futile to set such a standard for comparison and control. In
addition, such standardadization would have increased the risk of biased allocations to the
"cheaper" sectors that may have little impact in terms of social welfare.

13.     A recent informal survey of contractors in the West Bank and Gaza carried out by the
Municipal Development and Lending Fund under the Bank's Second Emergency Municipal
Services Rehabilitation Project has found increases in the costs of certain infrastructure
materials to be more than 30% in the past 6-8 months. The situation in Gaza in particular is
far more critical than West Bank due to the prolonged border closure and scarcity of raw

                          Annex 5        Beneficiary Survey Results
Beneficiary Impact Assessment March 2008  Executive Summary and Recommendations

Focus of the BIA and Methodology:

In November, 2007, PECDAR signed a contract after a competitive selection process with a
consulting firm  Riyada Consulting and Training Company  to carry out the Beneficiary
Impact Assessment (BIA) for the ICDP, based on sampling of households and microprojects.
The Beneficiary Impact Assessment was released in March 2008. The key focus in the Terms
of Reference (TOR) of this assessment was to assess the socioeconomic impact of the ICDP
on the local communities, by assessing: (i) extent of participation by the local communities in
the various stages of the microprojects' cycle; (ii) satisfaction of beneficiaries from the
implemented microprojects; and (iii) the institutional impact of ICDP on institutions and
Local Government Units (LGUs).

To fulfill the obligations of the assessment, the selected consulting firm has mobilized a team
of 23 persons who used a combination of field work, review of primary project documents
and the progress reports, qualitative and quantitative questionnaires used in the field (with
sample beneficiaries) and used to interview the implementing partners and PECDAR's
Project Management Team and representatives of local government and the directors of the
Multipurpose Community Telecenters (MCTs), focus group discussions and interviews. The
door-to-door survey sample included 300 people, the institutional interviews included 40
persons and the focus groups included 114 persons from different communities. Further
details on the methodology, sampling, and questionnaires are part of the final BIA report on
Project file.

Primary Results:

The BIA confirmed that the ability to continue the ICDP developmental interventions in
crucial life-saving sectors should be commended given the challenging political environment
in the WBG. To have completed 1308 microprojects, and having expanded or committed
most of the obligated funds are impressive and indicative of solid achievements given the
operational context of WBG, which includes: constrained access and mobility, travel
restrictions, border closure, political upheaval and the recent complete closure of Gaza. The
BIA also confirmed that the qualitative and quantitative data illustrate that ICDP was meeting
its Developmental Objective, and that the "high" level of beneficiary satisfaction are
impressive and encouraging. The following are highlights from the BIA:

    -   One beneficiary satisfaction, 79% of beneficiaries expressed their satisfaction with the
        implemented microprojects. The responses per type of activity were equally positive,
        reaching, for example, 94% for the roads microprojects and 92% for the MCTs;
    -   Also, around 92% of sample beneficiaries confirmed that the implemented
        microprojects were responsive to the needs of their communities. Interestingly, the
        interviewed females responded more positively than males on this aspect, with 96% as



8 This was the total number of completed microprojects during the implementation of the BIA.
The final number of completed MPs is 221.



                                               27

       opposed to 88% for males. The ICDP seemed to have performed a little less on
       priorities, as the percentage of people who confirmed that their community priorities
       were met was 78%;

    -  83% of sample beneficiaries confirmed that the implemented microprojects have
       facilitated their access to basic services.

In summary, the BIA concluded that the ICDP has scored very well on beneficiary
satisfaction of the activities and implemented microprojects, but nonetheless, scored low on
the actual level of community participation and involvement in the stages of the
implementation cycles of microprojects (39% of sample beneficiaries confirmed that they
have been involved in community meetings to identify the implemented microproject). A key
finding was that although good efforts have been made to encourage community participation
in needs assessments and microproject identification, there was significant room for
improvement, particularly with respect to female participation.

Lessons Learned and Recommendations:

On deficiencies in community participation, the BIA recommended that more attention should
be paid to consulting with the key stakeholders and primary users of the expected service as a
result of the implemented microproject, prior to design.          The BIA also added that
announcements in the ICDP microproject cycles in the local newspapers should be
complemented by other mechanisms that are more effective in reaching poor and
marginalized communities.

Other BIA recommendations were as follows:

     For future similar projects impact would be maximized if the efforts of the World
       Bank and PECDAR are mainstreamed within the overall developmental initiatives
       together with other donors and organizations  the Palestinian Reform and
       Development Plan (PRDP) could be a starting point;

     Training course for LGUs are effective but should be conducted at the beginning of
       project so beneficiaries can apply their new skills and knowledge immediately;

     Community in-kind contributions to microprojects are an effective way of enhancing
       community ownership and commitment, and should be continued;

     PECDAR contracts with LGUs or local committees should extend management and
       maintenance of the buildings and MCTs for at least one year after project completion,
       to ensure effective use of the allocated resources;

     Payments for job creation activities are not always timely according to partner NGOs
       and beneficiaries; improvement is needed in that area;

     Criteria for job creation excluded students who needed to finance education and
       support their families; exceptions should be made in cases when the father or mother
       is unable to work;

1. Project Background

The integrated Community Development Project (ICDP) is a follow- on project to the
previous CDPs I and II, aimed at improving the quality and availability of basic social and
economic services in poor and marginalized communities through financing investments in
local infrastructure and institutions. ICDP prioritized investments to preserve and extend the
capital stock of infrastructure owned by villages, camps, cooperatives and small
municipalities in regions with the highest incidence of poverty.

A $10 million IDA credit for the ICDP was approved on May 23, 2002 and became effective
in August 23, 2002. An amount of $ 2 million committed by the borrower and $ 8 million in
co- financing was envisaged during appraisal bringing the total project amount (at appraisal)
to $ 20 million. However, additional financing did not materialize by the effectiveness date,
resulting in shrinkage in the scope of the project to fit $ 10 million IDA credit by reducing the
number of micro projects and Information and Telecommunication centers originally
proposed.

In May 2006, The additional grant finance to the ICDP was designed with a total of five
million USD to increase investments in local infrastructure and institutions to improve the
quality and availability of basic social and economic services in poor and marginalized
communities of the West Bank and Gaza (WBG) promoting local economic growth and
employment, and supporting human development and poverty reduction. Additional financing
supported micro projects such as access and connecting roads, rehabilitation or extension of
water supply, schools, and sports facilities for youth, and health clinics. Priority in funding
was given to projects with the highest labor content (not less than 30%) and targeting the most
marginalized communities.

The ICDP was originally scheduled to close on June 30, 2006, but it was extended for an
additional 6 months then extended for another one year until the end of December 2007 in
order to allow the implementation of the additional financing. Another extension for three
additional months was approved by the WB on December 18 2007 extending its closing date
to March 31st 2008.


2. Development Objectives and Design as outlined in the Project Appraisal Document
    of 2002 and Project Paper of 2007


The Development objective of the ICDP was to improve the quality and availability of basic
social and economic services in poor and marginalized communities of the West Bank and
Gaza. This objective was anticipated to be realized through financing investments in local
infrastructure and institutions in the WBG.

Regarding the original fund, 75% of the implemented MPs were awarded to communities
with population less than 5,000; based on PCBS census of 1997. As for the additional fund,
68% of the executed MPs were awarded to communities with population less than 5,000;
based on PCBS estimates of 2005. Both funds had achieved the percentage (60%) required in
the combined key performance indicators of the overall ICDP. The following points should
be noted in parallel to the above:



                                               33

    o The percentages include the MPs which were executed in the refugee camps; the
        population of each camp is above 5,000. This has adversely affected the resulted
        percentages.
    o The percentage in the original fund includes the MPs which were implemented in
        Gaza Strip where most of the communities are with population above 5,000.
    o It's worthy to mention that the percentage in the additional fund is less than the
        original, despite that the call for proposals was applied in the additional fund and an
        evaluation report was issued for this purpose.
    o In the additional fund, the MPs Grants were reallocated to the job Creation activities
        in Gaza Strip with no civil works.

Regarding level of satisfaction, it was found that overall, (79 %) of the stated that they are
satisfied with the projects implemented in their localities, (18 %) were satisfied to a certain
extent and only (3 %) were not satisfied, with any differences according to location or gender,
according to the Beneficiary Impact Assessment (BIA) conducted in February 2008. As the
(BIA) results show, both the qualitative and quantitative findings illustrate, that ICDP is
living up to its key objectives of responding to basic needs and facilitating access to services.
The high levels of beneficiary satisfaction are impressive and encouraging which give a clear
indication that the achievements of the ICDP objective are highly satisfactory.

2.1 Project Original Components

The project as designed in the Project Appraisal Document 2002 (Original Finance) project
Paper of 2006 (Additional Finance) consisted of the following Components:

2.1.1. Community Development Micro projects: This component was designed to provide
grants to LGU's and Farmer Cooperatives to finance a minimum of 150 community
development projects under the original and additional financing. The main sectors of
interventions were Constructions, Water and Sanitation, Health, Education, Roads,
Agriculture9 and provision of essential furniture, goods, training and capacity building of the
targeted communities.

2.1.2.: Community Telecenters : This component was designed only under the Original fund
to provide grants to LGU's of pre-selected 10 communities for the purpose of financing 10
multipurpose Telecenters in these communities.

2.1.3. Project Management Support: This component was designed under both the original
and the additional funds to provide incremental operating costs, equipment, studies needed by
PCDAR, MOLG and DORA for project execution and Management.


Table (1) shows the allocations of the original and additional financing

2.2. Project Actual Components

Despite that the original finance was designed to reach 20 million USD, the actual finance
received by PECDAR was (10) million USD. The decline in the budget did not affect the
nature of the components proposed originally but it affected the scope of work in terms of the
number of Micro projects to be financed and the number of ICT's to be established.
Due to the strict closure imposed on Gaza after the events of June 2007, the PMO at
PECDAR anticipated the impossibility of implementing the planned micro projects under
component (1) of the additional finance in Gaza. The complete closure and restrictions on
movement and goods delivery in and out of Gaza made it impossible for construction
materials to be available for implementing the microprojects within the planned strict time
table. With approval from the WB, the PMO reallocated $ 1.9 million from component (1) of
the additional finance to a new component to finance Emergency Job Creation Activities in
Gaza Strip that doesn't require any construction materials and could be implemented smoothly
with the lack of goods and materials.

2.2.1. Community Development Microprojects: Through this component a total of (142)
micro projects were granted to LGU's, small municipalities, Camps Popular Committees and
farmer's Cooperatives. Sectors of Intervention (civil works) were Constructions, Water and
Sanitation, Health, Education, Roads, Agriculture and provision of essential furniture, goods,
training and capacity building of the targeted communities. Given the vulnerable political and
economical situation and the operational context of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, to have
completed 142 MPs under this component through the civil works sectors of interventions and
having expended about UD$14.9 million are impressive and indicative of achievements.

2.2.2. Job Creation Projects in Gaza:

This Additional component was added during the implementation of the additional finance
were (81) NGO's in Gaza strip were granted funds for the purpose of implementing
emergency job creation projects instead of the community Development MPs at a total

amount of US$ 1.90. The reason behind this change is mentioned in Section 2.2 of this
report. (For more information look at chapter 3 of this report) Twenty three communities in
the Gaza Strip districts covering cities, camps and villages were served by the project (Jabalia
camp, Jabalia city, Beit Hanoun village, Beit Lahia city and Um Nassar village) in North
Gaza district, (Gaza city, Wadi Gaza village and Moghraka village) in Gaza district, (Bureij
camp, Nusairat camp, Maghazi camp, Deir El Balah, Wadi Salka village, Msadar village,
Zawaida village) in Middle Gaza district, (Bani Suhaila village, Abassan Al Kabira village,
Qarara village, Khuza'ah village, Khan younis city, Khan younis camp, Fokhari village) in
Khan younis district and (Rafah camp and the neighborhood areas ) in Rafah district.

2.2.3. Community Telecenters: Through this component (5) Telecenters were established,
furnished and equipped, three in the West bank and 2 in Gaza strip. The total finance of
telecenters is $ 640,661.

2.2.4. Project Management: The PMO unit at PECDAR was responsible for the
implementation of the project. DORA, MLG and MOA were represented in the Technical
Committee. Through this component support was provided to PECDAR, DORA, MLG and
MOA through the provision of goods, consultant services, training and preparation of studies.
The total finance for this component and the previously mentioned component is shown in
table (2).

* The actual finance of the original fund was less than the allocated (US$ 10,000,000)
because of the followings:
- The contract ICDP/WB/014EQ.GZ (supply of Materials needed for maintenance) was
closed at US$ 30,579 instead of US$ 55,319 due to the situation in Gaza and the impossibility
to import the required materials.
- About US$ 18,000 were used to compensate for currency loss between US dollars and
British Pounds during replenishment.

** The actual finance of the Additional Fund is less than the allocated (US$ 5,000,000)
because of the followings:


                                              36

- The contract ICDP/S/223.WB (Establishment of Al Maghal Garden in Aida Camp) was
terminated at US$ 16,745 instead of US$ 89,840 due to unresolved disputes on the ownership
of the piece of land on which the project was intended to be established.
- The CDC allocated budget was not exhausted because the Gaza CDC was not hired and the
WB CDC was hire in the mid of August 2007 and not at the beginning of the project.
- Training courses and workshops for beneficiaries under ICDP/AF was not conducted; on the
job training was executed during the implementation of the ICDP.
- About US$ 26,000 were used to compensate for currency loss between US dollars and
British Pounds during replenishment.

3. Project Achievements and Outputs in Comparison to the Objectives Specified in the
PAD of 2002.

The achievements of the ICDP objective of improving quality and availability of basic social
and economic services in poor and marginalized communities of the WBG was measured
based on the revised combined key performance Indicators of 11/6/2007. In January 2008 a
Beneficiary Impact Assessment (BIA) study was conducted through contracting with an
external consultancy firm (Riyada for Consultation and Training). The main findings of the
BIA11 and PECDAR'S MIS records indicated the following:

3.1. Percentage of MPs awarded to marginalized and poor communities:

    -   (72%) of the MPs was awarded to communities with population less than 5,000. (99)
        Micro projects out of the total (137) MPs excluding the ICT's were awarded to
        communities with population less than 5,00012. Given that considerable allocations
        were granted to refugee camps and 40% of the funds to communities in Gaza Strip,
        with population greater than 5,000, this indicator is considered to be achieved with
        high satisfaction level.

    -   (63%) of the beneficiaries of implemented MPs came from families' earning less than
        2000 NIS per month (Below Poverty line).

3.2. Level of Beneficiary Satisfaction:

    -   (79%) of surveyed beneficiaries stated that they are generally satisfied with the
        projects implemented in their localities. The satisfaction level varied between the
        sectors of intervention with the highest (94%) satisfaction for Roads projects and
        lowest (36%) for Agriculture projects. No significant difference in satisfaction
        between the West Bank and Gaza or between genders.

    -   (92%) of surveyed beneficiaries were satisfied with the MPs in terms of being
        responsive to the needs of their communities, female satisfaction ( 96 %) was higher



11 Riyada Consulting and Training, "Beneficiary Impact Assessment (BIA) of the Integrated
Community Development Project ICDP" March 2008.

12Population estimates were derived from the 1997 PCBS census for the original finance
MP's and from the 2005 PCBS population projections for the additional finance MPs.



                                              37

       than male (88%). In comparison the satisfaction of beneficiaries in terms of MP's
       responsiveness to priorities was lower (78%) but still with a significant percentage.
       Satisfaction with Water and sanitation projects (92%) scored highest followed by
       education projects (84%).

   -    (83%) of the surveyed beneficiaries were satisfied from the projects impact in terms
       of facilitating their access to services such as schools, health services, clean water.

   -   (56%) of the surveyed beneficiaries were satisfied from the projects impact on them in
       terms of saving the cost of service provided by the MPs. Water and sanitation projects
       scored highest followed by Education projects.

   -   (79%) of the surveyed beneficiaries were satisfied form the project in terms of saving
       time and effort with significant difference between the West Bank (73%)and Gaza (
       89%).

   -   In total (28 %) surveyed beneficiaries stated that the implemented MPs contributed to
       improving the level of their income. A significant variation was noticed between the
       West Bank (18 %) and Gaza (42 %). This could be attributed to the inclusion of the
       Job creation component in the additional funding that was implemented only in Gaza.

   -   Only 8% of the surveyed beneficiaries and they are all from the West Bank were not
       satisfied from the MPs in terms of having some negative effect on their community.
       The negative effects they stated were mostly out of the control of the project such as
       the dust and delays caused by closing the roads during works.

   In conclusion, we can say that the beneficiaries' satisfaction with the implemented projects
   significantly exceeded the (60%) percentage set out in the original PAD and the combined
   indicators in all dimensions except for the dimensions of saving costs (56%) and
   improving income of families (28%). This lower satisfaction could be interpreted by the
   fact that the nature of the selected micro projects was mainly aimed at filling the gaps in
   services within the served communities. Filling the gap helped in saving some extra costs
   for the families but it did not tangibly improve the level of their income. This is because
   the projects were implemented during the time when the family income of the Palestinian
   communities was significantly deteriorating. Many other factors like the increase in
   unemployment and poverty rate within the served communities negatively impacted the
   level of tangible economical effects on the community.

4. Outputs by Component

4.1. Output (1) of Component (1):

Increased quality and availability of basic service affected by the MPs in communities
implementing MP's. The following indicators were set in the Original PAD of 2002 and the
combined key indicators of July 2007.

4.1.1 Number of Implemented MPs:

It was anticipated that no less than 150 MPs to be financed under the original and additional
ICDP. Actually total of (142) MPs including the finishing works of ICT's were implemented



                                                38

in the WBG. The Original plan was to implement 167 MPs in WBG, the reduction in the
number of MP's is due to the fact that the cost of financing 25 MPs in Gaza approved by the
WB was reallocated to Job creation at a value of $ 1.9 million. Given the reallocation of US$
1.9 million in Gaza Strip from MPs to JCP, the quality and availability of basic services
affected by MPs in the benefiting communities have been satisfactorily increased. (Look at
chapter 3 for more information about factors affecting the number of implemented MPs).

The MPs distribution among the six sectors of intervention as identified in the PAD of 2002
and PAP 2006 is detailed in table (3).

4.1.2 Percentage of in-kind or cash Contribution:

The requirement for obligatory cash community contribution in the original finance was
not emphasized due to the deteriorating financial and economical situation of the
Palestinian communities and LGU's caused by the onset of the second Intifada.

Despite that cash contribution was not considered a condition for receiving finance, the
MIS records of PMO shows that most of the implemented projects had an in-kind
community contribution. This contribution mainly took the form of providing the design
and daily supervision over the project during implementation through the LGU's and
Agricultural cooperatives.

The BIA results revealed that at the beneficiary level, the in-kind contribution within the
surveyed sample was higher in the West Bank (33%) than in Gaza (15%). The
contribution in Water projects scored the highest among the sectors of intervention (67%)
followed by Agriculture (55%) then Education (50%). However, due to the economical
situation of the Palestinians, no records have been documents regarding the cash
contribution; accordingly the rating for the contribution performance indicator is
Unsatisfactory.

4.1.3. Satisfaction with training results:

The total commitment under this category is US$ 142,777.64 and the total disbursed is
US$ 142,777.64. Studies, Consultants Services, Design and preparation of tender
documents, Seminars, training courses in addition to salaries for Community
Development Consultant CDC in the West Bank had been disbursed under this category.

Two training sessions had been conducted under this category for the benefit of the LGUs
members and other local community members; one session was conducted in the West
Bank (Ramallah) and the other was in Gaza Strip. These courses targeted the village
council members (LGUs members), members of refugee camps and public committees,
farmers in agricultural cooperatives, ICDP Technical Committee (TC) (MOA, MLG,
DORA, and PECDAR) in addition to other staff in related ministries and benefited
community members. Each session consisted of different topics related to the ICDP
activities; the following table shows the courses and topics that had been conducted under
this category, dates and cost of the courses:

The training courses which targeted the beneficiaries focused on topics related to Micro
Projects implementation such as introduction to the ICDP, Community Based
Procurement and Procurement Management (content of the procurement documents and
its priorities, evaluation of the bids, prequalification of contractors ...etc), Project
Management, Financial Management, Banking and Projects Project (the role of the banks
in financing micro-projects issues concerning checks, guarantees, insurance, invoices,
taxes.....etc.), Identification and Planning for Local Development in addition to other
supportive topics such as computer literacy for LGUs members and advanced computer
topics. According to the course evaluation that was conducted at the end of each training
session the beneficiaries indicated that the training was very useful to improve planning
and consultation and management capacities of communities. The training session had
very significant impacts on the beneficiaries in terms of empowerment of poor and
marginalized LGU's by training the members of the village councils to enable them to
manage their projects by themselves. It is also worth noting that the capacity building to
LGUs was done during the original fund by conducting training sessions, while in
Additional Fund and due to time constraints, training was done through the on the job
training practices; procurement, preparation of tender document and supervision
supported by PECDAR's staff. However, it was difficult to assess the impact of the
training courses during the impact assessment conducted by the hired consultant (Riyada)
due to change of councils and lack of mechanisms to ensure transfer of knowledge and
documentation within the local government system, according to the BIA study
conducted in February 2008. Sustaining skills and capacity building interventions within
LGUs is most difficult due to two main reasons; the first is that they change over time
and second there are no mechanisms in place to ensure transfer of knowledge and
documentation within the LGUs from old to new councils.

Other activities had been conducted under this category such as the salaries of the
CDC in the West Bank at US$ 52,350, Consultancy services and Design for some
projects such as the Animal Quarantine Station in Jericho, consultancy Services for the
Design and preparation of tender document for some micro projects, Production of a
Documentary Film about the ICDP, Consultancy Services for the provisions of Social,
Technical and Environmental Assessment for 18 Micro Projects implemented under the
ICDP for the Mid Term Review in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and consultancy
Services for the Provisions of Social Appraisal for seven Projects in Gaza Strip.

1.4. Serving more than one community:

It was anticipated that not less than (30%) of the implemented MPs serve more than one
community. Actually, (99) implemented MP's out of a total of (142) were awarded to
projects serving more than one community yielding a (73%) percentage. The rating for
this indicator is Satisfactory.

4.1.5. Serving Youth and Women

The anticipated key performance indicator for serving Youth and women is 30% of the
implemented MPs in the Additional Fund. A total of (22) executed MPS out of the 40



                                            42

MPs directly served women and youth through either the education sector or public
building by supporting and rehabilitation of girl's schools or directly by supporting the
construction and rehabilitation of youth centers and women centers. The following are a
classification of the executed projects that serve the Youth and Women under the
Additional Fund with a percentage of 55% exceeding the anticipated percentage included
in the combined PMI (30%):




       Classification           Number of Executed MPs                 Notes
Girls Schools                  9 MPs                       Girls schools
Boys Schools                   3 MPs                       Boys Schools
Mixed Schools                  4 MPs                       Coeducational Schools
Women Centers                  3 MPs                       Center      for      Women
                                                           Activities
Other Youth Projects           2 MPs                       Such as children parks
Infrastructure      serving 1 MP                           A road for girls school
Youth & Women Projects
Total                          22

On the other hand, the remaining executed MPs are serving other infrastructure sectors of
interventions such as roads, water and health projects that also serve Women and Youth
in addition to other community components. Accordingly this indicator was achieved on
Highly Satisfactory Level.

4.1.6. Physical Achievements and Outputs:

Since the launching of the ICDP MPs in 2003, the implementation of the projects went
smoothly despite the vulnerable political situation and the unstable security situation in
the Palestinian Territories. Until the date of this report, about 142 community
development MPs in Civil Works infrastructure had been implemented in the West
Bank and Gaza strip benefiting more than 200 different communities. These community
development MPs included civil works for construction, extension or rehabilitation of
water supply, sanitation, health clinics, schools, roads, water wells, irrigation networks
and other agricultural facilities.

Despite the deteriorating political and economical status of the Palestinians, the
achievements of the ICDP projects way exceeded its anticipations achieving (80 %)
beneficiary satisfaction levels and more, according to the BIA conducted by Riyada
Consultants. The direct impact of the implemented projects included both rehabilitation
of community infrastructure, creating temporary local jobs during adverse and difficult
political and economic conditions and the majority of the implemented projects resulted
in access to permanent services and access to education, health, local council services and
community multipurpose centres (ICTs). These are considered solid achievements and
were highly appreciated by the majority of beneficiaries (92 %) who stated that the



                                            43

implemented projects have directly responded to their needs The ICDP projects have
positively contributed to facilitating access to services and interestingly female
respondents (86 %) scored higher satisfaction than males (81 %) as any facilitation of
access and mobility directly affects women and children who usually have less mobility.
Similarly, female respondents clearly stated more satisfaction with the projects for saving
time and effort (83 %) compared to males (75 %). Some of the examples on the physical
achievements below put emphases on the fact that the ICDP achievements were
significant and highly satisfactory.

 For example in the field of Roads projects, many villages were without any access to the
 nearby city or did not have any accessibility to the main road or did not have a paved
 entrance or have dead ends. Al Janieh Village is an example of a poor community with a
 population of about 1100 inhabitants used to go through very dirty unpaved access road
 in order to reach the surrounding villages or other communities; with US$56k a linking
 road was recently paved and rehabilitated bringing life and mobility to Al Janieh
 community and easing their daily lives. Other villages were without paved internal roads
 which made accessibility to the vital services such as schools, village council, health
 centers, mosques and markets hazardous. In the west Bank about 32 villages were
 connected by linking roads through the execution of 14 MPs, entrances of other three
 villages were connected with the main road facilitating the mobility of the local
 communities out of and into these villages. The roads projects improved and facilitated
 the life of the inhabitants in terms of facilitating and strengthening the social life and
 bonds between the people of the different villages and promoting coordination and
 cooperation between the public service providers in these villages. The pavement and
 rehabilitation of the internal and linking roads relieved part of the economic burdens on
 the families by reducing the cost of transportation and maintenance of vehicles. In
 regards to the health and environmental aspects, these projects had a significant impact
 on improving the health status and promoting a healthier environment in the targeted
 regions, where dust was reduced to significant levels and accessibility to health facilities
 in case of emergencies is facilitated and became faster. In total about 78 Km of
 different types of roads have been constructed and rehabilitated in West Bank and Gaza
 Strip until the end of March 2008, this is in addition to 14 Km of agricultural roads.

 In the field of Education projects about 157 classrooms were constructed, 35
 classrooms were finished, maintained or rehabilitated benefiting more than 40
 communities in the West Bank and Gaza Strip The 157 classrooms helped relief many
 social and educational issues in the benefiting communities; it increased the accessibility
 to high school education and decreased the drop out after the 10th grade, especially
 between females, by upgrading the schools to the 12th grade (Tawjihi) such as in Deir Al
 Sudan, Raba, Biet Duqqo, Mikhmas, Farkha, Al Nabi Saleh, Deir Ammar, Marah
 Rabah and other Villages. In addition to that, addition of classrooms and upgrading of
 schools helped reduce the cost of travel and transportation to high schools in the nearby
 villages and cities which relief some of the economic burdens on families.

In the field of Water projects, the ICDP also helped several communities overcome the
problem of water shortage. A considerable portion of the LGUs in the West Bank do not



                                              44

have a source for drinking water, water networks, or water reservoirs, this causes
substantial problems in terms of health, environmental, social and economical aspects.
Four water reservoirs were constructed through the ICDP in four different villages to
solve the problem of water shortage caused by fluctuation of water supply by the supplier
company. The reservoirs helped the village councils provide the houses with tap water at
steady state conditions. For example, before the construction of Bidia Water Reservoir,
the 6,000 inhabitants of the village used to wait days and some times weeks for the
supplier company to provide them with water especially in summer seasons. Recently and
thanks to the ICDP supported project of building the water reservoir in the village, the
reservoir stores sufficient quantity of water for several days; houses are supplied with
sufficient quantities of water based on three days weekly scheduled pumping. Water
networks also helped provide all the houses of Al Fundok and Jayyous village with
water, the inhabitants of many locations within the villages used to use kitchen utensils to
provide their families with drinking water. On the other hand through this category,
several LGUs were provided with electric transmitters and other electricity materials such
as Al Simia area within Al Samou' municipality jurisdiction, located south to Hebron
District which is considered one of the poorest areas in the West Bank. In the past, Al
Simia inhabitants used to have a fluctuated and very weak electric current which caused
about 4,000 people to suffer from this problem; students, doctors, housewives, small
industries, farms and others used to complain continuously. Recently the inhabitants of Al
Simia area are provided with stable electric current generated by local generators after
purchasing a transmitter and other electric materials at US$49,402 which solved the roots
of the problem; improved life quality, enhanced the educational environment, and
improved their economy. Ein Sinia Village and the other nearby villages used to suffer
from an environmental and health hazard caused by sewage and wastewater pools that
converges at the agricultural lands surrounding the houses of Ein Sinia, Jifna, Ber Zeit and
Dura Al Qare' villages. A main sewer line was constructed to divert the wastewater away
into the proposed treatment plan area, which mitigated the environmental hazardous
effects of the raw sewage on the surrounding agricultural land and people. The ICDP also
helped enhance the agricultural economy in some aspects. Agricultural manufacturing
equipment have been imported and installed to improve the production of agricultural
industries owned by public agricultural cooperatives. These projects, in addition to
veterinary labs, agricultural training center and agricultural roads had significant impacts
on agriculture in particular and on economy in general.


 In regards to the Goods, PECDAR has received many applications and requests from the
 LGUs and camps seeking for funds to supply them with office equipment such as
 computers, printers, photocopiers and fax machines. Between the years 2005 and 2008,
 PECDAR has provided most of the village councils and camps in the West Bank with
 575 personal computers, 355 laser printers, 120 fax machines and 130 photocopiers
 and 11 LCD projectors. A random quick assessment was carried by PECDAR's site
 engineers in terms of proper usage of the supplied equipment shows that the equipment
 supplies had achieved their goals. It was observed that the supplied office equipment
 improved the beneficiaries (LGUs and Camps) management skills and administrative
 capacities especially in project management, project accounting, bills management,
 project monitoring, correspondence and proposal writing capabilities for fund raising and



                                              45

other purposes. In the same context, computers, printers, photocopiers were also
delivered to MOLG and DORA for the sake of building up the capacity building of the
ICDP partners.

As for Gaza Strip, the same types and quality of micro projects have been implemented
in Gaza Strip under the original fund in education, roads, services buildings, agriculture,
sanitation and electricity. Projects implemented in Gaza Strip also had significant positive
impacts on the local communities. One of the pioneer projects was the construction of a
veterinary lab in Gaza City at US$ 89,679. Recently, the lab is working at high
efficiency and the farmers had found positive changes in the quality of services provided
by the lab as compared with the situation before. Significant positive impacts on the
public health of Gaza Strip inhabitants and enhancement in the economy of the benefited
farmers are really basic reasons for considering the project as one of the successful
stories of the ICDP. In regards to the Goods purchased in Gaza Strip, 148 computers, 63
laser printers, 26 photocopiers and 7 faxes were purchased for the benefit of about 25
different local governmental municipalities, refugee camps, farmers cooperatives,
schools, LGUs, youth and women centers and clubs. Purchasing the computers and other
office equipment clearly had the following impact on the final beneficiaries:

1. Enhancement of the capacity of the LGUs, camps, MOLG staff, MOA staff, DORA
staff and other local government units in terms of management.

2. Improvement the skills of the LGUs technical and administrative staff.

3. Improvement in the accounting systems, bills management, project monitoring and
correspondence.

4. Purchasing electric transmitters, generators, cables and street lighting units helped
maintain the existing electrical lighting and electrical networks, improved the social life
of benefited communities, improved economy and facilitated their life in many aspects.

Medical equipment such as emergency beds and emergency trolleys, DC shocker with
monitor in addition to Radiographic Devices have been purchased which helped relief the
pressure on emergency units in some hospitals in the Gaza Strip.

In order to keep Gaza Strip clean, 25 different municipalities, camps and LGUs had
benefited from the ICDP by purchasing sweeping tools and streets cleaning equipment at
a total amount of US$74,019. This is also considered the door steps for any future Job
Creation Project and will encourage donors to pledge their donations in this field
especially in the current vulnerable economic situation of the Strip.

4.1.7. Labor Content of MPs:

The following table shows the labor content of the MPs implemented under the original
and additional finance of the ICDP:

     ICDP Finance                            Manpower/Day         Labor      content
                                                                  %13
     Original finance MPs                    102,737              26 %

     Additional finance MPs                  39,54214             28.3 %
     Total                                   138,737

The labor content percentage is below the planned 30%. This lower percentage is
justified by the following:
     The labor content estimates included only the direct labor, the indirect labor such
        as managers, accountants, drivers, cement factories workers etc....who indirectly
        benefited from the implemented projects with not less than (1520 %) of the
        direct labor, is not taken into consideration .
     The estimate did not include the Job Creation Projects in Gaza that is presented
        separately in section 2.4.3.
     A considerable portion of MPs were allocated to the implementation of roads
        projects, water and sanitation with the nature of low labor contents.

4.2. Output (2) of Component (1): Strengthened relationship between local councils and
their constituents in communities implementing MPs.

The results of the BIA 2008 revealed that in total the beneficiaries believe that the
implemented MPs improved their relationship with the local council. The highest impact
on strengthening the relationship was gained through implementing buildings projects
(98%) and the least was through implementing roads projects (32%). The utilizations of
the buildings by the village councils directly impacted the relationship between them and
their constituents where these buildings contributed to improve accessibility to public
services and increased personal contact between the council members and the
beneficiaries.

The degree of satisfaction with the level of community participation was proposed in the
PAD of 2002, to be used as an indicator for measuring the impact of the implemented
MPs on strengthening the relationship between the local councils and their constituents.
A minimum of 60% beneficiary satisfaction with the level of community participation



13Calculated on the basis of an average wage of $20 per day

14As by the end of March 2008



                                              48

was anticipated to be obtained from beneficiaries after the completion of the ICDP
Microprojects.

The level of community participation was emphasized in the additional finance through
the requirement of providing signed public meeting minutes in which the community
participated in selecting the proposed project as a priority need for funding. Despite that
the additional fund took the community participation as one of the major criteria of
selection of the proposed MPs and all the selected MPs provided the required prove and
document for community participation, the BIA study conducted by Riyada Consultancy
in February 2008 revealed that the community Participation is much lower (39%) than
beneficiary satisfaction with the implemented projects (79%). The Participation was
higher in the West Bank (29%) than Gaza Strip (22%) with significant difference
between males (34%) and females (18%). Comparing these results with the results of
Ma'alem Consultancy BIA study conducted in July 2005 for assessing the socio
economic impact of the original finance in which the followings were revealed:15

   o 61% of the surveyed beneficiaries believe that the participation of community in
       identification of    the community needs and participating in planning and
       implementing the projects are considered the most important steps in community
       development

   o About two third of the local communities surveyed perceived that their councils
       seriously consider the principle of realizing the desires of the society

   o Most of the surveyed beneficiaries           believe that the community members
       participating in one way or another in preparing and planning the project while
       less than one third think that only the council members who arrange and plan for
       the projects without any consultation with the community

   o 38% of the local community councils benefited from the experience of the
       community members, while about 35% depended on the plans of the council
       without any help from their communities. On the other hand, 26% of the councils
       got help from the experience and the skills of people outside their communities.

In conclusion we can say that despite that the beneficiaries' belief and good awareness of
the importance of their participation in the different phases of project identification and
management (61%), this awareness and belief was not completely translated into actions
during the different phases of micro project management (39%).

4.3. Output of the new Component; Creating Emergency Job Opportunities for the
unemployed in Gaza Strip (JCP):

Under this component a total of (81) Nongovernmental Organizations in Gaza Strip were
awarded funds to support emergency job creation projects with a total allocation of
$1,898,987.97. The projects directly benefited 5,295 beneficiaries (workers) from 23
communities in Gaza City, North Gaza, Middle Gaza, Khan Younis and Rafah through
the creation of 170,000 man workdays, 95% labor content.

BIA results revealed that the Job creation component of the ICDP had a positive impact
on its beneficiaries and the communities in which it was implemented. The Impact of the
JC projects on the beneficiaries as stated by the beneficiaries themselves through the
focus groups are summarized in the following points:

    o Temporary improving the income of families by receiving temporary wages ($300
        $ 400) for 2.5 months.
    o Learning new skills that promoted some women to start their own home based
       projects for producing some home made products.
    o Some of the beneficiaries received permanent job offers from the organizations
       that employed them.
    o Receiving the psychological support from the peer workers especially during the
       difficult and stressful time during which the projects were implemented.

4.4 Outputs of Component (2); establishing community telecommunication centers
ICTs:

This component has financed 5 multipurpose community telecenters in pre selected
communities of WBG, through grants provided to LGUs. Each telecenter micro project
had provided funding for:

(i) Civil Works for extend or reconfigure facilities to accommodate ICT infrastructure
and programs; (ii) goods, such as computers, software, furniture, phones, fax machines,
photocopiers, including connection to Internet services; and (iii) specialist services for
delivery of programs and services for up to 18 months.

The main objective of the (ICT) is to develop sustainable, replicable models of multi-
purpose community Tele-centers in WBG and to evaluate the impact of such centers on
social, economic and cultural development. These Tele-centers address the issue of
economic and human resource constrains for the access to ICT in poor rural and urban
areas through the provision of public access points for such technology and services. In
general, the following services are the most common services being provided by the five
ICTs:

    o Provide general services in the field of Information and Communication
       Technology;
    o Train the community on informatics techniques in order to obtain information and
       assistance from many educational and technical sources and researches for
       different strata of the community such as farmers, physicians, engineers,



                                            50

       students...etc. in their specialty in order to enhance and improve their capacities
       in their fields. This is done through training the community on how to use internet
       and search engines;
    o Provide internet services;
    o Perform periodic surveys to assist the training needs of the community;
    o Conduct and supervise training courses, seminars and workshops;
    o Generate and provide Digital Library;
    o Provide the surrounding communities with urgent office supports and services
       such as printing, copying, faxing, emailing, scanning and other services;
    o Provide advanced Telecommunication technology services.

4.4.1 Number of f ICTs established and beneficiary satisfaction with its impact.

Total of (5) ICTs were established, three in the West Bank located in Salfeet, Azzoun and
Ithna, and two in Gaza Strip located in Big Abassan and Beit Lahia. The location for each
ICT was pre selected by the ICDP Steering Committee in close cooperation and approval
of the WB such that the anticipated number of benefiting communities is maximized.
Two employees were hired for each ICT; a Manager and an Assistant for each, in order to
run and manage the ICT activities. All the necessary items required for the ICTs to start
their activities such as finishing works of the building, furniture, computers, servers,
printers, photocopiers, electric equipment, stationary, internet and other requirements
have been supplied and installed for each center. A business plan was assigned fore each
center including the promotion plan, financial strategy, accounting system and
management system to assist the manager and the assistant operate the center properly.
The total finances extended for the establishment, furnishing and operating of the 5 ICTs
was about $ 642,000.

The results of the BIA revealed high general satisfaction (92%) with the projects which is
an impressive success. The satisfaction level with the ICTs as being able to respond to
community needs and providing a new service that did not exist before was also
significant (89%). The level of satisfaction differed between males (94%) and females
(82 %) which indicate difference in the utilization of the ICTs by genders. This difference
could be explained with the cultural believes and attitudes prevailing within the targeted
communities that gives males higher freedom of movement and accessibility to such
services.

The establishment of the ICTs was confronted with the main problem which is the very
bad economic situation of the Palestinian citizens which makes them unenthusiastic and
hesitated in making registration in the centers, either registration for training courses or
internet services, in addition to this, the ADSL is provided by PALTEL Company for
almost all the customers. The promotion plan for each ICT partially resolved these issues,
other ways to resolve these issues were by contacting the local NGOs to finance free
training courses and seminars to encourage the communities to attend such courses.

The sustainability of the ICTs depends on three key factors:




                                             51

   1. income from services
   2. support from municipalities
   3. Income generated by conducting training courses, seminars and workshops

A cost recovery business model was designed for the three ICT centers. This model
allows for self dependence in 3-5 years period with full support from ICDP in the first 18
months and with a partial support for the hosting municipalities in Salfeet, Azzoun and
Ithna. After the first five years, the centers are expected to cover all their expenses.

Another element of sustainability that was designed in the centers is the introduction of a
wide range of services provided in each center such as high speed internet, printing,
typing, photocopying and training. This allows for more customers to benefit from these
services as well to generate more income to the centers.
 As for Salfeet ICT center (Siraj), it started operating on July 14, 2004 and till now
   enjoys a good level of services to the community primarily due to the continuous
   support of the municipality and the network it built with many local and international
   organizations. The salaries of the manager and the secretary are paid directly by the
   municipality and the income from the services it provides (around $800) covers of the
   other expenses such as internet cost, stationary and miscellaneous costs. It should be
   mentioned here that Salfeet Municipality had undertaken to pay the salaries of the
   employees if any revenue shortage occurs. The center was successful in establishing a
   solid network with local and international organizations such as the National Institute
   of Technology, Civic Forum, Sharaek Youth forum and Heins DSS, which funded 30
   workshops and donated LCDs and computers to the center. Now the center managed
   to increase its LCDs to 4, 2 new Laser color printers and added 5 more computers to
   its lab.
 As for ICT Azzoun (Al Rafed), the center started offering services on March 15, 207.
   The ICDP covered the running cost till December 31, 2007. The center provides all
   services such internet, research and training in the field of Hebrew language, high
   school curriculum, and computer training. The center was successful in signing a deal
   with the union of teachers for the purpose training all teachers in the field of
   computer literacy. The municipality pays the salaries of the manager and the secretary
   and this is very helpful in the sustainability of the center especially in the first three
   months of the 2008 when the town was under extended curfews by the Israeli
   authorities and the center did not generate enough income to pay for its expenses.
   Customers to use the internet in this center are limited due to the fact that 60% of the
   houses are connected to the internet through ADSL.
 In regards to ICT Ithna (Al Mustakbal), the center started operating on April 26, 2007
   and currently employs a manager and a secretary and offers internet services for NIS
   3 an hour as well as training in areas such as Excel, MS Office and other services.
   The majority of the beneficiaries are women (70%) as they feel that it is a trusted
   place to visit given the big number of Internet Cafs in the areas which are usually
   used by men. The current income of the center does not exceed $600 per months,
   whereas the monthly expenditures are around $1500. The difference is being paid by
   the municipality and this is a great element for the sustainability of the center.

 Abassan Al Kabira ICT, was officially opened in mid of the year 2005. The center
   provides its services for the communities of Abassan Al Kabira, Abassan Al village,
   Khuza'ah, Bani Suhaila and Khan younis (city & camp). The running expenses were
   covered from the ICDP budget until Dec. 31, 2006. Abassan Al Kabira center is now
   sustainable and its operating expenses are covered both from its own revenues and
   municipality budget. In general, Abassan Al Kabira ICT provides the following
   services:
   o Provide general services in the field of Information and Communication
       Technology.
   o Make Membership systems in the services of the Abassan Al Kabira ICT
   o Perform cyclical surveys to understand the IT training needs.
   o Implement and direct the implementations of the training courses plans, and make
       teaching materials and resources.
   o Train people to utilize the computer skills, programs and systems, and how to
       manage an organizational information and offices applications, Conduct general
       training courses like (Microsoft Office programs, Internet, etc), and professional
       (for computer specialists) training courses like (MCSE, MCSD, ORACLE,
       ASP.NET, etc).
   o Provide informatics techniques, and many of educational and technical sources
       and researches for different students' levels, individuals, and companies.
   o Present Internet and Web services to people.
   o Provide Digital Library.
   o Support residing students by providing information resources.
   o Provide Khan Younis governorate and Abasan Al-Kabira residents by office
       services like Documents' Printing, Copying, and Scanning.
   o Provide advanced Telecommunication technology service.

After the end of the ICDP support, the Abassan Al Kabira ICT is still operating and show
reasonably good signs of achieving financial sustainability. Income for services,
however, covers no more than about half the total costs of operating the Abassan Al
Kabira ICT.
Interestingly, the Municipality has proved willing to pick up the rest of the costs. And
some have been remarkably successful in obtaining funds for their own projects
involving the Abassan Al Kabira ICT operators and services.
See the attached excel sheet (ICT Abassan revenues) ( for the period in charge by the
municipality, from 01/01/2007 to 31/12/2007)

 Beit Lahia ICT became active on Aug. 1, 2006 in order to provide and disseminate
   information and statistics needed for all segments of community citizens, on the other
   hand to enhance the community information technology capabilities, and provide a
   distinctive and creative combine to provide service and technical support. The
   running expenses were covered from the ICDP budget until Dec. 31, 2007. Beit Lahia
   center is now sustainable and its running operating expenses are covered both from its
   own revenues and municipality budget. The center has launched several training
   courses for community development and the development of citizens in the use of
   information technology; Win XP and internet, Excel, Golden "assil" for accounting,



                                            53

   Design web site by PHP language and other courses. The center was successful in
   establishing networks with some donors, NGOs and other institutions, such as the
   Italian Cooperative Corporation COOPI.

The above successes of the ICT centers were slightly undermined with the experience of
Ithna ICT center. After the center was built, fully furnished and operated for 12 months
by the ICDP project and immediately after the end of the contract on December 31, 2007,
the equipment was moved by the local council to another location for utilizing the
building for other purposes. A mission from the WB and PECDAR has visited the
original and the new locations of the center, the equipment were moved to the new
building which is rented by the municipality in the center of Ithna town. The center will
continue providing its services in the new location.

  5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

  5.1 Factors outside PECDAR's Control:

 The instability of the Political and security situation in the West Bank and Gaza
  Strip:

  The Original Fund of the ICDP was brought into effectiveness in August 2002, where the
  situation in the Palestinian Territories was very critical and vulnerable.

  During the period from August 2002 till mid 2005, the beginning of the project marked
  the worst political situation and incursions and extreme closure measures, of all
  Palestinian Territories particularly in the West Bank. The West Bank was separated into
  three areas, and it was impossible for any one who lives in one area to move to another.
  Contractors and their staff were confronted with very hard difficulties to collect the
  bidding documents, to attend the pre  tender meetings, to issue the required securities
  and guarantees, to submit their bids on time, to sign their contracts, to issue the necessary
  insurance, and to reach their projects sites during the implementation phase. Very
  complicated procedures were also imposed on the mobility of the construction materials
  which resulted in lack of construction materials and sometime it was out of market.
  PECDAR engineers could not reach their offices for a long period. This situation resulted
  in significant progress delays of the projects, and negatively affected the ICDP progress.
  Several updating of the work plan were issued in order to keep the ICDP framework and
  preserve its objectives.

  The instability of the political and security situation resulted in further deterioration and
  destruction of infrastructure. This caused additional burdens in addition to the delays of
  implementation. PECDAR had to take additional measures of opening five more offices
  in Tulkarem, Jenin, Qalqilia, Jericho and Bethlehem besides the original four offices in
  Al Ram, Hebron, Nablus and Gaza to enable the contractors collect the bidding
  documents, to submit their bids on time, and to facilitate the implementation of works.
  This had added an additional administrative burden, but was a necessary measure to
  ensure close follow up in procuring the works / goods / consultancy services and in
  supervising the implementation of the ICDP projects, as in many cases, engineers and
  projects supervisors were not able to reach project sites.

  After 2005, the situation in the West Bank as a whole became less difficult than in Gaza
  Strip. In Gaza, due to successive closures of boarders, and in addition to separating the
  strip into three areas, the most difficult problem that faced the implementation of the
  ICDP was importing the construction materials and other supplies. In this case the
  construction materials, which are mainly imported from Israel and from the European
  Union, could not reach the contractors and accordingly the progress of the ICDP was
  severely affected by this obstacle.

  The changing political environment including the recent developments in Gaza was
  another obstacle faced the ICDP implementation. This had implications on the project



                                               55

  and resulted in changing the ICDP work plan several times particularly for GAZA
  components. Several proposals were suggested by PECDAR in close cooperation with
  the WB mission to over come the new situation in GAZA. By replacing the micro
  projects component by a new component; Job Creation, as an alternative to construction
  since materials were not permitted to enter Gaza, made it possible for PECDAR to
  complete this component.

 The short implementation period of the Additional Fund:

  Given the very tight implementation time frame of the AF, PECDAR and the Bank have
  taken many precautions to eliminate the risk of not completing the MPs within the tight
  implementation period; such as selecting MPs with ready documents and starting
  informing the communities on the community procurement procedures and preparations
  for procurement. Despite these precautions, the implementation of the ICDP, particularly
  the Additional Fund was confronted with a very high risk of not completing some of the
  MPs; this risk was due to the following challenges in regards to the implementation
  period:

  1. The procurement manual of the original fund modified by PECDAR to be applied to
      the additional fund was accepted in principle by the Bank. The Bank demanded that
      the manual should be changed by an individual consultant such that it completely
      goes along with one of the project key features; which is the "Community Driven
      Development Project (CDD)". However, this feature was achieved; the procurement
      procedures went through the beneficiaries with close cooperation and assistance of
      PECDAR's staff.

  2. The absence of simplified bidding documents in the Arabic language within the West
      Bank & Gaza strip forced PECDAR to look for these documents in the neighborhood
      countries and to try to consult regional consultants. After long efforts from PECDAR,
      the translation of these documents was the only choice in order to make them
      available in the hands of the LGUs staff.

  3. The low capacity of some LGUs, that requires investing more time and efforts by
      PECDAR staff on the on- job training particularly in Documents preparations,
      Community Driven Procurement, Project Management, supervision... etc.

  4. Working hours during Ramadan are usually less than the regular daily working hours
      which had an adverse impact on the implementation period

  5. The implementation of some of the projects, especially the infrastructure projects,
      coincided with the winter season and holiday's season which hindered their progress.

 The low capacity of the beneficiaries and LGUs:

  One of the most challenges and obstacles that were faced is the very low capacity of the
  LGUs and other beneficiaries, especially the poor and marginalized communities. In



                                               56

addition, the MPs cycle was short and the type of procurement depended on the capacity
of the beneficiary (Community Procurement). This caused delays not only to the
procurement processes, but also during the review of the technical documents such as
design, plans, quantities and specifications because of the low quality of submitted
documents, demanded intensive efforts from PECDAR especially during review and
procurement processes. It is worth noting that most of capacity building to LGUs was
done during the implementation of the fund and on the job training. Prior training
sessions have been conducted for the benefit of the LGUs who had benefited from the
original fund. As for the additional fund, and because of the short period of
implementation, on the job training was very useful for improving the capacity of the
beneficiaries.

 Financial Management issues:

Two main financial obstacles were encountered during the implementation:

-      Fluctuation of the currency exchange rates and successive changes in Market
prices:

As the Palestinian Territories is a special case in dealing with different currencies, this
issue has adversely affected the implementation from two aspects:

(1) The overall allocated budget of the ICDP is in US Dollars, since contracts with
contractors and suppliers are in US Dollars, the contractors were paid in the Dollar
currency while disbursements were in Sterling Pounds and were recorded equivalent to
US Dollars. The differences in exchange rates resulted in deficiencies between the
Bank's records and what actually was paid by PECDAR. The value of the deficiencies
was US$ 26,421 in the Additional Fund and about US$ 18,000 in the Original as
recorded on March 31, 2008. These values are expected to increase by the end of the
Grace Period (July 31, 2008).

(2) Since the ICDP contracts were signed in US Dollars currency, while the contractors
pay for construction materials and labor in NIS, most of the contractors lost a large
margin of their profits or even did not meet their break even as the rate of change of the
US Dollar dropped significantly during the implementation period. During September
2007, the average rate of change of the Dollar against NIS was around 4.04 NIS per one
dollar; during March 2008 it dropped down to 3.45 NIS per one Dollar. This has
adversely affected the performance of contractors.

Another problem encountered during the implementation of the ICDP was the fluctuation
and instability of prices of the supplied goods and materials such as computers, printers,
fax machines and photocopiers. This price fluctuation made it so difficult for PECDAR to
design a realistic plan to utilize the remaining budget under the Goods Category.
Unforeseen savings were always experienced between the estimated bids and the lowest
bidder's prices. This resulted in accumulation of savings in this category allover the ICDP
implementation period.

  -       Initial Deposit and the long replenishment life cycle:

  Given the emergency nature of the ICDP, the value of advance payments is considered
  below the amount of submitted invoices within the short implementation period of the
  AF; the advance installment of the AF was not sufficient to meet the submitted invoices.
  Furthermore, due to the fact that the implementation of the AF was confronted with
  holiday season, replenishment periods (life cycle) were too long (one month for some
  cases) and did not meet the project objectives and nature. Adding to this issue the drop in
  Dollar resulted in a major obstacle which adversely affected the performance of the
  contractors and delayed progress.

 Complete closure of Gaza Strip:

  Currently, the situation in Gaza Strip is much worse than the past four years, given the
  on-going freeze on passage of goods and supplies into Gaza and the reluctance of
  contractors to apply for bids, except for medical supplies, the goods supplies were
  confronted with significant delays. One supply contract was terminated because the
  supplier could import the all the items in accordance with the contract;
  ICDP/WB/095EQ.GZ was terminated at US$ 30,579 instead of US$ 55,319 which
  resulted in not committing all the allocated budget of the original fund. Other contracts
  (Construction and supplies) in Gaza caused significant delays to the whole fund due to
  the impossibility to be finished in the specified anticipated timeframe.

  In addition to that, most of the proposed MPs in Gaza, under the additional fund, were
  infrastructure in nature and it was difficult to be implemented given the current freeze on
  passage of goods into Gaza. In order to address these challenges facing project
  implementation in Gaza, the allocations for Gaza Strip had been used in Job Creation
  Projects (JCP) rather infrastructure. The quick response of PECDAR and the flexibility of
  the World Bank made it possible to overcome this issue by enabling PECDAR to utilize
  all the funds allocated for Gaza Strip in Employment Generation and Job Creation
  Activities (JCP) which was implemented 81 NGOs within Gaza Strip. The works did not
  include any construction materials or any material needed to be imported from outside
  Gaza Strip.

 The long preparation period of the Additional Fund:

  The additional fund of the ICDP is a Community Development Driven (CDD) Project
  required specific preparation as it was a unique experience. Although PECDAR executed
  the original fund of the ICDP, the procedures used were not the same as required in the
  additional fund. The TFGA of the additional fund was signed on February 2, 2007 and
  brought into effectiveness on May 2, 2007. During this period the preparation of some
  documents such as the Subsidiary Agreement, modifying the implementation plan,
  Operations Manual, Procurement Manual, simplified tendering documents in Arabic,
  recruitment of a community development consultant (CDC), tendering documents,
  orientation of the ICDP stakeholders, call for proposals, and issuing of the evaluation




                                                58

  report took about 9 months which is considered a long period compared with the
  implementation period of the project.

 The recruitment of two Community Development Consultants (CDC):

  The process of hiring Community Development Consultants (CDCs) took along time.
  Despite the fact that the announcement for recruiting two CDCs, one for the West Bank
  and one for Gaza Strip, was issued on March 6, 2007, all the received CVs did not meet
  the minimum requirements of the position. This also added additional burdens on the
  ICDP staff as they had to carry on the CDC tasks in both the West Bank and Gaza. It is
  worthy to mention that the West Bank CDC was hired on August 15, 2008, and it was not
  possible to hire a CDC in Gaza for the same reason. The evaluation report of the received
  proposals was issued on July 15, 2007, even before hiring the CDC.

  5.2 Factors within PECDAR's Control:

  Since the effectiveness of the ICDP, was during a very vulnerable situation in terms of
  the political and security aspects, PECDAR had taken several measures that helped
  enhance the progress of the on going MPs and the ICDP. PECDAR opened regional
  offices in Jenin, Tulkarem, Qalqilia, Beit Lahem in addition to the original offices in
  Nablus, Al Ram (recently Al Bireh) headquarters and Hebron office. PECDAR also
  assigned part of the permanent engineering staff to follow up and supervise the MPs on a
  daily bases; each engineer was designated to follow up and supervise the projects within
  his residency area.

  In order to encourage the contractors to bid for the MPs, PECDAR facilitated the bidding
  procedures by allowing the contractors to pick up the bid and to submit his offers at the
  nearest office according to their residency. Bid openings for most of the MPs were
  conducted in public at the specified time and date either at the regional offices or in the
  village council sin the presence of the contractors and PECDAR's representative.

  As in regards to the financial management, PECDAR succeeded in securing the payments
  to all contractors within eighteen days of the submitting the approved invoice, except for
  the additional fund. No complains were raised during the implementation of the MPs
  regarding delays in payments. As for the additional fund, the problem of delaying the
  replenishment was solved partially by distributing the available money to the contractors
  in order to help them continue their works and by using direct payment method for larger
  invoices.

  On the other hand, regarding technical and financial monitoring of the ICDP, PECDAR
  adopted a Management Information System (MIS) for both the technical monitoring and
  financial management. The MIS is a powerful tool in which all the ICDP information is
  entered including the technical (progress, units, and scope of work, base unit costs of
  different items, variations, labor content and working days, machinery and milestones)
  and the financial data such as the project budget, payments, retentions, remaining budget
  and guarantees. This information can be retrieved in the form of technical and financial



                                               59

reports containing any required information regarding MPs and other components. The
MIS has the capability of tracking the progress of the MPs compared to the action plan of
the ICDP based on the information and reports imported from the site. The PMO and the
FD at PECDAR modified their reports in accordance with the Bank's requirements and
satisfaction.

6. Assessment of the World Bank Performance:

6.1 During Preparation

The World Bank ICDP team has shown full cooperation and commitment during the
preparation of the PAD of the original ICDP fund. The World Bank staff has shown their
full readiness and complete commitment to work closely with PECDAR. With the close
help of the WB team and the assistance of the different missions from the WB in
Washington, the ICDP documents were prepared within the specified timeframe. The
transition between the ICDP Task Team Leaders was smooth. The ICDP task team leader
have shown high professionalism during the preparation of the ICDP- AF and has played
an effective instrumental role in advising, assisting and supporting the project towards the
declaration of effectiveness and execution within the set timeframe. Despite that the
preparation of the Additional Fund encountered some obstacles and disruption, the rating
for the Bank's performance during the preparation of both funds can be ranked as
Satisfactory.

6.2 During Implementation

In the same context, and despite the lengthy procurement procedures which sometimes
caused significant delays to the projects, the WB team headed by the former Task Team
Leader and the current Task Team Leader has shown full commitment and excellent
cooperation with PECDAR team which were of the main reasons for the impressive
achievements of the ICDP. The ICDP was confronted with several obstacles in terms of
political, security and economical aspects; the wide vision and the complete devotion and
the flexible thoughts of both the WB team and PECDAR team came up with compatible
and practical ideas to overcome the obstacles. As an example of overcoming obstacles,
the situation in Gaza Strip during the implementation of the additional fund; the strict
sanction of the Strip resulted in a complete stoppage of passage of construction materials
which made it impossible to execute the MPs component in Gaza Strip. The WB team
was flexible and professional by approving PECDAR's proposal to reallocate US$ 1.9
million to JCP activities. This flexibility enabled PECDAR to implement the fund
allocations within the anticipated objectives and a proper time frame. The Bank's
performance during the implementation is rated Satisfactory.


7. Conclusion

 Overall, the achievements of the ICDP achieving (80 %) beneficiary satisfaction
    levels and more are considered in general Highly Satisfactory. The direct impact of



                                             60

  the implemented projects included both rehabilitation of community infrastructure,
  creating temporary local jobs during adverse and difficult political and economic
  conditions and the majority of the implemented projects resulted in access to
  permanent services and access to education, health, local council services and
  community multipurpose centres and ICTs. These are considered solid achievements
  and were highly appreciated by the majority of beneficiaries (92 %) who stated that
  the implemented projects have directly responded to their needs.

 The overall performance of the Bank was Satisfactory allover the project life; the
  Bank responded to all the needs and necessary actions were taken in favor of the
  proper implementation of the ICDP. This is one of the major factors that helped
  achieve the ICDP objectives.

 The ICDP projects have positively contributed to facilitating access to services and
  interestingly female respondents (86 %) scored higher satisfaction than males (81 %)
  as any facilitation of access and mobility directly affects women and children who
  usually have less mobility. Similarly, female respondents clearly stated more
  satisfaction with the projects for saving time and effort (83 %) compared to males
  (75 %).

 The training courses provided to LGUs were useful, particularly in the case of
  community procurement projects, many LGU members referred to it as an on-the-job
  training where they have worked closely with PECDAR engineers.

 The ICT projects were individual success stories and had great impact on
  beneficiaries and marked the maximum satisfaction levels among other projects. In
  addition, the ICT projects were unique and different in nature than other micro
  projects. They needed longer implementation time frame and more effort as it did not
  only entail the finishing works and the physical infrastructure, but also the furnishing,
  the equipment, the design and installation of networks and management and operation
  for 18 months.

 The job creation projects in Gaza came at a critical timing and provided immediate
  job opportunities to more than 5000 people responsible for at least 5 other family
  members. The achievements are impressive and some of the beneficiaries received
  permanent job opportunities, or gained new skills and some decided to start their own
  micro projects for income generation encouraged by their experience in participating
  in the project. The quick action of PECDAR and the flexibility of the Bank's
  decisions were the main reason for the success of this new component as an
  alternative to construction due to restrictions on Gaza regarding the import of
  construction materials.

 The achievements of the additional fund were challenged with the delay of the
 replenishment of funds to the implementing agency (the long replenishment cycle)
 and thus resulted in delays in payments. Many contractors and NGOs complained
 that a significant delay in their payments due to the delay in the replenishment



                                          61

   negatively affected their performance especially during the deteriorating economical
   situation.

 The depreciation in the US Dollar also negatively affected the performance of the
   contractors and supplier particularly during the fourth quarter of 2007 and the
   beginning 2008.

 Sustaining skills and capacity building interventions within LGUs is most difficult
   due to two main reasons; the first is that they change over time and second there are
   no mechanisms in place to ensure transfer of knowledge and documentation within
   the LGUs from old to new councils.


8. Lessons Learned

 PECDAR recommends to the Bank, in future design of similar projects that the
   closing date of the project should be extended subject to the date of declaration of
   effectiveness and the approval of other documents, the project preparation should not
   be within the implementation period of the project.

 Though the call for proposals in newspapers is a good practice and enhances
   community awareness of the upcoming projects as well as transparency of the
   operation, it is not necessarily the best way for reaching to the poor and marginalized
   locations. Overall, reading newspapers is low in Palestinian territories, particularly in
   poor and marginalized areas. There is a need to create additional mechanisms for
   reaching to the poor and marginalized.

 In future ICT projects, it is recommended that MOLG should have played a role in
   taking the responsibility for ensuring the management and maintenance of the
   buildings and ICTs in the contract with the beneficiary LGU or local committee for at
   least one year after the closing date of the fund. This is to ensure that allocated
   resources are not wasted or were not needed in the first place. It is recommended that
   in future similar projects, they are included in a separate fund and implementation
   plan is extended in terms of time frame as their implementation and management
   requirements are different from the micro projects.

 In future emergency projects, it is recommended that the replenishment cycle to be
   shorter. In the same context, the advance instalment should be increased in order to
   speed up the payments to the contractors and other supplier of services. In this
   context, PECDAR recommends to the Bank to study the possibility of making
   disbursements by batches according to the implementation plan.

 Regarding training, it is recommended that a sufficient period for the training courses
   and workshops is taken into account at the beginning of the project to make sure that
   the beneficiaries utilize the skills they gained in the training courses during the span
   of the project.
