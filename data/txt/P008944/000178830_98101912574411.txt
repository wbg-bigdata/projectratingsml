REPUBLIC OF TURKEY
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT OF
A HIGHWAY REHABILITATION PROJECT
I. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A. Effects of Geography and Socio-Economic Development on Transport
1.01     Historically Turkey has always provided an important trading link
between Asia, the Middle East and Europe and this function has grown stead-
ily, especially with the development of the Transit International Routier
(TIR) trucking system. Domestic traffic, until 1978/79, had also shown a
steady growth in parallel with increasing population and a developing
economy. However, severe economic problems since 1978 and higher fuel costs
have had the effect of limiting both overall economic and transport growth.
1.02     The land transport system, whilst being sufficiently extensive in
relation to the current distribution of population and economic activity, is
inadequate as regards quality of operation and capacity.  This is due mainly
to either the original standards not being improved to keep pace with traffic
growth, or to deficiencies in management and operations. Recommendations
made as part of the Bank's Structural Adjustment Lending (SAL) to Turkey for
the urgent development of agriculture and domestic energy sources (coal,
lignite and fuel wood) will lead to increasing demands on the transport
system. These, together with existing industrial demands, should be met by
improvements and extension to the system.
1.03     For the most part Turkey has very rugged terrain with areas of
slope instability and others of heavy winter frost and snow; all of which
present severe engineering problems and high costs for the transport sector.
Both roads and railways frequently have to follow very indirect routes thus
increasing journey distances and costs. The analysis of alternative solu-
tions is complicated by these factors, but railways are likely in the long
term to be the most economic mode for major transport flows of bulk commodi-
ties over medium and long distances. These solutions are being addressed
under the National Transport Master Plan (NTMP) (para. 1.15).
1.04     Turkey remains primarily an agricultural country but the share of
agriculture in GDP has declined by about 7% in the past 10 years whilst
industry's share has increased by nearly 20%. Despite this growth in
industry, both the agricultural and industrial sector productivity is low
and, should the steps (reflected in the Bank's SAL program) being taken to
raise productivity be successful, then sectoral and geographical balance
could change significantly, with corresponding changes in transport demand
especially road, rail and port traffic. Since 1977, the economy has been
severely hit by rising oil prices and a slow-down in activity leading to
changes in traffic patterns. Primarily, these changes have been: (a) growth
in trans-shipment of freight destined for Iran and Iraq via northern and



-2 -
southern Turkish ports; (b) a rapid development of road and rail transit,
and export traffic, especially road traffic to Iraq; and (c) a decline of
about 20% in domestic freight. Recent enquiries indicate that this trend
towards increasing transit and export traffic will continue in 1981 and
1982. Even assuming a resolution of the Iran-Iraq dispute, truck transit
traffic will continue for some considerable time in the future and could
lead to higher growth rates than the 5% currently predicted (pars. 4.06).
With a real growth rate of 4-5% in GNP, domestic traffic should also resume
its growth.
B. The Transport System and Issues
1.05     The transport system consists of approximately: (i) 60,000 km of
State and Provincial roads of which about 34,000 km are paved; (ii) 172,000
km of Village (local) roads of which about 6,000 km are paved; (iii) an
unspecified, but in excess of 50,000 km, length of agricultural and forestry
roads; (iv) an 8,200 route km railway system; (v) 19 civil airports (includ-
ing two special tourist airports) of which four cater for regular inter-
national flights; and (vi) 75 public and private ports serving the 7,300 km
coastline. In addition to Turkish Airlines, the national airline, there are
other regular international airlines serving the country and a small private
charter and freight Turkish airline. The pipeline system which is both
military and civil is extensive.
1.06     Traffic statistics for the period 1975-81 have been collected by
the various agencies concerned and collated by the State Planning Organiza-
tion (SPO). Road transport is clearly the most important mode for both
freight and passenger traffic, carrying 60% and 90% respectively of total
traffic. Also coastal shipping is continuing to increase and clearly
deserves close study as an alternative or supplementary form of bulk trans-
port. Preliminary estimates of rail transport for 1981 indicate that the
decline in freight traffic has been reversed. Table 1.1 summarizes the
estimated traffic volumes carried by the different modes during this period.

Railways.
1.07     The main issues facing the transport sector and hence the perform-
ance and development of the economy are;
(a) traffic demand has reached, and in many cases exceeded, the struc-
tural and capacity limits of the system. A priority program of
rehabilitation, especially for highways, and for providing capacity
increases, is required during the next five years if very high
maintenance costs and transport constraints are to be avoided
(para. 3.04);
(b) the efficiency of railway operations is low and the railway can no
longer accept all traffic offered, which places additional demands
on road transport. This railway problem has resulted from a lack



-4-
of spare parts for locomotives due to shortage of foreign exchange
but organizational problems have also been a contributory factor.
More foreign exchange is now being made available for needed spare
parts and operating methods are to be improved following a Bank
financed study. However, infrastructure investment to maintain and
improve the capacity of existing lines will certainly be necessary
as well if railways are to play their proper role as a carrier of
bulk materials (para. 1.17);
(c) current and proposed developments, particularly those generating
large bulk commodity movements (especially, iron ore) will require
not only increases in the capacity of the existing network but also
structural alterations as origins and destinations change. This
issue was not addressed adequately in the past by the Transport
Coordinating Agency (TCA), due to the lack of information on the
needs of transport users. However, the issue is now being studied
during the preparation of the NTMP, for which the Turkish draft was
prepared by mid-February 1982 (para. 1.15). If it is decided that
further detailed studies are necessary, the proposed project would
provide financing from a supplementary studies component
(para. 3.14); and
(d) the development of rural access roads has not been implemented
according to systematic and valid economic criteria in the recent
past. The Bank's Erzurum Rural Development Project is providing a
first step towards rational selection of such roads.
C. Transport Organization, Policy, Planning and Coordination
Organization
1.08     Ministerial responsibilities for planning, project execution, main-
tenance and regulation in the transport sector are:
(a) Ministry of Transport and Communications(MTC) has overall control
of: (i) railways through the Turkish State Railways (TCDD);
(ii) state ports through either the TCDD or the Maritime Bank (DB),
and private ports which are operated by a variety of groups;
(iii) civil aviation through the Turkish Civil Aviation Authority
(DHMI) and Turkish Airlines (THY); and (iv) posts, television and
telecommunications through the Posts and Telecommunication (PTT)
and the Turkish State Radio and Television. In all of these sub-
sectors major civil and infrastructure works are undertaken by the
Ministry of Public Works (MPW) either through contract or force
account. In addition the MTC is responsible for fare and rate
regulation of road transport and the Ministry of the Interior is
responsible for the enforcement of these regulations.
(b) Ministry of Public Works is divided into three main directorates:
(i) the General Directorate of Highways (KGM) responsible for
planning, construction and maintenance of State (primary) and



Provincial (secondary) roads; (ii) the General Directorate for the
infrastructure of State Airports and Pipelines; and (iii) the
General Directorate for the infrastructure of Ports and Railways.
(c) Ministry of Village Affairs includes a General Directorate for
Infrastructure (YSE) which is responsible for maintenance, improve-
ment and construction of Village (tertiary) roads, in addition to
other rural infrastructure. The individual municipalities are
responsible for most of the urban road network a.id municipal bus
services.
Policies
1.09     Road transport is mainly privately operated and entry into the
industry is not limited by operating permits. The only control (apart from
vehicle standards and use regulations) relates to setting maximum and
minimum freight and passenger tariffs. Trucking companies, although there
are officially stated tariffs, will generally negotiate rates and the
mission believes that they cover costs adequately. Bus operators have to
publish and comply with officially approved tariffs (which vary according to
operating conditions and service quality).
1.10     The TCDD which is a State Economic Enterprise (SEE), has experi-
enced operating and financial difficulties in recent years resulting in a
considerable drain on Governn,ent revenues and inadequate resources for main-
tenance and investment. Following the Bank's Turkey Public Sector Invest-
ment Review (TPSIR), decisions have been taken by Government to defer work
on large parts of the investment program that appeared unjustified in many
respects, and to concentrate on improving the existing system, taking into
account recommendations of an operational study financed under the Bank's
Railway Project (para. 1.17). TCDD is seeking external assistance to imple-
ment the recommendations of this study; also tariff revisions to improve
revenues were introduced in October 1981. It is too early to reach definite
conclusions on the results of these actions and it is not yet clear whether
management deficiencies are being corrected. However, preliminary estimates
for 1982 traffic indicate that the decline in services may have been
arrested.
1.11     Ports are operated by the TCDD, the DB and private owners.  Road
transporters are also investing in supporting services in public ports. The
port system, whilst increasing its productivity especially since the assump-
tion of power by the present Government, clearly requires increased capacity
and modernization: this is being addressed by the Bank's Second Port Project
(para. 1.17), which provides a component for the preparation of a Ports
Master Plan.
1.12     The THY is state-owned and operates a network of domestic air
services, which are essential for the proper functioning of the country's
widely separated centers, and a limited network of international routes.
The THY provides "no frills" services at relatively low costs (about 8 cents
per pass/km) which has resulted in high load factors and year on year



- 6 -
operating profits. The DHMI manages airports, provides air traffic control
and generally supervises civil aviation: operations yield a profit which is
adequate to finance most investments by the DHMI.
1.13     Turkish Maritime Lines operates both deep sea and coastal shipping
which is supplemented by limited operation of small private owners and "own
account" shipping operations such as the KGM which owns four bitumen tankers.
Currently shipping capacity is adequate, although coastal shipping demand
deserves to be kept under review (para. 1.17).
1.14     For the next two or three years, Government policy will have to
focus on needs (e.g. transport of bulk commodities by road, and rehabilita-
ting steam locomotives and highways) to provide immediate solutions to key
problems. However, during this period the NTMP should seek solutions con-
sistent with the longer-term needs and resources of the economy. Meantime,
present short-term policies are reflected in the transport investment plan,
where major new investments are being postponed and efforts are being con-
centrated on the maintenance and rehabilitation of the existing transport
system, and to raise operational efficiency.
Planning and Coordination
1.15     In 1980, the Bank mission to prepare the TPSIR noted, as a major
problem, the lack of an integrated view of the transport sector as well as
the lack of coordination of transport planning both within the sector, and
with other sectors. This was primarily because the TCA in the MTC, which
was responsible for transport planning and coordination, had not had suffi-
cient prestige nor been able to retain adequate and competent staff to carry
out its intended functions. The Government noted these findings and in early
1981 set up a core of specialists in the State Planning Organization (SPO),
which is responsible to the Prime Minister's Office, and entrusted them with
the preparation by February 1982 of the NTMP taking account of the technical
plans and inputs of the various agencies involved. An Interministerial
Committee was also established to review the plan and related budget propos-
als. The SPO is adequately and competently staffed for directing and
coordinating transport planning and collaborates well with the agencies
concerned (about 100 in number). It appears, therefore, that the transport
planning system in Turkey into which the highway planning system in the
proposed project will be integrated, (para. 3.08), is now developing to an
appropriate level.
1.16     The present transport planning and coordination system should be
allowed to continue, and its performance monitored. To ensure this monitor-
ing, the Bank expects to have an opportunity to comment upon the NTMP. At
negotiations, the Government confirmed that a copy of the summary report of
the NTMP would be given to the Bank in May 1982 for its review and for
follow-up during subsequent missions to Turkey.
D. Bank Experience in the Transport Sector
1.17     The Bank has participated in three previous projects in the trans-
port sector.



- 7 -
(a) Railway Project, Loan 893-TU, 1973 This loan for US$46.7 million
with an estimated total project cost of US$215.6 million (foreign
exchange US$148.6 million) included track renewal, signalization
and telecommunications, manufacture of rolling stock, modernization
of workshops, training and technical assistance. It was scheduled
for completion by September 1976 but due to slow progress was only
completed in mid-1981. The slow execution of this proiect was due
to bureaucratic delays, frequent changes of Government, laAk of
qualified personnel and economic difficulties.  Nonetheless, physi-
cal targets were reached for improving the efficiency of freight
operations, and for diesel locomotive maintenance, and a study of
railway operations was completed. The results of this study are
being taken into consideration in planning future strategy.
Furthermore, although the financial position of the railway has not
improved, and until recently loan covenants were not adhered to, a
more pragmatic approach to investment and operations has recently
emerged. The need for improvements in the railway sector is clear
especially in view of severe constraints that may arisp in the
transport of bulk commodities.
(b) First Port Project, Loan 28-TU, 1950 This loan for US$12.5 million
included: (a) extensions at several ports; (b) a new port at Samsun;
(c) grain, ore and coal handling equipment; and (d) harbor cons-
truction equipment for MPW. Following agreed project changes, a
supplementary loan of US$3.8 million was made in 1954. Completion
of this project, whilst achieving its objectives, was delayed from
1958 to 1962 (most of the physical works were completed by 1959).
Procurement for a relatively small part of the project led to most
of the delay.
(c) Second Port Project, Loan 1741-TU, 1979 This loan for US$75.0
million, with an estimated total project cost of US$177.8 million,
is aimed at the rehabilitation and improvement of the 10 main
public ports and improvement of port institutions through; (a)
modernization of equipment and floating craft; (b) improvement of
storage and wharf areas; and (c) provision of technical assistance
for training, tariff and management studies and port sector
planning. The project is being implemented smoothly with only
minor problems. Due to some delays in procurement, project
completion is expected to be about one year later than originally
scheduled.
1.18     The Bank's experience in the transport sector has been limited to
two particularly complex sub-sectors. Physical implementation, although
experiencing delays, has generally been satisfactory. Most of the problems
have occurred in implementing policy decisions due to poor coordination in
Turkey and to shortage of skilled staff. However, Government's administra-
tive and coordinating arrangements have improved considerably since 1980,
and with the basically simple nature of the physical works on the proposed
highway rehabilitation project, it should not experience the same difficul-
ties as the previous projects on ports and railways.

II. THE HIGHWAY SUB-SECTOR
A. The Network
2.01     The highway system is extensive and comprises about 233,000 km of
roads (excluding municipal, agricultural and forestry roads) to give an
overall density of about 30 km per 100 km2. Table 2.1 gives details of
the 1980 network.

The major part of this system was built in the 1950's and 60's, since when
little improvement has been carried out. Consequently, a considerable part
of the network, in particular about 3,200 km of the Trans-Turkey Highway
(TTH), which is the country's main transport artery, is now in poor struc-
tural condition and carrying traffic in excess of economic capacity.
Improvements, especially geometric, are often difficult and expensive
because of the rugged terrain and areas of soil instability. Despite very
considerable and effective maintenance efforts, much of the State road
system has deteriorated seriously, and requires strengthening or reconstruc-
tion. The description of typical levels of deterioration are given in
Annex I.
2.02     Apart from the TTH, no detailed inventory of road conditions has
been carried out on either State or Provincial roads, although a sample
survey carried out in 1980 indicated that roads carrying low traffic volumes
are basically sound. A more detailed examination of the State network will
be carried out during the course of the proposed project (para. 3.08).
B. Traffic and Road Transport
2.03     A comprehensive traffic survey is carried out each year on State
and Provincial roads and the results published, but due to economies,



- 9 -
processing results has fallen behind and estimates of recent traffic growth
have had to be made on the basis of sample counts. The majority of village
roads probably carry less than 500 vehicles a day and many may only have
seasonal traffic; traffic often consists almost entirely of agricultural
tractors and trailers or animal-drawn vehicles.
2.04     Tra&fic on ti- state and provincial road sys,LeaL ihas grown histori-
cally at a rate abou: 40% higher than the GDP, but following the economic
crisis, the traffic growth rate has fallen since 1977 below the long-term
9%-10% growth rate predicted then, and is now probably about 5% (para. 4.06).
An exception to this, is transit traffic, especially that stimulated by the
Iran/Iraq conflict, which has increased rapidly on certain roads. However,
despite the decline in traffic growth, traffic in many cases is already
above the structural and geometric capacity of the network. For example, it
is estimated that more than 5,000 km of the state road system, mainly 2 lane
with a daily capacity of 8,000 passenger car units (pcu), are currently
carrying the equivalent of at least 10,000 pcu's.
2.05     Axle load surveys have been carried out periodically in Turkey
since 1974, and are now arranged on a regular basis. Axle loads increased
considerably in the mid-seventies, but recent data show that in the heavily
laden direction, loading appears to be stabilizing for the present over a
wide range of primary routes at about 2.5 standard axles per commercial
vehicle, whilst on the back-haul, the loading is much more variable, ranging
up to about 1.7 standard axles/commercial vehicle. With high volumes of
heavy vehicles, many of the state roads are estimated to be carrying at
least 1 million standard axle repetitions annually in the heavily laden
direction (para. 3.04), and this is more than most of the original pavement
designs allowed. In the back-haul direction standard axle load repetitions
vary on average from 400,000 to 700,000 annually.

With a continued slow-down of economic activity in Europe, private car
imports by returning migrant workers will decline or increase less rapidly
than in the past. The fleet of larger trucks on the other hand, even in the
case of a resolution of the Iran/Iraq conflict, will probably continue to
grow at least at the present rate in order to meet structural changes in
both domestic and transit traffic that cannot be met by alternative trans-
port modes (para. 4.03).
2.07     Road transport, which is the major carrier of passengers and freight
in the country, is largely in the hands of private operators and there is
practically free entry into the industry. Even the state-owned oil company
generally sub-contracts oil product deliveries to private transport firms.
The main road transport services not in private hands are the large municipal
bus services in towns such as Ankara and Istanbul. The structure of the
industry includes many owner-driver operators, cooperatives (transport unions
of several firms) and also very large operators, most of which are also
engaged in international traffic. The largest grouping of truck operators
is the International Transport Union, with 258 companies owning 38,000
trucks, of which 28,000 are regularly engaged in transit trade. All goods
originating in Turkey or arriving at Turkish ports for trans-shipment by
truck to other countries have to be carried in Turkish vehicles. Some local
transport cooperatives now engage in international trade and, in some cases,
have been reported as financing export oriented production and trading
activities. Through traffic may be carried in foreign vehicles as also may
goods originating in other countries and destined for Turkey; no transit
charge is made on a quid pro quo basis with other trading partners or
transit countries (para. 4.05).
2.08     Although official freight tariffs are set for particular routes and
commodities by the MTC, it is common practice to negotiate rates with cus-
tomers. Whilst actual contract rates are not made available, the charges
indicated compare reasonably well with total vehicle operating costs.
However, cost recovery from heavy vehicle operators for the damage their
vehicles cause to the network is far from adequate, and this will be exam-
ined in the proposed project (para. 3.11). Passenger rates vary according
to the area of operation or road condition and the quality of sevice.
Tariffs, which are published, are generally fixed after negotiation with
local authorities and the MTC.
2.09     Apart from the important function played by road transport as a
critical service in socio-economic activity, there are two other aspects of
road transport in Turkey that need to be highlighted:
(a) with the development of economic activity throughout the country,
especially bulk freight generating operations, away from tradition-
al industrial centers and into areas with limited rail access, the
flexibility of road transport, either as trunk or feeder services,
is rapidly leading to this sub-sector becoming a critical one in
short-term development needs. However, in the longer-term, the
most appropriate transport mode should be developed, bearing in
mind the economic and operational advantages of each; and



- 11 -
(b)  the foreign exchange earnings of transit traffic carried between
Turkish pcrts and other countries by Turkish truckers before the
outbreak of Iran/Iraq hostilities amounted to about US$250 million
a year gross which in 1980 was approximately 7% of total exports of
goods and services. Since the start of the Iran/Iraq conflict, it
is estimated that the earnings have risen annually to more than
US$700 million gross or approximately 20% of total exports of goods
and services. For Turkey, the net foreign exchange earnings would
usually be about 40% of transport earnings; however, very cheap
fuel is obtained in Iran and Iraq for this traffic, and the net
earnings are probably higher.
C.  Administration, Acccinting and Auditing
2.10     The KGM organization is shown at Annexes II and III.  It administers
and is responsible for the planning, design, construction and maintenance of
the highways and bridges which form the State and Provincial highway network.
To carry out its work, it relies both on force account and contractors, and
supervision is carried out by the KGM staff. The organization of the KGM
both at its headquarters in Ankara and its seventeen Regional Divisions is
appropriate for these purposes.
2.11     The KGM has a total staff of about 1,325 professional engineers,
600 sub-professionals, 32,600 non-professionals and, in normal times, a
seasonal work force of 15,000. Though salaries are low, the quality of
staff is generally high and availability of experienced personnel is not
expected to be a constraint on project planning and implementation
(paras. 3.08, 3.16 and 3.21). In fact, the size of the work force is much
larger than necessary for the current volume of work that can be carried out
with available funds, and a personnel reduction of about 50% would probably
not reduce the KGM's effective capacity. While it is unrealistic to expect
any sudden, large reduction in staff, the Government is seriously concerned
over the problem and introduced in December 1981 an early retirement scheme
which overall is expected to reduce state-employed personnel by about
40,000. This is a good start, and the situation should be watched in the
next year or two, to see what effect it has on the KGM.
2.12     The main features of the Turkish budgetary system, as applicable to
the proposed project are given in Annex IV. The capital budget generally
comprises allocations to cover the annual cost of investments scheduled for
implementation during the FY and agreed by the SP0. To facilitate the award
and execution of multi-annual contracts, the 1972 law revising the estab-
lishment of the KGM permanently authorized it to enter into contracts for
periods up to five years and for amounts exceeding budgeted funds by 50%.
Also, starting with the Financial Year 1982, the capital budget will include
ab initio all funds required regardless of source, unlike previous years
when Government borrowing for project finance was only included in the budget
at the time of contract award and this naturally led to implementation
delays. These arrangements, together with the provision for multi-annual
contracts and a non-transferable budget for the project, are deemed adequate
for the budgeting of the proposed project and were confirmed by the



- 12 -
Government at negotiations. To ensure coordination between preparation of
the budget and the financial needs of the proposed project, suitable arrange-
ments between the Government and the Bank were agreed for annual budget and
work program reviews (para. 3.23).
2.13     The accounting and auditing system of the KGM and the related
internal and external control procedures are also described in Annex IV.
They are considered adequate for the purposes of the proposed project and no
change is recommended. Financial reporting and external audit requirements
are discussed in para. 3.24.
D. Planning
2.14     Planning in the highway sub-sector (excluding village roads) is the
responsibility of the KGM, SPO and Ministry of Finance. The KGM prepares a
basic program according to its technical and economic assessment of needs
based on the structural condition of roads and on traffic volumes. The
program is then reviewed by the SPO, for consistency with general planning
objectives, resource constraints and transport demand, and also by the
Ministry of Finance for financial constraints and conformity with fiscal
policies.
2.15     The current program comprises a large number (over 400) of projects
started previously, but following recent finance constraints, work has
virtually ceased on many projects with annual budgets often being purely
nominal. As part of the NTMP, the KGM, together with SPO, have carried out
a review of the program to establish a practical list of economic priorities.
This has been particularly necessary because of the rapid deterioration of
many roads and the associated high cost of maintenance and emergency activi-
ties. The review has resulted in the postponement of some large new
projects, including the second Bosphorous bridge and the extension of the
Tarsus-Pozanti motorway, and the diversion of resources to urgent strength-
ening and rehabilitation of priority sections of the existing network. The
Highway Investment Master Plan, which has been developed by the KGM as part
of the NTMP, is expected to further improve this planning approach, and at
negotiations the Government confirmed that in May 1982 it would provide the
Bank with further details of this Plan.
E. Financing and Expenditures
2.16     The maintenance, rehabilitation and new construction of the State
and Provincial highways are financed by: (a) allocations from the general
revenues of Government; (b) earmarked revenues from toll roads, bridges and
tunnels; (c) duties on fuel sales; and (d) miscellaneous sources. These
allocations are made against each year's agreed program but additional funds
may be voted by Parliament during the course of the year.
2.17     The budget is sub-divided into two categories, mainzenance and
investment, each of which includes its respective administra.ion costs
(headquarter overheads, planning, and materials research). The maintenance
budget only covers routine and emergency maintenance and also regraveling.



- 13 -
Other periodic maintenance such as resealing, pavement strengthening and
rehabilitation is included in the investment budget. The cost of maintain-
ing the surplus labor force (largely for social reasons) is proviAed under
the maintenance and investment budgets, and is estimated at about 30% of the
budgeted amounts in 1981. To the extent that it might be feasible, it would
be more appropriate to cover this cost under a separate budget item. Expend-
itures, in current and constant 1976 prices, for the period 1976-1980, and
estimates for 1981 are summarized in Table 2.3.

Total annual KGM expenditures (at constant prices) over the three-year
period 1976/78 were reasonable, and remained more or less constant before
declining in the next two years. Over this five-year period, many roads
were deteriorating rapidly and required more maintenance to avoid major
pavement failures. The 1981 increase in the investment budget, arises from
starting the program of highway rehabilitation. An appropriate balance
between maintenance, strengthening, and rehabilitation programs and their
related budget needs, will be examined during the highway planning study
included in this project (para. 3.09).
2.18      It is difficult to accurately assess road user charges in Turkey
because of the complex nature of taxation statistics. Road user charges
have had to be estimated on the basis of physical quantities and on reported
rates of taxes and duties. The estimates derived are, however, accurate
enough for a comparison (Table 2.4) with road expenditures, and this shows



- 14 -
that road user charges are, as a whole, sufficient to cover road expendi-
tures. However, their incidence benefits heavy vehicles at the expense of
lighter ones, and to review this imbalance, a component is included in the
axle load study under this project to make recommendations on a scale of
license fees for heavy vehicles to reflect the cost of the damage they cause
to the highway network (para. 3.11).

The figures for fuel tax revenues include a fuel stabilization levy, which
has been used to subsidize prices (particularly diesel fuel) in times of
quickly rising costs; the status of this levy can only be estimated, but
over the last four years, it has shown a considerable surplus. The KGM and
the YSE overall expenditures do not understate road needs overall, and there
has been a surplus of revenue over expenditures for the period 1978-81.
This surplus has been tending to decline due, in part, to the slump in fuel
sales and a decline in the sale of new vehicles.
2.19     Following Bank recommendations at the end of 1980, the Government
is making regular revisions of fuel prices and taxes to keep pace with
inflation and to more realistically reflect world prices. In 1981 taxes on
both gasoline and diesel have risen sharply, although November 1981 retail
prices of approximately US$0.70 and US$0.52 per liter respectively are still
about 30% lower than the lowest European prices, but are considerably above
world market CIF prices. The price structure is summarized in Table 2.5,
and shows that, allowing for growth in the vehicle fleet and inflation,
gasoline consumption is price elastic whilst diesel consumption is
relatively insensitive.

2/   Almost 100% of gasoline and 90% of diesel is used in the highway sector.
The very sharp decline in the consumption of both gasoline and diesel
in 1979 was probably caused to a great extent by physical shortages.
The longer term decline of about 25% for gasoline is probably due to
the fall in economic activity and the real increase in fuel prices.
The three year decline of diesel consumption of about 10% indicates
considerable insensitivity to price rises probably due to the
possibility of passing on higher costs to transport users.

Since these fees are unrelated to the damaging effect vehicles have on
roads, the axle load study under the proposed project will, inter alia, seek
to provide better data on which a revision of these fees may be based
(para. 3.11).
F. Engineering
2.21     Design standards are set by the KGM for State and Provincial
highways, and by the YSE for village roads. The design standards of both
the KGM and the YSE are satisfactory. Engineering is carried out by the
agency responsible for the specific project, whilst highway research is
carried out by the KGM. Most of the KGM's engineering is delegated to its
seventeen divisional offices, with the central office exercising overall and
supervisory control. The Research Department of the central office also
carries out some pavement testing and provides all pavement designs. The
KGM uses a well established deflection testing system for the design of
overlays to strengthen existing pavements. Consultants are seldom used for
engineering.
G. Construction
2.22     Construction is carried out by either the KGM or the YSE dependent
on the project. About 50% of the investment and major rehabilitation
program of the KGM is carried out by contract; and the rest by force-
account. The YSE carries out about 40% of its road investment program by
local contract. Consultants are seldom required for supervising contract
construction of highways because the divisional offices of the KGM and the
YSE have the capacity to do so. To carry out the proposed rehabilitation
works, the KGM will have to divert from its other works, a gradually
increasing number of Resident Engineers for works control (para. 3.21),
including some engineers now seconded to Turkish contractors abroad.
2.23     All KGM contract construction is carried out following competitive
bidding open to prequalified contractors on the MPW's register. The register
is reviewed periodically and systematically. The contracting industry is
well established and comprehensive both in its coverage of expertise and the
range of size of firms (from petty contractors to large internationally
competitive firms). The capacity of the contracting industry in Turkey is
considered adequate for this project.
H. Maintenance
2.24     Highway maintenance in Turkey, including snow removal, is exten-
sive, well organized and well executed, and it has been most effective in
preserving many roads. However, since maintenance is not intended to
increase pavement strengths, it is unable to prevent deterioration of the
more heavily trafficked routes, many of which are failing drastically now.
Maintenance also has some limitations when dealing with the extensive
problems of frost and slope instabilities in certain parts of Turkey. To
remedy these deficiencies, reconstruction to improved standards will be
carried out under the proposed project (paras. 3.04 and 3.05).



- 17 -
2.25     Routine maintenance, excluding resealing, regravelling and pavement
strengthening, is carried out by force-account, which is equipment-oriented
and well organized. Responsibility for highway and equipment maintenance is
delegated to the seventeen divisions throughout Turkey.  The equipment fleet
is large (nearly 19,000 items) and comprehensive, but much of it is old and
until recently, there have been some difficulties in obtaining foreign
exchange for the purchase of spare parts; this difficulty continues for the
purchase of new foreign equipment. Dependent upon the outcome of the
overall review on the appropriate balance between the maintenance and the
rehabilitation and strengthening programs, any further studies required for
equipment needs, could be carried out under the supplementary "uncommitted"
studies provided for in the proposed project (para. 3.14). The YSE has a
village road maintenance organization patterned on the KGM one, and also has
a similar, but not so large, equipment fleet.
I. Training
2.26     The Training Department of the KGM has a comprehensive and establi-
shed program of training for its personnel (and those of related organiza-
tions such as personnel concerned with traffic control and safety). The
Training Department has adequate facilities and staff, both in Ankara and
the Divisional Headquarters in various parts of Turkey. Training covers:
(i) basic orientation for all staff from professionals to equipment
operators; (ii) development courses on all technical aspects of KGM work
(with an emphasis on training for mechanics and equipment operators); and
(iii) intensive language courses in English and French. During 1980, about
6,000 KGM staff, or approximately 20% of its permanent work force underwent
training (generally short courses), and the 1981 program plans for 8,600
personnel to receive similar training. Despite this large program, further
courses are required to train medium to upper echelon staff in highway
planning, road safety analysis, traffic engineering, works control, and in
carrying out feasibility studies. The proposed project includes a component
(para. 3.15) for fellowships abroad to study appropriate skills.
J. Highway Safety
2.27     Turkey has for some years suffered from a severe road accident
problem with approximately 5,000 fatalities each year. The authorities are
acutely aware of this problem, which they plan to study so as to make
improvements in highway safety matters. Initially this study and program of
improvements will be limited to the main road system on a pilot basis con-
centrating on identified "black-spots"1. Equipment for this program, which
will be undertaken by the Planning and Traffic Departments of the KGM in
cooperation with other agencies (para. 3.12), is included as a component of
the proposed project.

III. THE PROJECT
A. Objectives
3.01     Both the Government's and the Bank's development objectives have
been strongly influenced by the need to ameliorate Turkey's serious economic
conditions characterized by high inflation, severe balance of payment
problems and a large foreign debt. The Government has already begun to show
some success in curtailing and streamlining the Public Investment Program.
In the transport sector, the Government's investment program follows this
pattern, and gives high priority to rehabilitation and strengthening of the
main highways, and the provision of adequate transport for bulk commodities,
especially those related to the production of energy. Specifically, in the
highway sub-sector, Government investments in the short- and medium-term are
aimed at protecting the existing network, rather than on constructing new
sections of highways.
3.02     The objectives of the proposed project are: first, to improve,
through rehabilitation and strengthening, priority and quick benefit yield-
ing sections of the highway network, in particular those sections which play
an important part directly and indirectly in export earnings; second, to
promote improved planning and control systems; third, to support Government
efforts to improve highway safety and to develop a suitable vehicle loading
control system, and fourth, to provide training for highway staff.
B. Description
3.03     The components of the proposed project are:
(i) a three-year slice of the highway rehabilitation and strengthening
program, for works to be started between 1982 and 1984 (about
775 km) and to be completed by the end of 1986;
(ii) procurement of some priority specialized equipment for highway
rehabilitation works;
(iii) equipment and materials for:
(a) the preparation of future programs of highway rehabili-
tation;
(b) a vehicle axle load monitoring and control system, and
a program to evaluate pavement performance and related
road user charges; and
(c) a highway safety program;
(iv) consultancy services for supplementary studies (as yet uncommitted
but could include studies such as improvement to the highway plan-
ning process, on aspects of road maintenance, and a follow-up on
specific aspects of the NTMP like bulk transport needs); and
(v) fellowships for training.

Highway Rehabilitation Program
3.04     Many highways in Turkey do not have the bearing capacity to meet
present traffic demands. Despite an extensive program of highway mainte-
nance, the condition of these highways is deteriorating rapidly. To limit
or arrest this deterioration, the Government proposes to step up its program
of highway rehabilitation and strengthening for priority sections of the
primary network, and it is a three-year slice (1982-1984) of this program
that is included in the project.
3.05     According to an indicative program prepared by the KGM, this three-
year slice is likely to comprise about 10 individual priority highway
sections totalling about 775 km and estimated to cost about US$250 million
equivalent. The actual length and number of sections will depend upon the
justification of each section and the total cost. The overall extent of the
program has been decided by the Government's financial constraints, and by
planning and implementation constraints. At the time of appraisal, the KGM
had completed detailed engineering and feasibility studies on the first
year's slice (1982), covering three priority sections totalling 251 km
(Annex XII), and at the time of loan negotiations, detailed engineering and
feasibility studies on the next three priority sections totalling 214 km,
had reached an advanced stage and were scheduled for completion by June
1982.
3.06     Traffic volumes on the three roads selected for the first three
priority sections range from 2500 vpd to 5000 vpd with heavy vehicles
ranging from 80% to 90% of the total flow. Traffic volumes are of the same
order on the other roads in the indicative program where similar rehabilita-
tion works can be expected. Each section in the three-year program is being
selected on the basis of meeting acceptable engineering and economic criteria
(Annex I). Feasibility studies of all highway sections in the program,
irrespective of whether or not the Bank is financing them, will be submitted
to the Bank and to co-financiers by the KGM for approval before construction
bids are invited, or before force-account rehabilitation commences. These
arrangements were confirmed with the Government at negotiations.
Specialized Highway Paving and Quarrying Equipment
3.07     Most of the rehabilitation and strengthening works will be carried
out by contract. However, KGM will prepare quarry stockpiles at various
locations by force account and will also carry out small rehabilitation
works by force account in remote and scattered areas. To assist the KGM in
these force account works, the project includes a small component, US$5.9
million worth (Annex VII) for the procurement of specialized quarrying and
paving equipment. This equipment will be sufficient to complement existing
equipment for work at five separate quarry and highway rehabilitation sites.
Equipment for the Planning and Engineering of Rehabilitation Programs
3.08     The KGM intends to adopt improved procedures, criteria and controls
for planning, and will carry out a study to develop a planning system for



- 20 -
highway rehabilitation and strengthening. An interim report on their pro-
posed planning system was agreed with the Bank in March 1982 and is being
implemented and progress will be reviewed in June 1982. KGM will carry out
detailed planning and engineering itself for the second and third year
rehabilitations in this project, and for the longer term rehabilitation
program 1985-87 using this system. To assist the KGM carry out this detailed
planning and engineering, the project includes a component, US$1.0 million
worth (Annex VII), for the procurement of equipment. Pavement deflection
measuring equipment is included in this component, and will be used to
develop a pavement evaluation system and to monitor pavement performance
throughout Turkey in relation to traffic loading and pavement types.
3.09     Also included in the KGM's planning study, is an overall review of
the appropriate mix of the KGM's maintenance, strengthening and rehabilita-
tion programs for the next five years, including an assessment of budget
needs. If, following this review, a further detailed study of road mainte-
nance and rehabilitation is required, it can be carried out under the
supplementary studies component of the project. The Government has con-
firmed that it would give the Bank an opportunity to review the programs for
maintenance and rehabilitation during the annual reviews to be held not
later than September 30 each year starting in 1982 (para. 3.23), and also to
review the KGM's planning system by the date of the first of such annual
reviews. The Government confirmed at negotiations that it will implement on
a continuing basis, a planning process for the rehabilitation of highways in
accordance with terms of reference agreed by the Bank.
Equipment for a Vehicle Axle Load Monitoring and Control Program
3.10     The KGM intends to carry out a study itself to develop a program
for implementing vehicle loading controls. To assist KGM develop, and
subsequently implement this program, the project includes a component,
US$0.9 million worth (Annex VII), for the procurement of equipment to
monitor and control vehicle weights. Axle load legislation in Turkey was
amended in 1980 to bring it more in line with European standards. The
Government intends enforcing the new limit of 10 tonnes per single axle, 16
tonnes for a tandem axle, and a maximum gross vehicle weight of 38 tonnes
and is currently preparing supplementary legislation and enforcement regula-
tions.
3.11     Also included in the KGM's vehicle loading control study, is an
analysis to determine appropriate user charges for heavy vehicles that
reflect the cost of the damage they cause to the highways. The Government
confirmed at negotiations that it will prepare its vehicle load control
program in accordance with terms of reference agreed by the Bank by
December 31, 1983 and thereafter, in consultation with the Bank, will
implement such controls as may be recommended and will review with the Bank
its proposals for road user charges.



- 21 -
Equipment for a Highway Safety Program
3.12     The Government is concerned about road accident rates, and the KGM
intends carrying out a highway safety study itself; (i) to identify accident
"black-spots"; (ii) to determine an appropriate program of highway surface
marking and signing; (iii) to determine the need and requirements for emer-
gency after-accident services; and (iv) to assess the adequacy of existing
traffic procedures, legislation and driver education. To assist the KGM
prepare this study and implement the highway safety program, this project
includes a component, US$3.6 million worth (Annex VII), for the procurement
of highway safety materials and related equipment, including rescue trucks
and road line painting machines.
3.13     Arising out of the highway safety study will be proposals for
implementing safety measures to reduce the incidence and severity of
accidents, and a program to monitor highway safety and evaluate the results
of implementing highway safety measures. The Government confirmed at nego-
tiations that it will prepare a traffic safety program by July 31, 1984 in
accordance with terms of reference agreed by the Bank, and will implement
the safety program in consultation with the Bank.
Consultancy Services for Supplementary Studies
3.14     Following the preparation of the NTMP and the setting up of the
KGM's proposed planning system, or during the preparation of the axle load
control and highway safety programs, the need may arise for supplementary
consultant studies on deficient areas o-f the planning process and of the
KGM's operations. Since these studies cannot be identified at this stage,
provision is being made to include a component (US$600,000 equivalent) in
the project for about 80 man-months of consultant services to carry out such
studies. The studies will be identified and implemented as the need for
them is determined. Likely subjects could include: (a) traffic forecasting
methods; (b) data collection, storage and retrieval; (c) vehicle operating
costs; (d) follow-up studies on future budget requirements for road mainte-
nance and rehabilitation, and the appropriate balance between maintenance
and rehabilitation work; (e) follow-up studies on the NTMP in areas such as
bulk transport; and (f) assessing measures to make more effective use of the
KGM's redundant labor.
Fellowships
3.15     To assist KGM in improving its planning and construction techniques
and in the preparation of feasibility studies, a limited number of fellow-
ships abroad (about 60 man-months, depending upon costs) are proposed for
engineers and economists in transport economics, highway planning, contract
evaluation and project supervision and control. The fellowships will be
provided, probably in Western Europe, by agencies such as contractors, con-
sultants, State Highway Departments and Universities, and will be arranged
by the KGM Training Department directly with the agencies concerned.
Detailed lists of proposed fellowships will be reviewed by the Bank ann-- -
during the overall annual project reviews (pcra. 3.23>



- 22 -
C. Engineering
3.16     The KGM, which has demonstrated a high level of technical compe-
tence in the engineering of highways, is preparing the detailed engineering
and economic evaluations for the three-year highway rehabilitation program.
For the highway sections in the first year of the rehabilitation program,
this work was completed in November 1981 and is scheduled to be completed in
stages for the remaining years by September 1983 at the latest (465 km out
of 775 km are likely to be completed by June 1982). Appraisal of the highway
rehabilitation component of the project was based upon the 251 km of highway
sections proposed for the first year of the program. The engineering and
economic studies on these sections have been carried out in accordance with
technical and economic criteria acceptable to the Bank.
D. Cost Estimates
3.17     The estimated total cost of the proposed project (including about
US$35 million of taxes and duties) is US$264 million, of which US$140 million
are estimated to be foreign costs. Details of the cost estimate are shown
in Table 3.1 (page 23). At negotiations, the Government and the Bank
discussed and confirmed the cost estimate.
3.18     The costs of highway rehabilitation for the first year's time slice
are based on quantities (including 5% physical contingencies) derived from
the detailed engineering already done, and the KGM's December 1981 unit
prices for contract works. These unit prices are comparable to those
obtained from bidding on similar works in Turkey. Costs for the rehabilita-
tion in subsequent years are based upon the costs of the first year's time-
slice, together with an additional 5% allowance for physical contingencies.
The foreign exchange component of pavement rehabilitation works is estimated
at 51% overall, based upon the expectation that half the contracts will be
won by local firms whose foreign exchange component is estimated at 46%,
while that of foreign firms is 56%. The foreign exchange component of
earthworks contracts associated with these rehabilitation works is estimated
at 35% and is based on the expectation that local firms will win all of
these contracts. The capital cost of equipment and materials are based upon
estimates using 1981 CIF prices for imported goods (excluding import duties),
and for local goods, the ex-factory costs net of taxes. For ex-factory
equipment, local production, preparation and delivery costs are estimated at
40% of the equipment cost. All equipment costs include an allowance of 15%
for purchase of spare parts. Equipment costs to prepare the long term
program for highway rehabilitation and for the programs for vehicle axle
load control and highway safety (estimated at US$5.5 million) are included
in the project, though the KGM will carry out the associated studies with
existing staff, and will meet all other related costs from their budget.
Fellowships costs are based on current costs in Europe and North America of
about US$3,000 per man-month. For consultancy services, a lump sum of
US$600,000 at 1981 prices is included based on estimated costs of US$12,000
per man-month on an average for foreign consultants to include salary,
costs,fees, international travel and subsistence, and US$6,000 equivalent

per man-month on an average for local consultants to include salary, costs,
fees and subsistence. It is expected that some, if not all, of these
services would be provided by Turkish experts. Depending upon the propor-
tion of Turkish experts that might be provided, this lump sum would allow
between 50 and 100 man-months of consultancy services.
3.19     The total length of highways to be rehabilitated may be more or
less than the presently estimated 775 km, depending upon the average cost
per km; also the quantity of highway safety materials may vary according to
the extent of the safety program to be proposed. On the remaining project
components, contingencies are estimated at 10% for quantity increases.
Contingency allowances for price escalation, allowing for increases of 8.5%
in 1982 and 7.5% p.a. thereafter have been estimated overall at 21% in US$
terms on the basis of the overall implementation schedule.
E. Financing
3.20     The proposed Bank loan of US$7l.l million would provide about
US$70 million to finance; (i) the foreign costs of contract construction of
specific sub-projects which comprise slightly under half the highway rehabi-
litation program; (ii) on a similar basis, half of the supplementary studies;
and (iii) all the foreign costs of equipment, materials and overseas fellow-
ships. In addition, the Bank loan would provide UStl,050,739 to finance the
front-end fee. The remaining foreign costs of contract construction for
highway rehabilitation, and half the foreign costs of the supplementary
studies, estimated at USS70 million, are expected to be parallel co-financed
by the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development (KFAED). It was confirmed
by the Government at negotiations and agreed by the Bank that, in view of
the KFAED's appraisal requirements, the Bank would finance all (three) of
the rehabilitation sub-projects in the first tranche (Annex XII) on the
basis that the KFAED would make up the imbalance with larger shares of
subsequent tranches. The Government confirmed at negotiations that it would
request the KFAED to finance at least two of the three sections in the
second tranche, and that it would confirm to both the KFAED and the Bank not
later than April 30, 1982, its requested allocation for the third section.
The supplementary studies are divided equally between the co-financiers
because they both wish to participate in the studies. The proposed financ-
ing plan is shown in Table 3.2 (page 25). KFAED financing is expected to be
one loan made in two parts, the first in late 1982, and the second in 1983.
The Government would finance the remaining project costs (including force
account rehabilitation costs) estimated at US$124 million equivalent. Prior
to negotiations, the KFAED confirmed to the Bank and the Government its
intention to co-finance. The Government confirmed at negotiations that it
would keep the Bank informed of progress in its arrangement for co-financing
(including the allocation of the third rehabilitation sub-project in the
second tranche), and that it will provide sufficient funds for the project.
At negotiations the Bank and the Government agreed the cross-default
provisions in the proposed Bank loan in relation to the KFAED loan.

F.   Implementation
3.21     The KGM will be responsible for implementing all components of the
project except for any supplementary studies in support of the NTMP which
will be implemented by SPO, though the KGM will be responsible for overall
loan and project administration. These arrangements were agreed with the
Government during negotiations. Project implementation will be spread over a
period of five years ending December 1986, based upon the detailed Project
Implementation Schedule for 1982 which was drawn up as a critical path
diagram (Annex V) and on the overall Implementation Schedule (Annex VI).
The overall Implementation Schedule has been adjusted, following a check
against the Bank's historic disbursement profiles, to provide an allowance
of one extra year to complete the 1982-84 rehabilitation program, covering
any unforseen circumstances. Despite the efficient performance of the KGM
in preparing the project, this is considered a reasonable allowance in view
of it being the first Bank project in this sub-sector. Engineering for this
program started in 1981 and is expected to continue through 1983, allowing
contracts to be let on a phased basis year by year starting in mid-1982.
Where earthworks and paving works are required, the earthworks will be
advanced by letting contracts separately from the paving works. The KGM
will supervise the rehabilitation contracts with its own staff through its
field divisions, and has adequate resources for this purpose. The KGM's
proposed organization for a contract supervisory team is shown at Annex XIV.
The Government confirmed at negotiations both its choice of the three sub-
projects for the first tranche of the rehabilitation program (Annex XII),
and that it will submit to the Bank not later than April 30, 1982, the names
and designations of the staff they propose for supervision of the first
three contracts scheduled to start in July and August 1982.
3.22     Equipment and materials will be procured by the KGM in two tranches,
the first in 1982/83, (for about 80% of the total allocated, as shown in
Annex VII) and the remainder in 1984, when the various studies and programs
proposed under the project have been further developed. At negotiations,
the Government agreed the list of equipment and materials to be procured
under the first tranche. The highway planning, axle load control, and
highway safety studies will be carried out by the KGM and are scheduled to
commence by July 1982 and will all be completed by July 1984. The supple-
mentary studies will be agreed with the Bank and will be implemented by
consultants as the need for them arises. Procedures for implementing
supplementary studies were discussed with the Government at negotiations.
The fellowships will be spread over the period of the loan.
3.23     Project monitoring and reporting procedures include the preparation
by the Government of: (i) indicative multi-year overall project programs on
an annual basis, (ii) detailed annual programs each year, (iii) quarterly
progress reports (physical and financial), (iv) feasibility study reports,
(v) bid evaluation reports, and (vi) audit reports. Details of the require-
ments for these reports and programs are shown at Annex VIII. Annually, and
not later than September 30, each year, commencing with 1982, the Government
and the Bank, in consultation with the KFAED, will review:



- 27 -
(a)  project performance during the current year;
(b)  the implementation plan for the remainder of the project;
(c)  the detailed work and training programs of the project for the
forth-coming year;
(d)  the next year's selection of highway sections for rehabilitation,
and their allocation to each co-financing agency;
(e)  the project budget for the forthcoming year; and
(f)  the indicative highway rehabilitation program for the next three
years.
These annual review arrangements, leading to agreement on each year's
program for the project, were confirmed by the Government at negotiations.
3.24     A format of quarterly financial reports has been designed and
agreed with the KGM and these meet the Bank's requirements regarding the
monitoring of project expenditure, financing resources and Bank disburse-
ments. The financial reports will be prepared by the KGM's Accounts and
Budget Department and sent separately to the Bank within 45 days after the
end of each quarter, the first report covering March 1-June 30, 1982.
Financial control procedures are essentially based on a priori checking and
there is no systematic a posteriori external audit. During negotiations,
the Government and the Bank agreed the auditing requirements for the
project, and the Government confirmed that it would submit to the Bank not
later than September 30 each year, starting in 1983, appropriate audit
reports for the preceding financial year (Turkish FY ending December 31).
3.25     Since coordination is critical for successful project implementa-
tion, a Project Control and Coordinating Team (PT) should be set up within
the KGM as a condition of Board Presentation. The Project Coordinator has
already been appointed, and he participated in loan negotiations. At
negotiations, the Turkish delegation confirmed that the Government would
send confirmation to the Bank of the establishment and full staffing of the
PT by April 23, 1982.
3.26     At negotiations, the Government confirmed the Implementation
Schedule (Annex VI) and agreed: (i) to adopt reporting procedures, all of
which are acceptable to the Bank (Annex VIII), and (ii) to maintain the PT
in accordance with the agreed organization and functions (Annexes IX and X).
C.   Procurement
3.27     Civil works, to be financed under the Bank loan, for contracts
exceeding US$3 million equivalent each, and estimated to cost in total about
USWl00 million, will be awarded following international competitive bidding
for which prequalification will be required, and in which suitably qualified
local contractors will be invited to participate. Contracts expected to be



- 28 -
less than US$3 million each and estimated in total to cost about US$20
million, will be procured under local competitive bidding procedures, which
are acceptable, but foreign prequalified firms will be allowed to partici-
pate.!/ Rehabilitation contracts are expected to range in size from about
US$2 million to US$12 million each. To the extent practicable, contracts
will be arranged for works estimated to cost more than US$3 million each,
and the scheduling of procurement of civil works will allow bidders to take
account in their bids of cost savings arising from the possibility of winning
more than one contract. Nine Turkish firms and two foreign firms have been
prequalified for the first year's slice of the highway rehabilitation
program. For civil works not being financed by the Bank, the KGM will carry
out the work either through contracts awarded under the procurement proce-
dures of the co-financing agency KFAED, or by force-account from its own
budget.
3.28     Equipment and materials contracts, estimated to cost in total about
US$9 million, will be awarded following international competitive bidding in
which local suppliers will be invited to participate. Local suppliers will
be allowed a margin of preference of 15% or actual customs duty, whichever
is the lower. As an exception, specialized equipment (such as for measuring
pavement deflections) and estimated to cost in total about US$2 million, may
be purchased under procedures acceptable to the Bank by negotiated contracts
with qualified suppliers. Contracts between US$10,000 and US$50,000 each,
and estimated to cost in total not more than US$300,000, will be eligible
for local competitive bidding that does not preclude foreign firms in
accordance with Government procedures which are acceptable.2/ Contracts
under US$10,000 each may be procured through local shopping with a limit of
US$100,000 overall. Bids will be evaluated on the basis of cost, delivery
time, reliability and subsequent dealer service. Consultants services,
under the supplementary studies, will be provided by qualified and experien-
ced consultants, either domestic or foreign, or in joint ventures, and in
accordance with terms and conditions all satisfactory to the Bank. At
negotiations, the Government agreed to all these procurement procedures.
3.29     All contracts for civil works being financed under the Bank Loan
and estimated to cost more than US$5 million equivalent and for goods over
US$400,000 equivalent, would be subject to the Bank's prior review of
procurement documentation resulting in a review coverage of about 70% of the
total estimated value of works contracts financed under the Bank loan, and
about 83% of goods contracts.
1/ Ten contracts are expected to be less than US$3 million, and five
contracts in excess of this amount, (representing 75% of the value of
civil contracts).
2/ Five contracts are expected to be less than US$50,000, and 16 contracts
in excess of this amount (representing 98.5% of the value of goods
contracts).



- 29 -
Remaining contracts would be subject to random post review by the Bank after
contract award. All fellowships proposals will be reviewed by the Bank
annually during the overall project annual review.
H.   Disbursements

- 30 -
3.31     The estimated closing date for the loan is June 30, 1987.  Where
there is co-financing (Categories (1) and (4)), the financiers will partici-
pate in separate sub-projects to be identified and allocated on an annual
basis by September 30, each year starting in 1982, except for the highway
rehabilitation projects scheduled to start in 1982 which have either already
been allocated to the Bank and the KFAED, or which will be allocated shortly
(para. 3.20). So as not to discriminate against the local consulting
industry, the Bank will disburse against local consultancy costs under item
(4) to the same extent as would occur if foreign consultants were employed.
For local equipment suppliers winning in international competition, the Bank
will reimburse 100% of the ex-factory costs (excluding local taxes). The
schedule of cumulative disbursements (Annex XI), which is based upon the
critical path diagram showing the first batch of equipment and civil works
contracts being let in 1982, was confirmed by the Government during
negotiations.
I.   Environmental Impact
3.32     The highway safety program to be prepared under the project will
address itself to traffic safety problems at accident "black-spots" and the
need for accident emergency services and pavement markings. The implementa-
tion of this program is expected to have a beneficial effect on traffic
safety in Turkey as also will the improvements to the shoulders and pave-
ments of highways being rehabilitated under the project. Since the proposed
rehabilitations and reconstructions will be along existing alignments, no
significant displacement of people, nor adverse modifications of the
environment are anticipated.
IV. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A. Introduction and Economic Context
4.01     The economic analysis of the proposed program for the rehabilita-
tion of Turkey's highway network is based upon the conventional criteria
associated with vehicle operating cost (VOC) savings, changes in highway
maintenance costs and highway rehabilitation costs. However, in view of the
country's economic problems and, particularly, the large balance of payments
deficit, special attention has also been paid to the economic importance of
highway improvements on those roads that contribute directly to foreign
exchange earnings or are important in international trade. The sections
chosen for rehabilitation in the first year's tranche of this project, and
upon which this economic analysis is based, are all on the international
trade route between Mersin and Iraq.
4.02     Direct earnings of foreign exchange by the trucking industry
derived from trans-shipment of goods arriving in Turkish ports, especially
Mersin, Iskenderun and Trabzon, during 1981 are estimated to amount to more
than US$700 million (equivalent) of which about 85% originates from the
Mersin/Iskenderun-Iraq road. Of this total, it is estimated that nearly



- 31 -
US$300 million represents net foreign exchange earnings (paras. 2.07 and
2.09). Furthermore, an estimated 2 million tons of cement and 0.5 million
tons of agricultural and livestock products were exported along this road in
1981.
4.03     Much of this traffic has resulted from the severe reduction in
shipping using Arabian Gulf ports due to the Iran/Iraq conflict. Thus the
question arises whether the traffic will continue upon resolution of this
conflict. This is a difficult question to answer, but the main consider-
ations are believed to be as follows:
(a) traffic crossing the Turkey/Iraq border at Habur has increased from
about 600 vpd including 300 trucks in 1979 to about 2500 vpd, of
which about 90% are trucks, at the middle of 1981: consequently
considerable trading relationships via this route have been
established and are likely to prove resistant to a major switch
back to the Gulf ports;
(b) Turkish truck operators and, reportedly, Iraqi import agencies are
investing in port facilities (storage and handling) at Iskenderun
and Mersin thus improving services and indicating confidence in
continued trade at least in the medium-term; this is further
supported by firm plans to open a Europe to Mersin Ro-Ro service in
1982; and
(c) upon resolution of the conflict, and assuming the reopening of Gulf
ports, it is also probable that reconstruction needs will increase
the demand for commodities even further and will exceed Iraqi and
Iran port capacity for some time: moreover, the distance of many
consuming areas in Iran and Iraq from port facilities, the
relatively long sea journey from Europe, and costs reflecting
uncertainties of Gulf shipping, could make the trans-Turkey route
cost competitive.
Taking these factors into account, it is believed that the total volume of
international truck traffic could continue at least at its present levels,
although eventually there might be reductions in some traffic categories.
However, for the purposes of this economic analysis, it is considered that
the longer-term traffic levels will lie somewhere between pre-war and
existing traffic. It has, therefore, been assumed that the base year
transit traffic component of total traffic will be half way between pre-war
transit traffic and mid-1981 transit traffic. Estimates of daily transit
traffic to and from Iraq in mid 1981 were 1850 medium/heavy trucks and 380
articulated trucks compared with about 500 medium/heavy trucks and 75
articulated trucks in mid-1980, before the outbreak of hostilities.
4.04     Finally, if an overall saving in vehicle operating costs of 20%
were assumed, which is minimal considering the poor condition of the project
roads, it is estimated that the foreign exchange cost of rehabilitation,
with constant traffic flows, could be repaid in about two years.

B. Traffic and Traffic Growth Rates
4.05      Table 4.1 gives the results of 1981 traffic counts (rounded) for
the three road sections proposed for the first year's program.
Table 4.1: Traffic Volumes on First Year's Highway

Source; KGM
The traffic on the primary routes comprises:
-   Local Traffic, which makes up the greater part of light vehicle
traffic has shown a decline during 1979-81, largely as a result of
the decline in economic activity and the rapid increase in fuel
prices. In urban areas particularly, researchers at Istanbul
University report there has been a significant shift to public
transport or work buses. If Government policy on fuel prices
continues, any growth in local traffic will be limited.
-   Long Distance Domestic Traffic which is typically long distance
buses and the ubiquitous 12/15 ton rigid truck, operates between
the main centers of population and economic activity. Whilst this
traffic, especially freight, has been influenced by the decline in
economic activity and higher fuel prices, 1979-81, this has been
less pronounced than for light vehicles (increased costs being to
some extent recoverable). It is expected that starting in 1982,
based on real GNP growth, an annual traffic growth rate of about 5%
will develop. Furthermore, developments in some areas, particular-
ly in industry and agriculture, could lead to very sharp increases
in traffic - for example, fertilizer production and wheat growing
in the Mesopotamia area.
-   Turkish import/export traffic  consists mainly of Turkish owned
12/15 ton rigid trucks and 20/24 ton articulated trucks. While
this traffic has experienced a decline of about 20% between 1978
and 1980, during 1981, it has begun to grow again and on the road
leading to Iraq, approximately 2 million tons of cement exports and
500,000 tons of agricultural and other exports have been trans-
ported. It is anticipated that this traffic will experience an
annual growth of about 4-5% in the short to medium term.



- 33 -
International Transit Traffic  has been partly discussed in
para. 4.03 above. It consists of: (a) trucks whose origins or
destinations are in Europe and which are mainly 20/24 ton articula-
ted trucks, of which about 30% are foreign owned and operated;
(b) 20/24 ton articulated and 12/15 ton rigid trucks whose origins
or destinations are Turkish ports (especially Iskenderun, Mersin
and Trabzon) and are 100% Turkish owned and operated. Foreign
transit trucks contribute little if anything to the tax revenue
since no transit charges are levied upon them, and reductions in
their operating costs are therefore excluded from the benefit
streams.
4.06     Prior to 1979 long-term traffic growth rates were 10% p.a. for
light vehicles, 6% p.a. for buses, 8% p.a. for medium, heavy and articulated
trucks. However, in view of the significant changes in the economy of the
Mediterranean/Middle East region, and increases in fuel prices, both of
which have created uncertainties in estimated traffic growth rates, the
economic analysis has been carried out using a general growth rate of 5% p.a.
C. Vehicle Operating Costs
4.07     Vehicle operating costs estimated by the KGM were considered to be
too low and were adjusted for the economic analysis to take into account the
findings of recent surveys and research on vehicle operating costs. The KGM
will re-examine and revise its vehicle operating cost estimates during the
course of the project in consultation with the Bank and this was agreed at
negotiations.
D. Economic Justification
4.08     Apart from the benefits likely to be derived from direct foreign
exchange earnings and the facilitation of export traffic, the comparison of
costs and benefits based on vehicle operating and road maintenance cost
savings against capital investment costs, shows the following results for
the proposed first year's program (Table 4.2). Vehicle operating cost
benefits comprise 98% of the total benefits, and maintenance cost benefits
the remaining 2%. The technical details of the sections proposed are
described in Annex XII. Details of the calculations are available in the
project file, whose index is at Annex XIII.

Source: Appraisal Mission
The results in Table 4.2 cover a ten-year analysis period and show that,
even assuming significant increases in costs or reductions in traffic, the
proposed rehabilitations and strengthenings would remain economically
viable. For example, should traffic on the Akinci-Sakhlan road fall to its
pre-Iran/Iraq war level (approximately 25% of the AADT used in the analysis)
and remain at this level throughout the analysis period (i.e. zero growth
rate), whilst costs rose by 5%, the ERR would decline to 19%. The economic
justification of the proposed investments is thus insensitive to the
uncertainties that could reasonably be expected. Although some individual
sections to be selected in future annual programs may not result in such
high rates of return, it is expected that they will easily exceed the
cut-off rate of 20% in view of high average traffic flows, the large
proportion of heavy vehicles and the present light construction standards.
4.09     The benefits of the small equipment and materials components and
for the studies and fellowships cannot be justified quantitatively, though
it is clear they will prove very beneficial for the planning and control
process of KGM and for the safety of road users. In addition, the quarrying
and paving equipment will be of considerable benefit where contractors
cannot compete in remote and scattered areas for small rehabilitations.

E. Project Risk
4.10     Project risk is not so much related to "institutional" arrangements,
as it is to the overall economic situation in Turkey. Present economic
trends are encouraging, but the success of the project will depend on
adequate and timely financing. Should any downturns in the economy occur,
and the project were to be delayed for this reason, then the country would
not realize the potential high benefits of the project as quickly as
envisaged.
V. RECOMMENDATIONS
5.01     During loan negotiations, the Government confirmed:
(i) that it would give an opportunity for the Bank to comment upon the
NDIP and the Highway Investment Master Plan (paras. 1.16 and 2.15);
(ii) the provision of annual capital budgets for the project ab initio
regardless of the source of finance, the non-transferability of the
project budget, and the multi-annual nature of the project
contracts (para. 2.12);
(iii) that it would give an opportunity for the Bank to discuss the KGM's
road rehabilitation and maintenance planning system by the
September 1982 date scheduled for the first annual review of the
project (para. 3.09);
(iv) its arrangements for co-financing (para. 3.20);
(v) the details of KGM supervision arrangements for highway rehabilita-
tions (para. 3.21);
(vi) the procedure for implementing any supplementary studies
(para. 3.22); and
(vii) that it would re-examine vehicle operating costs in Turkey in con-
sultation with the Bank (para. 4.07).
5.02     During loan negotiations the Government agreed;
(i) that consultations will take place between the Bank and the Govern-
ment at negotiations and not later than September 30, each year
commencing in 1982 to review: (a) project performance during the
current year; (b) the implementation plan for the remainder of the
project; (c) the detailed work and training programs of the project
for the forthcoming year; (d) the next year's selection of highway
sections for rehabilitation, and their allocation to each co-
financing agency; (e) the project budget for the forthcoming year;
and (f) the indicative highway rehabilitation program for the next
three years (paras. 2.12, 3.23, and 3.31).



- 36 -
(ii) that feasibility studies for all highway sections proposed for
rehabilitation under the project and selected on the basis of
meeting acceptable engineering and economic criteria, will be
submitted to the Bank for approval before construction bids are
invited (para. 3.06);
(iii) that the preparation of the highway safety and the axle load
control programs and implementation of the planning process for
rehabilitation of highways will be in accordance with terms of
reference agreed by the Bank, and that thereafter the programs will
be implemented in consultation with the Bank (paras. 3.09, 3.11 and
3.13);
(vi) on the list of highway sections selected for the first tranche of
the rehabilitation program and the list of equipment and materials
to be procured initially (paras. 3.21 and 3.22);
(v) on the scope, extent and timing of submission of audit reports to
the Bank (paras. 3.24);
(vi) on the adoption of reporting procedures acceptable to the Bank
(para. 3.26); and
(vii) on the setting up and maintainance of the PT (para. 3.26).
5.03     In addition, as a condition of Board presentation, the full PT has
been set up in accordance with an agreed organization and functions
(para. 3.25 and Annexes IX and X).
5.04     Based upon the above assurances and agreements, the project is
suitable for a Bank Loan of US$71.1 million equivalent to the Republic of
Turkey for a 15-year term including a 5-year grace period.

ANNEX I
REPUBLIC OF TURKEY
HIGHWAY REHABILITATION PROJECT
Criteria and Methodology for
Use in Economic Feasibility Studies
A. Context of Studies
1.       Tne proposed road rehabilitation projects will be studied in relation
to Turkey's economic and social needs. Thus, in addition to the conventional
economic justification on the grounds of transport cost savings and road main-
tenance or reconstruction savings, speciaL attention in the establishment of
priorities will be given to:
(a) the contribution, if any, traffic makes to direct foreign exchange
earnings through, for example, transit trade;
(b)  the importance of traffic to the export of commodities;
(c) transport requirements of local economic developments; and
(d) the part that the project will play in both saving energy and the
promotion of domestic energy resources.
Whilst these criteria may not always be quantifiable, they should be clearly
described and related to the proposed investment.
2.       For such identified road sections, and in relation to predicted axle
loading and residual pavement strength, engineering solutions will be designed
and costed including an assessed allowance for physical contingencies.
Experience shows that for road strengthening overlays the design life should
be taken as 10 years and for road reconstruction/construction 20 years,
allowing for strengtnening with future overlays predicted on the basis of
axle-loading. Tne discount/cut-off factor appropriate to Turkish conditions
1981/82 is estimated at 20% but this should be kept under review. Where
appropriate, residual values will be included in the calculations.
3.       These criteria and methodology will be reviewed at regular intervals
and, based on this, modified as necessary.
B. Traffic
4.       Traffic will be measured at statistically selected points on the
project roads and for a significant period. Traffic counts will be supplemen-
ted by sample origin and destination surveys to provide a breakdown by vehicle
type into:



- 38 -
ANNEX I
(a)  local traffic - probably less than 50 km radius;
(b)  domestic long distance traffic;
(c)  import/export traffic divided into Turkish and non-Turkish vehicles;
and
(d)  transit traffic divided into Turkish and non-Turkish vehicles.
5.       The estimated rates of growth for each traffic category will be
prepared and related to economic and social indicators for the duration of the
analysis period. Although non-Turkish vehicles will be excluded from the
economic analysis as they contribute little, if anything, to the economy, they
will be included for the purposes of road design. If no clear traffic growth
trends can be established, projects should be tested at 0% growth and 5%
growth.
C. Vehicle Operating Costs
6.       Appropriate base vehicle operating cost figures will be established
for the different categories of vehicles on smooth, flat, tangental roads and
these will be allocated a VOC co-efficient of 1.0. The effect of road condi-
tions on VOC will, initially, be represented by the following modifying VOC
co-efficients.
Fair Condition estimated at about 4,500 mm/km of roughness and, based
on the Transport and Road Research Laboratory (UK) equation, having an average
VOC co-efficient of, light vehicles 1.14, buses 1.10, medium/neavy trucks
1.11, articulated trucks 1.18.
Bad Condition severely deteriorated and deformed, frequent potholes
and advanced edge failure causing vehicles to reduce speed and occasionally to
take evasive action (considerably beyond confidence limits of existing
research parameters): estimated VOC co-efficients of, light vehicles 1.27,
buses 1.23, medium/heavy trucks 1.24, articulated trucks 1.32.
Very Bad Condition road has failed with loss of surface, large number
of potholes, severe erosion of shoulders and culvert failures (well beyond
research parameters) vehicle speed severely affected and frequent evasive
action: estimated VOC co-efficients, light vehicles 1.67, buses 1.51, medium/
heavy trucks 1.64, articulated trucks 1.77.
7.       The following table gives mid-1981 mission estimates of vehicle
operating costs (net of taxes) on good condition, level tangental roads under
Turkish conditions and the effect on these of the three levels of deteriora-
tion described in para. 6 above. It has been agreed with KGM that in the
light of recent research, these costs will be re-examined during the course of
the project.

These figures do not include time costs which are dealt with separately as a
function of speed except for crew costs on buses and trucks.  Current speed
relations are not really valid for the severely deteriorated roads.
8.         During the course of the project the data base for vehicle opera-
ting costs will be kept under review and, together with the vehicle speed
and vehicle operating cost co-efficients, will be revised according to the
most recent research results modified as far as possible for Turkish condi-
tions.
Constraining Parameters
9.        For all projects two basic alternative strategies will be tested:
(a) limited to increasing maintenance only which will, in many cases,
still lead to progressive deterioration and hence rising VOC until
reconstruction becomes necessary: equations from the Transport and
Road Research Laboratory's Road Transport Investment Model may be
used to establish deterioration if actual conditions show this to
be appropriate, if not engineering judgements based on local
experience will be made and justified; and
(b) undertaking rehabilitation, strengthening or reconstruction as
appropriate depending on: (i) current physical condition;
(ii) predicted axle load repetitions; (iii) traffic volumes; and
(iv) engineering costs.
10.       For road strengthening and surface rehabilitation, the analysis
period should be for a maximum of 10 years. For reconstruction and major
rehabilitation the analysis will be for a maximum of 20 years taking due
account of additional overlays required during this time.
11.       For 1981/82 a discount/cut-off rate of 20% shall be employed but
this will be reviewed from time to time in relation to national economic and
resource conditions.



- 40 -
ANNEX I
12.       Based on relevant data for each proposed alternative and the
"do-nothing" scenario the analysts will calculate (i) the net present
value(s); (ii) benefit/cost ratio; (iii) economic rate of return; and (iv)
first year rate of return. The results of these calculations together with
other specified criteria (e.g. foreign exchange earnings, export transport)
and management considerations will be used to justify project roads and
actions and to establish priorities.
Sensitivity Tests
13.       Probable limits will be established for independent variables
(e.g. traffic levels, VOC savings, construction costs) and based on these
the sensitivity of dependent variables (e.g. costs, economic rate of return)
will be tested and "switching values" established.

ANNEX IV
REPUBLIC OF TURKEY
Highway Renabilitation Project
Budgeting, Accounting and Auditing Procedures of KGM
I. Main Features of the Budgetary System
A. General
1.       The budget of the State covers a period of one year; the FY presently
starts March 1; however, it has been decided that, as from 1983, the FY will
coincide with the calendar year; consequently the budget for FY 1982 will only
cover a period of ten months.
2.       The budget comprises two parts:  the recurrent and the capital
budget.  Preparation and consolidation of the budget is the responsibility of
the Ministry of Finance; in addition the capital part of tne budget is also
reviewed by the State Planning Office (SPO) to ensure that the proposed
allocations are in line with the headings of the Five-Year Development Plan.
The proposals are to be approved by the Prime Minister, and voted on by the
legislative branch. The budget act becomes effective immediately after publi-
cation in the official gazette. In the past, this occurred traditionally
before the beginning of the FY and no special arrangements (such as provi-
sional budget allowances) had to be provided for. The Minister of Finance
reserves the right to release only part of the budget allocations if cons-
traints on the state financial resources so command; for instance, allocations
under the FY1981 budget have been limited to 90% of their original amount,
except for some projects of special priority. By the end of the FY, unspent
budget allocations are cancelled and provision is automatically made in the
following annual budget for payments of funds committed under the previous
budget.
3.       Transfers between recurrent and capital allocations are prohibited,
except, in some instances, for wages and salaries. Transfers within the
recurrent budget are possible subject to prior authorization by the Minister
of Finance; the same procedure applies for the capital budget but, in addi-
tion, concurrence of the SPO is necessary.
4.        In the Turkish system the capital budget does not make a distinction
between multi-annual commitment authorizations and annual payment authoriza-
tions; budget allocations are annual tranches based on estimated progress of
work, and payments due during the FY. In the case of large projects to be
carried out over several years, Ministries may have to enter into contracts
for a total amount in excess of the corresponding annual budgeted tranche of
funds; in such instances prior authorization from the Ministry of Finance
(acting in conjunction with the SPO is required, special arrangements exist
for KGM as described below.



- 44 -
ANNEX IV
B. KGM
5.       KGM's recurrent and capital budget is presented as an annex to the
general budget of the State. KGM's recurrent budget provides for different
headings and subheadings, separating - in a traditional way - expenditure of
different nature, such as wages and salaries, travel costs, materials, equip-
ment, etc. The capital budget contains allocations to cover works, listed in
the Five-Year Development Plan, and scheduled for implementation during the
FY. Because of the particular nature of road construction and rehabilitation
contracts, the 1972 law establishing KGM authorizes the latter to enter into
contracts for periods up to five-years, and for amounts exceeding by 50% the
budgeted funds. This gives KGM the needed flexibility to adjust its work
program within the budgetary system.
6.       Capital works are either carried out by contract or by force account.
In the former case, the capital budget makes - in addition to the cost of work
- allowance for supervision costs. In the case of force account the capital
budget makes provision for wages, salaries, materials, fuel for vehicles and
heavy road equipment, but not for depreciation; thus budgeted costs are under-
stated. From a budgetary point of view no distinction is made between state
and provincial roads. A detailed analysis of the budgeted works would
probably reveal expenditure for current maintenance which should normally be
provided for in the recurrent budget; however, they do not seem to lead to
major distortions.
7.       For large investment projects partly financed by borrowing the
Turkish capital budget traditionally only provides for the portion financed by
own funds, and the anticipated contributions from the Bank and other external
financiers would not originally be budgeted.  At the time of contract award
the Ministry of Finance would have to amend the budget by incorporating on th-
expense side, the additional funds required by KGM, balanced on the income
side, by the expected contributions from external financing. To prevent any
delay resulting from such procedure the Ministry of Finance has confirmed
that, for the proposed project, all funds required would be initially budge-
ted, regardless of their source of financing.
II. Accounting
8.        Practically all financial functions in Ministries are carried out by
staff of the Ministry of Finance. Such staff is detached to the various
Ministries; they can be transferred from one Ministry to another; they are
fully independent from the management of the Ministries they are assigned .o;
they report to the Minister of Finance who intervenes in case of conflict.
9.        In KGM two departments are exclusively staffed by personnel from the
Ministry of Finance: the Department of Accounts and Budget (DAB), and tni



- 45 -
ANNEX IV
so-called Auditor's Department. Both departments are part of the internal
control system described in paragraphs 12 and 13; they keep che books listed
below.
10.      KGM's accounts are single-entry, and kept on a cash basis.  The
system comprises the following ledgers, sheets, statements, and reports:
(a) at the beginning of the FY a budget expenditure ledger is opened; it
lists for each budgetary heading and subneading the budgeted amounts,
the portion released by the Minister of Finance, and the distribution
of allocations between headquarters and districts;
(b) simultaneously a headquarters budget ledger is opened, it records the
part of each budget allocation to be handled by headquarters; it
shows under each sub-heading the invoices and bills received;
(c) identical ledgers are opened in each district for the part of budget
allocations assigned to them; monthly reports are sent to DAB which
prepares consolidated statements;
(d) a "commitment sheet" is opened for each contract; it lists all
project references: contractor, date, amount, variation orders,
delays, extension, letter of guarantee, etc.; it also records the
date and amount of invoices received. No budgetary cross-reference
is made on these sheets which may concern many FY's and annual budget
allocations; and
(e) payments is the responsibility of the Auditor's Department (see
para. 12); records pertaining to cash outlays are kept by the
auditors assigned to each of KGM's districts and to KGM's head-
quarters; KGM's headquarters auditor receives monthly statements from
each district auditor and prepares consolidated statements of
payments made. These are copied to DAB which thus centralizes all
information on budgeted, contracted, invoiced and paid amounts.
11.      Tne accounting system is fragmented and cumbersome and it could be
streamlined; it is heavily controlled as further discussed (para. 12). It has
a clear advantage for bank monitoring purposes in that all project related
financial data are finally received in one department, DAB, a prime candidate
to meet Bank financial reporting requirements.
III. Internal and External Control System
12.      There exists an intricate system of successive financial controls
essentially carried out by staff from the Ministry of Finance. The various
steps are summarized below.



- 46 -
ANNEX IV
(a) Before calling for tenders, bidding documents are reviewed by KGM's
Award Committee; DAB, as a member of the Committee, checks whether
sufficient funds have been budgeted for the project concerned, and
whether the tender procedures are in compliance with the regulations.
(b) The Turkish system requires that - as from certain amounts to be
determined each year - letters of award must receive the prior
approval (VISA) of the Court of Accountsl' and/or of the Ministry
of Finance (Budget and Financial Control Department). The present
regulations call for:
(i) contracts of less than TL5 million: no prior VISA needed, but the
Ministry of Finance and the Court of Accounts must be informed of
the expenditure;
(ii) contracts between TL5 and TL10 million: the prior VISA of the
Court of Accounts is required; the Ministry of Finance must be
informed of the expenditure; and
(iii) contracts for more than TL10 million: the prior VISA of both the
Ministry of Finance and the Court of Accounts are needed.
There seems to be no particular difference between the control carried out by
the Court of Accounts and that performed by the Ministry of Finance. The
approval procedure is said to be speedy, one week on the average.
(c) Invoices are checked, in the following order, by:
(i) KGM's Construction Department (on technical matters);
(ii) KGM's Technical Accounting Department;
(iii) DAB, which prepares vouchers to be signed by tne Director of DAB
and by the General Manager of KGM; and
(iv)  Auditor's Department, which, in addition to numeral checking,
ensures that sufficient funds are available in KGM's account with
the Central Bank. The Auditors, either at Headquarters or in the
districts, pay by checks under their sole signature.
13.      The above system ensures that the operating and financial functions
act independently from each other, and that the disbursement of funds is
clearly separated from accounting. It is, however, worth noticing that, in
such a cautious system, one person, the auditor, is given authority to handle
1/ An independent statutory body responsible inter alia for reporting to
Parliament of the use of public funds.

ANNEX IV
a transition - the payment - completely. In this respect the position of the
Turkisn Government is that the numerous prior controls performed by different
administrative entities, acting independently from each other, are sufficient
to ensure that undue payments are not made. This is in all likelihood the
case, and no particular action is proposed regarding payment procedures.
IV. Financial Reporting Requirements
14.      A tentative format of quarterly financial reports has been prepared
as a basis for discussion with KGM's management and DAB; the outline is in
Appendix 1. The report would consist of:
(a) one sheet (Parts A and B), as attached. For each component included
in the project (whether or not Bank-financed), all data being cumu-
lative since the start of the project; and
(b) one consolidated sheet (Part B) for all project components.
Such reports would meet the requirements of the Bank regarding the monitoring
of:
(a) expenditure of project components;
(b) counterpart funds provided; and
(c) Bank disbursements.
DAB could centralize all information requested in the report except for Bank
disbursement data which would have to come from the Central Bank. Issuance
of tne report within 45 days of the end of the quarter is possible and
reasonable. DAB's staff is competent to produce the report and no special
staff arrangements are needed. The first project expenditure being scheduled
for March/April 1982. The first report will cover the four-month period of
Marcn 1-June 30, 1982. The Ministry of Finance agreed to such arrangements
which should be confirmed during loan negotiations.
15.      The possibility to include financial reporting into the duties of
the Project Control Unit has been considered, and ultimately discarded
because of staffing difficulties. However, the Project Control Unit would
receive a copy of the quarterly reports prepared by DAB, so as to compare
financial data with actual physical progress and scheduled programming.

ANNEX IV
V. External Audit
16.      There is no external audit per se of KGM's activities.  At the end
of the FY, DAB prepares a consolidated report covering all commitments, pay-
ments, outstanding budgetary allocations to be cancelled, etc. The report is
sent to the Ministry of Finance. Its content is not systematically audited
although sporadic checks may occur. To remedy this situation it has been
agreed with the Ministry of Finance that the last cumulative quarterly report
of each FY, as described in para. 14, will be audited by inspectors of the
Ministry of Finance. The auditor's report and opinion would be sent to the
Bank as soon as available but, in any case, not later than six months after
the end of each FY; the first auditor's report would cover the period
March 1-December 31, 1982.
