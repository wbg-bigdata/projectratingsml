PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
TURKEY
HIGHWAY REHABILITATION PROJECT
(LOAN 2137-TU)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Highway
Rehabilitation Project in Turkey for which Loan 2137-TU was approved on May
11, 1982 in the amount of US$71.1 million. The loan was closed on June 30,
1987, as scheduled. The loan was fully disbursed and the last disbursement
was made on June 29, 1982.
The PCR was prepared by the Infrastructure Operations Division of
the Turkey and Pakistan Department of the Bank's Europe, Middle East and North
Africa Region. The Borrower assisted with the economic re-evaluation of the
civil works projects, but declined to the Bank's invitation to contribute a
Part II to the report.
Preparation of this PCR was undertaken during supervision missions
of the follow-on project, the Second Highway Project (Ln. 2439-TU), and is
based inter alia on the Staff Appraisal Report, the Loan Agreement and
supervision reports.

EVALUATION SoUM4R
INTRQOTION AND BACKGROUND
I.       The socio-economic setting against which the project was identified
and prepared is discussed in paras 3-25 of the April 20, 1982 President's
Reot (PR). Paras. 2.01-2.27 of the April 22, 1982 Staff Aporaisal feoert
(SAR) describe the status and prospects of the highway subsector in the early
1980s. The salient feature was that most of the roads had not been designed
to meet the growing traffic demand ad that despite extensive maintenance
programs, were deteriorating rapidly. 'te project was to support Government
efforts to rehabilitate and strengthen the network, with emphasis on highways
which played an important part in foreign exchange earning.
II.      When the project was appraised in November 1981, the Bank was
familiar with constraints on project implementation in Turkey. The First
Railway Project of 1973 and the Ports Rehabilitation Project of 1979 had
revealed important stumbling blocks that had to be removed. The OED report on
the First Railway Project (Report No. 5768 of June 30, 1985) and the PCR on
the Ports Rehabilitation Project (OED Report No. 6213 of May 21, 1986) discuss
in detail reasons for cost overruns, for time overruns, and for partial
achievement of project objectives.
Q8IECIES
III.     Intended: Improve through rehabilitation and strengthening priority
sections of the network; promote improved planning and control systems;
support the Government's efforts to improve highway safety and develop a
suitable vehicle loading control system; provide training for highway staff
(SAR, para. 3.02; PCR, para. 5).   Achieved:  The objectives-of the project
were substantially achieved.
IMPLEMENTATION EXPERIENCE
IV.      Experience with the implementation of the different components
constituting the appraised project (SAR, para. 3.03) was as follows:
a    A three-vear time slice of the highwav rehabilitation and
strengthening program (about 775 km.) to be comoleted by 1986.
A total of 965 km. of TETEK road sections were rehabilitated,



- ii. -
of which 337 km. were financed by Kuwait Fund, and 628 km. by the
IBRD loan. The average cost was about US$158,000 per km.
b    Procurement of specializged egUiMene for highway rehabilitatign
works. This was handled with speed and efficiency. The items
procured went into immediate service on KGM's force account
maintenance work (para. 14).
c    EauiDment and materials for {i' the nregaration of future
Rrograms of highway rehabilitation: (iL) a vehicle axle loading
and control system. and a program to evaluate pavement
nerformance and related road user charg2es: and (LiiQ a highway
safety proeram.  The equipment was procured.  A  working
pavement management system is not yet in place, and the road
user charge study was not completed until two years after loan
closure. The highway safety program is ongoing and successful
(para. 17).
d    Consultancv services for supRlementarX studies (unommitted at
Board airnroval but which could include studies such as
imRrovement to the higha  planninf process. on asgects of-ro
maintenance, and a follo_w-u  of the National Tra=rt Master
Plan like bulk transRort need. The PCR discusses consultancy
services in general under Xpara. 31/ and says that, on the
whole, and despite the earlier reluctance of the Executing
Agency to use consultants, these were satisfactory. Study
results took a long time to come (PCR, para. 17) but have been
of moderdte use. The Highway Safety Study has contributed to
the implementation of an effective and well-monitored safety
program. The completion of the road user charge study was
delayed until September 1989, because data on user revenues
was slow in coming from other Government departments (PCR,
para. 18).
e    Fellowshigs for training of hiehway staff.  Satisfactorily
completed (PCR, para. 15).
V.        The borrower complied with all covenants except the requirement to
prepare a Project Completion Report (para. 29).
RESULTS
VI.      The estimated prolect cost was US$264 million (including about US$35
million of taxes and duties) with about US$140 million representing foreign
costs (SAR, para. 3.17 and Table 3.1). The IBRD-financed parts of the project
had a total appraised cost of US$127.9 million. Actual proiect cost of thi
IBRD-financed parts of the project was US$123.5 million.



- iv -
Planned grojeot comoletion war in December 1986 (SAR, para. 3.21). Actual
nrolect completion was on June 30, 1989, though two civil works contracts were
not complete at that time and were finished using funds from the follow-on
project. The Loan was closed on June 30, 1987. Calculated under a variety of
assumptions, the estimated Economic Rate of Return (ERR) for three road
sections ranged from 47X to 349X (SAR, paras. 4.01-4.09). Re-estimated ERRs
for three completed sections representative of the three major areas of
influence yield from 43 to 681 (PCR, para. 23).
SUSTAINABILITY
VII.      The PCR states (paras. 25-26) that project-generated benefits
regarding both vehicle operating costs and institutional improvements are
sustainable.
FINDINGS AND LESSONS
VIII.    The PCR shows that the project was successful in achieving its
physical targets. There was also considerable progress made in introducing
improved methods of project preparation which led to smooth preparation of a
follow-on project. The Turkish Government is a good partner in implementing
the "hardwarel elements of a project.  It was more difficult to get the
Borrower's cooperation for the studies and policy elements of the project.
The lesson to be learned is that preparation should have been more advanced
before Board presentation. In particular, terms of reference (TORs),
shortlists, and consultant proposals for studies should have been cleared
during preparation.

Sector Develo2nent ObIetives. Policy. Context  and Macroeconomic Linka2es
1.       The Bank's involvement in the transport sector has been small and
sporadic. To date, the Bank has made only 7 loans to the sector versus over
30 in industry and over 20 each in agriculture and energy. Of these 7
projects, one was made in the 50s (First Port Project, Ln. 28-TU) and one in
1973 (First Railway Project Ln. 893-TU). Five loans were then made between
1979 and 1986, two each for ports (Ln. 1741-TU and Ln. 2535-TU) and highways
(Ln. 2137-TU and Ln. 2739-TU) and one for railways (Ln. 2739-TU). The total
amount lent in the sector amounts to US$743 million. Operations have focussed
on increasing the productivity of the existing system and the effictency of
the transport sector agencies and enterprises; preserving the existing
infrastructure and equipment through adequate maintenance; and expanding the
system to avoid bottlenecks affecting the productive sectors of the economy.
2.       This project marks the first involvement of the Bank in the highway
sub-sector in Turkey, mainly because the road network had been developed to
fairly good standards during the postwar years with the assistance of USAID.
With the rapid increase in domestic traffic and international transit between
Europe and the Middle East, roads deteriorated rapidly in the late 70s. In
1977, the Government asked for Bank assistance for the rehabilitation of the
Trans-Turkey Highway (TTH) which not only serves as a transit route, but also
links the major 4conomic centers of the country from the west to the eastern
borders with Iran and Iraq. After promising initial contacts, project
preparation slowed considerably, as the Borrower tried to decide the extent of



cooperation it wanted with the Bank in the highway subsector. This was
compounded by the serious economic and political problems affecting Turkey in
1979/80.
3.        It was only after a productive macroeconomic dialogue had been
reestablish, through Structural Adjustment Loans (SALS) which began in 1980,
that Bank dealings with tke transport sector also improved. Preparation of
this project was resumed in 1981 and was well linked with the macroeconomic
objectives prevailing at the time. tor instance, the 1981 Public Investment
Review (PIR)V called for a reorientation of public investment toward critical
infrastructure needs and an improvement in economic evaluation of projects by
implementing agencies. The third SAL I, approved at the same time as this
project, argued that immediate priority should be given to rehabilitation and
expansion of investments in infrastructure and energy since such projects were
crucial to remove production bottlenecks, support private sector growth and
facilitate export-led growth.   Within this framework, preparation of this
project resumed and was completed quickly. In retrospect, the decision to
resume preparation in 1981 within the adjustment framework was appropriate and
timely.
Proiect Objectives and Descriotion
4.        The experience with the railway project (Ln. 893-TU) of 1973
suggested the need for realistic objectives; originally scheduled for
completion by 1976, the project was only completed in 1981. Also, since this
project was the first operation in the highway sector, it was decided to keep
it reasonably simple. This decision turned out to be wise.
5.       The objectives of the Highway Rehabilitation Project (HRP), which
was signed in May 1982, were firs, to improve the highway network by
rehabilitation and strengthening of certain priority sections; V  sec       to
improve planning and control systems in the General Directorate of Highways
(KGH); third, to support Government efforts to improve highway safety and
develop a suitable vehicle load control program; and fourth, to provide
training for KGM staff. The project consisted of the following components:
!J  Report No. 3472-TU, December 1981.

towards exports.



(i)     a three-year slice of the national highway
rehabilitation and strengthening program,
covering about 775 km., to be initiated
4.ring 1982-84 and completed by the end of
1986; '
(ii)    provision of specialized highway paving and quarrying
equipment to complement existing equipment at about five
quarry and rehabilitation sites;
(iii)   development of a planning system for highway rehabilitation
and strengthening, including necessary equipment;
(iv)    development of a vehicle load control program and a highway
safety program, including necessary equipment;
(v)     provision of 60 man-months of fellowships for highway
related staff: and
(vi)    supplementary studies on highway or transport operations as
agreed.
Proiect Design and Organization
6.          The government's expressed desire to upgrade priority sections of
the Trans Turkey Highway was initially a response to severe criticism in
Europe and the Middle East regarding the poor condition of Turkish highways in
the mid-70s.   It was recognized that highway expenditures had not kept pace
with the growth in traffic, and therefore road standards were no longer
adequate to satisfy rising volumes of domestic and international traffic. A
project brief was prepared in December 1977, but languished until November
1980, when a formal identification mission took place.   During this period, a
consensus developed among Bank staff and officials at the Ministry of Public
Works (MPW), KGM, and the State Planning Office (SPO) that alleviating
transport constraints was essential to the realization of Turkey's
macroeconomic objectives in the context of high inflation, severe balance of
payments problems, and a large foreign debt. The urgency of this task became
more apparent after the Project Brief highlighted key transportation
bottlenecks w'nich could thwart achievements under the Bank's SAL program which
supported Turkey's shift to export-led growth. The renewed emphasis on
alleviating transport constraints was thus heavily influenced by the
deteriorating macro-economic balances and the shift in national development
strategy.v
4So be financed by IBRD and rZuwait Fund.each providing about US$70 million.
The Bank 's first SAL for Turkey was approved in 1980. The third SAL was approved by the Board
during the week following approval of the Highway Rehabilitation project, thus emphasizing the
complementary nature of adjustment operations and infrastructure investments. Specifically, the
highway rehabilitation project was expected to facilitate higher exports and reduce in maintenance
expenditures, measures designed to support external and domestic adjustmewts respectively.



- 4 -
7.        The physical components of the project were well prepared, an
important contributing factor to later success in implementing physical works.
It was simple in design and appropriate for the Bank's first investment in the
sub-sector.   Government's administrative and coordinating arrangements had
improved by 1980 and given the simple nature of the physical works, KGM was
expected to be able to carry out the project efficiently. Consultants would
undertake studies when necessary to supplement KGM staff expertise.
8.        KGM was responsible for the project preparation effort, but received
strong support from several Bank missions  (Table 8b).   Most economic and
technical feasibility studies for proposed sub-projects had been completed and
approved by the Bank within one month of loan signature (May 82) and local
funds were committed by the government.   Bid documents for 70X of equipment
to be procured during the first tranche of the operation had already been
prepared by the time of loan signature and US$60 million in ICB contracts had
been let for rehabilitation works within the first six months. The strong
preparation effort also enabled the government to secure assurances of
parallel financing from the Kuwait Fund prior to Board presentation in May
1982. Loan signature was two days after Board presentation. (Tabie 2).
9.        The fact that a single agency (KGM) was responsible for all aspects
of the project contributed to its success.   The project also gave appropriate
emphasis to institutional objectives. The need for institutional
strengthening was recognized by KGM itself during the preparation process.
Solutions were thus not imposed, but worked out in a collaborative manner
during preparation and taken up by the executing agency. The long period of
preparation led to a high degree of political commitment from the government
and counterpart agency.
10.      The Project Control and Coordinating Team (PT) was established
within KGM prior to negotiations. The unit proved to be an effective and
efficient organization with requisite leadership and backing from senior
management in KGM. The PT was involved in project design from an early stage
with the Coordinator attending negotiations. This helped to prevent future
misunderstanding regarding their role and responsibilities. The necessary
support of other Ministries for project financing and processing was also
assured at the outset thus allowing KGM to proceed with a clear mandate and
resources. Establishing monthly cash flow requirements and backing from
Treasury in particular, helped to ensure that the major project risk
identified during appraisal, i.e. shortages in local cost financing, did not
occur.
11.      The time frame established at appraisal for implementing
rehabilitation works and costs was generally realistic. However, works as
initially designed underestimated actual traffic growth and did not anticipate
legislation increasing axle load limits (para. 16). Modification of original
pavement designs to increase structural capacity was necessary in 1985
resulting in cost e_calation. As a result, completion of two paving contracts
were completed using Second Highway Project funds, once loan 2137-TU funds had



-5-
been exhausted. The time frame and terms of reference established for the
axle load, pavement research, and traffic safety studies were also overlv
optimistic given the technical issues involved and KGM's reluctance to recruit
necessary staff and employ consultants. (para. 17) Difficulty in ottaining
information from other governmental entities also hampered progress on the
user charge study.
Project Implementation
12.      The implementation phase of this project was characterized by
relatively fe   .jor problems in construction and supervision of physical
works. Although there had been frequent changes of director-general in KGM
during preparation, there was only one change during the implementation
period.  There was no major re-organization of KG?M during this period, and the
committees set up to span the otherwise rather rigid inter-departmental
boundaries worked well. The PT exercised its monitoring, control, evaluation,
and re.porting functions efficiently. The need for additional staff was
flagged early in supervision (October 1982) when reporting to the Bank was in
arrears. This was quickly remedied when KGM agreed to strengthen the team
with two new positions, finance additional staff training in project
management, and computerized monitoring systems were set up with assistance
from Bank specialists.   Withdrawal applications, quarterly progress and audit
reports were provided to the Bank on a timely basis.
13.      The planning, design and preparation of contract documents for the
sixteen road contracts was well handled. With Bank advice on methodology, the
Planning Directorate produced gor. economic evaluations of each road section,
and the design and contract documents basically followed KGM's existing
practice, with modernization of pavement design methods, and document changes
to comply with Bank guidelines on procurement. The departments concerned were
strengthened by exposure to the methods of the Bank and the requirements of
FIDIC and international competitive bidding. This benefit was retained and
made the preparation of the second project much smoother. However, although
KGM's contract document was extensively modified (and translated into
English), one established Turkish practice --that of calling for bids
expressed as a percentage reduction in the Government's published estimate--
was retained. KGM argued that there was no difference in the competitive
effect of the two methods, but their contractors were familiar with the system
in force, which was in fact mandated by law. The Bank accepted this argument
for the project, but this led to serious problems during start-up of the
second project, when following a change of management, the Bank would no
longer accept this practice. Turkey claimed that the existing practice
already accepted by the Bank should be retained, and bidding was delayed. It
should be noted that the Turkish contracting market is very competitive (some
60 firms applied for prequalification) and this practice nevertheless achieved
fairness and competitior.



14.      Disbursements on the HRP were slower than expected through FY84. !
This was due to an exceptionally harsh winter in 1982/83 during which all
construction was halted. Although this could not be anticipated, KGM and
contractors accelerated works, and disbursements improved rapidly to converge
on appraisal estimates by the end of FY 83 (see Table 3). The Bank allowed an
increase in the disbursement percentage for paving from 51% to 65X and for
earthworks from 35% to 49X in 1984, and remaining funds were disbursed on
schedule. There were revisions of schedule 1 of the Loan Agreement in
December 1984, February 1985, and June 1986 to adjust for the changes in
disoursement percentage (see table 5b). Throughout implementation there were
no major delays due to counterpart funds not being available. Procurement was
also handled efficiently. 80% of equipment for phase 1 of the project had
been delivered by October 1983, only 14 months after the loan became
effective. All bids had been awarded by March 1984 and equipment t-as
delivered according to schedule. A comparison of estimated and actual project
cost3 is shown in Table 5a. Table Sb shows the distribution of the loan
between disbursement categories, and how it evolved. Total cost was US$4.43
million less than the appraisal estimate, but this result masks the heavy
devaluation of the lira that took place over the implementation period, and
does not account for the two contracts that were completed under the follow-on
project at a cost of $2.07 million. This also masks the cost of thickening
the asphali layers to absorb higher axle loads (see para. 16), so cost
comparisons are not very meaningful.
15.      A component not sufficiently detailed during preparation was
overseas training for KGM staff. This was recognized during the first
supervision mission. A training consultant from UNDP was immediately engaged
by KGM as suggested. He arrived 3 months after loan effectiveness, and
recommended a three year program of courses for engineers and supervisory
staff. To minimize disruption to normal duties, KGM settled for sherter
courses (generally 2-3 weeks) for groups of 10-14 where interpreter use could
be maximized.  Training began in June 1983.   The project budget was adjusted
from US$200,000 to US$300,000 to cover the extra cost of the new program.
Training took place mostly in the United Kingdom where the logistics and
placement of trainees was sub-contracted to the British Council, an
arrangement which worked well. A total of 89 KGM engineers received training
under this arrangement.
16.      Construction of physical works, drainage, earthworks, and sub-base,
progressed as scheduled. These works were executed by "tacherons" (i.e. small
contractors) selected by local competitive bidding from the lists of firms
registered with KGM for its own works. Paving contracts, however, progressed
at slower-than-anticipated rates, due to weather and supply constraints.
Bitumen shortages were experienced by some contractors during 1985. In the
follow-on project it was finally realized that domestic production could not
keep pace with the increasing volume of works, and the loan agreement was
amended to allow for the import of bitumen from the international market,
v   Actual disbursement were 231 of appraisal estimates in FY83, 711 in FY84.

which incidentally provided a higher quality product. The major variance in
project estimates, however, resulted from legislation in June 1985 which
raised the maximum load for a single axle from 10 tons to 13 tons. The
increase in axle loads compounded with heavier than expected heavy vehicle
traffic on trunk routes to Iraq U required design thickness increases on all
IBRD-financed paving contracts, which raised the cost of paving contracts by
about 25X. Most of this overrun was covered by continuing devaluation of the
lira. However, two of sixteen paving contracts V were still incomplete by
the time the loan had been fully disbursed and were continued under the
follow-on Second Highway Project (Ln. 2439-TU, Board approval - June '84).
17.      The other major variance in implementation occurred in studies to
examine highway safety and axle load control. Data collection for the safety
study was initiated and an interim draft submitted according to schedule in
March 1983. Deficiencies in data regarding accident location, travel
direction etc. caused the Bank to reiterate its earlier recommendation that a
specialist in highway safety be engaged to assist KGM. Delays were
anticipated by the Bank and the original due date for the final study was
extended from July 84 to December 1985, and later to December 1986. During
this period, Bank missions continued to press KGM to hire consultants and even
drafted Terms of Reference.  KGM initially agreed to this proposal, but later
changed its position.  The government did finally engage Middle East Technical
University and Istanbul Technical University to assist in "black spot"
analysis. Vehicle inspection was improved through German Technical assistance
which has eventually resulted in the launching in 1988 of a large program of
vehicle testing based on 90 fully instrumented test centers operated by the
private sector, for which bids had been received. The final safety study was
completed in 1987 under covenants in the Second Highway Project Loan
Agreement. Delays were the result of KGM's lack of experienced staff in this
area, reluctance to recruit outside consultants on a timely basis, and
deficiencies in data available from accident reports. There was clear
recognition among all parties that improving highway safety was an important
priority and KGM constructed crash barriers, posted highway signs, and trained
traffic officers in other ministries during the project implementation period.
There is now an effective and well monitored safety program in KGM with
engineering measures having reduced the aggregate length of road considered
"critical" by 35 percent, between 1984 and 1987.
18.      Delays were experienced in the axle load study and related analysis
of user charges.   The study was originally due on December 31, 1983, however,
government was already enforcing maximum axle loads using 21 fixed weigh
stations and 48 mobile stations by November 1982.   The companion analysis of
user charges and of the damaging effects of heavy vehicles had to be postponed
An important contributing factor to the increase in traffic was the continuing war between
Iran/Iraq which spurred demand for Turkish exports. While the appraisal did try to anticipate
such occurrences, the level and duration of this conflict and consequent demands on Turkish
infrastructure were of course impossibLe to predict.

until December 1985, by which time legislation raising axle loads had been
passed. KGM's Research and Planning departments had completed an excellent
study on incremental highway costs resulting from heavy vehicle use by April
1984, but additional analysis was required to compare the optimal solutions
presented with the actual user charges in effect.   This comparison was
delayed until September 1989, due to the inability of KGM to obtain necessary
data on road user revenues from SPO and MOF. Inability to secure cooperation
from other departments not directly involved in implementation thus thwarted
project objectives.
19.      The establishment of experimental road sections for pavement
research was also delayed. Its purpose was to test different pavement design
and materials under varying local conditions and to develop appropriate
designs.   Four test sites were originally planned in June 1982.  This was
quickly scaled back in November to one section that would be constructed on
the Ankara-Eskisehir highway. The Bank recommended that specialists from the
Transportation and Road Research Laboratory (TRRL-U.K.) be engaged to assist.
The Bank and TRRL prepared an options paper on pavement research in October
1983, but KGM was not receptive however, and preferred to continue with its
plan to construct 36 test sections of 50m each at one site on the Ankara-
Eskisehir highway. It planned to complete this during 1984 by force account.
The Bank agreed to finance these works and provided technical assistance
through TRRL. The Eskisehir test sections were finally completed as part of
the Second Highway Project in the summer of 1987, and are currently being
monitored by KGM's technical research department for performance under
traffic.   There was little formal progress in the implementation of a new
planning system. Although everything required was done for implementing
specific project-financed works, and though new techniques were learned in KGM
(para. 13), it would not be correct to say that any major change took place in
KGM's planning procedures generally, as a result of the project. The eventual
aim of this work is to provide input to a KGM-wide pavement management system
(PMS). KGM's Planning Division is gathering inventory data, traffic and
loading data, and its staff are becoming conversant with the operation and
data requirements of the Highway Design and Maintenance Standards Model III
software program, recently supplied by the Bank, and they are currently
discussing with supervision missions, the purchase under the second project of
PMS data gathering equipment-- deflectometers, bump integrator and the like.
Thus, though there has been no formal commitment by KGM senior management to
set up a PMS in any formal sense as a response to Bank reques.s, informal
contacts are beginning to produce the same result.
20.      During bilateral talks prior to Board Presentation it was understood
that the Kuwait Fund would finance US$70 million of the cost of the joint
project, with their financing going for clearly defined road rehabilitation
contract lengths. However Kuwait Fund finally made two loans to Turkey, Ln.
240 for Kuwaiti Dinars (KD) 5.5 million,(US$19.0) and in 1983 Ln. 268 for KD
5.0 million, (US$17.2 million). Disbursement details of Kuwait loans were not
available to Bank in preparing Part I of this report.

Project Results
21.      The project did achieve most of its specific objectives on physical
works. Priority sections of the Trans Turkey highway amounting to 967 km (of
which 297km were financed by Kuwait Fund and 667km by IBRD) were rehabilitated
and strengthened. Computerization of project monitoring and introduction of
methodologies for evaluating economic and technical viability of all sub-
projects proposed in the 5-Year Plan indeed also went beyond the planning and
control objectives foreseen at the time of appraisal. Studies completed on
safety and axle load monitoring were delayed, but ultimately have also enabled
the government to establish suitable programs in these areas. The long term
impact of these studies on highway safety and optimizing use of transport
infrastructure should be high. KGM has been constructing crash barriers,
posting signs, and carrying out training activities to improve highway safety
throughout the implementation period. These engineering measures have shown a
major reduction in the aggregate lengths of road considered "critical", but
nevertheless accidents have continued to increase nationally. Road Safety
requires in addition to engineering, a matching effort in education and
enforcement currently being pursued as part of the Bank's transport dialogue.
Axle load monitoring and control is now institutionalized in Turkey--the next
stage will be to ensure that the incidence of user charges fully reflect the
costs imposed by various classes of vehicles. Completion of the study
comparing present and optimal user charges is a necessary step in this regard,
and is expected by late 1989. The benefits of the pavement research program
on improved highway design and maintenance costs can only be expected after 5-
10 years.
22.        The training objective was also met through a well-conceived and
implemented series of seminars held in the U.K. The 89 senior engineers and
staff benefitted from a total of nine courses in highway design, construction,
maintenance, fleet management/spare parts control and other management courses
and site visits that took place in the U.K. The results of the program were
very satisfactory according to participants and KGM.
Economic Re-evaluation
23.      The economic analysis of the project roads was based on a estimated
general traffic growth rate of 5X p.a. Between 1981 and 1987, traffic growth
on various sections ranged from 8 to 10 p.a. (see Table 4). Vehicle
operating cost savings were estimated to make-up 98% of the project benefits.
Economic .ates of return (ERR) were recalculated by KGM for three typical
sections; on the same basis as the original estimates:

24.      The project also had a positive impact on the Bank's macroeconomic
objective of fostering trade. Exports to Iraq, as measured by the number of
crossings at the Habur( Iraq) border, have increased from 2250 commercial
vehicles per day in 1982 to 3837 in 1987. Although it is not claimed that all
goods moved by road, gross exports to Iraq rose (in value) from $134.8 million
in 1980 to $945.3 million in 1987. They have fallen somewhat in 1988, as
Turkey limited the issue of letters of credit in favor of Iraq, because of
non-payment of arrears. The impact on poverty has not been determined, but
this was not an explicit objective of the project.   It should be noted,
however, that major portions of the highway financed by the Bank loan are in
the most economically depressed regions of Turkey. It is reasonable to assume
that the investments will contribute to an acceleration of economic activities
in these areas and particularly of the massive Southeastern Anatolia Region
Development Project, (GAP) which is currently underway.
Project Sustainability
25.      The project is likely to maintain an acceptable flow of net benefits
throughout its economic life. Important factors in this regard are whether
the government will continue to provide adequate funds for maintenance, will
ensure optimal use of resources through user charges, and whether Turkey will
continue its strategy of export-led growth. A related short-term factor will
be the impact on export demand and projected traffic growth from the cessation
of hostilities between Iran and Iraq. There was a lull in Iraq traffic at the
height of the war, but over the period 1985-87 traffic still increased by 15X.
This lull is not, however, expected to continue since economic recovery in
both countries and the consequent reconstruction needs that will arise should
contribute to continued buoyancy in the demand for Turkish exports.
26.      An important institutional objective was met when methodologies
adopted by the PT for evaluating technical and economic viability of
rehabilitation works financed through the IBRD loan were adopted throughout
KGM for investments proposed in the 1983-88 Plan. This was a major step
forward and should help to maintain an underlying objective of the project-
that of ensuring that highway rehabilitation funds are invested to maximize
economic benefits. Under the Second Highway Project this process is being
taken a step further with the introduction of HDM3 into KGM's Planning
Department, for program evaluation.
Bank Performance
27.      Bank performance was conscientious in the preparation and
supervision of the project.   During the preparation period there were eleven
directors-general of Highways and frequent changes of government. Following
appraisal, stability returned and with it good cooperation and speedy
implementation.  The phasing of supervision was timely (see Table 7).   Early
supervision appears to have been an important means of ensuring that the
project began on a solid foundation. Subsequent supervision during the first
21 months was carried out with greater frequency (4 months) than later
missions, which were undertaken at 6 months intervals.  The later missions



combined supervision of the first with preparation of the Second Highway
Project. Teams were also well balanced, with transportation engineers and
other specialists examining technical progress and economists concerned with
the efficiency issues.
28.      One area where Bank might have acted more forcefully was in urging
the government to complete the safety and axle load studies according to the
original schedule by employing outside consultants despite the latter's
reluctance. Turkey's reluctance to employ consultants is a problem common to
many projects in Turkey. Compliance on the safety study was ultimately
ensured only through negotiations on the next operation, despite the fact that
both studies were included in loan covenants for the Highway Rehabilitation
Project. The Bank was also not successful in getting KGM to complete the
study comparing optimal user charges with prevailing charges. Eventually
under the follow-on project, KGM has completed its work on determining what
road use charge should be levied to compensate the highway authority for
expense incurred by the passage of a vehicle, but the lack of inter-
departmental co-operation prevented KGM until recently from getting data on
revenues actually being collected, and thus ultimately determining whether the
existing charges are equitable.
Borrower Performance
29.      Most civil works were implemented according to schedule, despite
design changes and the vagaries of weather. When these factors caused slow-
downs, government acted quickly to arrange advance payments to contractors to
allow greater capital intensity and completion on schedule. Indeed, the
design changes, forced as a result of axle load legislation and higher traffic
growth, indicate a growing capacity within KGM to monitor and control for such
variables and willingness to adjust highway design specifications when
appropriate.   Technical supervision of the project by the borrower was
strong, and contracts and procurement were handled well. The requirement to
employ consultants to assist with certain studies was only partially complied
with.  KGM delayed considerably  in employing consultants on safety and axle
load studies. Table 6 shows a list of the studies undertaken and the outcome.
KGM acted responsibly in deploying necessary internal staff for the project.
Reporting was regular, but focussed exclusively on physical achievements or
variances,with no analysis or narrative to explain the causes of such
variances. The only area of non-compliance with the conditions of the Loan
Agreement is that KGM has thus far has not been willing to prepare Part II of
the PCR.



- 12 -
Project Relationships
30.      The cooperation between the Bank and KGM was excellent throughout
the project, where construction and equipment procurement were concerned. The
only area of outright disagreement related to KGM's reluctance to engage
consultants to assist in certain tasks (para. 17). Throughout the project,
however, there was resistance to the idea that the Bank had any role to play
in influencing purely policy matters. Although KG) gave the impression that
its actions in connection with policy matters -road safety, axle load control,
pavement research- were .ot done to comply with loan conditions, it is
important to note that acceptable action has been taken, and except as
explained above, all loan covenants were complied with.
Compliance with Covenants
31.    . With the exception of the PCR noted in para. 29, all covenants were
complied with.
Consulting Services
32.      KGM is a highly skilled organization capable of handling the bulk of
analytical and technical requirements of investment without outside consulting
assistance. The reluctance of KGM to utilize consultants is based on
confidence in their own ability to carry out most types of analysis, rather
than lack of funds. Divisional offices of KGM are responsible for most
engineering with the central office exercising overall supervision.
Consultants were thus not used for this phase of the project. KGM field
offices supervised construction. Most of the studies including axle loading
and safety planned at appraisal were also to be undertaken by KGM itself with
consultants limited to unidentified supplementary studies. Consultants were
therefore expected by KGM's staff to play a very minor role in this project.
As the complexity of axle loading and safety studies became more apparent and
constraints on necessary staff expertise arose, use of consultants increased
though delays occurred when KGM was reluctant to accept thi.i conclusion.
After adopting Bank recommendations on engaging outside expertise, consultants
ultimately made valuable contributions to the axle load and safety studies
begun by KGM and in establishing the pavement research program.  A consultant
was also brought in at a critical juncture in the development of the overseas
training program and performed well. Likewise, consultants were used with
satisfactory results in the equipment use/spare parts study, and other
supplementary studies including one related to constructior. of the Bosphorous
Bridge.
Project Documentation and Data
33.      The legal agreement and the appraisal report provided a useful and
realistic framework for implementation. Data to complete the PCR were readily
available in the project files, Management Information System and the Time
Recording System. Supervision reports were also satisfactory and provided the
most critical information regarding the implementation process. Narrative



- 13 -
portions of quarterly and annual reports submitted by the borrower were not
very helpful,(see para. 29), but audit reports were satisfactory and timely.
In general, handling of disbursements was well done and on time.
Findings and Lessons
34.      This report shows that the project was mostly successful in
achieving its physical targets, though two contracts were completed using
funds from the follow-on project. There was also considerable progress made
in introducing improved methods of project preparation which have already
produced as a further benefit a quick and smooth preparation of the follow on
project. It is clear that the Turkish Government is a good partner in
implementing the "hardware" elements of a project. It was more difficult to
get the Borrower's cooperation for the studies and policy elements of the
project, and the lesson to be learned is that preparation should have been
more advanced before Board preparation. In particular, TOR's, shortlists, and
consultant proposals for studies should have been cleared during the
preparation stage.

PART II
JECT REVIW  FROM BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
The Bank extended the due date for the PCR from December 1987 to March 1989 to
enable KGM to complete work on the final two highway sections that were being
completed with Second Highway Project funds. Despite this postponement, KGK
did not prepare a Part II, and recently advised the Bank that it would not do
so. A severe constraint on English-speaking staff was suggested as a reason.
The lack of an input from the Borrower is regrettable, particularly given the
generally satisfactory record of the project.
