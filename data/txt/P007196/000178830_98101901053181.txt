1. PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:               Instituto Nacional de Electrificacion (INDE)
Guarantor:              Republic of Guatemala
Executing Agencies:    Instituto Nacional de Electrificacion (INDE)
Empresa Electrica de Guatemala, S.A. (EEG)
Amount:                 US$81.0 million
Terms:                  Repayment in 15 years, including 5 years of grace,
with interest at the Bank standard variable rate.
Relending Terms:        INDE would transfer US$35.0 million equivalent of the
proceeds of the loan to a trust fund which would
onlend to EEG on the same terms and conditions of the
loan. EEG would bear the foreign exchange and
interest risks.
Project Objectives:    The Project would serve to:  (i) expand and improve
the subtransmission and distribution systems in the
areas served by EEG; (ii) improve the operating
reliability of INDE's system and the efficiency of
INDE's operations; and (iii) complete the necessary
studies to ensure that a decision on the next power
generation expansion can be based on consideration
of all available options. The project would also seek
to improve the efficiency of the sector through: (i)
the implementation of personnel, tariff and accounting
measures in INDE; (ii) reductions in INDE's workforce,
as efficiency improvements are achieved; (iii)
improved coordination between INDE and EEG; and (iv)
training of INDE's and EEG's staff.
Project Description:   The project consists of the following components:
(i) a slice of EEG's subtransmission and distribution
expansion for the period 1987-93 including a rural
electrification program; (ii) INDE's construction and
equipping of a National Control Center of the
country's electric power system and expansion of the
communication systems; (iii) rehabilitation of INDE's
two steam units at Escuintla; (iv) completion of
INDE's studies for the Chulac and Xalala hydro
projects; (v) acquisition by INDE of vehicles,
laboratory instrumentation and a digital computer with
peripherals and software; (vi) INDE's and EEG's staff
four-year training program; and (vii) technical
assistance to INDE in the financial, planning and
administrative areas.
Benefits and Risks:    The proposed project would help improve the power
sector's efficiency and would allow meeting minimum
system expansion requirements consistent with present
load growth expectations. The project faces no major



- ii -
physical risks and entails no detrimental
environmental effects. Implementation of tariff
increases, and staff restructuring and reductions
sought under the project might be delayed, should the
present wide political support to the newly elected
Government become weaker. Project execution may also
be affected if the Government is unable to move as
quickly as planned in carrying out its economic
adjustment efforts.

2. THE ENERGY SECTOR
Energy Consumption and Resources.
2.01      Gross energy consumption in Guatemala is low, equivalent to 0.47
tons of oil equivalent per capita, which is about 10 percent below the
Central American average. In 1984, the industrial sector accounted for
about 20 percent of total consumption, transportation for 13 percent, the
residential and commercial sectors for 66 percent, and agriculture for the
remaining 1 percent. While petroleum and hydrologic resources have been
growing in importance, they only accounted for 3 percent and 24 percent of
consumption respectively in 1984. A high proportion of total energy,
estimated at 71 percent in 1984, is still derived from wood and bagasse.
Forest resources are important, but may be depleted by the turn of the
century unless other energy resources are developed and the Government's
programs of reforestation are carried out.
2.02      Domestic production of crude oil averaged 4,900 barrels per day
in 1981-85, and covered only about 20 percent of domestic consumption.
Proven reserves are estimated at about 9 million barrels, equivalent to one
year of consumption. The Government plans to step up exploration of
extensive areas of potentially rich oil-bearing strata which are still
unexplored. The domestic price of gasoline (Q2.92-3.10 equivalent to
US$1.17-1.24 per gallon) and diesel oil (Q1.70 equivalent to US$0.68 per
gallon) are in line with international prices.
2.03      Natural gas is flared at oil fields at a rate of about 1.5 million
m3 per month, and is being considered for electricity generation. Geothermal
potential for electricity production has been explored in the past with
limited success. So far, only a 15 MW installation, at Ztnil, has been
proven feasible; it is scheduled for commissioning in 199]L. Exploration
continues and a number of pre-feasibility studies for other projects are
under way.
2.04      The country has a large, technically exploitable hydroelectric
potential which is estimated at about 5000 MW, or six times the present
installed capacity. Although the number of residential consumers increased
at about 7.4 percent p.a. from 1979 to 1985, i.e., well above the population
growth rate (2.9 percent), only 28 percent of the total population received
electricity service at the end of the period, compared wilth 36 percent in El
Salvador, 45 percent in Nicaragua, and 79 percent in Costa Rica. Electricity
consumption per capita, estimated at 156 kWh, also is low by Central American
standards. The Government is aware that electricity must be made available
to a greater proportion of the population, and has a number of rural
electrification programs to meet this objective. The proposed project
addresses this issue through the expansion of the distribution network
(para. 2.14).
Sector Organization and Coordination
2.05      Public electricity service is provided by INDE, EEG and ten small
municipal utilities. INDE was created in 1959 as a government-owned
institution responsible for power generation and transmission, rural
electrification, the supply of bulk electricity, and retail distribution
outside the area of the capital city. EEG, a former subsidiary of Boise



Cascade (USA), became a mixed public and private enterprise in 1977, with
92% of its shares owned by the Government and the remainder by private
shareholders.
2.06      Till the early 1980's, lack of coordination and institutional
weakness of INDE have been a major problem in the energy sector. EEG
operated thermal generation and electricity distribution in Guatemala city
and its environs, i.e. the most profitable portion of the market, with
sales concentrated in a small area comprising most industrial and high
income users. As a result, a significant part of the sector's financial
resources was generated by EEG. Because of resistance by EEG, INDE was for
many years unable to obtain a share of the sector's cash generation in
accordance with its investment needs to meet the required expansion of
generation capacity and provision of service to remote, low income rural
areas. As a result, installation of new generation capacity did not always
keep pace with growing needs, and there have been periods of service
interruptions.
2.07      Over the last five years, the Government has taken a number of
significant steps to improve coordination and develop INDE's institutional
capacity. First, a Ministry of Energy and Mines (MEM) was created in 1983
to formulate the country's energy policies, coordinate planning activities,
and take executive responsibilities for the development of hydrocarbons.
Second, the Government transferred to INDE its shares in EEG, completed a
number of studies to strengthen INDE, increased its planning capacity,
nominated the same President for INDE and EEG, and created a joint INDE-EEG
committee to coordinate the system's operation.   Lastly, the Government
established in 1985 a commission presided over by the Ministry of Energy and
Mines and comprising the Minister of Economy, the Secretary General of
Planning, and the President of INDE to formulate policies for the power
sector, including development strategy, investment plans, and tariffs. The
responsibility for overall supervision of INDE was shifted from the Ministry
of Communications, Transport and Public Works to MEM.
Power Sector Development Plan
2.08      The power sector investment program for 1987-93 totals US$516
million at May 1986 prices. It aims at keeping expansion to the minimum
compatible with ensuring that the expected load growth can be met with an
appropriate level of reliability. About 58 percent of the program is for
overdue investments in transmission (including interconnection with El
Salvador and Honduras), distribution, system communications and control, and
planning studies; 42 percent is for generation, including construction of a
68 MW (Santa Maria II) hydropower project, and two geothermal plants (Zunil
I, 15 MW, and Zunil II, 55 MW) and the rehabilitation of the 86 MW Escuintla
steam units (Annex 3.5, paras. 6 - 19). The program includes a rural
electrification component, aiming at increasing by 40 percent the number of
rural consumers. The proposed project is an integral patt of this program.
2.09      INDE has about one and a half years to complete feasibility
studies of hydropower, geothermal and natural gas projects, to analyze
generation alternatives, and to prepare new generation and transmission
programs (Annex 3.5, paras. 13, 18 and 19). During negotiations, INDE agreed
to (i) engage by March 31, 1987, consultants for the updating and completion



- 3 -
of the feasibility studies of two large and complex hydroelectric projects,
Chulac (440MW) and Xalala (360 MW), under terms of reference which would be
submitted for the Bank's review no later than October 31, 1986; (ii) complete
by December 31, 1987, the other feasibility studies required for updating the
sector's Master Plan for generation/transmission; and (iii) submit such
expansion program, based on a least-cost analysis of alternatives, to the
Bank by March 31, 1988. The proposed loan would finance the necessary
hydrogeological investigations and studies for Chulac and Xalala.
Bank Participation in the Power Sector
2.10      The Bank has supported the development of the Power Sector in
Guatemala since 1967, through four loans to INDE totalling US$193.6
million.  A project performance audit report prepared by the Operations
Evaluation Department on the First Power Project (Loan 487-GU, 60 MW
Jurun-Marinala Hydroelectric Project) and the Second Power Project (Loan
545-GU, Thermal Power Project) was distributed to the Executive Directors
on February 14, 1985 (Report no. 625). A review of the power sector was
carried out in August 1975. The main conclusions of these reports were
that, although the Bank had played a large part in the expansion of
Guatemala's power supply and in helping to establish INDE as the main
institution in the power sector, it could have contributed, more to the
solution of the two most serious problems - the sector's poor financial
performance arising mainly from the unsatisfactory arrange!ments between
INDE and EEG, and the lack of development of the country's hydroelectric
resources. Accordingly, Bank assistance was designed to address both these
problems through the financing of the Aguacapa Hydropower Project (Loan
1426-GU) and Chixoy Hydropower Project (Loan 1605-GU).
2.11      Through the construction of the Aguacapa Project: (90MW,
commissioned in 1981) and the Chixoy Project (300 MW, comnissioned in
January 1986), the Bank assisted the country in doubling its installed
capacity to 867 MW, and in transforming a generation system 80% dependent
on oil into one totally relying on hydropower. As a result, fuel
consumption for electricity generation is expected to be negligible in
1986, with savings of about 1.8 million barrels compared with 1985,
representing one-fourth of Guatemala's total oil consumptiLon.
2.12      In addition to promoting the coordination measures described
above in para 2.07, the Bank also played a key role in: (i) stopping
construction in 1982 of the insufficiently studied, large size Chulac
Hydropower Project; (ii) preventing the premature start of another
hydropower project, the Sta. Maria II; and (iii) shifting the
responsibility of the Chulac project to INDE and eliminatLng an "ad hoc"
unnecessary entity (HIDROCHULAC). As regards the approprLate sharing of
the sector's cash generation between INDE and EEG to help finance the
respective investment needs, INDE's bulk sale rates to ERG were increased
by 20% in February 1985, in accordance with Section 5.05 of Loan Agreement
1605-GU, which provides for tariff levels adequate to result in a transfer
from EEG to INDE of the funds available to EEG which are Ln excess of its
requirements for operations, repayment of debt, net working capital, and
capital expenditures.



-4-
2.13      Since the expansion of efficient electricity services is
essential for the development of industry and services in Guatemala, to
promote an expansion of production and exports, there is a clear need for
further institutional improvements in the organizational, technical,
administrative and financial arrangements for the sector. To achieve these
objectives, the Government needs to continue efforts to (i) ste-igthen INDE's
capacity, to plan and execute investment programs effectively and generate an
adequate share of its investment needs, thus enabling it to play a leading
role in the sector; and (ii) increase the sector's efficiency by specializing
the functions of INDE in power generation and transmission, and those of EEG
in distribution over the whole national territory, including rural
electrification.
2.14      The proposed project is the first to include EEG and would seek
to promote closer coordination between INDE and EEG. It would also
initiate EEG in the field of rural electrification. The proposed project
is designed to make further substantial progress in strengthening the
institutional framework of the sector by: (a) improving coordination, staff
skills and tariff structure; (b) improving operational efficiency and
productivity of the sector through the reduction of system losses and the
increased reliability of power supply; (c) strengthening the planning of
generation expansion; and (d) increasing the availability of electricity
services through expansion of the distribution.
2.15      As regards sector coordination, INDE and EEG agreed during
negotiations to take measures satisfactory to the Bank for the coordination
in planning, operation and investment financing of their respective systems.
These measures include that INDE will exercise its right to designate its own
President and Board of Directors for the election to the same position in
EEG. The Plan of Action (Annex 3.1) provides for the creation by December
31, 1986 of joint INDE-EEG committees for the planning of supply points,
preparation of demand projections, and programming of transmission lines and
substations.
2.16      The new Minister of Energy and Mines -  a former manager of INDE
and private entrepreneur - recognizes that other adjustments will
subsequently be required to improve the functioning of the sector and further
strengthen the institutional capacity of INDE as the entity responsible for
the coordination and expansion of electricity services. These adjustments
would entail a complete restructuring of responsibilities between INDE and
EEG for electricity generation and transmission, on one side, and
distribution, on the other. At the Government's request, the Bank is
considering assistance for this effort under a subsequent loan.
3. THE PROJECT
Background
3.01      The project was identified in February 1981, was prepared by INDE
and EEG with the assistance of consultants, and was appraised in October
1982 and post appraised in May/June 1983. Further processing was
interrupted, pending the introduction of economic stabilization measures,
and was resumed through an updating of the appraisal in June 1985, and a



- 5 -
confirmation of the sector's priorities by the newly elected authorities in
February, 1986. Negotiations were held in Washington from May 12 to 16,
1986. The Guatemalan delegation was led by Mr. Guillermo Salazar, Director,
Ministry of Finance.
Project Objectives
3.02      The main project objectives are:
(a)  to improve the efficiency of the power sector by (i) training
management and professional staff; (ii) providing technical
assistance to INDE for the implementation of measures recommended
by existing studies in the financial, administrcative and planning
areas; (iii) improving the coordination between INDE and EEG and
promoting the distribution of cash generated in the sector in a way
appropriate to address INDE's and EEG's respective investment
needs; (iv) gradually increasing the consumer/iemployee ratio in
INDE; and (v) improving the mobilization of domestic resources
through rationalization of tariff structures;
(b)  to improve the operating reliability of the INDE system by:
(i) rehabilitating the Escuintla steam plant to assure an
appropriate back-up to the hydropower generation system;
(ii) building and equipping a National Control Center and related
communications system to provide a safe and economic operation of
the system; (iii) providing specialized maintenance vehicles to
improve preventive maintenance and reduce service restoration
times; (v) acquiring instrumentation for an electronics laboratory
to expedite checking and repair of electrical components of the
protection, supervision, control and communications system;
(c)  to help prepare the generation expansion program by carrying out
the investigations and studies still needed to determine the
feasibility of the Chulac and Xalala projects;
(d)  to expand the subtransmission and primary and secondary
distribution systems of EEG to (i) meet the demand for 1988-1993
with the hydropower energy already available; (ii) improve the
reliability of the distribution system; and (iii) connect new
consumers to the grid, including rural areas.
3.03      To achieve the institutional objectives indicated above, during
negotiations: (1) INDE and EEG agreed to: (i) implement the "Plan of Action
for Institutional Development" including the tasks and schedule presented in
Annex 3.1; and (ii) submit to the Bank through INDE by November 30 of each
year, a progress report on such Plan of Action; and (2) the Government agreed
to enable INDE and EEG to comply with the above provisions.
Project Description
3.04      The Project comprises the following components:



-6-
(a)    EEG
- erection of 62 km of 69 kV lines and 87 MVA of 69/13.8 kV power
transformers; 960 km of 13.2 kV primary and secondary distribution
lines and 85 MVA of distribution transformers;
- acquisition of meters, protection equipment, switching equipment
and public lighting accessories; 100 operating and maintenance
vechicles; and a communications system between EEG's control center
and the major company facilities;
- implementation of a rural electrification program including 180
villages and 13,000 households, through construction of about 870
km of 13.2 kV primary and secondary lines, 8.5 MVA of distribution
transformers;
- implementation of a four-year staff training program;
(b) INDE
- construction and equipping of a National Control Center and
expansion of the related communications systems;
- rehabilitation of two steam units at the Escuintla thermal plant;
- acquisition of 90 operation and maintenance vehicles,
instrumentation for an electronic laboratory, and a digital
computer with peripherals and software;
- additional geological investigations and completion of the
feasibility study for the Chulac Hydroelectric Project, and
completion of the feasibility study for the Xalala hydroelectric
project.
Project Cost
3.05      The estimated total cost of the proposed project, including price
and physical contingencies, duties, and taxes, is US$108.0 million
equivalent, of which US$74.8 million equivalent (69%) are foreign costs. A
table at the beginning of this report shows the breakdown by project
components. Duties and taxes have been estimated at US$5.9 million. Total
financing requirements, including financing charges (US$25.2 million
equivalent), are estimated at US$133.2 million equivalent, of which US$100.0
million equivalent would be in foreign exchange. Project component costs
are based on detailed estimates at January 1985 prices and have been adjusted
to May 1986 price levels. Consultant services have been estimated at 80
staff-months for the review and completion of the Xalala and Chulac studies,
10 staff-months for the review of thermal plan rehabilitation requirements,
80 staff-months for the supervision of the dispatch center and communication
system construction, and 290 staff-months for training and technical
assistance. Physical contingencies amount to 10.4% of the project base
cost. They have been calculated, on the basis of experience with similar
projects, at 10 percent of base costs for all components, including
distribution, except for thermal plant rehabilitation (20 percent),
hydrogeological investigations of project studies (15%), subtransmission (5
per cent) and training and technical assistance (0 per cent). Price
contingencies for foreign and domestic costs have been calculated at about 7
percent annually for 1986-90 and 4 percent thereafter. Total price
contingencies amount to 23 percent of base cost including physical
contingencies.



-7-
Financing Plan
3.06      The Bank would finance: (i) US$71.5 million of the project cost,
representing nearly 96 percent of the total foreign cost; and (ii) US$9.5
million of financial charges maturing before June 30, 1990, to alleviate the
sector's already heavy servicing requirements arising from the external debt
contracted for the financing of the large hydropower projects built in the
past years. Since INDE is not authorized to onlend funds, INDE would
transfer US$35.0 million equivalent of the proceeds of the loan to a trust
fund which would onlend to EEG on the same terms and conditions of the loan.
The signing of the trust fund agreement would be a condition of loan
effectiveness. EEG would bear the foreign exchange and interest rate risk.
INDE and EEG would finance the local costs (US$33.2 million equivalent) and
US$19.0 million of foreign exchange financing requirements from internally
generated cash.
Project Implementation
3.07      The Project would start in June 1986 and would be completed by
December 1993. All the engineering required for the distribution and rural
electrification works will be provided by EEG, which has adequate expertise.
Distribution works, exclusive of the expansion of new primary circuits, will
be carried out by force account by EEG, which has handled satisfactorily a
similar volume of works during the last few years. Construction of the 69 kV
lines and of new primary circuits will be carried out by local contractors
which have experience in this kind of work. A feasibility study for the
National Control Center and associated communications was completed in
January, 1986. During negotiations, INDE agreed to hire consultants for the
supervision of the construction and equipping of the Control Center and the
associated communications system by September 30, 1987. Terms of reference
should be submitted for the Bank's review no later than March 31, 1987.
Terms of reference for hiring consultant will be submitted to the Bank (i) no
later than October 31, 1986, for the execution of the Cb,ulac and Xalala
studies (para. 2.09); and (ii) no later than July 31, 1986, for consultant
services in the financial, planning and administrative areas (para. 3.12). A
thermal rehabilitation assessment is expected to be completed by independent
consultants under an existing IDB loan, and is expected to be submitted to
the Bank by September 30, 1986. A detailed four-year plan for the training
needs would be prepared by consultants by April 30, 1987 (para. 3.12).
The Market 1/
3.08      Total electricity demand started increasing slowly in 1983, after a
modest decrease in 1980-82 due to declining economic activity and private
investment. Total consumption thus recovered in 1985 to' 1243 GWh,
approximately equal to the 1979 level. While residential and commercial
consumption kept growing during this period, industrial consumption only
recovered to a modest level of growth in 1984-85 (3.5 percent p.a. after a
drop of 9.8 percent p.a. in 1980-83). Based on prospects for economic
recovery assisted by the stabilization and adjustment policies of the new
1/   See Annex 3.5 for further details on the power market.



- 8 -
Government, consumption is projected to reach about 2,120 GWh in 1993, with
an annual average growth of 6.6%, well below the rate in 1971-79 (10% p.a.).
There are no prospects of substantive demand from neighboring countries, as
the two countries which will be interconnected, El Salvador and Honduras,
will only need energy interchanges during emergency periods.
3.09      Electricity losses in the interconnected system have been high
during the last four years--an average of 16.9% of net generation--both
because of the postponement of investments in distribution and inadequate
control of losses. The proposed project is expected to: (i) reduce from 15%
to 10% the losses of EEG; and (ii) achieve a better control of consumption
and sales through improved metering, billing and surveillance in INDE. Total
system losses would thus decrease to about 13% by 1990.
Executing Agencies
INDE
3.10      A new organizational framework for INDE was introduced in January
1986 taking into account studies financed under Bank loans (Annex 3.6,
attachment 1). INDE's seven-member Board is appointed by the Government.
The President and Vice-President are full time members with executive
functions. Their appointment is proposed by the Minister of Energy and
Mines. The other members are representatives of this Ministry as well as the
Ministries of Communications, Transport, and Public Works; Finance; and
Economy; and of the General Secretariat of Planning. The current President
and Vice-President have long experience in the power sector and have held top
management positions in EEG in the past.
3.11      INDE currently has about 7,600 employees (including 230
professionals). This staff level is excessive, since it results in a ratio
of 25 consumers per employee compared with 60 to 80 per employee for
utilities in most developing countries which is adequate. To address this
situation, during negotiations: (1) INDE agreed to: (i) submit, no later than
September 30, 1986, a five-year program of staff restructuring and reduction,
establishing targets acceptable to the Bank, for increasing the ratio of
consumers to employee to not less than 40 by December 31, 1987, and not less
than 75 by December 31, 1991; and (ii) promptly carry out the program,
taking into consideration the Bank's comments; and (2) the Government agreed
to enable INDE to comply with the above provisions.
3.12      INDE's staff is subject to Guatemalan civil service regulations,
which limit salary levels. As a result, INDE lacks qualified staff, notably
in the financial and administrative areas, and in the intermediate management
levels, since the private sector offers better salaries and work conditions.
The Plan of Action (Annex 3.1) provides for the exclusion of INDE's staff
from the Guatemalan civil service regulations, and the revision of INDE's
salary levels and personnel regulations no later than June 1987. During
negotiations INDE agreed to: (i) engage consultants no later than October 31,
1986, under terms of reference to be submitted to the Bank's review no later
than July 31, 1986, to work directly with INDE's staff in key positions and
advise on important day-to-day management problems, personnel administration,
finances, planning, internal control and management information systems; (ii)
engage consultants no later than October 31, 1986, to assist in the
preparation and implementation of a four-year staff training program under



terms of reference to be submitted to the Bank no later than July 31, 1986;
(iii) submit such program to the Bank by April 30, 1987; and (iv) prepare by
October 31 every year a detailed program of training activities for the
following year, taking into account the Bank's comments. The Plan of Action
provides for specific measures to improve the accounting system, budget
management, internal audit, and insurance management (Annexes 3.1 and 3.6).
External audit of INDE's accounts has been performed satisfactorily.  During
negotiations, INDE agreed to continue appointing independent auditors
acceptable to the Bank and to send to the Bank the audited financial
statements together with the auditor's reports within four months from the
end of each fiscal year.
EEG
3.13      EEG is an efficient, well managed and profit-oriented entity which
follows sound managerial practices and operates outside the civil service
regulations. EEG's shareholders elect a Board of Directors which, in turn,
selects the President and Vice-President of the company, and appoints the
General Manager. Under EEG's current organizational structure four managers
(Financial, Commercial, Administrative, and Operational) report directly to
the General Manager, as well as three staff units (Planning, Legal, and
Internal Auditor) and three regional agencies (Annex 3.6, Attachment 2).
Adequate delegation of responsibility permits an efficient: operation. EEG's
General Manager has wide experience in the Guatemalan power sector. All
other managers have worked for EEG for more than ten years and have acquired
managerial expertise under the former private owners of the company.
3.14      EEG employs 1,233 people (including about 50 professionals) and
plans to reach 1,600 in 1993. The ratio of consumers per employee is
excellent (225 in 1985; 231 in 1993). Since EEG staff is not subject to the
civil service regulations, adequate salary levels permit EEG to recruit and
retain well qualified personnel. EEG requires new equipment, technical
assistance and additional overseas training for its comprehensive staff
training programs. During negotiations, EEG agreed to: (iL) engage
consultants no later than October 31, 1986, to assist in the preparation and
implementation of a four-year training program under terms of reference to be
submitted to the Bank no later than July 31, 1986; (ii) submit such program
to the Bank by April 30, 1987; and (iii) present by October 31 every year a
detailed program of the training activities for the following year, taking
into account the Bank's comments. The "Plan of Action" provides for
improvement of EEG insurance coverage (Annexes 3.1 and 3.6).  During
negotiations, EEG agreed to appoint independent auditors acceptable to the
Bank and to send to the Bank the audited financial statements together with
the auditor's reports within four months from the end of each fiscal year.
Procurement
3.15      Procurement arrangements would be as follows:

IBRD Loans and IDA Credits", except for equipment estimated not to exceed
US$1,200,000 in total which would be procured through international shopping
(US$700,000 in contracts less than US$50,000 each) or direct purchase
(US$500,000) because of compatibility with existing equipment, or limited
number of suppliers which can meet the specifications. At the Government's
request, manufacturers of equipment and materials in member countries of the
Central American Common Market would have a margin of preference in bid
evaluation of 15 percent of the C.I.F. cost or half the amount of taxes on
the importation of such goods, whichever is lower. Regional manufacturers
are likely to participate in bids for conductors and concrete poles.
3.17      Construction of the exploration galleries required for field
investigations of the Chulac Hydroelectric Project, estimated not to exceed
about US$1.4 million equivalent, would be procured under local competitive
tendering open to the participation of foreign bidders. Construction of
EEG's subtransmission and distribution primary lines, and of INDE's building



- 11 -
of the National Control Center and communications facilities would be
contracted under EEG's and INDE's procurement procedures, which are
acceptable. For goods estimated to cost the equivalent of US$200,000 or more
the Bank would review and approve tender documents before they are issued.
For civil works, model bidding documents and contracts would be submitted to
the Bank before advertising and tendering. Contracts for goods above
US$200,000 and civil works would be awarded after Bank's review of the
borrower's bid evaluation report. Bank's prior review of procurement
documentation covers 100 per cent of the total estimated value of works
contracts and about 90 per cent of goods contracts. Consultants would be
selected and contracted in accordance with the "Guidelines for the use of
consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing
Agency.
Disbursements
3.18      Proceeds of the proposed loan would be disbursed for:
(a) 100% of foreign expenditures and 93% of ex-factory cost of local
expenditures for electrical, electronic, and mechanical equipment
and parts; material for distribution, subtransmission and
communication plant; transportation equipment; computer equipment;
(b) 100% of expenditures for consultant services for preinvestment
studies, dispatch center and communications construction
supervision, and technical assistance;
(c) 100% of foreign expenditures for training services;
(d) 100% of foreign expenditures for equipment instaLllation in the
dispatch center and communications system;
(e) 62% of total expenditures for construction of exploration galleries
related to preinvestment studies (representing the estimated
foreign cost component);
(f) 70% of total expenditures for contractor services for thermal plant
rehabilitation (representing the estimated foreign cost component);
(g) Financing charges accrued until June 30, 1990 up, to a total amount
of US$9.5 million.
3.19      The proposed loan would be disbursed over a period of seven and
half years, in accordance with the Bank's standard disbursement profile. The
Closing Date would be June 30, 1994. In order to facilitate disbursement, a
Special Account would be established in the Central Bank (Banco de Guatemala)
on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank. The initial deposit in the
Special Account would be US$4 million equivalent. Disbursement requests
would be fully documented, except for imported goods whose value is less than
US$100,000 equivalent which would be based on presentation. of a statement of
expenditures.

Financial Performance 2/
3.20      Between 1982 and 1984 the sector's financial position was burdened
by the cost overruns and completion delays of the Chixoy project, the
resulting need to continue to use fuel, and a 5 percent decrease in
electricity sales compared with the 1979/1981 period. Notwithstanding
electricity rates at the highest level in Central America (Annex 3.10), the
average contribution to investment was only 13%, and the sector had to rely
on government contributions (36%) and borrowings (51%) to finance large
investment expenditures (US$463 million).   The main burden fell on INDE,
which was able to contribute only about 5% to its large investment
expenditures (US$447 million) and had to step up its borrowing, so that its
debt service coverage decreased to 1.0. EEG financial position remained
strong. Internal cash generation allowed EEG to finance as in the previous
years all its working capital and investment requirements without significant
borrowing. Accounts receivable absorbed a large component of the working
capital, growing from US$24.1 million in 1982 to US$36.4 million in 1984,
equivalent to 107 days of billing. Most of this amount is owed to EEG by
municipalities and Government agencies, including about US$21.6 million owed
by the capital city's water supply company, EMPAGUA.
Financial Objectives 2/
3.21      The financial position of the sector is expected to strengthen in
1987-1993 because of two main factors.  First, the shift of the system from
thermal-based to hydropower generation would reduce the operating expenses
per kWh sold from US cents 9.3 in 1982-84 to US cents 7.7 in 1986. Fuel
expenses are expected to decrease to 3 percent of operating expenses in
1986-93, compared with 53 percent in 1982-84. Depreciation will increase
from 14 percent of operating expenses to 56 percent. Second, annual
investment requirements in 1987-93, (averaging US$113 million in current
prices, equivalent to US$74 million May 1986 prices) will be 54% lower than
in 1982-85 (US$145 million in May 1986 prices). Provided tariff levels are
kept at a level adequate to achieve a 5% rate of return, the sector would be
able to contribute about 62% of the financing requirements for investment
(US$810 million) and working capital (US$92 million), in addition to a
transfer of about US$93 million equivalent to the Government budget in
1989-93. The debt service coverage would be at satisfactory level (about 1.5
times). During negotiations, (1) INDE and EEG agreed, subject to the
provisions indicated in para. 3.22, (i) to set tariffs at such level as to
allow each utility to earn a rate of return not lower than 5 percent,
calculated on a rate base annually revalued; the covenant of Loan 1605-GU for
a rate of return of the sector (5% in 1986-1987; 6% in 1988; 7% in 1989; and
8% thereafter) would be superseded by this agreement; (ii) to present to the
Bank by September 30 of each year, starting in 1986, a schedule of tariff
adjustments for the following year to meet compliance with the 5% covepanted
rate of return; and (iii) to repeat the provision of Loan Agreement 1605-GU
requiring review of any capital expenditures in excess of US$5.0 million
which are not included in the investment program reviewed by the Bank; and
(2) the Government agreed to enable INDE and EEG to comply with the above
provisions. The Plan of Action (Annex 3.1) provides for the revaluation of
INDE's and EEG's assets.

3.22      Electricity tariffs have been increased in the past in accordance
with the increasing cost of fuel, and reached in 1984 Quetzales 12.6 cents/
kWh (equivalent to US cents 12.6/kWh) on the average, estimated to be 40
percent above the level of long-term marginal costs. Since then, however,
the Quetzal has significantly depreciated. The Government's ongoing process
of unification of exchange rates will require tariff increases. Based on the
assumption of an exchange rate for external debt servicing set at US$1 = Q2.5
starting in December 1987 (see Annex 3.9, para. 12), the current average
tariff in Quetzales of cents 12.6/KWh would have to be increased by about 22
percent in 1987 and by 48 percent in 1988 to achieve a 5 percent rate of
return. To avoid a sharp increase of 48% in January 1988, during
negotiations, INDE and EEG agreed to increase their average tariff to final
consumers every month during 1987, starting in January, so as to achieve a
reduction of their operating ratios to 49 percent and 92 percent respectively
in 1987 (Annex 3.9, attachment 1.4). This is expected to result in a rate of
return exceeding 5 percent in 1987. It was agreed, therefore, that INDE's
and EEG's net operating incomes in excess of what would have been required to
reach a 5 percent rate of return in 1987 would be taken into, account for the
calculation of the rate of return in 1988. With these increases, the average
level of tariffs would be in line with the long-term marginal costs. Bank
financed tariff study carried out in 1983 concluded that INDE's and EEG's
tariff structures are out of line with the structures of long-term marginal
costs valued at the new exchange rate. Accordingly, the Plan of Action
(Annex 3.1) provides for a review of the structure of electricity tariffs.
3.23      During negotiations: (i) the Government agreed to take all
necessary actions to ensure that by January 1, 1987, and at all times
thereafter, the accounts payable by public agencies to INDE and EEG shall
not exceed 60 days of billing; and (ii) INDE and EEG agreed to maintain a 66
day collection period for private consumers by December 31, 1986 and
thereafter.
3.24      During 1987-93, INDE will have by far the largest financing
requirements for investment and working capital: US$785 million, compared
with US$117 million for EEG. During the same period, EEG will have an
internal cash generation which is expected to be sufficient to finance about
37% of its investments and working capital requirements. Therefore, with the
objective of (i) sharing more equitably than in the past the! contribution to
the financing of investment in the sector; and (ii) using of EEG's yet
untapped capacity to borrow domestically and abroad, during negotiations:
(1) EEG agreed to: (i) pay annually starting in 1986 dividends equivalent to
the amount of its net income after taxes and provisions for legal reserves;
(ii) pay to INDE its electricity bill within 45 days; (iii) pay 50 percent of
dividends accrued up to 1985, by no later than January 1, 1987; and (iv)
gradually pay in 1987 and thereafter the balance of dividends accrued up to
1985; and (2) the Government, EMPAGUA and EEG would execute an agreement for
the settlement of EMPAGUA's arrears as a condition of loan effectiveness.



- 14 -
3.25      With the above measures, INDE's internal cash generation, after
transferring US$93 million to the Government budget and receiving EEG's
dividends, should allow INDE to finance 66 percent of its investment program
in 1987-93. During negotiations, INDE agreed to submit to the Bank by June
30, 1987 a set of procedures and criteria to regulate the transfer of funds
from INDE to the Government to ensure that such transfers do not impair
INDE's financial position or project execution. The existing covenant under
Loan 1605-GU on the debt service coverage ratio (1.5) would continue to apply
to INDE and would be extended to EEG.
Project Benefits and Justification
3.26      The proposed project would help improve the power sector's
efficiency and would enable minimum system expansion requirements to be met
consistent with present load growth expectations. The project is justified
as part of the least-cost expansion program of the sector's generation,
transmission and distribution systems. A measure of the minimum benefits
associated with these programs is given by the incremental sales revenue.
Based on valuing the latter at the average tariff resulting from the
covenanted financial rate of return, the rate of return for the project is
estimated to be 12 percent, which is at the upper end of the range of the
opportunity cost of capital in Guatemala (10-12 percent). The project,
however, is likely to generate additional social benefits accruing from
expanded residential and public use, as well as additional econonic benefits
accruing to production from a more reliable electricity supply. Sensitivity
analysis show that the minimum rate of return would be 10.9 percent in case
investment costs are 10 percent higher than now estimated.
Risks and Environmental Considerations
3.27      The project is not expected to have detrimental effects on the
environment and presents no major physical risks, since construction of
standard subtransmission, distribution and communication facilities are
involved. Delays in project execution could arise due to the following: (i)
EEG has no previous experience with Bank loans and procedures; and (ii) INDE
has no previous experience in the construction of a control center and
extensive communications systems. To minimize these risks, (i) a Bank
procurement specialist has discussed with EEG the Bank's guidelines for
procurement; and (ii) consultants would supervise the construction and
equipping of the control center and communication system (para. 3.07).
Implementation of staff restructuring and reductions, and tariff increases
sought under the project might be delayed, should the present significant
political support accorded to the newly elected Government weaken. Project
execution may also be affected if the Government is unable to move as quickly
as planned in carrying out its economic adjustment efforts.

4. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
4.01      During negotiations, agreement has been reached wLth the
Government, and/or INDE and/or EEG, as appropriate, that:
(a) Expansion Program. INDE would:(i) engage by Marclh 31, 1987,
consultants for the updating and completion of the feasibility studies for
two large and complex hydroelectric projects, Chulac (440 MW) and Xalala (360
MW), under terms of reference to be submitted to the Bank's review no later
than October 31, 1986; (ii) complete by December 31, 1987, the other
feasibility studies required for updating the sector's Master Plan for
generation/transmission; and (iii) submit such expansion program, based on a
least-cost analysis of alternatives, to the Bank by March 31, 1988
(para. 2.09).
(b) Management and Institutional Strengthening. (1) INDE and EEG
would: (i) take measures satisfactory to the Bank for the coordination in
planning, operation and investment financing of their respective systems.
These measures will include that INDE will exercise its right to designate
its own President and Board of Directors for the election to the same
positions in EEG (para. 2.15); (ii) implement a "Plan of Action for
Institutional Improvements" including the tasks and schedule presented in
Annex 3.1; (iii) submit to the Bank through INDE by November 30, of each
year, a progress report on the Plan of Action (para. 3.03); (2) the
Government would enable INDE and EEG to carry out their respective
obligations in the Plan of Action (para. 3.03); and (3) IND]E would engage
consultants no later than October 31, 1986, under terms of reference to be
submitted to Bank's review no later than July 31, 1986, to work directly with
INDE's key staff and advise on important day-to-day management problems,
personnel administration, finances, planning, internal control and management
information systems (para 3.12).
(c) Manpower. (1) INDE would: (i) submit no later than September
30,1986, a five-year program of staff restructuring and reduction,
establishing targets acceptable to the Bank, for Lncreasing the
ratio of consumers to employee to not less than 41) by December 31,
1987, and not less than 75 by December 31, 1991; and (ii) promptly
carry out the program, taking into consideration the Bank's
comments; and (2) the Government would enable INDE] to comply with
the above provisions (para. 3.11).
(d) Staff Training. INDE and EEG would: (i) engage consultants nolater
than October 31, 1986, to assist in the preparation and
implementation of a four-year training program, under terms of
reference to be submitted to the Bank, no later than July 31, 1986;
and (ii) submit such program to the Bank by April 30, 1987; and
(iii) prepare by October 31, every year a detailed program of
training activities for the following year, takingr into account the
comments of the Bank (paras. 3.12 and 3.14).



- 16 -
(e) Construction Supervision. INDE would hire consultants
for the supervision of the construction and equipping of the Control Center
and the associated communications system by September 30, 1987. Terms of
reference to be submitted for the Bank's review no later than March 31, 1987
(para. 3.07).
(f) Sector Arrears. (i) The Government would take all necessary
actions to ensure that by January 1, 1987, and at all times thereafter, the
accounts payable by public agencies to EEG and INDE shall not exceed 60 days
of billing (para. 3.23); (ii) INDE and EEG would maintain a 60 days
collection period for private consumers by December 31, 1986 and thereafter
(para. 3.23); and (iii) EEG would pay to INDE its electricity bill within 45
days (para. 3.24).
(g) Tariffs. (1) INDE and EEG would: (i) set tariffs at such level as
to allow each utility to earn a rate of return not lower than five
percent (5%), calculated on a rate base annually revalued; the covenant of
Loan 1605-GU for a rate of return of the sector (5% in 1986-1987; 6% in
1988; 7% in 1989 and 8% thereafter) would be superseded by this agreement
(para. 3.21); (ii) increase their tariff to final consumers every month
during 1987, starting in January, so as to achieve a reduction of their
operating ratios to 49 percent and 92 percent respectively in 1987. INDE's
and EEG's net operating incomes in excess of what would have been required to
reach a 5 percent rate of return in 1987 would be taken into account for the
calculation of the rate of return in 1988 (para. 3.22); and (iii) present to
the Bank's comments by September 30 of each year, starting in 1986, a
schedule of tariff adjustments for the following year to meet compliance with
the 5% covenanted rate of return (para. 3.21); and (2) The Government would
enable INDE and EEG to comply with the above provisions (para. 3.21).
(h) Dividends and Transfers of Funds. (1) INDE would submit to Bank's
consideration by June 30, 1987, a set of procedures and criteria to regulate
the transfer of funds from INDE to the Government to ensure that such
transfers do not impair INDE's financial position and project execution
(para. 3.25); and (2) EEG would: (i) pay annually, starting in 1986,
dividends equivalent to the amount of its net income after taxes and
provisions for legal reserves; (ii) pay 50 percent of dividends accrued up to
1985, by no later than January 1, 1987; and (iii) gradually pay in 1987 and
thereafter the balance of dividends accrued up to 1985 (para. 3.24).
4.02      The following main provisions of the Loan Agreement of Loan 1605-GU
would be maintained and extended to EEG as appropriate:
(a) Auditing and financing statements (paras. 3.12 and 3.14);
(b) Major project clause (para. 3.21);
(c) Debt-service coverage (para 3.25).

Conditions of Effectiveness
4.03      The following events have been agreed as condition of
effectiveness:
(a)  the establishment of a trust fund arrangement beitween INDE and EEG
satisfactory to the Bank (para. 3.06)
(b) the execution of a contract between the Governmenit, EEG and
EMPAGUA, satisfactory to the Bank, whereby EMPAGIJA shall undertake
to pay its outstanding debt to EEG (para. 3.23).
4.04      With actions taken and agreements reached as indicated above, the
proposed project would be a suitable basis for a loan of US$81 million
equivalent by the Bank to INDE to be repaid over a period of 15 years,
including five years of grace.

POWER DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
DESCRIPTION AND JUSTIFICATION OF THE PROJECT ELEMENTS
Distribution Program (EEG)
1.           EEG's distribution system comprises of: (i) a 69 kV system which
serves as a link between the high voltage substations (230 kV and 138 kV) and
the distribution substations (69 kV - 7.62/13.2 kV); (ii) a primary
distribution system, which is a four-wire 7620/13200 volts overhead system;
and (iii) a secondary distribution system, which is a 60 Hz 120/240 volts,
three-wire, single phase or 208/120 volts, four-wire, three-phase system.
The distribution system generally is designed and constructed to meet
standards satisfactory for local conditions. The quality of service is good
and its reliability adequate, although many circuits and transformers are
becoming overloaded. The works included in the Project for EEG's
distribution system are mainly related to: (i) system expansion to serve new
loads and to adapt the system to the bulk supply points related to the Chixoy
Hydroelectric Project; and (ii) system improvements in operation flexibility
(increased switching capabilities), voltage levels (capacitors, loading of
transformers and substations), and expansion flexibility (increased
transformer capacity and number of primary feeders). The distribution
program considered for EEG in the proposed Project is in fact a four-year
time slice of the EEG's original investment program expanded over
seven-and-a-half years to account for normal execution delays and reflect the
Bank's applicable disbursement profiles.
Rural Electrification Program (EEG)
2.           EEG supplies about 120 rural villages, even though it has given
no special consideration to the rural consumers under its expansion programs
of the last ten years. In 1983, EEG completed a survey of rural villages and
mid-size farms (fincas) on which basis a rural electrification program was
developed. Based on the estimated consumption per type of dwelling and
finca, dispersion of dwellings and fincas, existing infrastructure in the
villages (access roads, water, health center, school), and proximity of
existing lines, priority was established on the basis of a cost-benefit
analysis for the connection of new villages and fincas to the system and
extension of the supply to other consumers in already connected villages.
Details are given in reference B.10, Annex 3.12. The first phase of the
program to be funded by the proposed project, aims at connecting 88 new
villages and 47 new fincas and extend services in 92 villages. This would
require construction of about 870 km of new lines, out of which 470 km of



- 24 -
ANNEX 3.2
Page 2 of 5
13.2 kV primary lines (about 250 km single-phase, 210 km two-phase and 50 km
three-phase) and 400 km in secondary lines, and acquisition and installation
of 8,500 kVA of distribution transformers. It is estimated that 13,100 new
consumers will be connected, out of which some two-thirds are located in
areas not yet served. It is expected that a population of about 86,000
people will be benefited by this rural electrification program.
Vehicles (EEG)
3.           About 140 vehicles are now available for maintenance and
operation work in EEG, of which only about half are less than six years old.
Total number of vehicles is considered adequate to meet the requirements of
the system, but they have to be replaced gradually according to their service
life, which varies between 5 years for small pick-ups and panels to 10 years
for trucks and specialized vehicles. The Project includeEs procurement of
about 100 vehicles to replace worn-out equipment.
Training (EEG)
4.           Although EEG has a long-established training program, it is
necessary to strengthen it by providing overseas training for professional
staff, reviewing out-of-date or worn-out equipment, and resorting to
technical assistance for training instructors, updating teaching materials
and methodology, elaborating procedures and manuals. A four-year program will
be formulated as part of the proposed project with assistance from
consultants, to address those needs.
Chulac Studies (INDE)
5.           The Chulac Hydroelectric Project's initial design comprised a
163-meter high rockfill dam with an asphaltic-cement blanlket, and a total
installed capacity of 440 MW. In 1980 a consultant completed a feasibility
study for this project, but concluded that the conditions of the rock in the
right abutment of the dam site was poor and required further investigations.
Further in-site tests of the rock in this abutment indicat:ed that its
mechanic characteristics were very poor and a board of consultants that
examined available information on the project in mid-1982 concluded that this
rock is a poor foundation for a 163 m high dam in a high-earthquake risk
area, and that lowering the dam about 30 m should be considered to obtain a
satisfactory design. The board of consultants also recomnended to carry out
an investigation program, which is included as a componenit of the proposed
Project, consisting of about 640 m of exploration galleries, drill holes,
in-site and laboratory shear tests, and grouting tests.  The results of the
investigation program will be used to modify the preliminary design of the
project and prepare new cost estimates and energy studies to determine its
economic justification, for which about 40 man-months of consultant services
are included in the proposed project.

Xalala Studies (INDE)
6.           The Xalala Hydroelectric Project would be located on the Chixoy
River, about 42 km downstream from the Chixoy Hydro Project, and would
comprise a 95 m high rockfill dam, three power tunnels 330 m long, and a
powerhouse with 3 x 120 MW generating units. A feasibility study for this
project which was considered completed in 1980, concluded that the project
was economically attractive, indeed the most attractive of the hydro projects
studied at that time; however, a serious technical problem was detected: a
Karstic formation which surrounds the reservoir was not well understood and
additional investigations were required to establish the elevation at which
the reservoir's watertightness could be ensured. These investigations have
not been carried out yet, and are proposed now as a component of the Power
Distribution Project, as follows: drill holes for hydrogeological studies,
installation of a permanent seismic network, revision of the preliminary
design, cost estimates and economic justification; about 44 man-months of
consultant services are included to complete the feasibility study for this
project.
Dispatch Center and Communications (INDE)
7.           INDE does not have appropriate facilities to supervise,
coordinate and control the operation of the generation and transmission
system in the country. The power system is becoming complex (the Chixoy
Hydroelectric Plant and the electric interconnection with El Salvador will be
in operation by 1986 and 1987 respectively) and will require soon an adequate
control system to maintain a reliable, economic and good quality service. A
preliminary report on the functional requirements of the national dispatch
center and associated communications system were prepared by Harza
Engineering Co. in January 1985 and reviewed by the re-appraisal mission of
May 1985. The final feasibility report was completed in January 1986 and
includes, as discussed with that Bank's mission, the definition of a
priority stage of the dispatch center and communications facilities. Only
such a stage is considered as a project component. It covers the major
generating stations and substations and would consist basically of a
supervisory control and data acquisition system, an automatic generation
control function and a microwave/power line carrier system. The
feasibility report as issued includes the building layout and the
specifications of the hardware and software for the dispatch center and the
basic design features of the communications system. Harza is also going to
provide the tender documents for the equipment and services by May 31, 1986.
Rehabilitation of Thermal Plants (INDE)
8.           The availability of the Escuintla steam units is essential to
ensure a reliable supply to the interconnected system (Annex 3.5, para. 12).
Unit number one boiler exploded in the end of 1983 and the plant has not
operated ever since. Due to the extremely critical supply conditions
following the tunnel collapse of Chixoy, Escuintla unit number two operated

for about two years with virtually no stopping (although sometimes at a
derated capacity) until the recommissioning of Chixoy in early 1986. There
is an immediate need for a major overhaul of this unit. ENDE management has
accepted the risk of increasing the amount of damage to the unit to avoid a
power curtailment (or its dramatic increase as would have occurred in the
second quarter of 1985). The rehabilitation of unit I has been studied by
the manufacturer (AEG) and would include the whole boiler and parts of the
plant measurement and regulation system, turbine, exciter and voltage
regulator, and cooling tower. The actual repair needs for unit II will be
revealed by the time it is thoroughly inspected by specialists. An
assessment made by INDE's Operation Department is the basis for the estimate
used in this report. It would include partial repairs of the boiler,
turbine, feed water system, condensate system and cooling tower. INDE should
submit to the Bank a detailed report on the rehabilitation requirements of
the two units based on the findings of the manufacturers or experts
acceptable to the Bank not later than July 31, 1986. The estimated cost of
the repairs is US$8.0 million (mid 1986 prices) which results in an
attractive cost of US$93/kW.
Vehicles (INDE)
9.           INDE supplies many villages scattered around the country and
does not have a satisfactory number of operation and maintenance vehicles.
The proposed Project provides for the acquisition of about 90 vehicles to
complement INDE's current plan and enable it to reach the minimum requirement
of one vehicle per village (or villages within a distance of 50 km) with more
than 500 consumers.
Laboratory Equipment (INDE)
10.          The present INDE's need for a well equipped electronics
laboratory will progressively increase as Chixoy gets in operation, the
communications systems build up and the dispatch center is commissioned. It
is essential for the checking and repairs of the electronic components of the
generation and transmission protection, the communication system, the
supervision and control of the generating plants and substations.
Data Processing (INDE)
11.          The digital computer facilities of INDE are under dimensioned
and many of the components being out of date add to the inefficiency of the
services rendered to the technical, commercial and administrative areas. The
acquisition of a 4 megabyte computer with peripherals and about 20 remote
terminals, complemented by part of the existing equipment, would meet INDE's
needs for about 5 years after its installation. Software will be also
acquired as needed to strengthen the existing capability. In-house training
for mid-level staff and overseas training for leading professional staff
should also be carried out as part of INDE's training program (para. 12).

Training (INDE)
12.          The training unit of INDE was created last year and needs strong
support for the definition of a basic training policy, establishment of
training methodology, elaboration of procedures and manuals, acquisition of
teaching material, and training of its own instructors. A four-year plan
will be formulated as part of the proposed project, with assistance from
consultants to address those needs and establish the overseas training of
professional staff.

Background
1.      The public power market is served by EEG, INDE and 10 municipal
utilities. In 1985, about 81% of the retail market was served by EEG, 14% by
INDE, and 5% by the municipal utilities, as shown in the following table:

The distribution of electricity sales by sector for 1973, 1979 and
1985 is shown below:

The participation of the industrial sector has dropped drarmatically as a
result of a declining economic activity since 1980 (para. 3).
2.      In 1985, electricity consumption per capita was 15G kWh and the
electrification rate was 28%, both low by Central American standards.1/
Total number of residential consumers increased, however, at a rate oF about
7.4% p.a. from 1979 to 1985, well above the rate of growth of the population
(2.9%).
3.      In 1985, electricity sales were 1243 GWh (the same level as in
1979). The reduction of the electricity demand during the period 1980/1982
is related with a declining economic activity in the country due to a drop in
private investment, fall in sugar and coffee prices, and decline in the
Central American Common Market trade. Whereas the industrial demand has
dropped from 1979 to 1983 at an average rate of 9.8% p.a. (as compared to a
rate of growth of 11.8% p.a. from 1971 to 1979), the residential and
commercial sectors had an average rate of growth of about 3% in the same
period (as compared with 9.7% p.a. from 1971 to 1979). A slow recovery of
electricity consumption started in 1983, in which the increases in the
residential and commercial sectors offset the reduction in. the industrial
sector. In spite of the persisting economic difficulties, the lowering trend
in industrial consumption reversed in 1984 and in 1985 it increased 4.6%
(supported by an increase of 6.5% in the number of EEG industrial
consumers). The utilities have succeeded in connecting new
residential/commercial consumers at the satisfactory sustained rate of 7.1%
for the last 6 years (see also para. 2).
Sales Projections
4.      INDE revised the demand projections for the sector in August 1984
with assistance from independent consultants. The methodology used is
1/  Country        Consumption   Electrification
kWh/capita         rate %
El Salvador:      290              36%
Nicaragua:        299              45%
Costa Rica:       855              79%



_ 33 -                      ANNEX 3.5
Page 3 of 7
adequate and gives a separate treatment to each major category of electric
consumption (residential, commercial, industrial, public use), resorting to
the major variables that can explain the consumption 2/. By June 1985,
it was found that the short-term projections were somewhat optimistic.  INDE
adjusted the demand projections using the available demand for 1984 and early
1985. The revised demand projection (Attachment 1) represents a two year lag
by 1988 on the original INDE's projections, however, by the year 1993, the
consumption figures for both projections coincide. The average growth rate
for 1985-1993 period is 6.6%, below the historic trend from 1971 to 1979 (10%
p.a.). Based on present conditions, this seems reasonable. In spite of the
surpluses generated by Chixoy, there are no prospects of sales to neighboring
countries, even though mutual assistance during emergencies could occur
through the future interconnections with El Salvador and Honduras.
Losses and Generation Requirements
5.      Electricity losses in the interconnected system have been very high
during the last four years: an average of 16.9% (as a percentage of net
generation).  EEG's losses exceeded 15% in 1985, representing an upward trend
as compared to the average level of 8% in the 70's and the level of 9.5% in
1980. To some degree this is because investments in EEG's electric system
did not keep pace with the increase of demand in the late 70's and the
changing pattern of consumption in the 80's (para. 3) which has required more
intensive use of low voltage lines. The generation requirements for the
interconnected system were projected on the basis of the following loss and
station use assumptions.  Total system losses are expected to drop to 13% by
1990 reflecting a drop in EEG's losses to a level of 10%, as a result of the
proposed project; a better use of the 230/69 kV transmission system with
Chixoy coming on stream; and a better control by INDE on non technical
losses. Station use would drop from the 3.0% average in the last five years
(which is a reasonable value for a nearly 2/3 thermal-based generation
system), to 1% from 1986, when demand will be served nearly wholly by
hydroelectric plants.
Energy and Power Balances/Generation Expansion
Background
6.      According to the 1976 Master Plan for electricity supply, the
generation expansion for the 1980's relied on a few large and complex
hydroelectric projects (Chulac - 440 MW and Xalala - 360 MW) complemented by
medium-size hydros (El Carmen and Serchil) and geothermal alternatives.
Prefeasibility and feasibility studies for these projects showed, however,
that the medium size projects were not economically attractive, that the two
large projects had complex technical problems and that the geothermal
potential of Zunil had to be further explored to warrant installation in
excess of the planned 15 MW station.
2/ The methodology used represented an improvement with respect to previous
demand projection. The latter were mainly based on a correlation between
electricity consumption and GDP (gross domestic product): this method fails to
adequately reflect Government policies to promote oil substitution by
electricity or accelerated rates of electrification, which may take place
without any correlation with GDP increases.



ANNEX 3.5
- 34                       F TPage 4 of 7
7.      In 1980, a generation expansion program prepared by INDE recommended
commissioning 2 hydroelectric projects, Santa Maria II (68 IMW) and Chulac
(440 MW), in 1984 and 1988 respectively, complemented by the Zunil Geothermal
Project (15 MW) in 1986. In late 1981, the two hydroelectric stations were
under construction, and major contracts for civil works and electromechanical
equipment were ready for award. At that time, however, some new developments
affected the timing of both projects: first, it was apparent that
electricity demand was stagnant and that the demand projection used to
justify project timing was too optimistic; second, the Chulac project was
facing complex technical problems related to a poor rock condition at the dam
foundation and to the unprecedented use of an asphaltic blanket in a dam of
its characteristics that made it advisable to continue fieldi investigations
to demonstrate the project's technical and economic justification; and third,
the cost estimates for both projects, based on tender prices, were too high
and their economic justification was questionable.
8.      Following the advice of the Bank, in 1982 the Government took several
actions: (i) stopped the execution of the Chulac and Santa Maria II
hydroelectric projects; (ii) appointed a board of consultants to examine the
technical problems of Chulac; (iii) transferred the responsibility of
implementing Chulac hydropower project from HIDROCHULAC to INDE; and (iv)
revised the generation expansion program in the light of new demand
projections.
9.      Natural gas was studied in 1983 and abandoned as an uneconomically
competitive alternative to hydro, however present conditions of natural gas
development and hydro costs which may develop from the planned feasibility
studies may not lead to the same conclusion and thus warrant further
exploration of natural gas as a viable generation alternative.
10.     Chixoy first operated in June 1983.  As a result of the new demand
projections prepared in May 1983, it was apparent that it would not be
necessary to commence construction of a new major generation station before
1987 and that a decision about the development of a new generating station
would not have to be taken before mid-1985. In June 1985, the reappraisal
mission revised the demand projections (para. 4) and found that no other
project, besides Chixoy (tunnel which collapsed in December 1983 was under
final repairs) and Zunil I (15 MW, already committed with IDB financing),
should be commissioned before 1993.
Current Situation
11.     As of December 31, 1985 total installed capacity in the country was
587 MW (details in Attachment 2), of which 33% is hydro ancL 67% is thermal,
distributed as follows:

Fuel consumption for electricity generation in 1985 was about 1.8 million
barrels, representing nearly one fourth of total oil consumption in
Guatemala.
12.        In 1985, supply conditions have been unsatisfactory due to
repeated problems with the thermal plants (Annex 33, para. 7) and to a loss
of hydro capacity in the dry season, when the yearly maximum demand occurs
(Attachments 4 and 5 for energy and power balances). With the commissioning
of Chixoy in 1986, sizeable electrical energy surpluses are available. On
the basis of average streamflow conditions, no fossil-fueled generation
would be required until 1990. This period 1986-1990 is suitable for a
thorough maintenance of the Laguna thermal plant and the rehabilitation of
the Escuintla steam units scheduled for 1987/19884/. Once reliable thermal
power is again available it is advisable to inspect the Chixoy tunnel
(1989). During the outage of the Chixoy power plant (estimated to last some
six weeks to allow for minor repairs), thermal generation will be mandatory.
This underlines the importance of having existing thermal capacity5/ in good
operating conditions as a back-up for a major outage of Chixoy, whTch is a
high risk event for the reliable supply of the Guatemalan system, since
Chixoy will represent for many years after its commissioning a considerable
proportion of the generation sources. The thermal rehabilitation (Annex 3.3,
para. 8), because of its cost (US$8.0 million, US$93/kW) and the short term
required to have the 86 MW steam capacity at Escuintla available to the
system, is a much better solution than the acquisition of any other
generation means. On the other hand, such a cost is equivalent to a
curtailment of only 9.3 GWh6/. The rehabilitation is highly justified since
this curtailed energy corresponds in average to less than 5 days of Chixoy's
unavailability.
3/ Isolated plants located at the Exmibal nickel refinery, whose activities
were interrupted in 1980.
4/ Escuintla unit No. 1 boiler exploded in 1983 and Escuintla unit No. 2 needs
important repairs (Annex 3.3, para 8).
5/ Some 230 MW of thermal capacity should be given prioritary attention: 65 MW in
Laguna (operating in a combined-cycle mode) and 156 MW in Escuintla (86 MW steam
plus 80 MW gas turbines of reasonable performance). The remainder will be
progressively retired as maintenance and operating costs become too high.
6/ Curtailed energy valued at US$1.0/kWh.

The Expansion Program
13.      The current least-cost generation expansion program until 1995 is
defined on the basis of energy requirements and includes the Zunil I
geothermal plant (15 MW, a pilot project supported by IDB) in 1991, the Santa
Maria II hydroproject (68 MW) in 1993 and the Zunil II geothermal plant (55
MW) in 1995.
14.      Zunil I capital cost is expected to be about US$2,250/kW resulting
in an energy cost in the order of US cents 3.9/kWh7/. This compares
favorably with the fuel cost of the Escuintla steam units of US cents
4.7/kWh8/-
15.       Sta. Maria is the only non-committed project that has an acceptable
feasibility study. It would aggregate to the system capability 62 MW peak,
110 GWh firm energy per year and 222 GWh average energy per year. Its
current energy cost is around US cents 4.4/kWh average or US cents 8.8/kWh
firm9/. This is reasonable when compared with the present Chixoy costs of
US cents 5.6 and 8.0/kWh respectivelylO/.  Furthermore, the size of the
project is well suited to the market increases and would correspondingly be a
reasonably-scaled capital investment. The average energy cost also compares
favorably with the cost of running the most efficient existing thermal plants
(para. 14).
16.       Although the studies for the geothermal field of 2unil II have not
been started, it is believed that on the basis of the data collected for
Zunil I, there is a good prospect for the installation of a 55 MW unit at a
cost of US$2,250/kW. This would correspond, as for Zunil I, to an attractive
cost of US cents 3.9/kWh 7/, which is lower than other: projects at a
comparable degree of investigation or running the existing thermal plants
(para. 14), and for that it is considered as the next generation addition in
1995.
7/  At 10% discount rate, 70% capacity factor, May 1986 price levels, US$1 = Q 2.5,
interest during construction and 0 & M costs not included. At 12% discount rate
it would increase to US cents 4.6/kWh.
8/  At an average efficiency of 12.8 kWh net/gallon and a fuel cost (bunker) of
US$25/barrel at the plant.
9/  At 10% discount rate, May 1986 price levels, US$1 = Q 2.5, interest
during construction and 0 & M not included. At 12% discount rate, the
energy costs in US cents/kWh would be 5.2 (average energy) and 10.4 (firm
energy).
10/ At 10% discount rate, interest during construction and O & M costs not
included; all local costs have been valued at US$1 = Q 1. The remaining
local cost investment that would be affected by a new rate of exchange
US$1 = Q 2.5 is very small and would have a negligible effect on the
total cost in equivalent US dollars. At 12% discount rate, the energy
costs in US cents/kWh would be 6.8 (average energy) and 9.6 (firm
energy).

17.       As shown in Attachment 5, once energy requirements are met, there
will be a substantial power reserve. When the Chixoy plant is taken out for
tunnel inspection in 1989, a coordinated maintenance plan should ensure that
the remaining plant is fully available. The margin of 36% for power reserve
under those circumstances is more than adequate to meet forced outages.
18.       INDE is required to confirm that the current generation expansion
program is the least-cost solution (para 19). For instance, the timing of
Sta. Maria and Zunil II is very sensitive to the evolution of oil costs and
the ensuing operating costs of the Excuintla steam units. The proposed
Project includes further investigation in Chulac and Xalala to confer to the
existing studies an acceptable degree of confidence on the proposed solutions
and cost estimates or else to develop alternative solutions. IDB is
financing a program of feasibility studies of several sites in the rivers
Samala, Grande de Zacapa and middle Chixoy and at the geothermal field of
Zunil II or Amatitlan (whichever proves more attractive from the
prefeasibility studies financed by IDB and OPEC). INDE should update the
studies made in 1983 on the use of the natural gas being flared in the
Rubelsanto oil field for power generation and request from the MEM
Directorate of Hydrocarbons an evaluation of the mid-term prospects of other
natural gas developments and a gas pricing utilization study. The Bank
should closely supervise INDE's progress on this undertaking and provide
assistance, if necessary, in preparing terms of reference for the study.
INDE should also include in the formulation of alternatives the connection to
the system of the 58 MW steam-plant of the Exmibal nickel refinery.
Oil-fired plants, other than the existing ones, are bound to be uneconomical
and furthermore, the country is a heavy net importer of oil. Nevertheless,
the generation expansion study should evaluate the cost of energy produced by
new oil-fired plants to be used as a reference value for the assessment of
hydro and geothermal projects.
19.       No commitment needs to be made on generation expansion before
mid-1988. INDE has agreed to finish all required feasibility studies by
December 31, 1987 and present to the Bank a least-cost expansion program for
the nineties not later than March 31, 1988 (para. 2.09).

NOTES ON ORGANIZATIONAL AND INSTITUTIONAL ASPECTS
Organization
1.        Attachments I and 2 show the Organization Charts of INDE and EEG.
Training
2.        INDE's training activities need strengthening.  In 1984, a Training
Department was created under the Administrative Unit. The personnel involved
in this Department is insufficient in quantity and not well qualified.
Training programs have to be defined with emphasis on management and
professional staff, procedures to manage these programs have to be
established, and basic training equipment is required.
3.        EEG has a comprehensive training program for staff development at
all levels, but requires renewed equipment, technical assistance and
additional overseas training. EEG has built a training yard for linemen
which requires renewal and modern equipment to continue performing its role.
Technical assistance is also needed to update teaching materials and
methodology, to develop procedures and manuals, and to train instructors.
US$0.7 million is included in the proposed loan to finance EEG's training
component.
Accounting and Auditing
4,        INDE is in the process of improving its accounting system through
the engagement of a consultant funded by the last IDB loan; the monthly
financial statements are issued with two months delay compared with six
months of previous years. Due to the lack of computer capacity, several
accounting subsidiary systems (fixed assets, suppliers, income budget, budget
execution) have not yet been implemented. In 1978, INDE installed a HP/3000
computer - which is presently overloaded and must be replaced by a more
powerful machine. The proposed project includes provisions for the purchase
of computer facilities, and the corresponding software and training.
5.        INDE's internal auditing unit reports directly to the Board of
Directors. Its functions are limited to supervision of cash transactions,
contracts, and inventories because of lack of qualified personnel. Its scope
needs to be broadened to include, in a first stage, supervision of all
accounting systems and, in a second stage, internal control systems, and
operational systems. Consultants engaged in 1979 provided norms and
procedures that are partially being implemented. The internal control report
of the independent auditors calls for the attention of deficiencies in the
accounting and internal control systems. The Plan of Action proposed (Annex
3.1) addresses the needs of the internal auditing unit.

ANNEX 3.6
Page 2 of 2
6.        INDE's financial statements are audited by a local firm of
independent auditors (Arevalo Perez y Asociados - Arthur Anderson
correspondent), acceptable to the Bank, and present auditing aIrangements are
satisfactory. In 1982 and 1983, the former independent auditor (iizarralde,
Ayestas y Asociados) was not able to give an opinion because of substantig
differences found in many accounts. In 1984, the current independent audi-.r
gave a qualified opinion. INDE plans to engage a consultant, funded by the
last IDB loan, to improve its accounting procedures.  INDE should agree to
continue appointing independent auditors acceptable to the Bank and to send
to the Bank the audited financial statements together with the auditor's
reports within four months from the end of each fiscal year.
7.        EEG's accounting system is satisfactory and well suited to EEG's
needs. Internal control functions are vested in the Internal Auditing
Department, which reports to the General Manager. Internal audit carries an
adequate program of financial audits. EEG's financial statements are audited
by a local firm of independent auditors (Arevalo, Perez y Asociados),
acceptable to the Bank, and present auditing arrangements are satisfactory.
EEG should agree to continue appointing independent auditors acceptable to
the Bank and to send to the Bank the audited financial statements together
with the auditor's report within four months from the end of each fiscal
year.
Insurance
8.        INDE's insurance practices require to be improved.  For instance,
old thermal generating plants and electrical substations are! insured against
physical loss and direct damage covering 160X of historical book value, but
Aguacapa hydro plant is only covered for 60% of historical book value. Most
of the Chixoy hydroplant components need renewal of their insurance
policies. INDE has agreed with IDB to engage a consultant 1:0 address this
problem. Supervision missions should follow-up progress on this matter.
9.        EEG's insurance practices are acceptable but the amounts insured
are based on historical-valued assets instead of replacement: costs. EEG
carries insurance against all risk covering up to 70% of hisBtorical-valued
assets. EEG is already undertaking a study on insurance requirements which
is expected to be completed by May 31, 1986 and implemented thereafter.

GUATEMALA
POWER DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
Sector's Past Performance
1.        Between 1982 and 19841/, the Guatemalan power sector was in severe
financial difficulties, mainly as a result of the additional financial
requirements caused by the cost overrun and delays of Chixoy and ensuing
heavy fuel expenses. Furthermore, as a consequence of the recession, and of
problems in the operation of the thermal plants, electricity sales for this
period were 5% lower than between 1979 and 1981. The average tariff, which
is high in relation to the electricity tariffs of other central American
countries as measured at the official exchange rate2/, decreased slightly
from 13 US cents/kWh in 1982 to 12.7 US cents/kWh in 1984. The sector
achieved an average rate of return on historically-valued assets of 11.5%.
Because of the burden imposed by the construction of Chixoy, the average
contribution to investment program was only 13%, and the sector had to rely
on government contributions (36%) and borrowings (51%) to finance an
investment program of US$463.3 million.
INDE's Past Performance
2.        INDE's financial performance between 1982 and 1984 reflected the
evolution discussed above. In 1983, as a result of the temporary operation
of Chixoy hydro plant (Annex 3.4), INDE's bulk sales grew by 28% as compared
with 1982 and fuel expenses decreased by about 35% (Attachment 2.1) but this
improving trend was reversed in 1984 due to the Chixoy tunnel collapse.  In
1984, electricity sales decreased by 6.8% and fuel expenses increased by
about 23%. Since INDE was responsible for the construction of Chixoy between
1982 and 1984, it was only able to self finance about 5% of its investment
program, which was mainly funded by government contribution (36%) and
borrowings (53%). The remainder (6%) was provided by decreases in working
capital. The debt service coverage ratio was 1.0.
INDE's Finance Structure
3.        As of December 31, 1984, INDE's financial structure was the
following (Attachment 2.3):
US$ million            %
Equity                                          991.2              66
Long-term Debt                                  386.8              26
Current Liabilities                             122.3               8
Other Liabilities                                 1.9              -
TOTAL                              1,502.2             100
1/   Since only preliminary financial data were available for 1985 at the
time of the report, the historical financial analysis was made up to
1984.
2/   The average prices of electricity in some countries of the Region were
in UScents/kWh: Costa Rica 4.2 (in 1983); Panama 12.4 (in 1983);
Honduras 8.9 (in 1984); Guatemala 12.7 (in 1984).

4.        As of December 31, 1984, INDE's principal creditors were
international financing institutions (71% of the total long-term debt): the
debt balance to IDB under its first seven loans amounted to US$141 million
(34%); and the balance to the Bank amounted to US$109 million (26%). The
other international creditors were CABEI with US$31 million (7%) and AID with
US$13 million (3%). The Government is the only local creditor (29% of the
total long term debt).
EEG's Past Performance
5.        Between 1982 and 1984, EEG's financial performance was
satisfactory. In 1984, electricity sales, which represent about 80% of the
sector's retail sales, were 3.7% higher than in 1983 but sl:ill 2.7% below the
1979 level. In late 1984, INDE's tariff rate for bulk sales to EEG was
increased by 20% in order to transfer funds to INDE as agreed with the Bank
during the negotiations for the Chixoy's supplemental loan.
6.        Internal cash generation allowed EEG to fund its working capital
and investment requirements without borrowing.  However, i t should be noted
that investment was kept low due to the country's constraints in the access
to foreign exchange. A large component of the working capital is accounts
receivable which have been steadily growing from US$ 24.1 million in 1982 to
US$36.4 million in 1984, equivalent to 107 billing days.  Most of this amount
is owed by municipalities and Government agencies and it is mainly (US$21.6
million) owed by the capital city's water supply company (EMPAGUA). Loan
1605-GU provides that by December 31, 1986 power sector's accounts receivable
from public agencies shall not exceed US$15.5 million. This covenant was
modified during negotiations to further strengthen this commitment. (Chapter
4).
EEG' Financial Structure
7.        As of December 31, 1984, EEG financial structure was composed of:
other liabilities US$5.2 million (5%) (Attachment 3.3). EEG has only used
short-term loans in the past, which amounted to US$0.6 million as of December
31, 1984.
Investment Program and Financing Plan
8.        The investment program and financing plan are shown in detail in
Attachment 1.2 (Sector), 2.2 (INDE) and 3.2 (EEG) to this annex and are
summarized below:

9.        Based on the assumptions of an exchange rate of US$1 = Q2.5 for
debt since payments in 1988 and thereafter (para. 12), and provided that
tariff levels would be set so as to achieve the 5% rate of return agreed with
the Government (para. 14), it is expected that the sector would be able to
finance the investment program without difficulties. Future borrowings for
financing the foreign component of the program have been considered under
current international agency terms (FIV, CABEI, IDB), which are shown in
Attachment 2.4 to this annex.

ANNEX 3.9
Page 4 of 5
Assets and Revaluation
10.       Both INDE and EEG have yet to incorporate revaluation of assets
into their accounting systems. The study for the revaluation of sector
assets was completed with figures as of December 31, 1979. Since the study
includes the revaluation system, INDE and EEG should not encounter major
difficulties in updating the figures of the study. In addition, the book
value of INDE's assets requires a reassessment because: (i) some thermal
plants are to be scrapped; and (ii) a decision needs to be taken on the
accounting treatment of a significant amount of studies (US$63 million),
some of which are quite old. These amounts should either be debited to
ongoing projects or operating plant if appropriate, or written off. The plan
of action proposed (Annex) addresses the revaluation of INDE's and EEG's
assets and the valuation of INDE's fixed assets.
Sector's Financial Outlook
11.       The Guatemalan power sector (Attachments 1.1 to 1.4) is expected to
perform satisfactorily during the 1986-1993 period provided that the tariff
and rate of return targets are achieved (para. 13). This would enable INDE
and EEG to carry out the project in a timely fashion.
12.       The financial forecast has been based on the assumption that, in
December 1987, the Government will set the exchange rate at US$1 = Q2.5 for
all transactions. Additionally, the financial forecast assumes that during
the 1988-1993 period the exchange rate will be adjusted to reflect the
difference between domestic and international inflation. Sensitivity studies
show that in case of a higher devaluation, the 5% rate of' return would
suffice to ensure the soundness of the financing plan but: additional
financing would be temporarily required.
13.       During the projection period tariff levels should be adjusted to
achieve a consolidated rate of return on fully revalued assets not lower than
5%.  This will require a higher increase in the early years of the program,
to be tapered over the period to reflect the projected decline in operating
costs (para. 18) and in the direction of the system's long run marginal costs
(Annex 3.11). Nominal increases of 22% in 1987, 48% in 1988 and 39% in 1989
would be required to meet the 5% rate of return. To avoiLd a sharp punctual
increase in January 1988, during negotiations INDE and EEG agreed to increase
their average tariff to final consumers by 4% monthly during 1987. The
4% monthly increase during 1987 imply that an average increase of 13 % is
required in 1988 (for instance 13% in January or about 2% monthly during the
year), tapering towards 1993. These tariff adjustments would be adequate to
meet the financial requirements of the sector including a contribution of
about US$93 million during 1989-1993 from INDE to the Government (para. 18).
14.     To ensure the soundness of the financial plan until the project is
completed, during negotiations, INDE and EEG agreed to set tariffs to enable
each utility to earn a rate of return not lower than 5%, on a rate base
annually revalued using a methodology satisfactory to the Bank. The rate of
return covenant of Loan 1605-GU 4/ was superseded by this agreement. For
4/   5% in 1986-1987; 6% in 1988; 7% in 1989; and 8% in 1990 and thereafter.

ANNEX 3.9
Page 5 of 5
1988, the calculation of rate of return will take into account the net income
in excess of what could have been required to reach a 5% rate of return in
1987.
15.       In addition, at negotiations, the Government agreed to maintain the
concurrence of the Bank as stated in clause 5.07 of the loan agreement for
the Chixoy Hydro Project (Loan 1605-GU), before authorizing any capital
expenditures in new projects which are not included in an updated investment
program as reviewed by the Bank.
16.       Following the commissioning of Chixoy in early 1986, the Guatemalan
power sector becomes a hydro based system; fuel costs are reduced
significantly and the cost structure shifts from one of heavy share of fuel
expense into one of an increasing share of depreciation (Attachment 1.1).
Fuel expenses would become 3% of operating expenses in the 1985-1993 period,
as compared with 53% in the 1982-1984 period. For the same period,
depreciation, which was 14% of operating expenses, would become 56%.
Operating costs per kWh sold are projected to decline in real terms over the
1986-1993 period.
Performance and Financial Indicators
17e       Attachment 1.4 defines targets for improving the operating
efficiency of EEG and INDE.
INDE's Financial Outlook
18.       In general, INDE's finances (Attachments 2.1 to 2.7) reflect the
sector finances. The rate of return based on revalued assets would be
practically the same as the sector's rate of return, as INDE's rate base
represents 96% of the sector's rate base. Internal cash generation after
transferring funds to Government and receiving EEG's dividends (para. 19)
should allow INDE to finance 66% of its investment program as average during
1986-1993 period. This implies a significant improvement in INDE's
performance, and indicates that not only will it not require financial
assistance from the Government, but may actually be in condition to repay
some of the funds it received in recent years. However, to ensure that such
transfers to the Government do not negatively impact INDE's financial
soundness and the pace of project execution, limitations to this transfer
were included during negotiations (Chapter 4). The existing covenant under
Loan 1605-GU on the debt service coverage ratio (1.5) was extended to EEG.
EEG's Financial Outlook
19.       Assuming that tariff levels would be set to allow EEG to achieve
the proposed 5% rate of return EEG's finances (Attachmens 3.1 to 3.3) are
expected to be satisfactory. Internal cash generation would allow EEG to
finance 39% of the investment program, after income taxes and dividends.
EEG would still have temporary surplus funds assuming EMPAGUA payments of its
arrears in 1986. During negotiations, agreements were reached in payments of
dividends and electricity bills (Chapter 4).

ANNEX 3.10
GUATEMALA
POWER DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
POWER SECTOR TARIFFS
1.        The tariff structures and levels of INDE and EEG are not uniform
(Attachments 1 and 2). INDE's rate for bulk sales to EEG is established
under a private agreement, not subject to Governmental approval. In
compliance with conditions established in Bank Loans 1605-GU and 1406-GUl/
in February 1985, INDE's bulk sale rates were increased by 20%.
2.        A Bank financed tariff study carried out by int:ernational
consultants in 1983 found that INDE's and EEG's tariff sl:ructures were out of
line with the structures calculated on the basis of long-term marginal
costs. A subsequent review of the study by the staff of INDE's Planning
Department, concluded that its assumptions were outdated. Until the
expansion program for the sector has been defined, however, it would not make
sense to carry out an update. However, some actions cou:Ld still be
undertaken to simplify the existing tariff schedules and promote their
uniformity. In this regard, the plan of action for instLtutional improvement
(Annex 3.1) agreed during negotiations with INDE and EEG included a review of
the electricity tariff schedules based on criteria satisfactory to the Bank,
to be made by INDE's staff and completed by December 31, 1986, and its
recommendations subsequently implemented according to a timetable
satisfactory to the Bank.
1/   The loan covenants provided that INDE's rates for bulk sales to EEG
would be set at a level required to transfer to INDE all funds available
to EEG in excess of EEG's requirements for operations, repayment of
debt, net working capital and capital expenditures.

POWER DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
1.        The Project consists of two distinct components: (i) capital
expenditures, comprising EEG's distribution expansion program for the period
1987-1992 and selected items of INDE's investment program for the same period
(thermal plant rehabilitation, dispatch center and assocLated communications
facilities, computer center, vehicles, laboratory equipment); and (ii)
preinvestment studies for INDE (para. 4.04c). The two components, however,
are part of the Power Sector investment program and cannot be evaluated in
isolation. Consequently, the economic analysis of the project was carried
out for the entire investment program.
The Least-Cost Solution
2.        EEG's distribution expansion program includes normal expansion of
primary and secondary feeders and extension of the 69 kV subtransmission
system. The expansion requirements were determined based on expected load
growths and normal standards of quality of supply. In general, there were
few alternatives for the distribution system expansion, other than to
consider conductor and transformer sizing, and substation expansion, as
explained below. Sizing of primary and secondary circuilts and of
distribution transformers was optimized to minimize totaL investment and
operating cost. The design of 69 kV substations was revLsed andthe expansion
of existing substation was analyzed as an alternative to the construction of
new substations. The Program includes changing power transformers to
increase their capacity in substations where this alternative was considered
appropriate. Extension of the 69 kV subtransmission system in Guatemala City
was limited to improvement in the reliability and flexibility of operation of
the subtransmission network, necessary. to adapt the distribution system to
the latest 230 kV supply point (Guatemala Norte Substation) linked to the
Chixoy Hydroelectric Plant. BEG existing subtransmissiom and distribution
voltages (69 kV and 13.2 kV) are considered adequate for the planning horizon
studied.
3.        INDE's investment expansion program has been reviewed to ascertain
that only essential investments in generation, transmissLon and distribution
are planned. Least-cost generation expansion is discussed in para. 3.08 and
Annex 3.6. Transmission, including the 69 kV subtransmission, is based on a
previous study made by consultants which defined the maxLmum level of 230 kV
as being adequate for system development beyond the period under
consideration. The same study defined 69 kV as the adequate level for
subtransmission. The present 230/69 kV program expansioni was scheduled on

ANNEX 3.11

the basis of expected load growths and normal standards of quality supply.
Distribution expansion has been designed as a normal expansion of the
existing networks in the small and middle size cities covered by INDE,
according to INDE's standards, to meet the expected load growth. Other
capital investment items included in the program such as the dispatch center
and associated communications, have been designed as to include the essential
features required to help provide an acceptable level of reliability to the
system operations, with minimum capital expenditures (Annex 4.4).
Economic Costs and Benefits
4.        The program costs include capital investments, and incremental
operation and maintenance costs associated to the expansion of capacity, and
the costs of preinvestment studies mentioned above. Fuel expenses (derived
from simulating the system's operation) were found to be incurred during the
temporary shut-down of Chixoy and in the two years preceding the
commissioning of new generation facilities, and valued at CIF prices of
imported heavy fuel-oil. Capital investments consist of expenditures on
generation, transmission, distribution, and other additions to fixed assets
(communications, dispatch center, property, vehicles). All cost streams were
expressed at border prices in May 1986 dollars; an exchange rate of Q 2.5 =
US$1 was used for the conversion of local costs. Local costs, largely
consisting of labor costs, were shadow priced by a factor of 0.85, to account
for unemployment conditions in Guatemala.
5.        The benefits derived from the program are associated to the
increase in sales resulting from the new investments, with a one year lag,
and expressed in border prices. Incremental sales were valued at the average
electricity rate levels resulting from the covenanted financial rate of
return.
Rate of Return
6.        The resulting rate of return is about 12%, which is at the upper
end of the range assumed for the opportunity cost of capital in Guatemala (10
- 12%). The foregoing revenue-based rate of return, which is more a measure
of the adequacy of tariffs to the incremental costs of the investment program
than a measure of the project's economic merits, thus indicates that the
covenanted tariff adjustments would be sufficient to meet the long-term
marginal costs of power supply in Guatemala.
7.        The 12% estimated rate of return does not fully measure the
benefits to society, resulting from the implementation of the project. These
include the social benefits of residential and public uses, and the economic
benefits to production of reliable electricity supply. In this sense, the
base value of 12% is deemed to be a minimum measure of the benefits conferred
by the project.

changes in key parameters on the rate of return. The results are shown
