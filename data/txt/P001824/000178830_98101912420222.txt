I. PROJECT GENESIS, COMPONENTS AND INSTITUTIONS
A. General
1.01      Mauritania's 1.5 million people occupy 1.2 million km , about
three-quarters of which is in the Sahara desert with the remainder in the
Sahel. GDP at factor cost was about UM 17.4 billion (US$384 million) in 1977,
but the GDP per capita of about US$270 hides the extreme poverty of the vast
majority of the population who do not participate directly in the dominant
enclave mining sector.
1.02      At independence in 1960, some 80% of Mauritanians were poor nomadic
herdsmen, while a small French enclave controlled the iron ore production
around Nouhadibou. The mining and large-scale modern sectors grew rapidly
thereafter, encouraged by Government incentives, and this growth, coupled with
the Sahelian droughts of the early 1970s and their devastating effects on
cattle herds, culminated in a 1977 situation in which the modern sector
(especially mining of iron ore and copper) contributed some 66% of GDP, while
agriculture (including livestock production) contributed less than 30%.
1.03      Following independence, the Government took over MIFERMA (the French
mining company), converted it into the Societe Nationale Industrielle et
Miniere (SNIM), and also undertook to pay substantial compensation (US$90
million) 1/ to MIFERMA's previous shareholders. These payments have placed a
considerable strain on the budget and balance of payments. Since then, income
from iron ore, which accounts for 80% of export earnings, has been drastically
reduced by the fall in world prices, as well as disruption of production and
shipments by guerrila activity. The war in the former Spanish Sahara has also
proved extremely costly, inflating the need for foreign payments precisely
when foreign exchange receipts are shrinking.
1.04      The series of droughts (para 1.02 above) killed off a great deal of
livestock, forcing thousands of nomadic herdsmen to migrate to urban areas.
SNIM although primarily concerned with the mining sector, nevertheless also
created some industrial enterprises as the Government's intermediary. Govern-
ment itself also tried to provide employment (and some import substitution)
through some large public sector industries, e.g., oil and sugar refineries.
Thus, between 1973 and 1978, Government borrowed an average of US$115 million
a year to finance large-scale public enterprises which, for the most part,
will make little or no impact on GDP in the short- or medium-term. Also,
because of their very high cost per job, the large industries have not made
the hoped-for impact on the unemployment problem. Nevertheless, following
its "Plan de Redressement Economique et Financier", the new military Govern-
ment seems to have arranged for financial assistance totalling about US$151
million, of which US$45 million has been disbursed. This assistance is
expected to relieve the situation somewhat during 1978 and 1979.
1/   US$40 million immediately and the rest in equal annual installments.

1.05      Faced with this catalogue of financial and economic woes - an
extremely costly war, a projected US$50 million annual balance of payments
deficit, a projected food deficit of 70,000 tons of grain a year, an unusually
rapid rate of forced urbanization, a rapidly shrinking rural sector Jith a
modern sector that, if not shrinking, is not developing rapidly - Government
is rethinking its development philosophy. It now wishes to implement a new
strategy, shifting the emphasis from large industries with doubtful return to
quick-yielding, cost-efficient, employment-creating, and food-producing
investments.
B. Project Concept and Institutions
1.06      As one of the first expressions of this new strategy, Government has
requested IDA financing for a package of three small projects plus studies and
technical assistance, the short-term impact of which would be the simultaneous
relief of rural and urban poverty through the immediate creation of additional
employment and income opportunities in the industrial, artisan and smallholder
agriculture sectors, as well as immediate increase in food production. The
long-term result of this package would be easier and more sustained growth in
all three sectors as a result of fundamental sectoral and institutional
reforms to be introduced through this project.
1.07      More specifically, the project would include the following:
(a)  technical and financial assistance to small- and medium-scale
industrial enterprises promising substantially lower costs
per job than are now current (estimated total cost about
US$2.9 million, including US$0.8 million entrepreneurs'
contribution);
(b)  technical and financial assistance for artisans engaged in
the weaving of knotted carpets (about US$2.3 million);
(c)  technical and financial assistance for the development of
30-village irrigation schemes (VIS) along the Senegal river
betwTeen Kaedi and Selibaby (about US$3.4 million);
(d)  3-man-years of technical assistance for BMDC which would
act as financial intermediary for (a) above;
(e)  two studies designed to promote future development by (i)
finding a viable local construction material which can
replace imported cement in the construction of low-cost
housing; and (ii) creating a real industrial zone
in Nouakchott.

Studies
1.09      The financial sector, and BMDC, the financial intermediary for the
industrial line of credit, are discussed in detail in Chapter II. Chapters
III, IV and V discuss respectively the sectoral and institutional aspects of
the industrial, artisanal, and agricultural components of the project.
Chapter VI discusses detailed project proposals, project costs, financing,
risks and justification, as well as those aspects (e.g., procurement, dis-
bursement, etc.) which are common to all project components.

II. THE FINANCIAL SECTOR AND BMDC
A. The Sector
Background
2.01      Mauritania, which was a member of the West Africa Monetary Union
(UMOA) 1/ since the latter's establishment in 1962, withdrew from the Union
and the Franc Zone in mid-1973. A central bank, La Banque Centrale de la
Mauritanie (BCM), was established and was followed by the introduction of a
new currency, the Ouguiya, whose value is reviewed daily by BCM and is linked
to five currencies 2/.
The Banking System
2.02      The development bank, Banque Mauritanienne pour le Developpement
et le Commerce (BMDC), carries on substantial commercial banking operations
as well as financing of housing. It also extends development credits to the
local industry. These operations and BMDC's structure and current situation
are discussed in more detail below. In addition to BMDC, there are four com-
mercial banks. Two of these were established fairly recently: Banque Arabe
Libyenne Mauritanienne (BALM) in 1972, and Banque Arabe Africaine en Mauritanie
(BAAM) in 1974. The other two are ex-subsidiaries of French banks now with
Mauritanian majority control: Banque Internationale pour la Mauritanie (BIMA)
which belonged to the group BIAO, and Societe Mauritanienne de Banques (SMB)
which belonged to the group of Societe Generale. The oldest bank (BIMA) now
has total assets of UM 1.8 billion and 35.6% of total bank deposits; SMB has
assets of UM 1.5 billion with 16.5% of deposits; BALM assets of UM 2.1 billion
with 26.9% of deposits, and BAAM assets of UM 2.1 billion with UM 354 million,
or 11% of all bank deposits. The Government has a majority controlling
interest in all these banks, except for BALM, where it owns 49% of the share
capital.
Government Financial Sector Policies
a.   Monetary and Liquidity Policies
2.03      In addition to serving as the banker for the Government and a
source of short- and medium-term refinancing for the banks (BCM does not
rediscount for terms exceeding 8 years), BCM also acts as a regulatory
1/   Union Monetaire Ouest Africaine now includes as members Benin, Ivory
Coast, Niger, Senegal, Togo and Upper Volta.
2/   US dollar, French franc, Belgian franc, Deutsch Mark and Dutch guilder.

agency for the banking activities in Mauritania and, through the rediscount
system, exercises a close supervision over the lending activities of all
the banks. Control of non-rediscountable credits is exercised through the
system of prior-approvals, whereby each individual credit has to be submitted
for prior approval to BCM (except for short-term credits below UM 2 million).
2.04      Individual bank ceilings for rediscountable short-term credit (less
than two years) and medium-term credit are determined separately by BCM every
six months. The short-term rediscounting for an individual bank does not
normally exceed 50% of its foreseen short-term financing operations. Under
exceptional circumstances, BCM does however provide further support through
temporary advances (pension) above the approved rediscount ceiling. These
temporary advances are given for a term not exceeding 30 days, and at an
interest rate which is 2 to 4% higher than the rediscount rate, depending on
the amount.
2.05      Medium-term rediscountable loans generally finance housing construc-
tion costs and local currency costs of an investment project. They also cover
the import component for such projects, when external term loans or suppliers'
credits are not available. Rediscountable medium-term credit could be up to
65% for all industrial and agricultural development projects and up to 80% for
projects submitted by small- and medium-scale enterprises which benefit from a
guarantee from the state or from a public guarantee institution but this
special facility has, so far, not been used. Credits for construction of
housing are rediscounted to the extent of 30% of the cost, except for low-cost
housing where the proportion is increased to 80%.
2.06      The medium-term rediscount ceiling for a development bank is defined
by BCM as 150% of the sum of the banks' equity (minus fixed assets, equity
investments and losses, if any) and its long- and medium-term resources (minus
term loans not rediscountable). For commercial banks the rediscount ceiling
is defined as the sum of the bank's net equity (as defined above), its term
resources (minus term loans not rediscountable) and 25% of its demand and
short-term deposits. Medium-term credits guaranteed by the Government for
financing of productive industrial and agricultural projects as well as for
low-cost housing are not included in the ceilings, although they nevertheless
are eligible for rediscounting at BCM.
b.   Term Financing
2.07      Given the 8-year limit on BCM rediscounting (para 2.03), there
is no internal source of long-term financing. BMDC, which was the only bank
in a position to provide such financing in the past on a case-by-case basis
through refinancing from the Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique
stopped doing so since 1973, when Mauritania withdrew from the Franc zone.
The bulk of term financing in the country has thus been provided by medium-
term rediscounting, accounting for 87% of total medium-term credit outstanding



- 6 -
in Mauritania as at December 31, 1976.  Rediscounting of short-term credit at
BCM? has also been used regularly by the banks and accounted for 23.1% of total
short-term credit outstanding in the country as at December 31, 1976.
c.   Interest Rates
2.08      BCM regulates interest rates charged by banks on short- and medium-
term credits. While a straight rate of 11% is applicable to all medium-term
credits not rediscountable at BCM, the rates applicable to rediscountable
credits vary from a minimum of 5.75% to a maximum of 6.5% for credits to
low-cost housing and productive sectors (agriculture, industry and commerce)
and from 9.0% - 10.5% for all other sectors. The rediscounting rate at BCM
is 4.5% for credits to productive sectors and 5.5% for the others. The spread
allowed to the banks thus ranges from 1.25% to 2% on credits to productive
sectors and from 3.5% to 5% on the others. The rates of interest charged on
short-term credits follow a similar pattern and range from 5.5% to 7.5% on
rediscountable credits and from 8% to 11% on non-rediscountable ones.
2.09      BCM also regulates interest paid on small private deposits (UM I
million or less). Sight deposits earn up to 3.25% and term deposits between
2% and 6%, depending on term and amount of deposits. For term deposits in
excess of UM 1 million and those from state and parastatal companies, the
interest rate is left free to be negotiated between the parties.
Financial Sector Issues
2.10      The main issues of the financial sector are:
-    how, in the short to medium term, to ensure sufficient
term-financing on suitable terms, especially for agricultural,
industrial and artisanal sectors; and
-    how, in the long term, to ensure that the interest rate
structure properly reflects the demand and supply for loanable
funds.
2.11      Given the complete lack of domestic long-term funds (para 2.07)
there is clearly a need to attract resources, both from domestic depositors
and from external lenders, to finance development. Higher interest rates
might attract more domestic deposits, but the problem is more serious with
regard to foreign borrowing.  With the current inflation rate running at about
10% and expected to average 9% over the next three years, as against final
borrowers currently paying only an average interest of 6% to 6.5% on indus-
trial and housing loans, it is difficult to see how money raised in world
financial markets at about 8% can be used to finance activities in these key
sectors without substantial subsidies from an already hard-pressed Government
treasury. For this project, interest rates would be 11% on loans to small-
and medium-scale industries and 8.5% to farmers and artisans.



B. Banque Mauritanienne pour le Developpement et le Commerce
Background and Objectives
2.12      BMDC was established in 1961 as a purely development bank (Banque
Mauritanienne pour le Developpement (BMD) by the Government of Mauritania
and the Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique (CCCE). The main objective
of the bank was to promote economic and social development of the country.
However, over the years BMDC developed mostly as a housing and consumer-credit
financing institution and got more and more actively involved in short-term
borrowing and lending operations. This situation was formalized in June 1974
when its name was changed from BMD to BMDC (Banque Mauritanienne pour le
Developpement et le Commerce). Under its revised statutes, BMDC has a broad
mandate authorizing it to carry out the full range of commercial banking
activities. It is also authorized to act as an agent for the government.
Since its inception, BMDC has worked mainly with locally available funds
including rediscounting from the Central Bank (BCM), except for four loans
totalling CFAF 384 million (UM 79 million) provided by CCCE to finance
building constructions for the airport at Nouakchott and housing development
for the old mining company, MIFERMA.
Ownership
2.13      BMDC's initial share capital was CFAF 200 million (UM 40 million)
owned by the Government (58%), CCCE (34%) and BCEAO (8%).  In 1973, when
Mauritania withdrew from the Franc Zone and established its own central bank,
the shares of BCEAO were transferred to BCM. In 1974, BMDC's capital was
increased. CCCE's shares were bought over by the Government, and Societe
Tunisienne de Banque (STB) was introduced as a new shareholder. The fully
paid-up capital of BMDC as at March 31, 1978 was UM 80 million owned by the
Government (76%), STB (20%) and BCM (4%). As of February 1979, BMDC and IFC
were discussing the possibilities of the latter's equity participation in
BMDC.
Board of Directors
2.14      BMDC's Board consists of twelve members appointed by the Government
(10), BCM (1) and STB (1). Directors representing the Government, including
the chairman of the Board, are all senior civil servants holding responsible
positions in various ministries. Although the statutes require the Board to
meet at least four times a year, this rule has not been observed lately.
Moreover, although limits on the Credit Committee's and General Manager's
powers for granting short-, medium- and long-term credits have been defined by
the Board, the credit committee as such does not exist, and in several cases
credits exceeding the limits set down have in fact been approved by the
General Manager prior to obtaining the approval from the Board. Assurances
were, therefore, obtained at negotiations that, in the future, BMDC's
Management would adhere strictly to the procedures and loan approval limits
established by its Board.



Management
2.15      For close to 12 years, technical assistance to BMDC management was
provided by CCCE. In 1974, when the mandate of BMDC was broadened and CCCE
was replaced by STB, a team of five experts was sent by STB to provide manage-
ment and expertise required to launch BMDC as a fully-fledged commercial bank.
Tunisian technical assistance was reduced in July 1977 when the Tunisian
general manager was replaced by Mr. Kane, the present Mauritanian general
manager. At present, Tunisian assistance consists of two persons, the chief
of Documentary Credits Section, and a banker who joined BYDC in February 1978
as advisor to the general manager. However, all the institution building in
the last 4 years at least, has been geared to commercial, rather than develop-
ment, banking. Technical assistance in the field of development banking
should, therefore, be one of the priorities of any Bank Group intervention at
BMDC (para 2.23).
2.16      Mr. Amadou Kane, who was the chief accountant of 3CM prior to
assuming the position of general manager at BMDC, had no experience of develop-
ment banking and only limited operational experience of commercial banking.
The departure of the Tunisian general manager, who, moreover, did not have a
Mauritanian counterpart under training, thus left a serious vacuum at the top
management. This deficiency has, to a certain extent, been overcome by now,
partly due to Mr. Kane's efforts and partly due to the arrival of the Tunisian
advisor (para 2.15), who is providing technical assistance mainly in commer-
cial banking.
Organization (Chart II)
2.17      BMDC is functionally organized into four departments:  operations,
credit, accounting, and administration. All these departments are headed by
experienced and able Mauritanians who have been in BMDC for several years.
While the accounts are generally well kept, document handling and filing could
be improved.
2.18      The present organizational structure of BMDC, essentially tailored
to suit the needs of a purely commercial banking institution, has on the
whole, served BMDC's requirements satisfactorily. However, there are important
weaknesses. For example, BMDC does not carry out a systematic review of the
arrears, neither does it follow any established program for their recovery.
It also lacks an adequate internal control system, with the result that
certain statutory infringements are carried forward from one year to the other
as a matter of routine and never brought to the attention of the management in
order to be corrected. Furthermore, distribution of responsibilities between
departmental heads could probably be spelled out more precisely and put in
writing.
2.19      All these problems have been discussed with the management, which
has set up a separate unit responsible for a systematic review of the arrears
and follow-up of recoveries. Similarly, procedures for regular internal
aNid,tts vexe intr oduced recently.



-9-
Staff
2.20      BMDC's employees number 77, of whom only 19 are professionals
(including the two expatriate advisors), four with university or equivalent
qualifications. The professional staff is on the whole of good caliber,
highly motivated and eager to learn new techniques but thinly spread, rela-
tively young and inexperienced. Training has been mainly on the job, but
there are plans to send three staff members to BNDA and CCI in the Ivory Coast
and STB in Tunisia. Locally available training facilities at the central bank
are also being explored and staff members are being encouraged to take appro-
priate correspondence courses partly financed by BMDC. Possibilities for
sending staff to EDI and some other DFCs working with the World Bank Group
were also explored, and Mr. Kane has agreed to pursue an active training
program for professional development of BMDC staff. The development of such a
program will go a long way towards increasing the effectiveness and motivation
of the staff.
Policies and Operating Guidelines
2.21      BMDC's Policy Statement (Reglement interieur) defines BMDC's opera-
tional and financial policies. BMDC limits its equity investments in a firm
to 25% of the firm's share capital with the aggregate amount of investments
and fixed assets limited to 25% of its own equity. However, BMDC does not
have any limit on its total exposure (loans and equity), neither in terms of
its own resources nor in relation to the project's total cost. In fact,
financing in some cases has been close to 100% of the project cost, with term
commitments to private projects ranging up to 60% of BMDC's own equity and
those to public projects to over 100% of its own equity. For example, BMDC's
lending, approved by the previous management, to Societe Mauritanienne des
Industries et de L'Equipement (MIE) has gone up to about UM 118 million,
approximately equivalent to BMDC's equity. Total recovery of this loan appears
doubtful due to MIE's weak financial position caused by serious start up delays.
The government has decided to take steps to strengthen its management and to
render the project profitable. In the meantime, the government has agreed to
cover any reduction of BMDC's capital, provisions or reserves as of December 31,
1977 if such reduction is caused by a loss on any BMDC loan whose original
amount, exceeded UM 30 million. (The MIE loan was originally UM 33 million).
This government commitment will be included in the subsidiary loan agreement
between the government and BMDC.
2.22      To prevent future over-exposure, BMDC has amended its regulations to
ensure that its total exposure in term loans and equity participation in a
single project will be limited to 30% of its share capital and free reserves,
or to 90% of the project cost, whichever is lower. Exceptions could be made
for projects from public companies, provided a state guarantee is obtained
and only subject to the approval of the Board on a case-by-case basis. These
lending limits have recently been written into BMDC's policy statement.

.ADprai _als
2.23      Appraisals for term-credits and equity investments are carried out by
the cre6ii- department.  There are no formal guidelines for the appraisal  rf
industrial projects. Fairly simple guidelines have been drawn up for consumer
and housing credits.  Appraisal reports on industrial projects prepared
by B`DC showed that the appraisal capability of BMDC is extremely poor and
needs to be substantially strengthened. Appraisal work mainly focuses on
financial aspects,while only lip service is paid to technical, marketing,
management and economic matters.
Technical Assistance for BMDC
2.24      To strengthen BMDC's appraisal capability, the project would provide
US$376,000 for a total of three man-years of technical assistance to BMDC to
enable it to establish a Development Department to be devoted primarily to
industrial project identification, appraisal and supervision. US$37,000 would
also be provided for extra costs of foreign training for BMDC senior staff,
including the Mauritanian counterpart for the proposed technical assistant.
Disbursements and Procurement
2.25      All borrowers are asked to open an account with BMDC.  For consumer
credits, clients are not asked to finance any part of cost, nor are they
required to produce any proforma invoices and, since the proceeds of the loan
are directly credited to clients' accounts, BMDC is totally unaware of the
final utilization of the loans. In the way they are managed, BMDC's consumer
credits are in fact personal loans. Disbursements for housing credits are
better controlled as no funds are disbursed before the borrower has paid his
share of the investment. The payments are then made progressively in accord-
ance with the work performed. Progress under construction is verified by
on-site checks. Procurement is checked at time of the application when BMDC
refers all applications to the Societe de Construction et de Gestion Immobiliere
(SOCOGIM). For industrial projects BMDC does not ask for competitive bidding,
nor does it try to satisfy itself of the adequacy of the suppliers' offer.
Disbursements are made at borrowers' request without much control over the
progress of the project and even when the borrower's share of the investment
has not been paid in. BMDC's amended policy statement requires all project
beneficiaries to deposit their contribution, or satisfactory evidence of its
expenditure on the approved subproject, with BMDC before the latter would
disburse its contribution to subproject financing.
Follow-up
2.26      There is a total lack of procedures for the follow-up of both the
projects under construction and those in operation. The only instances of
visits to the projects are those for housing credits, (and even those are
limited to the simple assessment of the cost of work performed), and those
which become necessary when the borrower is in serious trouble. Regular
supervision of development projects would be one of the chief functions of the
proposed Development Department.

Accounts
2.27      BMDC's accounts are reviewed annually by two "commissaires aux
comptes" appointed by the General Assembly for two-year renewable periods.
One of the commissaires is a Mauritanian accountant from a local firm, and the
other an indeperdent auditor from Tunisia. The investigations they carry out
during their annual reviews are fairly short and are geared mainly to ensuring
that the accounts are properly kept without providing any in-depth analysis
of the accounts. BMDC management has accepted the advisability of getting
BMDC's accounts audited annually by an independent firm acceptable to the
Bank. During negotiations assurances were obtained that BMDC's accounts for
the year ended December 31, 1977 shall have been audited by auditors acceptable
to IDA and received by IDA prior to credit effectiveness. Assurances were
also obtained that BMDC would continue to employ an external auditor accept-
able to IDA, and would send to IDA, BMDC's annual accounts, so audited, not
later than nine months following the end of the period to which they relate.
Loan Contracts with Clients
2.28      BMDC term loan contracts comprise standardized individual contracts
and a separate document stating its general terms and conditions. While these
documents appear satisfactory on the whole, some improvements are nonetheless
warranted to ensure that (i) imported equipment in transit is fully insured;
and (ii) proper accounts are kept by the client and sent regularly to the
lender. BMDC has agreed to introduce these requirements into future BMDC
loan contracts.
Foreign Exchange Risk
2.29      The policy statement of BMDC is totally silent on the issue of the
foreign exchange risk and BMDC has not felt the need to raise it with the
Government as its only external source of funds were Franc Zone loans raised
from CCCE when Mauritania was still in that Zone. During negotiations assur-
ances were obtained that the Government would carry the foreign exchange
risk on the proposed IDA Credit against a fee of 1% per annum to be charged
only to industrial subborrowers on the outstanding loan amount. Assurances
were also obtained that BMDC would protect itself against foreign exchange
risk on all future external borrowings by introducing an appropriate paragraph
to this effect in its policy statement.
Resources
2.30      Deposits, most of them short term, and rediscounting at the Central
Bank, make up the bulk of BMDC's resources. As of December 31, 1977, refinanc-
ing at the Central Bank provided almost 38% of BMDC's total resources, and
deposits 33.5%; the only external resource being the outstanding balances of
four CCCE loans. Shown below is a summary of BMDC's resources as of December
31, 1975 through 1977.

1/   This distribution relates to 1977
Operations
2.31      Commercial Operations.  The bulk of BMDC's operations have so far
consisted of extensive commercial lending activities, including overdrafts,
discounting of bills, financing of imports and exports, foreign-exchange
transactions, as well as personal and consumer credits. Such lending increased
from UM 75 million in 1973 to UM 693 in 1977, accounting for 72% of total
lending and 80% of revenue.
2.32      Development Operations.  An overwhelming share of term credits
provided by BMDC since its inception and particularly after 1974 have been
directed towards financing of housing construction. Out of 132 term credit
approvals totalling UM 242.7 million, during the last three years, 128 credits
totalling UM 190.6 million were for financing of housing construction. The
four remaining credits comprised two credits to industry (UM 13 million), one
to the Post Office (19.1 million) and one to the electricity company (UM 20
million). The outstanding term-credit portfolio of BMDC, as of December 31,
1977, is composed of 129 medium-term loans totalling UM 212.7 million and 46
long-term loans totalling UM 58.6 million. Both medium- and long-term loans
are heavily dominated by housing and construction loans, and have not increased
as much as the commercial operations. Loans to MIE/SIPP (para 2.21) which
started off mainly as short-term advances, have effectively developed into
substantial additional term-lending.
2.33      Equity Investments.  BMDC's equity portfolio totals UM 6.2 million
for investments in five companies, four of which are privately owned. Except
for an investment of UM 1.5 million in the capital of SOCOGIMNin 1975/76, all
the other investments were made before 1970 and comprise UM 4 million in two
fishery projects, UM 0.1 million in a tanning company and UM 0.6 million in a
construction company. All these projects are in serious difficulties. BMDC
has therefore, made a provision of UM 3.5 million against possible losses on
its equity portfolio.



- 13 -
Quality of the Portfolio
2.34      BMDC reviews its portfolio at the end of each financial year, in
order to make provisions for bad and doubtful debts. However, since it does
not carry out a systematic review of its arrears, determination of bad and
doubtful debts is essentially done on a case-by-case basis and bears little
relationship to the arrears situation. As a result, provisions cover only
those credits which have little or no chance of recovery. Moreover, since the
only criterion for determining provisions is the potential solvency of the
clients, some of its short-term credits, given to potentially solvent clients,
get rolled over from one year to the next and become in fact term credits.
Under the project BMDC would be introduced to the regular use of arrears
ratios as an instrument of continuous management review while the external
auditor will annually assess the adequacy of provisions for bad and doubtful
debts (para 2.35).
2.35      Analysis of the information compiled by BMDC indicates that loans
affected by arrears of principal and interest represent a total of UM 353.9
million or 36.7% of the total loans portfolio. Of these UM 312.8 million
are short-term credits (45.1% of short-term portfolio) and UM 41.1 million
medium- and long-term loans (15.3% of term portfolio). Effective arrears
amount to a total of UM 248.6 million of which UM 221.3 million are on
short-term credits and UM 27.3 million on medium- and long-term loans.
Arrears on short-term credits are generally for periods ranging from three
to six months, except in the case of one credit where the arrears are of close
to two years. This credit shown in the 1977 accounts at the level of UM 33.7
million is, in fact, a term credit given to an industrial project under con-
struction (MIE) (para 2.21). On term credits arrears of UM 7.3 million are
between one and two years and UM 17.7 million in excess of two years. While
specific provisions to cover defaults on medium- and long-term loans are
appropriate (UM 21.2 million or 7.8% of the total term portfolio), they are
clearly insufficient for short-term credits (UM 3.3 million or less than 0.5%
of the short-term portfolio). General provisions which amount to UM 7.7
million give a further coverage of only 1.1%. Consequently, BMDC's management
agreed that it will henceforth attach a high priority to building-up BMDC's
level of provisions and reserves, and, as a first step towards that, has
appropriated not only the total profits for 1977 to provisions, but has also
cancelled its earlier decisions to distribute dividends of UM 3.2 million on
profits for 1976, thus increasing the coverage by a further 1.2%. Institution
of the systems proposed in paragraphs 2.19 and 2.33 above should improve both
the arrears and debt situations.
Financial Position
2.36      BMDC's summarized balance sheets for the period 1973-1977 are shown
in Annex 3. Primarily as a result of a spectacular growth in commercial
operations, assets more than quadrupled between 1973 and 1977. The increase
in net worth was, however, much lower and represented a growth of only 8.6%
over the period. As a result, BMDC's overall debt/equity ratio increased
dramatically from 1.8:1 in 1973 to 11.2:1 in 1977. The term-debt equity ratio
during the period also increased substantially from 0.7:1 in 1973 to 3.2:1 in



- 14 -
1977. Consistent with BCM's guidelines, BMDC's overall debt/equity ratio is
expected to remain below 12:1, and its term debt/equity ratio not to exceed
4:1. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that these ratios would be
maintained.
Performance
2.37      BMDC's income statements for FY 1973 through FY 1977 which are
summarized in Annex 2, show that BMDC's profits, though not substantial at
present, have been increasing regularly and represented 5.5% of its net equity
in 1977 against 0.9% in 1973. Profits in 1977 would have been much higher but
for a dramatic increase in financial costs which doubled between 1976 and 1977
reflecting a stringent credit policy of the Central Bank which suspended
rediscounting for six months during 1977, and thus obliged the banks, either
to use its special advances (pension) at a much higher cost, or to pay higher
interest rates to lure deposits from their clients. Personnel and administra-
tive expenses which have grown proportionately to the growth of assets,
remain at a moderate level, representing 1.7% of the total assets. BMDC has
not distributed any dividends since its inception, and, although it recorded
substantial profits in the late sixties and early seventies, these served to
wipe out losses which it had accumulated earlier on. The new management does
not plan to distribute any profits for a few years and plans to build up
adequate reserves and provisions (para 2.34 above).
Prospects
2.38      Restrictive credit policies at present being followed by the
Central Bank, coupled with poor recoveries of its short-term loans and the
inability of BMDC to attract further deposits since the beginning of 1978, has
put BMDC in a tight liquidity position. Consequently, BMDC has been following
an extremely restrictive credit policy itself, and only approves further
lending if the resources become available from the Central Bank. It has also
neither been actively seeking projects nor encouraging its clients to propose
potential projects for financing. Its pipeline of industrial projects
is, therefore, limited to three projects costing UM 100 million requiring
financing of UM 75 million (US$1.7 million). However, if BMDC were to obtain
external resources, it could finance six additional projects identified by the
Ministry of Industry, and requiring financing of about UM 150 million (US$3.3
million). The possible artisanal brick industry, the study for which is being
financed through this project (para 1.07(e)) could be an early beneficiary
from the proposed industrial line of credit to BMDC.
2.39      Financial projections for BMDC and the assumptions on which they are
based are presented in Annexes 4 to 7. Consistent with BMDC's intended strategy
and restrictive rediscount policies of the Central Bank, these projections
assume a much slower growth rate for commercial credits than in the past and a
gradual increase in term-lending to industries. While rediscounting from BCM
and deposits from its clients are expected to cover its needs in short-term
resources for commercial lending operations, BMDC will have to mobilize about
UM 195 million ($4.3 million) in term resources (essentially for housing
finance) over the next 5 years, in addition to the proposed IDA industrial



- 15 -
line of credit. Though most of this could be covered through the Central
Bank rediscounting, BMDC plans to secure approximately half of it from as
yet unidentified external borrowings. BMDC's financial performance is
expected to remain satisfactory over the forecast period with total provi-
sions to be maintained at the level of 7% of the outstanding loans and
profits increasing to 15% of its average equity. However, in order to main-
tain the term-debt equity ratio of 4:1 (para 2.36), BMDC will have to increase
its share capital by 50% by 1982 at the latest. IFC equity participation in
BMDC (para. 2.13) would be one of the ways of achieving the capital increase.

III. THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR AND INSTITUTIONS
A. Characteristics of the Sector
3.01      The industrial sector in Mauritania is heavily dominated by mining,
which contributes 22% of GDP at factor costs and provides 24% of the total
employment in the modern sector (excluding self employment). With employment
for 4,800 persons, mining is the second largest employer after the Government.
However, it is very well catered for by other projects. Also, because of its
enclave nature (in a geographical as well as technological sense) it is
subject to several special considerations which do not apply to the rest of
the industrial sector with which this project is concerned.  The mining
subsector is therefore excluded from most of the discussion below. The rest
of the modern industrial sector (including construction) consists of about 80
modern enterprises contributing about 14% of GDP, and employing more than
6,000 people (para 3.02 below). It is located almost exclusively in the
capital, Nouakchott, and the mining and fishing port center, Nouhadibou.
3.02      Following are the known components of the modern industrial sector
in Mauritania:

The average industrial sector cost per job is thus US$130,000 for the large
public sector enterprises, and US$13,000 for the others. Column (3) includes
all the enterprises with data allowing a calculation of the investment cost



- 17 -
per job. This represents 68% of the number of enterprises and 89% of the
employment. The relatively low cost per job for industries other than the new
public industries comes from two factors: (i) it is calculated for older
enterprises, thereby masking the effects of inflation which has been high in
the construction sector, and (ii) most small enterprises, such as carpentry,
metal working, electrical, plumbing, printing or mechanical services, rent
their land or workshops instead of buying them, because construction costs are
high and adequate financing was not available for them.
3.03      The small- and medium-scale manufacturing sector faces a lot of
obstacles in Mauritania. To cite the most evident: there is a lack of
skilled people and the wages are relatively high by African standards, due to
the mining sector. Infrastructure is weak, and construction costs are among
the highest in Africa. Furthermore, this subsector was never specifically
promoted by the authorities.
3.04      Although the public sector dominates large-scale industries, most of
the small- and medium-scale industries are privately owned. At least nineteen
private sector projects were being considered for investment code privileges
as of March 31, 1978, and some others were rejected by the Ministry of Industry
as similar projects already existed, or were under consideration. In addition,
all the existing small-scale enterprises were created without applying for ex-
ternal financing or investment code benefits, but practically all such entre-
preneurs interviewed complained about avoidable administrative and financial
obstacles which hinder the development of this subsector. Also, most of the
project preparation studies examined have been of rather poor quality.
3.05      Furthermore, with its many shortages, the domestic market is open
to many import substitution activities and the existing local raw materials
are underexploited. For instance, the projected public plaster plant should
replace 40% of the present cement imports, according to its appraisal report.
In addition to the iron ore and copper, gypsum, lime, clay, salt and mineral
water are available. Prospecting for oil, nickel, uranium and phosphates is
also currently taking place.
3.06      Fish and cattle also represent opportunities for increased indus-
trialisation. The long coastal strip represents one of Mauritania's principal
sources of rapid development but the fishing industry needs to be reorganized.
Government is also considering the creation of small ports for traditional
fishers. With over 1.4 million heads of cattle, over 5 million sheep and
goats and around 1 million camels, horses and donkeys, there is potential for
the development of leather goods and other industries based on the processing
of animal hides and skins.
3.07      Five industrial zones already exist in Nouakchott:  four are satu-
rated and one is under implementation. They consist only of a piece of land
reserved for industrial purposes without any kind of infrastructure or
services. All free land is state property in Mauritania, and the industrial
plots are sold to private individuals after a study done by the "direction de
l'urbanisme" and the "direction des domaines." The plot prices in the indus-
trial zones are lower than those in residential areas and there is no effective
control of the use made of land once it is sold.



- 18 -
Government Sector Policies
3.08      There is evidence of a change in Government's industrial strategy
which has been brought about, partly by disenchantment with the many clearly
unviable large public enterprises, and partly by financial stringency (para
1.05).  Thus, the Government decided not to open the sugar refinery, although
the construction is finished, to reject other public projects, such as a milk
factory and a flour mill, and to postpone the implementation of a textile
plant. Instead, the Government is now turning more to the private sector to
relieve the widespread unemployment as it appears that all the public invest-
ments had a very high cost per job created.
The Investment Code
3.09      An investment code issued in 1976 grants a series of incentives
to industrial enterprises being established in Mauritania.  Industries in
all sectors of the economy, except commercial activities, are eligible for
these incentives. The benefits consist of tariff exemptions for imported
equipment, raw materials, and spare parts (up to 50%), and discretionary
exemptions from other taxes. In addition, the Government may provide a piece
of land when the projects are outside Nouakchott and Nouhadibou, protection
from imports, monopoly rights, exemption from export taxes, and government
assistance with infrastructure works. Enterprises are classified under three
categories, according to the amount of their investment and jobs created,
which determine the amount and the duration of the benefits:
Investment           Minimum Employ-      Maximum duration
Category      (UM million)          ment created            of benefits
A           Up to 15       and         10                  2 years
B           15 - 40                    20                  5 years
C              40                      50                  7 years
The greatest advantage of the investment code is that in granting rewards, it
takes account, not only of investment size, but also of employment creation.
It also encourages geographical dispersion of industry by granting free land
outside Nouakchott and Nouhadibou. However, the code has some serious dis-
advantages insofar as it encourages capital intensity, it is more severe than
codes in neighboring countries, it does not clearly spell out detailed provi-
sions and it does not protect beneficiary enterprises from direct duty-free
imports by some state companies. These deficiencies are discussed in greater
detail in paras 3.19 to 3.16 below.
Price and Import Controls
'Yeo protect t'he pwrcNxasi-g 'po'Ze of the popeXatAo, the Goweret
fixes the prices of approximately 50 products, has created a public enterprise
with monopoly rights, SONIMEX, to provide basic goods at reasonable prices,



- 19 -
and controls trader's commercial margins. A price control commission has been
set up under the responsibility of the Ministry of Commerce. This Ministry
also grants import licences, and its usual policy has been to grant such
licenses even if the same goods were locally produced, because they are
persuaded that it is not a good policy to protect industries which cannot face
competition.
3.11      In fact, the price control system has never been very effective,
with a lack of means for implementation, an estimated 20% of the imports
unrecorded, and an import duty free zone in the former Spanish Sahara. The
Government has taken steps to progressively abolish this duty free zone, but
the long border with Senegal, as well as the uncontrolled port landing, still
make the Mauritanian economy relatively open.
Prospects
3.12      To implement its new industrial policy, the Government is creating a
promotional unit (CEPI) under the Ministry of Industry (para 3.13). It has
already contracted for foreign technical assistance from the German Government
and from UNIDO in forms of staff and operating funds. Possible terms of
reference and modus operandi for CEPI were discussed between the responsible
ministry and IDA, and were described in a document IDA sent to the Government
after appraisal. Bank group assistance is also being sought to define a new
industrial policy based on promotion of small- and medium-scale enterprises
and to provide medium- and long-term financing.
B. Industrial Promotion Institutions
CEPI
3.13      CEPI is the main institution which would be concerned with industrial
promotion and technical assistance. Although it is still in the process of
formation, with technical assistance from Germany and UNIDO, its objectives
and terms of reference are fairly well established. Furthermore, IDA's
proposed assistance to CEPI, and the latter's proposed role in the project are
discussed in greater detail below (Chapter VI).
Functions
3.14      CEPI would be a self-contained unit, with clear and specific terms
of reference, within the Direction de l'Industrie in the Ministry of Industry.
It was agreed with the Government to retain this organisation form, at least
temporarily, rather than create a new institution because the suggested arrange-
ment would be easier to manage. CEPI's main functions would include:
-    study and appraisal of all industrial projects for which
investment code privileges are sought;
-    identification and promotion of small- and medium-scale
Mauritanian industrial enterprises;



- 20 -
provision of technical advice and management assistance
for Mauritanian industries;
performance of feasibility studies on request;
study, recommendation, and subsequent management of
new industrial zones;
training of technicians and staff for Mauritanian
industries;
-    study and establishment of a Guarantee Fund, to insure
bank loans to small- and medium-scale Mauritanian
industrial enterprises.
3.15      CEPI would not embark upon all the above functions immediately.
Which functions it tackles first will depend partly on the demands of projects
such as this, and partly on the inputs made by its initial staff. However,
initially, CEPI would be expected to perform at least project appraisal,
and the industrial zone study, even within the context of this project.
Staffing
3.16      The initial staffing would consist of:
From UNIDO, an expert whose job, over a contract period of about
six months, would consist of defining CEPI's procedures in greater detail; and
an engineering expert in small-scale enterprises, who will organize and deliver
technical assistance to Mauritanian enterprises during a one-year contract
period;
From the Federal Republic of Germany, two appraisal experts (one
an engineer, the other an economist) who will appraise all the industrial
projects to be handled by CEPI during a one-year (renewable) contract period;
one management expert on a one-year (renewable) contract, who will not only
manage CEPI, but also help in giving management advice and assistance to
Mauritanian industrial enterprises;
From Mauritania, three Mauritanian counterpart staff who will work
with and understudy the German and UNIDO technical assistance staff with a
view to taking over the running of CEPI in due course. The above staff would
later be expanded as necessary.
Financing
3.17      Initially, CEPI's budget would be financed either from technical
assistance grants (e.g. the UNIDO and German grants already contracted), and
from Government budgetary allocations. As CEPI's reputation becomes better
established, however, it would charge for appraisal and technical assistance



- 21 -
services for which its clients would have had to hire and pay private con-
sultants.
Investment Commission (IC)
3.18      The Investment Commission (para 1.08), whose sole function is to
consider and recommend enterprises to the Council of Ministers for investment
code privileges, is administratively located in the Ministry of Plan, in the
sense that a director of that Ministry acts as its secretary, and summons
meetings of the Commission from time to time. Beyond that, the Commission
has no separate existence and no staff. For the project, it would continue to
function as in the past, with reforms which would be introduced in the context
of this project (Chapter VI below). These reforms would be aimed essentially
at speeding up the Commission's processing of projects by avoiding unnecessary
duplication and delays.
C. Issues and Problems
a.   Investment Code Issues
3.19      The investment code is inappropriate in several important respects.
Firstly, the classification encourages capital intensity. As more benefits
are given for the upper categories, entrepreneurs tend to increase their
investment amount, either by strictly nonindustrial expenditure, or by unneces-
sarily capital-intensive production techniques. The employment-creation require-
ment has proved too lenient to moderate this capital intensity.
3.20      Secondly, the code seems more severe than in neighboring countries.
Senegal, Mali and Upper Volta, for instance, give total import tax concessions
over ten years to approved enterprises, plus income tax concession over five
years in Mali and Upper Volta. In addition, industrial exports are import tax
deductible in these countries, even for the nonapproved enterprises. As all
these countries are members of the same custom union (CEAO) which imposes
preferential tax rates on imports originating from member countries, these
investment code differences have a great impact on the Mauritanian industrial
sector. With, in addition, very high custom duties on imported raw materials,
the Mauritanian production is handicapped in competition with CEAO imports
mainly from Senegal, even in its own domestic market. The CEAO common tariff
makes it impossible to restore the competetiveness of Mauritanian products by
imposing appropriate import duties on finished goods originating from other
member countries.
3.21      Thirdly, the Mauritanian code is rather vague with regard to detailed
provisions. This probably allows the investment commission to give specific
benefits on a case-by-case basis, but it also prevents the entrepreneur from
knowing in advance what advantage he can count on, and can also result in
inequities between industries, and even between enterprises in the same
industry. Fourthly, given the small number of enterprises expected to qualify
for privileges, the present investment code is too complicated and should be
simplified.



- 22 -
3.22      Fifthly, important public sector agencies, such as the mining in-
dustry, the army, the road projects or the mosque constructions are exempted
from import dutfies  This exposes Mauritanian small- and medium-scale enter-
p-rses w'fich c&u d  ave supplied these important public sectors to the full
blast of foreign competition without even normal tariff protection, and means
a loss ofr most of the market they would have supplied.  As a condition of
effectiveness of the proposed Credit, Goverrment has agreed to amend the
investment code according to new draft proposals agreed with the Association.
b.   Industrial Zoning Issues
3.23      Once land is allocated to an approved industry, there is little
control over its use, with the result that the industrial zones are only
theoretical. Land speculation is rife and many traders ask for lots in the
Lndustrial zones to build houses for rent. In addition, as all infrastructure
and utilities are financed by the buyer, the real industrialists have to pay
very high costs for access roads and utilities, even before starting the
construction of a factory, Furthermore, as the demand for land is very high
in industrial zones, they have to wait between six months and one year before
receiving an allocation. The new industrial zone under implementation is not
different from the previous ones, and as the chosen land is located between
two residential areas, one can expect the same speculation, with little or no
room for the zone's expansion. This project would therefore include proposals
to create a better conceived and controlled industrial zone (para 1.07(e)).
c.   Industrial Financing Issues
3.24      In the present budget difficulties (para 1.05) the Government has
had frequent recourse to the banking system including the Central Bank, mainly
for public sector projects. This has greatly reduced the credit available to
the private sector. Furthermore, there is no organized system or special
resource to assure medium- and long-term financing for small- and medium-scale
industries other than Central Bank rediscounting. Most of them have therefore
faced serious liquidity problems, many work below their capacity level, and
some of them had to close or to lay off workers, at least temporarily.
d.   Government Administrative Coordination and Delays
3.25      There appears to be inadequate direct contact between the Ministries
of Commerce, Industry and Finance, all of which are concerned with developments
in the industrial sector. One of the reforms that would be built into this
project would be that the commercial aspects of projects be also analyzed by
the CEPI, and that the Ministry of Commerce be represented in the Investment
Commission, which has not been the case till now.
3.26      One of the most difficult problems facing those entrepreneurs who
may be qualified for investment code privileges is the long delay between the
initial application for such privileges and a final decision from the Investment
Commission. A project is first registered and analyzed by the Ministry of
Industry, then by the Ylinistry of Planning, which calls a meeting of the
Investment Commission when three projects are ready to be submitted, and the
final decision is taken by the Council of Ministers. In general, the time



- 23 -
between the project registration and the final decision takes one year. This
is generally too long for most businessmen to wait in order to find out
whether or not their proposed enterprises would benefit from code privileges.
An important objective of this project, therefore, would be to reduce this
period by streamlining procedures and eliminating delays.
IV. THE ARTISAN SECTOR AND INSTITUTIONS
A. The Sector
Main Characteristics
4.01      There are approximately 48,000 artisans constituting 9% of the
active population, working with metal, leather, wool and clay to produce both
utilitarian goods (clothes, tools) for daily household use, and art objects
(ornaments). Sixteen thousand of these are men working full time, mainly, on
metal goods and 32,000 are women working on leather or wool. Some women work
full time, others only part time. In 1975 these artisans contributed about UM
600 million (US$13 million) or 5% of GDP, and this percentage of contribution
to GDP is not thought to have changed appreciably since 1975.
4.02      The number of male artisans appears to have remained constant due
to a vestigial result of the caste system which prevents people of other
castes (marabout, warrior, etc.) from joining the trade and also prevents
cross-mobility between the various artisan groups. Increasing numbers of
women appear to be interested in starting commercial production of carpets,
associated with women's traditional work. The effect of severe droughts which
had been plaguing the country since the early 70s, the resulting necessity of
finding a livelihood other than livestock and agricultural production, and the
limited absorptive capacity of the modern sectors are all creating an acute
shortage of employment among refugees flocking to the capital or to rural
centers.
4.03      Although the number of artisans as a whole is increasing, the
artisan trade is becoming extremely difficult for several reasons, including
competition from imports and foreign workers, difficulty in getting raw
materials, poor organization of production, and changing consumer tastes. The
production of utilitarian goods is in decline. Imported metal works, agricul-
tural tools, pots and cutlery are preferred because they are less expensive.
Many utilitarian goods are produced by Senegalese, Malian and Guinean tailors,
shoemakers, mattress makers and carpenters, while a majority of Mauritanian
male artisans has become specialized in production of jewelry and ornaments.
But even here, archaic production techniques, lack of raw materials, and an
inefficient marketing system result in low productivity, high costs and a
stagnant demand.
4.04      Most women producing handicrafts are not members of the artisan
caste, except for those in leather work and tanning which have been tradi-
tionally done by the women of that caste. Locally-made functional footwear



- 24 -
has been replaced by imports. Weaving of domestic wool and camel hair into
tents, blankets, and rugs has been practised by nomadic women for centuries.
It is probably this traditional training which facilitated the training of
Mauritanian women for producing knotted carpets when it was introduced by
a Tunisian technical assistant in 1965. Within two years the quality, quantity,
and local demand for them were such that the Government decided to promote its
production officially by setting up Office Mauritanien du Tapis (OMT) which
later became Office Mauritanien d'Artisanat (OMA) (see below para 4.09).
Government Policy
4.05      The artisan sector (apart from carpet weaving) has been relatively
neglected in Mauritania until recently. A number of reasons explains this.
Firstly, since Independence, the artisan sector suffered from the same official
neglect as did the small- and medium-scale enterprises. Secondly, since
artisans are dispersed throughout the country, it is difficult to set up an
organization which could help them with financing, marketing, getting raw
materials, or giving technical assistance. Simultaneously with the transfor-
mation of OMT into OMA, and in order to extend assistance to artisans beyond
the carpet weavers, the Government encouraged formation of pre-cooperatives
in the early 1970s, but without adequate technical or financial support.
While 27 pre-cooperatives (groups of artisans), excluding ones producing
knotted carpets, sprung up, the number has steadily declined until at present
it seems there are only about 12 left. The decrease is attributed to all the
problems discussed in this paragraph.
4.06      While the Government is assisting the marketing of some artisanal
products through OMAT, its most active assistance to artisans is limited to
the carpet industry for the following reasons:
(i) carpet weaving, already a well-known traditional craft,
appeared to offer an opportunity for creating a great
number of employment opportunities.
(ii) Demand exists among local people, foreigners living in
Mauritania, foreigners in the neighboring West African
countries, as well as in Europe for middle quality
Mauritanian carpets. The carpet industry, therefore,
showed the greatest promise of providing a large enough
market to make the necessary impact on employment.
Carpet Industry
4.07      In 1966, the National Organization for Women (Association pour
la Promotion de la Femme par le Travail) opened a training center (Centre de
Formation Professionelle et Menagere) with the help of Tunisian and ILO
technical assistance to train women to produce hand-knotted carpets similar to
those produced in North Africa and the Middle East. The experience was so
successful that in June 1968 the Government founded the "Office Mauritanien du
Tapis" (QGUT), which transfortmed the above center into an autonomous public
enterprise with industrial and commercial character. OMT imported wool from
abroad, provided rented workshops, looms and equipment, trained women at



- 25 -
weaving knotted carpets, bought the finished products and marketed them. The
women were grouped into four State-owned workshops, two in Nouakchott nd one
each in Boutilimit and Atar. By 1972, the production reached 3,000 m per
annum, and the trained weavers numbered 220. The quality of the product was
highly appreciated both abroad where they were displayed in international
expositions and were usually sold out, and at Nouakchott, by the foreign
community and Government personnel. However, production has not kept up with
expanding demand due to poor management, poor organization of raw material
supply, poor liquidity, and consequently a decrease in the number of weavers,
and deterioration of morale.
4.08      In an attempt to improve production and training, as well as to
extend assistance to other artisans, the Government transformed OMT in 1973
into Office Mauritanien D'artisanat (OMA). Provision of raw materials,
organization of production and marketing of carpets remained the principal
responsibility of OMA. While it was planned to extend similar assistance to
other artisans, OMA limited itself initially to marketing as far as services
to other artisanal trades were concerned. Training of carpet weavers, however,
was separated from production and the "Centre de Formation de l'Artisanat du
Tapis" (CFAT) was established.  Yet, liscontent2 continued:  since 1974,
production fell to half (from 3,000 m - 1,500 m per year) and never recovered;
the number of weavers decreased constantly until it reached 115, in spite of
the fact that 100 had been trained and graduated from CFAT since 1976.
Failing in improvement of carpet production, OMA has not been able to extend
assistance to other artisans. The Mauritanian Government and all the institu-
tions concerned with the artisan sector therefore feel more strongly than ever
the need to improve the efficiency of this sector.
B. The Artisan Institutions
CFAT and OMA
4.09      The history of official assistance to carpet-weaving artisans has been
essentially that of CFAT which was responsible for training in carpet weaving,
and OMA which assisted carpet weavers with workshop accommodation, production
and marketing. Early in 1979, Government, in an effort to improve the coordi-
nation of artisan training and assistance, created Office Mauritanien de
l'Artisanat et du Tourisme (OMAT). This institution centralizes in a single
agency all the government activities related to the promotion and development
of the artisan and tourism sectors. CFAT and OMA have ceased to exist as
separate institutions. CFAT has become the Artisan Training Department, and
OMA the Carpet Production Department, in the new organization OMAT. Therefore,
although all the artisan institutional activities described in this section
were carried out by CFAT and OMA, the latter will be referred to throughout
under their new names within the OMAT organization.



- 26 -
OMM
4.10      Under the tutelage of the Ministry of Transport, Posts and Tele-
communications, irtisans and Tourism, OMAT has been charged with the respons=
ibility for:
-    promotion of tourism, including publicity, training of
officials, classification of hotels and restaurants,
management of hotels, and coordination of the activities
of all tourism organizations;
-    promotion and development of artisans, including domestic
and export marketing of artisan products, artisan training,
raw material supply, quality and price controls, formation
of artisan cooperatives, and preservation of artisan
archives; and
-    organization of, and participation in, fairs inside and
outside Mauritania.
4.11      OMAT is managed by a Board of Directors which determines policy,
and an Executive Committee which implements it. The Board includes a President
plus representatives of each of the Ministries responsible for Finance, Plan,
Artisan and Tourism, and Protection of Nature, as well as representatives of
the Central Bank, the National Center for Veterinary Research, the Association
of Artisan Groups and Pre-cooperatives, hotel owners, and the Mauritanian
Workers Union. The Executive Committee consists of the manager, his assistant,
and the accountant. The president, directors, manager and assistant manager
are all appointed by the parent Ministry, whereas the accountant is appointed
by the Ministry of Finance.
4.12      The design of OMAT 's organizational structure is still being
finalized, as the exact extent and implications of its responsibilities
become clearer. In the meantime, it operates through four departments dealing
respectively with Administration and Finance, Artisan Training, Carpet Pro-
duction, and Tourism Management and Promotion.
4.13      Financing for OMAT activities is provided from:
-    payments received by OMAT for its services;
-    subsidies from the State and public organizations; and
-    extraordinary receipts, such as gifts.
OMAT's annual budget has to be approved by both the parent Ministry and the
Ministry of Finance. Both Ministries also have equal responsibility for
approving acceptance of gifts, purchases or sales of fixed assets, borrowing
and granting of guarantees, and use of reserves.



- 27 -
The Artisan Training Department
4.14      Until 1978, the department's (formerly CFAT's) annual budget was
approximately US$110,000 and was entirely subsidized by the State. This low
budget was partly responsible for the relative ineffectiveness of the depart-
ment. The st-lents' allowances (UM 2,000 each) were financed by the State for
50 students and by UNICEF for the remaining 50. The three-year training
program with four months of annual unpaid vacation, consisted of theories of
carpet weaving, maquette reading and practical training in weaving. In
addition, two out of eight hours every day were spent learning reading,
writing, arithmetic, Arabic and French. These courses were taught by temporary
teachers volunteering their services.
4.15      The aim of this training was to enable the women to become weavers
with minimum managerial capacity so that they could create production units of
their own. However, the training program was clearly not gedred to achieving
the objective. In 1976, 88 out of 100 students successfully completed their
training, but only 20 of them took up carpet production because of the lack
of adequate facilities; the others became secretaries and administrators.
Because of the high rate of dropouts, UNICEF stopped its financing scholar-
ships in 1977. Thus, the department has at present only 50 students for its
second class of training which will be completed in June 1979. There is,
thus, a clear need to review student recruitment policies, curriculum content,
and career prospects of students. Such a critical review would form an
essential part of this project.
The Carpet Production Department
4.16      This department (formerly OMA) was receiving an annual subsidy of
US$77,340 equivalent. Its capital was US$61,000. Its projected annual budget
in 1978 was approximately US$315,000. It was always in deficit due to arrears
in payment by the state which was its biggest customer. (In October 1977,
arrears of the state amounted to 20% of its annual budget or approximately
$62,000.) Consequently, Government has recently undertaken to pay off all
amounts due to the department. Also, assurances were obtained at negotiations
that OMAT credit carpet sales would in the future be paid for within three
months.
4.17      The department's three rented workshops, which produce the only
knotted carpets in Mauritania, are made available to weavers free of charge.
Practically all the carpet weavers are women. The department provides two
supervisors who control the puality of carpets, and fou5 "maneuvers."  A
weaver earns about $50 per m and produces about 2.18 m per month. Thus,
she earns approximately $109 per month which is considerably higher than
both the average artisan earnings ($67) and the minimum wage for skilled labor
($95). The carpets are sold at $112 per m yielding on the average 23% profit
for the department. While this price is high for the medium quality carpets
(40,000 knots), demand for the cFrpet is constantly exceeding supply. Produc-
tion is at present about 1,500 m a year.



- 28 -
4.18      There are, therefore, apparent obstacles which have been preventing
artisan institutions from achieving the objectives for which they were created.
A very important part of the artisan component of this project would consist
of removing these obstacles through reforms in procedures, financing, staffing
and technical assistance. Such project reforms would be implemented by the
new organization OMAT (para 4.09).
C. Issues and Problems
4.19      The original reasons which made Government select carpet weaving
as its most promising area of intervention in the artisan sector remain as
valid today as they were in 1966. However, the two major issues facing the
subsector are:
-    how to attract and retain carpet weavers through changes
in their selection and training; and
-    how to improve the whole prospect and productivity of the
carpet industry by removing the organization, management,
liquidity, raw material and marketing problems.
The main justification of the artisan component of this project is that it
would go a long way towards resolving these issues.
V. THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR AND INSTITUTIONS
A. The Agricultural Sector
General Characteristics
5.01      Agriculture in Mauritania has been dominated up to the present by
stockraising, with a herd of 1,400,000 beef cattle and 5,200,000 sheep and
goats in 1973 (compared to 2,450,000 beef cattle and 6,600,000 sheep and goats
in 1970, before the effects of the drought were felt). There has been some
stability since 1973, but the 1977 drought may have further reduced the herds.
The severe irregularity of the rainfall makes rainfed cultivation risky.
Consequently, apart from flood plain farming, which depends on the extent of
flooding, all stable agriculture is based on irrigation.
5.02      Production of millet and sorghum is about 60,000 tons, covering
only 75% of the requirements, while rice production meets barely 15% of
the requirements. The Gorgol pilot project which went into production in
1977, contributes only about 500 tons at most. The thirty-four small irri-
gated areas financed by FED between Kaedi and Rosso should make a noteworthy
contribution during 1978, despite the impossibility of growing a second crop
on most of this land, owing to the salinity of the river at low water.



- 29 
Expected production is about 2,500 tons of paddy for the next harvest. The
M'Pourie 1,000 ha rice project adds another 4,000 tons a year.
5.03      It thus appears, even taking into account some 20 very small private
holdings along the river, that there is still a sufficient demand to justify
the extension of rice growing, both under the Gorgol and Boghe projects, and
through the establishment of new small areas whose contribution will be
particularly important in the event of a repetition of disastrous droughts.
The project under review which expects to result in creation of 30 additional
village irrigation schemes, involves a population sufficiently numerous to
ensure full utilization of the area developed, which will not exceed 600 ha,
and the additional expected production falls well within the limits of the
food deficit to be met by all projects that can be carried out within a fairly
short period.
Subsector: Development of Village Irrigation Schemes (Map No. 13918)
5.04      The project zone consists of a narrow band extending along the right
bank of the Senegal River for about 200 km, from Selibaby upstream to Kaedi
downstream. This bank covers about 25,000 ha, most of which is not subject to
flooding by the river.
5.05      Some 40 villages are spread along the river bank or in the immediate
vicinity, making their living from rainfed farming (dieri), floodplain farming
(oualo) and, chiefly, stockraising. The population, comprising mainly Ouolof
and Toucouleur tribesmen, is sedentary. In several places it was augmented by
Peuhl herdsmen during the recent severe droughts. A precise estimate of the
population resident in the project zone is difficult to make, in the absence
of detailed surveys taking into account the migration that has occurred,
especially because of drought. It seems, however, that the present total
population of the zone is between 3,000 and 3,500 families, i.e., 25,000 to
30,000 persons. It may therefore be assumed that the project, involving some
1,800 families, will affect approximately 15,000-about one-half of the rural
population of the region.
Climatological and Soil Data
5.06      The climate of the project zone is of the pure Sahelian type.
Average annual rainfall concentrated in a short season (July to October),
varies from 420 mm at Kaedi to 550 near Selibaby. Average temperature (centi-
grade) ranges from 23.40 in January to 34.20 in May.  The cold season from
December to February virtually precludes the planting of out-of-season rice
before the latter date, but does permit the growing of wheat or maize from
December to March. Relative humidity, high from July to December when the
average is between 51% and 73%, is low in March and April because of the hot
dry winds (harmattan). Potential evapotranspiration is high, but the short
rainy season limits rainfed farming (dieri) to very short cycl-e crops (e.g.
millet). The climate of the project area favors double cropping with rice,
provided that the out-of-season rice is harvested by June at the latest, to
permit planting of rice in season around July.



- 30 -
5.07      The soils of the project zone consist of basin clays and level
soils. Their texture is average, ranging from clay to sandy-loamy. These
soils are suitable for most annual or perennial irrigated crops. Since rice
is the main crop, village irrigated schemes should be located on heavier
soils.
Water Resources and Water Rights
5.08      All village irrigation schemes (VIS) rely on water pumped from the
river.  The peas requirement of the wet Ieason crops for the entire area of
600 ha is 1.8 m Is as compared with 50 m Is (probability higher than 90%)
available in the Senegal river on July 1st. In the critical period at the end
of the dry season crop (240 ha) the water requirement is about 20% of the
lowest flow in May. Besides, the storage corresponding to the river bed
aquifer gives an additional guarantee of water availability in this period.
The potential for irrigation in the Mauritanian part of the Senegal river
valley is estimated at 140,000 ha, whereas total irrigated area to date is
around 2000 ha, and Government plans to irrigate 10,000 ha by 1980 (including
this project) are considered highly optimistic. To increase water availability
even further, especially during the dry season, OMVS is planning to build at
least one large storage dam. Thus, this project's development of 30 VIS
covering 600 ha would fit well into the Government's development plan, the
water availability, and OMVS' plans for the overall development of the region.
Before the new additional storage is effective, double cropping would not be
practised in the existing irrigation schemes downstream. Therefore, the
water diverted for VIS in the dry season will not be harmful to the interests
of Senegal. However, since the use of the Senegal River waters is governed by
the Convention of March 11, 1972 between Mauritania, Senegal and Mali, the
Mauritanian Government has informed the OMVS Council of Ministers of the
allocation of water for the project.
5.09      There is no problem of water salinity in the project zone, since the
bottom at Kaedi (downstream limit) has a sufficiently positive height (about
4.00 m).  The limit of the influence of tides, and therefore the limit of
diffusion of salinity at low water is at Boghe, about 200 km downstream from
Kaedi.
Government Policies and Activities
5.10      Government's policy towards the project zone has been generally to
encourage self-help irrigation of small plots along the Senegal river bank,
and thus increase food production, while reducing rural-urban migration, at
minimum cost to the State treasury. It has sought to achieve this mainly
through self-governing farmers' cooperatives, which run the entire agricul-
tural operation with the assistance and advice of the Societe National pour
le Developpement Rural (SONADER) (which, itself, benefits from considerable
external assistance including IDA), and the Directorate of Agriculture in the
Ministry of Rural Development.



- 31 -
5.11      The Ministry carried out a first operation of this type from 1972 to
1977. A total of 14 areas were developed between Kaedi and Rosso (i.e.,
downstream from the project zone), covering 360 ha. This operation, financed
by the European Development Fund (FED) with subsequent rehabilitation by IBRD,
served as an experiment to define and improve methods of action, especially in
the manpower a-ea. For this reason, the areas actually cultivated varied
widely from 1972 to 1975 with respect to the areas equipped, and average
yields calculated on the basis of the latter ranged from 3 t/ha to 5.5 t/ha
during the rainfed farming season. Overall, average yields per area were
between 5 and 5.5 t/ha in 1976 and between 4.5 and 5.5 t/ha in 1977. The
operation was directed by three foreign experts until 1977. Two foreign
experts remain in 1978 acting as technical advisors.
5.12      In 1977 SONADER itself undertook a program of 19 VIS covering about
388 ha, also between Kaedi and Rosso. The first five areas were completed and
brought under cultivation in 1977, drawing upon the lessons learned earlier.
The operation is being financed with bilateral technical cooperation from
France, (FAC), for capital investments as well as technical assistance. This
project will be completed in 1978. The report of the operation published in
March 1978 shows that the entire area equipped in time for a rainfed crop -
61.5 ha - has produced 293 tons of paddy, i.e., 4.75 t/ha. The average yield
was actually 5.4 t/ha for 53 ha.
5.13      On the basis of the valuable experience gained during the FED
operation, and in its own projects, SONADER has technical competence ensuring
its ability to undertake a larger-scale operation beginning in 1979 under
satisfactory conditions. The conclusions and recommendations presented in
this report take this experience into account, proposing adaptations or
modifications in order to correct certain problems pointed out by FED and
SONADER experts.
B. Agriculture Institutions
a.   SONADER
5.14      Government set up SONADER in 1975 as the project implementation
organization of the Ministry of Rural Development. SONADER, therefore, has
only three years of past history, even though it has demonstrated considerable
competence and initiative during that period. Although it functions as an
autonomous unit, it is answerable to its parent Ministry.
Functions
5.15      SONADER's work program for 1978 and 1979 accurately reflects its
functions. They include the development of the 19-village irrigation schemes
(VIS) being financed by FAC and the 30 proposed for IDA financing; the Gorgol
700 ha rice pilot project, including a new rice threshing mill and technical
assistance; the Boghe project, and various studies for irrigated sugar as well
as other projects at M'Bagne, Maghama and Koundi. In addition to coordinating



- 32 -
all the above activities, SONADER's headquarters will also construct a central
workshop and an instruction center.
Organization (Chart I)
5.16      SONADER, which has its own Board of Directors, is organized in five
main departments, viz: administration and finance, studies and works, project
implementation, national laboratory for soil analysis, and coordination of
projects and land use. Despite some vagueness in the dividing line between
the functions of some of these departments, the organization has worked well
so far, mainly because of the still small size of SONADER activities. With
proposed expansion, however, responsibilities will need to be more clearly
defined. All departments answer to the Managing Director, who is answerable
to both his Board of Directors and the Ministry of Rural Development.
Staffing and Technical Assistance
5.17      SONADER employs 72 persons, including 22 senior professionals, 10
of whom are expatriates of whom 7 are financed by IDA (Credit No. 694) and
three by FAC, FED and other aid agencies. There is a Mauritanian counterpart
for each expatriate staff member, and with the projects now being planned, the
counterparts are likely to gain a lot of experience in the launching of new
projects, which remains the primary role of SONADER.
Financing
5.18      SONADER was launched with an initial capital of UM 27 million
subscribed entirely by Government. There was also a budgetary allocation of
UM 30 million in 1977. The latter was described as a loan, but is likely to
end up as part of the fixed capital. For 1978, SONADER expected a State
budgetary allocation of UM 40 million.  The largest single source of external
finance has so far been IDA with a US$3.5 million loan, equivalent to UM 157.5
million for technical assistance. Other foreign sources comprise a total of
UM 2.5 million in gifts mainly from Canada, USA and the Federal Republic of
Germany.
b.   Farmer's Village Cooperative Societies
5.19      Practically all existing Village Irrigation Schemes (VIS) are owned
by farmers' cooperative societies, varying in size from about 20 to 60 farmers.
These are self-governing societies in which the farmers have come together to
pool their resources in exploiting a VIS, receiving technical assistance from
SONADER and external donor agencies, and to own or operate a water pump in
common. Payment of an entry fee is generally a precondition of membership,
and communal expenses of the society are financed through annual levies or
subscriptions.
5.20      Each society's day-to-day affairs, e.g., allocation of plots,
communal work, choice of crops, work schedule, accounting, etc., are controlled
by an elected committee under an elected president with well-defined authority.
SONADER services to farmers are delivered under the terms of detailed contracts



- 33 -
signed by both the President and Committee on behalf of each society, and by
each farmer. Societies have a right to exclude any member for nonpayment of
dues or other infringement of cooperative rules. Membership in a village
cooperative society would be a precondition of farmer participation in this
project.
C. Sector Issues and Problems
5.21      The sector issues connected with the future agricultural development
of the project area have to do with:
-    the relationship between SONADER and farmers with regard
to ownership of, and responsibility for, assets;
-    the lack of a proper agricultural credit scheme;
-    SONADER's cost-recovery policies;
-    the problems posed by rice marketing.
5.22      Until now, SONADER's role has been to set up and supervise practically
all new agricultural projects. This has worked well so far, mainly because
there have not been too many such projects to supervise. However, as more
projects are developed by SONADER, it will be necessary to make each project
as self-sufficient and independent of Government supervision and financing as
possible, at least after the initial development stage.
5.23      In the small village irrigation schemes (VIS) already set up, both
the ownership of the irrigation pumps and other equipment, and financial
responsibility for the operations are unclear. In most cases SONADER retains
ownership of equipment, but farmers are charged for its depreciation. In
these circumstances, farmers do not consider themselves responsible for the
equipment.
5.24      Also, the absence of a proper credit scheme adds to the uncertainties
regarding the financial responsibility. For future projects, it is proposed
to transfer ownership of all equipment to approved farmers from the beginning,
but provide them with credit to purchase it. Seasonal credit would also be
provided for agricultural inputs.
5.25      A problem associated with the lack of a formal or well-established
agricultural credit scheme is that what costs SONADER recovers from farmers
seems to be determined ad hoc, and on a case by case basis. This results in
inequities as between one group of farmers and another, quite apart from
posing problems for SONADER in seeking to administer several funds on different
terms to farmers. The formal credit scheme proposed under this project would
reduce this problem if it would be also applied to future schemes without
interfering with the right of other donors to specify the terms and conditions
of their own financing.



- 34 -
5.26      Rice marketing presented considerable problems for existing villages
in recent years. There were no large mechanical threshers in the villages.
Hand threshing (by pestle and mortar) was so slow that the task was prolonged,
and often interfered with other subsequent agricultural activities (e.g.,
off-season cultivation). There were also no large rice buyers close to most
of the villages, and the state organization charged with responsibility for
the marketing of smallholder rice frequently ran out of funds and could,
therefore, not fulfill its responsibilities. For these reasons, SONADER has
taken over responsibility for rice marketing in those villages under its
control, and this arrangement will be essential in any future VIS.
VI. THE PROJECT
6.01      The Project, as described in its concept in paragraphs 1.06 and 1.07
will include three different components of technical and financial assistance
to the SME Industrial sector, astisans and farmers.
A. Project Assistance for the Industrial Sector
6.02      The project proposes a line of credit of US$2.1 million to finance
small- and medium-scale industries (para 6.07 below). However, more important
for the sector are IDA suggestions for improvements to Government procedures
and the investment code as well as institution building through technical as-
sistance to BMDC.
6.03      More specifically, in addition to the industrial line of credit
(para 6.02) the project would provide US$376,000 for a total of three man
years of technical assistance to BMDC to enable it to establish a Development
Department devoted primarily to industrial project identification, appraisal
and supervision. US$37,000 would also be provided for extra costs of foreign
training for BMDC senior staff including the Mauritanian counterpart for the
proposed technical assistant (para 2.24).
6.04      Government officials agreed that while CEPI should appraise all
industrial projects regardless of size, it should also be completely respons-
ible for the presentation of industrial projects costing less than UM 200
million to the Investment Commission, the Ministry of Plan being responsible
for the larger projects (above the ceiling). BMDC should submit all its
projects to CEPI for appraisal of aspects in which BMDC has no in-house
competence (e.g., engineering), while CEPI should submit its projects in
search of financing in priority to BMDC without any obligation on either side
that BMDC would necessarily finance the project. The Director of Industry
should be a member of the BMDC credit committee, and meetings between CEPI and
BMDC should be organized on a regular basis to coordinate the appraisal
policies.



35 -
6.05      Government officials also agreed to the sitdplification of the pro-
cedures and the investment code in the following ways:
-    the code's categories would be abolished and total import
tax exemptions granted for all approved enterprises, or
failing that, the present system would be replaced by
a single tax lower than, or at least not higher than
CEAO taxes, for all the enterprises with an investment
amount below a ceiling of US$2 million. Investments above
this amount could be accorded further privileges subject
to negotiation and would be embodied in a special agreement
(described in Mauritania as "convention") on a case-by-case
basis.
-    in order to simplify the procedures and to strengthen the
Investment Commission (IC), the latter would be entitled
to take the final approval decision for enterprises below the
above mentioned ceiling, after a study done by the CEPI
(see below). Over this amount, the decision would remain
in the hands of the Council of Ministers on recommendations
of the IC. The latter would also be composed of designated
representatives of all concerned institutions and meet on a
regular basis to study not only ready projects, but also the
projects under appraisal by CEPI. CEPI would also be
entitled to control both the application of the investment
code and the implementation of projects approved under
that code.
6.06      The measures in paras 6.04 and 6.05 above, or alternative measures
satisfactory to IDA for removing the bottlenecks which those measures are
designed to remove, would be implemented prior to credit effectiveness.
6.07      As the primary objective of this component is employment creation
at minimum investment cost, certain criteria would be applied to ensure
maximum labor intensity in the Mauritanian context. Thus, firstly, the
beneficiaries from the line of credit would have initial or incremental
project investment not exceeding UM 45 million (US$1 million). Secondly, 40%
of the line of credit would be devoted to high job creation projects which are
projects likely to result in a cost per job no higher than UM 337,500 (US$7,500).
These     beneficiaries would be able to borrow from the IDA line of credit up
to 90% of estimated total project cost. This percentage would cover the whole
foreign exchange component and a substantial part of local cost component of
the project. Thirdly, 60% of the line of credit would be devoted to average
job creation projects which are projects having a cost per job above $7,500
but not exceeding $25,000. Beneficiaries of this category would be able to
borrow up to 75% of total project cost which would represent on the average



- 36 -
100% of the foreign cost component. 1/ Assurances were obtained at negotia-
tions that the lending limits prescribed in this paragraph would be applied.
Studies
6.08      The project would finance studies for:
-    A new industrial zone in Nouakchott (US$60,000); and
-    a gypsum plaster brick industry to replace expensive
imported cement with locally-made bricks (US$30,000).
Government has identified the lack of a properly-equipped industrial zone
in Nouakchott as a major industrial sector constraint. Consequently, the
project would finance a feasibility study by CEPI for a new industrial zone
providing all essential facilities under CEPI management. IDA would review
and approve terms of reference before the study starts.
6.09      The possibility of a gypsum plaster brick industry has, for several
years, been regarded as the most promising way to relieve one of the most
serious development problems in Mauritania, namely, the extremely high cost of
construction. The latter, one of the highest in Africa, is largely due to the
complete absence of locally-produced building material other than sand and
water. It has been suggested that replacement of imported cement with locally-
made bricks could appreciably reduce construction costs. Consequently, the
project would finance a study (by Swiss consultants ADAUA and French architects,
Menard and Gelfi) under the Government housing institution SOCOGIM, of the
possibility of producing bricks in one or two small artisanal units using
gypsum readily available in Nouakchott. Subject to a satisfactory finding by
this study, the resulting artisanal brick industry could be one of the small-
scale industries to benefit from the industrial line of credit described above.
B. Project Assistance for the Artisan Sector
6.10      The project would be aimed at rehabilitating and expanding knotted
carpet production by improving training of weavers and decentralizing produc-
tion over a period of three years.
6.11      The training program would be reduced from three years to two years
with only two months of vacation. A 12-month period of consultancy would be
1/   BMDC's exposure limit (para 2.21) would be respected at all times,
notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph. Therefore projects
requiring financing in excess of the permissible exposure limit would
be cofinanced from other sources.



- 37 -
financed by the project.  Seven months would be used to formulate a training
program which will above all, train the students to be weavers and not secre-
taries, but also give them a minimum of reading, writing and arithmetic so
that they can eventually keep books when they have their own production unit.
The consultant would also assist for a few months in the initial implementa-
tion of the revised curricula, but might be invited back from time to time to
follow up and modify the training program as needed. At a total cost of
US$648,000 over three years, OMAT would double its student capacity (from
100 to 200) and train 300 weavers, the last 100 of whom would complete their
training in Year 4.
Carpet Production
6.12      Production, which would be by traditional labor-intensive techniques,
would be decentralized, and private production units set up. New graduates as
well as those among the old wishing to get out from the state workshop would
be able to form groups of eight. A grant of US$60,000 from the IDA credit
would allow OMAT to provide one loom with related equipment per group as
medium-term credit in kind. OMAT would also receive out of the IDA credit
additional resources of US$223,000 to finance continuous supply of raw materials.
These two amounts would constitut  a revolving fund for OMAT.  Construction
of 36 small workshops (about 40 m each) costing US$478,000 to house these
groups would be directly financed by the IDA credit and would become the
property of the State, although maintenance would be the occupants' responsi-
bility. These workshops would be built near the homes of the women, so that
transportation would not be a problem. The production units would be monitored
and counseled by three Mauritanian technical assistants who would receive six
months of training abroad under the project. In addition, OMAT management
would be strengthened by a manager (3 man years of technical assistance) who
would search for cheap sources of raw materials and develop markets. He would
also assist three Mauritanian technical assistants in supervising and advising
on the financial management of production units. This technical assistance
aspect is far more important than the relatively small revolving fund for
credit to artisans.
6.13      These training and production improvements proposed under the pro-
ject are expected to resylt in an increase2of total annual carpet production
from the current 1,500 m to about 7,800 m by Year 5. Even if only the
project's 300 graduates benefit from the production expenditure, those 300
jobs would be created at US$2,600 a job: a considerable improvement on the
US$33,000 a job currently occurring in the industrial sector (Chapter III).
In fact, many more carpet weavers than the 300 project graduates are likely
to benefit from the production element of project expenditures.
6.14      The large and unsatisfied demand for Mauritanian hand-woven carpets
is symptomized by chronic inability to satisfy outstanding orders, and the
long waiting list for these carpets both within and outside the country.
Part of the objective of this project would, therefore, be to better organize
production so as to satisfy more of this existing market. In addition, part



- 38 -
of the work of the expert to be recruited for the production aspect would be
to develop new markets and establish a pipeline of steady orders. Assurances
were obtained at negotiations that OMAT would buy at a previously guaranteed
price all carpets presented to it by carpet weaving groups, deduct from
the proceeds money owed to OMAT by the weavers, and pay the balance to the
weavers; and, that the price should be such as2to leave the weaver with a net
return of not less than UM 2,250 (US$50) per m after paying all his weaving
expense and debts to OMAT. Itemized costs of project assistance to artisans
are in Anuex 1, Table 4, while calculations of financial and economic rates of
return on this component are detailed in Annex 10.
C. Project Assistance for the Agricultural Sector
6.15      The project would assist SONADER in establishing 30 new irrigated
farms under village cooperatives controlling individual lots. It would also
enable SONADER to provide the first thorough-going agricultural credit system
in Mauritania, and would include:
(a) A long-term (10 years, including one year of grace) loan to
each cooperative covering the cost of two horizontal centrifugal
pumps, each with a single impeller and a motor capable of
producing 34 hp at 1450 t/minute and a flow of 240 m /hr
for a dynamic head with a height of about 10 meters,
ancillary equipment, their transport and installation,
as well as costs of mechanics vehicle and tools, and the
cost of farmers subsistence during construction of
irrigation channels; and
(b) a short-term (normally twelve months) revolving credit
covering fertilizer, insecticide and seed, as well as
fuel, lubricants, and spares used by the cooperatives
pumps (see Annex 12).
All credit would be in kind. Credit repayments to SONADER would be used to
set up a permanent revolving credit fund to repeat the operation in these and
other areas. The only costs not recoverable from the farmers would be costs
of SONADER's own staff vehicles and office equipment, construction advice and
foreign technical assistance (all being financed through this project) which
have traditionally been provided "gratis" to all farmers in the country and
financed through the national budget (see Annex 1). Assurances were obtained
at negotiations that the credit and cost recovery provisions described in
this paragraph would be observed.
6.16      The agricultural component would, therefore, be largely run by
self-governing cooperatives which, collectively, take all the important
decisions, e.g., regarding choice of crop, allocation of plots, distribution
of water, allocation of work, admission and dismissal of members, etc.



- 39 -
SONADER's function is to oversee and advise on all these activities with a
view to maximizing agricultural efficiency, to provide technical assistance,
both in construction of irrigation works and subsequent farm management and
other farm services, and to extend credit in kind and recover it through the
sale of farmers' rice. This partnership between SONADER and the village
cooperatives has been operating successfully for the last two years in at
least 19 VIS, the only new element being introduced by this project is a
formalized credit system. Although BMDC would open a separate account in its
books for each cooperative, if requested by SONADER and the cooperative, all
loans to the cooperatives would be treated as grants to SONADER which thus
acts as an intermediary between Government and the cooperatives. Ten VIS
would be started each year and developed over three years, thus leading to
completion of full development of the last ten in Year 5. SONADER would like
to move faster, and should be free to do so provided that it would not
jeopardize project success. A detailed month-by-month project implementation
schedule is in Chart III.
6.17      Climatic conditions require that only rice be grown during the
rainy season. The off-season crop would also be rice, even though wheat
or maize could be substituted, without appreciably affecting the rates of
return. The land would be cleared and terraced entirely by farmers themselves
who level it by hand. An average family cannot comfortably handle more than
0.3 ha for seasonal cultivation, and 0.1 ha off-season. This is because VIS
complements, but should not compete with other activities, especially rainfed
farming, flood plain farming, and stock raising. Rice growing in the VIS is
based entirely on the planting of seedlings; there is no direct sowing. Seed
variety used is TTW long-grown in the M'Pourie and Rosso areas and well adapted
to Mauritanian conditions. Although SONADER's initial crop yielded 5 tons of
paddy per hectare without fertilizer, it is proposed to apply chemical fertili-
zer in project VIS, to preserve the potential fertility of the soil at high
level and ensure consistently high yields. At 5 ton/ha, the project would at
full development (3 years for each plot), result in total incremental rice
production of 3,000 tons of paddy a year. No systematic phytosanitary treat-
ment is proposed due to good experience with existing VIS.
6.18      It has been established (para 5.03) that a large unsatisfied demand
exists for rice, and that the total production from this project would satisfy
only a tiny portion of the rice deficit already existing in the project area.
Rice surplus to home consumption requirements would be processed and sold by
SONADER for a charge. The farmer would receive the price paid to SONADER by
SONIMEX, OMC, or any other bulk purchaser of rice, less money owed by the
farmer to SONADER for agreed project services, including medium- and short-term
credit, and rice handling and transportation charges. Detailed costs of this
component are in Annex 1, Table 2; detailed calculations of its internal
financial and economic rates of return are in Annex 11, a typical farm budget
in Annex 12, and further discussion of project benefits and justification
below.

D. Project Cost and Financing
Costs
6.19      The project is expected to cost about US$9.3 million (about US$6.8
million or 73% being foreign) inclusive of about US$0.5 million in taxes and
physical contingencies of US$0.5 million (at 10%, based on our expectations
about estimation errors in Mauritania). Base costs are estimated as of March
31, 1978, with price contingencies added at an average rate of 6.5% per annum
for 1978 and 1979, and 6% in subsequent years, but following normal IDF
practice, no contingencies are included for the industrial line of credit or
its estimated entrepreneurs' counterpart contribution. Project costs, detailed
in Annex 1, Tables 1 to 4, are summarized as follows:

Financing
6.20      The project would be financed by an IDA Credit of US$8.0 million,
which would cover all foreign costs, plus 80% of tax free local costs. The
latter is recommended in view of the Mauritanian Government's difficult public
finance situation caused by drought, political problems in the North and a
depressed iron ore market. Local contributions would, therefore, be limited
to about US$1.3 million equivalent, representing local currency contributions
from the private entrepreneurs (US$.750 million) who would be subborrowers of
BMDC, and a Government contribution of US$0.55 million. Given the identified
needs for preimplementation activities, and the Government's serious financial
constraints, IDA has approved PPF advance totalling US$323,500 (which would be
refinanced out of the proceeds of the Credit) to finance technical assistance
to BMDC and OMAT as well as the brick industry study, and retroactive financ-
ing of US$330,000 is recommended for technical assistance and cost of raw
materials for OMAT, as well as the latter's workshop construction costs.
Financial Intermediation and Onlending Terms
6.21      Funds for the industrial component (US$2.1 million) would be lent
by Government to BMDC at 7% a year. BMDC would onlend these funds to indus-
trial enterprises at 11%. The 4% spread this would leave BMDC is considered
adequate. The remaining IDA Credit funds (about US$5.9 million) would be
passed on as grants to the other implementing institutions. Of this amount,
about US$1.3 million would be onlent by SONADER to farmers (US$1.052 million)
and by OMAT to artisans (US$0.283 million) at 8.5%, in view of the Govern-
ment's strong intention to encourage, through preferential interest rates,
smallholders and artisans who are among the poorest in the population. This
interest rate is also necessary in order to conform to the interest rate
structure applied by the Central Bank throughout Mauritania. There would be
no commitment charges between the Government and BMDC, SONADER, and OMAT,
or between these institutions and final borrowers, except that BMDC would
charge its normal commitment fee to beneficiaries from the industrial line of
credit. For three years, all BMDC industrial subloans intended for IDA
refinancing under the project would be documented to IDA's satisfaction and an
appraisal report thereon submitted to IDA for review and approval prior to IDA
disbursement. All foreign exchange risks would be borne by the Government;
but Government would charge a 1% fee to industrial borrowers only. The rate
of 11% interest plus 1% for foreign exchange risk represents a higher interest
rate than is currently charged to priority sectors on rediscounted loans and
therefore constitutes a major step towards getting the interest rate structure
to reflect the true scarcity of financial resources. This is also more in
line with the inflation rate in the country which has averaged about 11%,
during the last five years and is expected to average, according to the
Government and bank estimates, about 9% during the next three years. The
financing for the industrial zone study would be paid directly to the Ministry
of Industries; that for the brick industry study to the selected consultants
with the approval of SOCOGIM; and the rest to the implementing agencies
indicated in this Chapter. Assurances were obtained at negotiations regarding
titmexAtwa  terms desct hed i  tWis 2ataS, a2x.



- 43 -
E. Project Implementation
Procurement
6.22      The oAly project inputs suitable for international competitive
bidding (ICB) are the irrigation pumps (about US$0.95 million). They would,
therefore, be subject to ICB advertised in foreign embassies in Nauakchott,
and in the "Development Forum". All other project goods and services (US$8.4
million) would be procured following traditional government procedures of
comparative shopping which are satisfactory. Assurances would be sought at
negotiations that these procedures would be followed.
Disbursement
6.23      All disbursement requests would be submitted directly to IDA, but
reimbursed through BMDC acting as overall project accountant. Irrigation
pumps, vehicles, studies and consultants would be fully documented. All other
disbursements would be against appropriate documentation to be retained by the
appropriate institutions and shown to IDA staff during supervision missions.
These procedures have been fully explained to all the project executing
agencies, each of which has an accounting and documentation system good enough
to enable IDA staff to follow up on disbursements and procurements during
supervision missions. The industrial line of credit would be disbursed
against 90% of total costs for high job creation industries and 75% of total
costs for average job creation industries 1/. All other financing would be
disbursed against 100% of total costs except for OMAT non-consultant operating
costs to be disbursed against 50% of total costs.
Monitoring and Evaluation
6.24      The project would be monitored through half-yearly reports by
SONADER, OMAT and BMDC, on their respective IDA financed activities, plus
annual audited accounts of all activities for each of those institutions, to
reach IDA not later than nine months following the end of the accounting
period. In addition, each institution should prepare, immediately after
project implementation, a Project Completion Report, the form and content of
which would be agreed in due course between IDA supervision missions and the
respective project institutions. Assurances were obtained during negotiations
covering provisions of this paragraph.
F. Project Risks
6.25      The main risks facing this project are institutional and sectoral.
Apart from SONADER, none of the project institutions has ever benefitted
directly in the past from Bank Group assistance. Also, apart from agriculture,
1/   See paragraph 6.07 for definitions.



- 44 -
none of the sectors to be assisted has ever received direct Bank Group assist-
ance in the past. There is, therefore, almost a total absence of the kind of
sectoral orientations and policies to facilitate Bank Group intervention.
6.26      The speed of project implementation is, therefore, likely to vary
appreciably from one component to another, depending on the extent to which
desirable sectoral policies and institutional efficiency have already been
attained in the sectors concerned. Thus, the agricultural component is
likely to be implemented the quickest, primarily because of SONADER's
efficiency, and past experience in establishing VIS.
6.27      The artisan component is likely to be the next quickest, again
largely because of the years of experience behind both CFAT and OMA, which
are going to continue their previous activities, but with better organization
under the name of the new State organization, OMAT.
6.28      The industrial component is likely to be the slowest because:
- the natural and man-made obstacles to industrialization discussed
in Chapter III have to be tackled first before investments in this sector can
have much chance of success. The sectoral and administrative reforms being
introduced through this project would remove most of the man-made obstacles,
but they cannot remove the natural handicaps, such as the lack of most
industrial or building raw materials;
- BMDC requires considerable institution building (being provided
through this project) before it can make a noticeable impact on the industrial
scene. It has a very small industrial pipeline, and many of the industries
now on CEPI's list will probably never materialize, and would certainly require
considerable additional study and promotion;
- the declared objective of moving industrialists from techniques
costing US$33,000 per job to those costing US$7,500 to 25,000 is not likely
to be achieved immediately, partly because old habits die hard, partly because
there are real definitional problems, in ensuring equitable selection between,
for example, industrialists who are fortunate enough to be able to rent existing
factory accommodation, and those who are obliged to construct new factories
because none is available for rent. Furthermore, labor-intensive techniques
may be impracticable in the short run despite the best intentions, either
because of the acute shortage of trained labor, or because the only known
production technique for the particular industry is capital intensive. CEPI's
efforts would nevertheless be directed at introducing more labor intensive
techniques. The industrial component is, therefore, the most pioneering and
experimental component, and is designed more with an eye to the improvement of
industrial policies and institutions than to fast disbursement. On the other
hand, risk of actual financial loss would be greatly minimized for the
industrial component by the sub-project review system (para 6.21).
6.29      One should, therefore, not labor under any illusions that this is
going to be an easy project. The project is not being done because it is
easy or free of risk, but rather because it is necessary, and offers enormous
scope for real development. Unless a start is made in tackling some of these
difficult legal, administrative and institutional problems, it will never be
possible to do an easy project in these particular sectors in Mauritania.



- 45 -
6.30      For the project as a whole, the management risk would be considerably
reduced by having each component implemented by a separate institution under
an independent manager. Furthermore, the rate of implementation and success
of each component are independent of what happens to other components.
G. Financial, Economic and Social Evaluation
6.31      The industrial beneficiaries have not been identified with sufficient
accuracy to permit a meaningful assessment of financial or economic returns on
their investments. However, such calculations would be built into both CEPI's
and BMDC's industrial appraisal techniques. Moreover, benefits would be
confirmed during IDA's subproject reviews (para 6.21). The reduction of
average investment costs per job from the current US$33,000 to between US$7,500
and US$25,000 proposed under the project would represent a considerable
improvement in the investment cost of creating industrial jobs.
6.32      The artisan component is likely to increase the income of one of
the most socially and economically disadvantaged groups in the country, i.e.,
illiterate women, many of whom, nevertheless, have to support families. The
incremental investments in OMA  are expecteVd to result in an in crease of
carpet production from 1,500 m to 7,800 m a year, earn a financial rate of
return of 17%, and an economic rate of return of 22% over 20 years (Annex 10).
Weavers would repay all loom and raw material costs with interest; and the
subsidies implicit in the provision to them of rent-free workshops and
technical assistance is justified by their modest income level.
6.33      The agricultural component is particularly urgent in view of the
severe drought of 1977 and acute food shortage in 1978. The project would
increase rice production by about 3,000 tons of paddy a year, while providing
additional income opportunities to 1,800 small-scale farmers--another socially
and economically disadvantaged group. With the exception of the costs of
expatriate and local technical assistance traditionally provided gratis to
farmers, all project costs would be recovered from beneficiaries, but still
leave them with a net income of UM 11,200 for 70 days of work, or UM 160 a
day, which is substantially above the agricultural minimum wage. The compo-
nent would, over 10 years, earn an internal financial rate of return (IER), of
39.5% and an internal economic rate of return (IER) of 31.4% (Annex 11). A
reduction of benefits by as much as 20% would reduce IFR and IER to 30% and
20% respectively.
6.34      In addition to providing about 70 man days of work per year to each
of 1,800 farmers, the project would create approximately 475 new jobs in the
artisan and industrial sectors. The artisan cost per job of US$2,600 is
nearly US$200 below the urban poverty threshold for Mauritania.
6.35      Beyond the above considerations, however, a substantial part of the
project's benefits is not immediately quantifiable, because it consists of
the long-term consequences of the institution-building and sectoral policy and
administrative improvements likely to result from these pioneering efforts in
areas largely untouched by previous Bank Group activities.

1.        In keeping with Bank Group policy and the Government's financial
position, every effort has been made to build into project design as much
cost recovery from ultimate beneficiaries as practicable.
2.        Thus, firstly, no new institution is being created through this
project, all project components being implemented by existing institutions.
Secondly, any proposed expansion in the institutional operating costs is
more than adequately compensated by the projected increases in institutional
productivity. Thirdly, because it is realized that, despite increased produc-
tivity, Government's taxation machinery may be inadequate to ensure that the
increased operating costs are recovered from general taxation, machinery is
built into the project to ensure that, as far as practicable, project costs
are recovered directly from beneficiaries. Specific measures taken in this
regard are discussed below.
Industries - CEPI and IC (Investment Commission)
3.        The costs of CEPI and IC form part of the normal operating costs
of the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Plan respectively. Never-
theless, most of CEPI's costs would, over the next three years, be covered
largely by grants from the Federal Republic of Germany and UNDP. To the
extent that CEPI does any project preparation or feasibility studies, it
would charge the would-be proprietor appropriate consultancy fees. After
the 3-year period of foreign technical assistance, such consultancy fees
would constitute the main source of recovering CEPI's expenses, even though,
for some time thereafter, CEPI's budget may still need to be partly financed
by Government.
BMDC
4.        BMDC's costs of its new Development Department would normally
be recovered by BMDC through its charges to clients for interest on
borrowed capital, appraisal fees, commissions, and commitment charges.
CFAT and OMA
5.        CFAT is an educational institution, and to try to recover its
costs directly from students would violate current education financing
policies. Cost recovery in the education sector would, therefore, need
to be tackled as a separate issue of that sector, not through this project.
Meanwhile, Government would continue to finance CFAT, like all schools, out
of general revenue.
6.        OMA has, for many years, operated as a self-accounting institution
which should make neither profits nor losses in its operations. It should,
therefore, charge its operating expenses to the products it sells for artisans,
11 Early in 1979, CFAF and OMA became respectively the Artisan Training
Department and the Carpet Production Department of the new State organiza-
tion OMAT.

as a management or marketing fee. Such fees would be directly recoverable
from artisans benefitting directly from OMA's services. Similarly, the
cost of looms would be recovered from artisans as medium-term credit,
and the cost of raw materials as seasonal credit, in each case at the
normal interest rate ruling in the country for such operations (currently 8.5%).
Agriculture
7.        Most discussions of irrigation cost recovery assume that irrigation
channels are being constructed, equipment (e.g., sprinklers)and water
supplied, and machinery and farms maintained either by Government, or by
some other institution. The discussion, therefore, generally revolves
around how to recover part or all of these capital and operating costs
from the beneficiaries, often through water charges.
8.         This project is completely different from the stereotype described
above. Here, the farmers are going to dig the irrigation channels themselves.
They are also going to buy, on long-term credit, the pumps and all ancillary
equipment necessary to lift the water from the river and distribute it. They
will also buy (on seasonal credit), seed, fertilizer, fuel and lubricants, spares,
and mechanic's services. The only costs not recoverable from farmers are costs
of initial expatriate and local technical assistance (about 50% of the agricultural
component cost) scheduled to last for only three years. The subsequent direct
operating costs and salaries of SONADER staff in the VIS would be recovered from
farmers. All credit would be at the interest rate ruling in the country for such
operations (currently 8.5%). These arrangements represent a far greater degree
of cost recovery than now exists in the country.

5 - Commercial loans
It is assumed that in view of restrictive credit policies of BCM and the
difficulties encountered by BMDC to mobilize deposits, the high rate at which
the commercial credits of BMIDC grew in the past will decrease substantially. The
commercial pQrtfolio will thus only increase at the rate of 10 % per annum over
the next five years as follows :
1977     1978      1979      1980      1981      1982
COMMERCTAL CREDITS       659.1(2)  725.0    797.5    877.3    965.0   1 061.5

(2) excludes UM 33.7 million crdit to M.I.E.
Sundry debtors & other misc. liabilities are expected to remain at their
level in 1977.
6 - Revenues
Interest received on term credits is assumed to remain at 6 % on loans appro-
ved prior to 1979 and 11 % on loans approved thereafter. No revenus are expected
from the equity portfolio. Interest & commissions received on commercial portfolio
are expected to grow proportionately with the growth of the commercial portfolio
(+ 10 % per annum).
7 - Resources
- Deposits are expected grow only at the rate of 10 %.
- Other short term liabilites are expected to remain at their level in 1977.
- No further borrowings are expected from CCCE.
- Borrowings from BCM are expected to slow down considerably and are assumed
to grow only at the rate of 5 % per annum over the next five years.
- Borrowing from IDA is expected to start in 1979 and is exclusively earmarked
for financing of indusual projects.
- Unidentified borrowings of UM 110 million will be sought in 1982.
_ ____________
I) Includes UM 33.7 million credit to M.I.E. which appears in short term portfolio in
the balance sheet as of December 31, 1977.



-62-
ANNEX 7
8 - Financial charges
Sight deposits are to cost an average of 1,5 % as in the past. Term deposits
are remunerated at the rate of 6,5 %. Financial charges on BCM borrowings are cal-
culated at the rate of 5,1 % and on CCCE borrowings at the actual cost, which ave-
rages out at slightly more than 3 %. IDA borrowings are assumed to cost 7,5 %.
9 - Capital
To maintain a reasonable debt equity ratio, the capital of BMDC should increase
by at least 50 % by cash subscription in 1982.
10 - Administrative expenses
Administrative expenses including personnel are expected to grow by
and 10 % thereafter, reflecting increased staff, technical assistance
and trainning expenses.
11 - Provisions
Specific provisions for bad and doubtful debts are increased each year to remain
at 3 % of the outstanding commercial & term portfolio. General provisions are built-up
and maintained at the level of approximately 4 % of the outstanding portfolio.
12 - Fixed assets
Except for investments of UM 2 million annually in new equipement and furniture,
fixed assets are not expected to grow during the period. Depreciation is carried out
at the present rate.
13 - Dividends
Dividends are expected to be paid out at the rate of 10 % as from 1981.
14 - Taxes
Taxes are calculated at the rate of 40 %.

1/ In the absence of estimated opening and closing stock figures, it is not
possible to prepare proper income and expenditure accounts for these years.
2/ Although the "surpluses" are not true profits (see Note 1 above), their
existence and amounts cast some doubt on the need for the Government
subsidies. Under the Project, efforts would be made to get OMA to recover
all its operating costs from beneficiaries.
