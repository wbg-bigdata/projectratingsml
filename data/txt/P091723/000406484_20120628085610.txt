1      BACKGROUND

The Agency of State Roads-Skopje carried out the project for reconstruction and upgrade of the
road section Tabanovce-Kumanovo which is part of Corridor X to the level of highway, in a total
length of 7.62 km.
In order to establish the impact on the environment and health of the population from the
implementation of the project, EIA Study has been prepared by the Consulting Company „RI
OPUS? Skopje, in which the possible impacts on the environment and health have been
identified, and measures for their mitigation or elimination have been taken into consideration.
Also, in the EIA Study the aspects from the noise have been developed.

For overcoming of the identified impacts of noise, in the EIA Study as a measure it is envisaged
erection of protective walls (concrete or metal made) at locations passing through populated
places, Dolno Konjare and part of Tabanovce.

Taking into account possible impacts to the environment and human health, originating from
increased level of noise caused by the traffic, due to the vicinity of the existing residential zones
(with permanent and occasional residence), on part of the route in Tabanovce and Dolno
Konjare, the Investor prepared Main Design1 for protection against noise on Tabanovce-
Kumanovo road section of E752.
The document had a task to identify the level of noise, generated by the increased traffic
(prospection-2031year), and propose mitigation measures. On the basis of detailed analysis
and calculations, construction of protection barriers has been proposed. The lack of elaboration
of other alternatives/options for noise reduction in the Noise Study, involves consideration of
additional alternative measures for noise reduction in parts of the route, where sensitive
receptors are considered to be, in regard to affected population.
In that regard the Agency of State Roads, as orderer of the service, requested the Consultant
Menka Spirovska, authorized environmental impact assessment expert, to prepare Annex to
EIA Study, to include appropriate alternative measures for noise reduction during the
operational phase of the Project and carry out the procedure of consultation with the affected
population whose housing buildings are located in adjacent proximity of the road section.
The Terms of Reference (TORs) define the activities to be covered in this Annex, as follows:
         Analysis of alternatives, including initially proposed solutions for construction of barriers
          and different possibilities for such barriers designing, confirmation of approved solution
          both from noise reduction and economic points of view;
         Detailed consideration of identified alternative measures for noise reduction related to
          the road operation. This should involve detailed analysis of the results from the proposed
          mitigation measures with indication of the basis leading to such conclusions;

      Description of the legal framework as grounds for the resulting proposed solution for
       noise reduction;
      Review of the Environmental Impact Assessment Study/Environmental Management
       Plan to include this alternative approach; the Annex should thus include: (i) details,
       proposed mitigation measures and expected results with reference to noise levels inside
       and around houses (explanation of these assessments), (ii) analysis of alternatives that
       will show the reason for which the proposed alternative has been selected, (iii) legal
       basis for the proposed alternative.


The goal of identifying additional alternative measures for mitigation of noise impacts caused by
the traffic is to determine the most appropriate solution that will ensure full protection against
increased level of noise on affected population and also acceptable from economic and
sustainable point of view for the Investor.
It is of particular importance to note that in the period of implementation of this assignment, the
project has been completed, i.e. the main road Tabanovce-Kumanovo has been reconstructed
and upgraded. The traffic is carried out continuously on two roadways, and analyzed
alternatives are related to the operational phase of the Project.

2        SUMMARY OF THE FINDINGS OF THE NOISE STUDY
The Main Design for Protection against noise (Noise Study) is based on the national and
European regulations on noise, the measurements on ten measuring points along the route in
Tabanovce and Dolno Konjare, current and projected trafic frequency in the period from 2010 to
2031 and predicted noise levels due to the trafic.

         2.1 Measured noise levels at most sensitive receptors
During the preparation of the Noise Study for reconstruction and upgrading of the road section
Tabanovce-Kumanovo, several measurements were conducted of the generated noise by the
existing traffic.

The measurement points are located at two parts of the road, near the village of Dolno Konjare
(4 measuring points) and the village Tabanovce (6 measuring points). Based on conducted
measurements, it was concluded that noise levels exceed the limit values at certain locations.
The table below shows detailed description of measuring points and measured noise levels.

  9     Distance from the right lane where the traffic takes place is 39   49.3              62.1
        m from the end asphalt edge, 8 m from auxiliary structure and
        21 m from individual ground floor and floor house.
        This measuring point is positioned around 3 m lower relative
        to the level of the roadway.
  10    This measuring point is positioned between the highway and         70.1              53.3
        a local road at 42 m from the right lane where the traffic takes
        place and 4 m from the local road behind which, at 23 m,
        there is a commercial building of ground floor and floor.
        For this point, it may be concluded that the noise from the
        local road is predominant relative to the noise from the
        highway.

The data in the above Table are only evidence of generated noise levels which are not taken
into consideration in the later stage of calculations of the forecasted noise levels related to
predicted traffic. Estimation of the noise levels, generated by the traffic have been done on the
base of: (a) competent traffic load; (b) characteristics of the traffic flows; (c) spatial conditions on
the current section of the road and (d) characteristics of the transverse and (e) longitudinal
sections of the road, all related to the buildings on the both side of the road.
On the base of those calculations, the following figures for the expected noise levels have been
produced:

mitigation measures for the expected noise are proposed-construction of the noise barriers
without assessment of other alternatives.

The Noise study (Main design for protection against noise) determines the positions at which it
is considered that the mitigation measure has to be applied:
   -   at km 1 + 260 to km 1 + 304, left of the highway where 2 buildings are located;
   -   at km 1 + 310 to km 1 + 315, right of the highway where 1 building is located;
   -   at km 1 + 940 to km 1 + 987, left of the highway where 4 buildings are located;
   -   at km 2 + 060 to km 2 + 340, left of the highway where group of buildings is located;
   -   at km 2 + 330 to km 2 + 350, right of the highway where 1 building is located;

The day in terms of this Decision covers the period from 07.00 to 19.00 hours, evening covers
the period from 19.00 to 23.00 hours, and night covers the period from 23.00 to 07.00 hours.
According to Article 3 of the Rulebook on the locations of measuring stations and measuring
points (Official Gazette of RM no. 120/08), the areas for protection against noise depending on
the type of activity and sensitivity of the population staying therein are divided into four extents:
    -   Area with first (I) degree of noise protection is the area intended for tourism and
        leisure activities, area near hospital institutions and area of national parks and natural
        reserves.
    -   Area with second (II) degree of noise protection is the area intended primarily for
        stay, i.e. residential area, areas near educational facilities, facilities for social welfare and
        accommodation of children and elderly, and facilities for primary health care,
        playgrounds and public parks, grean areas, recreation areas and local parks.
    -   Area with third (III) degree of noise protection is the area where interventions in the
        surrounding are permitted where the noise will be less disturbing, , i.e. trade – business
        – residential areas, which are intended both for living and working, (mixed area), areas
        for agricultural activities and public centres where administrative, trade, service and
        catering activities are performed.
    -   Area with fourth (IV) degree of noise protection is the area where interventions in
        environment causing noise disturbance are permitted: areas that have no residential

         buildings, intended for industrial and craftsman activities, production activities, transport
         activities, storage and servicing, communal activites that produce stronger noise.

Structures positioned close to the highway belong to the group of areas with third extent of
protection against noise. According to Article 3 of the Rulebook on the locations of measuring
stations and measuring points (Official Gazette of RM no. 147/08), the limit values of core
environmental noise indicators for noise caused by different sources, for area with third extent of
protection, shall not be higher than:
Lday – 60 dB(A)                       Levening – 60 dB(A)              Lnight – 55 dB(A)

According to Article 6 of the Rulebook on environmental noise level limit values, in areas outside
urbanized locations, the limit values for areas exposed at intensive road transport are as
follows:
Lday – 60 dB(A)                       Levening – 55 dB(A)              Lnight – 50 dB(A)

The areas along Tabanovce-Kumanovo highway are mostly rural; however, along the route near
Dolno Konjare and Tabanovce, there is a group of housing buildings, as well as individual
buildings intended for permanent and temporary residence.
According to Article 4 of Rulebook on environmental noise level limit values, the limit values
of the basic values of noise indicators inside the premises where people reside,
especially vulnerable population groups are placed, and for health protection from
adverse effects, is shown in Table 4.

        REDUCTION (MAIN DESIGN FOR PROTECTION AGAINS NOISE) AND EXPLANATION
        OF THE NEED FOR ALTERNATIVE SOLUTION

        4.1 Originally proposed mitigation measures for noise reduction
Sound barriers of different heights have been proposed for the analyzed part of the road section
(Chapter 2), as shown on the table below. The height of the barriers has been determined in line
with the conditions of the transversal cross-section and height of the recipient, so that the
highest point of the window on the floor falls in the shadow of the proposed barrier.

Comment: The wall required for the buildings on station from 1+940 to 1+987 as overlapping
with the wall required for the buildings on station 2 + 060 to 2 + 340 as well as wall of the
buildings on stations 2 +367 and 2 + 720, should be continuous. Therefore, the length of the
wall will be 912 m.
Based on calculations obtained for noise levels on road sections where limit values of core
noise indicators have been exceeded, barriers for protection against noise have been proposed
to be of absorbing material (aluminum) in the lower zone, with a height of 0.5 and 1 m, and
reflective transparent barriers (polycarbonate) in the upper zone.
The developer of the Main design carried out calculations for noise attenuation by each barrier.
The values of attenuation and the expected decreasing of noise levels are shown in Table 7.

        4.2 Analysis of proposals contained in the Main design for
            protection against noise (Noise Study)
The Main design for protection against noise (Noise study) is focused on construction of sound
barriers towards the most exposed residential buildings at the highway section, which is subject
of the project. Calculations of expected noise levels were made for selected recipients and the
need for protection measures application was defined.

The approach of the Main design is logical and professional, though certain corrections and
supplements are needed:
       1. The highway already exists in the space and there is increased noise level. The Main
          design does not show the extent of noise contribution generated by the reconstructed
          highway compared to the status before its reconstruction;
       2. It does not take into account that, upon highway reconstruction, transport will be carried
          out mainly on two lanes mutually separated by a distance of around 20.5 m, and the
          increased of noise level at receptor points on the left side will be smaller;
       3. No other alternative solutions for noise mitigation have been considered (the Study does
          not analyze alternative materials for the barriers, nor alternative solutions for noise
          decreasing).

                                                                                                                15

             TO ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT STUDY OF THE HIGHWAY TABANOVCE-KUMANOVO


In order to overcome this incompliance, the Consultant made new calculations of noise levels,
so that the road is divided into two parallel segments (Figure 1). Frequency of traffic at individual
segments was determined under the assumption that it was equal in both directions. It was
assumed that the values of the average elevation differences of recipients relative to the line of
the source were calculated correctly in the Main design, because the latter does not include the
elements4 of the calculations.

The values of noise obtained by such conceptualized calculation are lower5 than those in the
Main design and the difference depends on the distance of the given recipient from the source,
as well as on the average height h (m) According to this the noise levels with implementation of
sound barriers presented in Table 10 are lower compared with the noise level values given in

It is very important to highlight that for the recipients on the left side of the road the difference of
noise levels is smaller compared to those for on the right side. The reason for such a difference
is the fact that half of the traffic on the highway will take place 20.5 m closer to the right-side
receptors.
Undoubtedly, the up-grading of the road to a level of highway will lead to a significant increase
of the noise level. Differences as high as 10 dB (A) are expected at most of the receptors taken
into consideration in the Main design.
According to the assessment made by both the Main design for protection against noise and the
Consultant –author of this Annex, measures for noise abatement are required for all the position
listed above.

    4.3 Analysis of the applicability of the solution proposed by the
        Main design
The EIA expert, engaged for preparation of this Annex, undertook: (a) several site visits (b)
check-measurements of noise levels on the most affected sites (c) analyzed all available
documentation, related to the analyzed road section and (d) studied several international good
practice for introducing mitigation measures for decreasing the noise levels, generated by high
way traffic.
On the base of that, we are presenting the current situation and applicability of the proposed
alternative for sound barriers on which base in the further chapters of this Annex we will analyze
alternative solutions.
    On station: km 1+210 to km 1+375 left of the roadway, where structures are partially
     hidden behind a mount, around 3 m high, it is proposed to erect a barrier of 3 m in
     height. The barrier is not appropriate for the terrain configuration, because that segment
     already has tall natural barrier and application of alternative measure should be
     considered towards additional noise reduction.

The predicted length of the barrier is 165 m with a height of 3 m and its cost is estimated at
13.482.706.75 denars or 219.231.00 €.
This barrier will cover two buildings, only one of which is inhabited, which means that the price
of the protection against increased level of noise would amount as much as 219.231,00 € per
building.

 The barrier on the station km 1+280 to km 1+370 on the right side of the roadway is of
  90 m in length and 2 m in height, covering only one building which is inhabited
  occasionally, while its cost is 4.441.143.00 denars or 72.213.71 €.

  the station km 2+360 to km 2+783 is of length of 424 m and height of 5 m and its cost is
  estimated at 70.811.708.15 denars or 1.151.409.89 €. These two barriers cover a group
  of structures and so the price calculated for protection against noise per individual
  structure would range from 50.000 to 80.000 €. It should be underlined that structures

   are located in the immediate proximity to the highway (around 13 m). The highway itself
   is elevated above the level of the houses, and thus additional barrier with a height of 4-5
   m would cause the effect of enclosure, which could affect the psychological perception
   of inhabitants to a greater extent than the received noise to which the inhabitants have
   been adapted considering the fact that they have lived for long by this road section.

CONCLUSION:

     Erection of sound barriers on the proposed route, considered from environmental point
      of view, is very efficient solution of environmental noise levels reduction.
     Presented calculations confirm that the level of noise in the affected area will be
      decreased by installation of sound barriers, thus being compliant with the legal
      framework (noise reducing up to 20 dB (A).
     On some position the terrain configuration is not suitable for setting barriers (position km
      1+210 to km 1+375, there is a natural barrier).
     On      some      positions,    where     are located     buildings      away from about
      13 meters (km 2 +290 to km 2 +389) the road, setting barrier is not suitable solution, due
      to the narrow space. On those positions, placing barriers can cause feelings of
      isolation and rejection by the residents.
     Analyzed      from       the financial point  of     view     the      sound barriers
      are unsustainable solution (quite an expensive investment), especially the positions
      which are located along one or two objects (km 1+210 to km 1+375, km 1+280 to km
      1+370, km 2+290 to km 2+389).

     Nevertheless, installation of the sound barriers is accompanied by certain negative
      effects as well, such as: (a) disruption of visual characteristics, especially on stations
      where barriers of 5 meters in height have been proposed; (b) formation of shade towards
      housing buildings and feeling of being enclosed6; (c) hindering of natural air circulation.

  This regards especially cases where structures are positioned at lower elevation from the highway, and the highway itself is a
visual barrier to them. In such cases, placement of additional barrier will create additional problem.

                                                                                                                             21

         TO ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT STUDY OF THE HIGHWAY TABANOVCE-KUMANOVO


On the basis of the above presented observations, it may be concluded that the barriers,
proposed in the Noise Study, are rather efficient in terms of reduction of ambient noise levels,
nevertheless, observed from financial point of view, they represent unsustainable solution. Apart
from the huge financial investment required for sound barriers construction, additional
investments will be required in future for their maintenance (especially for polycarbonate
barriers).
In order to be achieved protection from noise, caused by traffic on the highway against the local
population further in this Annex will be considered alternative measures to reduce noise that
may be applicable from technical and financial aspects, and also will also be eligible for the local
population.

5   ALTERNATIVE MEASURES FOR NOISE REDUCTION

There is series of ways for reduction of noise from the traffic. Generally, these are divided into
three categories:

    1. reduction of noise at its source;
    2. construction of sound barriers;
    3. sound insulation of recipients (treatment of residential buildings).

In certain cases, noise reduction is impossible or faces difficulties in such processes, which are
difficult to overcome, and concern:
     shortage of space for the measure implementation;

     disruption of aesthetic appearance;
     opposition to the measure by the population; and
     financial costs.

    5.1 Reduction of noise at source
Reduction of traffic noise at source includes measures planned and implemented during
highway designing and construction, as well as measures defined and implemented during
exploitation. These measures include:
       Vertical and horizontal alignment of the road;
       Covering with the so called „quiet asphalt?;

       Transport management.
Adequate road alignment and selection of appropriate materials during construction to acquire
the so called „quiet asphalt? are one of the basic measures for noise reduction at source.
Asphalt with rubber admixtures has demonstrated particularly good results.
A noise level reduction of 3-8 dB(A)) , (50-80%) compared to „normal“asphalt can be achieved
by applying rubber asphalt.

Traffic control reduces the problems caused by traffic noise to a certain extent. Reduction of
driving speed contributes to noise level reduction (reduction of speed limit on the highway by 20
km/h can contribute to notable noise level reduction from 2 to 3 dB (A)). Following measure will
support the implementation of speed regime and thus provide the assessed noise reduction:
       Adjustment of road signalization to achieve constant speed and reduce the necessities
        for breaking or acceleration.

   5.1.1    Analyse of alternative

In this case, analyze of the possibilities which could be applied in the phases of designing or
construction, is not possible, because of the fact that these phases have already been
completed and the highway is in its exploitation phase. At this moment, it could be
recommended that in future, in case of possible reconstruction of the road section, the
alternative for selection of appropriate construction materials is taken into consideration in order
to obtain „quiet asphalt? which will certainly contribute to noise reduction (3-8 dB (A)).
The following measures for noise reduction can be considered in the phase of the highway
exploitation:
    Reduction of vehicles driving speed-driving speed has significant impact on noise level.
     In the period of 2009 year, vehicles driving speed was restricted at 60 km/h, except on
     the road section before Tabanovce (around 5 kilometers to Tabanovce), where
     restriction was at 90 km/h. The level of noise covering the period of the day and three
     hours of the evening period expressed as Leq(A) was within the range of 48.18 to 62.13
     dB(A). Upon slight increase of the intensity and average speed of passenger cars of 100
     km/h, and freight vehicles of 70km/h, the level of noise for 2011 ranges between 57.08
     and 66.07 dB(A) for the same intervals and recipients. To reduce the noise level, it is
     recommended to reduce the vehicle driving speed by 20-30 km/h;
    Setting of adequate road signalization to inform drivers of speed limit in time and thus
     sudden breakings and accelerations contributing to noise level increase will be avoided.

This alternative measures will contribute to reduce the noise level by 2-3 dB(A). This is a
noticeable reduction of noise.

    5.2 Sound barriers
The Main design for protection against noise is focused on construction of polycarbonate sound
barrier towards the most exposed residential buildings. Except polycarbonate barrier no other
alternative materials or solution as sound barriers are taken into consideration.
As was mentioned in the chapter 4.3 polycarbonate sound barriers are rather efficient in terms
of reduction of ambient noise levels (noise attenuation up to 8,8-19,10 dB(A), but observed from
financial point of view (3.335.008,62 €) they represent very expensive solution.
Due to the absent of elaboration of alternative materials (in the Noise Study) and high costs for
implementation of polycarbonate barriers, the consultant analyzed the alternative materials for
sound barrier, noise level reduction by its usage and financial viability, presented as follows.
Barriers can have a shape of:

   1. Earth embankments along the road–earth bermes;
   2. Tall, vertical barriers;


                                                                                                 24
                                            ANNEX
         TO ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT STUDY OF THE HIGHWAY TABANOVCE-KUMANOVO


   3. Combination of earth embankments and barriers; and
   4. Formation of vegetation.

Earth embankments do not have great impact on visual effects, but they require huge volumes
of earth due to their great dimensions and height.
Installation of vertical barriers requires less space, but there are limiting factors for height, due
to certain technical and aesthetic requirements.
Vertical barriers may be manufactured of the following materials: wood, concrete, metal, plastic,
recycled material etc. Design and materials used for sound barriers are based on the following
factors such as aging, resistance to corrosion, resistance to strikes by stones, resistance of
paint, fire resistance, etc.
The maximum value that may be achieved theoretically is 20 dB (A) for thin walls and 23 dB (A)
for berme.
    Earth bermes and supporting structures
If road construction activities generated larger amounts of inert waste material, earth bermes
can be used as noise barriers. It will reach benefits in two aspects: (a) reduction of the noise
levels and (b) reduction of the inert waste, which can be disposed around the road. Bermes
design should be compatible with the surrounding landscape and terrain topography. This kind
of barriers can be visually attractive, acoustically effective, but occupy major portion of land.
    Concrete
Concrete is used in different ways for sound barriers construction. Concrete sound barriers are
simple for maintenance, but prefabricated sound barriers are relatively expensive. As
alternative, profiles of concrete may be used to form the lower part of the sound barriers
(combination of concrete-plastics, concrete-aluminum).

    Metal
Aluminum is very often used for commercial purposes because of the firmness and weight,
large panels can be easily lifted up to 5 meters.
    Transparent materials
Transparent materials enable the light to reach the houses adjacent to barriers. Transparency of
the top of the barrier will reduce visual effect of high barriers. Establishment of transparent
barriers facilitates drivers to orient by observing the surrounding area.
Potential problems that could be caused on birds may be avoided by use of acrylic material or a
scheme of thin non-transparent strips. Transparent material causes noise reflection and their
use can be limited where reflection could cause problem. Transparent panels should be
protected against strikes by vehicles.



                                                                                                  25

           TO ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT STUDY OF THE HIGHWAY TABANOVCE-KUMANOVO

    Plastics
Besides its use in transparent panels, plastics may be also used in adsorption panels and as
supplementary materials for plantations. Plastic is prone to damages from fire and upon long
exposition to solar light it becomes fragile.
    Recycled material

Numerous recyclable materials are acceptable for production of noise barriers, such as: plastics
in auxiliary structures, waste material from industrial processes, used tires as
flowerpots/jardinières, household waste converted into compost. Recyclable materials could
also have certain constraints in terms of suitability and sustainability.
    Vegetation
Vegetation has to be sufficiently high, wide and dense, to reduce noise generated by traffic.
Vegetation of sufficient density in a belt of 60 m in width is able to reduce the noise level by 10
dB (A). However, it is almost impossible in practice to plant and grow such vegetation belt along
roads in order to achieve the said reductions. Given the fact that no significant noise level
reduction can be achieved before vegetation reaches certain age, there is a view that plantation
of these green belts is not significant and popular measure for noise reduction. Planting of trees
and shrubs provide psychological benefits through visual coverage, provision of privacy or as
aesthetic measure, but not as a measure for traffic noise reduction on highways.

   5.2.1    Analyse of alternative
The implementation of sound barriers made by different materials analyzed above, led to
conclusion that with the implementation of thus, the noise level will be reduced approximately 20
db (A). It means that the limit values, stipulated in the regulatory framework will be achieved.
However, the barriers will change the landscape, disrupt visual characteristics on the terrain
(especially on the positions where barriers of 4-5 meters in height have been proposed), format
shades towards housing buildings and rise feeling of being enclosed. It doesn’t matter what kind
of material will be used, the effects will be the same as are described.
Besides advantages and disadvantages of sound barriers mentioned above, analyzed in the
financial point of view, we can conclude that polycarbonate barriers preferred in the Main design
is very expensive solution.
As a result of previously stated, the Consultant has been analyzed construction of sound
barriers on identified stations with using alternative material, e.g. installation reinforced concrete
barriers, as well as barriers of reinforced concrete mounting elements. These analyses are
made only for financial costs comparison between solution given in the Main design and
analyzed alternative materials. The financial costs of the analyzed sound barriers are presented
in the following table:

              design (Noise Study)

The financial analyzes shows that construction of barriers is very expensive solution. The
preferred materials in the Noise Study, is the most expensive one. For all mention above, it can
be concluded that installation of sound barrier cannot be the unique solution which has to be
preferred as a mitigation measures for noise reduction.
Formation of vegetation, as mentioned in the previous chapter, as an alternative measure is not
very practical in the context of reduction of the noise along the highway and also requires a long
period of time to reach height able to contribute to noise level reduction.

           5.3 Sound insulation                     of    recipients     (treatment           of     housing
               buildings)
In case where the construction of sound barriers is not justified, from esthetic, psychological or
financial point or it is hardly feasible because of the proximity of housing buildings, the goal of
noise reduction is to mitigate it in housing buildings and not in the environment, other
alternatives for noise reduction should be considered. In such cases, we should consider the
possibility for application of measures for housing buildings treatment (i.e. their sound
insulation-soundproof windows and doors).

Installation of proper type of windows provides an acoustic improvement in the residential
facilities. The level of noise reduction depends on: a) the frame design, b) glazing, c)
composition of glass pane type, d) distance between glass panes and e) seals.

The noise transfer through and around windows can be reduced by using thicker glazing,
double glazed system and high quality window perimeter seals7.
The ability of windows to reduce the noise level is given in the following table:

Table 12 Noise reduction by windows
      Type of structure                      Windows                       Reduction of outside noise

    The larger glazed area means the greater sound transmission through the window

                                                                                                                 27

There are several different materials commonly used for window frames (timber, aluminum,
PVC etc.), however, the type of material does not usually have a significant influence on noise
reduction properties, due to its small surface. The effect of perimeter window seals are the
critical issue in window frames.
PVC windows have a very good cost-benefit ratio. PVC windows offer clear-cut cost
advantages, both in procurement and throughout the entire life cycle. Timber frames are
approximately 20-30 % more expensive than PVC profiles, and aluminum windows cost 30 %
more again representing the most expensive alternative. Based on the high energy-saving
potential and minimal maintenance throughout the entire service life of more than 50 years,
costs are also saved in the long-term.
In the following table are given approximately prices of the windows and doors produced from
different material, PVC, aluminum and timber.

There are a number of glazing options available: single, double, triple, and secondary glazing.
Secondary glazing, involves the installation of an additional internal glazed window. It offers
much improved sound insulation, thermal insulation and enhanced window security
performance.
This new, fully independent secondary window frame goes on the inside or room side of the
existing or primary window. Fitting secondary double glazing will not therefore impact on the
external appearance of the building.
Where space permits, it may be cheaper and less disturbing to owners to install second,
„separate window“ in the same frame opening.
The noise reduction depends on the thickness of the glass. This is shown in the following table:




                                                                                                  28

             (4/16/4) thermo pane with triple glazing                               32-36

In the practice the most suitable glasses for noise reduction is thermo pane with double and
triple glazing.

The window frame material can provide additional decreasing of noise level (up to 42 dB or
much more). The soundproof systems besides noise reduction provide thermal isolation as well.
The frame occupies a small surface in terms of the glass, but the both together contribute for
significant noise protection.
Specific treatment of windows and doors involves the need for alternative ventilation (air
conditioning) provision so that windows are closed during noisy periods of the day. The
application of this alternative requires installation of ventilation system in buildings.
These types of measures for noise reduction do not provide benefits in terms of reduction of
outside (ambient) noise, but in terms of internal noise reduction they can achieve the highest
effects compared to all existing solutions for noise reduction (20-40 dB (?)).
 Additional expected benefits, with implementation of this measure/alternative are: (a) reaching
saving of energy in the improved facilities; (b) avoiding shade effects and (c) avoiding the
feeling of enclosures and (d) avoiding significant visual changes.

    5.3.1    Analyse of alternative

This alternative involves replacement of windows and doors on buildings exposed at the highest
noise level, i.e. buildings positioned immediately next to the road.
Taking into account the efficiency of noise decreasing (20-40 dB (A), additional benefits in
energy saving, landscaping, psychological effects and financial costs, this alternative is the most
suitable one. The PVC windows and doors system and thermo pane glasses will reduce the
noise level approximately of 36 dB (A).

 A "thermo pane" is a construction of double or more glasses, separated by a trapped air space and
hermetically closed. The trapped air acts as an insulator, reducing noise level and heat loss through the
glass

                                                                                                            29

Considered from financial point of view, this alternative is by far more cost-effective compared to
alternative for sound barriers construction (it seems to be about 16 times cheaper solution).

6   CONSULTATION WITH THE AFFECTED POPULATION, CONCLUSIONS AND
    PROPOSAL OF THE MOST APPROPRIATE SOLUTION

    6.1 Consultation with the affected population
In the process of implementation of the assignment, the Consultant carried out field
investigations and additional measurements of noise levels in the environment and interior of
the most exposed buildings, as well as assessment of interventions required to protect the
buildings (in the village Dolno Konjare and village Tabanovce).
During these visits, contacts were established with certain number of inhabitants–owners of
exposed buildings, random passersby and curious people. In the following text we present
summary overview of the most frequently given answers by the citizens to specific questions
related to noise resulting from the traffic.
       To the question whether the highway generates noise that disturbs them during the
        performance of their everyday activities in the yard or inside the house, all consultant
        inhabitants had similar answers:
             No,
             We have got used to noise – there was a road here earlier as well,
             Noise is not a problem, but there are other problems related to safety wire made
              fence and properties expropriation, etc.
       To the question, would you like to have sound barriers constructed to obtain better
        protection against noise, the most frequent answers were the following:
            No, no way, because they will additionally obstruct our view;
            No, because we will feel like in prison;
            No, we are not happy with wire fence, not to mention some walls.
       Do you feel threatened by the traffic carried out on the highway while you are in the
        house yard or inside the house (in terms of incidents occurrence):
            Almost all answers were identical, in a sense that they did not feel threatened or
             did not think of that.

In the course of the field visit to the route, within informal consultations with the local population,
it was mentioned that sound barriers are not very much desired solution for overcoming the
problem of noise, because the barriers will provoke other problems, such as: shadows effects;
negative visual effects and feelings of enclosure. In addition to this, they do not feel the noise as
a problem that needs to be settled, because they have lived by the road for long and it has
become part of their everyday lifestyle.
Finally, we would note that during the assessment of the buildings, where according to the

provided, the residents did not allow access to buildings under the explanation that there was no
need for any intervention and they had not have a problem with noise.

    6.2 Findings
On the basis of the presented analysis we recognized:
      In the moment of implementation of this assignment, the analyzed route from the
       highway is reconstructed and it is already in use;
      The increased noise level along the highway is evidenced for years and the local citizens
       which are living near the road are most affected by the noise;
      The local citizens haven’t got a feeling that they are affected by the road;
      During the designing process, the developer couldn’t introduce the basic standards for
       designing of the highway, respecting the distance from the inhabited area due to the
       already existed road;
      Most of the cars and tracks which transit on the road are old and generate increased
       levels of noise;
      Permissible speed driving on the reconstructed road section is 130 km/h;
      The vicinity of the residential buildings to the road and the terrain condition, does not
       give many opportunities for implementing various solutions for reduction of
       environmental noise level which will be in compliance with the limit values (regulated in
       the National legal frame);
      Implementation of the alternative which promotes installation of barriers will be
       appropriate solution for the side of the road on which those will be installed, but not in
       the whole affected environment (both side of the road);
      Most of the interviewed people have presented the view of rejecting the barriers as a
       solution, describing that they will have negative feelings with it;
      At some parts of the road, the space between the road and the residential zones is so
       narrow, so the installation of the barriers is not save and possible;
      There are not recognized other sensitive receptors around the investigated route of the
       road. It means that the mitigation measures have to be applied only to the residential
       buildings (local population) in the village Dolno Konjare and village Tabanovce, as the
       most affected;
      According to the estimates made in the Main design for noise protection and Consultant-
       author of this Annex, it can be concluded that mitigation measures for decreasing of
       noise levels on all previous mentioned positions are required.

    6.3 Proposal of the most appropriate solution
Due to the necessity to protect the most sensitive receptors-citizens, the most appropriate and
sustainable solution is the application of the alternative measure-treatment of housing
buildings. This will be acceptable for the local population, as well.



                                                                                              32

This alternative includes replacement of the existing windows and doors of the buildings,
located in the first row, nearest to the road. It is estimated that about 70 residential facilities are
the most affected by the increased noise level.
Due to the need to be successfully reached decreasing of the generated noise levels of about
36 dB it is recommended the following characteristics of the materials for successful
implementation of the measure:.
        PVC windows and doors system with frame with 72 mm system, 5 chambers and 24 mm
         (4/16/4)* thermo pane with double glazing;
        proper air gap between the pane and
        usage of the additional construction material (gases for noise reduction-argon, krypton,
         etc.)

*The thermo pane glasses with dimensions 24 mm (4/16/4) with double glazing is the most
applicable solution as a result of the weight of the glass. It must be taken into consideration that
most of the existing buildings are old and the bigger weight of the glass and window systems
may provoke damages of the facades/stability of the building.
Fitting secondary double glazing is recommended application, as well. It will not have an impact
on the external appearance of the building. It is considered that this solution is cheaper than
completely removal of the existing windows and doors.
Taking into consideration that in the most frequent periods of the day, the windows should be
closed, it is recommended installation of air-conditioners.

On the basis of the number of buildings located along the main road, initial first rough
calculations have been made to indicate that replacement of windows and doors, as well as
installation of air-conditioners, will require approximately 12.300.000 denars or 200.000 €.

Considered from financial point of view, this alternative is by far more cost-effective and efficient
compared to alternative for sound barriers construction.
The implementation of this alternative will achieve:
     Lower level of noise in homes and the highest effects compared to all analyzed
      solutions;
     Avoiding effect of shade, feeling of enclosures and negative visual effect,
With implementation of this alternative it is expected to be reached the limit values defined in
the Rulebook on environmental noise level limit values.

Although the mentioned effects will be achieved, the environmental noise will remain
unchanged. The increase of vehicle frequency on the highway in future will also increase the
level of environmental noise and thus the identified problem of environmental noise will remain
unsettled.
Additionally, for that reason is recommended:

      Reduction of vehicle driving speed by 20-30 km/h on stations where housing buildings in
       Tabanovce and Dolno Konjare are located. This measures will contribute for noise
       reduction of 2-3 dB (A);

      Placement of appropriate road signalization by which drivers will be informed in time on
       the permissible driving speed, thus avoiding sudden breakings and accelerations.
Also, in case of possible reconstruction of the road section in future, the alternative for selection
of appropriate construction materials should be taken into consideration in order to obtain „quiet
asphalt? which will certainly contribute to noise reduction from 3-8 dB (A).
Implementation of the environmental standards and best technology in the vehicle production
industry will benefit on decreasing of the noise levels generated by the traffic in the future.

?генцијата за државни патишта-Скопје ?проведе проект за рекон?трукција и надградба на
делницата Табановце-Куманово што е дел од Коридорот X, на ниво на автопат, во вкупна
должина од 7.62 km.
Со цел да ?е утврди влијанието врз животната ?редина и здравјето на на?елението од
имплементацијата на Проектот подготвена е ОВЖС ?тудија во која ?е идентификувани
можните влијанија врз животната ?редина и здравјето на на?елението и мерки за нивно
намалување или елиминирање. Во Студијата ?е разработени и а?пектите на бучавата.
За надминување на идентификуваните влијанија од бучавата во ОВЖС Студијата
предвидена е мерка по?тавување на заштитни ѕидови (бетон?ки или метални) на локации
кои поминуваат низ на?елените ме?та, одно?но во Долно Коњаре и дел од Табановце.
Сметајќи дека жителите, кои имаат ?вои куќи во непо?редна близина на ?втопатот, може
да бидат за?егнати од зголеменото ниво на бучава предизвикани од ?ообраќајот,
Инве?титорот подготви и О?новен проект за заштита од бучава Табановце-Куманово
делницата од Е759.

?а база на детални анализи и пре?метки и ?помнатиот проект предлага изградба на
заштитни бариери. ?едо?татокот на разработка на други алтернативи/опции за
намалување на бучавата во О?новниот проект за заштита од бучава, наложи
разгледување на дополнителни алтернативни мерки за намалување на бучавата во
подрачјата на делницата, каде ?е ?мета дека има о?етливи рецептори, одно?но
афектирано на?еление.

За таа цел, ?генцијата за државни патишта, како нарачател на у?лугата, побара од
Кон?ултатот Менка Спиров?ка, овла?тен ек?перт за оцена на влијанијата врз животната
?редина, да подготви ?нек?, во кој ќе бидат разгледувани ?оодветни алтернативни мерки
за намалување на бучавата во оперативната фаза на Проектот и да ?проведе процедура
на кон?ултации ?о за?егнатото на?еление чии објекти за живеење ?е наоѓаат во
непо?редна близина на делницата.
Целта за анализа и утврдување на дополнителни, алтернативни, мерки за намалување на
влијанијата од бучавата предизвикани од ?ообраќајот е изнаоѓање нај?оодветно решение
кое ќе обезбеди цело?на заштита од зголеменото ниво на бучава врз за?егнатото
на?еление, а и?то така за Инве?титорот ќе биде прифатливо од а?пект на оддржливо?т и
економ?ки а?пект.

   ?нализираната делница од автопатот е рекон?труирана и и?тата е во употреба;
   Зголемено ниво на бучава долж тра?ата на автопатот е евидентно ?о години и
    локалното на?еление, кое живее близу до автопатот, е изложено на зголемено
    ниво на бучава;
   Локалното на?еление нема чув?тво дека е загрозено од бучавата од патот;
   Во текот на проце?от на проектирање, проектантот не можел да ги примени
    о?новните правила за проектирање на автопат во одно? на почитување на
    оддалечено?та на зоните за домување, бидејќи ?танувало збор за веќе по?тоечки
    пат;
   Повеќето од автомобилите и тешките возила кои транзитираат по автопатот ?е
    ?тари и генерираат зголемено ниво на бучава;
   Дозволената брзина на движење на возилата по рекон?труираната делница
    изне?ува 130 km/h;
   Оддалечено?та на објектите за домување од автопатот и терен?ките у?лови, не
    даваат можно?т за имплементација на различни решенија за намалување на
    нивото на бучава во животната ?редина, која ќе биде во ?огла?но?т ?о
    дозволените гранични вредно?ти за ниво на бучава (регулирана во националната
    правна рамка);
   Имплементацијата на алтернативи кои промовираат ин?тaлација на звучни
    бариери ќе биде ?оодветно решение за намалување на нивото на бучава на онаа
    ?трана каде што ќе биде по?тавена бариерата, но не и на животната ?редина
    за?егната од зголемено ниво на бучава, во цело?т (на двете ?трани од патот);
   Повеќето од интервјуираните луѓе ?е изја?нија дека ?е против по?тавување на
    звучни бариери, нагла?увајќи дека тие може да предизвикаат негативно чув?тво кај
    жителите (чув?тво на затворено?т, ќе ?е ограничат визурите, нема да има ?труење,
    ќе ?е промени пределот);
   ?а одредени делови од автопатот, про?торот помеѓу автопатот и зоната за
    домување е толку те?на, така што по?тавување на бариери не е возможно ниту
    безбедно;
   ?е ?е ?ретнати други о?етливи рецептори во предметното подрачје и долж тра?ата
    на автопатот. Ова значи дека мерки за намалување на нивото на бучава треба да
    ?е имплементираат ?амо во објектите за домување кои ?е најза?егнати (локалното
    на?еление) во ?елата Долно Коњаре и Табановце.
   Подобрувања треба да ?е направат на ?ите објекти, кои ?е во првата линија,
    најбли?ку до автопатот.
За да ?е провери разми?лувањето на за?егнатите жители, ?генцијата организира
?о?танок на кој подетално ќе ?е презентираат мерките за намалување на бучавата.
По?ле овие кон?ултации ќе ?е доне?е одлука за примена на нај?ооддветна мерка, која
ќе биде прифатлива за ?ите заинтере?ирани ?трани.

8.2.2.1 Minutes of meeting (village Dolno Konjare)

On 28.05.2012 at 12.00 pm in the Local community in village Dolno Konjare was held public
presentation of the content of Annex to environmental impact assessment study of the highway
Tabanovce-Kumanovo.

The meeting was attended by the local citizens who are affected by the noise generated by the
traffic on the reconstructed road, EIA Consultant, representatives from Agency of State Roads
and the supervisor of the activities on the road.

The content of the Annex was presented by the Consultant engaged by the Agency for State
roads.
After the presentation, the people affected by the traffic noise, expressed their opinions about
the noise and how they perceive it and gave their suggestions.
Some of the comments and suggestions are given below.
Goran Petkovic: Our house is located 60 meters away from the highway. That is why the
presented alternative for replacement of the windows and doors is a good solution. Barriers are
not proper solution due to the small distance between the houses and the highway.
Sande Kuzmanovski: Installation of windows and doors are good solution for indoor noise
reduction, for the facilities which are more distant from the highway. For others, more suitable
solution is installation of noise barriers, especially for the facilities on the position km 7+348 to
km 7+525. The argumentation of this opinion is that the vehicles driving on the highway with
high speeds (about 130 km/h) generate increased noise level. My suggestion is reduction of the
driving speed.
Goran Aleksic: My home is situated at the position km 7+348 to km 7+525 (the nearest object
on the highway). The best solution for noise reduction and safe protection of these houses is
installation of concrete barrier.
Branislav Aleksic: Sound barriers are proper solution for position km 7+348 to km 7+525,
because this houses as a nearest to the highway is the most exposed on noise and installation
of barriers are required from safety aspects.
The meeting ended at 13.00 pm after elaborate discussion.

8.2.2.2 Minutes of meeting (village Tabanovce)

On 29.05.2012 at 12.00 pm in village Tabanove was held public presentation of the Annex to
environmental impact assessment study of the highway Tabanovce-Kumanovo. As a result of
the lack of adequate space in the Local community, for that purpose, the presentation was held
in the private home at one of the interested inhabitance of the village.

The meeting was attended by the local citizens who are affected by the noise generated by the
traffic on the reconstructed road, EIA Consultant, representatives from Agency of State Roads
and the supervisor of the activities on the road.

The content of the Annex was presented by the Consultant engaged by the Agency for State
roads.
After the presentation, the people affected by the traffic noise, expressed their opinions about
the noise and how they perceive it and gave their suggestions.
Some of the comments and suggestions are given below.
Stoilko Pavlovski: With reconstruction and upgrading of the highway the noise level is
reduced, because with expansion of the road, part of the traffic is moved further from residential
objects. Noise is not a big problem for the inhabitants and with replacement of the windows and
doors complete protection of the indoor noise will be provided.
Marjan Trajanovic: Replacement of the windows and doors will contribute for noise reduction in
the homes, but environmental noise in the future will remain. Increased noise level can provoke
disturbance of the people which spare their time in the yards. Also, increased noise level could
be a problem in future for the inhabitants of Tabanovce which are planning to build new
residential objects. In that case, the Agency for State roads has to invest in the all new
residential objects for installation soundproof windows and doors. Our request is installation of
transparent sound barrier for position km 2+000 to 2+170.
Stole Trajanovic: He shares the same opinion as Marjan Trajanovic.
EIA Consultant: Agency for State roads is obliged to solve the problem related to the traffic
noise only for the existing buildings. In the future, everyone who is interested for building of the
new buildings have to take into consideration existence of the highway and noise generated by
the traffic. The choice for construction of the buildings near to the highway is personal decision
and problem with the noise everyone have to solve independently.
Apart from this opinion, almost all of the rest attendees (Trajanovic Borivoje, Milorad Angelkovic,
Boris Dodevski, Bojkovska Svetlana, Velkovski Zoran) are agreed that replacing of the windows
and doors is suitable solution for noise protection in their homes. According to their opinion, the
barriers will provoke effects of shade and feeling of enclosures and this alternative as a solution
for noise reduction was rejected.

    8.3 Conclusions after public consultation
After the consultations with affected public and presentation of the content of the Annex to
environmental impact assessment study of the highway Tabanovce-Kumanovo (villages Dolno
Konjare and Tabanovce), the EIA Consultant presents conclusions which have to be
implemented to reduce the noise impact on the human health and environment:
      Replacement of windows and doors and installation of air conditioners is acceptable
       solution for the most of the affected inhabitants from villages Dolno Konjare and
       Tabanovce. For that purposes the Agency of State roads will undertake activity for
       preparation of tender dossier with required technical details about proposed mitigation
       measures;
      At the position 7+348 to km 7+525 in village Dolno Konjare, the owner of the closest
       house proposed installation of sound barriers (option-concrete barrier) in addition to the
       replacement of the windows and doors. The same requirements were highlighted by the
       residents of village Tabanovce on the position km 2+000 to km 2+170. Their proposal is
       installation of the sound barriers (mixed: metal and transparent). The consultant
       recognized that the request from the citizens of village Dolno Konjare is
       acceptable and realistic, due to the fact that the barriers will contribute in terms of
       noise reduction and protection of assets and human life (against
       incidental thrown at vehicles). For implementation of the measure, the consultant
       proposes installation of reinforced concrete barriers “New Jersey Barrier?- (NJB) in the
       length of 25-30 m at the position km 7+348 to km 7+525. The precise length and height
       of the barriers will be determinate in accordance with the present conditions of the
       terrain. For that purposes the Agency of State roads will undertake activity for
       preparation of tender dossier with technical information of a need.
      Reduction of driving speed on the highway (from 130 to 100 km/h) on the sections near
       the mentioned villages and installation of signs are acceptable mitigation measures for
       additional noise reduction by all consulted residents and it should be implemented.
