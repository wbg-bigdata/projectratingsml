1.       Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1      Context at Appraisal

During Project preparation, the central objective for Macedonia was EU membership.           In
December 2005, the European Council granted candidate status to the country and the expectation
was that a decision by EU to start accession negotiations would come relatively soon. The
improvements in transport links and trade facilitation were important steps toward meeting
membership criteria. During this period, Macedonia was still recovering from the disintegration
of Yugoslavia into a number of new states with the breakdown of traditional links between
economic units located in the South Eastern Europe region. Macedonia had to establish trading
relationships with new countries and expand its markets to new regions, especially the EU.

Macedonia is a landlocked country located at the crossroads of transport Corridor X1, and the less
frequented west-east regional transport Corridor VIII (Durres –Tirana – Skopje – Sofia -
Burgas/Varna). Corridor X forms the backbone of Western Balkan transport infrastructure,
connecting Bosnia, Croatia, Macedonia, Kosovo and Serbia with Western Europe, Greece (deep-
sea port of Thessaloniki), Turkey and Central Asia. This north-south transport link in Macedonia
connects Nis and Skopje and other South East European countries to the Greek EU port at
Thessaloniki. This is also the main access point for Kosovo through the Blace Border Crossing
Point (BCP) which connects to Corridor X in Skopje. Thus, high priority was placed on the
improvement of the physical and operational conditions in road and rail along the Nis-Skopje-
Thessaloniki section of Corridor X. The potential benefits expected were a reduction in transport
costs and other trade related transaction costs such as customs and other border agency processing.

The Project titled Second Trade and Transport Facilitation Project (TTF 2) was a scale up from
the Trade and Transport Facilitation in Southeast Europe (TTFSE I) project which closed in
December 20052.        TTFSE I for Macedonia was a US$14.5 million project to reduce non-tariff
costs to trade and transport and to reduce smuggling and corruption at border crossings. TTFSE I
was a part of a regional program aimed to strengthen and modernize the customs administrations
and other border control agencies in Albania, Bosnia, Bulgaria, Croatia, Macedonia, and Romania.
Serbia, Montenegro and Moldova later joined the program bringing the total to eight countries.
In the Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR), TTFSE I was rated satisfactory with
substantial institutional development impact as the performance of Macedonia’s border agencies
improved significantly, reducing border crossing times, increasing customs efficiency and
revenue collection, and supporting customs integrity.

TTFSE I mostly supported technical assistance for reform and funded limited infrastructure
improvements – mainly upgrading border crossing facilities. TTF 2 had an investment focus
upgrading a road segment on Corridor X, promoting the electronic inter-agency and cross border
exchange of trade data, and strengthening the functioning of key transport corridors. The Project
activities were oriented towards compliance with EU pre-accession requirements. The activities
reflected the commitments agreed in the Memorandum of Understanding for the development of
the core transport network between the European Commission and the Western Balkan countries

(Luxemburg, June 2004). In its Progress Report for 2006, the EC noted that Macedonia made
reasonable progress in the area of transport networks, especially through its participation in the
Southeast Europe Transport Observatory and the development of its core regional transport
network, especially Corridor X3.


1.2   Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
approved)

The Project’s objective was to facilitate the movement of trade between the Borrower and
neighboring countries in South East Europe, through removal of selected border-zone bottlenecks,
and improving the efficiency and quality of road and rail services along Trans-European transport
corridor X in fYR Macedonia4.

Achievement of the PDO was to be confirmed by using the following key indicators:

    (i)       Percentage of reduction in border-crossing waiting time for cars and buses per lane at
              the Blace Border Crossing Point (BCP);
    (ii)      Elimination of freight train processing delays additional to the scheduled 90 minutes
              processing time at rail Corridor X border stations.

Intermediate outcome indicators were:

    (i)       Completion of Physical works for upgrading of 7.3 km section to motorway
              standards, reduced queuing of trucks and improving traffic safety in the Tabanovce
              border zone by full segregation of directional traffic, vehicle types, as well as local
              traffic;
    (ii)      Percentage of completed physical works for border crossing restructuring;
    (iii)     Percentage of improved throughput for cars and buses per lane at border crossing
              Blace (Veh/hr);
    (iv)      Detailed implementation and operational plan for new toll system;
    (v)       Leakage of potential toll revenue collection reduced5;
    (vi)      Modern railways telecommunication system connecting with Serbia, Greece, Kosovo,
              Tabanovce, Skopje, Volkovo and Gevgelija;
    (vii)     Procedures, protocols, and technology to share relevant data and information agreed
              upon by Customs and Railways and Interface established.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by the original approving authority) and Key
Indicators, and reasons/justification.

  The Project also supported the recommendation of the 2005 Networks for Peace and Development which posited that
for South Eastern Europe, there needed to be better integration of national networks to foster regional cooperation
between the EU and its neighbors, as well as among the neighboring countries themselves.
4
  Annex 3 (Results Framework) of the PAD was incorporated into the Minutes of Negotiation as Attachment 5 so there
are no discrepancies in the performance indicators. As to the PDO, the Loan Agreement has two slight differences in
the statement of PDO. In the Loan Agreement: (i) border-zone infrastructure bottlenecks and (ii) on the territory of the
Borrower instead of in fYR Macedonia. The italics are in the Loan Agreement. The discrepancies are not material.

  This indicator was dropped as a result of the May 2010 Restructuring.

The PDO was not revised but one intermediate indicator was dropped during the May 2010
Restructuring when Component 3 was substantially reduced in scope. This component originally
consisted of two parts. The first was the development of the specifications for modern electronic
tolling equipment. The study for this part was completed. The second consisted of the physical
provision and installation of modern electronic tolling equipment. This second part was cancelled
due to the Government’s decision in 2009 to proceed with the toll modernization on Corridor X
as a part of a larger motorway concessioning program.             The reduction in the scope for
Component 3 meant that the key performance indicator (vi) “significant leakages of toll revenue
collection, facilitated by automated vehicle counts and classifications? was dropped.

1.4      Main Beneficiaries

The main beneficiaries are exporters, traders and road users including residents of other South
East Europe (SEE) countries. The reduction of non-tariff constraints lowers transport and trade
transaction costs, and consequently, causes the reduction of the economic distance to markets.
Freight transporters benefited from the improved efficiency at the Macedonia Railways and
Customs Administrations by the upgrading of telecommunication and data transfer. Macedonia’s
manufacturers benefitted from the installation by Customs of new software facilitating the
processing of international and domestic trade and transport documentation, which also enhances
trade and competitiveness. The upgrading of the section of the road Corridor X between Border
Crossing Point (BCP) of Tabanovce – Kumanovo benefit cross border road users between Serbia
and Macedonia; the Tabanovce BCP operates now 24/7. The secondary beneficiaries are the
local communities along the upgraded road. They now have better access to the Corridor and
improved connectivity to employment, trade, education, and social opportunities. The upgrading
of the passenger terminal at the Blace BCP benefits passenger traffic between Kosovo and
Macedonia. The secondary beneficiaries are the border personnel because of improved working
conditions in Blace.

1.5      Original Components

The Project loan amounted to €15.0 million – equivalent to US$20.0 million6 – and was expected
to fund the following five components:

Component 1: Upgrading road corridor X, the section from BCP of Tabanovce to Kumanovo, to
motorway standards (€10.7 million)
The component supported the construction of a new one-directional carriageway with a width of
11 meters, parallel to the existing road, separated from it by a 4-meter median. The existing
parallel road was made one-directional, and widened from what was 7.5 meters to 11 meters. The
total length of the upgraded section is 7.3km. The detailed designs dated from 1995 following
German DIN standards 7 for 4-lane motorways.         The design included provisions for traffic
management in the approach to the Tabanovce border crossing station, eliminating mixed
queuing of trucks, buses, and passenger vehicles, as well as mitigating traffic accident risks
resulting from queuing vehicles. The component included the consultancy contract for the
supervision of construction.

Component 2: Upgrading the passenger terminal at the Blace BCP with Kosovo (€1.7 million).

  Because of exchange rate fluctuation, the US dollar amount disbursed in (higher) than the US$20.0 million approved.

This component funded the construction of necessary facilities for the customs, border police and
other related agencies at the border for vehicles. It removed the temporary facilities, replaced
them with permanent control, inspection, and administration structures. The capacity of the
passenger border crossing was increased from 2x2 to 2x3 lanes, with a separate inspection lane
for buses. The component included the consultancy contract for the supervision of civil works.

Component 3: Modernizing the Road Toll collection System (€4.5 million).
The component would retrofit the toll stations along Corridor X with new equipment that would
allow for both cash and non-cash (electronic) payments. At the time of Project preparation, the
toll collection system was a cash system with substantial leakages of potential toll revenues. This
component supported technical assistance to develop the specifications for the toll equipment that
met the system’s requirements, as well as preparation of the procurement documents for the
purchase of such modern electronic tolling equipment. The component also funded the purchase
of the new toll system.

Component 4: Support completion of telecommunication system modernization along rail
Corridor X and support harmonization of freight data software applications by Railways and
Customs (€3.1 million)
There were two inter-related subcomponents: one subcomponent supported the Macedonian
Railways (MZ) in the completion of a modernized railway telecommunication system that would
allow the use of electronic train management applications along rail corridor X, including the
provision of essential software modules. The other subcomponent supported the Macedonia
Customs Administration (MCA) in the modernization of hardware, system, equipment, and
software applications that would allow electronic rail freight data processing using data from the
selected Railways software application through an interface with the MCA information systems.
MCA and MZ freight data sharing would speed up the processing and electronic recording of
freight customs declarations, etc.

Component 5: Project implementation support (€0.4 million)
This component covered the usual goods and services required to support the successful Project
implementation such as audit services; project management, financial management, procurement,
technical services, training and incremental operating costs. The project was implemented by
staff of ASR, MZ and MCA (i.e. civil servants), so there were no PIU related consultant expenses.

1.6     Revised Components

In the Level 2 Restructurings in May and in December of 2010, the scope of the components was
revised and funds reallocated. The percentage of expenditures to be financed from the loan was
increased from 78% to 100%. The provision and installation of modern electronic tolling
equipment under Component 3 was removed as per the Government’s request, as the Government
intended to include toll equipment installation as part of a larger motorway concession scheme
outside of the Project. The procurement of information technology equipment and the
procurement of software for data exchange between MZ and MCA under Component 4 were
removed because it became unnecessary as Customs had migrated to a web based system. This
reduction in scope for Component 4 did not require a change in project performance indicators.
The financing was reallocated as indicated below:

1.7      Other Significant Changes

Besides the revisions in the Project components and funding percentage, the May 2010
Restructuring also amended the Resettlement Action Plan           The revised RAP provides for
compensation to be made to all affected people through: (i) the Agency for State Roads (ASR)
with a special account into which it deposits in full the money determined as required and (ii) for
the Macedonia Customs Administration, a dedicated budget line or, where compensation amount
determined by the courts, the Treasury as Customs is a unit of the Ministry of Finance. The Loan
Agreement was revised to reflect an updated approach to land acquisition. In addition, there
were two additional Level 2 Restructurings approved in June 2011 and March 2012 which
extended the Closing Date in total by nine months from September 30, 2011 to June 30, 2012.


      2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes


2.1      Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

The Project had a long gestation. However, the background analysis for Bank involvement was
sound and was a continuation of the Bank’s involvement in the sector. The PCN Review took
place in December 2004, while the appraisal was more than two years later in April 2007 with
Board Approval in May 2007. The extended preparation time for this Project might have resulted
from the fact that the task team was preparing a regional program to follow up on the first Trade
and Transport Facilitation in Southeast Europe10. As per management recommendation at the



8
  The results of the restructurings from May and December 2010. There were four Level 2 restructurings approved by
the Country Director. The results of the May and December 2010 restructurings are described in Section 1.6. June
2011 Restructuring extended the closing date from September 30, 2011 by six month to March 31, 2012 and the March
2012 Restructuring extended the closing date from March 31, 2012 to June 30, 2012.
9
  The total Project cost was €20, of which the Bank loan originally financed 78%. After the May 2010 Restructuring,
the percentage of expenditures financed from the loan was increased to 100%.
10
   The PCN for the second TTFSE program took place in March 2005, soon after the concept for this Project was
approved The original TTFSE program was focused on road transport and Customs. The proposed second TTFSE
program was to be opened to all eight TTFSE countries, expanding to Kosovo and Turkey and would cover other

                                                       15
PCN, the task team also explored the concept of a horizontal Adaptable Program Loan (APL)11.
These efforts might have diverted time and attention from processing this Project. There was also
a question of commitment from the counterparties. Changes in the Government in 2006
improved the environment for moving the Project forward. A QER review was undertaken in
November 2006 to ensure the project design was consistent with the concept approved at PCN
review. The comments from QER peer reviewers were thorough12.

The Project funded needed investments which would facilitate movement of trade. The
investments matched the objectives. The design of the Project did not change much from
identification to Board even though the preparation was long. In the early stage of project
preparation 13 , the team conducted a workshop in Skopje with the participation of the main
stakeholders: Customs, Ministry of Transport, Ministry of Economy, border agencies, the private
sector and the donor community. The workshop reached a consensus on the need for the Project
which would build on the results of the first Trade and Transport Facilitation and concentrate on
corridor development and strengthen the border agency cooperation. This consensus building
strengthened the commitment of the government officials involved. With the changes in the
Government in 2006, the progress of Project preparation was rapid.

The design was slightly complex with two components for roads, a component for rail and
customs, and a component for customs – all implemented by the respective counterparts. This
complexity was understandable as trade facilitation is a multi-faceted issue and as Macedonia had
a small lending program, a transport project had to cover many areas. The rationale for tying
together the Project components was the development of Corridor X; the design was within the
rubric of trade facilitation with an emphasis on transport infrastructure. The focus of the Project
was to improve transit and trade along Corridor X by: (i) streamlining rail border crossing
procedures and rail information systems, (ii) removing remaining bottlenecks in Corridor X road
infrastructure and optimizing the road toll collection systems, and (iii) improving freight
information flows along Corridor X, building on the integrated border management strategy of
fYR Macedonia. The Project also implemented some of the recommendations from a Bank
study titled “A Framework for the Development of the Transport System in South East Europe?14.
This study was a piece of insightful analytic work which enhanced the Project’s design. The
study recommended, among other things, a corridor approach to transport development 15 and
development of integrated border management principles.

The main issue with the Quality at Entry was the due diligence undertaken on resettlement. A
senior social specialist was involved in project preparation. In the Decision Meeting minutes, the



transport modes such as rail, extend the pilot sites to other BCPs and introduce the program to new areas such as global
security requirements.
11
   An APL would have provided more flexibility by allowing a sequential entry of potential TTFSE II countries into the
program. However, the horizontal APL concept was abandoned because of the different states of readiness of Western
Balkan countries and the accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the EU in 2007 would have made determination of
scope, value, and the timeframe of participation in a regional APL speculative. The team noted in the Decision
Meeting minutes that a key constraint was trade and transport facilitation activities not included in country programs
with no slots or preparation budget available for stand-alone trade and transport facilitation projects.
12
   The team might have been able to incorporate more of the suggestions from QER reviewers were it not for the
compressed time frame between QER and Board approval.

Lead Environmental Specialist confirmed that all safeguard requirements including resettlement
and land acquisition issues had been satisfactorily addressed for appraisal. QAG did not review
the Quality at Entry.

Land acquisition was an issue that received heightened attention by the team during preparation.
The ISDS and the Resettlement Action Plan addressed the land acquisitions needed for
Component 1 in the motorway upgrade in some detail. A total of 102 households were expected
to lose part of their land holdings due to the road expansion. No residence was affected. Upfront
work on expropriation was completed and a census of affected persons was taken. On the other
hand, land acquisition for Component 2 for the Blace BCP was convoluted. During the pre-
appraisal mission in December 2006, the team was informed that contrary to information
previously received, “the land ownership at Blace BCP, about 50% of the land affected by the
proposed border crossing project site is actually privately owned.? 16      The team stated that
“expropriation process in the border zone bears a high risk of delays in implementation and
disbursement plans for the Blace component, which was envisioned for the first year of project
implementation.? The mission noted that similar land expropriation experienced under TTFSE I
for the Tabanovce border crossing modernization resulted in implementation delay. This view
was shared by the Ministry of Finance. The team provided the Government with various options,
among which was to omit this component from the project. There were a number of email
exchanges exploring options to minimize the need for land expropriation at Blace BCP. A few
weeks before negotiations, the Government confirmed that neither construction nor operation of
the Blace BCP would require land acquisition/expropriation17. This understanding was reflected
in the PAD18. Negotiations for the Project proceeded on this basis. Anyway, land acquisition at
Blace became an issue at implementation.

The risks identified in the PAD did not materialize partly because two of the five risks were
related to the modernization of the toll collection system which was dropped from the Project
during implementation. The land acquisition risk was not identified as a risk maybe because
substantial work on social safeguards for Component 1 and land acquisition for Component 2 was
not considered.


2.2 Implementation

The PDO objectives were straightforward, realistic and responsive to the Borrower’s needs. The
implementation of the project activities resulted in meeting the Project performance indicators
without much difficulty. Project implementation was undertaken by ASR, MZ and MCA
separately with their own staff. This implementation arrangement enhanced ownership and
supported knowledge transfer; however, it required a higher level of implementation support from
the Bank team. For example, each entity conducted its own procurement, with involvement from
the Project Coordination Unit within ASR. ASR coordinated the activities for FM and reporting
to the Bank. Project Management was at some point rated MU because ASR project staff was

17
   Attached to email dated April 11, 2007 was a letter from the Ministry of Transport and Communication assuring the
Bank that there was no land acquisition issue at Blace. See also email dated January 11, 2007.
18
   Annex 10, para. 7 of the PAD stated that “No land acquisition is required [for modernizing the Blace passenger
border crossing] since all proposed construction activities will take place within the boundaries of the actual state
owned facility. A small piece of land in the middle of the existing border crossing facility will be purchased from the
actual owner on a voluntary basis. Currently, the border crossing agency has a long term lease to use this land, but the
Ministry of Transport has confirmed plans to purchase it from the owner before commencing the construction.?

                                                          17
overloaded. However, ASR in general did a commendable job in coordinating project activities
with Customs and Railways. As noted in the Decision Meeting minutes and the risk matrix in the
PAD, this implementation arrangement posed risk. It has worked well because of the efforts of
the counterparts and the Bank supervision team.

Project design improved during implementation:

(i) For Component 1, road upgrading. The original road design was from 1995. During
    implementation, there were many design improvements to align the road geometrics to new
    standards, utilize new technology and more significantly to incorporate inputs from local
    communities. The design changes partly explained the 18 percent price increase on the civil
    works compared to the contract price. During implementation, a consulting study not
    originally planned was funded updating motorway road signs to be consistent with EU
    standards. The new road sign designs will be installed for the rest of the Corridor.

(ii) For Component 4, two pieces of software for Customs were added: (a) the Inward Processing
     System19 and (b) the Integrated Information System20. These software investments resulted
     in faster completion of customs procedures, better fiscal collection and decreased corruption
     possibilities and overall improvement of conditions for doing cross border trade. For the
     Inward Processing System, procedures that used to take weeks are now processed in a matter
     of days. Status of application is accessible via the internet and location of the bottleneck
     identified. The Integrated Information System is already used by more than 52,500 users
     with more than 118,500 custom documents/payments computed using the system. In the EC
     Progress Report, these Customs software were cited as contributions to lowering costs to
     private operators, improving processing times by Customs and engendering transparency and
     governance. One piece of software was added for Railways, the integrated financial and
     human resources management. This would improve financial management and operation
     performance for the railways as the labor and operations are now linked. This would allow
     Railways to identify the people involved in each assignment and to better manage its human
     resources and contain costs.

(iii) Measures to mitigate environmental impact also improved during implementation.                            This is
      discussed in Section 2.4

Project delays were not excessive for civil works heavy project

The Project closing date was extended by nine months in total from September 30, 2011 to June
30, 2012. The extension of closing date was within reason and the implementation issues that
arose were not unusual for a project with substantial civil works activities. The implementation
of Component 1 encountered delays from slow mobilization, lack of essential resources to
complete construction21, delay due to design changes and budget constraints of the Borrower22.


19
   The Inward Processing System includes automatic customs confirmation on the quantities of exported finished goods
against the imported materials used as input for export. Processes which were carried out manually were completely
paper-based and could take weeks, are now paperless and processed within a few working days. This not only
improves the efficiency of the customs processing but also reduces corruption opportunities and increases
accountability. The Inward Processing System is particularly beneficial to the textile and steel industries.
20
   This software was the development of an integrated information system. The upgrade has: (i) improved processing
time from 7 minutes to currently 2 minutes, (ii) improved tax collection, (iii) improved operational effectiveness of the
customs administration, (iv) increased security of information and (v) increased transparency of Customs operation.

The implementation period coincided with a time of economic crisis so the lack of counterpart
funding delayed works in some instance. In the 2010 restructuring, the funding from the loan was
increased to 100% of the expenditure thus eliminating the need for counterpart funds. Delay in
civil works was also due to land acquisition issues as construction could not start until land
acquisition was completed. The RAP and Loan Agreement were later revised to allow
expropriation to proceed even though the Court was still adjudicating the land acquisition so long
as adequate funds for the land purchase were set aside in the ASR budget. At the time of Project
closure, there were 4 to 5 cases pending but they have now been adjudicated. Under Macedonia
law, once the Court makes an award, the compensation payment from the state budget is
automatic. The delays in payment of compensation were a serious safeguard violation which
were corrected in time and detracted slightly from the very positive outcome. (See discussion in
Section 2.4.)

Similarly the implementation of Component 2 was delayed because while the Bank received
assurance during project preparation from the Government 23 that there was no need for land
acquisition, at Project implementation it was determined that 27 parcels of land would have to be
acquired24. At Mid Term Review in mid-2009, the bidding documents for the Blace BCP were
still not issued because of unresolved land acquisition issue. Civil works on this Component were
able to proceed because of a change in the law and in the Bank social safeguard practices
mentioned above. For the Blace BCP improvement, the Project funded activities which provided
visible and obvious improvements in Blace operations (i.e., segregation of private vehicle and bus
traffic, facility for buses, improved working conditions for border staff and accessibility to
restrooms and other conveniences such as currency exchange for passengers). At closure,
Component 2 was 97.6 percent completed and the extension to the border crossing which houses
the additional lanes, the bus control facility and the administration building are operational.
However, the rehabilitation of the 200 meters of the old BCP road segment is still not completed
as of the finalization of this ICR. The asphalting of the 200 m2 is not costly and would not take
much time. The contractor’s failure to complete is due to contractual issues on other projects the
contactor has with the Government. Until the other issues are solved, there is little Customs
could do other than paying another contractor to complete the asphalting.

Component 3 (modernizing road toll collection) met the original performance indicator.

The Project included modernization of toll collection system as a project component because it
was found25 that annual toll collection ‘leakages? were between 30 percent and 65 percent of
potential revenue which amounted to €7 million annually. Toll revenues are a principal means
by which the Government recoups its road investments, funds maintenance and gains from transit
traffic26. Any investment on Corridor X road had to address the toll revenue dimension. The
Government has utilized the study funded by this Component to develop bidding documents for




22
   In 2010, funding from the loan was increased to 100% of the expenditure. The implementation period was also a
time of economic crisis so the lack of counterpart funding delayed works in some instance.
23
   In a letter from the Minister of Transport and Communication to Country Manager dated April 10, 2007.
24
   The reason provided was that the Housing Authority which at the time was responsible for the border crossing
facilities was mistaken. The Customs Authority only took over the responsibility for the border crossing facilities
when the law changed in 2008.
25
   Toll collection was cross referenced to traffic counts.
26
   Currently it takes between 1-1/2 hour to 2 hours to drive through Macedonia on Corridor X. Once the Corridor is
completely upgraded, the time is about 1-1/4 hour. Therefore toll revenue is an essential way for Macedonia to capture
some of the benefits of being a transit country.

                                                         19
toll modernization options 27 .   Based on the findings of the study, EBRD is assisting the
Government to concession Corridor X which would include toll equipment upgrade. The
Government in the meantime has improved the toll collection by hiring new toll collectors and
installing automatic vehicle counters which corroborate the toll collections. In 2007, tolls were
collected from 13 million vehicles while in 2011, the figure improved to about 25 million
vehicles. Additional payment options (aside from cash) have been introduced. Traffic police
does random checks on whether car driver has toll receipt. There was also a law change
eliminating toll exemptions from 30 plus categories to just 4 exemption categories. While the
indicator for toll leakages was dropped as a result of 2010 Restructuring, this indicator has
essentially been achieved.


2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

The results framework measured the movement of trade, the first objective, but less so on the
improvement of road and rail services, the second objective. The counterparts had the capacity
to monitor as the indicators were specific to the Project. The key PDO indicators measured
border crossing waiting time for vehicles at Blace road BCP (Component 2), and freight
processing delays at the rail Corridor X border stations (Component 4). These indicators
measured improvement in trade facilitation. The M&E indicators were used to improve Project
performance. The intermediate indicators measured the performance of the four project
components. Given the disparate nature of the components, there was no PDO indicator that tied
the four components together. Component 1 (the road upgrade), at 79 percent of project cost,
was the most significant activity in terms of financing, yet there was no PDO indicator. An
indicator using the International Roughness Index could easily measure the improvement of road
conditions for road users and thus the quality of road services. The M&E design could have been
better . M&E during implementation was rated MU at some point as the data towards
achievement of target had not been fully updated. This was rectified relatively promptly.
Customs also provided the baseline data for Component 2.


2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Safeguard Compliance is rated ‘Moderately Unsatisfactory’

World Bank safeguards specialists participating in preparation and supervision missions. A
detailed safeguard review was completed during Mid Term Review. The civil works were carried
out in compliance with the provisions of the Environmental Management Plan.

The Project was an environmental category “B? project. The environmental compliance did not
have major issues during implementation. Several improvements were made to the original EIA
and EMP. For Component 1, the original EIA recommended sound barriers for noise mitigation
along the upgraded motorway.       Based on technical findings, consultation and villagers’
preference, double glazed windows and air-conditioning for 70 homes were selected as the

  EBRD is working with the Government on the modernization of maintenance and toll collection and looking to
involve the private sector. ASR has about 70 staff. Road maintenance and the collection of tolls are contracted out to
Macedonia Pat, a public enterprise with about 1,600 staff. The toll revenue in 2011 was about €18 million; while the
maintenance expenses were about €15 million of which a large component is labor cost.

                                                         20
preferred option. For Component 2, the EIA mentioned the need to expand the existing waste
treatment unit at the Blace BCP. Customs suggested that a new unit be installed. The EIA was
revised and an EMP drafted. These improvements involved more effort from both the Client and
the Bank team. At the time of finalization of this Report, these two environmental mitigation
measures are close to completion.

Land acquisition was a recurrent issue during Project preparation and implementation. Land
acquisition was anticipated for Component 1, the road upgrade. There were about 102 affected
owners involving about 294 parcels of land. A Resettlement Action Plan was disclosed and
consultations held during project preparation. In March 2009, the Bank team discovered that
compensation for land acquisition for Component 1 was not paid to all landowners prior to start
of works by the contractor (as some landowners initiated court cases to increase compensation
amounts), contrary to the provisions of the RAP and the Loan Agreement. The Bank sent a
Warning of Suspension of Disbursement for the part of the Loan related to the road upgrade.
This issue was resolved a few months later when the Bank and the Government agreed that the
RAP and Loan Agreement would be modified to reflect Bank policy effective after this Project
was approved. Works were allowed to proceed if the availability of funds for compensation
payment was assured. The local law was also changed. The implementing entity for Component
1, ASR, had the capacity to implement social safeguard. At the time of this Report, all land
acquisition cases have been adjudicated.

Land acquisition for Component 2, the Blace BCP, was minor but unanticipated. The RAP was
revised during Implementation to include Blace. The resolution of land acquisition at Blace
delayed the start of civil works for more than two years. More important, the possibility of land
acquisition at Blace was glossed over in the rush to get to Project negotiations.

Fiduciary Compliance is rated as ‘Satisfactory’.

Fiduciary Compliance is rated satisfactory although FM had been rated by the team as moderately
satisfactory because the accounting was completed on Excel spreadsheet and proper FM software
was not used. However, during implementation of the Project, the FM function was well-staffed
by an experienced full time specialist who was familiar with Bank FM and disbursement
procedures. Financial and audit reports under the Project were submitted generally on time.
The auditors issued unqualified opinions on the project financial statements for the audited period
of FY 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011. It should be noted that ASR has plans to update its FM
system as a part of introducing an enterprise network system, financed through another Bank
operation. Procurement has been satisfactory. It should be noted that IT procurement could be
difficult to implement under Bank procedures as the Terms of Reference cannot be so technically
specific as to limit vendors but not too general as to not meet the requirements. The capacity of
the counterparts supported by the Bank’s IT procurement specialist have accomplished the
procurement without issues.


2.5 Post Completion Operation/Next Phase

TTF 2 is a successful project. ASR has hired the consultants that worked on Component 1 as
permanent staff. The capacity ASR gained from this operation will be applied in the next phase
of the Corridor X road upgrade which just started in September 2012 and is financed by EBRD,
EIB, EU and Government. After this, the entire road Corridor X in Macedonia would be at
motorway standard. As mentioned, EBRD is assisting the Government to prepare Corridor X for

                                                21
concessioning; the private sector besides toll collection would have operations and maintenance
obligations. Blace BCP is operating smoothly. When Bank transport team members travelled
recently from Kosovo via Macedonia to Belgrade, they confirmed that border crossing at Blace
was efficient as noted during the ICR field trip.        The other project activities are already
integrated into various counterparts’ operations. The benefits of the software investments are
obvious and would be maintained and improved as the counterparts have competent IT
departments.

During this time of fiscal constraints and economic turmoil, it is essential to improve
Macedonia’s competitiveness through cost efficient investments that promote growth. Corridor X
is the country’s most important transport link and is a resource to be leveraged. Among the
possibilities are: (i) rehabilitation of national roads that link into Corridor X with a focus on
improving access to market for agricultural products, outputs from automotive, garment and
footwear industries and other employment generating sectors,. (ii) development of agricultural
collection points with road links to facilitate small farmers to sell to high income markets, and
(iii) initiate dialogue on trade facilitation with the Government of Greece to solve transit issues on
the Greek side as improving Corridor X has to be a regional effort.


       3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The Project’s objectives remain very relevant to Macedonia. The circumstances for Macedonia
have not changed since Project preparation. The CPS for fYR of Macedonia for FY 11- 14 stated
that the country’s future growth and development will depend fundamentally on the pace of EU
accession. One of the main objectives is faster growth by improving competitiveness. Efforts
include reducing bottlenecks in the business environment and infrastructure. The Project’s
objective of removing bottlenecks on Corridor X remains relevant as this Corridor is transport
link for Southeastern Europe with Western Europe, the seaport in Greece and Turkey. The
Project’s objectives were to (i) facilitate the movement of trade and (ii) improve the efficiency
and quality of road and rail services. The design of the results framework had deficiencies.
While the indicators measured well the first objective, i.e., the movement of trade, no indicator
was included to measure the increase in efficiency and quality of the road and rail services. After
a project restructuring, one of the intermediate indicators, i.e., the installation of toll collection
equipment was dropped after the Government decided to pursue a private financed option.
Dropping one of seven intermediate indicators did not impact the relevance of the design.

The Project activities directly support trade and results are significant in terms of timesaving and
improved competitiveness. Corridor X is one of the Pan European corridors which is of high
priority for EU transport investments. The implementation arrangement was relevant as it was
consistent with Project design; the road agency, Railways and Customs separately implementing
their specific component. The implementation support provided by the team while labor intensive
transferred knowledge and enhanced capacity in the various beneficiary organizations.

The high importance of the Project’s objective and design has also been highlighted in the First
Programmatic Competitiveness DPL for Macedonia presented to the Board in November 201228.


28
     Program Document, Report No. 67989-MK.

                                                 22
One pillar of the DPL is to improve the efficiency of trade logistics services and build upon the
achievements in trade facilitation under the Project and is focusing on further improvements on
border processing times.


3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives.

The achievement of the PDO was rated as ‘Satisfactory’.

PDO indicators and the intermediate outcome indicators were all fully met. The civil works at
the Blace BCP while not fully completed, did not impact the achievement of the indicators. See
Data Sheet for details. Moreover, the activities of the Project contributed to the achievement of
the PDO in ways that were not measured in the Results Framework. For the first PDO, the
facilitation of trade: (i) the motorway upgrade segregated freight traffic near the Tabanovce BCP
and established a road link to the border processing terminal where all border agencies (customs,
phyto-sanitary, veterinarian agency) are now located, saving traders and transporters time and
costs. Import freight now only makes one stop at terminal and export freight can now pass the
border directly without any stops; (ii) the new telecommunication system in railways has led to
initiatives for joint operation of border railway stations with Serbia and Kosovo; and (iii) the
software upgrades at Customs simplified customs processing with efficiency gains that dwarfed
the modest financial investment. For the second PDO, the Project did not incorporate
measurement of design for improvement in efficiency and quality road and rail services.
However, these are some of the key achievements: (i) the Project’s road and rail investments
generated significant benefits including at least USD440,00029, (ii) a dual carriageway, with a
separate medium, significantly improved safety, (iii) the road signs have been modernized and are
consistent with EU standards and will be implemented to the rest of the Corridor, (iv) the revised
motorway design improved access and safety for the local population and (v) the conditions of
the road have improved as the quality of the ride is smooth. While the evaluation of the PDO
would have merited an Highly Satisfactory evaluation, the lack of measurement for efficiency and
quality of road and rail services was a factor to finally rate this as Satisfactory.

3.3 Efficiency

The Efficiency of the Project was rated as ‘Satisfactory’.

The Project’s efficiency in this ICR was analyzed using the same methodology as at Appraisal.
Efficiency in achieving the PDO in terms of EIRR is at 12.5% taking into consideration
Component 1 for the road upgrade and Component 4 for the purchase of the rail corridor
communication equipment. It must be said that the benefit of the Project is much more than the
road users’ costs saving resulting from the motorway upgrade and the revenues from leasing the
excess capacity on the fiber optic cables. The other benefits of the Project including the time
savings at the Blace BCP30 and at Tabanovce BCP31 and for the freight train processing32 and the
efficiencies in Customs processing due to software upgrades would, if measured, substantially
improve the EIRR of the Project.         Unfortunately, these efficiency gains are difficult to

   This was a PDO indicator. The timesaving for vehicles at the Blace BCP dropped from 10 minutes per vehicle at
entrance to 2.5 minutes and 12 minutes at exit to 1.9 minutes.
31
   Refer to Section 3.2 for details.
32
   This was a PDO indicator. Freight train processing has dropped from 450 minutes to the scheduled 90 minutes.

                                                        23
substantiate except anecdotally. Even so, the ex post EIRR of 12.5% is within the range of
acceptability.

The ex-ante economic analysis of the project: NPV @ 12% was € 131.6 million and EIRR was
144.28%. The analysis evaluated separately three project components because each component
captured varying types of benefits and had different expected economic life. The evaluation did
not take into account the Blace passenger terminal component, as the required data for evaluating
benefits could not be obtained. Table 1 presents the ex-ante economic analysis results.

    Overall                                                              20.0           144.3

As shown, the economic return for the road upgrade has always been on the low side at 12.3%,
while the return on improvement on the toll collection system was substantial.

In the ex-post analysis the road upgrade (Component 1) and the purchase of the rail corridor
communication equipment (Component 4) were evaluated. Economic analysis was not calculated
for the Blace upgrade (Component 2). For Component 3, installation of toll equipment was
dropped, although toll collection improved from 13 million vehicles in 2007 to 25 million
vehicles in 2011. The road upgrade analysis used the actual construction costs which were 18
percent higher than the appraisal estimate and 10 percent higher than the contract amount and the
actual traffic growth rate from 2008 to 2012 which was 5 percent higher than the one estimated at
appraisal. As noted previously, much of the construction cost increase was the result of design
revisions which improved access, reduce environmental and social costs and updated the design
based on new standards. The traffic growth might have been even higher but for the economic
crisis in Greece during this period. The ex-post economic analysis shows that the EIRR of
Component 1 decreases to 11.40 percent compared to the appraisal estimate of 12.3 percent.

The rail corridor communication optical network is used for connectivity needs to connect the
tele-commands systems, video surveillance, IP telephony, and IT network. The benefits of its
usage include connections to remote systems and relief from expenses for telecommunication
services. The other benefit is that the free capacity of the optical network is leased to telecom
operators and other renters. The ex-post evaluation of the purchase of the rail corridor
communication equipment yields an EIRR of 21.0 percent considering the initial investment of
€1.79 million and revenues realized annually from the lease/rent of part of the excess capacity on
the fiber optics cable at approximately €400,000 per year. Table 2 presents the ec onomic
evaluation results of the overall project. The ex-post overall project EIRR is 12.5 percent and the
actual total NPV is €0.44 million.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory

This Project has delivered on the results as all indicators for the Project (PDO and Intermediate)
were met. The results achieved in meeting the PDO were beyond the targets for the indicators.
One intermediate indicator was dropped as a result of a 2010 Restructuring. However, the
outcome rating was assessed as satisfactory before and after the Restructuring. The EIRR on
investments that were measurable was above 12 percent.            In addition, the Project improved
during implementation the revisions in road design and the development of software for Customs.
While a new toll system was dropped, the Government made a concerted effort to improve toll
collection on the existing equipment and steps are now underway to upgrade the toll system on
the entire Corridor X. The communication and IT upgrades for Railways and Customs were not
costly activities, however, their impact on efficiency and transparency has proved to be
substantial based on feedback from manufacturers and private companies. Blace BCP still has
minor civil works outstanding. However, the processing of vehicles at Blace BCP is efficient so
the PDO indicator related to Blace has been met.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

       (a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

The Project was not designed from the perspective of poverty alleviation and social development.
However, the revisions of the motorway design incorporating consultations with communities
added important mobility, access, and social features that resulted in unanticipated secondary
benefits. It also raised the awareness in ASR of the relevance of stakeholders’ consultation on
road design which is not required for Bank’s safeguard purposes.

       (b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

The technical support provided to the staff of the beneficiary organizations that implemented the
project has provided direct capacity building for these organizations. The software solutions are
IT investments that promote institutional change. For instance, in the Inward Processing System,
all procedures are web based, the approval process takes a few days and the status of the approval
can be checked via the internet. This openness of information has increased transparency,
facilitated trade and reduced the possibility of corruption. The system also freed up the Customs
staff from paper work to more analytic assessment of submissions. The introduction of integrated

                                                         25
financial and human resource management software at MZ will facilitate a more efficient
deployment of staff, better costing and operation management will strengthen financial
management of MZ. The road signal study, besides improving traffic safety on the project road
segment, will contribute to better integration of road safety in road design and operation as the
recommendations of the study are being introduced to the rest of the corridor and other major
roads in Macedonia.

    (c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive/negative)

The Project funded the installation of fiber optic cables for MZ. There are surplus fiber optic
capacities which are made available on a remunerative basis to communication companies. This
has resulted in the development of competitive communication services in Macedonia. The
demonstrative efforts of success MIS implementation in MZ have encouraged others government
entities such as ASR to adapt modern information systems. These are some of the unintended
positive outcomes. The Macedonian freight companies have benefitted from the improved
efficiency of customs processing and road improvements. There are more than 2000 road freight
companies based in Macedonia. They compete for business all over Europe.


3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

A beneficiary survey was not carried out.

    4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Low

The risk to Development Outcome is low as the benefits of the investments are already apparent
and the feedbacks from beneficiaries have been positive. Proper maintenance for the road
upgrade is essential to achieve the expected benefits. ASR, the road agency, receives at least 20
percent of the excise tax on petrol so there is a source of revenue other than annual budget
allocation. If Corridor X is concessioned, the risk of inadequate maintenance would be reduced.
The MZ and MCA have technical departments that will continue supporting the implementation
of the software and IT solutions. Proper upkeep of the Blace BCP is not much of a risk.



    5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory.

The Quality at Entry is rated as moderately satisfactory. The Project components were well
chosen after a stakeholders’ workshop and were thus demand driven and the counterparties were
committed to the Project supported activities. Overall the Project was well conceived – a corridor
concept with an infrastructure investment focus. The road design which was from 1995 could
have benefitted from some updating during project preparation. However, the rating is most

                                               26
impacted by the land acquisition needs for Blace which was not identified at Project preparation.
This has resulted in subsequent implementation delays. The Bank overrelied on the
Government’s representation of the situation at the Blace BCP. The Bank should have done its
own due diligence. The PCN review, the QER and the Decision Meeting all delved into relevant
Project issues. Quality assurance at entry was appropriate.

(b) Quality at Supervision
Rating: Highly Satisfactory.

The Project started with a number of negative features. The original road upgrade design was
dated. During implementation, the design improved: replacing an overpass with a butterfly
junction which improved access for nearby villages, heightening an underpass to allow for a
school bus to transport students from both sides of a village, improving drainage to prevent
flooding, moving a junction by a few hundred meters to reduce land acquisition and lower the
impact of pollution and, lastly, building a road spur from the main road to the customs facilities to
divert freight traffic and relieve congestion at the Tabanovce BCP. There was a road sign study
and new road signs were installed. Many of the benefits arising from Component 1 were due to
the actions of the Supervision team. Land acquisition both for the road upgrade and for the
Blace BCP, if handled improperly, could have resulted in reputational damage to the Bank. The
Loan covenant violation for road upgrade was efficiently resolved.           The social safeguards
documentation was revised to include Blace. Response from the Bank team was quick but no
short cut was taken.

Besides addressing inherent problems, the Supervision team was proactive. The IT investments
and the new environmental mitigations were added in the latter part of Project implementation.
These actions contributed to the Project’s positive results. There was no real problem with
implementation except for delays which were beyond the Bank’s control. The supervision team
included specialists in road engineering, rail, environment and social safeguards, and IT
procurement. The technical expertise was evident as the team improved many technical aspects
of the project. The Mid Term Review was comprehensive, the aide memoires and ISRs were, in
general, very detailed and there was active project management as reflected in the four
restructurings. The management of the Project from the Skopje office, in the latter part of the
supervision period, provided more timely and hands on assistance to the Borrower.

The counterparts (road agency, Railways, Customs) were very appreciative of the Bank support
throughout Implementation. For this and the reasons cited above, the Quality at Supervision is
rated Highly Satisfactory.

(c)Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory.

The Satisfactory rating for overall Bank performance resulted from: (i) a moderately satisfactory
rating for the quality at entry; and (ii) a highly satisfactory rating for the Project supervision that
improved the project components and provided substantial technical support to the Government.

    5.2 Borrower Performance

    (a) Government Performance
        Rating: Moderately Satisfactory


                                                  27
The rating of the Government’s performance is impacted chiefly by the inaccuracies regarding
land acquisition at the Blace BCP. This has resulted in substantial delay in the implementation
of Component 2. Otherwise, the Government has been responsive in handling issues as they arise
– such as the compliance with RAP on Component 1. The revision of law in toll collection and
the police action against toll collectors demonstrated that the Government was committed to
reforming the tolling regime. At times, the difficulty in securing counterpart funding has resulted
in delays. However, it is understandable given the economic situation and fiscal constraints
during the implementation period. The success of this Project is due in large part to an enabling
environment engendered by the Government that promotes accountability, transparency and
institutional reform.

    (b) Implementation Agency or Agencies Performance

        Rating: Satisfactory

The performance of ASR is satisfactory. The violation of the social safeguards covenant on land
acquisition was because of the contractor which was unintentional and quickly resolved. ASR
actively worked to improve the project design and performed well its coordinating function in
project implementation. The civil works, EMP and RAP were all implemented satisfactorily.
MZ performance is highly satisfactory. MZ’s technology department conceptualized the software
and IT needs and drafted the ToRs which in some countries would require substantial Bank inputs.
ASR and MZ worked with the Bank as partners. The staff assigned to implement the Project is
very capable.

However, these two agencies’ ratings are impacted somewhat by the performance of MCA.
MCA assumed responsibilities for border crossing facilities from the Housing Authority. While
they worked hard to implement Component 2, the Blace BCP was delayed and civil works were
not fully completed at Project Close. MCA’s headquarter staff implementation of the software
is highly satisfactory. The feedback from the private sector users was very positive.

    (c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

        Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The overall Borrower performance was rated as ‘moderately satisfactory’ because of the
moderately satisfactory Government performance and the satisfactory Implementing Agencies
performance.

    6. Lessons Learned

The Bank’s due diligence on all project aspects is essential even when there is time pressure for
project delivery. Reliance on representation is not an excuse. The land acquisition issue at Blace
resulted in time delay but in the end did not impact the Project’s outcome. However, a similar
situation on a large scale project which had not been resolved and remedied very soon could have
a much more negative outcome including reputational risk to the Bank.

In trade facilitation, some essential investments are not costly. The impact of these investments
on institutional reform, however, could be immense. The various software and IT activities are
minor investments compared to the civil works.             These investments, however, require
disproportionate efforts from the Bank in technical and procurement support. Although it is not

                                                28
the case in Macedonia, the failure rate of IT investments in transport projects tends to be high.
One reason for success of this Project is that MZ and MCA both have a high level of IT literacy.
For instance, they both have technical departments which designed the software specifications.
These were client-driven processes.       The lesson is that software and IT activities can be
transformational for an organization. However the Bank has to be willing to invest the time for
implementation support and the counterparty needs to have a basic level of IT competence.

Consultations on road design are not always undertaken to produce a better design. In this
Project, community inputs have resulted in a better designed investment for the road upgrade.
The revision in the motorway design after consultation added social development features for the
Project and wider stakeholders’ support.

Lastly, the Project’s implementation arrangement has some duplication of efforts. However, the
utilization of public sector staff in project implementation instead of a PIU structure resulted in
much better capacity strengthening and project ownership. Under such arrangement, training for
implementation staff is crucial. In the future, the Bank should agree with the Government on a
package of training at the start of the Project and at Mid Term Review.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

The ex-ante economic analysis of the project evaluated separately three project components
because each component captures varying types of benefits and has different expected economic
life. The components evaluated were the road-to-motorway upgrade (54% of project costs), road
toll collection system (23% of project costs) and railways telecommunication system (15% of
project costs). The evaluation did not take into account the Blace passenger terminal component
(8% of project costs), as required data for evaluating benefits could not be obtained. The overall
Economic Internal Rate of Return (EIRR) of the project was estimated at 144.3 percent. Table 1
presents the ex-ante economic analysis results.

The ex-post economic analysis of the project evaluated the upgrade of the BCP to Tabanovce-
Kumanovo road to motorway standards (Component 1) for which actual project costs and traffic
data is available, and the procurement of the rail corridor communication equipment (Component
4). The ex-post economic analysis of Components 3 was not performed because the provision and
installation of modern electronic tolling equipment under Component 3 was removed of the
project. Component 4 reduced in scope considering that the procurement of information
technology equipment and the procurement of software for data exchange between MZ and MCA
were removed.

The ex-post economic analysis of the upgrade of the BCP to Tabanovce-Kumanovo road was
done following the same methodology and model used on the ex-ante analysis. Road user benefits
(vehicle operation, travel time and accident costs reduction) were evaluated using the Highway
Development and Management Model (HDM-4), which computes road agency and road user
costs over an evaluation period for the with and without project scenarios. The ex-post economic
analysis considered actual construction costs and traffic growth rate.

The Project upgraded a 7.6 km road section on Corridor X to motorway standard improving ride
quality and traffic capacity. The project was appraised in 2007 and the construction contract was
signed in August 2008, with a start date of September 2008. The expected contract end date was
April 2010, but the contract ended in June 2012. The estimated project costs at appraisal was 10.7
million Euros in 2007 prices, the contract amount is 11.7 million Euros in 2008 prices, and the
sum of the actual payments from 2008 to 2012 is 13.28 million Euros. Forty three percent of the
payments occurred in 2011. Table 2 presents the actual construction payments.

The ex-ante economic analysis considered that that the annual traffic growth rate averages 7.0
percent over the evaluation period (25 years), being defined at 8.0 percent per year for the initial
forecasted period and 5.0 percent towards the end. Traffic counts on the BCP to Tabanovce-
Kumanovo road are available from 2008 to 2012, which show that the current 2012 traffic is
4,873 vehicles per day and traffic has increased from 2008 to 2012 at 8.4 percent per year. Thus,

                                                34
the actual annual traffic growth is 5 percent higher than the one estimated at appraisal. Table 4
presents the average annual daily traffic on the project road.

                                                day)

Table 5 presents the current traffic composition, which shows that cars and pickups account for
77 percent of the traffic of the project road.

Considering an increase of 18 percent on the construction costs and a 5 percent increase in the
traffic growth rate from 2008 to 2012, the ex-post economic analysis shows that the EIRR of the
component decreases to 11.40 percent compared to the appraisal estimate of 12.25 percent. The
ex-post evaluation indicates that this component is marginally economically justified at a discount
rate of 12 percent. Table 6 presents the economic evaluation results.

The rail corridor communication optical network is used for connectivity needs to connect the
tele-commands systems, video surveillance, IP telephony, IT network. The benefits of its usage
are: connecting to remote systems, relief from expenses for connecting locations on the territory
of the Republic of Macedonia (services from telecommunications provider). The other benefit is
that the free capacity of the optical network is leased to telecom operators and other renters (VIP,
Blizoo, Neotel, MR Transport and others). Revenues realized on annually from the lease/rent of
part of the network capacity are in amount of 24,000,000.00 MKD's or approximately 400 000
Euros annually. Considering the initial investment of 1.79 Euro million and benefits of 400,000
Euros per year for 15 years, the EIRR of this investment is 21 percent and the NPV is 0.86 Euro
million. Table 7 presents the economic evaluation results of the overall project. The ex-post
overall project EIRR is 12.5 percent and the actual total NPV is 0.44 Euro million.

GENERAL INFORMATION

The overall objective of the Project was to facilitate the movement of trade between Republic of
Macedonia and neighboring countries in South East Europe, through the removal of selected
border-zone bottlenecks, and improving the efficiency and quality of road and rail services along
Trans-European Transport corridor X in R Macedonia and in particular roads component was to
support the following:

    x   Upgrading road corridor X section BCP of Tabanovce-Kumanovo to motorway
        standards;
    x   Upgrading Blace border crossing Point (BCP);
    x   Modernizing the Road Toll Collection System;
    x   Installation of modern telecommunication system on rail Corridor X;
    x   Project implementation support

The project closing date was extended twice (for a total of nine months) to allow completion of
all project activities and to enable the project to fully meet the development objective.

Restructuring was carried out at the Mid-Term Review, in order to reduce the scope of the Road
tolling component and to increase the percentage of the Bank’s financing from 78% to 100%. The
freed up resources were reallocated to Components 1 and 2. Also, the Resettlement Action Plan
was revised in order to take into consideration the Bank practice for the establishment of escrow
accounts/budget          lines         for         land        acquisition          compensation.

The Project’s road improvement component was focused on upgrading a 7.62 km road section
from BCP Tabanovce to Kumanovo to motorway standards. This section forms part of the Trans-
European Transport Corridor X.

Component 2 included the modernization of the border crossing point (BCP) Blace. This is a
passenger border crossing between Macedonia and Kosovo which until the project operated using
temporary facilities for border control, didn’t allow conditions for segregation of traffic and
sufficient control.

The modernization of the road toll collection system (component 3) originally was focused on
developing of specifications for the equipment that meets the system requirements, preparation
of the procurement documents for such modern electronic tolling equipment, based on open
competition requirements, as well as procurement of new equipment that allows for both cash and
non-cash (electronic) payments. Following the Government's decision to concession the toll
operation on Corridor X, it was agreed that road tolling under the project will focus on the
preparation of technical and functional specifications for the toll system. This was completed
satisfactory.
The fourth component included several activities in railways and Customs. The biggest one
referred to the introduction of a modern telecommunication system for railways along Corridor X.
During project life, activities to strengthen electronic clearance of Customs documents were
added.
Project implementation support originally included the goods and services required to support the
successful implementation of the Project: (i) audit services; (ii) project management, financial

                                               40
management, and procurement; (iii) technical services required for preparation and supervision of
Project components; (v) any training necessary for the completion of these tasks; and (vi)
incremental operating costs.


ACHIEVEMENT OF OBJECTIVES

COMPONENT 1 – Upgrading Section of Trans-European Transport Corridor X to Motorway
Standards

Civil works BCP Tabanovce-Kumanovo - The component includes construction of a new one-
directional carriageway with a width of 11meters, parallel to the existing road, separated from it
by a 4-meter median. The existing parallel road is now one-directional, and is widened from the
actual 7.5 meters to 11 meters in accordance with the prepared design for rehabilitation. The
investment included two sub-components: (i) construction of the additional lanes, and (ii)
supervision of construction. The upgrading to motorway standards required acquisition of
agricultural land that was successfully executed. No physical resettlement of people or demolition
of permanent structures occurred or was necessary.

During implementation, additional design elements have been prepared (e.g. design for
rehabilitation, design for two new interchanges, new road traffic design etc). All of these
optimized the impact of the modernization road as they allowed: improved accessibility of local
people to motorway and other roads, strengthened protection from flooding, EU compatible road
signs etc. Namely, during implementation, it was established that the Tabanovce Interchange will
have to be relocated from the village of Tabanovce to new chainage of 1+449 towards the border
crossing. The necessity was because of the village of the Tabanovce and customs that plan to
construct customs terminal that was to be connected to the new motorway. Another new
Interchange Recica was established and constructed on the location were the overpass was
foreseen in the original design. The reason is the connection of the village of Recica and Konjare
to the motorway E-75. Two new drainage systems have been constructed after the flood in 2009
that flooded all the household residents along the motorway. ASR had a working relationship
with the neighboring villages and tried to maximize the gains for the local population from the
construction of the motorway. For example, milled asphalt was all placed and compacted in the
village of Tabanovce, Gorno Kojnare and Kosturnik to improve the quality of their local roads.

The only remaining activity which is to be implemented by ASR with its national budget funds is
the implementation of noise mitigation measures. Initially, the design included the installation of
concrete noise barriers. However, those barriers do not exist anymore, so ASR did new noise
measurements on the motorway and protections for noise in the future. These suggested that other
measures can be considered. Therefore, ASR engaged a consultant to look into available noise
mitigation measures and organize an inclusive consultation process before deciding on the type of
noise mitigation measure. ASR has completed satisfactorily the consultations with the population
and should implement the measures during 2012.

The motorway is open to traffic and now provides a safer, more convenient and more cost-
effective transport connection. It is a very relevant connection, because it leads to the border
crossing with Serbia, and serves freight being transported to the markets in the EU. The operation
of Customs Clearance of Goods Section at the border crossing Tabanovce was started at the
beginning of 2012 practically opening a new possibility for the export-oriented sector. Until now,
the border crossing Tabanovce operated only for transit formalities and passenger traffic. The


                                                41
introduction of export clearance, functioning 24 hours, every day, including weekends and
holidays, free of terminal charge will ensure great advantages for the economic operators. The
continuous efforts of the Macedonian Government to improve the business climate, to provide for
faster and improved export procedures are defined in the Government Project “Regulatory
Guillotine?. This enables approximation towards the completion of the Regulatory Guillotine II
measure, stipulating for a possibility for 24/7 export clearance at least 1 border crossing with each
neighbouring country. This was one additional outcome of the new motorway.


COMPONENT 2 - Upgrading the passenger terminal at the Blace border crossing point with
Kosovo

The component upgrading of passenger border crossing point Blace to Kosovo includes the
removal of temporary facilities, replacing them with permanent control, inspection, and
administrative structures. The aim is to enlarge the capacity of the passenger border crossing by
increasing the facility from 2x2 to 2x3 lanes, adding a separate bus inspection lane for buses
entering Macedonia from Kosovo. The component is comprised of two sub-components:

    x   construction of necessary facilities for the customs, border police and other related
        agencies at the border, and
    x   supervision of the civil works.


The Contract for construction of Border Crossing Blace was signed in March, 2010 and was
awarded to GD Granit AD from Skopje, Macedonia for a value of 101,569,489.88 MKD or 1.7
mil. EUR equivalent. The Contract for supervision of the construction was signed in March, 2010
and was awarded to IRD Engineering & Euro Consult for a value of 5,374,021 MKD, or 0.09 mil.
EUR equivalent.

The construction currently is at 97.6 percent with works remaining on the old section of the
border crossing (asphalting of 200 m2) and installation of the new control cabins which should
take place immediately after the asphalting. Otherwise, the works completed have been
satisfactory. Customs now has a modern, well-functioning section of the border crossing, with a
new administrative building, bus control building, new furniture for border staff and also
restrooms for passengers.

It is notable that the working conditions are significantly improved. Newlly constructed
administrative buildings are with high quality, according to the European standards. The offices
are equipped with new furniture, new toilets, modern high quality heating system. Single window
system provides significantly better conditions for performing the everyday activities, for all
services acting at the border crossing point, such as Ministry of Interior, Phytosanitary Direcorate,
Food Agency, Post Office, assuring companies etc.

The control of the vehicles is facilitated, with possibility to carry out control in a separate
building with single purpose to conduct a detailed examination of all kinds of vehicles.

During the control of buses in the building, the passengers are allowed to be present during the
control, protected by the atmospheric conditions.




                                                 42
The additional contents of the building include modern offices for additional services in freight
forwarding and assurance matters.

At this moment only one side of the border crossing point is functional, but the flow of vehicles is
facilitated thanks to the improved working conditions, whish resulted in increased security and
reduced waiting time during the documents control, especially for intra-regional traffic in
morning and evening peak hours. The last measurements conducted in June, showed the
following results: the average time for processing at entry is 2.5 minutes (i.e., approx. 24
vehicles/hour), and on exit the time is 1.9minutes (i.e. approx. 31 vehicles per hour).

The Customs Administration also decided to install a new waste water treatment facility
(WWTF) for the BCP to further increase its capacity. This will be financed by the Customs
Admisntiration. The Customs Adminsitration still prepared technical specifications which were
considered appropriate by the Bank. The procurement for the WWTF was completed. The
WWTF is expected to be operational in autumn 2012.

COMPONENT 3 – Modernizing the Road Toll Collection System

The modernization of the road toll collection system (component 3) originally was focused on
preparing the specifications for the new equipment, as well as the procurement of modern
electronic tolling equipment, to be installed in each traffic lane at toll stations, linked with
automatic vehicle classification and traffic counting equipment, as well as the new equipment that
allows for both cash and non-cash (electronic) payments, in order to contribute in reduction of
leakages in toll revenue collection. During the period of Mid-term review of the Project, the
Government decided to concession the toll operation on Corridor X. It was agreed that project
funds for procurement of modern electronic tolling equipment can be reallocated. The road tolling
under the project focused only on technical and functional specifications for the toll system. This
was completed satisfactory, in 2008 by BCEOM as part of the Project.

COMPONENT 4 - Installation of Railways Communication System

TTFSE2 Project for modernization of border crossings and acceleration of the passengers and
goods flow is fully and very successfully completed within railways part. On the basis of the
requirements defined in the loan terms of reference was established a list of necessary means and
equipment procurements which were planned for realization of defined requirements.

The contents of this report are the use, justification of equipment and means that were purchased
under loan fourth component, i.e. in the part for railways.
• Short review of the Report for every sub-component of the 4-th component.
• Use of the equipment and means.

Key Project requirements in the part for railways:
Development component: The main project objective was to allow a faster flow of passengers and
goods at the border crossing points where Macedonian railways operate, to improve the
telecommunication network, to increase the productivity and efficiency of railway traffic in
relation with the other traffic stakeholders, to enhance operations services. The goal which was
set before the Project implementation beginning was completely realized.

Macedonian Railways Infrastructure has got a modern integrated telecommunication system. The
components making parts of this project are completely realized. Each component as a part of one
whole has contributed in completion of the integrated TC system.

                                                43
The Project structure was in compliance with the set terms of reference which explains the
planned requirements in details. The project consists of four independent sub-components.

The first sub-component is related to the purchase of passive equipment, fiber optic cable and
suspension equipment.

The second sub-component is related to purchase of active equipment and installation, multiplex
equipment.

The third sub-component is related to purchase of means for servicing and maintenance of TC
network, service vehicles, digger machine for ditches, measuring instruments.

The fourth sub-component is related to purchase of integrated financial software.
The component for purchase of equipment and systems was entirely performed in accordance
with the planned goal.

During the realization of the project, the program was extended by new equipment and systems
necessary for completion of TC system. The extensions were in function of upgrading of planned
means and systems and allowing of TC network resources use.

The results of all realized purchases in the component 4 are successful and over the expectations.
The future expectations are related to the upgrading and development of already installed systems,
software and means.

The results of certain purchases in this component make part of this Report and they are shown
by valid indicators. Sub-components which make part of Component 4 were timely performed
and according to the plan of purchases of MZI.

1.        The purchase of an optic cable and suspension equipment was in the framework of the
planned budget. The budget was enough to cover completely the current need. The purchased
optic cable in the length of 140 km with joints and suspension equipment was installed on the part
of Corridor 10 – border with Greece. Purchasing the passive part of the planned integrated TC
network has completed the connection of all border crossings (Tabanovce, Blace and Gevgelija).
All centers were also connected on Corridor 10, customs offices on the railway network and main
organization units. This sub-component has completed the physic optic network which total
length now is of 360 km. The connection of all points included in function of the traffic
organization ensures a possibility for a faster flow of information.
2.       The purchase of the multiplex equipment was realized in the framework of the planned
budget. This equipment is the active part of the integrated telecommunication optic network. The
equipment was installed and put into operation according to the planned dynamic of the project
realization. This optic network has enabled to ensure flow of every kind of information. This has
allowed fulfilling the main goal of this project part, i.e. providing network infrastructure for a
faster flow of any kind of information necessary for acceleration of the passengers and goods
flow.
3.       The purchase of means for integrated telecommunicion network maintenance such as
service vehicles, small digger machine for ditches and measuring instruments have allowed to
improve and enhance the Service for interventions. They ensure better workers mobility, more
quick reaction in the maintenance, access to the hard accessible places on the railway line. Their
enhancement contributes to the reduction of the interventions time and a smaller interruption in
the flow of information which have direct impact on the flow through the borders.

                                               44
4.      The purchase of integrated software for financial operations and human resources allows
a completion of the softwares implementation in MZI. The software for railway infrastructure
management system (RIMS), energy management information system (EMIS) and the other
software to be implemented shall computerize in whole the railways.

The benefits of component 4 in the part for railways and customs are attained. The network
connects all locations and offices through which are assured traffic procedures. All important
official places of the transport company are also connected. The integrated optic network allows
transmitting any type of software. The border stations are connected between themselves and the
network allows a quick transfer of all necessary data for traffic operations and other technological
operations. Through the integrated TC network, the transport company transmits data from border
stations to the Central station in Skopje. One of the goals was the implementation of interface
software needed for connection of two processing technological softwares of the Transport
Company and customs. But because of the non-realization of the customs part project this goal
was not fulfilled. Regardless of this, the goal of the integrated TC network is completely fulfilled.
Currently, through it the transfer of existing softwares is done, and in this manner was allowed
more quick and sure transmission. Indirectly this decreases the retention time of the trains at the
borders. Except for the goals set for the TTFSE2 Project the integrated TC network contributes in
completion of the requirements established in the RRP Projects, Railway Reforms Project.

This network allowed putting into operation the CTC system, the section of connecting of the
remote stations with the Centre in Skopje-Trubarevo. The system for IP telephony was upgraded
and MZI was covered by telephonic communication at all service places on corridor 10, including
also all borders. Connecting of all service places has allowed to be integrated and implemented all
softwares on whole territory. In this manner the IT system of Railways is integrated with the
central server and working stations in all remote service places.

The network provides a fully functional implementation of both softwares purchased through the
RRP-RIMS Project and the integrated financial software. Both softwares have central bases
installed in centre in Skopje. The communication with the working stations that are installed
throughout the territory of the Macedonian Railways network is online. This enables also to
rationalize the jobs, economical and efficient operation.

The integrated optic network enables a total electronic (digital) exchange of information on the
total Macedonian railways network. This leads to the quicker data exchange and decreasing the
formal procedures at the borders and customs terminals.

The velocity of the flow, the configuration of all local networks and installation in one central
network provide significant possibilities in the further use.
ITC network has provided the following benefits:

1.       Connection of all service places
2.       Connection with some customs offices
3.       Connection with foreign railways at border crossings (Kosovo, Greece)
4.       Quick flow of every kind of information (data, spoken information, video)
5.       Launching of initiative and implementation of common border stations of railway
administrations (Tabanovce common operating station between Serbia and Macedonia, the
establishment of common station Kosovo-Macedonia (General Jankovic) is in course, two optic
networks Kosovo-Macedonia are connected.
6.       The station of Tabanovce is common operating station for the two railway
administrations. The network connects the two railways, and the exchange of all data is

                                                 45
performed electronically. In this manner the time of formalities is maximum shortened from the
railway aspect.
7.       The establishment of same procedure of common operating station between Kosovo and
Macedonia is in course.
8.       In February 2012, the customs office 4 started working with unique code 1014 for
submission of documents, located at railway station Tovarna in Skopje. The customs office will
perform the customs duties in freight transportation, i.e. import-export customs clearing as well as
transit of goods transported by railways, and in this manner the procedures and competences
performed until now in customs office in Trubarevo 1030 will be in competence of the new
customs office Skopje 4.

The benefits of this solution are quick and efficient completion of the customs procedure because
the station Tovarna possesses ideal conditions for customs inspection of the goods transported by
railway and truck traffic, possesses crane for unloading of goods transported by containers,
warehouse, parking for more of 100 freight vehicles, ideal traffic solutions and it is located near
of the headquarters of Customs Skopje.

It is foreseen the new customs office to be in the future competent for an intermodal customs
supervision, that means performing the import-export procedures as well as transit operations in
railway freight and truck transportation with infrastructure solutions of customs terminal.

Development of Integrated Information System

This activity is financed with the reallocation of 50.000 Euro from the component 3, agreed
between the Bank and the Government in December 2010, following the signature of the LA
amendment signed on December 15th 2010, which provided funds for financing of this activity.

Contract was signed in April, 2011 and was awarded to SRC - Skоpje for a value of 3,074,355. 00
MKD or 0.05 mil. EUR equivalent.

The contract for the upgrade of the Integrated Information System (IIS) was successfully
completed (September 26, 2011) and the upgraded IIS is operational. The upgrade has: (i)
improved processing time, which currently stands at 2 minutes (earlier processing time was 7
minutes), (ii) improved administrative tax collection, (iii) improved operational effectiveness of
the customs administration, (iv) increased security of information managed through the system
and (v) increased transparency of this aspect of Customs operation. Together these improvements
lead to faster completion of customs procedures, better fiscal collection and also decreased
corruption possibilities, overall improving the conditions for doing cross-border trade in
Macedonia.

From a functionality point, some of the most important additions that were brought as part of this
project were: the electronic records register for classified cases, electronic management of
administrative taxes, solution for natural and legal person fines management and employment
lawsuits management.

The documentary database currently holds more than 450,000 documents and the system is used
by 1000 internal users and more than 300 external economic operators which are managed and
controlled by more than 170 configured workflow procedures. All of this suggests that valuable
improvements have been made to the system.

The relevance of this upgrade for the improved operational and administrative capacity was noted

                                                46
by the 2011 Progress Report of the European Commission published October 12, 2011, which
overall marked the continued progress in the customs area.


Development of application for processing of requests for inward processing

This activity is also financed with the reallocation of 50.000 Euro from the component 3,
provided with the amendment to the TTFSE 2 Project signed on December 15th 2010. Customs
started the preparation of the bid document in January 2011. Contract was signed in August, 2011
and was awarded to VISTA - Skopje for a value of 2,907,580.00 MKD or 0,05 million EUR
equivalent. The originally Contract Completion date is 15th March 2012. Due to the need for
additional time for achieving operational acceptance, the Contract was amended up to May 31st
2012.

The system is particularly beneficial to the textile and steel industry, as it introduced electronic
management of all inward processing activities. This includes automatic customs confirmation on
the quantities of exported finished goods against the imported materials used as input for export.
Processes which were carried out manually were completely paper-based and took days, are to be
completed paperless, within one working day. This not only improves the efficiency of the
customs processing, but also reduces corruption opportunities and increases accountability.

The sub-component - an interface with the MCA information systems. MCA and MZ
freight data sharing has speeded up the processing and electronic recording of freight
customs declarations, etc.

The elimination of freight train processing delays and achieving the scheduled 90 minutes for
freight train processing has been achieved.

The main benefit is the more efficient processing of international trade and transport
documentation, which enhances transparency of transactions and reduces duplications and
overlaps.

This reduces rail traffic congestion and increases competitiveness of rail freight transport. In
addition, by reducing congestion the Project created conducive conditions to attract rail cargo
traffic, which otherwise would be either foregone or directed to more expensive alternative
maritime or inland corridors. This transit traffic generates an economic surplus for the country
through increased year-round economic direct and indirect activity.


ASSESSMENT OF BANK AND BORROWER PERFORMANCE

The project has been implemented by a Project Coordination Unit (PCU), which formed part of
the Agency for State Roads (ASR). The Project Coordinator was the Director of the ASR, who
was also a member of the Project Steering Committee, established to facilitate coordination and
cooperation between the various agencies during implementation of the project. Vice Prime
minister and Minister of Finance chairs the Project Steering Committee, which also includes the
Minister of Transport and Communications, the Director General of ASR, the Director General of
the Public Enterprise for Housing (PEH), the Director General of MZ and the Director General of
the MCA, and a representative of the Ministry of Finance.


                                                47
The Agency for State Roads is an agency with experience in the implementation of projects and
had sole responsibility for coordinating the Project; two different Government agencies i.e.
Macedonian Customs Administration and Macedonian Railways were included in the
implementation of different components. Good cooperation within agencies, between various
agencies within the country, and cross-border agency cooperation, was essential for
accomplishing the objectives of improving trade and transport flows along main transport
corridors. Customs is the key agency for cargo processing and management of border crossing
facilities, many other stakeholders were involved, such as Border Police, Ministry of Transport,
phyto-sanitary inspection, etc. These agencies regularly met within the framework of EU
promoted Integrated Border Management as an independent State Commission for border
management.

The three agencies that implemented the Project are very appreciative of the help, work and
advice given by the Bank’s staff during the implementation of the project.

In the transport sector the Bank identified the most efficient way to facilitate the movement of
trade between the Borrower and neighboring countries in South East Europe, through the removal
of selected border-zone bottlenecks, and improving the efficiency and quality of road and rail
services along Trans-European Transport corridor X in Republic of Macedonia, improve the main
border crossing between Republic of Macedonia and Kosovo, support harmonization of rail
freight data requirements between railways and customs, and improve telecommunications
infrastructure to facilitate freight information flows and advance train information along rail
Corridor X.

 The contribution and work of the Task Managers and their supervision missions, have
contributed greatly to the final success and achievements of the project.




LESSONS LEARNED

In general it is important to strengthen public administration capacities at all levels in order to
ensure sustainability of the activities and enhance full ownership on behalf of the beneficiary
institutions through stronger participation along the project cycle.

The past experience implementing the World Bank projects has shown the need of:
   a) allocation of dedicated administrative staff engaged on permanent basis to work on the
       project, thus improving staff capacity and providing a sustainability of the project
       activities;
   b) well defined objectives and activities throughout the life cycle of the project;
   c) flexibility and readiness to adopt the project activities applying methodologies to deliver
       results in line with the latest development in the relevant field;
   d) coordination and cooperation with other ongoing or upcoming projects; and
   e) the involvement and commitment of high-level strategic decision making management
       defining the project, as well as permanent monitoring and follow-up of the project, are
       important and essential for success and sustainability of the project results.



                                                48
Strong commitment from senior management and various final beneficiaries remains crucial for
the overall implementation of the project activities.
