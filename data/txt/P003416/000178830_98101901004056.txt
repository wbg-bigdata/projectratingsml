I. ENERGY SECTOR I!
Introduction
1.01     China is well endowed in primary energy.  It is the fourth largest
producer of commercial energy after the United States, the Soviet Union and
Saudi Arabia. Output of commercial energy is one-fifth of US and one-third of
USSR. Coal and lignite reserves are estimated at over 600 billion tons.
Annual hydro potential is estimated at 1,900 billion kWh, against the present
hydro generation of 58 billion kWh and overall power generation potential of
300 billion kWh. Official estimates of oil and gas reserves are not
available. Unofficial estimates, however, place the recoverable reserves of
oil at 1.8-2.5 billion tons, and of natural gas, both associated and non-
associated, at about 130 billion cubic meters (equivalent to over 110 million
tons of oil). From the review of the sedimentary basins, the ultimate
recoverable reserves of oil are estimated to be in the range of 12 to 20
billion tons. In addition, the reserves of oil shales are reported to be of
the order of about 400 billion tons. For a number of reasons, including
logistics, substantial investment requirements and long gestation period
needed for developing coal and hydro potential, the relative share of coal and
hydro power in the overall energy balance is not anticipated to increase
significantly over the next ten years.
1.02     China's achievement in developing its energy resources over the last
three decades has been impressive. Production of coal has increased from
little over 60 million tons in 1952 to 620 million tons in 1981. During the
same period, power generating capacity increased from a little less than 2000
MW to 67,000 MW. Oil production increased from about 0.1 million tons in 1950
to 106 million tons by 1979. Output of oil fell marginally to about 101
million tons in 1981. This rapid pace of development has pushed China into
the rank of the third largest consumer of commercial energy in the world,
behind USA and the Soviet Union, but ahead of Japan.
1.03     China's global pre-eminence as a producer and consumer of commercial
energy notwithstanding, its consumption pattern is more analogous to a
developing country where a large proportion of the population continues to
rely upon non-commercial sources (plant residue and animal power) for meeting
its energy requirements. Consumption per capita is about 650 kilograms of
coal equivalent (kgce), which is slightly above the average for developing
countries (620 kgce). In fact, China's energy sector is a curious amalgam of
the traditional and the modern and of advanced technologies and inefficient
practices. The future prospects remain uncertain, and while the probability
for retaining self-sufficiency in energy remains high throughout the eighties,
it is doubtful if China would be able to sustain the rate of growth it
achieved over the last two decades. Major oilfields have peaked and

entered into a declining phase. No new discoveries have been made in a
magnitude to offset this decline. Rapid expansion of coal industry faces
intractable problems in terms of investment, location and transportation.
Remoteness of major hydro potential sites from the centers of consumption and
the long gestation period, precludes hydropower's share from increasing
significantly beyond its present level within the first half of the 1980's.

Resource Endowment
1.05     The major existing and potential sources of primary energy are
indicated below:
(a) Coal
1.06     Coal is China's traditional source of energy and at present caters to
nearly 70% of its demand for commercial energy. The output of raw coal in
1981 was about 620 million tons, a level surpassed only by USA and USSR. The
coal and lignite reserves are concentrated largely in the north and northeast,
and represent about 70% of the total recoverable reserves in China (600
billion tons). In terms of production also, the north and northeast account
for 70% of the total national output and the south, with production level of
15%, remains coal deficient. About 75% of coal production comes from large
mines with more than 0.6 million tons annual capacity. The small mines (1000-
100,000 tons annual capacity), over 20,000 in number, are rudimentary
underground operations and the productivity is extremely poor. The output of
the small mines goes essentially for meeting local commercial and domestic
needs. While there are some modern collieries in China, most of the mines are
only partly mechanized. Future plans call for increased mechanization in both
old end new mines, and for domestic manufacture of underground mining
equipment. The Government expects the output to reach 700 million tons by
1985. However, in increasing coal output, transport, essentially railroad
capacity, appears to be a major constraint.
(b) Power
1.07     China increased its generating capacity from little less than 2000 MW
in 1952 to over 67,000 MW by 1981 - an average growth rate of about 14% per
annum. Of this, 70% of the generating capacity is thermal (46,200 MW) and 30%
is hydro (21,000 MW). In 1980, 309 billion kWh of power was generated, of
which about 80% was thermal and the balance 20% hydro. China's hydro power
potential is among the largest in the world, and is estimated at 1900 billion
kWh per year against the present hydro generation of about 60 billion kWh. The
Chang Jiang (Yangtze River), which flows through the southwestern portion of
China and eastern Xizang (Tibet), holds the largest hydro potential. On
account of the terrain through which it flows, only limited efforts have been
made to develop this potential. Major hydropower development has, however,
taken place on the Huang He (Yellow River) and the Han Shiu (Han River) which
flow through northeastern part of China. Liujiaxia is the largest hydropower
station in China and is constructed in Gansu on the Huang He. It has a
designed capacity of 1,225 MW and is annually capable of delivering about 5.7
billion kWh. Danjiangkou is the second largest power station in China, is
located on HIan Shiu and has a generating capacity of 900 MW. This hydro
station meets the power requirements of the province of Hubei. Presently,
China has about eleven hydroelectric stations with a capacity of 290 MW or
greater. The other Chinese rivers which have major hydroelectric systems are
the Songhuajiang (590 MW), the Dadu River (508 MW), the Fuchun River and
tributaries (1330 MW) and the Yalu River (1100 MW).
1.08     Over the last decade, the mini hydrostations got a tremendous impetus
and grew from about 15,000 to about 90,000 in number. Typically, these
stations are about 50 kW in generating capacity, and are designed to meet the
needs of the rural areas. Besides providing power to the local communes,



- 5 -
reservoirs built for this purpose meet irrigation requirements, prevent floods
and are being used for pisciculture. The potential is indeed immense, and it
can be harnessed with local materials and the construction period is short.
However, seasonality appears to be a major constraint.
(c) Oil and Gas
1.09     Growth in the hydrocarbon sector, over the last two decades, has been
equally remarkable. While oil was discovered in China in 1897, annual oil
production up to 1950 was no more than 120,000 tons of which about 50,000 tons
was from oil shale. During the fifties, exploratory effort was confined to
northwest China which resulted in small discoveries. However, fromn 1957,
exploration was undertaken in the northeast-and northern China, leading to the
discovery of the 'super giant' oilfield in Daqing in 1959. This was followed
by discoveries in Shengli and Dagang in 1964. In 1965 petroleum production
reached 11.3 million tons and with that China became self-sufficient. During
the sixties, increase in oil production was relatively moderate; the major
spurt came in the seventies with production increasing from 30 millionl tons in
1970 to 106 million tons in 1979. This increase came largely from the
development of the Daqing oilfield, and to a lesser extent, from the
development of the Shengli and Renqiu oilfields.
1.10     Official estimates of oil and gas reserves are not available.  The
magnitude of China's proven and probable reserves is the subject of
considerable speculation and study outside the country. Varying estimates
relating to the proven recoverable reserves have been made by different
geologists/bodies; the opinion, however, is now converging to a range which
varies from 1.8 to 2.5 billion tons. Estimates regarding possible and
probable reserves, both offshore and onshore, are by nature somewhat
speculative. The current estimates range from 5-10 billion tons in the
onshore region and 4-8 billion tons in the offshore area.
1.11     Currently, the major non-associated gas fields are located in the
Sichuan Province and the recoverable reserves are estimated at 70 billion
cubic meters. In addition, there are some minor natural gas fields in the
northwestern part of China. Over and above this, the recoverable reserves of
associated gas are estimated at about 50 billion cubic meters. The cumulative
recoverable gas reserves are thus about 130 billion cubic meters, equivalent
to over 110 mi1li   tons of oil.  There is, however, a view that gas reserves
have not-been adequately explored and the presently known recoverable reserves
are a mere fraction of the full potential. According to some estimates, the
ultimate recoverable reserves of natural gas, both offshore and onshore, could
be as high as 3,000 billion cubic meters.
(d) Oil Shale
1.12     Reserves of oil shale in China are reported unofficially to be of the
order of 400 billion tons and may be much larger, since geological environment
is favorable for their formation in many of the sedimentary basins. Deposits
of 100 billion tons or more, containing 5-10 billion tons of oil, are reported
in Heilongjiang and Hebei. The grade of most of oil shales is fairly low
(less than 10%), but a few deposits have 10-20% of oil by weight. Before
1958, oil shale accounted for almost half of Chinese oil production, but the
proportion declined rapidly as normal crude oil production increased after the



-6 -
discovery of the Daqing oilfield.  Currently, from the Liaoning and Guangdong
mines, about 300,000 tons of shale oil is being produced.
(e) Geothermal
1.13     China's geological conditions are such as to give rise to abundant
geothermal phenomena, especially in the Tibetan Plateau. Most occurrences
seem to be relatively low temperature ground water suitable for space heating;
high temperature manifestation suitable for power generation seems to be more
frequent in the mountainous southwestern part of the country, such as Yunnan
Province and Xizang Autonomous Region (Tibet). The Ministry of Geology, which
has the responsibility for developing geothermal resources, has identified and
developed two projects. The first is a geothermal power station in the
Yangbajain geothermal field of Xizang, some 50 km from Lhasa and the other is
an urban heating system developed in the southeastern part of Beijing.
Geothermal energy has not been developed to a significant extent in China.
Furthermore, its role is likely to be limited to urban heating systems in the
colder regions of the country and possibly to power generation in Xizang.
(f) Non-commercial Energy
1.14     Although no data base exists for quantifying the extent of non-
commercial energy used in China, it is apparent that this form of energy
constitutes a significant proportion of the total energy used, especially in
the rural areas. Fuel wood from loppings and grass, animal and crop residue,
and especially rice straw, are the principal sources of non-commercial
energy. Unofficial estimate places the energy extracted from these sources at
250 million tons of coal equivalent or about one-third of the total energy
used. If this estimate is correct, then the traditional fuels play a smaller
role in China than in most other countries with similar per capita levels.
This is partially explained by a high population density and low availability
of forest resources.
1.15     For maximizing the benefits from non-commercial sources of energy,
China has pioneered and is now the leader in producing biogas. Biogas, which
contains methane up to 65%, is produced by the fermentation of animal and
human waste, vegetation, household garbage and waste water. Originating in
the Province of Sichuan, biogas digesters are now all over China with the
exception of the colder regions of the country, and currently exceed 6 million
in number. A typical 10 m3 digester, costs about 50 Yuans (US$30), and can
meet the composite energy needs of a family of five. In addition to the
ecological benefits, through lower deforestation and the saving of fossil
fuels, biogas digesters produce organic fertilizer, an essential ingredient
for Chinese agriculture.
Distribution of Energy Resources
1.16     China's energy resources are not evenly distributed.  The northeast
and the north, with nearly 30% of China's population and more than 45% of the
gross industrial output, have as much as 75% of the known commercial energy in
terms of coal and oil. These reserves currently account for the bulk of the
counrry's production and are being extracted at a relatively fast pace. The
east, with one-fifth of the total population and 30% of the industrial output,
is almost devoid of any energy resource. The central south and southwest
China, except for hydropower potential, is equally bereft of other forms of



energy. It is the northwest China, with possibly half of China's probable
reserves of coal and oil, and with major hydro potential in Xizang, which
would need to be developed for meeting China's growing energy needs. Some of
these areas, however, have a hostile environment, are inaccessible and very
sparsely populated and, therefore, developing energy resources here would
neither be cheap nor quick. It is for this reason that China is increasingly
considering its oil potential in the offshore area, especially in the
southeastern continental shelf.
Scale of Development
1.17     One of the basic tenets of Chinese developmental philosophy has been
going small on a big scale. This guiding principle has had a significant
impact on its energy policy and manifested itself in a large number of small
coal mines, about 90,000 mini hydropower plants, and innumerable biogas
units. True, the productivity of the small coal mines is low and the working
environment is hazardous, and the cost of power generation in mini hydro
plants is generally higher than in major hydropower stations. Yet, these
units rely on local initiatives, skills, materials and capital, and have been
brought onstream with commendable speed. Most of the small coal mines have
been developed in the energy deficient southern China and now provide the much
needed fuel for local industries and households. Similarly mini hydro
stations have a significant impact on the local economy by providing flood
control, irrigation, and power, without creating a draft on the major power
stations and on the under-developed transmission system. These stations have
made rural electrification possible on an extensive scale.
1.18     However, this policy has not been an unqualified success.  Its
indiscriminate application to all facets of industrial activity spawned a
large number of small scale refineries, fertilizer units, cement, and iron and
steel plants. This led to dissipation of resources where economies of scale
were given up in deference to a developmental philosophy. 'Teakettle' refine-
ries are inefficient and make product standardization impossible. Backyard
fertilizer plants for synthesis of ammonia, besides requiring investment per
unit of nutrient output which is two to three times higher than modern plants,
produce product which is unstable and relatively ineffective in use. Small
scale iron and steel works are equally inefficient in terms of capital use and
the quality of product. This is not to suggest that this policy should be
abandoned; it is merely to argue for a more rigorous economic scrutiny.
Efficiency of Energy UJse
1.19     From the limited data available, it appears that China's level of
commercial energy consumption is very high in relation to its economic
activity. Although global comparisons of commercial energy consumption per
unit of GDP show China with an energy intensity level more than double that of
most other developing countries and industrialized market economies, this is a
very crude index of energy efficiency, and is subject to considerable
variation due to differences in economic structure (China has a relatively
larger heavy industrial sector than many other countries) and problems
associated with the valuation of output. Nevertheless, micro-level energy
intensity comparisons on a physical basis, particularly in industry, indicate
substantial potential for improvement in industrial energy efficiency in
China. For example, in the steel industry, China's largest industrial energy
consumer (12% of total commercial energy), energy consumption per ton of crude



- 8 -
steel, even in large integrated plants, is approximately double the level
achieved in best international practice, and energy consumption per ton in the
small and medium plants is about 25% higher than in the larger plants. In the
nitrogenous fertilizer industry, average energy consumption per ton of ammonia
is roughly double that of best international practice, due partly to the
outmoded technology used in these smaller plants, and to different raw
materials. The smaller scale plants, which produce over half the ammonia,
have about one-half the energy efficiency of the newer larger plants in
China. The problem of small inefficient plants is also true in the brick
industry. Smaller brick plants, which produce 2/3 of the country's bricks,
consume 50% more energy per ton of bricks than the larger plants.
1.20     The problem of energy efficiency in China is, therefore, due not only
to certain managerial/operational inefficiencies, which might be corrected in
the relatively short term with little or no investment, but is also related to
the use of older-fashioned technology, inadequate facilities to capture waste
heat, the scale of industrial plants, and the raw materials used. Many of
these problems will take longer to solve, and require substantial capital
investment and some industrial restructuring. The Government is well aware of
and highly concerned about these problems, and is promulgating a number of
policy measures to address them, while according energy conservation equal
priority with increasing energy production. These measures include plans to
establish a number of energy conservation technical assistance centers to
assist industrial enterprises in evaluating and improving their energy
efficiency, enterprise-level quota systems with accompanying bonus and pricing
systems for energy conservation below or above quota, industrial restructuring
(including decreased relative emphasis on heavy industry), and increased
taxation on petroleum fuels to encourage both conservation and fuel
substitution. These measures appear to have had some success and the
Government estimates that about 6 million tons of coal equivalent were saved
in 1981.
II. OIL AND GAS SECTOR
Background
2.01     China is perhaps the oldest user of hydrocarbons; the Zulujing field
was developed over 2000 years ago, producing gas through bamboo pipes and oil
from dug pits. In the modern times, the first oilfield was discovered in 1897
at Dushanzi in the Junggar basin, followed by another discovery in 1907 at
Yanchang in the Shaanxi Province. Over the next forty years, exploratory
efforts were minimal, relied largely on the initiative of the private
companies and the total number of wells drilled was less than 170. This
drilling activity led to the discovery of three oil and two gas fields. The
size of the discoveries and the production level was modest and an important
constituent of the output was shale oil. Production averaged about 70,000
tons per year and reached 120,000 tons by 1950. Of this, shale oil accounted
for 50,000 tons.
2.02     It was only after 1950 that a concerted effort was made to increase
oil production. The older oilfields (Jiuquan, Yanchang and Dushanzi) were
expanded to increase oil production. Separately, exploratory effort was



stepped up in northwest China leading to the discovery of the Karamay oilfield
in the Xinjiang Autonomous Region. The scale and the size of the discoveries
were small, and China had to rely on imported oil to meet its requirements.
As of 1957, the focus of exploration shifted to the north and northeast China
leading to the discovery of the super giant oilfield in the Songliao basin in
1959. Called 'the great celebration', the Daqing oilfield, since its
discovery, has accounted for more than 50% of China's total oil production.
Petroleum Geology
2.03     The petroleum geology of China is unusual in that most of the known
petroleum accumulations are found in the sedimentary rocks of lacustrine
rather than marine origin, laid down in ancient lakes or inland seas which
occupied depressions in the Chinese landmass. These sediments now underlie
large areas of the North China Plain and the Xinjiang Autonomous Region in the
northwest. Oil and gas were formed in rocks of Mesozoic and earlier Tertiary
age and accumulated in sand beds intercolated with the shaly source rocks.
The reservoirs are block faulted quite intensely and their origin tend to be
thin and poorly sorted, but so numerous that the aggregate oil bearing
thickness in the section is appreciable. Nine petroliferous basins have been
identified onshore China; the Songliao and the North China Plain basins in the
north and northeast China, Sichuan and Guangxi basins in southern China,
Shaanxi and Qin-Chuan basins in central China and the Qaidam, Tarim and
Junggar basins in the northwest China. Presently the Songliao and the North
China Plain basins are the most prolific producers of oil, accounting for more
than 90% of its production; but the basins in the remote and inhospitable
northwest are estimated to contain the largest oil potential. Substantial oil
accumulations have been proved in China and an aggregate daily production
level of 2 million barrels places China among the largest oil producing
countries of the world.
Institutions
2.04     The Ministry of Petroleum Industry (MOPI) oversees all aspects of oil
and natural gas activities which include policy making and overall planning,
exploration, production, distribution, transportation, research/design and
training. Created as a Bureau in the Ministry of Fuel Industry in October,
1949, it became a full ministry in 1955 and oversaw the opening of the Daqing
oilfield in 1959 and the various discoveries thereafter. In 1970 it was
merged with the Ministry of Coal and the Ministry of Chemical Industry. In
1978, the ministries were split and MOPI once again became an independent
entity. The organization chart of MOPI is in annex 2.01. The petroleum
industry in China has been in a state of continuous change; this has blurred
the lines of responsibility and created its own anomalies. The Ministry of
Geology (MOG), in addition to being in charge of petroleum related geological
work, separately and independently undertakes offshore exploration. Export of
oil and procurement of foreign technology and equipment relating to the oil
industry is the responsibility of several corporations under the charge of the
Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade. Similarly, fragmentation of
responsibility exists in refining; some refineries are managed by MOPI while
others are managed by the Ministry of Chemical Industry. There is also a
considerable overlap in technical training and research; its administrative
responsibility is shared/divided betweeen MOPI, Ministry of Education-and the
Chinese Academy of Sciences.



- 10 -
2.05     For securing foreign technology and undertaking external liason, the
Petroleum Corporation of the People's Republic of China (PCPRC) was created in
1977. The principal objective of PCPRC and its affiliate, the China Oil and
Natural Gas Exploration and Development Corporation (CONGEDC), was to enter
into agreements with foreign oil companies, especially in regard to offshore
geophysical and seismic work. As of February 16, 1982, the China National
Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) was created. This Corporation will take over
all the offshore functions and contractual rights and obligations of PCPRC and
CONGEDC. CNOOC will be responsible for inviting and evaluating bids and
entering into offshore petroleum agreements with foreign oil companies. For
implementing petroleum contracts and contracts for the construction of
offshore installation and facilities, CNOOC will set up regional subsidiary
corporations, namely, the Bohai Bay Oil Company, the South Yellow Sea Oil
Company, the Eastern South China Sea Oil Company and the Western South China
Sea Oil Company. In addition, CNOOC is considering establishing other
specialized companies.
Exploration Policy
(a) Onshore.
2.06     In exploration, as in other sectors, China, till the late seventies,
followed the policy of total self reliance and met with remarkable success.
Exploration is done by about 300 seismic crews and 500 drilling rigs, which
annually drill 2000 to 3000 wells. The rate of discovery has, however, been
declining (Renqiu was the last major discovery) and, faced with the prospect
of falling oil production, China has modulated its exploration policy.
Firstly, it proposes to undertake detailed seismic survey around existing
oilfields. This will help identify peripheral sands which could partially
offset the anticipated decline.   Secondly, it proposes to shift the focus of
exploration from north and northeast to Tarim, Qaidam, Junggar and Ordos
basins in the north and northwest. This shift will not be easy; all these
basins are located in the remote northwestern China, are only tenuously linked
with the rest of the country, have extremely hostile weather and difficult
drilling conditions. Pay zones are at considerable depths (5,000 to 9,000
meters) and the formation pressure and temperature is high. Developing this
area would therefore require a quantum jump both in investment and
technology. Thirdly, and recognizing the above, China has secured, on a
limited scale, assistance of foreign companies for undertaking seismic surveys
and exploratory drilling in specially difficult areas. As these basins are
estimated to hold about 50% of China's onshore recoverable reserves, GOC
intends, over the next five years, to concentrate its exploratory efforts in
this area. Finally, China is seriously considering inviting foreign oil
companies to participate in exploration and production, especially in these
difficult areas.
(b) Offshore
2.07     Prior to 1979, China had on its own undertaken seismic work and
developed offshore structures in the Bohai area, and in doing so recognized
the limitation of its offshore technology. Thereafter, in a major policy
change, China sought the active cooperation of foreign oil companies in
identifying and developing its offshore structures. Forty-eight foreign oil
companies, from 12 countries, were invited to undertake geophysical and
seismic work over 420,000 square kilometers of China's offshore sedimentary



- 11 -
basins. These surveys identified six prospective basins, namely, the Bohai,
the South Yellow Sea, the East China Sea, the Pearl River, the Southwest
Hainan Islands, and the Tonkin Bay basins. More than 475 prospective oil
structures have been identified in these basins. Present evidence indicates
that the Zhujiang (Pearl River) estuary is the most prospective.
2.08     In order to enable the participation of foreign oil companies in
exploring its offshore basins, GOC on January 30, 1982, promulgated
"Regulations on the Exploitation of Offshore Petroleum Resources in
Cooperation with Foreign Enterprises." These regulations enable GOC to enter
into petroleum contract with foreign oil companies whereunder and in terms of
the contract, these companies will bear the cost of all exploration investment
and accompanying risks. Once a commercial oil and/or gas field is discovered,
both the foreign contractor and the CNOOC will invest jointly in its
development. Whereas initially the foreign contractor will be the operator
responsible for developing and operating the field, under these regulations,
CNOOC has the right to take over as the operator whenever it deems fit. The
foreign contracting party may recover its investment and expenses and receive
remunerations out of the petroleum produced according to the provisions of the
petroleum contract. Further, the foreign contracting parties are at liberty
to deliver abroad their share of petroleum which is produced under this
agreement. The first round of bidding will take place in two phases. The
first phase relates to the northern part of the South Yellow Sea, and the
Zhujiang estuary in the South China Sea; the second phase concerns the
southern part of the South Yellow Sea, the Beibu Wan basin in the South China
Sea and the Yinggehai basin. The total area offered is about 150,000 square
kilometers. Bids for the first round were invited from foreign oil companies
on February 16, 1982, and for the second phase in April 1982. Considerable
interest has been evinced by foreign oil companies to these offerings.
Hydrocarbon Bearing Structures
Onshore
2.09     The oil and gas bearing structures are spread out over the entire
China land mass and can be split up geographically into six regions. Oil
production from each region along with the salient features of important
oilfields are discussed.
Northeast China
2.10     This region contains the prolific Songliao basin with the oilfields
of Daqing, Liaohe, Banshan and Fuyu. These oilfields account for about 60% of
China's current oil production.
2.11     Daging Oilfield.  This oilfield is situated in the central portion of
the Songliao basin, which is a large Mesozoic/Cenozoic inland sedimentary
basin covering approximately 25,000 square km. The Daqing oilfield measures
140 km in the north-south direction and about 15-30 km in the east-west
direction. The oil reservoir lies at 700-1200 meters below the surface.
Throughout its history, oil has been produced using water flood methods, the
field has now reached its maturity, oil production is declining while water
injected in the reservoirs is increasing. Infill drilling, producing new
reservoirs and enhanced oil recovery methods can be used to partially offset
the decline.



- 12 -
North China
2.12     This region contains Dagang oilfield in the Bohai basin and the
Renqiu oilfield in the Baoding basin. In addition, recent discoveries have
been made in Nei-Monggol, which is considered to be an extension of the
Songliao basin.
2.13     Renqiu Oilfield.  Located in Hebei Province, Renqiu is the first
discovery of a Precambrian reservoir in China. Rock characteristics make for
irregular porosity and varying oil output. Over the last two years the output
from this field has declined sharply (30%), from 16 million tons to about 12
million tons. However, new wells are being drilled at Renqiu; they tend to be
prolific and may, therefore, offset the decline partially and add to the
output.
2.14     Dagang Oilfield.  This field is entirely Tertiary and consists of
about 13 oil sands, totalling 37 meters of net pay. It is again a highly
faulted and a fractured structure, making the development and the production
from the field complex and unpredictable. The pay zones are between 2000 -
3000 meters in depth. The oil bearing strata appears and disappears
irregularly and the output at producing wells often fluctuates widely. The
oil is relatively light (34o API) and is reported to be sulphur free.
Eastern China
2.15     Shengli is the only major oilfield in this region.  This field, which
comprises about 40 small fields, totalling about 600 km2, is scattered on both
sides of the Huang He near the Bohai basin. This oilfield was discovered in
1962, production is from Miocene-Pliocene and Upper Tertiary strata, where a
wide variety of stratigraphic traps are situated. Oil sands are found in
small reservoirs, spread out in unpredictable patterns over a widely scattered
area. Underground permeability and pressure conditions vary, warranting water
injection in most of the cases. The quality of oil produced from this field
is of poor quality, having a gravity of 22o API, with fuel oil and other heavy
ends accounting for 75% of the product yield. Recently another discovery has
been made in Chezhen in the Shandong province. Size of this discovery is to
be determined.
Central-South China
2.16     Major production from this region comes from two new discoveries,
namely, the Nanyang field and the Zhongyuan field, both located in the
province of Henan.  The Nanyang field is reported to be producing about one
million tons of oil per annum. The Zhongyuan oil basin lies about 500 km
south of Beijing in the basin of the Huang He. Exploration in this area
started in 1977 and has led to the discovery of six small oilfields, namely,
Wenliu, Pucheng, Wenmingzhai, Weicheng, Guoyunji and Qiaokou. Since its
discovery, 1900 line kilometers of seismic survey have been done and 280 wells
have been drilled. The current production level-in these oilfields is 2.1
million tons per annum.



- 13 -
Northwest China
2.17     This area was the scene of the country's first commercial discovery
at Dushanzi in 1897, an oilfield which still produces 0.5 million tons. In
the same basin (Junggar), the Karamay oilfield was developed in the early
fifties and continues to produce about 3.5 million tons per annum. The Lenghu
oilfield in the Qinghai Province and the Yumen and Jiuquan oilfield in the
Gansu province are the other oilfields in this region. While cumulatively the
northwest region produces about 6 million tons of oil, it has basins which are
considered to hold the largest petroleum potential. Of special significance
is the Tarim basin where three important discoveries are reported to have been
made. Similarly, the Qaidam basin in northwestern Qinghai and the Ordos basin
in the Shaanxi Province are considered extremely prospective. Taking into
account the potential of this area and the difficulties involved in drilling,
MOPI has entered into service contracts with a number of foreign companies to
undertake seismic work, data processing and exploratory drilling.
Southwest China
2.18     The Sichuan basin is the only hydrocarbon bearing structure
discovered in this region. Natural gas has been produced from gas fields in
this structure for over a hundred years. The oil production is nominal and
does not exceed 0.1 million tons.
Offshore
2.19     Currently the Bohai gulf is the only source of offshore oil in
China. This gulf is relatively sheltered with a maximum water depth of 60
meters; it has two producing oilfields; namely, Heise and Chengbei. These
structures were discovered in 1970 and 1973. Over 130 wells have been drilled
in the Heise, but only six are currently producing. Eighteen wells are
producing in the Chengbei oilfield and cumulative oil production from the
offshore areas is less than half million tons per annum.
Current and Anticipated Level of Oil Production
2.20     The table below indicates the crude oil production by region and
major fields.

2.21     Over the last one year oil output has fallen by about 5%.  However,
of greater significance is the fact that the major oilfields, which together
account for 90% of China's oil production, have peaked; water cut (proportion
of water to oil produced) is increasing exponentially; and consequently
decline production has set in. With no major discovery to offset this fall,
China would need to rely increasingly on infill drilling, enhanced oil
recovery (EOR) methods, exploring for and developing peripheral reservoirs and
rapidly developing small discoveries. MOPI has initiated action in these
areas and efforts are under way for expanding oilfields such as Fuyu, Liaohe,
Karamay, Zhongyuan, Daqing (Gaotaizi reservoir) etc. In view of these
efforts, it is estimated that China will be able to temporarily stem the
decline and oil output up to 1985 may be in the range of 100-95 million tons.
2.22     The prognosis between 1985 and 1990 is less encouraging.  By this
time, oil output from Daqing, Shengli, Renqiu and Dagang would be declining at
a rapid pace. Furthermore, while prospects for offshore discoveries are rated
as very good, oil from the offshore areas is unlikely to augment China's oil

production significantly prior to 1990. Similarly, even if major discoveries
are made in the northwest, intractable logistics make the field development
and oil transportation an extremely complex and time consuming proposition.
Thus, between 1985 and 1990 there is a distinct possibility of oil production
falling to 90 million tons. Prospects beyond 1990 depend upon the success
attending the current initiative to develop offshore structure with the
assistance of foreign oil companies.
Quality of Crude Oil
2.23     Almost all Chinese crude oil has a high wax content and a high pour
point, so that it is solid at ambient temperatures most of the year. These
characteristics lead to severe problems in transportation and refining.
Transportation
2.24     Oil and petroleum products are transported by a variety of modes,
including pipelines, waterways, railways and road transport. The first crude
oil pipeline was built in 1970. Two major pipelines link the Daqing oilfield
with the Qinhuangdao refinery and the Dalian port. From this port the oil is
either exported or transported to other provinces. Another major pipeline
network links Dagang, Shengli, Renqiu and the Zhongyuan oilfields with the
Nanjing city. Currently, the crude oil pipeline network extends over 70,000
kilometers and the natural gas pipeline over 2,500 kilometers. Some 64% of
the crude oil is transported by pipelines, 26% by waterways and the balance by
railways. Presently there are no product pipelines and the petroleum products
are moved largely by roads, water ways and railways. MOPI is, however,
considering plans to build multiproduct pipelines.  All pipeline networks,
outside the oil/gas fields, are built, operated and maintained by the Pipeline
Administrative Bureau which is answerable to MOPI.
Refineries
2.25     The total refining capacity in China is 94 million tons, although
throughput in 1981 was limited to 73 million tons. Refining capacities vary
significantly - from 6 million tons per annum (MTPA) in Daqing and Beijing, to
5 MTPA in Nanjing, Shanghai, Shengli, Maoming and to a host of teakettle
refineries of less than 0.5 MTPA capacity. The main refinery products are
fuel oil (41%) diesel oil (27%), gasoline (16%) and kerosene (6%). In
addition, they produce industrial solvents and chemical feedstocks. The
refineries located in the oilfields or those undertaking only the refining of
crude oil are under the admininstrative control of MOPI. However, refineries
which also produce petrochemicals or undertake catalytic or hydro cracking are
under the Ministry of Chemical Industry. Overall refinery product yield is
indicated below:

Consumption Pattern
2.26     Rising oil production led to an increased role of hydrocarbons in the
Chinese economy. Coal has been the traditional source of commercial energy
supplying 90% of total energy as recently as 1965. The relative share of oil
and natural gas increased from about 2% in 1965 to 22.5% in 1981, with coal
(72.5%) and hydro (5%) providing the balance. The major consumer of oil is
the industry and commerce sector (43%) followed by transport (25%) and power
(20%). Similarly, natural gas is used by industry to the extent of 88% and
the balance by power. Household consumption for illumination, heating and
transportation is minimal and accounts for less than 2%. An unusual feature
in the consumption pattern is the direct use of crude, to the extent of 8
million tons, as fuel oil. Non availability of refining facilities close to
the producing field, transportation constraints and poor quality of crude, in
part explain this wasteful practice.
2.27     While oil production during the last 16 years grew at about 15% per
annum, consumption has kept pace. The table below indicates the overall
production, consumption and export levels.

2.28     Consumption has been growing at an annual rate of about 13%.
However, faced with a situation of falling oil and gas production, efforts are
being made to decelerate the growth; as a matter of fact consumption in 1981
is reported to be about 82 million tons against the peak of 90 million tons
attained in 1978. However, it is moot if further reduction in consumption can



- 17 -
be secured without adversely affecting the rate of growth. True there is
considerable wastage of energy and the scope for replacing oil by coal is
substantial. However, bringing this about is not going to be easy or quick.
Replacement of oil by coal would require substantial investment in terms of
transportation and extensive retrofitting. Similarly, once a production mode
has been determined, the energy efficiency factor is locked in and major
improvement in energy use cannot be secured without discarding the
investment.
2.29     Forecasts relating to future demand of petroleum products are not
available. Further, in the absence of detailed macroeconomic and sectoral
data, it is not possible to make any scientific forecast. However, working on
the growth rates assumed by the Bank's 1980 Economic Mission under the
scenario of moderate growth and moderate saving,1/ but applying them to the
reduced consumption base for 1981, the demand for petroleum products in 1985
is estimated to be about 92 million tons. Implications of such a scenario are
fairly grave. China has so far been able to maintain the export level; in
fact stepped it up even in a situation of declining production. In 1980
China's earnings from the export of oil are estimated at $4.75 billion and
represented 26.5% of its total foreign exchange earnings. Consumption level
of 92 million tons would imply that as of 1985 oil would cease to be a
significant source of foreign exchange earnings.
Natural Gas
2.30     China produces gas in significant quantities; in 1981 production of
gas (associated and non-associated) amounted to 12.5 billion cubic meters,
equivalent to about 10.5 million tons of oil. Of this, gas produced in
association with oil amounted to 6.2 billion cubic meters. The balance of 6.3
billion cubic meters, is non-associated gas, which is produced essentially in
the Sichuan Province, although marginal quantities are also being produced in
the Qaidam basin in the northwest. The gas industry is not new to Sichuan as
the current gas fields were discovered and developed over hundred years ago.
There are more than 200 gas bearing structures in the Sichuan Province and the
current production is around 5.6 billion cubic meters per annum. Weiyuan is
the largest gas field in Sichuan, producing about a billion cubic meters a
year, followed by Wulonghou, Shiyougou, Zigong, etc. The table below
indicates the production of gas by region.

2.31     Presently about 30% of the natural gas is used for fertilizers, about
10% for petrochemicals and synthetic fibers and the balance of 60% is used as
fuel, of which about 12% was used for thermal power plants. Non-associated
gas fields in the Sichuan Province, which have been producing for over 100
years, have now entered a declining phase. Similarly, with the decline in oil
production in the Daqing, Shengli and Dagang oilfields, production of
associated gas would also decline. As a matter of fact, gas production in
1981 in relation to 1980, registered a decline of about 13%, equivalent to 1.8
million tons of oil. Fall in gas production would inevitably stimulate demand
for liquid hydrocarbons. It is, therefore, necessary that efforts are
initiated to explore for and develop non-associated gas prospects.
Prices
2.32     Prices of petroleum products, like other essential commodities in
China, are fixed by the National Price Administrative Bureau. This Bureau

functions as an independent entity, and works under the supervision and
guidance of the State Council. The oilfields sell crude oil to the refineries
at a well-head price of Y100 ($53) per ton, with the exception of northwest
China and Zhongyuan oilfield (a new field discovered in 1977) which sell crude
at Y130 ($68) per ton. Refineries in turn sell petroleum products to the
Ministry of Commerce which is responsible for marketing the products. There
is a price differential at every point, with the oilfields, the refineries,
and the Ministry of Commerce, acting as profit centers for the State. The
table below indicates the price of various petroleum products, ex-refinery and
at the pump head.

2.33     The average price of the reconstituted barrel works out to Y55 ($29),
which is in line with the international price. Currently, the Pricing Bureau
is increasing the price of crude oil sold to the refineries from Y100 (and
Y130 in some cases) per ton to Y175 per ton, it is not clear that this
increase would be reflected in the end prices. The maximum it may, therefore,
achieve is redistribute surplus from the refineries/Commerce Ministry to
MOPI. Until recently, there did not appear to be financial incentives in
China to switch from oil to coal, since fuel oil in terms of calorific value,
is cheaper than coal. During the past two years, the Government has sought to
encourage energy conservation and substitution of coal for oil through various
administrative means and financial incentives (see para. 1.20). Starting from
September 1982, a special tax of Y70/ton is levied on crude and fuel oil which
is being burnt as fuel. In effect, the retail prices of petroleum fuel to end
consumers would amount to Y170 and Y155 per ton of crude and fuel oil
respectively. This is a significant step in the direction towards ensuring
that price incentives reinforce rather than contradict administrative
regulations, which will be increasingly important as decision-making is
decentralized. This aspect would be taken up in the Bank's overall economic
dialogue with MOPI.

Planning and Investment
2.34     The major economic instrument is the annual plan, which consists of
several parts, including a production plan, a material allocation plan, a
labour plan, etc. The core of this document is a set of interlocking material
balance matrices, specifying sources (production, import, drawdown on
inventory, etc.) and uses (intermediate input, investment, consumption,
exports, etc.). The State Planning Commission (SPC) prepares the plan, with
overall responsibility for supervision resting primarily with the State
Economic Commission. MOPI, like other line ministries, operates under the
overall supervision of these commisions. While SPC is the final arbiter for
the annual plan, its finalization is a result of a series of iterative
consultations between SPC, MOPI and its constituent units. In the absence of
long term planning, there is an understandable preoccupation with the current
instead of the future, a preference for short-run expedients over measures
which aim at fostering productivity over the long run. This has at times led
to uneconomic extraction, rapidly rising production reserve ratio and
relatively inadequate investment in exploration or new technology.
2.35     The average investment in the oil and gas sector over the last five
years has been about Y2.8 billion ($1.5 billion). In the absence of a long
term plan, the future investment program for the sector is uncertain. The
annual plan for 1982 is being assumed to remain at the same level as 1981.
Even during the past, investment has varied from year to year and the
investment in 1978 was 50% higher than 1981 or what is programmed for the
current year. The major share of investment (50%) has gone into exploration,
with oilfield development securing only 30%. The present investment
development works out to $0.6 per barrel - a figure which is not only
indicative of relatively low cost levels obtaining in China, but more
importantly, could be symptomatic of inadequate investment being made in the
oil industry. So as to stem the anticipated decline in oil production, China
would need to step up investment substantially; for producing oil from peaking
fields, development of peripheral sands and exploration in the northwestern
part, would require outlays which are quantitatively and qualitatively
higher. Offshore development would create a further draft on resources, as
under the proposed participation agreement; even though the cost of
exploration is to be borne by the foreign oil companies, GOC would share the
development costs to the extent of 51%. The table below indicates the
investment made in exploration, development and refining during the last five
years.

Role of the Bank
2.36     China has so far been extremely successful in developing its oil
resources. However, its major oilfields, which together account for 90% of
its oil production, have peaked. Inspite of relatively high outlays for
exploration, Renqiu was the last major oil discovery. From available evidence
it is clear that China at least in the medium term faces the prospect of
declining oil production. There are also various constraints, including
transportation bottlenecks, to the rate at which coal supply can be
expanded. The Government's energy strategy involves addressing the problem of
moderating energy demand as well as expanding supply. Various measures to
control demand are being implemented in the short term, including quota
systems, technical assistance to enterprises, and some industrial
restructuring (para. 1.20). Sector strategy over the longer term would
require China taking steps to increase its exploratory efforts, especially in
the offshore areas where private industry investment is being actively sought,
and the northwest onshore areas, undertaking fuller development of coal and
hydro potential and making structural adjustment in industry to improve the
efficiency of energy use and permit the replacement of oil by coal. Coal
mines would have to be modernized and transportation constraint resolved;
while prospects of offshore oil discoveries are rated as high, oil in
significant amounts would be secured only after an extensive period of
exploration and development; similarly projects for developing hydro potential
have a long lead time. In industry, which consumes over 70% of total
commercial energy, major investments to improve and alter processes and
modernize older facilities will also take a few years to have substantial
impact, although significant savings should be achievable with little or no
investment in the shorter term. Investment in many of these areas, however,
is unlikely to yield significant results during the eighties. It is,
therefore, critical that steps be taken to stem the anticipated decline in oil
production and to obtain maximum impact from energy conservation. In the
petroleum sector, China would need to develop rapidly the small oilfields
which have already been discovered, undertake seismic surveys around existing
oilfields in order to discover and identify peripheral sands, initiate a
program for EOR, etc.



- 22 -
2.37     China is now facing problems typical to all oil producers, that is,
being required to undertake exploration and production under increasingly
difficult and complex conditions. Achievement of the above mentioned medium
term objectives would thus require, not only increased investment in the oil
and gas sector, but also a major infusion of modern technology and
equipment. Bank lending in the petroleum sector will have three basic
objectives: Firstly to develop known hydrocarbon bearing structures in order
to partially offset the anticipated decline; secondly to provide a vehicle for
the induction of modern technology to the Chinese oil industry; thirdly to
assist in training and upgrading the skills of China's oil industry personnel
in current oilfield practices.
2.38     On account of an extended period of technological isolation during
the development of oil industry, China has not been successful in discovering
petroleum in complex geological environments nor has it developed the
technological capability to increase the recovery of oil from existing
fields. GOC is seeking the assistance of foreign oil companies in exploring
and developing its offshore areas. This would, over a period of time, also
result in the transfer of offshore technology. In the onshore area,
especially in regard to the discovered and developed oilfields, the GOC
expects the Bank to act as a similar conduit for transferring technology.
During project preparation, substantial staff input was required for
iKdentifying areas where technology needed to be upgraded. Much of the
equipment used in the fields such as Daqing and Zhongyuan is obsolescent;
there is relatively limited familiarity in the techniques relating to deep
drilling and field practices such as drilling, cementing, casing, and
formation logging require an indepth evaluation. The attention of the Chinese
authorities has been drawn to the need to upgrade field practices; the current
project would address itself directly to these issues by helping finance the
import of modern equipment and technology. Further work will be needed in
preparing terms of reference for technical studies, selection of consultants,
supervision of studies, evaluation of findings, and finalizing and
implementing a plan of action based on these results, etc. GOC has sought the
Bank's assistance in this area which would be provided during the
implementation of the proposed project--and this is the primary rationale for
the Bank's participation.
2.39     Just like the Daqing Oilfield - Gaotaizi Reservoir Development
Project, an important objective under the proposed loan is the training of
Chinese technical staff and strengthening of their capabilities. Not only
would engineers and technicians be trained in the use of new equipment and in
modern petroleum engineering practices, but a well equipped training center
would be established together with operational laboratories to supplement the
operational work in the field. The loan will also assist in shaping the
future investment program by helping finance important pre-investment
studies. In the medium term the Bank's involvement in the sector would be
aimed at developing rapidly the small oilfields which have already been
discovered, undertaking seismic surveys in the vicinity of existing producing
fields, and identifying and initiating enhanced oil recovery programs. Bank
assistance would, therefore, be directed to further consolidate China's
production capabilities and subsequently assisting its exploration investment
program.

III. THE BENEFICIARY
Background
3.01     Seismic work in the Zhongyuan oil fields commenced in 1974 and the
first discovery was made in 1977. The initial task relating to exploration
and development was undertaken by the Shengli Oilfield Administration. In
September 1981, Dongpu Oilfield Administration was created to undertake
exploration and development in the counties of Dongming and Puyang covering an
area of 5,300 square kilometers. In April 1982, the jurisdiction of this
organization was extended to the northwest portion of Shandong and Henan
Provinces, and its area of activity was expanded to 20,000 square kilometers.
The oilfield management entity was renamed as the Zhongyuan Petroleum
Exploration Bureau (ZPEB).
Functions
3.02     ZPEB functions as a state-owned commercial enterprise, falls under
the jurisdiction of MOPI, and operates as a distinct juridical personality.
Its current functions encompass:
-    Seismic work
-    Exploration
-    Oilfield development
-    Developing and processing natural gas
-    Sale of crude oil and natural gas to authorities/organizations
designated by the state
-    Undertaking related downstream activities.
Capital Structure
3.03     The development of the Zhongyuan oilfield has been financed
exclusively by contributions from the Government and ZPEB's internally
generated funds. Government contribution is allocated annually to ZPEB
according to the investment plan and is channelled through the Construction
Bank. ZPEB has recently been permitted by the Government to secure loans for
undertaking oilfield investment from the Construction Bank. However, its
current outstanding long term debt is nominal. Its total networth as of
January 1, 1982, was $453 million.
Organization and Management
3.04     ZPEB management vests in a president, who is assisted by eight vice-
presidents in charge of production, drilling, capital construction,
administration, geology, research and design, personnel and logistics
respectively. ZPEB's functions are largely managerial, with specialized
companies being responsible for various oilfield activities. These companies
are sub-units of ZPEB and are not separate legal entities. Currently there



- 24 -
are three production companies, each company being responsible for developing
the three discovered oilfields, namely, Wenliu, Pucheng, and Wenmingzhai.
These companies carry out drilling through the Drilling Company No. 1.
Drilling Company No. 1 in turn secures specialized services like logging,
cementation, and other downhole services from ZPEB's specialized companies,
established specifically for this purpose. Service construction is carried
out by the Service Construction Company and all material is secured and
provided to various companies by the Material Supply Company. The
responsibility for research, design and provision of scientific, geological
and engineering support rests with the Geological Institute and the Research
and Design Institute. All tasks relating to exploration are currently being
undertaken directly by ZPEB. Exploratory drilling is carried out by the
Drilling Company No. 2. An organization chart for ZPEB is in Annex 3.01.
3.05. The companies follow the standard Chinese organizational pattern,
namely, they are divided into brigades, and brigades in turn into teams. A
brigade consists of 10-15 specialists, who function as staff officers to the
brigade leader. The brigade leader is responsible for the fulfillment of
stipulated targets by the teams under its command. The brigade leader and the
staff are usually professionals with managerial responsibilities, while
skilled workers man the teams. A team typically consists of between 50-100
persons with the team leader who is an experienced skilled worker.
3.06     Exploration and production targets are established annually for ZPEB
by MOPI. These targets are derived from the annual planned targets fixed for
the petroleum sector by the State Planning Commission. These targets,
initially framed in broad outline, are passed down to ZPEB, which fleshes out
the details, evaluates feasibility and works out the financial implications.
The annual plan is usually agreed upon and finalized after several
iterations. Following a similar process, ZPEB in turn evolves a work program
for various companies, their respective brigades and teams. Once this
exercise has been completed, ZPEB enjoys considerable operational autonomy and
is answerable to MOPI only for results. Its financial autonomy is, however,
more constrained; ZPEB must secure inputs from designated sources at pre-
determined prices; similarly it must sell its output to specified agencies at
prices which are set by the Government. Its investment plan must conform to
the national priorities and even within the framework of the approved plan, it
must seek the clearance of the Central Government for any foreign exchange
expenditure or material inputs designated as essential.
3.07     ZPEB's personnel is hardworking, disciplined and competent, which
makes it an effective organization capable of carrying out its pre-assigned
tasks. Its managers appear perceptive about their organizational and
technical problems, both in research and production. Its technical
deficiencies arise on account of outdated equipment, obsolescent technology
and a general lack of familiarity with deep drilling and its concomitant
problems. Organizationally, there is a discernable premium on the achievement
of physical targets and absence of a similar emphasis on quality control. The
project, as designed, takes these limitations into account. The major
emphasis is on securing new technology, refurbishing research facilities,
modifying and improving field facilities, upgrading the level of training and
organizationally inducting modern management practices (see para. 4.13).
Overall, there is little doubt that ZPEB will be able to carry out this
project with competence and speed.

Project Implementation
(a) Production Company
3.08     Production Company No. 1 (PCN1), which operates the Wenliu oilfield,
will be responsible for developing the southern extension. Production has
commenced recently in this oilfield and for the current year it is expected to
be 300,000 tons. PCNI has a work force of about 1800 workers including 67
technicians and 28 engineers. The company is headed by a director who is
assisted by five vice directors responsible for production, administration,
technical management, personnel, and capital construction and logistics. The
company operates through oil production brigades (four), each of which
oversees oil production teams (66), which have direct responsibility for
operating and maintaining oil and water injection wells. The oil production
brigades/teams are supported by similarly organized brigades/teams which are
responsible for well servicing, gas production, maintenance and repairs,
geological and technical services, transportation, etc. An organization chart
of PCN1 is in Annex 3.02. PCN1 is a recently established company, it
currently operates 82 oil and water injection wells; production from another
49 wells is expected to commence as soon as the composite station and the
necessary surface construction facilities are completed. Until recently, it
had been acted more or less as a division of ZPEB, but as of January 1983, it
enters into direct contractual relationships with the relevant companies. It
will, among other things, need to augment its supervisory and quality control
capabilities and activities to ensure that drilling and completion of wells
conform to acceptable standards.
(b)   Drilling Company and Other Auxiliary Companies
3.09     ZPEB's Drilling Company No. 1 will be responsible for drilling the
oil and injection wells for the proposed project. It has a work force of
6,300 workers, of which 294 are technicians and 62 are engineers. It
currently operates 70 rigs and 27 additional rigs are in the process of being
secured. It is headed by a director who is assisted by five deputy directors,
each in charge of production, equipment, administration, engineering and
general services. The actual drilling is carried out through four production
brigades which in turn are subdivided into 16 drilling teams. Each drilling
team has between 50-60 skilled workers, is headed by a team leader, and
operates in shifts, twenty-four hours a day. Support for drilling operations
is provided by similarly constituted units, which are responsible for
cementation, mud engineering, installation, transportation equipment and
supply, etc. An organizational chart of the Drilling Company No. 1 is in
Annex 3.03. The performance of the company is adequate; in 1981 each rig on
an average logged 5,100 operating hours, of which drilling activity accounted
for 2,540 hours. On average each rig drilled about 10,000 meters.
3.10    Auxiliary companies provide specialized services to the Drilling
Company. The logging company undertakes formation logging and perforation
tasks. The downhole well servicing company is responsible for fracturing and
other downhole services. For the proposed project, PCNI will enter into
agreement with the Drilling Company No. 1 for undertaking all works relating
to development drilling, and the Drilling Company No. 1 in turn will enter
into similar agreements with the auxiliary companies for providing various
well services. For surface construction, a separate agreement will be entered



- 26 -
into between PCN1 and the Surface Construction Company. Besides these main
service companies, the services of a number of companies (materials,
communication, transportation, repairs, etc.) will be secured as needed.
3.11    Work relating to exploration in the eastern extension of Wenliu
oilfield will be directly supervised by ZPEB through its specialized technical
departments. Until recently, drilling had been carried out by the Drilling
Company No.1. However, in view of the increasing workload, ZPEB has set up
another drilling company in end-1982, the Drilling Company No. 2, which is
exclusively in charge of exploratory drilling.
3.12     Expatriate consultants would be appointed for designing and preparing
the tender bids for the LPG extraction plant. The contract is proposed to be
awarded on a turnkey basis to an expatriate contractor, who will be
responsible for fabricating and commissioning the plant. The Gas Management
Company, which was established in end-1982, will be responsible for operating
this unit. An organization chart of this company is in Annex 3.04.
(c) Project Unit
3.13    ZPEB, PCN1, the Drilling Company No. 1 and other auxiliary companies
are capable of implementing the project. However, for coordinating and
monitoring the development program relating to the project, a special section
is proposed to be established in the office of the president of ZPEB. In
addition, a special project team headed by a deputy director would be
established in PCN1 and in the Gas Management Company. These teams will be
responsible for implementing the relevant components of the project. During
negotiations, assurance was obtained from ZPEB to establish such units by
September 30, 1983.
Financial/Accounting Practices
3.14     ZPEB follows the "Accounting System for State Run Enterprises"
enacted by GOC in 1953 and subsequently revised in 1960 and 1981. While the
accounting and financial arrangements of ZPEB (Annex 5.02) are satisfactory in
the context of China, there are fundamental differences between some of ZPEB?s
practices of commercially oriented petroleum enterprises. Special features of
ZPEB's financial and accounting arrangements are:
(a) ZPEB maintains two separate sets of accounts for its oilfield
activities--one set for capital construction and the other for
production. Since these two sets of accounts are not being
consolidated, ZPEB's balance sheet for production does not include
construction work-in-progress.
(b) MOPI finances the approved costs for exploration, and also makes
specific contribution to development. From mid 1982 on, ZPEB is
required to borrow from the Construction Bank for a portion_ of the
Government allocation for development at an interest of 2.1% p.a.
1/ Estimated at about 20% of the total investment and field maintenance
program over the period 1982-86.



- 27 -
(c) ZPEB's level of working capital is set by MOPI who until recently
allocated the entire amount to ZPEB free of charge. Under procedures
initiated in mid-1982, ZPEB has been required to borrow to supplement
MOPI's allocation by borrowing from the People's Bank for a portion
of the approved amount at 3.6% p.a. In the event such borrowing
requirements exceed the approved levels, interest rate for the
additional funds would be doubled, i.e. 7.2% p.a.
(d) ZPEB is permitted to charge as expenses sums up to approved yearly
budget limits to provide for overhaul and oilfield upholding before
computing net income. Funds retained under these provisions are the
major sources of ZPEB's self-financing for field maintenance, renewal
and development.
(e) ZPEB is required to transfer all net income and 50% of annual
depreciation to GOC. The balance of depreciation (50%) is retained
by ZPEB for field maintenance and renewal. Of the total
contributions to the Government, net incomel/ derived from investment
funded by the Construction Bank and 20% of annual depreciation are
considered debt service on the Construction Bank loan.
(f) While heavy emphasis is placed on the budget as a controlling tool,
ZPEB generally does not undertake financial planning beyond one year.
3.15     Given the uncertain range of recovery from the reservoirs and the
related costs of oil extraction, it would seem prudent for MOPI to extend the
horizon of financial planning in the industry as a tool for management
decision-making. It is recommended that ZPEB should reformulate its financial
planning based either within the existing financial set-up or on the
development of a new financial planning unit, with the objective of producing
financial plans for five years for its oilfield investment and operations.
The financial statements based on the five year plans would be discussed
annually with the Bank (para. 5.18). In addition, ZPEB is expected to
consolidate its accounts for oilfield capital construction and production [see
sub para. (a) above] in submitting its financial statements to the Bank in
order to provide an overall view of ZPEB's financial performance and position.
Costing
3.16     Financial accountability at ZPEB is organized under three levels of
cost center - the bureau, the company and the brigade. For budgeting
purposes, standard costing is applied. Standard unit costs for ZPEB are based
on the prevailing prices except in the case of imported casing and tubing
which are subsidized by MOPI. Budgeted cost is a major yardstick against
which the performance of the cost centers is being measured, and achievement
of cost targets is one of the bases for bonus reward (para. 3.19). However,
while management control relies heavily on the budget, it appears doubtful
whether the budget basis - especially in regard to standard quantities -
1/ Averaged at about 30% of the net income remitted to GOC over the next five
years.



- 28 
provides for adequate monitoring of the efficiency of operations. With the
view towards strengthening the monitoring and control function, it is
recommended that an evaluation of ZPEB's costing techniques be undertaken by
consultants as part of the study for devising a management information system
(para. 4.16). During negotiations ZPEB agreed that separate project accounts
would be maintained for the proposed project, whereby all the expenditures
actually incurred for the project are consolidated at the bureau level.
Internal Control System
3.17     Internal control procedures at ZPEB are generally adequate.  However,
ZPEB does not have at present an independent, comprehensive and systematic
centralized internal audit function. Control of fixed assets is performed by
the fixed assets section in the finance department; physical inventory of
material is carried out by the materials company in its various warehouses. A
financial discipline group, within the finance department at the bureau level,
is in charge of checking that the financial/accounting practices at ZPEB are
in line with the prescribed system of GOC. Such reviews are, however,
achieved on an ad-hoc basis, without a predetermined program and systematic
audit procedures. The financial discipline group is in part constrained by
the limited number of staff (presently only about three in total) and, for
large reviews, the group has to be supplemented by drawing upon the financial
staff from other units. Under the existing system, there is no provision for
an independent assessment of the effectiveness of ZPEB's internal control
system. The need for setting up a centralized and comprehensive internal
audit system was discussed both with ZPEB and MOF and MOF will review the
internal audit process in the context of the overall audit policies of GOC
(para. 3.18). This will be followed up during the supervision of the proposed
project.
External Audit
3.18     The GOC's present financial practice does not provide for external
auditing whose scope and depth are in conformity with internationally accepted
auditing standards. The responsibility of reviewing the accounts of state
enterprises in China is currently divided among the line ministry (MOPI), MOF,
the Construction Bank and the People's Bank. However, such reviews do not
constitute an independent audit of ZPEB's financial statements. MOF is
currently addressing this issue and is setting up an independent audit group
within the Ministry to review and certify the financial statements of state
enterprises. Regulations on auditing will be formulated and the independent
audit group may, within two years, be transferred to the jurisdiction of the
State Council. Technical assistance will be provided for this purpose by
several organizations, including UN and specific bilateral assistance. In the
context of this project, during negotiations GOC and ZPEB agreed to have the
project accounts and ZPEB's accounts independently audited and the financial
statements thereof be transmitted to the Bank within six months after the end
of each fiscal year.
Incentive System
3.19     Bonus is distributed monthly when the monthly targets for production,
cost, quality and safety, etc. are reached. Bonus amount varies with the
number of targets reached by individual sub-units, the lowest level of which



- 29 -
is a team. The maximum annual bonus for overall ZPEB is set by MOPI at 2.7
months of ZPEB's average worker salary. For purposes of bonus distribution,
ZPEB's staff is divided into three categories: (i) production workers; (ii)
service workers and (iii) office staff. Workers directly involved with
production receive the largest amount of bonus while the office staff are at
the lowest end of the bonus scale.
Insurance
3.20     ZPEB insures all its assets with the People's Insurance Company of
China. Insurance covers all major risks, including explosion and blowouts.
The People's Insurance Company is in turn reinsured with international
insurance companies. These arrangements are satisfactory.
IV. THE PROJECT
Background
4.01     The Zhongyuan basin lies about 500 km south of Beijing in a densely
populated agricultural area. It covers an area of 5,300 sq km, most of which
lies in Henan Province with a small part in Shandong Province. The Yellow
River traverses its southeastern portion.  Seismic surveys of the basin
started in 1974, and in 1977 the first commercial oil discovery was made.
Since then 17 structures have been shown to be hydrocarbon-bearing. Four of
these, Wenmingzhai, Weicheng, Pucheng and Central Wenliu, have been brought
into production with a current annual yield of 2.10 million tons oil and 291
million cu m of associated gas per year. In addition, four other fields,
including South and East Wenliu, have been determined to contain commercial
quantities of hydrocarbons. Reserve estimates of these fields are 200 million
tons of oil-in-place, 19.7 billion cu m of associated gas and 15.6 billion
cu m of free gas.
4.02     The project was defined during a Bank mission to China in September
1981. Its major components are the development of the South Wenliu field, the
exploration of the eastern extension of South Wenliu (East Wenliu), and LPG
plant, the import of modern and high technology oilfield equipment and
operational and technical assistance, including laboratories, a training
center, and a computer center.
Project Objectives
4.03     The immediate objectives of the proposed project are to:  (i) develop
the oil production potential of the South Wenliu field; (ii) explore and
evaluate the oil production potential of the East Wenliu discovery presently
estimated to have about 80-100 million tons of oil-in-place; and (iii) recover
LPG from associated gas which, during 1982, is expected to be flared at the
rate of 0.45 million cu m per day. Important elements in developing the South
Wenliu field will be the optimization of oil recovery and production rates
through appropriate secondary recovery techniques (para. 4.19) and improved
completion practices (para. 4.18). For the longer term, a more important
objective is to continue the process initiated under the Daqing Oilfield --
Gaotaizi Reservoir Development Project of introducing modern technology and



- 30 -
methods into the Chinese petroleum industry. To this end, the proposed
project provides through Bank financing imported modern oilfield equipment,
computer and training centers, laboratories and technical assistance.
Geology
4.04     The Zhongyuan basin is a structurally depressed trough filled with
sediments, mostly of Tertiary age, reaching a thickness of 9,000 m. It is
bordered by northwest-southeast striking faults. In this direction the basin
measures 120 km, and its width expands from 20 km in the north to 70 km in the
south. The main structural trapping mechanism is formed by a horstl/ type
ridge running centrally along its longitudinal axis. All the oil and gas
found so far has been located in the lower Tertiary sands on the flanks of
this ridge. These sands are separated by gypsum/salt and shale intervals; the
latter is believed to be the source rock for the accumulated hydrocarbons.
Faulting of the sands is intensive in the longitudinal direction, and
transverse faulting across the structure divides the fields into rectangular
blocks. A further description of the basin's geology may be found in
Annex 4.01.
Oil and Gas Production Prospects
4.05     The South Wenliu oilfield, to be developed under the proposed
project, is situated on the eastern flank of the basin's central ridge at
about 50 km from the northern limit of the basin. The productive lower
Tertiary sands have been penetrated by 35 wells, of which 19 have been tested
so far and 15 found productive. Bank-financed reservoir consultants (Core Lab
-- USA) evaluated the field's reserves and production potential in 1981 (see
Annex 4.02). Their findings were essentially in agreement with the Chinese
estimates, but the productive area of the field has now been extended, as a
result of additional drilling, to include 5 blocks, and estimated oil reserves
have substantially increased. The hydrocarbons in place on the basis of
current test results are estimated to be 47.8 million tons of oil and 1.84
billion (109) cu m of free gas (para. 4.07). During the initial stages of
production, associated gas is expected to be produced at the average rate of
178 cu m per ton of oil (equivalent to about 830 cu ft per barrel). Peak
production from the field is expected to be about 1.0 million tons of oil and
178 million cu m of associated gas per year. Most sands will produce oil
having 0.81 to 0.84 specific gravity, a sulfur content of 0.1 - 0.35%, a pour
point 2/ of 29-35 C and viscosity ranging from 3.5 - 12.6 centipoises at
surface conditions.
Production Plan and Project Design
4.06     South Wenliu.  The South Wenliu reservoir consists of thin sands
generally one to two meters thick with porosities ranging from 15 - 24% and
permeabilities from 20 to 300 millidarcy (md). Since there is no evidence of
an active bottom or edge water drive in the reservoir, solution gas drive will

2/ Temperature at which the oil will solidify.



- 31 -
be the primary production mechanism. Production experience in the basin
indicates that secondary recovery techniques are necessary within a relatively
short period after producing the field in order to increase the ultimate
recovery. ZPEB had planned on using water flooding as the secondary recovery
method, but during appraisal it was agreed that the Bank-financed reservoir
engineering study (para. 4.19) would investigate the application of both water
and gas injection to determine the optimum recovery mechanisms.
4.07     For production purposes, ZPEB proposes to divide the total sand
interval into four zones, each measuring 100 - 150 m with an effective sand
thickness of 5 - 15 m. Each zone would be developed with separate well
patterns for production and for water or gas injection. Spacing would be such
as to allow an in situ potential of 250,000 tons of oil for each production
well. With a recovery rate of 34% (probably the maximum which can be
achieved), each well would yield a total production of 85,000 tons of oil and
12 million cu m of associated gas over the productive life of the field. On
this basis, adequate drainage of the five blocks included in the project area
would require 220 wells, 156 for production and 64 for injection. This total
includes 16 appraisal wells, already drilled, which can be converted to
production; consequently, only 204 new wells would have to be drilled. The
proposed production plan, both with respect to the number of production and
injection wells to be drilled and the zones they are to be completed in, is
subject to modification as additional reservoir data are acquired and results
of the reservoir engineering study and the drilling and completion study
(paras. 4.18 and 4.19) become available.
4.08     Further study of the extensive faulting in the field is necessary
before all the production and injection wells can be located and drilled. An
essential element in this will be the results of the three-dimensional (3-D)
seismic survey ($6.8 million), financed by the Bank under the Daqing
Oilfield -- Gaotaizi Reservoir Development Project and started in October 1982
which, along with additional well data, is expected to give a much clearer
picture of the faults. Since the 3-D seismic results will not be available
until the third quarter 1983, it will be important, in the interim, to drill
only those wells which are located at a safe distance from the known faults.
ZPEB had accordingly agreed that during this period it will limit drilling to
113 wells, the maximum number that can be accommodated with the recommended
spacing and by staying at least 75 m away from the longitudinal faults which
are reasonably well defined by previous seismic data and appraisal wells and
250 m away from the less well defined transverse faults. The remaining wells
lying closer to the faults will be located and drilled after final
interpretation of the 3-D seismic survey.
4.09     East Wenliu.  East Wenliu lies on South Wenliu's east flank and is
interpreted to be an easterly dipping monocline bordered by a large fault
(Xulon) on the west. In the northern portion, the fault splits into a two-
fault system, separated by a 2 x 15 km block (W9) containing two
culminations. ZPEB has drilled into each culmination and discovered oil. The
3-D seismic survey will include all the East Wenliu area except for the
northern portion containing the block already drilled.
4.10     ZPEB's exploration strategy in the East Wenliu area was reviewed
during appraisal and was found satisfactory. It comprises the drilling of 13
wells during 1983-84, three of which would be drilled before completion of the



- 32 -
3-D seismic work. Two of these will be drilled to further explore the W9
block and the third at the point of high closure of the monocline against the
fault. Three additional exploration wells are programmed in the area covered
by the 3-D seismic survey after the interpretation of its results. If
successful, these would be followed by 7 appraisal wells to evaluate the
field's extent and production potential. During negotiations, ZPEB agreed to
consult with the Bank and agree on a program regarding the drilling locations
and objectives of the 10 wells to be drilled following completion of the 3-D
seismic survey. In case the seismic survey or drilling results should
indicate further drilling is not warranted in East Wenliu, ZPEB would direct
this drilling effort to other areas in the Zhongyuan basin to be agreed upon
with the Bank.
4.11     LPG Recovery.  The proposed project includes funds to finance
engineering services for: (i) undertaking a conceptual study to determine the
optimum process design; (ii) preparing basic engineering, process and design
specifications and a bid package for the supply and erection of the LPG
recovery facilities on a turnkey basis; and (iii) assisting in prequalifying
contractors and in implementing, commissioning and initial operation of the
facilities. The plant will be located at a site still to be selected between
the Pucheng and Central Wenliu oilfields with the initial gas supply coming
from these two fields. It will be designed to process 1.0 million cu m of
associated gas per day to yield, depending on actual gas compositions, an
estimated 190 tons per day of propanes and butanes and 40 tons per day of
condensate (pentanes and heavier hydrocarbons). Plant and process design will
include provisions for future ethane recovery. Initial products will be LPG
having a propane-butane composition varying seasonally from 75% - 25% to 60% -
40% and propane as a separate product. The amount of propane produced
separately will depend on the quantity remaining after making up the LPG
composition and utilizing all the butane recovered from the gas. During
negotiations, assurance was obtained that ZPEB will appoint qualified
consultants in accordance with the Bank's guideline on consultants to carry
out the studies and tasks necessary for implementing this component of the
project.
LPG and Natural Gas Market
4.12     LPG and natural gas will be distributed and marketed by the Gas
Management Company. Demand for propane and LPG far exceeds the available
supply, and no marketing difficulty is foreseen. Approximately 40-50,000 tons
of propane per year could be used in steel hardening and a similar quantity
for metal cutting and welding. However, most of the propane will go into LPG
which will be essentially used for the domestic market. The stripped natural
gas will be allocated as follows: two small fertilizer plants (0.55)1/,
oilfield fuel (0.25), domestic consumers (0.15) and winter heating (0.05).
Condensates (pentane plus) for which there is no local market will be combined
and shipped with the crude oil.
1/ In million cu m per day.

(vi)  oilfield safety practices.
(j) Pre-investment Studies
The undertaking of conceptual and feasibility studies in connection

Project Implementation
4.14     ZPEB will have the overall responsibility for implementing the
project. Under its supervision, Production Company No. 1 (PCN1) will
implement, and subsequently operate, the South Wenliu oil development
component of the project. Gas Management Company have similar implementation
and operating responsibilities for the LPG plant. ZPEB will supervise the
East Wenliu exploration drilling itself. In developing production in South
Wenliu, PNCI will essentially act as the concessionnaire of the area. It will
subcontract the various implementation tasks to other ZPEB sub-units. The
three sub-units playing major subcontracting roles will be: (i) Drilling
Company No. 1 (which, in turn, will subcontract such services as well logging,
testing and completion to specialized well service subsidiaries of ZPEB) for
the production and injection wells; (ii) Research and Design Institute for
design and engineering of all surface installations and facilities; and (iii)
Surface Construction Company for the construction of these surface
installations and facilities. The LPG plant will be procured on a single
responsibility turnkey basis from a foreign supplier. Expatriate consultants
financed from the Bank loan would assist in the various implementation
activities, including construction supervision, commissioning and initial
operation. Drilling Company No. 2 will carry out the exploratory drilling in
East Wenliu. During negotiations, assurance was obtained that ZPEB would



- 35 -
establish by September 30, 1983: (i) a special project team in PCNI headed by
a deputy director for supervising and coordinating the South and East Wenliu
development and exploration activities; and (ii) a similar team in the Gas
Management Company for the LPG plant project component.
4.15     ZPEB is a large organization (para. 3.09) which operated 70 medium
and heavy duty drilling rigs. They drill and complete about 180 deep wells
every year. Their drilling record and capacities are reviewed in para. 4.18
with special reference to drilling difficulties encountered in the area. The
import of equipment suitable for drilling at deeper depths and the upgrading
of presently used techniques are designed to ensure that the project drilling
difficulties are minimized. Overall, ZPEB is a well managed company and, with
the technical assistance provided under the project (para. 4.13) , it will be
able to efficiently implement the project.
4.16     ZPEB and its sub-units are staffed by dedicated and competent
personnel who have the requisite experience and capabilities to effectively
carry out the respective project tasks. However, because of ZPEB's short
existence as an independent entity and its transition from being predominantly
an exploration organization to a major petroleum production organization as
well, management capabilities, especially in the subsidiary companies, need to
be augmented and redirected. To develop them into a smooth functioning group,
attention must be given to lines of responsibility and coordination among the
various organization units. The Zhongyuan operations are extensive and cover
an area of over 20,000 square kilometers. Thousands of seismic lines and
about 200 wells are drilled annually. For this purpose, ZPEB is required to
monitor, oversee and coordinate the activities of a large number of
companies. The existing structure is inadequate for providing pertinent
technical information on a timely basis, and management is not organized to
ingest and respond to it adequately. The computer facilities proposed for the
project (para. 4.20) make it possible to design and implement a management
information system to enable ZPEB to effectively manage and monitor the
oilfield activities. In this context, the costing techniques of ZPEB would
need to be evaluated in order to provide its management with appropriate
operational information (both technical and financial) for monitoring and
control purposes (see para. 3.16). ZPEB has agreed to appoint consultants to
devise a management information system. The proposed consultancy would be
financed under the loan and by December 31, 1983, ZPEB would review the
consultants' recommendations of the study with the Bank for purposes of
formulating a future course of action.
Project Implementation Schedule
4.17     The project implementation schedule is shown in Annex 4,04.  All
project components are scheduled to be completed by end-1985. South Wenliu
development drilling and the installation of surface production and operating
facilities should be completed by end-1984 and exploration drilling in East
Wenliu by the 4th quarter, 1985. The LPG plant should be completed by mid-
1985 and be commissioned and fully operational by no later than the beginning
of 1986. The South Wenliu drilling schedule is tight but should be achieved
based on the number of rigs ZPEB is likely to secure by end-1982 and its past
drilling performance in the area. There should be no difficulty in meeting
the completion targets for the remaining project components.



- 36 -
Drilling and Completion Practices
4.18     ZPEB is encountering considerable difficulties on account of hostile
drilling conditions and inadequate equipment and technique. Pay zones are
deep, drilling is being undertaken to the depth of 3,500 to 4,000 meters, and
deeper wells are being planned to explore horizons up to 6,500 meters. High
pressure and temperature are continually encountered. The use of fresh water
mud, while drilling through thick salt beds and evaporites has resulted in
salt washouts, hole enlargements and formation caving. In spite of many
experiments, ZPEB has not been able to select drilling fluid compatible with
the present high downhole temperatures and pressures. These and other factors
have resulted in sluggish drilling, corrosion, collapsed casing, problems of
cement bond, hole enlargement, etc. Several wells drilled are out of
commission on this account; a situation which would be further exacerbated as
ZPEB proceeds to drill deeper horizons. Import of equipment capable of
drilling to these depths would not be enough; ZPEB would need to import
techniques suited for the drilling conditions being encountered in
Zhongyuan. These aspects were reviewed with ZPEB and MOPI. ZPEB has agreed
to appoint qualified consultants to study the various drilling, mud and
completion problems with a view to evolving a package of field practices which
are consistent with the needs of the Zhongyuan basin and which would help
reduce drilling and completion costs through savings of material usage and
reduction of drilling time. The proposed study would be financed out of the
proceeds of the loan, and is expected to be completed by December 31, 1983.
Its findings will be reviewed with the Bank, and further course of action will
be agreed upon. This could include securing an expatriate specialist for a
period of time to supervise certain critical aspects of deep drilling and
train ZPEB's personnel therein, and the financing for this is included in the
proposed loan. Notwithstanding the drilling and completion problems noted
above, ZPEB is expected to implement the project competently with the support
of technical assistance (para. 4.15).
Reservoir Engineering Study
4.19     The productive formation of Wenliu oilfield consists of a series of
thin beds of sand interlaid with shales. Productive zone depths range from
3,500 meters to 4,000 meters. Structurally, the Wenliu field is complex, and
dissected by many longitudinal and cross faults. The reservoir oil is under-
saturated with gas and connate water is highly saline with calcarious
content. Further, the oil reservoir lacks an outside energy source (a large
acquifer or gas cap) and, therefore, secondary recovery methods would need to
be applied, almost from the initial stages. A Bank-financed consultant, Core
Laboratories, Inc., estimated that water injection, if successful, could
almost double the recovery factor to about 34% of the original oil-in-place.
However, more detailed investigation and laboratory studies are required
before deciding on the medium and pattern of injection fluid. In the first
place, a geological model of the reservoir would need to be built, thereafter
the suitability of the injection fluid, whether it is water from shallow
source beds or unassociated gas from a separate nearby fault block would need
to be established. With these inputs, it should be possible to evolve an
optimum pattern of production wells, injection and production rates and well
completion and monitoring techniques consistent with the ultimate objective of
ensuring the maximum possible recovery. ZPEB has agreed that a study for this
purpose would be carried out by December 31, 1983, with the assistance of



- 37 -
qualified expatriate consultants. The results of this study would be reviewed
with the Bank and an action plan agreed upon. ZPEB has further agreed that
wells drilled during 1983 will not be completed as injectors and the choice of
injection -- production pattern will await the results of the study.
Computer Facilities
4.20     Presentlv, ZPEB has no computer facility.  Seismic data processing
has been carried out by the Beijing Geophysical Research Center. The need of
establishing a computer center for handling multitude of exploration and
production data is self-evident. Accordingly, Bank-financed consultants
visited the Zhongyuan oilfield in May 1982 to assess the computer require-
ments. The consultants have recommended a system for collecting and
processing geological/geophysical drilling and production data and the
relevant software required for establishing a production command and
management system for the exploration and development of the Zhongyuan
oilfields. The findings of the consultants were reviewed with ZPEB's
management/MOPI and specifications relating to the computer were finalized
during negotiations.
Training
4.21     The proposed project includes provisions for the establishment of a
training center for skilled workers in the Zhongyuan area. A training center
for professional personnel is not included in the project because the number
of professionals assigned to the Zhongyuan operations is not felt to be
sufficiently large to justify the expense of establishing such a facility. It
is planned to provide such training at China's petroleum institutes and
universities and through professional training facilities abroad. The skilled
workers' training center will have an initial capacity of about 1,080 trainees
a year and will provide:
(a) basic training for skilled workers along with courses in drilling,
production, well logging, cementing, mud chemistry, instrumentation,
pipe fitting, welding, laboratory work, etc.;
(b) periodic refresher courses to ensure that workers keep abreast of
latest technology and techniques;
(c) language courses, especially for specialists selected for foreign
training; and
(d) equipment, training aids, laboratories, teaching materials and other
facilities necessary for imparting various categories of training
envisaged under the center training program.
4.22     In addition to the formal training in the center, on-the-job training
will be provided for both skilled and professional workers through: (i)
professionals working closely with consultants engaged in the various studies
and technical assistance program included in the proposed project; and (ii)
skilled workers working under the supervision of expatriates hired through
service contracts to operate and maintain equipment supplied under the
project.



- 38 -
4.23     ZPEB plans to build a training center having a covered area of about
2,000 sq m in the Zhongyuan area by September 30, 1984 and to equip it with a
complete drilling rig, workover rig, pumping units, welding machines, and
other locally available relevant material and equipment. Bank-financed
consultants have completed a preliminary study of the training needs of the
ZPEB personnel, and the recommended curricula are outlined in Annex 4.06.
ZPEB intends to enter into collaboration with a foreign institution for a
limited period of time to ensure that the training center has access to
appropriate and modern teaching methods. Arrangements in this regard were
reviewed during negotiations and assurance was obtained that ZPEB will build
and equip a training center by September 30, 1984.
Laboratories
4.24     ZPEB's need for refurbishing the existing laboratories and
establishing new ones was reviewed by Bank consultants (French Petroleum
Institute). A distinction has been made between laboratories which would
carry out operationally-oriented research under the Research and Design
Institute (RDI) and the field laboratories which perform purely operational
functions with various companies. For laboratories under RDI, equipment will
be provided for: (i) special core analysis; (ii) pressure-volume-temperature
(PVT) analysis for oil and gas; and (iii) water flooding; and for geological
laboratory encompassing sedimentology, paleontology and palynology. Field
laboratories will be for analyzing drilling muds and oil well cements.
Project Costs
4.25     The proposed project is estimated to cost an equivalent of US$499.8
million, including contingencies and the capitalized front-end fee of US$0.75
million on the Bank loan. The estimated project costs are summarized in the
following table; a more detailed cost breakdown appears in Annex 4.03.

4.26     Drilling and development costs were derived from ZPEB's current cost
records and reflect the low level of salaries and other local costs. The cost
of imported materials and goods is based on the estimates provided by
suppliers in 1982. Consultant costs for 416 man-months were estimated at a
man-month rate of US$17,000 for personnel based in the home office and
US$20,000 (inclusive of travel and subsistence) for staff assigned to China.
The cost of service contracts for highly specialized equipment is included in
the purchase contract costs. The basic cost estimate is based on end-1982
prices. A physical contingency rate of 7% was applied to all foreign costs
and 10% to local costs except for the LPG plant, which carries a contingency
of 20%. A relatively low physical contingency rate was applied to foreign
costs in view of the fact that most of the imported equipment provided under
the project has already been identified. Local costs for drilling and
construction are estimated on the basis of ZPEB's past experience. They are
subject to tight control through budget allocations. Price escalation for
both local and foreign costs was applied at the rate of 8% for FY83, 7.5% for
FY84, 7% for FY85 and 6% for FY86.

Project Financing
4.27     The financing plan for the proposed project is expected to be as
follows:
PROJECT FINANCING PLAN
(US$ Million)
Foreign
Local           Exchange           Total
IBRD Loan                                               100.8            100.8
GOC/ZPEB/Suppliers' Credit              -                56.7             56.7
GOC/ZPEB                              342.3              -               342.3
342.3             157.5            499.8
4.28     The Bank loan of US$100.8 would represent 20% of the total project
cost and 64% of the foreign exchange cost. The loan would be made to GOC at
standard IBRD interest rates over 20 years, including a five-year grace period
and a front-end fee of 0.75%. GOC would onlend $96.8 million to ZPEB on the
same terms and conditions under a subsidiary loan agreement. Foreign exchange
risk will be borne by ZPEB. Execution of the subsidiary loan agreement would
be a condition of effectiveness of the proposed Bank loan.
Procurement and Disbursement
4.29     Drilling and construction work would be carried out by force account
(ZPEB's own forces) with the Bank financing only goods, services and
equipment. ZPEB's forces are experienced and competent to carry out this work
and this practice has been shown to be more cost effective (para. 4.26).
Goods, services and equipment to be financed under the proposed Bank loan
would be procured by international competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance
with the Bank's guidelines, except in cases where limited international
tendering (LIT) and direct purchase are more appropriate. LIT would be used
in procuring highly specialized goods or services available only from a
limited number of suppliers in which case bids would be requested from those
qualified international suppliers known to be capable of supplying such goods
and services. In view of the high percentage of proprietary and specialized
equipment provided under this project, it is foreseen that disbursement under
ICB and LIT would represent about 40% and 57% of the total loan
respectively. Spares and goods or services costing less than US$150,000
equivalent and not likely to attract international bidding may be procured
through direct purchase up to an aggregate of US$3.0 million (3% of the Bank
loan). All bid packages having an estimated value of US$500,000 or more would
be subject to prior review by the Bank.



- 41 -
4.30     Disbursement of the Bank loan would be against 100% of the foreign
exchange cost of consultants' services and training programs, 100% of the
foreign exchange cost of the LPG plant and imported equipment (listed in
detail in Annex 4.07) and 100% of the ex-factory cost of the LPG plant and
equipment which will be supplied from local sources under ICB. Insofar as the
LPG plant is concerned, disbursement of the Bank loan would be against the
design, supply and commissioning, but excluding civil works and
installations. The following table shows the loan allocation:
Amount Allocated         % of
US$ Million         Expenditure

TOTAL                                  100.80
4.31     The loan is expected to be fully disbursed by June 30, 1986 and the
closing date would be December 31, 1986. The disbursement schedule can be
found in Annex 4.05. In the absence of a standard disbursement profile
applicable to this type of project, the disbursement schedule is based on a
three-month time lag between the time the expenditure is estimated to have
been incurred and the time the equivalent funds are disbursed from the loan.
Project Risks
4.32     The project carries the geological and operational risks normally
accompanying petroleum exploration and development. In the case of South
Wenliu, the geological risk is not considered to be a serious one. Data from
35 wells (para. 4.05) drilled into the structure and the results of the
seismic data of general good quality make for a fairly confident estimate of
the size of the oil deposit. Nevertheless, it must be recognized that the
behavior of a reservoir can never be predicted with certainty. The field is
characterized by zones of thin productive sands which may present production
problems, and secondary recovery methods (water and/or gas injection) may not
be as effective as expected. These factors could lead to an oil recovery rate
substantially less than the 34% now anticipated. However, even if only 20%
(60% of the base case) of the oil-in-place is recovered, the project component
would still have an attractive rate of return of 46%. Regarding East Wenliu,
oil has already been discovered by two wells in the northern portion and from
a geological standpoint, there is promise that the rest of the field will be
oil-bearing. The 3-D seismic survey and technical assistance included in the
proposed project should attenuate the risks associated with the development of
South Wenliu and exploration in East Wenliu.



- 42 -
4.33     The project's operational risks are mainly those associated with most
oil well drilling. Minimizing these risks requires strict well control and
blow-out prevention practices and experienced crews. Although its equipment
is outmoded by at least 20 years by Western standards, the ZPEB has
demonstrated that its drilling crews can successfully drill the Wenliu
structures. Some tests are planned of the deep lying high pressure and
temperature zones in the East Wenliu field during the exploration drilling.
The combination of deep drilling along with high temperatures and pressures
will pose a new challenge to the drilling crews. Expatriate technical
assistance in deep drilling and high pressure blow-out prevention equipment is
included in the proposed project to help make these operations successful.
Ecology and Safety
4.34     The ZPEB drilling and production operations pose a minimal threat to
the ecology. Oil and liquid wastes would be the major concern. However, all
such wastes are kept in closed systems and treated before disposal. Although
crews are well trained there is concern over the safety measures and practices
in ZPEB's well drilling operations because of the outmoded equipment,
especially with regard to blow-out prevention, and technology. There is also
evidence that safety precautions are not enforced as strictly as they should
be. The matter was reviewed with 7PEB, and it was agreed that a safety
expert, well versed in the safet3 aspects of the petroleum industry, should
visit its operations with a view o developing adequate safety standards and
practices. During negotiations, assurance was obtained that ZPEB will review
with the Bank by August 31, 1983 their findings and recommendations and its
plan for implementing any new or improved safety measures.
Reporting Requirements
4.35     ZPEB would forward to the Bank quarterly project progress reports
covering: (i) technical progress; (ii) cost estimates, expenditures and
disbursements; and (iii) management and operations. The purpose of these
reports is to provide information on: (i) physical work accomplished during
the reporting period; (ii) comparison of the actual progress of construction
and related costs with the original estimates; (iii) the expected dates of
completion of the principal physical elements of the project; and (iv)
improvements including operating efficiency resulting from the implementation
of the consultants' recommendations emanating from the various studies. The
progress report format was discussed and agreed upon at negotiations.
V. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
Background
5.01     ZPEB was established as an independent state enterprise in September
1981. However, its finances continued to be consolidated with the Shengli
Oilfield Administration (SOA) until the end of 1981. As of January 1, 1982,
ZPEB's financial operations have been separated from those of SOA.
5.02     ZPEB is operating in a centrally planned economy in which all the
factors of production are tightly controlled. Two fundamental aspects -
financial autonomy and performance measurement - differentiate ZPEB from a



- 43 -
similar enterprise in a market economy. ZPEB's performance is measured on the
basis of product output under given budget parameters rather than
profitability. While ZPEB enjoys considerable operational-autonomy, it is far
more constrained in financial autonomy. Specifically, GOC (i) sets annual
production and net income targets for ZPEB; (ii) approves ZPEB's operational
and investment budgets; (iii) sets regulations for the conduct of ZPEB's
financial management; and (iv) sets detailed reporting requirements with which
ZPEB has to comply. Under these circumstances, any assessment of ZPEB's
financial performance based on financial norms usually applied in a market
economy would be of limited significance. Financial appraisal of ZPEB has,
therefore, been concentrated on costs (para 5.09), cash generation (para.
5.10), internal controls (para.3.17), budgetary controls (para.3.14) and
ZPEB's incentive system (para.3.19).
Present Financial Position
5.03     ZPEB's opening balance sheet as of January 1, 1982 is shown in Annex
5.01 and summarized as follows:
million Yuan           million US$             %
Net Fixed Assets                         694                  365              81
Current Assets                           233                  123              27

Fixed Assets Funds                       694                  365              81
Working Capital Funds                    167                   88              19
Total Net Worth          861                  453             100
5.04     ZPEB took over from SOA total assets amounting to Y861 million
(US$453 million) representing Y694 million in capital construction and field
production assets and Y167 million in working capital. These were financed
44% by the Government and 56% from the retained funds of SOA. No long-term
debt has been incurred by SOA on the assets transferred. The financial
position of ZPEB as of January 1, 1982 was satisfactory.
Future Finances
5.05     Financial projections for the period FY1982-86 are shown in Annexes
5.03, 5.04 and 5.05.  Salient features highlighting ZPEB's projected operating
results are summarized below:

Investment and Field Maintenance Program
5.06     ZPEB's investment and field maintenance program is projected to total
Y2.4 billion ($1.3 billion) for the period 1982-86. The proposed project
(estimated to cost $500 million) represents about 40% of the total planned
program which is given as follows:
Million Yuan        Million US$         %
Exploration                                859                452          35

Total       2,430              1,279         100
5.07     The above program provides for the drilling of about 1,160 wells, of
which 665 (57%) are production wells, the balance being exploratory wells.
Production from development is forecast to increase at an average rate of 23%
p.a. from 2.1 million tons in 1982 to 4.5 million tons in 1986. The rapid
1/ In constant price terms



- 45 
production growth reflects the early stage of the production life of Zhongyuan
Oilfield. These forecasts do not take into account any additional production
which may arise from exploration projects such as that at East Wenliu.
Pricing
5.08     Crude at Zhongyuan is presently priced by GOC at Y130 per ton.  On
the basis of this price, ZPEB's margin on crude is estimated to increase from
the present level of Y47/ton to Y60/ton by 1986. This would allow ZPEB to
finance its operational costs, as well as a portion of its investment and
field maintenance program, and still contribute net income on an increasing
scale to the government (see para. 5.14). However, taking account of the
rising costs of oil extraction in the country, MOPI has recently proposed an
increase in the price of crude to Y175 per ton throughout China. The price
increase is expected to become effective in 1984 and its major impact on ZPEB
would be to signifcantly increase its contributions to the government. This
is illustrated by ZPEB's projected contributions which could amount to Y422
million in 1986 as compared with Y266 million based on the existing price. In
the same year, ZPEB's operating ratio is estimated to be 0.46 at the increased
price against 0.61 should there be no price change.
Costs
5.09     A major factor affecting the cost of drilling is the depth of the
well. ZPEB's average depth of wells is expected to increase from the present
level of 2,850 meters to 3,150 meters by 1986. During the same period, its
unit cost of drilling is estimated to increase from Y495/meter to
Y530/meter. Financial forecasts indicate that over the next five years, total
cost of oil production would increase by an average of 13% p.a. Nonetheless,
production growth is expected to outpace cost increase, and ZPEB's unit cost
of crude production is projected to decrease by an average of 3% p.a., from
Y83/ton in 1982 to Y70/ton in 1986.
Funds Flow
5.10     ZPEB's projected funds flow is given below.  Revenues take into
account the expected crude price increase as from FY84.

5.11     ZPEB's self-financing ratio is forecast to increase steadily from 21%
in 1982 to 41% in 1986, an annual average of 32% which is satisfactory. IBRD
loan would provide about 7% of the total financing requirements. Government
funds, in form of contributions or loans, are expected to cover the balance of
the requirements, which are projected to decrease from Y376 million in 1982 to
Y309 million in 1986. Of the total requirements, Government contributions and
Construction Bank loan are expected to average 41% and 21% respectively.
5.12     Over the next five years, Government funds to ZPEB are forecast to
total Y1.5 billion. During the same period, ZPEB's remittance of net income
and depreciation funds to the Government is projected to total Y1.26 bilion
and, together with state sales tax of YO.3 bilion, ZPEB's fiscal contributions
are estimated at Y1.56 billion. Total Government take (ZPEB's fiscal
contributions less Government funds) is expected to be in a surplus position
of about Y53 million over the next five years. Government take is forecast to
increase rapidly from a deficit position of Y256 million in 1982 to a surplus
position from 1984 onwards, and would amount to an estimated Y215 million in
1986.
Financial Position
5.13     ZPEB's financial position is expected to be satisfactory over the
next five years. Its debt posiJion is projected to remain low, and



- 47 -
notwithstanding the recently instituted system of debt financing for
development, its debt/equity ratio is estimated at 1/99 in 1982 and 16/84 in
1986. ZPEB's liquidity position is expected to remain sound; current ratio is
expected to remain above 2.0 throughout the forecast period.
Sensitivity Analysis
5.14     The results of sensitivity analysis performed are summarized below:
Government Take      Production Cost        Operating

5.15     The results of sensitivity analysis indicate that even under less
favorable conditions, ZPEB's finances are forecast to remain satisfactory
within the context of financial arrangements in China. ZPEB would remain
profitable under all of the less favorable conditions presented above. Annual
government take is also expected to be in a surplus position by 1986 for all
of the above cases, except for the worst case scenario whereby production
would decrease by 10%, total expenses increased by 10%, and the price of crude
remains unchanged at Y130/ton.
Zhongyuan-Wenliu Petroleum Project
5.16     The quantified benefits of the proposed project include the
production of oil and gas from South Wenliu and recovery of natural gas
liquids from the LPG plant. The DCF financial rate of return is estimated at
14 % (in real terms) over the life of the project.
(a) Production
South Wenliu is projected to reach peak production (1.06 million tons
p.a.) in 1985, and would contribute some 28% of Zhongyuan oilfield's
production estimated for that year. The production of South Wenliu as
compared to Zhongyuan overall production is shown below:

(c) Drilling Costs
Average unit cost of drilling estimated for production wells in South
Wenliu and exploratory wells in East Wenliu are shown in Annex 5.06. Salient
features of the drilling costs at East and South Wenliu are summarized below:

5.17     The depth as well as difficulty of drilling conditions are
significantly greater at East Wenliu than those at South Wenliu. These are
reflected by the substantially lower monthly drilling rate and higher number
of rig months per well at East Wenliu. In addition, the wells at East Wenliu
are exploratory while those at South Wenliu are production wells. As a
result, the drilling cost at East Wenliu is expected to be substantially
higher, estimated at Y3.4 million per well as compared to Y1.9 million at
South Wenliu.
Performance Measurement
5.18     Within the context of financial arrangements in China, ZPEB's
finances are expected to remain satisfactory. However, since ZPEB is not
operated on a typical commercial basis, its financial performance especially
in regard to operating efficiency cannot be measured in the same manner as a
commercially oriented enterprise, and the application of the Bank's normal
financial covenants would be of limited significance. For these reasons, it
would be difficult if not impossible to formulate meaningful overall
quantitative performance covenants. The internal control system at ZPEB is
satisfactory (para. 3.17) and bonus reward is related to performance (para.
3.19). Nevertheless, the various studies provided by the proposed project are
directed at improving the operational efficiency of ZPEB and the
implementation of the recommendations resulting from these studies would be
followed up during the supervision process (Chapter IV). During negotiations,
assurances were obtained from ZPEB that it would review with the Bank by
October 1 of each year, starting from 1983, its current and projected
finances, focusing in particular on its trend of production costs, budget
variance analysis, as well as its future investment program and related
financing arrangements.

VI. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
Background
6.01     The development of the South Wenliu Oilfield will augment China's
production of oil for domestic consumption and/or export, and of gas for
domestic use, as oilfield fuel and fertilizer feedstock. In addition, the
project provides for upgrading the usage of gas by the recovery of LPG and
condensate. LPG will mainly be marketed for household uses and condensate
will be added to crude to be refined into higher value products. More
importantly, the project has been designed to result in the upgrading of the
level of technology and skills in the Chinese petroleum industry.
Project Benefits
6.02     The major quantifiable benefits from the project are the production
of crude oil, and to a lesser extent, gas and natural gas liquids. For the
purpose of economic evaluation, crude oil value (FOB Shanghai) has been
estimated at $208/ton in 1984 and escalated by 1 to 2% p.a. thereafter.
Freight costs from Zhongyuan oilfield to Shanghai have been estimated at $1
per ton.  The value of gas is conservatively taken to be the energy equivalent
of fuel oil for both fuel and fertilizer uses. This has been estimated at
$0.18/m3, based on fuel oil at  I Fernational price of $165/ton.  LPG and
condensate have been valued a  725 and $305 per ton respectively.  The
official exchange rate at the cime of appraisal ($1 = Y1.9) has been used for
all conversions and prices are expressed in 1982 dollars. The production
profile for the base case is sLmmarized as follows:
1984    1986    1988    1990
Crude (000 tons)                      651    1063      900     815
Gas (million m3)                      120      196     181      167
LPG (000 tons)                         -        64      64      64
Condensate (000 tons)                  -        14      14       14
Project Costs
6.03     For the purpose of economic return calculation, project costs include
the capital expenditures (75% of total project costs) and operating expenses
directly related to the development of South Wenliu and the LPG plant. The
local costs of cement and steel, the two major inputs, have been shadow priced
at international values with conversion factors of 1.1 and 1.17
respectively. In addition, the power component of the operating costs has
been shadow-priced at YO.20/kWh to reflect the scarcity of electricity in
China. However, domestic labor (1% of total production costs) has not been
shadow-priced in the light that skilled workers' wages are deemed to be
representative of their values, and unskilled labor costs constitute only a
norminal portion of the total production costs. Feed gas cost for the LPG
plant has been conservatively assumed at the Btu equivalent of fuel oil.

Economic Rate of Return and Net Present Value
6.04     Detailed economic analysis is shown in Annex 6.01.  Based on the
above assumptions, the economic rate of return for the project would be 74%.
The net present value of the project, at a 12% discount rate, is estimated at
$942 million over the life of the project. These values are high partly
because this is a petroleum development project which benefits from the "sunk
costs" of exploration in the Wenliu field.
Sensitivity Analysis
6.05     As inherent to other hydrocarbon development projects, the
uncertainty of reservoir behavior, especially in regard to recovery ratio, is
the major risk in this project. The results of sensitivity analysis indicate
that should the production be 70% of the base case which assumes a recovery
factor of 34%, the economic rate of return would be 50% and net present value
at $564 million. Ini the event of cost overruns by 20%, the economic rate of
return would be 70% and net present value at $889 million.  In the worst case,
where the value of crude remains at the 1984 price (in real terms) throughout
the project life, 20% cost overruns are incurred, and where the recovery is
only 70% of the expectation under the base case, the economic rate of return
would still be 37% and net present value at $389 million.
Other Benefits
6.06     Substantial transfer of technology is envisaged under the provisions
of the project which include training, import of modern and high technology
oilfield equipment, the setting up of a computer center and equipping of
laboratories. It is estimated that, annually, about 1,080 skilled workers
will receive advanced training under the project in all aspects of petroleum
industry. In addition, while it is as yet too uncertain to quantify the
benefits to be derived from the exploration of East Wenliu, the fact that
hydrocarbons have already been found in certain parts of that area indicates
that possibilities for the discovery of additional reserves could be high and
the potential returns from this investment would be significant.
VII. RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01     During negotiations, the following issues were raised and assurances
obtained that ZPEB would:
(a)  maintain a separate project account (para. 3.16);
(b)  submit audited financial statements of its accounts and those of
the project accounts to the Bank within 6 months after the end
of each fiscal year (para. 3.18);
(c)  review its current and future finances with the Bank by
October 1 of each year (paras. 3.15 and 5.18);
(d)  establish by September 30, 1983 a special project team headed by
a deputy director for the Production Company No. 1 and a similar
team for the Gas Management Company (para. 4.14);



- 52 -
(e)  after the completion of the 3-D seismic survey and drilling of
the first three exploration wells, consult with the Bank and
agree on a plan regarding objectives and location of further
drilling in East Wenliu (para. 4.10);
(f)  appoint qualified consultants to assist in carrying out the LPG
plant project component (para. 4.11);
(g)  carry out the following studies with the assistance of qualified
consultants and review their findings and recommendations with
the Bank and agree on a plan of action:
(i) by December 31, 1983 with respect to the management
information system study (para. 4.16);
(ii) by December 31, 1983 with respect to the drilling and
completion practices study (para. 4.18);
(iii) by December 31, 1983 with respect to the reservoir
engineering study (para. 4.19); and
(iv) by August 31, 1983 with respect to the oil field safety
practices study (para. 4.34); and
(h) Evolve training curricula and provide and equip a training
center on the basis to be agreed upon with the Bank by September
30, 1984 (para. 4.21).
7.02     A condition of effectiveness would be the execution of a satisfactory
subsidiary loan agreement between GOC and ZPEB (para. 4.28).
7.03     With satisfactory resolution of the items outlines above, the project
constitutes a suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$100.8 million.

CHINA
ZHONGYUAN - WENLIU PETROLEUM PROJECT
Geology of the Zhongyuan Basin
1.       The Zhongyuan basin is located in the plains of Central China at
about 500 kilometers south of Beijing. It covers an area of 5,300 square
kilometers and straddles the Yellow River with its south eastern flank. The
basin has an elongated north east-south west shape and measures 120 kilometers
in this direction. In the north it is 20 kilometers and in the south 70
kilometers wide. Structurally the basin is a depressed trough bounded by
faults striking northeast-southwest. This trough is assymmetrically filled
with Tertiary and some Mesozoic sediments. It is overlain by a horizontal
cover of Upper Tertiary and Quaternary sediments of about 1600 meters thick
extending far beyond the basins extremities. Thus no surface expression of
the basin exists.
2.       The basin was discovered in 1974 by regional geophysical
reconnaisance in the Central China plains, which had been in progress for many
years. Since then 20,000 km of seismic lines have been shot for its
delineation and further appraisal. Hydrocarbons were first discovered in 1975
and since then some 300 wells have been drilled.
3.       The main structural element of the Zhongyuan basin is a central ridge
running generally along its geographical centre line (Figure 1). To the east
of this ridge sediments attain their maximum thickness of 9000 meters. The
ridge itself is seen as an uplifted horst-block and its presence has caused
extensive longitudinal and also transverse faulting. Resulting structural
closure in faulted blocks along the flanks of this ridge acts as the
hydrocarbon trapping mechanism.
4.       Reservoirs are thin, lake deposited, Oligocene sands mostly 2-3
meters thick, only occassionally attaining a thickness of 9 meters. Their
horizontal consistency is poor and they are imbedded in gray clays and
mudstones, these probably being the source rock. At three levels salt/gypsum
layers have been encountered in the section, providing an additional seal. At
present only reservoirs below the top two of these salt layers have been
explored by drilling. Deeper prospecting in these fault blocks may also
encounter red sands and shales of Mesozoic-Early Tertiary age. Paleozoic
sediments were found when drilling at the basin edges. These consisted of
dense Ordovician carbonates with occasional oil and gas shows.
5.       In the Oligocene sands, locally named the Sa Her Jie Formation, oil
and gas has now been found in sixteen (16) structures (Figure 1). Of these,
four structures in the northern part of the basin have now been developed and
are currently producing. Production figures and reserve estimates for these
fields are shown in Table 1. Also shown are reserve estimates for a further
four structures, all in the Wenliu area of which South Wenliu is proposed for
development under this project.

6.       Evaluation and development of the structures is progressing from
north to south. On eight (8) structures in the central and southern part of
the basin oil and gas has also been found. Four of these finds were tested.
A number of structural closures found by seismic remain to be drilled and also
deeper prospects are yet to be explored.
7.       The South Wenliu structure consists of a number of faulted blocks in
which four levels of the Sa Her Jie Formation are to be developed. These
sands are situated in the S2 - S3 interval (Figure 2). The intention is to
produce only from the blocks found to contain oil and associated gas. Sands
with free natural gas will not be developed.
8.       The oil in place is to be reached by the development schedule, is
currently estimated at 47.81 million tons, together with 11 billion cubic
meters of associated gas. For this purpose 204 further wells will be drilled.
9.       The location of these wells has to be controlled by the pattern of
the subsurface faults as many of these were found to be influencing the fluid
levels in the reservoirs. For this reason a 3D seismic survey is currently
being conducted, hopefully leading to a sharper definition of the fault
locations. As the results of this survey will not become available before the
fourth quarter of 1983, it has been discussed with the Zhongyuan petroleum
development staff, to delay drilling of development wells in the vicinity of
faults, as they are presently known from seismic and appraisal wells.
10.      Since appraisal wells have been mainly drilled along lines across the
strucure and seismic coverage is also denser in this direction, longitudinal
faults are better known than transverse faults. It was thus proposed to
maintain a margin of only 75 meters from the longitudinal faults while keeping
a margin of 250 meters from the transverse faults. The remainder of the wells
(113) can be drilled prior to the interpretation of the 3D results. The
breakdown for each of the target sands is shown in Table 2.

Expected Production Forecast
1.       To date the field has not been produced except for tests.  At the
initial pressure of 5833 psi (393.9 atm) the reservoir is undersaturated.  By
the time the pressure reaches the bubble point at 3160 psi (215 atm) the
reservoir could produce by fluid and rock expansion an amount equivalent to 3%
to 5% of the original oil in place. Assuming that an equivalent volume will
be produced by gas expansion, approximately 8% to 10% of the original oil in
place would be produced before free gas begins to flow, reducing the oil flow
rate and rapidly depleting the reservoir of its main source of energy.
Recovery factors used to calculate primary reserves reflect the expected
effect of weak water drives and/or gravitational segregation present in the
different producing zones of each fault block. An overall recovery factor of
16.7% could be obtained from all fault blocks at abandonment pressure.
Improving Reservoir Performance
2.       Under the circumstances described, a pressure maintenance program by
water injection appears to be the most reasonable and economical way to
increase the recovery factor. This is confirmed by the apparent success of
the pressure maintenance observed in the Central Wenliu field. The production
and injection records for the WIO block waterflooding in this field were
reviewed. Stabilization of the pressure and production levels seems to have
been achieved, although signs of early water breakthrough are observed in
several wells.
3.       The frontal drive theory developed by Buckley and Leverett is the
basis for describing the mechanism of immiscible water displacement and its
validity has been confirmed by several mathematical and experimental studies
(see SPE Monograph Volume 3). The only data required to apply it are the
water-oil relative permeability relationships and the water and oil
viscosities, which made it particularly useful in the South Wenliu field.
Disregarding the formation dip effects, the fractional flow of water can be
expressed by:
/   1    +         FKro
Krw
where
+s j <0   =  viscosities of water and oil, respectively,
in centipoise
Krw, Kro    =  relative permeabilities to water and oil,
respectively
By means of the above equation and the average relative characteristics for
the two zones, the fractional flow curves on Fig. 1 have been constructed by
the Bank consultant (Core Laboratories). Average water saturations behind the
flood front at breakthrough (SW) are read from these curves as 72% and 75% for



- 61 -                           ANNEX 4.02
Page 2 of 7
S2 and S3 reservoirs respectively. Since the fractional recovery can be
determined from water saturations by:
Recovery = Sw    S       Swi
the theoretical recovery factor resulting from the relative permeability
characteristics of the zones would be:
R.F. (S2)  =  0.72 - 0.30  =  0.58
0.72
R.F. (S3)  =  0.75 - 0.39  =  0.47
0.75
An average value of 53% for recovery at breakthrough would be expected from
the two zones, without considering areal sweep efficiency or vertical
conformance.
Factors Affecting recovery Efficiency
4.       The theoretical recovery factors must be modified by two important
factors particular to every case: (1) areal sweep efficiency and (2)
reservoir heterogeneity. The areal sweep efficiency, or fraction of the water
flood pattern contacted by water at a given time depends upon the mobility
ratio, the geometric configuration of the flood pattern and the amount of
water injected into the pattern area. Several correlations presenting areal
sweep efficiency as a function of mobility ratio have been developed for
different geometrical well patterns. Figure 2 shows the curve of areal sweep
efficiency at breakthrough versus mobility ratio for a staggered line drive,
which can be expected to apply for the South Wenliu field. As can be observed
from this curve, sweep efficiencies above 75% can be obtained for mobility
ratios lower than unity. Mobility ratios in the S2 and S3 reservoirs are 0.44
and 0.89 respectively (see inset of Figure 2), considered very favourable and
yield areal sweep efficiency in the range of 76% to 84%. An adverse factor
for the areal sweep efficiency is the reservoir heterogeneity. Variations in
reservoir properties can be present on a real basis as a result of changes in
compaction, cementation and depositional environment among others, but for the
sandstones of the South Wenliu field these are minor as compared to vertical
changes. Several methods concerned with reservoir stratification have been
developed to predict waterflood performance (ch.8, SPE Monograph Vol.3); of
these the Kelton-Stiles method has been considered the most suitable to apply
in the South Wenliu field.
Rate and Recovery Forecast
5.       In the Kelton-Stiles method available permeability data are arranged
in decreasing order and the distribution of low capacity, Kh, is determined.
Permeability measurements from the cored wells, assuming the same length for
every sample, together with reservoir and fluid data for each group of sands
were used to make a computer run of the Kelton-Stiles calculation program.
The resulting watercut - recovery relationship and vertical conformance curves
are shown in Figure 3. The better performance of the waterflooding in the S2
reservoir is attributable to a more favourable mobility ratio and less
permeability variation. The recovery functions used to calculate the
production forecast assumed an areal sweep efficiency of 80%, and residual oil

ANNEX 4.02
Page 3 of 7
saturation of 20% and 15% (at 100% water flow) were used for the S2 and S3 pay
zones, respectively.
6.       Based on these data, 30-year forecasts were made.  Results are
presented in Table 1. Pressure maintenance was assumed by injecting in each
producing zone a volume of water equivalent to the expected initial daily oil
rate of 27 ton/well (204 BPD/well) for the S2 and 23 ton/well (174 BPD/well)
for the S3 reservoirs respectively. This would give a total injection rate of
22,073 BWPD, or an average of 345 BWPD for each of the 64 injection wells
programmed. Injection rates in excess of 600 BWPD have been maintained for
over a year in the waterflooding currently underway in the neighboring Central
Wenliu field, and no problem should be encountered in reaching the required
injection level in South Wenliu. According to these data, a maximum oil
production rate of 2912 tons/day (22073 STB/D) would be reached after an
assumed one-year buildup period. This rate could be maintained only two
years; after that water breakthrough would occur and oil production would
decrease steadily. The 30-year oil recovery of 16.522 million tons (125.24
MMSTB) is 34% of the initial oil in place (48.7 million tons). At the end of
30 years the watercuts in the S2 and S3 zones would be 81% and 94%
respectively.

Training for Skilled Workers and Professionals
A. Workers' Training
1.       The training center for Zhong Yuan should strive to provide the
training needed to assure that workers learn their particular jobs well. This
means training drilling crew personnel to do various jobs on a drilling rig.
The production workers, well servicing workers, loggers, cementers should be
taught the information and procedures they will apply in their particular
field of work.
2.       The training center for workers will be organized on the basis of
many short courses - 1 to 8 weeks - designed to meet specific objectives. The
training courses recommended by the consultants for the period of field
development (1983 - 1985) are designed with the idea teaching workers how to
work efficiently and safely in their jobs, how to properly care for the
equipment with which they work and must maintain.
3.       The attached recommended training programs (Appendix 1) are intended
to cover the training needs for most workers during the three-year period
intensive field development. These courses are given in two groups: (i)
basic training for inexperienced workers, or those entering a different field
of work; (ii) advanced training for experienced workers or for those entering
a specialized field such as instrumentation
B. Professional Training
1.       The number of professionals (petroleum engineers, geologists,
geophysicists) in the Zhong Yuan field are not sufficient to justify a
separate training center here. However, the professionals in this area still
need to be trained in order to perform their duties more efficiently and to
keep abreast with the fast developing technology in the petroleum industry.
They will be trained in the Shen Lli petroleum institute and other
universities in China. A certain percentage will be trained abroad in
specialized fields.

Notes on Financial Aspects
1.       ZPEB reports all exploration costs under the capital construction
account. MOPI finances the approved costs for exploration. In the event that
exploratory wells are turned into production wells, the latter are reported by
ZPEB in its balance sheet for production and are valued at the standard cost
in production wells.
2.       In addition to an annual investment and field maintenance budget,
ZPEB is required to prepare an annual operating budget based on the targets
set by MOPI. The target parameters focus mainly on production level, costs,
and net income, on a monthly, quarterly, and annual basis. The budget is
prepared in detail down to the level of brigade and is reviewed and
consolidated at the operating company and then at the bureau level. The
consolidated budget of ZPEB's overall operation is subject to the approval of
MOPI and review of MOF.
3.       For budgeting purposes, standard costing is applied.  Intercompany
transactions are priced at standard quantities and costs, while actual
quantities are reported by the cost centers which incur the expenses. Actual
costs are calculated at the bureau level and the variance between the actual
and standard costs are allocated to the various cost centers.
4.       ZPEB is required to transfer all net income and 50% of annual
depreciation to GOC. The balance of depreciation (50%) is retained by ZPEB
for field maintenance and renewal. Of the total contributions to the
Government, net income derived from investment funded by the Construction Bank
and 20% of annual depreciation are considered debt service on the Construction
Bank loan. ZPEB's projected contributions to Government over FYs82 through 86
are as follows:
