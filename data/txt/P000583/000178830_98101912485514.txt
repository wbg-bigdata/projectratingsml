COMOROS
APPRAISAL OF A COCONUT REHABILITATION AND RODENT CONTROL PROJECT
I. BACKGROUND
A. Proiect Background
1.01      The Project was identified by RMEA in April 1977.  Proposals to
rehabilitate the country's coconut plantations, to control the rodent popu-
lation and to improve processing and marketing of copra were prepared in
detail in the course of preparation missions in 1977 and 1978 by RMEA and
detailed proposals were presented to Government in November 1978. Project
processing was delayed as a result of a change of Government in May 1978.
In August 1979, IDA received a letter requesting appraisal of the Project.
The letter conveyed Government's general agreement on project issues. This
report is based on the findings of an IDA appraisal mission which visited the
Comoros in November 1979 composed of A. Levi, B. Mbida-Essama, R. Egli, A. De
Leva (IDA) and N. Kverno (Consultant). In large measure, the preparation
mission's Project proposals were maintained. During appraisal it was agreed
with Government that additional technical assistance would be included to
assist with the financial control of agricultural development projects.
1.02      This would be the first IDA Credit to the Comoros for an agricul-
tural project. Funds would be provided under the credit for the preparation
of a possible second agricultural project.
B. The Agricultural Sector
General
1.03      The Comoros Archipelago, located between the northern end of
Madagascar and the African mainland, consists of two large islands, Grande
Comore aVd Anjouan, and two 2smaller ones, Mayotte and Moheli. Total area is
2,166 km of which 1,040 km is cultivable land. The population of about
385,000 1/ is increasing at about 2.9% per year. Mayotte, with 13% of the
archipelago's population, remains under French administration. 2/ Given the
islands' poor resource endowment, all but Moheli are relatively highly
populated. The distribution and density of population per island are given
below:
1/ Based on extrapolation of the results of censuses held in 1958 and 1966.
2/   When possible, figures in this section will include Mayotte.

The two largest towns are Moroni, on Grande Comore (25,000) and Mutsamudu, on
Anjouan (16,000). These settlements are old Arab towns with attractive stone
houses, narrow streets and open markets. An estimated 85% of the population
live in small villages scattered irregularly across the islands depending on
the availability of land. Some have strongly built stone houses, but more
often houses are made of wooden frames with roof-and-sides thatched with
coconut fronds. The Comores is one of the 31 "least developed nations" with
per capita GDP estimated at US$160 in 1977. Per capita GDP declined from over
US$200 in 1974 as a consequence of events following independence and a drop
in foreign assistance.
1.04      The Comoros' geographic position makes transport difficult and
expensive. Its international trade and communications are constrained by long
distances to foreign markets and by the lack of a natural deepwater harbor for
oceangoing vessels, the latter necessitating the use of neighboring countries'
ports for transshipments, or the loading/unloading of ships offshore. The Comoros
have two ports, one on Grande Comore and one on Anjouan which can accommodate
small (400-500 tons) ocean going vessels. Larger vessels must anchor offshore
for loading and unloading, which is possible in calm weather only. Only small
vessels can approach the existing quays at Mutsamudu on Anjouan, and Moroni
on Grande Comore. Long-distance oceangoing ships must lie offshore and be
unloaded by dhow; during the cyclone season, this procedure is dangerous and
ships are reluctant to call at the islands. Most freight is first sent to La
Reunion where it is transshipped.
1.05      The archipelago is subject to a tropical marine climate, with the
season being determined mainly by the monsoon winds. Hot and humid weather,
brought in by the northeasterly monsoon between November and April, gives way
to a relatively cool, dry season for the remainder of the year, when the
prevailing wind comes from the southeast. The average monthly temperature
varies between 230 and 280 C on the coast and the average annual rainfall is
over 2,000 mm The highlands are distinctly cooler with temperatures averaging
19  C and rainfall averaging 2,500 mm.  As is usually the case with small
mountainous islands, there are a number of well defined micro-climates on



-3 -
each island; the windward sides of the islands (those facing west) are generally
wet with few dry months; the leeward sides are much drier. These drier areas
however receive at least 1,300 mm of rain per year.
1.06      The islands are all of relatively recent volcanic origin but each
has its distinct geological, topographic and climatic features which in turn
determine the vegetation. Grande Comore, the most recent of the islands, is
formed by two volcanos, one in the north and one in the south. The one in
the south rises to 2,361 m and is still active; the most recent lava flow
occurred in April 1977. The soils are shallow and the surface is rocky and
best suited to the cultivation of tree crops. Despite frequent rainfall,
particularly on the higher slopes, there are no perennial streams as the
soils are too thin and permeable to prevent the rapid seepage of surface
water into the volcanic rock. Anjouan is made up of three mountain chains
which stretch out from a central peak (1,575 m high) thereby forming three
well defined peninsulas. Anjouan is geologically older than Grande Comore and
has therefore developed deeper soils which support perennial streams.
However, as a result of overintensive cultivation, serious erosion has
occurred particularly on the southern peninsula. Moheli, the smallest island
ln the archipelago, has a central mountain chain which reaches 860 m at its
highest point. The hillsides are not particularly steep and the valleys are
wide and fertile. Estimated land use by island is as follows:

1.07      Agriculture dominates the Comorian economy.  About 80% of the
population live in rural areas and gain their livelihood from agriculture.
Agriculture contributes nearly 40% of GDP and practically all export earnings.
The average annual total value of merchandise exports in 1976-78 was US$10.1
million of which vanilla represented 35%, essence of ylang-ylang 28%, 1/ cloves
25% and copra 8%. The average value of imports for the same period was
US$17.8 million of which food represented 38%. The Comoros' agricultural
economy is, for the most part, comprised of smallholders who earn a meager
livelihood using traditional cultivation techniques. There are relatively
few large plantations and commercial production is limited to ylang-ylang.
Average farm size for the estimated 40,000 farm families is about 1.3 ha.
Farming techniques are based on hand labor using basic hand tools, the hoe,
1/   The essence of the ylang-ylang flower is used to fix fragances in the
manufacture of perfumes and soaps.

pick and machete. Fertilizers and improved seed are not used. The use of
hired labor on smallholdings is rare though a system akin to sharecropping is
prevalent on the larger holdings (para. 1.08). Nonagricultural services in
rural areas are poor; school and health centers are inadequate. Coastal ring
roads have been developed to paved standards on Anjouan and Grande Comore and
partially on Moheli because export crops are produced mainly along the
coastal strip. However, feeder roads penetrating the interior have been
neglected to a large extent.
Land Tenure
1.08      Three types of land holdings exist in the Comoros.  First there are
colonial company estates which have been partially developed as plantations
for export crops, particularly copra and ylang-ylang. In 1965 these occupied
about 20% of cultivable land but on Anjouan and to a lesser extent on Moheli
and Grande Comore these have been transferred in large part to, or in some
cases simply taken over by, small farmers. The Societe Bambao, which owns
about 2,800 ha on Moheli, 300 ha on Grande Comore and 400 ha on Anjouan is
the sole colonial company remaining in the Comoros. Second, another 15-20% is
owned by private individuals and a few local companies who have registered
holdings, the largest extends over 100 ha, but the majority average 25 ha.
Ownership of the remainder of the cultivable land is governed by very complex
laws. It is based on Koranic statutes and collective ownership transmitted by
the women of the family. A system similar to share-cropping has evolved on
both the company estates and private holdings whereby those who do not own
land or who want to augment their earnings harvest the crops, mostly coconuts
and ylang-ylang flowers, with the understanding that they will sell the
harvest to the land owner at a price that is fixed prior to harvest. The
system works reasonably well. All but 200 ha of the approximately 19,000
ha of forest land is owned by the State (para 1.12).
Agricultural Production
1.09      Major Crops.  Owing to its eco-climatic conditions which result from
variations in altitude and plentiful rainfall, the Comoros are well suited for
production of a wide range of crops. Along the coast, up to an altitude of
500 m, are found the trees which provide the main export crops: ylang-ylang,
cloves and coconuts. Coconut palm density averages 55 per ha compared
with 158 palms in pure coconut plantations, permitting extensive interplanting
with bananas, cassava, vanilla, cloves and some rice. Limited quantities of
papaya, avocado, coffee, cocoa, and breadfruit trees are also found in this
zone. Land above 500 m is used for the production of foodcrops: cereals,
beans, potatoes and other vegetables. Mountain rice is also widely grown in
some areas.  On the higher slopes, cultivation gives way to primary forest,
which is much degraded in areas close to human habitation. About 48% of the
land is under food or tree crops, 7% under pasture, 16% under forest and 29%
has no economic use.
1.10      Coconut is the Comoros' principal crop; it is a source of food and
drink, cooking oil, thatching material, wood and copra (para 2.01). Copra
represents the Comoros' fourth most imp

estimated 1.6 million trees occupying some 30,000 ha or 37% of the cultivated
land (16,500 ha on Grande Comore, 7,500 ha on Anjouan and 6,000 ha on Moheli).
The Comoros accounts for 56% of world production of ylang-ylang, Mayotte for
20% and Madagascar for the remaining 24%. The number of hectares planted with
the principle export crops and quantities exported in 1979 are summarized
below.

Yields of ylang-ylang may vary as a result of differences in soil fertility
and as a result, Anjouan produces almost twice as much essence as Grande
Comore and Mayotte. For the past three years, vanilla has been the Comoros'
most important export crop. In all there are about 14 million vanilla vines
occupying 4,190 ha, 11.5 million of which are on Grande Comore and 1.5 million
on Anjouan. The vanilla vines are generally grown under the shade of coconut
and other trees. The crop is cultivated almost entirely by small farmers.
Over the past three years, cloves have been the Comoros' third most important
export crop. Domestic rice production amounts to about 3,000 tons, or one
fifth of the quantity imported.  Rice is planted on about 7,500 ha over the
three islands.
1.11      Food crops.  The staple crops are cassava and pigeon peas, which are
grown at lower elevations, and rice and beans at higher elevations. The
possibilities of improving production of cassava are limited because of the
shallowness of-the soil, but some increase in yields could be achieved through
the introduction of sound, high yielding planting material and fertilizer.
There is good potential for increasing production of pigeon peas through the
introduction of better varities. Upland rice is grown on the prevailing light
permeable soil at higher elevations. However, due to limited land and the
demonstrated ability to get better yields with maize, it would be better to
replace rice with maize. The European Development Fund (FED) is currently
financing a project which aims to increase maize production and replace rice
with maize but before this goal can be achieved, long established food habits
would have to change (para 1.19). Beans could be intercropped with maize
resulting in significant increases in bean production.
1.12      Forestry.  The following table, taken from two surveys, one completed
in 1968 and the other in 1974, shows the rapid rate of deforestation which is



-6-
taking place in the Comoros. Steps have been taken to plant new forests but
to date the area reforested covers less than ?3,000 ha.  The 1974 survey
estimated annual wood consumption to be 2.5 m per person, approximately
double the estimate for East Africa, nine-tenths of which is consumed as
domestic firewood. There is only one significant industrial forestry operation
at Kartala on Grande Comore. This scheme supplies 4,000 m of construction
wood annually from the natural forest of the Kartala. It is estimated that
the Comoros' present domestic firewood needs could be met on a sustained
basis from 33,000 ha of eucalyptus plantation, equivalent to 15% of the
total surface area of the archipelago, whereas to obtain such a supply from
the natural forest would require an area of forest seven times as large.

1.13      Fisheries.  The coastal water surrounding the Comoros Archipelago,
with the exception of Mayotte's coral lagoon, are not rich in fish. The
fishery potential is estimated to be 6,500 tons per annum, of which 3,500
would come from the Mayotte lagoon.  Within a radius of 50 km of the archi-
pelago there is a tuna potential of approximately 20,000 tons per annum, half
of which could be accessible to small motorized fishing boats. About 3,500
Comorians from 140 coastal villages are engaged in fishing, using approximately
2,500 outrigger canoes costing anywhere from US$100-$400. Only 3% are equipped
with outboard motors; the remainder depend on sails or are rowed. Using
either lines or nets, a canoe team catches an average of 15 kg a day and makes
100 sorties a year. Motorized boats are able to catch three times as much.
Because of strong winds, fishing is possible only 200 days a year at most.
Most of the fish is eaten by the population on the coast and little reaches
the inland villages.  The African Development Fund (AfDF) is currently prepar-
ing a fisheries project.
1.14      Livestock.  Animal husbandry is not a major activity in the Comoros,
mainly because of difficulties in supplying water and food to the livestock
population. In all there are some 40,000 cattle, 50,000 goats and 4,000
sheep with over 50% of the livestock located on Grande Comore. Despite these
small numbers there are already 1.35 livestock units per ha of pasture,
over twice the recommended stocking rate.  The offtake from the small herds is
low, and the average per capita consumption of meat has been estimated at no
more than 5 kg per annum. The deficit is partly made up by meat imports.



-7-
Marketing, Processing and Prices
1.15      An estimated 30% of total food crop production is marketed through
commercial channels. Local markets are entirely in private hands, market
facilities are limited and prices are determined by supply and demand. There
are significant seasonal fluctuations in price levels for maize and rice.
Food crops move easily from one coastal area to another because of the
well-developed coastal road systems. Because of the poor state of feeder
roads, however, particularly on Grande Comore, surplus production of fish and
coconuts seldom reaches the interior. Foodcrop marketing is restricted by
the relatively small demand from the scattered towns and cities, and by poorly
developed storage systems. The Government sets importer mark-ups on goods of
primary necessity such as rice, sugar, salt, flour, oil, and meat. The price
of bread is also controlled. Marketing networks for export crops, particularly
ylang-ylang, cloves, vanilla and copra are dominated by five principal trading
families, four of whom have been operating in the Comoros since the beginning
of the 20th century. The flower of the ylang-ylang is distilled on the
islands to obtain the ylang-ylang essence; copra is dried either in kilns or
in the sun and the green vanilla bean is processed using traditional methods
prior to export. About 200 tons of copra are processed into oil to supply a
small soap factory on Grande Comore. For the moment there is no clear Govern-
ment pricing policy as regards cashcrop exports. In the past, the Government
has intervened in the marketing of ylang-ylang by buying up flowers and
destroying them in order to preserve the price. For the 1979 campaign, a
floor price for vanilla was fixed and a price stabilization mechanism was set
up. The Government is planning to set up price stabilization funds for the
four major export crops: ylang-ylang, vanilla, cloves and copra, which it
plans to have in operation by mid-1981 (paras. 2.12 and 7.01). Marketing and
prices for livestock products and fish are, like food crops, determined by
market forces.
Development Problems and Government Plans
1.16      Since independence in 1975 there has been little opportunity for
planning and development. The turmoil that accompanied the achievement of
independence was followed by the withdrawal of French aid and a period
of radical social experiments during which the civil service was dismissed and
replaced by youth seeking swift and revolutionary change in the social and
institutional structure of the country. The Government's problems were
aggravated by the precipitious return of over 18,000 Comorians from Madagascar
in early 1977 and the eruption of the Kartala volcano that same year. The
present Government came to power in June of 1978. The political situation
appears to be stabilizing, and the Government is beginning to reflect on a
strategy of development. UNDP has asked the Bank Group to be the executing
agency for a planning assistance program it is financing in the Comores.
1.17      The major challenge for the Comoros is to increase the income levels
of its people through increased agricultural production. The problems facing
Comoros agriculture are numerous. Although the country has generally fertile
soils and a favorable climate, the potential for agricultural development is
limited both by institutional and policy constraints and by pressure on land



- 8 -
resources from the growing population. Institutions dealing with agriculture
are just developing and are generally short of trained staff. Donor financed
projects represent the bulk of the activities of the Ministry of Production
and Agro-Industries. At present there is no service to monitor and control
budgets and disbursements and reimbursement payments received on behalf of
these projects. The competition for land has led to overgrazing, overcropping
and the exploitation of marginal or unsuitable land and resulting erosion.
The country's forest resources have been seriously depleted as a result of the
ever-increasing demand for fuelwood and timber.
1.18      In the elaboration of a development strategy for the Comoros, four
principle issues stand out: improvement of agriculture, provision of better
infrastructure, energy, and the explosive growth of the population. The first
comprises a wide array of sub-issues including the expansion of food crops,
notably increasing the cultivation of maize in lieu of importing rice and
increasing fishing and small livestock production, the further development of
export crops and the improvement of institutions which regulate export crop
production, reforestation, the regularization of land rights and redistribu-
tion of large landholdings (particularly on Moheli) and the prevention of
further soil erosion. On the infrastructure side, the improvement of feeder
roads and island port facilities are prerequisites for further development.
The exploitation of Grande Comore's geothermal resources is of high priority
for industrial development and the reduction of the country's energy bill.
Population growth must be addressed because if present trends continue, the
population is estimated to reach 415,000 by 1990 and 472,000 by the year 2,000
(para. 2.09). The resultant pressure on arable land and the forestry resources
must be analyzed. The translation of these broad development issues into an
investment program which will attract and optimize external resources requires
a capacity to plan and implement specific projects which the Government is
acquiring gradually, primarily through donor financed development projects.
IDA should maintain a dialogue on all issues affecting agricultural develop-
ment through sector work and as part of Project supervision.
1.19      There are three principal on-going agricultural development projects
under the Ministry of Production and Agro-Industries, hereafter referred
to as the Ministry of Production: a Smallholder Maize project financed by
FED, a Vanilla and Cloves Improvement project financed by AfDF and the Rural
Development Centers Program (CEFADER, CADER) financed by UNDP. Given the
smallness of the Comoros and the fact that intercropping in coconut plantations
is the general farming pattern, all projects in the agricultural sector are
interrelated. It is most important that effective coordination among these
various programs and projects be assured. This coordination should be handled
principally by the Director of Agriculture working through the Rural Development
Centers Program (paras. 1.23 and 1.24).
C. Government Services
1.20      Background.  From 1963 to 1974, responsibility for managing the
various agriculture projects financed by France was entrusted to a parastatal
organization called Societe de Developpement Economique (SODEC) with technical



- 9 -
assistance provided by the French state enterprise, Bureau pour le Developpement
de la Production Agricole (BDPA). Under this system, the role of the Ministry
responsible for agriculture was modest. Over the years, SODEC was mismanaged
and after a decade of failure its activities were discontinued in 1974.
Responsibility for project implementation was given to the newly created
services in the Ministry of Production. Owing to the departure of French
technicians at the end of 1975 and the acute shortage of funds for operational
expenditures, most activities of the Ministry came to a halt in 1975.
Only an independent French research organization which had been working in
-         the Comoros since 1964, the Institut de Recherches Agronomiques Tropicales
(IRAT), maintained its activities through 1976. In 1977, the few agricultural
field stations that were maintained after France withdrew its support were
occupied by the Army. When the present Government took over, agricultural
services were barely existent. Most of the civil service had been dismissed,
documents had been burned and demonstration plots had disappeared.
1.21      Ministry of Production and Agro-Industries (Chart 1).  The Ministry
is responsible for direction and coordination of all activities in the agri-
culture sector. Under the Minister are three departments, one for agricul-
tural development, one for forestry and a third for agro-industries which
includes fisheries. The Ministry employs about 120 people, 80 of whom are
extension staff. There are 41 extension workers on Grande Comore, 24 on
Anjouan and 17 on Moheli all of whom are to receive training at the newly
created CADERS (para 1.23). The Director of Agriculture is responsible for
three services, one for plant production, one for livestock and a third
which oversees the Rural Development Centers Program (para. 1.23). He
also oversees all agricultural research and training activities. The Director
of Agro-Industrial Development is responsible for two services, one for
fisheries and a second for small industries.
1.22      The new constitution, approved in late 1978, provides for a federal
association of the three islands with a large degree of autonomy for each
island to provide basic services. In harmony with the constitution, rural
development services are offered at two different levels, a federal level where
planning, documentation, basic research, budgeting and donor coordination
takes place, and the local or island level where field demonstrations and
various development projects are implemented. Given the smallness of the
Comoros, its limited resource base and trained manpower, the Government has
opted for a system of agricultural services which aims to utilize its modest
means efficiently (paras 1.23 and 1.24).
1.23      The Rural Development Centers Program.  The Ministry of Production,
with substantial assistance from UNDP and FAO, is in the process of
expanding its agricultural services (para 1.19). The first phase of a two
phase program which aims to set up a Centre Federal d'Appui au Developpement
Rural (CEFADER) on Grande Comore and at least one Centre d'Appui au Developpe-
ment Rural (CADER) on each of the three islands began in early 1980. The
CEFADER would include one station at M'De for research, trials, pilot programs
and training and one at Moroni, which will include offices, a quality control
laboratory, a conditioning station and storage facilities. The CADER, working



- 10 -
through the three line departments under the Director General of the Depart-
ment of Rural Development of the Ministry of Production (para 1.21) are to
serve as the nuclei of development activities (i.e., maize production,
reforestation, breeding small livestock, anti-erosion control works, seed
multiplication and farmer and extension staff training) in their immediate
areas. During the first stage, four CADER are planned: two on Grande Comore,
one at Simboussa and one at Maoueni; one on Anjouan at M'Remani and one on
Moheli at Mibani. In addition, the possibility of establishing two additional
support centers, one at St. Benoit on Grande Comore and a second at Pmooni on
Anjouan, will be studied. Initially each support CADER will cover from twenty
to twenty-five villages. Most of the locations were agricultural stations in
the past and therefore they will not have to be built from scratch.
1.24      The CEFADER will be directed by a council of 15 members nominated by
the Prime Minister after consultation with the Minister of Production.
The council will include the Minister of Production (president), seven heads
of the Ministry's technical services, three representatives of the Island's
Governors, one representative of the Ministry of Finance, and three elected
Deputies, one from each island. According to decree the council must meet at
least once a year to review annual work plans, budgets and the annual report.
During the year, it delegates the responsibility for day to day management of
the CEFADER's financial affairs to a committee of three nominated by the
Minister of Production and technical matters to the CEFADER Director and his
deputy. The Committee of three will report to the Minister's cabinet and the
CEFADER Director and will coordinate their work with the three line Depart-
ments of the Ministry. The CADERs will be directed by a council of seven
members nominated by the Minister of Production after consultation with the
Governors of each island. Member will include the Island Commissioner for
Production (president), three technicians nominated by the Governor on the
recommendation of the CEFADER and two representatives of the Producers.
As with the CEFADER, the council must meet at least once a year to review
progress and approve the budget. The Council delegates day to day management
responsibility for financial matters to a committee of three nominated by the
Governor and for technical matters to the Director of each CADER. As with the
CEFADER, financial matters will be controlled by the Minister's cabinet and
technical matters by the three line departments of the Ministry.
1.25      The CEFADER and CADER operations are just beginning and it is too early
to judge their effectiveness. The aim of decentralizing rural services and
using limited human and physical resources to the fullest extent possible is
sound. The success of the system will depend in large part on the ability of
the CEFADER, CADER operating personnel to coordinate effectively with personnel
from the Ministry of Production. This cooperation should be facilitated by
the fact that 50% of the council members of the CEFADER are from the Ministry
and all the council members of the CADERs would be nominated by the Minister
of Production.
1.26      Research.  Over the period 1966-75, IRAT embarked on the preparation
of detailed soil, land capability, and land use maps for the four islands.
These are now complete and comprehensive practical proposals have been
prepared for modifying actual land use for one of the islands, Anjouan.
During this period IRAT also carried out fixed trials to determine the



- il -
optimum cultivation systems and cropping patterns for different soils, topo-
graphy and micro-climates, and to test crop varieties best suited to Comorian
conditions. The new CEFADAR station at M'De will build on IRAT's extensive
work (para 1.23).
1.27      Agricultural Credit.  The Comoros is a member of the French Franc
area and as such the convertibility of its currency, the CFA franc, is
guaranteed by France. There is only one commercial bank in the Comoros, the
Banque des Comores (BC). The Bank is a corporate body with an assembly of
shareholders, a Board of Directors, and a Managing Director. Banking functions
are also performed by the Comorian Treasury and the Postal Savings System.
There is no formal agricultural credit system. The BC finances cash crop
exports and seasonal working capital needs of traders in agricultural commo-
dities to a limited extent but only 5% of its loans is for this type of
activity. It does not extend credit to farmers. The Comorian Government is
presently studying a proposal to revive a national development bank which
would function along the lines of the Societe de Credit pour le Developpement
des Comores (CREDICOM), a development bank which was established in 1974 with
assistance from the French Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique (CCCE)
but ceased operating in 1977. Its priorities have yet to be announced but it
will certainly play some role in extending agricultural credit.
II. THE COCONUT SUBSECTOR
General
2.01      The coconut is the Comoros' principal agricultural staple.  Its intro-
duction into the Comoros dates back to the early arrival in the area of Arab
traders in the 15th century (para. 1.09). Roughly one-third of total coconut
production is destroyed by rodents, one half is consumed locally and the
remaining 16% is transformed into copra for export. Distribution of coconut
cultivation by island is presented below:
Island                  Cultivable Land        Coconuts       %    No of trees

It is estimated that about 70% of the palm stand is over 50 years old.
Unless these trees are replaced over the next several years, yields will
decline significantly (see Table 7). 1/
Plant Characteristics
2.02      The palms grown in the Archipelago are of the "tail" variety,
probably belonging to the Indian type coconut palm. The planting material
is quite uniform. The average annual yield per palm is estimated at 46 nuts.
This is a relatively high yield compared with palms grown in other countries
under similar cultural methods (39 nuts per palm in Sri Lanka and 29 in
Malaysia). On average the nuts contain about 200 grams of fresh albumen which
yields 180 grams of copra. About 5.5 nuts are required for one kilogram of
copra. The palms on all three islands are healthy. On the western coasts,
where rainfall tends to be highest, growth is luxuriant. The palms are deep
green and show no visible symptoms of any deficiency of major nutrients. On
the eastern coasts, the effects of temporary drought are apparent. The leaves
are less dense, and in certain areas their yellow-orange color indicates a
deficiency of nitrogen and possibly manganese.
Types of Plantations
2.03      A survey taken as a part of an Institut des Recherches pour les
Huiles et Oleagineux (IRHO) 2/ study shows three general planting patterns as
indicated below:
100 or more          70-100                 20-70
palms per ha      palms per ha           palms per ha      Total
No. of ha          6,200                11,200              12,600          30,000
% of total          20                    37                   43              100
Plantations with 100 palms per ha are the classic industrial plantation with
well aligned palms and well tended soil. As seen above, they represent only a
small percentage of the palm acreage. These plantations are found mostly on
Moheli where land is relatively plentiful.  The original plantations were
established with a planting distance of 10 x 10 m (100 trees per ha) and
have never been replanted or interplanted. Industrial plantations where palms
are intercropped with other perennial crops are found in areas with good rain-
fall. In these areas trees average 70 palms per ha. Trees are aligned and
interplanted with ylang-ylang, cloves and sometimes vanilla. There does not
1/   The life of a coconut palm is estimated at 70 years.  Production usually
begins declining after year 60.

possibilites de developpement," 1971.

appear to be any nutritional competition between these crops and palm yields
are the same as in pure stands. The small farmer plantation is the most
common type of exploitation. Here tree density averages 55 per ha but can be
as low as 20. The small farmers put emphasis on food production - cassava,
rice, pigeon peas and some vegetables. The palm is considered a secondary
crop which provides cash income. This type of land use is probably the most
efficient under present circumstances. It provides year-round cover for
the soil which prevents erosion. Intercropping usually assures that planta-
tions are kept clean. Plantations with high undergrowth are found only in
Moheli; these are either neglected industrial plantations or smallholdings
with more land than can be planted to food crops with available labor.
Fertilizer Use
2.04      Fertilizers have never been used for coconut palms on the Comoros.
The technical use of fertilizers is complex because of the physical character
of the soils and the effects on the crops which are usually intercropped with
the coconut trees. Cost, procurement and distribution are other factors.
The farmers have thus far considered coconuts only as a secondary source of
income. Their present return, in most cases, would not justify the use of
fertilizer. Agricultural services are not equipped to buy and distribute
fertilizers and no private merchants deal in fertilizers.
Pests
2.05      Damage caused by rodents is the major pest problem in coconut
plantations on the Comoros. Extensive surveys were under taken by IRHO in
1968 which consisted of counting damage to fallen nuts from samples of 100
trees at 21 locations on the three islands over two months. Losses to rodents
were estimated at 37% of annual production. Thus, out of 46 nuts that a palm
produces, on average, 17 are destroyed by rodents. In these surveys, the
highest damage was recorded on Moheli, 47%, followed by Anjouan, 43%, and
Grande Comore, 30%.
2.06      Several major rodent control campaigns have been conducted in the
Comoros but, with the exception of the most recent campaign financed in 1972,
no information regarding total area treated, application procedures or impact
remains. The 1972 campaign was to be the beginning of a six year project
designed to achieve and maintain low rodent populations on all palm planta-
tions of the Comoros. The program was to cost US$520,000, 41% of which was to
go to pay for prepared imported baits. The campaign began on Moheli. There
were six crews of six men each employed in the operation. Each crew member was
to cover a band of 100 m and was instructed to place baits at ground level
of every fourth palm. Only areas having coconut trees were baited; villages
were bypassed. At the end of the first month the program ran into difficulty.
The crews were poorly supervised and there was no system of accountability or
cheeking to see if the baits had been placed as planned. The farmers were not
associated with the implementation of the campaign and the costs of the baits
exceeded estimates by a large margin. The campaign was called off at the end
of the second month. Banding of palm trunks with strips of galvanized metal



- 14 -
intended to create rat barriers has been tried in several areas. However, the
bands have not been maintained and the system has its limitations as vegeta-
tion often provides a bridge to the palms above the bands.
2.07      Aside from rodents, there are no pests or diseases of economic
importance. Oryctes is present but causes insignificant damage. There are
scale insects and some localized attack of Pestalozzia palmarum, but these
attacks are limited and do not warrant any control measures.
Production Trends and Utilization
2.08      The maximum value for coconuts in the Comoros is in their utilization
for food, drink and oil. Nuts for copra production are secondary and only
those surplus to their primary uses are transformed into copra. There are
marked differences in the production, utilization and marketing of coconuts
on the three islands. The following tables provide a summary of availability
and domestic utilization of nuts by the islands.

Comparing Coconut Production with total nuts consumed it can be seen that in
1980 there is a near shortage for consumption on Anjouan and a considerable
surplus on Moheli.
2.09      As summarized below, if a serious program of replanting and new
planting is not begun in the near future, the Comoros will not only lose
its export of copra but, more important, by 1986, face a shortage of coconuts
for consumption. 1/

Marketing and Pricing
2.10      Market values of nuts and copra for the three islands (Nov. 1979) is
given below:

There is no organized system for marketing of fresh nuts.  There is some
movement of nuts from the coastal areas to the higher zones in the interior
where palm trees do not grow and also to the principal towns but this is
not significant. Nuts are usually transported by local taxi in 60 kg sacks
for between 300 and 500 FCFA per trip. Due to the high cost of inter-island
transport, there is very little movement of fresh nuts between islands.
2.11      Copra is obtained from small farmers who dry the coconut meat,
either in kilns or in the sun.  Copra marketing is organized by five principal
private trading groups: The Bambao Company, Kalfane, SOCOPRO, Ahamadaly and
Abdahhal Fils. Under the present system, these traders advance funds to
collectors who purchase copra from producers and transport it at their own
expense to the capital of each island where it is stored by the trader until
it is exported. Because of lack of storage facilities at the village level,
producers prefer to sell their copra in sacks of from 60-65 kg as soon
as it is dry. The collector usually gets between 5 and 8 FCFA per kg for his
efforts which, given the general lack of transport facilities, particularly
on Moheli, seems reasonable. He exercises some degree of quality control by
rejecting spoiled copra. The exporters interviewed indicated a willingness
to buy directly from the producer and pay a premium if they were assured of
getting five to 10 tons of copra at a time. Due to its location and commercial
links that have been built up over the years, about 80% of Comoros copra is
sold to Madagascar whose yearly demand, about 3,000 tons, exceeds the
Comoros' supply. The price structure for copra as of November 1979 is given
in the following table.
1/   Price for copra at the farmgate varies between 55 FCFA and 65 FCFA per kg.
5.5 nuts are equivalent to 1 kg of copra.

The average FOB price received in 1979 was 118 FCFA/kg. Thus the producer
received about 51% of the export price.
2.12      Over the years, price volatility in the Comoros' main exports led
the Government to set up various stabilization funds (Caisses de Stabilisation)
for vanilla, ylang-ylang and copra. These funds have been applied to short
term problems such as the purchase of large quantities of ylang-ylang flovers
to diminish the amount of ylang essence on the market but for the most part,
they have played a very limited role in stabilizing prices. The reserves that
have been built up have been kept at the Treasury. They have generally not
been used to improve production of the crop from which they were collected or
to finance activities of the Ministry of Production. The Government is nov
considering creating a permanent Caisse de Stabilisation which would cover
vanilla, cloves, copra, ylang-ylang and cinnamon. Floor prices would be set
annually for crops covered by the fund and the utilization of fund resources
would be clearly set out. The Government intends to have the funds structure
in place by January 1981 and for the fund to be fully operational by June 1981
(para 7.01).
1/   Export duty is 6% FOB Moroni.  The average FOB value for 1979 was 118
FCFA/kg so the export duty equals 7.1 FCFA/kg.

Copra Processing
2.13      Nearly all coconut farmers produce some copra and for many farmers
copra sales are the only source of cash. Both sun-dried and kiln-dried copra
is produced. The quality is generally mediocre. Copra can be dried in the
sun from three to seven months of the year, depending on weather conditions
which vary from zone to zone. Copra is usually sun-dried on village roads as
no facilities exist for sun drying elsewhere. During the night it is taken
inside. Most of the kilns for drying copra are quite primitive. Small
farmers dry copra on the open fire. Larger farmers use thatch covered facil-
ities which produce a copra permeated by smoke.
2.14      Singhalese type kiln structures, made of stone and concrete with
corrugated tin roofs and openings at the front and rear to permit intake of
cold air and the outflow of smoke, were introduced in the Comoros about 20
years ago. The Ministry of Agriculture provided the construction materials
to groups that requested kilns and interested farmers provided the labor.
Hovever, ownership arrangements were not worked out prior to construction and
in most cases, only farmers who participated in the construction were entitled
to use the kilns. Over the years, the farmers who originally built the kilns
have moved or died and the rights to use them have not been transferred. As a
result, most of the kilns are in varying states of decomposition due to lack
of use and maintenance. The few kilns that are still operating do not provide
alats over the openings to control the intake of air and result in a loss
of fuel and only average quality copra (para. 3.05).
2.15      An unknown quantity of copra is wasted because of poor drying
methods and deterioration which occurs before the drying process begins.
0Often nuts are split open just after harvest to empty the milk and thus reduce
their weight, increasing the carrying capacity of the farmer. Lapses of up to
two days can occur between the opening of the nuts and the first application
of heat.
2.16      Sun-dried copra, which is used in the manufacture of confectionery
goods as vell as for religious ceremonies in some countries, can command a
higher price on the world market than kiln dried copra. Due to an absence of
quality control and the fact that sun-dried copra is not presently separated
from the kiln-dried, there is no incentive for exporters to seek markets
for sun-dried copra.
2.17      Future Programs and Policies.  The coconut is ubiquitous on
the Comoros and so much a part of everyday life that there is a tendency to
take its existence for granted. The present Government has become increas-
ingly aware of the need to control the significant damage caused by rodents,
rehabilitate the existing stand and increase the efficiency of copra proces-
sing and marketing so as to guarantee sufficient quantities of nuts for local
consumption and maintain a surplus of copra export. Two principal issues
must be addressed in regard to the coconut sub-sector. The first is the
land tenure question. This is particularly important for Moheli which has the
greatest long-run potential for increased copra production. Presently about



- 19 -
55% of the Island's coconut plantations are owned by private companies which,
because of high labor costs, cannot exploit their holdings optimally (para.
2.03). The second issue is pricing. Present prices for Copra are strong and
indications are that they will remain so for the next five or six years. However,
there is a need to insure the producer against wide price fluctuations for
copra as well as for the other major export crops. The Goverument recognizes
the need to define a coherent set of policies in regard to these two issues.
It intends to create a national Caisse de Stabilisation fund by June 1981
(para. 2.12), and define a land tenure plan for Moheli over the next 18
months. IDA would continue the dialogue it has begun on these two issues and
on all issues affecting coconut development as a part of Project supervision
(para 7.01).
III. THE PROJECT
A. General Description
3.01      The proposed Project, to be carried out over five years, would
extend and improve coconut and copra production in the three islands of Grande
Comore, Anjouan and Moheli through rodent control, increased productivity of
the existing stands from replanting and new planting, and improvement of
copra processing and marketing. It would further Government's objectives of
satisfying present and future domestic consumption demands, and augmenting
foreign exchange earnings from exports of good quality copra (para. 2.17). It
would, in addition, contribute to Government efforts to improve financial
management of agriculture development projecte. The proposed Project would
comprise the following components:
(a) Establishment of a rodent control unit for each island which,
over the life of the Project, would treat 8,000 ha: 2000 ha
each on Grande Comore and Anjouan and 4,000 ha on Moheli;
(b) Creation of a Copra Processing and Marketing Service which
would monitor the construction of improved drying and storage
facilities and work with farmers to improve the quality of
copra;
(c) Establishment of seed gardens and nurseries on each
island for the production of high yielding plant material
for replanting and new planting;
(d) Project management and administrative services;
(e) Overseas training for key Project personnel and on-the-
job training for Project staff;
(f)  Technical assistance for Project implementation and to the
Financial and Administrative Unit within the Ministry of
Production; and



- 20 -
(g)  Studies, field trials and monitoring and evaluation of
Project progress.
3.02      The Ministry of Production would have principal responsibility for
Project implementation. The chief of the Coconut Production Service, the
Project manager, would have day-to-day responsibility for Project
implementation. This service would continue to function after completion of
the Project, insuring the continuation of the 12 year plant improvement
program begun under the Project.
B. Detailed Features
Rodent Control
3.03      About 8,000, ha., 4000 on Moheli and 2,000 each on Anjouan and Grande
Comore are scheduled for rodent control under the Project. This has been
calculated as follows:

year 2. In year 3, these are added to the 1,400 ha maintained during
year 2 for a total of 2,500 ha to be maintained on Moheli in year 3.



- 21 v
3.04      Organized rodent control in the Comoros has, for the most part not
been very successful due to a lack of farmer involvement (para 2.06).
A joint program in which both farmers and Government officials would partici-
pate is recommended under the proposed Project. Project Management would
develope rodent control procedures, provide the rodenticide (anticoagulant),
prepare the bait and, working closely with farmers, provide guidance and
supervision on its application (para 4.06). The farmers would supply the food
carrier (copra) for the bait and provide the labor for its application.
Project staff would introduce the concept of rodent control to the farmers
through a village campaign (phase 1) which would be followed by a plantation
campaign (phase 2). The Rodent Control Unit would produce slide shows and
possibly short films to educate farmers. All farmers contacted during Project
appraisal indicated that rodents constitute a major problem in their villages.
They reported that rodents would run across them and their families while they
were sleeping and on occasion would bite their toes. Phase I would begin at
the village level where the problem is most pressing. Results should be
immediate as dwellings within each village are close together and rodent
population densities there are at their highest. By working with the villagers
prior to the campaign, it should be possible to make certain that children and
domestic animals are not endangered. 1/ The village level campaign should
last about one month. Following the campaign, expanding the concept into the
adjacent palm plantations, phase Il, should be relatively simple (para 4.06).
Copra Marketing and Processing
3.05      To help alleviate the shortage of adequate copra drying installa-
tions and storage facilities, provision would be made under the Project for
the construction of kilns, drying areas and storage facilities. A total of 19
drying kilns would be built, 10 on Moheli, five on Grande Comore and four on
Anjouan. Costs included under the Project include cement, brick, tin roofing
and screening needed to build the kilns and to pay for specialized skills of
masons and carpenters required. The kilns would be owned and operated by the
villagers who would provide the unskilled labor for their construction (para.
4.08). The approximate locations of the new kilns are shown on the Project
maps (IBRD Nos. 14833-35). The kilns would be a variation of the Singhalese-
type kiln and would each be contained in a small building consisting of a
screen platform on which the copra rests about 1.2 m above the ground, a
corrugated tin roof, wooden slats which serve as vents and a veranda. The
kiln is fueled by empty nut shells lit in the hearth under the grating. Each
kiln would have the capacity of about 2,000 nuts or about one third of a ton
per drying. It generally takes four to five days to dry copra in a kiln.
1/   To minimize exposure to nontarget species, treated bait in villages
would be presented in limited-access-containers made from whole coconuts
(diagram 1). These units would virtually eliminate access by chickens,
goats and domestic animals. Rodents, due to the size of the opening,
could gain access and children could insert their hands into the bait
chamber. In order to protect children from the ill effects of the bait,
barriers limiting their access to the room where a bait container is
located would be introduced (para 5.03). In addition, an additive dye
would be mixed with the bait so if a child were to eat the bait the dye
would remain on their face and hands. Supplies of vitamin K1, an antidote,
would be left at each village.



- 22 -
3.06      In order to encourage sun-drying, about 24 Copra drying areas
would be constructed 10 each on Moheli rnd Grande Comore and four on Anjouan.
These areas would cover a total of 60 m per village and be made of stone and
concrete.   Each area would be able to handle about 3,000 nuts or half a ton
per load. It generally takes six days to sun dry copra. During the night the
copra must be removed from the platform and placed indoors.
3.07      A total of 29 storage houses, each 40 m  and with a capacity of 10
tons, would be built, 10 on Moheli, 15 on Grande Comore and four on Anjouan.
Drying kilns, drying areas and storage houses would be built at the same
location wherever possible. Project staff would work closely with village
elders to determine the exact location of these facilities. Criteria for site
selection would include density of palms stands and the villagers' willingness
to participate in building the facilities and draw up a plan indicating how
they intend to manage the facilities (para 4.08). Slide shows and possibly
films would be prepared by the Copra Marketing and Processing Officer to
illustrate correct harvesting and drying methods.
Plant Improvement
3.08      Palms would be produced for each of the three principal growing
areas: the less favorable growing areas with stony soils and or dry weather
conditions; fertile areas where palms are interplanted with other tree crops;
and fertile areas where pure coconut plantations are found. For the less
fertile areas, nuts from good palms of the native Tall type, the Selected
Comorian tall, (CT-Sel) would be used. For fertile areas with intercropping
CT-Sel palms would be crossed in seed gardens with pollen from Tall palms from
outside the Archipelago which have a proven high-yield potential such as the
West African Tall. The resulting seed will be a CT-Sel x T cross. A portion of
the area might also be planted with seed nuts produced by crossing CT-Sel with
Malaysian Dwarf pollen material, subject to investigation by the coconut
improvement specialist. For fertile areas with pure plantations or where pure
plantations could be started, CT-Sel palms would be crossed in special seed
gardens with Malaysian Dwarfs (MD). The Malaysian Dwarfs would be grown from
seedlings in nurseries to be established on Moheli. The resulting seed would
be a CT-Sel x MD hybrid. During the five year Project period, the basic
structures for the breeding and seedling production program would be estab-
lished. During this period it is estimated that 244,000 CT-Sel and 48,000
CT-Sel x T seedlings would be produced. No CT-Sel x MD seed would be produced
from the seed gardens established during the Project period as it would take
six years for the palms resulting from the imported Malayan Dwarf seed nuts to
begin to bear fruit. Over a period of 12 years from the beginning of the
Project it is estimated that 1.6 million seedlings would be produced, enough
gradually to replace about 70% of the existing palms and to increase the
density of some existing stands. Technical aspects of seed garden and nursery
development are described in paras 5.05-5.10. The principal feature would be
establishment of seed gardens and nurseries on each island. Infrastructure
required would be fencing, small buildings for storing tools and senior staff
housing. The principal investments would be for seed gardens and nursery
costs (labor, seed, planting, hand tools and equipment); development of
infrastucture, buildings and fencing, and operating and maintenance costs
during the Project period.

Prolect ManaRement
3.09      The Project Director, the chief of the Coconut Production Service,
would be headquartered at M'De near Moroni. Provision is made for the
construction of Project Headquarters at M'De to include offices and housing.
Vehicles and equipment would be provided to ensure proper supervision and
Project implementation. The principal investments would be for buildings,
vehicles and equipment and headquarters operating costs during the Project
implementation period.
Training
3.10      The Project provides for training for the Project manager and the
head of the copra processing and marketing component at IRHO's center at Port
Bouet in the Ivory Coast and the head of the rodent control component at the
National Center for Crop Protection in Laguna, the Philippines. Training for
mid and lower level staff would be on-the-job, with the possibility of
providing short courses as appropriate. Training would be specifically
defined as a central responsibility of technical assistançe personnel (para
3.11) engaged in Project management.
Technical Assistance
3.11      Technical assistance would be required for Project management
and to train Comorian Project staff to manage Project developments because
suitably qualified Comorian staff are not available (para. 1.15). Specialists
to be engaged include a coconut improvement adviser (48 man-months), a rodent
control adviser (24 man-months) and a financial adviser (18 man-months). The
average man-month cost (including salary costs, fees, international travel and
subsistence) is expected to be about US$8,000 (para 4.02).
Financial and Administrative Unit
3.12      The Ministry of Production is currently implementing several agri-
culture projects (para. 1.19). By calendar year 1981 the Government expects
to have 7 projects under way. Presently the Financial and Administrative Unit
(FAU) within the Ministry does not have the capacity to monitor the financial
flows in these projects. The Project would include provision for a position
of a financial advisor, who would assist the head of FAU in monitoring the
preparation of project budgets, project accounts, disbursements and the status
of reimbursement claims (para 3.11). The Unit would also ensure that Government
contributions to projects are included in the National Budget and provide
training for financial and administrative staff working under various develop-
ment projects to use procedures that are adopted. Assurances were received
at negotiations that the Unit under the direction of a unit chief would be
maintained.
Studies and Trials
3.13      Baseline studies on areas included under the rodent component
and the copra marketing and processing component would be carried out to



- 24 -
assist Project management with their monitoring and evaluation efforts (para.
4.09). Surveys would be undertaken periodically to determine the impact of
the rodent control component, the amount and frequency of baiting (para. 5.05)
and also to determine rodent movements and tree preferences. Trials would be
carried out under the plant improvement component to determine the most
productive trees for selection and the effects of fertilizer.
C. Prolect Costs
3.14      Total Project Costs are estimated at about FCFA 1.23 billion
(US$5.7 million) of which US$3.5 million or 61% represent foreign exchange
costs. Details are summarized in the following table:

Project costs were estimated as of June 1980. A physical contingency of
15% was applied for all Project components to reflect the general uncertainty
of the detailed scope of Project investments and staffing requirements as this
is the firet IDA credit to agriculture in the Comoros. Price contingencies
were calculated on a cumulative basis: local costs at the rate of 12% for
1980 and 10% thereafter, foreign exchange costs at 10.5% for civil works,
equipment and technical assistance in 1980, 9% in 1981, 8% in 1982 and 7%
thereafter. Taxes included in Project costs are negligible since virtually
all items would be exempt from import duties. Details of Project costs are
summarized in Table 1.
D. Financing
3.15      Financing of Project costs would be shared as follows:
FCFA        US$
(million)  (million)    %
Government of Comoros               65         .30       6
Farmers                             43         .20       4
IDA                               1126       5.20       90
Total Project Cost             1234       5.70      100
3.16      The proposed IDA Credit of US$5.2 million would be to the Govern-
ment of the Comores on standard IDA terms.  The Credit would finance about
90% of total Project costs, including 100% of foreign exchange costs and about
77% of local costs. The Government of the Comoros would contribute about 6%
of total Project costs consisting of an increasing portion of local salary
costs over the life of the Project. Farmers would contribute 4% of total
Project costs which represents the value of the copra they contribute for the
bait. An advance of US$260,000 has been made to the Government under the
Project Preparation Facility to meet the cost of advance recruitment and
overseas training of key Project staff, in-country training offices, a vehicle
and advance recruitment of the coconut and rodent control advisors (Table
3).
E. Procurement
3.17      Procurement requirements would normally be scheduled and budgeted
annually. Contracts for rodenticides should be awarded to the lowest evaluated
bidder on the basis of limited international tendering. Materials and Civil
Works including site development and totalling about US$800,000 (including
contingencies) would generally be small (averaging less than US$80,000),
geographically scattered and could not always be grouped for simultaneous



- 26 -
tendering. These contracts would be awarded following local competitive
procedures which are satisfactory. Vehicles and equipment (US$350,000
including contingencies) would be purchased after quotation had been obtained
from suppliers represented in the Comoros offering adequate guarantees of
service and spare parts. Assurances as to these procedures were obtained at
negotiations.
F. Disbursements
3.18      Funds from the Credit Account would be disbursed over five years on
the following basis:
US$ million
(a) operating expenses
(i) 100% of total expenditures for vehicles,
equipment, materials and chemicals                0.07
(ii) 80% year 1, 75% year 2, 50% year 3,
40% year 4 and 20% year 5 for local
salaries                                          0.44
(b)  100% of total expenditures for civil works             0.50
(c) for establishment and development costs of
seed gardens and nurseries:
(i) 100% of total expenditures for the
MDxCT seed garden on Moheli                       0.12
(ii) 100% of total expenditures for all
other seed gardens and nurseries on
Moheli, Anjouan and Grande Comore                 0.80
(d)  100% of total expenditures for vehicles,
equipment, materials and rodenticide                   1.0
(e)  100% of total expenditures for
technical assistance costs                            0.70
(f)  100% of total expenditures for research
and Project related studies and training              0.27
(g)  refunding Project preparation advance                 0.26
(h)  initial deposit in Project account                    0.30
(i)  an unallocated sum representing part of
price contingencies                                   0.74
Total IDA Credit                         5.2



- 27 -
Disbursements against (b), (c)(i) and (ii), (e), (f) and foreign expendi-
tures under (a) would be fully documented. Disbursements for local costs
against (a) would be made against statements of expenditure certified by the
Project Director, the Project accountant and the Ministry of Finance. These
would be retained by the Borrower and made available for inspection by IDA in
the course of normal Project supervision and audited by the external auditors
selected to audit the Project (para 3.19). Assurances were received at
negotiations that all expenditures would be in accordance with annual work
plans (para. 4.04). An estimated schedule of IDA disbursements is given in
Table 2.
G. Accounts and Audit
3.19      Project accounts would be maintained by a Project accountant
employed by the Ministry of Production. He would be located at Project
headquarters and responsible for ensuring that adequate Project accounts
were kept by the island coordinators and would coordinate and verify them.
Control procedures would involve a budget established at the beginning of the
fiscal year under the control of the PAU to be set up under the Project.
Annual reviews of accounts would be carried out by the FAU. Assurances were
obtained at negotiations that: (i) satisfactory accounts would be maintained
by each Island Coordinator and consolidated accounts by the Project accountant;
and (ii) the accounts would be audited by external auditors acceptable to IDA
and the auditors' reports forwarded not later than six months after the end of
the financial year to which they related. The auditors would be asked to set
up the accounting system and propose procedures used to control disbursements
against statements of expenditure. The responsibility for auditing Government
Ministries' accounts rests with the Ministry of Finance and Planning which is
currently developing audit procedures.
H. Environmental Impact
3.20      The main impact of the proposed Project would be to ensure the
continuity of the Comoros primary source of food, drink and building material,
the coconut palm. The planting program would make an important contribution
to reducing soil erosion. The anticoagulants proposed for rodent control
are the least hazardous of all available rodenticides and their use is not
expected to have any adverse environmental effects (para 3.04).
IV. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
A. Proiect Organîzation and Staffing
General
4.01      The Coconut Production Service would be supervised by the Director
General of Rural Development of the Ministry of Production. The Service
would manage and supervise all activities pertaining to coconut and copra



- 28 -
production. These include rodent damage control (RDC), selection and breeding
of improved coconut varieties, distribution of seedlings, copra processing af:t
marketing, trials, monitoring and evaluation and research. The head of
the Service would be the Project Manager. The Service would include the head
of the RDC program who would be the deputy, the head of the copra processing
and marketing program, three Island Coordinators, who would each be responsible
for implementing all Project components, including the RDC program on their
respective islands, an accountant and support staff (Chart 2). Assurances
were received at negotiations that, for purposes of Project implementation,
the Coconut and Copra Production service would be maintained along with the
key Project positions indicated above. For the first two years of the Pro-
ject, when the seed gardens and nurseries were just getting started, the
Island Coordinators would be spending most of their time on the RDC program.
By year three of the Project, the Sector Specialists would assume most of the
day-to-day responsibility for the RDC program and the Island Coordinators
would spend approximately 60% of their time on the RDC program and the rest of
the time on the plant improvement program (para. 4.06). Studies, monitoring
and evaluation would be the responsibility of the Project manager (para 4.09)
4.02      At present there are no Comorians with sufficient experience to
manage and develop the coconut industry. For this reason, some technical
assistance would be required for Project management. A coconut improvement
advisor would assist the Project manager for the first four years of the
Project. His principal duties would be to set up the breeding and seedling
distribution program.  He would determine the most effective breeding and
selection and seedling production techniques. The head of the RDC program
would be assisted by a rodent control advisor during the first two years of
the project. The Financial Advisor would assist in increasing the effec-
tiveness of the FAU. Assurances were received at negotiations that quali-
fications, experience and terms and conditions of employment for expatriate
personnel would be submitted to the Association for approval. Terms of
reference for all key Project staff (the Project Director, the head of the RDC
program, the head of the Copra Processing and Marketing Service, the Project
Accountant, the three Island Coordinators and the three expatriate advisors
and the head of the FAU) were discussed and agreed to during negotiations.
Assurances were obtained that Government would consult with the Association
on the qualifications for and subsequent appointments to these posts. In
addition to training key staff listed above, the expatriate advisors would be
involved in on-the-job training of local staff in their respective areas of
competence. These include nine nursery officers, four pollinatois, four
enumerators, seven extension officers, seven RDC sector specialists and three
RDC field technicians.
4.03      The Project Director, the head of the RDC program, the head of the
copra processing processing and marketing component, the three Island
coordinators and the Project Accountant have all been appointed. Their
qualifications are satisfactory to the Association; given the crucial
importance of training, assurances were obtained that Government's annual
report to IDA would include a section on the progress of the on-the-job
training program.
4.04                                           . Specific Project implementation
programs would be based on a detailed annual work plan. This plan would be
prepared by the Project manager and his staff each year; it would be finalized



- 29 -
during October, i.e. three months prior to the commencement of each fiscal
year. Targets and financial provisions within each work plan would be
projected twice a year. The plan would be reviewed with Project staff and the
Director of Agriculture during IDA supervision missions which should normally
be timed to coincide with the review. Assurances were received at negotia-
tions that the work program for each year would be submitted to IDA for review
before October 1 of each year, commencing in 1980.
4.05      The Project Manager would be responsible for coordinating the major
activities under the Project. He would also be responsible for the final
preparation of annual work plans, and the subsequent annual reporting of
Project achievements. The Island Coordinators would be responsible for the
day-to-day management of the Project in accordance with the annual wDrk
plans.
Management of Prolect Components
4.06      The RDC Program.  This component would be run by the head of the
Rodent Control Service. He would report directly to the Project manager. The
head of the Service, working through the three Island Coordinators, would
provide direction to field level Sector Specialists. The Sector Specialists
would have responsibility for Project implementation at the village and
plantation level. Criteria for site selection would include density of palm
stands, villagers' willingness to contribute copra for bait preparation and a
predemoninance of smallholders. All copra collection, bait prepration and
village distribution would be the responsibility of the Island Coordinators.
Bait application would be the responsibility of the farmer who would receive
assistance from the Sector Specialists.
4.07      Breeding and Seedling Production.  Breeding and seedling production
of CT-Sel and the CT x T would be carried out on each island by the Island
Coordinators under the guidance of the coconut improvement advisor. Production
of hybrid seedlings (MD x CT), which would not become available until the
tenth year after the Project began, would be concentrated on MIheli (para.
5.08). Working under the Island Coordinators would be (a) Enumerators who
would assist with the selection of the seed gardens, (b) Pollinators who would
carry out artificial pollination, and (c) Nursery Foremen who would be respon-
sible for seedling production. By year four of the Project, when seedlings
would be produced on a large scale (see para. 6.10) the Island Coordinators
would also supervise extension workers who would advise farmers on the best
methods of planting new coconut trees in relation to the land use on their
farms on each island. In year 3 of the Project, two 3.5 ton trucks, one for
Anjouan and one for Grande Comore would be purchased for the distribution of
seedlings. The selection and breeding program would begin on Anjouan because
the shortage of coconuts for local consumption is the most serious there. The
Program would begin on Grande Comore and Moheli in year 2 of the Project.
4.08      Copra Processing and Marketing.  The head of this component would
report directly to the Project manager. Kilns, drying areas and storage
facilities would be provided. The program would concentrate initially on



- 30 -
Moheli where the potential for copra production is greatest, then move on to
Grande Comore in Year 2 and finally, in Year 3, to Anjouan. Some previous
attempts at furnishing copra kilns have failed because of a lack of cooperation
between farmers at the village level and on occasion, a failure to work
through local structures. Only villages which agree to participate in the
construction program, and give all villagers who process copra access to the
facilities, would be included in the program. The Program head would assist
each village receiving new installations to decide on how to keep track of
copra stored in the village store, how best to schedule the use of kilns and
drying areas and how to maintain the facilities. He would also help each
village draw up a plan which clearly sets out how the village intends to
manage its facilities. Assurances were received at negotiations that prior
to agreeing to a village receiving new facilities, the Copra Processing and
Marketing Officer would (i) together with the village elders draw up a plan
which clearly sets out how the villagers intend to manage their facilities and
(ii) obtain appropriate assurances from the villagers that the village would
participate in the construction program, partake in the maintenance of the
facilities and have access to the facilities according to a schedule drawn up
by the elders.
4.09      Studies and Trials.  This component would be the responsibility of
the Project Manager; he would delegate responsibility for specific studies and
surveys to the heads of the rodent control and copra processing and marketing
components. Under the plant improvement component, surveys would be taken to
determine the best replanting methods and how best to phase the elimination of
old unproductive trees. Surveys and trials would be taken to determine yields
in selected areas, effects of fertilizers and how best to further develop inter-
cropping. Under the copra marketing and processing component, studies would be
made on harvesting and drying methods and the use of coconut by-products.
Under the rodent control component, periodic trapping and damage surveys would
be conducted to evaluate the effectiveness and longevity of the rodent control
activities. Damage surveys would be initiated prior to the beginning of the
control program to provide baseline data on areas to be treated. Studies
would be conducted every three to five years according to the World Health
Organization's standards for resistance to anticoagulants to provide informa-
tion on the possible development of drug resistance. Additional studies and
trials related to coconut production would be designed and carried out in
accordance with specific problems and needs identified during Project implemen-
tation (para. 3.12). Assurances were obtained during negotiations that
terms of reference for the studies and trials would be submitted to IDA for
approval.
B. Project Implementation Schedule
4.10      The Project would be implemented over a five year period starting in
1981. Tables 3 and 4 show a tentative Project implementation schedule.
This was discussed during negotations. In order to facilitate Project
start-up, prior to Credit effectiveness, the Project director and the heads of
the Rodent Control and Copra Processing and Marketing components would receive
overseas training at specialized institutions, the Island Coordinators and



- 31 -
Sector Specialists would receive in-country training, and a vehicle, some
offices and housing would be provided. The rodent control advisor was
recruited on April 30, 1980 and the coconut advisor has been identified and
should be recruited by mid-June, 1980. These preparatory activities and
technical assistance would be financed under the Project Preparation Facility
(para. 3.15).
C. Financing Arrangements
4.11      Because the Government may have difficulty in pre-financing expend-
itures to be reimbursed under the IDA Credit, a pre-financing revolving fund
of US$0.3 million, financed under the Project, would be established in an
account which has been opened in a commercial bank for the purpose.  IDA would
replenish the account from the credit amount upon receipt of evidence of
disbursements from the revolving fund for allowable expenditures. Should any
disbursements be made from the revolving fund which are not acceptable to IDA,
the Government would deposit the corresonding amount in the Project account.
During negotiations agreement vas reached on terms and conditions for the
operation of this account.
D. Monitoring and Evaluation
4.12      The Comoros has not yet established a system for monitoring of
Project progress. Therefore the Project manager and the Director of Agri-
culture, with assistance from the coconut and rodent control advisors and in
consultation with IDA, would establish a simple monitoring plan to provide
key indicators of Project progress. These indicators would be kept under
constant review by supervision missions from IDA and the plan would be
amended from time to time, if necessary. The main subjects of interest would
include: the number of villages and the area involved in the rodent control
component, the drop-out rate, if any; the number of seed gardens and rural
nurseries and their annual production and sales; new buildings and housing,
the number of copra drying facilities in place, their management and villagers'
attitudes to components financed under the Project. The Government would
submit regular biannual and annual reports on the Project. Assurances to
this effect were obtained at negotiations.
Project Completion Report
4.13      The Government should prepare a completion report summarizing
performance under the Project and evaluating its successes and problems.
This should be submitted to IDA not later than six months after the expected
closing date (i.e. January 1987), and assurances to this effect were obtained
at negotiations.

V. TECHNICAL AND PRODUCTION ASPECTS
Rodent Control
5.01      Species.  Results of the appraisal mission's trapping efforts
indicate there are a minimum of three species of rodents in the Comoros and of
these, only one, a subspecies of Rattus rattus, appears responsible for the
majority, if not all, of the coconut losses. Specimens were captured on each
of the three islands and were found to be the most common rodent residing
within the palm plantations. Though the species was also captured in the
villages, it was not dominant there. Rattus rattus are basically arboreal
and, in the plantations, spend much of their time in the palm crowns.
5.02      Rodenticides.  An anticoagulant such as coumachlor would be the
active ingredient in the bait. This is consistent with the World Bank guide-
lines for the use of rodenticides. Coumachlor is a relatively inexpensive
rodenticide that has a long history of effective and safe usage and it is
readily available as a bait additive from several sources. In this form, the
chemical can be mixed directly with a bait carrier (copra) at a ratio of 1:39
to produce a bait having the desired 0.025% active ingredient content. Exclud-
ing contingencies and technical assistance, it has been calculated that the
average production cost would be about FCFA 84 per kg of prepared bait at 1980
prices. Farmers would contribute about 50% of this in the form of copra.
5.03      There are risks associated with the use of pesticides, but the anti-
coagulants are considered the least hazardous of all available rodenticides.
Coumachlor is considered only slightly toxic to animals when taken in a
single dose. Related materials have been used with success in rodent control
programs around the world. To be effective, they require repeated intake
over a period of several days. The hazard to human beings associated with
plantation baiting is almost nil (para 3.04).
5.04      It has been demonstrated in urban control programs that after a
decade or more of continued exposure to anticoagulant baits, the Norway rat
exhibit an increasing tolerance to anticoagulant drugs. Genetic resistance
has been demonstrated in the United States and in Europe. It is possible
that a greater tolerance for a specific anticoagulant will develop in rodent
populations of the Comoros after continued exposure over a period of years.
The time required for drug resistance to develop in a rural tropical environ-
ment with a different species of rodent is an unknown factor but one which
will be monitored closely (para. 4.09).
5.05      Baiting.  The amount of bait required for the village level campaign,
phase I, would vary with the density of the rodent population and availability
of other sources of food (para 3.04). However, bait should be made available at
daily intervals until consumption stops. This could continue for a week or
even longer during the first baiting. The time interval between campaigns would
depend upon the degree of control achieved and the tolerance levels of villagers.
The plantation campaign, phase II, would require baiting the crowns of the



- 33 -
palms. Rodents in the plantations spend some time on the ground but the
crowns are their preferred habitat. Trials and evaluation would determine
the optimum amounts and frequency of baiting (para 3.13). Experience gained
in the Phillippines indicates that monthly intervals are appropriate. The
amount of bait per package (amount to treat one tree) would initially be set
at 150 grams for treatment of plantations with heavy damage. Treating 20 to
25 trees per hectare should be adequate (about every third or fourth tree)
but even this interval might be increased after the first application.
5.06      In the Phillipines the bait is sealed in small plastic bags and
this practice would be promoted under the proposed Project. The bags would be
placed into the crowns of moderately high trees from ground level with the
aid of bamboo or telescopic aluminum poles. For crowns beyond reach, climbing
the trees would be necessary. Another application technique to be evaluated
would be propelling the bait packages into the crowns by means of specially
designed slingshots.
Breeding Program
5.07      A 12 year breeding program is proposed which would produce seedlings
sufficient to replace 70% of the existing palm trees and increase the density
of the stands. The breeding program aims to produce high-yielding planting
material, well adapted to the different ecological conditions prevailing in
the Comoros.   The breeding and selection techniques, though as yet untried in
the Comoros, have been widely tested and have given good results in other
countries, among them Madagascar, Sri Lanka, the Philippines, and the Ivory
Coast. The program would produce three genetic palm types: one for the less
favorable palm-growing areas with stony soils and/or dry weather conditions, a
second for areas with favorable ecological conditions where palms are grown
and interplanted with other tree crops and a third for areas with favorable
ecological conditions where palms are grown or could be grown in pure stands.
5.08      Seed Gardens.  The program for the less favorable areas would
consist of selection of good palms among the native tall palm population,
Selected Comorian Tall or CT-Sel. This requires the establishment of seed
gardens in good palm plantations and selection on the basis of yields and age
of about 15 of the best palms per hectare. These trees would be well main-
tained and systematic rodent control would be carried out. It is expected
that these palms would yield an average of 75 nuts per palm. The seed nuts
would be bought at a premium price from the owner of the palms to ineure that
the nuts were not used for other purposes. The nuts would be planted in
Project nurseries where they would remain for one year at the end of which a
selection would be made and vigorous seedlings would be distributed to farmers.
It is estimated that about 50% of nursery seedlings would be rejected.
5.09      The program for high potential areas with intercropping would
consist of pollinating selected local tall palms (CT Sel) with pollen from
tall palms (T) from outside the island with proven high yield potential such
as the West African Tall. For these crosses, CT-Sel seed gardens would be
established as described above and selected palms artificially pollinated.
The resulting seed will be a CT-Sel x T cross. Artificial pollination is
normally less efficient than open pollination and it is expected that the
selected palms would yield only 45 seeds per year. It is estimated that 40%

would be rejected at the nursery and the remainder distributed. The plantings
from crosses of Comorian Talls with West African Talls have already performed
successfully in neighboring Madagascar. The variety of tall material to be
introduced would be decided during Project implementation.
5.10      The production of Tall x Dwarf hybrids is foreseen for high potential
areas where pure stands are or could be grown. Malaysian Dwarf seed nuts
(MD) or other dwarf varieties would be imported, probably from the Ivory Coast
and interplanted in CT-Sel seed gardens in which 47 of the best CT palms would
be retained. When after six to eight years, the MD palms begin to bear, the
male inflorescences would be removed before they matured and the MD would be
naturally (open) pollinated by the surrounding CT palms. The result would be
a MD x CT seed nut. It is assumed that MD palms would begin producing MD x CT
nuts six years after planting and yield assumptions per tree are 10 in year six,
30 in year seven, 50 in year eight and 72 from year nine on. The 15 ha MD x
CT seed gardens are planned for Moheli as it is here that land is most readily
available and therefore that pure stands are most appropriate. The land
selected for the MD x CT seed gardens must be bought by the Government because
no planter would forego the loss in production and the Government must have
long-term control over the land as seed production of MD x CT seedlings would
only start six years after the first MD seedling was planted. Government
acquisition of 15 ha on Moheli for seed gardens would be a condition of
disbursement for this component.

Operating costs for Anjouan and Grande Comore would remain constant from
year 5 to year 12. For Moheli they would be the same from year 5 to year 8
and then would increase by an average of US$20,000/year over years 9-12 which
represents operating costs of the MD x CT nurseries.

near the stands where the palm will grow.
Producer Benefits
5.13      Rodent Control Program.  This component would benefit up to 6,500
families, 3,400 on Moheli and 1,550 each on Anjouan and Grand Comore. Farmer
benefits would depend on the size of their plantations. At the current price
of 10 FCFA per nut, the gross annual income of an owner of 55 palms owning 1.3
ha after subtracting subsistence nut requirements, would be 14,220 FCFA
(US$66) without rodent control and 26,460 FCFA (US$123) with rodent control.
Net incremental income after deduction for the cost of copra that farmers would
contribute for the bait 1/ would be 10,800 FCFA or about US$50 which, given
estimated rural family farm income of US$100.00 per annum, is significant.
5.14      Plant Improvement.  Approximately 20,000 families, most of them are
small farmers, would benefit from the 12 year breeding program the first five
years of which would be financed under the Project. This program would
gradually rejuvenate old palm stands, replacing them with younger and more
vigorous material and higher yielding palms and ensure that farmers continue
to produce a sufficient quantity of nuts to satisfy local consumption demand
(para. 7.02). Incremental nut production would be expected to go from 300,000
in 1990 to 31 million by the year 2010 (para. 7.03 and Table 7). Without the
Project, deficits for local consumption of about a million nuts per year would
begin occurring in 1986. It is estimated that these deficits would grow by
about five million nuts every five years up to 2006 when they would reach 19
million nuts a year.
5.15      Copra Processing and Marketing.  This component could benefit up to
6,000 families. An unknown quantity of copra is currently wasted as it
is either burned while drying or not sufficiently dried and deteriorates
1/   Estimated at 2 kg/ha/month or 2 x 60 FCFA x 12 months = 1,440 FCFA.

later. The amount of copra saved is difficult to quantify but as an order of
magnitude, losses would be reduced from 7% to 3%.  In addition, the farmers
would benefit from plans to introduce a premium price for sun-dried copra.
VI. GOVERNMENT BENEFITS
6.01      Costs of Project investments would only be partially recovered
directly from beneficiaries. In undertaking the plant rehabilitation com-
ponent, the Government would, in effect, be committed to a 12-year develop-
ment program that would not begin to yield financial or other benefits until
about 15 years after the Project began. Operating costs of the seed gardens
and nurseries following the Project period would be the responsibility of
Government although external financing might be available to cover some of
these costs. Annual operating costs at the end of the Project period (1980
prices) are estimated at about US$290,000 a year.  It is expected that
initially a small part of the cost of the seed garden and nursery program
would be recovered from farmers through the payment of a seedling fçe.
Assurances were received at negotiations that seedlings would be di9tributed
to farmers for a amall fee not to exceed 50% of production costs whiçh would
be determined by Government by June 30, 1981.   This charge would enable
management to keep better track of who receives the seedlings and would
discourage the "gift syndrome." Not charging the full seedling cost is
reasonable in these circumstances because it would take many years before new
plantings begin to bear fruit and growers contribution in the form of labor,
prior to the first harvest, would be substantial. The rodent control com-
ponent would achieve full benefits by year 5 of the Project. Under this
component, farmers would contribute the bait carrier (in most cases corpra)
whose monetary value equals about half of the total cost of the prepared bait.
They would also contribute the labor to place the bait in the tree crowns.
Additional charges would not be made during the first three years of the
Project program as it would seem counter-productive to start charging the full
cost of the Rodent Control Program to beneficiaries before control techniques
were fully tested and advantages widely demonstrated and accepted by growers.
Future charges would be determined during Project implementation. The cost of
maintaining the rodent control program after the Project period (1980 prices)
is estimated at US$230,000/year. Part of this cost could be recovered from
duty received from the export of copra (para 2.11). Assurances were received
at negotiations that the Government would consult annually with the
Association on proposed policies for cost recovery from Project investments
including taxes on copra exports and user fees for copra drying facilities.
Table 5 shows a tentative Government cash flow.
VII. MARKETS AND PRICES
7.01      Fresh Nuts and Copra.  Fresh nuts are freely traded in the Comoros
and their price is determined by supply and demand (para. 2.10). Nuts remain-
ing after local consumption needs have been met are transformed into copra for
export. Because of its geographical location and commercial links that have
been built up over the years, the Comoros are the primary supplier of copra to
Madagascar, whose yearly consumption of copra (3,000 tons) exceeds the Comoros'



- 38 -
supply. Copra, like fresh nuts, is freely traded in the Comoros and competi-
tion between the traders for the available copra currently assures a fair
price to the producer (para 2.11). Traders are presently exploring the
possibility of exporting sun-dried copra to Asia and the African Continent,
and this should further stimulate buying as well as maintain rcasonable
producer prices. In order to insure against world price fluctuations, the
Government is currently considering the establishment of a National Price
Stabilization Fund to cover copra as well as the other principal cash crops,
vanilla, cloves and ylang-ylang. The Government intends to have the Fund
operational by June, 1981 (para 2.12). Assurances were received at negotia-
tion that Government would (a) reactivate the stabilization fund for Copra and
establish a mechanism for setting a floor price to the producer by June 1,
1981, and (b) agree to consult annually with the Association on the structure
of the Stabilization Fund and on the pricing structure for copra.
7.02      Rural Nurseries.  Previous experience in the Comoros suggests that
farmers would be keen to plant seedlings and it is expected that the production
from rural nurseries would be readily accepted and utilized by farmers. The
seedling charge would be worked out during Project implementation (para 6.01).
VIII. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
8.01      Benefits resulting directly from Project investments would consist
of increased production of fresh nuts for both local consumption and for
transformation into copra for export. Given local consumption patterns and
projected population increases (see Table 6), if there were no organized
effort to rejuvenate the existing coconut stand, deficits for local con-
sumption of about a million nuts a year would occur by 1986. These annual
deficits would increase to about 6.4 million by 1990, 12.5 million by 1995, 17
million by the year 2000 and level off at 19 million by 2006 when it is
assumed that population growth will stabilize. The coconut presently provides
an estimated 27% of annual protein intake per inhabitant. In addition, it
provides oil and fuel for cooking and the coconut palm provides wood and
thatching material for building. Deficits of the proportions indicated above
would mean that food, oil and building material would all have to be imported
to substitute for products provided by the coconut palm, all at considerable
cost to the Comorian economy. The coconut rehabilitation component together
with the rodent control program should ensure that there would be sufficient
quantities of nuts for local consumption and a surplus for the export of
copra. The coconut rehabilitation component, after allowances for rodent
damage, should result in an estimated annual incremental production of 0.3
million nuts in 1990, 8.2 million in 1995, 27.0 million in year 2000 and 31.0
million in year 2010. During the Project period all incremental nut production
would be transformed into copra. Export earnings from the sale of incremental
copra at the end of the Project period would be about US$700,000 per year in
1979 constant prices and would increase to about US$1.8 million 10 years later
when the planting program neared full production. From year 1986-1990 incre-
mental production used for local consumption is estimated to go from 10% to 66%
as a result of population growth and it is estimated to remain at 66% through



- 39 -
1997. After 1997, when many of the seedlings from the replanting program
would be nearing full production, about one half of the incremental production
would be used for local consumption and one half for copra. These benefits
reflect only the direct production increases and should thus be considered
a conservative estimate of likely benefits. Additional benefits which are
difficult to quantify include, for the rodent control component: improved
health standards and reduced losses of stored food crops, particularly rice
and cassava; for the copra processing and marketing component, the improve-
ment in copra quality and the introduction of a grading system which would
separate sun-dried from kiln-dried copra and should lead to higher prices; for
the plant improvement component, an increase in coconut shells which are used
for fuel in cooking and coconut tree trunks and palms which are used as
building materials. In addition to these agricultural and health benefits, the
Project would assist the development of basic agricultural services and improve
planning, implementation of development schemes and services to farmers. The
development of local institutions and training of staff and farmers would
affect future agricultural activities in the Comores.
8.02      The economic rate of return from directly productive elements of
the Project is estimated at 13.9% over 30 years. This reflects the long term
gestation period for new plantings. While this rate of return is somewhat
low, alternative investment opportunities are limited in the Comoros at this
stage and rehabilitation of the coconut stands is essential to the well-being
of all Comorians. All Project costs which relate directly to expected
increases in production vere included in the analysis. The full cost of the
rodent control advisor and the coconut advisor were included along with 10% of
the cost of the financial advisor. The cost of unskilled labor, including
farm labor, was evaluated at its actual cost which reflects prevailing market
costs of labor. The Comorian Franc is freely convertible into the French
Franc and was evaluated at the prevailing market rate. Prices used in cal-
culation of benefits vere those prevailing in June 1980. The rate of return
was tested for sensitivity. If costs increased by 10% the rate of return
would be reduced to 12.3%. If benefits were reduced by 10% the rate of return
would be reduced to 12.1%. If benefits were to be delayed by one year, the
rate of return would be reduced to 12.0%. The switching values for the
Project, using an opportunity cost of capital of 10%, are as follows: 11.4%
for the benefits and 12.4% for the costs.
8.03      Separate rates of return were calculated for the rodent control
component and the coconut rehabilitation and copra processing and marketing
components. The rate of return for the rodent control component was 33.3%.
If benefits were delayed by one year the rate of return would be 23.0%.
The rate of return for the coconut rehabilitation and copra processing and
marketing component was 10.0% and if the benefits were delayed by one year,
9.3%. For the purpose of the economic analysis, local nuts for consumption
were valued at the export parity price. To the extent that the alternative to
the Project for the Comoros is to import substitute products by 1987, the
economic rate of return calculation should be regarded as conservative.
Economie rate of return calculations are summarized in Table 6.
8.04      The Project could encounter significant problems during implementa-
tion as it would be IDA's first agricultural Project in the Comoros, the
Ministry of Production is not familiar with IDA's procedures and Govern-
ment services are just beginning to resume operations after almost two years



- 40 -
of social experiments during which most of the Government civil servants
were dismissed (para. 1.16). In addition, the new constitution is federal
and the administrative responsibilities of the federating units, the island,
have not yet been clearly worked out. Some coordination difficulties could
evolve between the Central Government and the Island Governments which could
also delay Project implementation. The risks are somewhat mitigated by the
simplicity of the Project and its minimum reliance on Government's nascent
administrative services. Moreover, it is expected that the Project would be
closely supervised, further attenuating the risk of implementation diffi-
culties.  There is a risk that yields would be lower than expected but the
seed production program proposed under the Project has been carried out
successfully in neighbouring Madagascar where conditions are similar and
yields there have been satisfactory.  Another important risk is that
farmers' initial enthusiasm for the rodent control program would wear off
after the first year and it would be particularly important that the team
working on this component continue to ensure farmer involvement in Project
implementation and adequate support from local island officials. Price-related
risks should be minimal as the prices forecast for copra through 1990 are
steady. Although the Project promises to present some difficulties, its short
term impact on quantities of copra available for export and long term impact
on one of the archipelago's most precious assets, the coconut palm, far
outweigh these difficulties.
Employment and Ic ome Distribution
8.05      An estimated 20,000 farm families would be expected to benefit
from the plant rehabilitation component and 6,500 of these from the rodent
control component Project. Most of these families would be from the lowest
income category. A limited number of new jobs would be created through
the Project's construction activities as well as additions to Government
services and agencies.
