COCONUT REHABILITATION AND RODENT CONTROL PROJECr
LCr. 1035-COM)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Coconut Rehabilitation and Rodent
Control Project, for which IDA Credit 1035-COM in the amount of US$5.2 million equivalent was
approved on June 3, 1980. The credit was closed on December 31, 1988, two years behind schedule.
An undisbursed amount of US$0.96 million was cancelled on December 30,1988.
The Preface, Evaluation Summary and Parts I and Im were prepared by the Food and
Agriculture Organization/World Bank Cooperative Program (FAO/CP), and finalized by the
Agriculture and Environment Division of the South-Central and Indian Ocean Department, Africa
Regional Office. On April 20, 1992, the Borrower was sent a copy of the PCR with a request to
prepare Part IIL but no response was received.
Preparation of the PCR was started during a visit to the Comoros by a team from FAO/CP
in November 1991 and is based inter alia on information gathered in the Comoros, discussions with
project staff and officials of the Ministry of Production, Federal Center for Rural Development
(CEFADER/CADER), Bank staff associated with the Project, the Staff Appraisal Report, the
Development Credit Agreement, supervision reports, correspondence between IDA and the Borrower
and internal IDA memoranda.

COCONUT REHABILITATION AND RODENT CONTROL PROJECT
(Cr. 1035-COM)
EVALUAT10N SUMMARY
BackgMDd
1.        Agricultue dominaes the country's economy. Agricultural production comes almost
entirely from the smallholder sector. To meet basic family food requiremen, the overriding
emphasis of production is on foodcrops. Governmentes primary objectives for the development of
the agriculul sector are to increase food self-sufficiency and reduce imports through productvty
improvements while increasing export crop productivity and enhancing land conservation.
ftWect-Objectives 
2.         This was the first IDA-financed agriculural project in the Comoros. It aimed to extend
and improve coconut and copra production on the three islands of Grande Comore, Anjouan and
Moheli, through rodent control, increased productivity of the existing stands from replanting and new
planting, and improvement of copra processing and marketng. Improvement was necessary on all
islands either because of poor maintenance of plantations, poor genetic quality and age of palms, or
limited marketing and processing facilities. The project aims fitted well with the need for ttie
Comoros to increase the income level of its people through increased agricultur production and also
with Government's objective to meet present and future coconut demand for domestic consumpdon
and to re-establish the previous export levels of copra. The project, to be implemented by the
Mnistry of Production over a period of five years, included the establishment of a rodent contol
unit, the creation of a copra processing and marketing service, the establishn'ent of seed gardens and
nurseries for the production of high-yielding coconut planting material, training and technical
assistance, studies and the creation of a project management and administrative service. The project
cost was estmated at US$5.7 million, with the Govenument contributng US$300,000, project
beneficiaries US$200,000 and IDA US$5.2 milion equivalet
LM21ementatiol
3.         Despite the good technical results, overfil project implementation was disappoiing.
While it was shown that high yielding hybrid varieties of coconut psin grow well In the Comoros,
only 25% of the coconut seedlings produced by the project were a. ually sold (17% of appraisal
targets). Farmers were not interested in planting them for a number of reasons. Firsdy, copra
exports ceased due to low world market prices and the overvalued exchange rate. Secondly, cocomnt
production already exceeded demand on the domestic market (by about 8 million mns annually), and
domestic prices were further depressed by edible oil food aid distribution. Thirdly, high-yidting
hybrids outperformed traditional varieties only when fertilizers were applied at an early stage, and
because of their low height, did not permit the traditional mixed cropping widely practiced by small
farmers. By the end of the project, in 1988, only 258 ha of hybrid varieties had been planted by
farmers, representing about 14% of the overall planting program envisaged at appraisal. Seed



iv
production was halted in 1988 and seedling distribution activities stopped in 1989. Only one of the
19 kilns planned to be constructed under the project, to help alleviate the shortage of adequate copra
drying installations, was built and operated successfully on a trial basis. The fall of the copra world
market price was the main reason for the failure of this component. The rat control component of
the project encountered technical difficulties during implementation. The high cost of the bait
discouraged farmers and the large-scale disinfestation program, of over 8,000 ha envisaged at
appraisal never got under way.
4.         Due to delays in the provision of counterpart funds, project management used the IDA
Special Account to keep the project functioning. This practice was discovered in November 1987.
As a result, the use of the special account was discontinued, a schedule for repayment of the
ineligible expenditures was established, and the credit agreement was amended on June 16, 1988, to
reflect Government's limited financial resources (i.e., Government to pay for salaries and IDA for
95% of all other recurrent expenditures).
5.         The project closing date was extended by two years from December 31, 1986, to
December 31, 1988, in order to allow (i) for the completion of the distribution of locally grown
seedlings, which had only started in earnest in 1986 and (ii) for the orderly transfer of activities to
the Federal Center for Rural Development (CEFADER). Actual project costs were US$4.4 million
(77% of estimate), with IDA financing US$4.2 million (81% of estimate) and the Government
US$200,000 (67% of estimate). The contribution by project beneficiaries is not available.
Uroiect R ealt
6.         Despite its poor performance in respect of physical implementation, the project, from
a technical standpoint, was generally successful. For the first time, hybrid seedlings grown from
locally produced seeds were planted by farmers in the Comoros. Demonstra.ion plots and fertilizer
trials were conducted properly and results measured. Yields of hybrid coconut trees were about 50%
above those of indigenous varieties and copra and coconut oil content was 30% higher. However,
acceptance of the hybrids by the farmers had been limited and the impact of the project on overall
coconut production was negligible. As regards rodent control, trials with the new bait formulation
and related techniques carried out in villages and in selected areas proved highly effective, resulting
in a reduction of rat infestation by 95%. The rodent control component was originally appraised on
the basis that coconut losses due to rodents were 37%; during project implementation it became
apparent, however, that losses were much less than estimated and that rodent control, in the context
of the Comoros, is not economically viable.
Proiect Sustainability
7.         It is almost certain that the institutional and physical infrastructure put in place will soon
cease to exist. The coconut seed garden and seed nurseries, for instance, which were designed to be
self-financing, are not maintained because of lack of farmers' interest .o plant coconut hybrids The
rodent control program was not sustainable since it failed to recover the cost of the operation. At
the time of the PCR mission, in 1991, maintenance of project buildings and infrastructural works was
nonexistent and many of the project buildings were in bad condition and/or occupied by people who
had no relationship with the project's activities. Coconut extension activities were gradually taken
over by CEFADER, starting in 1986.



v
Lessgns Leared
8.         Two key lessons can be learned from this project:
(i)    The viability of key technical messages, as well as their acceptability to
farmers, should have been fully assessed during appraisal and during
subsequent design changes; and
(ii)    When it became apparent during implemeu.tation that world market prices were
considerably below expectations, the economic viability of the project snould
have been reassessed and the possibility of an early Credit closing considered.

The Ag[icultural Setor
2.1        At the time of project preparation in 1979, about 80% of the population in the Comoros
lived in rural areas and gained their livelihood from agriculture, which contributed nearly 40% of
GDP and practically all export earnings, a situation which is relatively unchanged today. The
Comoros agricultural economy was, for the most part, comprised of smallholders who earned a
meager livelihood using traditional cultivation techniques. Coconut was the principal crop (a source
of food and drink, cooking oil, thatching material, wood and copra). Major staple crops included
cassava and pigeon peas, cultivated at lower altitudes, and rice and beans at higher altitudes. Ylang-
ylang, vanilla, cloves and copra were the principal export crops. Agricultural production was derived
almost entirely from the smallholder sector, with average farm holdings amounting to about 0.33 ha
in Anjouan, 0.84 ha In Grande Comore and 3.75 ha in Moheli.
the Agricultural De-velopmen Straeg
*           2.2         Although the environmental conditions provided potential for growing a wide range of
food and cash crops, production in the Comoros was concentrated on export crops (vanilla, cloves,
copra and essential oils), to the detriment of food crop productiou. Expansion of food crop
production was further constrained by the lack of access roads to the most suitable areas in the higher
interior. The value of exports, however, was sufficient to offset the annual imports of foodstuffs
(rice, wheat flour, meat, milk and sugar). Large price fluctuations of export crops on the world
market, a breakdown of the marketing infrastructure following independence, and insufficient
attention to quality standards were responsible for declines in the export of some of the more sensitive
crops in the face of competition by other producers. The major challenge for the Comoros was,
therefore, to increase the income levels of its people through increased agricultural production and
Government's main objectives for agricultural development were to:
(a)    attain self-sufficiency in the production of staple foods and animal protein
(meat and fish); and



2
(b)    re-establish and maintain the previous export levels of the major export crops.
3. Project Objiectives and Desgription
3.1        The project aimed at improving coconut and copra production on the three islands of
Grande Comore, Anjouan and Moheli, through new plantings, replanting, rat eradication, improved
maintenance, marketing, and copra drying and processing. Improvement was necessary on all islands
because of poor maintenance of plantations, poor genetic quality and age of palms, limited marketing
and processing facilities. Of the total coconut production, roughly one-third was estimated to be
consumed by the local population, one-third converted into copra for export, and one-third destroyed
by rodents. While rodent eradication was a vital i)mponent of the coconut improvement program,
it was also envisaged that it would reduce losses of other fruit crops inter-planted with coconut, as
well as improve public health conditions. Care and maintenance of native coconut plantations were
minimal and drying of copra was primitive. Specifically, the project over a period of five years,
included the following components:
(a)    Establishment of a rodent control unit for each island which, over the life of
the project, was to treat 8,000 ha: 2,000 ha each on Grande Comore and
Anjouan and 4,000 ha on Moheli;
(b)    Creation of a Copra Processing and Marketing Service which was to monitor
the construction of improved drying and storage facilities and work with
farmers to improve the quality of copra;
(c)    Establishment of seed gardens and nurseries on each island for the production
of high yielding plant material for replanting and new planting;
(d)    Project management and administrative services;
(e)    Overseas training for key project personnel and on-the-job training for project
staff;
(f)    Technical assistance for project implementation and for the Financial and
Administrative Unit within the Ministry of Pioduction; and
(g)    Studies, field trials and monitoring and evaluation of project progress.
4.  roject Design and Organization
4.1        Eroect design. Originally, the project included a breeding program aimed at producing
high yielding planting material, well adapted to the different ecological conditions and farming
systems prevailing in the Comoros. The production of three genetic palm types was envisaged
through selection and breeding of local tall and imported tall and dwarf genetic material. Ihe three
palm types corresponded to:
(a)    less favorable growing areas with stony soils and/or dry weather conditions;
(b)    fertile areas where palms were interplanted with other trees or foodcrops; and



3
(c)    fertile areas where pure coconut plantations were or could be established.
This program, however, was never implemented as conceived at appraisal. At the advice of the
French Institute for Oils and Fats (IRHO), which was given the responsibility of project technical
assistance, and with the agreement of the project management and IDA, it was completely altered.
Instead of three genetic palm types from local material, the revised program proposed the introduction
to the Comoros of only one hybrid of completely foreign origin, the PB121 (Malaysian Dwarf x West
African Tall). The main argument was that the three different types of genetic material, which were
proposed for the improvement program, were of mediocre or unknown value. According to IRHO,
the revised program had the advantage of giving the possibility to the project to start its coconut
rehabilitation activities sooner by using a well known hybrid with a proven good performance and
flexibility in many other countries. Also, under this revised program only one seed garden of 15 ha
was sufficient to cover distribution requirements against 315 ha planned, and planting of the hybrid
could begin much earlier through hybrid nut imports from the Ivory Coast rather than awaiting the
production of planting material from the project seed garden.
4.2        This decision proved to be of critical importance in the unsuccessful implementation of
the project. The introduction of the PB121 hybrid, which performs well under improved pure stand
agricultural practices but poorly under traditional and hard growing conditions, was not a simple
operation. The adaptability of the hybrid to local conditions was not reviewed.
4.3        Proiect organization.  For purposes of project implementation, the Government
maintained the Coconut and Copra Production Service (CCPS) within the Ministry of Production,
along with the key project posts. The CCPS, supervised by the Director General of Rural
Development of the Ministry of Production, was given responsibility for managing and supervising
aI activities pertaining to coconut production. The head of the Service became Project Director and
the head of the Rodent Control program of the project, his Deputy. The Finance and Administrative
Unit (FAU) in the Ministry of Production was assigned responsibility for project accounting under
the Project Chief Accountant. Because of the difficulty of finding an experienced national accountant
to head FAU, Government and IDA agreed that the financial adviser to the Ministry of Production
under the technical assistance component be seconded to the project until a Comorian would be able
to take over the responsibilities of financial director. This was actually fulfilled in 1988, when all
accounting and financial activities of the project were passed over to the Federal Center for Rural
Development (CEFADER), Administrative and Finance Division. The project director had day-to-
day operational responsibility for the project but was supported by technical staff both at headquarters
and by Island Coordinators, who retained technical lines of responsibility. The project was scheduled
to extend over five years, starting in 1980/81, and expected to cost US$ 5.7 million, of which IDA
was to provide US$ 5.2 million, the remainder being funded locally by the Government of Comoros
(GOC) (UJS$ 0.3 million) and by farmers participating in the project (US$ 0.2 million).
5. PEMc j mlementation
5.1        Poect start-up. The credit became effective on October 8, 1980; a delay of only eight
days. With financing available under a Project Preparation Facility, initial works required to
conunence implementation were carried out satisfactorily.
5.2        Proiect Costs and Financing. Actual project costs are estimated at US$4.4 million (77%
of appraisal estimate), with IDA financing US$4.2 million (81% of estimate) and the Government
US$200,000 (67% of estimate). The contribution made by project beneficiaries is not available. The



4
lower than expected project costs were the result of less than estimated spending for the copra
processing component, the plant improvewent component (substantially less was spent on seed
gardens, etc.) and the training component. Much more was spent on operating costs, following the
agreement by IDA to take on mole non-salary operatin,, expenses and consultants' services following
the redesign of the project.
5.3        Disb=Mn. Delays in the Government contribution affected project implementation
and thus disbursements. Disbursements were further affected by the discovery In November 1987
that project management had used the special account to finance expenditures that were not eligible
for IDA financing, in the absence of adequate Government counterpart funding. The credit
agreement was amended on April 4, 1983, to allow for the establishment of a copra price stabilization
fund; this fund never became operational because of the inability of Government to provide adequate
working capital. The credit agreement was subsequently amended on June 16, 1988, in order to
reduce the Government contribution to the project (Government only to provide financing for salaries;
IDA to provide financing for 95% of all other operating expenses), so that project activities could
be maintained until the credit closing date. The project was extended twice beyond the original
closing date of June 30, 1986, i.e. to December 31, 1987 and finally to December 31, 1988, when
total project disbursement reached US$ 4.2 million or 81 % of appraisal estimates. The undisbursed
amount of US$ 0.96 million was canceled on December 30, 1988. The credit extension in 1986 was
given to allow for the distribution of seedlings, of which production had just started in earnest. Mhe
extension in 1987 was granted to allow for the orderly transfer of activities to CEFADER.
5.4        Procurement. This project was the first IDA-financed agricultural project in the
Comoros. In spite of inexperience of project staff in dealing with IDA procedures and the overall
procurement problems in the Comoros, acquisition of basic equipment to commence implementation
was satisfactory. The contract for the construction of staff houses, guest house accommodation and
office space in Moheli was negotiated in early 1981 and the infrastructure completed by 1987 without
undue problems. Procurement problems occurred with the award of the contract for the construction
of houses on Grande Comore. The housing sub-component had to be re-tendered and this caused
some delays in the execution of the building construction program. Imports of PB121 hybrid nuts
from the Ivory Coast in 1981, 1983 and 1985 were carried out as planned. The pollen required for
plant improvement was also procured from the same source as the nuts, without any delays.
5.5        Establishment of seed garden and nurseries. A total of eight seed nurseries were
established on the three islands, in accordance with implenmentation proposals. The first hybrid nut
import from the Ivory Coast took place in 1981 and continued in 1983 and 1985. Hybrid seed
production started in 1986 as scheduled and continued without serious problems until March 1988.
At that time a huge surplus of PB121 hybrid seedlings had been built up in the nurseries, because of
the limited demand from farmers. While the technical results obtained from project field trials and
the seed gardens had shown that high yielding hybrids of coconut palm grow well in the Comoros,
only 17% of the coconut seeds produced were actually sold. Farmers were not interested in planting
the hybrids for a number of reasons. Firstly, copra exports had virtually ceased, due to unexpectedly
low world market prices and the over-valued exchange rate. 1/ Secondly, coconut production
1/        In November 1979, world market prices in constant US$ per metric ton, cif
Europe, were expected to remain around US$600 through 1990. The actual
world market prices, however, fell substantially after 1979 and were with the
exception of 1983 and 1984, never more than half the projected prices.



S
exceeded demand on the domestic market (by about eight million nuts annually), and domestic prices
were further depressed by the World Food Program (WFP) edible oil and food aid distribution
program. Thirdly, the high-yielding PB121 hybrid outperformed the local tall variety only under
optimal improved cultural practices (use of fertilizers at early stage, pure stand; smaller distance
between trees, i.e. a density of 160 trees/ha versus 70 of the local variety), and also, because of their
low height, did not permit the traditional mixed cropping widely practiced by small farmers. By the
end of the project, in December 1988, only 258 ha were planted with hybrids, representing about
14% of the appraisal estimates. Seed production was halted in 1988 at the recommendation of IDA.
At the Moheli seed garden, the primary seed garden, all activities ceased, and the Government
*           dismissed all personnel except one watchman. Since then, the situation of the seed garden has
progressively deteriorated and in 1991 the site had been almost completely abandoned.
5.6        As regards the seed nursery activities, implementation was satisfactory during the first
period of their establishment, when the number of seedlings they had to handle was limited. But in
the following years, with the increase of seedling production and distribution activities in the
nurseries, the quality of seedlings decreased. Infrastructural problems such as Inadequate size of the
nursery, unsuitable location, lack of irrigation facilities, and shortage of water for irrigation, in
addition to financial, logistical and personnel problems have affected implementation of this
component.
5.7        Rodent control. Project achievements for this component, as shown in Table 4, Part m,
were disappointing. The program started up in 1982 and by 1983, some 8,300 village houses and
about 1,100 coconut stands had received the first treatment. Maintenance treatment was applied to
about 4,000 houses and 900 coconut stands. Although these achievements were well above appraisa
targets, results were not satisfactory because of the poor effectiveness of the rodenticide and methods
used. The project approach was therefore changed and, in spite of th'. fact that trials conducted in
1984 had proven that new baits and methods applied were more effective, tne project was unable to
maintain the same pace of implementation attained in the previous years. Moreover, both village
population and farmers had lost confidence in the rodent control program. Information from annual
reports indicates that, from 1984, participation of village populations in the rodent control program
ranged from 16.3% in Anjouan to 18.4% in Grande Comore and 30.1% in Moheli for the first
treatment. Recorded participation in maintenance treatments ranged from 10% in Anjouan to 20.8%
in Moheli and 38.4% on Grande Comore. For optimum results, the rodent eradication program
should have been carried out on at least 50% of the houses. In retrospect, the work program of the
project was too ambitious. The reaction of the population to the presence of rodents, which have
been part of their life for a long time, was over-estimated. With respect to coconut stands, appraisal
estimates were also too optimistic. Out of a total of 8,000 ha of coconut plantations to be treated
during the course of the project, only a few trials were actually carried out. In conclusion, the rodent
control component of the project had a better implementation performance as control of a village pest
than a coconut pest. Three reasons contributed to the poor implementation of this component: the
high cost of bait; the fall of the world market price of copra; and rapid reinfestation. Where farmers
treated their coconuts and their neighbors did not, there was inevitably rapid reinfestation. The same
happened in the villages. Discouraged by continuous reinfestation, farmers who had started to treat
their coconut stands and their houses discontinued their efforts. A crash campaign to stimulate
farmers' interest in the continuation of rodent eradication, as recommended by IDA supervision
missions, was never carried out.
5.8        Copra marketing and processing. Of the 19 kilns planned under the project to help
alleviate the shortage of adequate copra drying installations, only one was built. It operated
successfully on a trial basis for a short period, but with the lack of copra export opportunities, it was



6
abandoned. None of the 10 sun-drying areas nor the 29 storage houses proposed to encourage and
promote copra marketing were built. The fall of the copra world market price and the slump in
demand were the main reasons for the complete failure of this component.
5.9        Project management. The Project Director, the Head of the Rodent Control Program,
the Head of the Copra Processing and Marketing component, the Project Accountant and the three
island Coordinators had all been appointed at the start of the project. One year later the Accc itant
was replaced because of lack of experience, while in 1982, the Head of the Copra Processing and
Marketing Service was fired for incompetence and his replacement not considered justified. The
recruitment of the other staff, including field technicians and extension agents, was completed within
the first year of the project. At later stages, the Project recruited more staff than needed, especially
laboratory staff and rodent control visual aids staff. This led to problems with salary payments. In
1986/87, all extension personnel were integrated with CEFADER.
5.10       The project's annual work plans were prepared regularly, as proposed, but semi-annual
and annual reports were either not provided at all or were prepared with long delays. Also problems
were noticed in the maintenance of records and in the monitoring procedures covering both the rodent
control and coconut rehabilitation components.
5.11       Training. Implementation of the training program was less than satisfactory. The
Project Director, the Head of the Copra Processing and Marketing component and the Head of the
Rodent Control component attended training courses abroad. Also, two field technicians were sent
to the Ivory Coast for two months for training in pollination techniques. Local training included
seminars for accountants, provided by the Finance/Administration adviser, a two-month seminar for
rodent control staff provided by the Technical Assistant, other seminars on coconut rehabilitation
procedures for extension agents, and regular extension service training sessions on extension methods
and technical messages to farmers. These training seminars were well attended, but had a limited
impact.
5.12       Technical assistance. The project called for technical assistance by three specialists
(coconut improvement, rodent control and finance) for a total of 90 man-months. A solution for the
coconut rehabilitation component i.e. a contract with IRHO for technical assistance through two or
three short missions per year of a high level specialist, who was not available for longer stays in the
Comoros, proved to be effective. On !DA's recommendation a similar contract was signed with the
French Institute of Agricultural Research (NRA) for the rodent control component. Technical
assistance for financial management was contracted to a specialized firm, which also performed
efficiently and provided extensive assistance to the project.
5.13       Studies and trials. This component envisaged the carrying out of surveys and trials to
determine the best planting methods, the most appropriate way to phase out old unproductive trees,
and also to conduct trials on fertilizers and on intercropping. Under the revised plant improvement
program the above proposals were changed. The new program included two types of actions: variety
trials and observation plots on smallholders' fields.
5.14       Four variety trials were established on the three islands in 1982, with the objective of
comparing the performance of PB121 and PBI 11 hybrids against two tall varieties of which one was
the local Comorian tall. One rate of chemical fertilizer was applied to all trees, but the proposed
fertilizer trials were not conducted. Instead, foliar analyses were carried out, which indicated soil
nutrient deficiencies. Comparisons of hybrids and local varieties were made under pure stand
conditions without any intercropping. The trial plots were kept in good condition and observations



7
by trained technicians were made regularly. However, maintenance of the plots, as well as
observations and recordings, were discontinued in 1988 because of financial problems. At the time
of the PCR all field trials were completely abandoned.
5.15       Establishmentof observation plots on farmers' land was very difficultto implement from
the beginning of the program: very few farmers accepted to participate in this activity. The majorlty
were reluctant to cut down old coconut trees and replace them with young, still unproductive trees
on pure stand. For this reason most of the observation plots were established on project grounds or
on Government land.
6.  rioect Results
6.1        Results. Despite poor performance on its physical implementation, the project obtained
some good technical results. Activities carried out at the Moheli seed garden and results from the
variety trials provided useful information on performance and potential of hybrids under local
conditions. PB121 hybrids started producing earlier than local varieties and reached full production
after S to 6 years. Furthermore, yields obtained were 50% above those of local varieties, and copra
and oil content were also 30% higher than that of the indigenous varieties. Information acquired by
the PCR mission through interviews with farmers who have planted hybrids has confirmed these
results. However, because of the reasons explained in section 5, the dissemination of hybrids could
not be carried out on a large scale and the impact of the project on overall coconut production was
thus negligible. Out of a total of 20,000 farmers, only about 1,300 have actually planted hybrids,
covering an area of 258 ha or 14% of appraisal target.
6.2        The rodent control component was appraised on the basis of conclusions reached by
IRHO in 1973, that coconut losses due to rodents were 37%. It was also assumed that appropriate
control techniques were available. Experience gained during the first three years of the project
showed that both assumptions were unrealistic. Preliminary conclusions indicated that losses indeed
occurred, but much less than assumed, and that rodent control, in the context of the Comoros, was
only marginally viable, especially on Grande Comore and Moheli. The technical viability was also
uncertain at the beginning of the project. The first trials, using locally produced maize mixed with
a liquid bait (chlorophacino), packed in a plastic bag rather than the recommended paraffin block,
were not as effective as expected, and alternative methods of rodent control had to be introduced,
starting in 1984. Although this program experienced some delays due to lack of funds, final results
proved highly effective. With the introduction of the new baits, as recommended by the INRA
specialist, rodent eradication in selected villages, reached a rate of disinfestation as high as 95%.
However, its economic viability remained doubtful. In addition, farmers had lost interest in rodent
control. No assessment of the impact on human health was ever carried out.
6.3        Under the copra processing and marketing component, 6,000 families were expected
to benefit from the project but implementat.on of this component never got underway. Furthermore,
the stabilization fund, envisaged at appraisal to ensure stable, remunerative copra prices reflecting
international prices, never became operational. It was abandoned because the Government could not
afford the working capital to operate the fund.
6.4        Economic rate of return. The Economic Rate of Return (ERR) for the project as a
whole was estimated by the appraisal mission at 13.9%. Separate ERRs were also calculated for the
rodent control and coconut rehabilitation components of the project, estimated at 33.3% and 10.0%



8
respectively. Because of substantial gaps in the data collected by CEFADER's ex-post baseline
survey, and the inadequacy of the data available to the PCR mission, it is not possible to estimate the
actual ERR. However, taking into consideration project results, which, as indicated above, were
much below appraisal expectations, it is reasonable to assume that the actual ERR is negative. The
same applies to the rodent control and coconut rehabilitation components separately.
7. Project Sustainability
7.1       It is almost certain that the institutional and physical infrastructure put in place wIll soon
cease to exist. The coconut seed garden and seed nurseries, for instance, which were designed to be
self-financing, are not maintained because of lack of farmers' interest to plant coconut hybrids. The
rodent control program was not sustainable since it failed to recover the cost of the operation, and
the Government is unable to provide adequate funding for it. At the time of the PCR mission in
1991, maintenance of project buildings and infrastructural works was nonexistent and many of the
project buildings were in bad condition and/or occupied by people who had no relationship with the
project's activities.
8. IDA Perfomanc
8.1        IDA's decision to support coconut rehabilitation in the Comoros was inappropriate, as
it failed to identify the economic factors behind the decline of copra production. The original project
design of the plant improvement component was completely changed at the start of implementation,
a change which IDA accepted without examnining possible disadvantages related to the introduction
of an unknown hybrid.
8.2       IDA assisted the Government in the identification and preparation of the project. Details
of staff inputs by IDA during identification, preparation, appraisal, negotiations and supervision are
provided in Part III, Table 8. A total of 16 IDA supervision missions visited the Comoros during
the project life to monitor implementation progress. The supervision missions were in general of a
high technical standard and their input useful. They were helpful in speeding up procurement, in
identifying main problems facing the project, in advising project management on how to solve them
and in continuously signalling to the Government and IDA the difficulties faced by the project and
the need to provide political and financial support. However, because little attention was paid to
economic and market aspects until the very end, IDA's efforts proved useless. Under the
circumstances, IDA should not have automatically extended the project by a total of two years. The
developmental impact of the project should have been given more attention.
9. Borrower Performance
9.1        There were considerable shortcomings in the performance of the Borrower during
project implementation, which seriously affected the project. The main weakness was the borrower's
inability to meet, in full, its funding commitments to the project. Also, the Borrower did not provide
detailed information on project results and actual project expenditures.
10. Consultants' Performance
10.1       The performance of the team of technical assistants was good.

of the data available to the PCR mission, it is not possible to estimate the ERR which the project is expected to
achieve. However, taking into consideration actual project results, it is reaonable to assume that the project
has atained a negative ERR.
