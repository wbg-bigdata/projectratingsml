HYDROPOWER REHABILITATION AND SYSTEM CONTROL PROJECT
I. SECTOR BACKGROUND
A. Country Context
1.1          Ukraine declared its independence from the Soviet Union in August 1991. It has a land
mass that is the largest in Europe (with the exception of European Russia) and a population of 52 million
that ranks fifth in Europe. GNP per capita was estimated at US$ 1,910 in 1993. The economy rests on
industry and agriculture, which together accounted for more than 70 percent of GDP in 1991. Ukraine,
despite its size, is also heavily dependent on trade, notably with the rest of the former Soviet Union
(FSU).
1.2          The economic decline in Ukraine has been dramatic. Real GDP contracted by 14 percent
in 1993, bringing the cumulative fall in output since 1990 to 38 percent. This trend accelerated in the
1994 as GDP declined by about 23 percent. Due to loose fiscal and monetary policies, the rate of
inflation rose to an average of 4,735 percent in 1993 (up from 1,210 percent in 1992), and, in addition,
varied significantly from month to month. In the first half of 1994, the inflation rate came down to single
digit levels, primarily on account of flagging demand, itself the result of a large drop in real wages and
a stringent credit policy. A freeze in the adjustment of administered prices (particularly energy) after
December 1993 also contributed to the slowdown in inflation.
1.3          The external situation has become increasingly tenuous, reflecting a significant trade
deficit with the FSU -- about US$ 3 billion in 1993 -- which was only partially offset by a trade surplus
with the rest of the world. Developments in external trade have been marked by a sharp contraction in
trade volumes, a considerable decrease in the terms of trade as import prices of energy moved towards
world levels, and a modest shift in the direction of trade away from the FSU towards the rest of the
world. The foreign trade deficit led to the increasing accumulation of arrears on payments for energy
imports.
1.4          While external shocks, mostly brought on by the collapse of the FSU, have contributed
to the economic decline, so too have the policies of the Government. Through 1993 and the first half
of 1994, these policies have been marked by the absence of a coherent macroeconomic stabilization and
structural reform program. A few disparate and uncoordinated attempts at stabilization have been
undertaken instead. The Government resorted to a number of administrative measures to manage the
economy. Price controls (including fixed administrative prices, advance notification of price adjustments,
and an array of controls on profit margins) were expanded; the state order system dominated the domestic
trade of key commodities; and export quotas and licenses remained widespread. Very little progress was
achieved in privatization, and, due to frequent changes in regulations and high taxes, the growth of the
emerging private sector took place outside the formal economy.
1.5          In July 1994, Ukraine elected a new President who called for a radical break from the
past in economic policies. A comprehensive program of macroeconomic stabilization and structural
reforms was developed with the assistance of the IMF and the World Bank. A series of difficult and far-
reaching measures were implemented in October 1994 to demonstrate the Government's commitment,
and the IMF approved a first purchase of US$ 365 million under the Systemic Transformation Facility
in support of the stabilization program. A Rehabilitation Loan (Ln. 3831-UA) of US$ 500 million was
approved by the Bank in December 1994 to support the implementation of structural reform measures
necessary to create the conditions for future economic growth led by a vibrant private sector.

1.6          The Government's program calls for accelerating the transition to a market-oriented
economy. Within this framework, the economic package that the Government has adopted aims to break
inflationary expectations and promote a sustained recovery in economic growth. To this end, the program
focuses on four key interdependent elements. First, a stable environment is required so that producers
and consumers can make sound decisions without fear of macroeconomic disruptions. The stabilization
of the economy will rest upon tight fiscal and monetary policies. Second, competition in markets is
essential to an efficient allocation of resources. In an effort to promote free and open markets, the
Government will rely upon the liberalization of prices and domestic and foreign trade; the dismantling
of the state order system; demonopolization; and promotion of the private sector. Third, the hardening
of enterprise budget constraints through corporatization, privatization and the enforcement of bankruptcy
laws will encourage enterprises to respond to the new market forces. The elimination of directed credits
and credits to settle inter-enterprise arrears and financial sector reform are expected to support behavioral
changes at the enterprise level. Finally, the social safety net is to be strengthened through improved
targeting in order to protect the segments of the population most vulnerable to the adjustments associated
with the structural transformation of the economy.
B. Overview of the Energy Sector
1.7          Energy Demand. Energy demand in Ukraine is characterized by high energy intensity
in relation to industrial output and the high share of industry in final energy consumption. This is due
to the high share of heavy industry (iron and steel, basic chemicals) and the low thermal efficiency of
energy consumption technologies. Energy consumption per capita was about 3,500 kilogram oil
equivalent (koe) in 1993, which is quite high even by Western European standards. Following a decline
of 11 % between 1985 and 1990, the energy intensity of GDP increased by 40% in the 1990-1993 period
reaching 2.5 koe/US$, a ratio that is several times higher than in the most developed countries.
1.8          Primary Energy Resources. Ukraine has large, practically unlimited coal resources.
Donbass, the main mining basin, contains metallurgical coal, anthracite and high grade thermal coals, as
well as coalbed gas. The unusually difficult geological conditions (thin, steeply inclined coal seams at
great depth) in the central Donbass make the mining of coal costly and labor intensive. Natural gas and
crude oil resources are declining, but are still significant. Remaining proven and probable reserves are
190 million tons of oil and 1,400 bcm of natural gas. The shallower and larger oil and gas pools in the
Dnieper-Donetsk and Carpathian regions are rapidly being depleted. These deposits are replaced by
reserves in smaller, deeper and less productive reservoirs, which are more expensive to find, to drill-up
and to produce, to the point that a large part of the reserves appear to be uneconomic.
1.9          Energy Supply. Domestic energy production, consisting of fossil fuels and primary
electricity (hydro- and nuclear power), represented 48 % of consumption in 1993-94 (see Table 1.1). The
main import items were crude oil and oil products, originating almost exclusively in Russia, and natural
gas, originating in Russia and Turkmenistan. The cost of fossil fuel imports reached US$ 5 billion in
1993 creating a demand for foreign exchange that the economy was only partly able to meet. In mid-
1993, Russia agreed to convert Rb 1.05 trillion of accumulated arrears to state debt of US$ 2.5 billion
repayable over a six-year period. In 1994, arrears for gas delivered in 1993 by Turkmenistan were
converted to a state debt of US$ 0.7 billion repayable over a seven-year period (including two years of
grace). In late 1993, Russia introduced advance payment for crude oil deliveries that contributed to an
almost 40 percent drop in Ukraine's crude oil imports in the following year. Gas deliveries, despite
Ukraine's continued inability to pay, were maintained in 1994 at levels comparable to the previous year,
leading once again to the accumulation of arrears.

Notes:   *A ton of oil equivalent is defined as 10 million kcal. The applied conversion factors are: coal - 0.5, crude oil - 1.0, peat & wood -
0.2, hydro & electricity - 0.25, natural gas - 0.85, petroleum products - 1.0.
1.10            By October 1994, arrears for gas imported from Russia and Turkmenistan reached US$
1.5 billion and US$0.7 billion, respectively. While Russia continued to deliver, Turkmenistan decided
to suspend the deliveries of gas. An agreement between Ukraine and Turknenistan signed in November
1994 stipulated that payments of US$300 million would be made to Turkmenistan to resolve part of the
arrears, and Ukraine would also compensate Turkmenistan for the cost of gas delivered in the fourth
quarter of 1994 (the rest of the arrears would be rescheduled to be paid over seven years, with 2 years
of grace). Negotiations with Russia are planned to be concluded in early 1995, and there are indications
that Russia will agree to convert a large part of the already accumulated arrears to debt.
1.11            Energy Prices. Gasoline, diesel oil and fuel oil prices are liberalized. Electricity, gas,
and coal prices are set by the central government. Local governments set the price of district heating,
LPG, heating oil, peat and wood. With the exception of electricity, household energy prices cover only

a fraction of costs. The difference is covered by central and local government budgets, and also by a
non-transparent surcharge on industrial consumers (for gas and district heat). Even for electricity, there
are several categories of households who are entitled to discounts, and the cost of these discounts is borne
by the industrial consumers. During most of 1994, additional price distortions were caused by: (i) a
subsidy to non-household consumers of coal; (ii) an artificial exchange rate that did not allow the passing
of the full cost of imported gas to consumers; and (iii) price adjustments for electricity and heat that
lagged behind fuel cost increases. Non-payment by customers became a major problem for electricity,
gas and heat suppliers, further weakening the financial position of the utilities. In October 1994, the
Government started the implementation of a program of price adjustments that: (i) drastically reduces
household energy price subsidies; (ii) eliminates the explicit and implicit (through the exchange rate)
subsidy to non-household consumers of coal and gas; and (iii) ensures the full recovery of increased fuel
and other basic input costs in the price of electricity and heat.
1. 12        Sector Institutions.  The sector is dominated by vertically integrated state owned
monopolies, controlled by the State Coal Committee, the Ministry of Power and Electrification
(Minenergo), the State Nuclear Energy Committee (Goskomatom) and the State Oil and Gas Committee.
In 1994, the Government started a corporatization prograrn in the oil, gas and power subsectors, with the
long term objective of privatizing those activities that are not natural monopolies (for more details on the
Government's program in the power industry, see Section D below). There are eight vertically integrated
state-owned regional utilities (Energos) under Minenergo. The regional utilities operate the regional
dispatch centers, portions of the transmission network, the thermal power plants, and the distribution
system. Two hydropower companies and the National Dispatch Center are directly under Minenergo.
Minenergo performs policy making and ownership, and also acts as a day-to-day utility business manager.
The concentration of the various, and in many ways conflicting, aspects of economic management in one
entity is a major obstacle to improving the efficiency and quality of electricity supply. Institutional
separation of the above functions, correction of fuel and electricity prices, commercialization of
enterprises, and promotion of competition are needed to establish the foundation for a modern, profitable
and efficient power industry.
1 .13        Employment. The energy sector employs almost 1 million people, or about 4.5 % of the
labor force. About 630 thousand are employed in coal mining, 140 thousand in the power industry, and
200 thousand in oil and gas production, refining, transport and distribution.
C. Power Industry Conditions and Priority Needs
1.14         Installed electricity generation capacity of the Ukrainian Power System (UPS) was 52,122
MW in 1993. It consisted of 12,818 MW of nuclear capacity, located in 5 plants with a total of 14 units
in operation. There were more than 40 thermal (fossil fuel) power plants with conventional steam cycle
technology, with over 110 generating units and a total capacity of 32,364 MW, of which 3,824 MW are
combined heat-and-power units. Hydro capacity was 4,700 MW, stationed mostly in 9 plants with a total
of 100 generating units. The capacity of industrial power plants was about 2,240 MW. The total
effective generating capacity of the system was about 50,000 MW, due to the derating of older plants.
Most older fossil fuel plants (about 23,000 MW) used coal as their primary fuel, but needed gas or mazut
for co-firing. About 5,520 MW of power generation as well as most of the combined heat-and-power
plants run on gas or mazut as main fuels.
1.15         Electricity generation was 228,316 GWh in 1993, of which thermal plants produced
135,875 GWh, nuclear plants 75,242 GWh, hydropower plants 11,214 GWh (including 200 GWh by a
pump storage plant), and industrial plants 5,985 GWh (see Table 1.2). Net export was 1,145 GWh (2708

GWh exports, 1,563 GWh imports). Self-consumption of thermal and hydro plants was 10,648 GWh (or
about 7.2% of their total generation), and of nuclear plants 5,228 GWh (6.9% of total nuclear
generation). After accounting for other production needs (615 GWh), consumption of the pump storage
plant (302 GWh), and transmission and distribution losses (22,473 GWh, or 9.8 % of total generation in
the system), net electricity consumption came to 187,905 GWh. The peak demand in 1993 occurred in
January, and was about 37,000 MW; the minimum demand, in June, was about 17,000 MW. Heat
production was about 48 million Gcal. Total fuel consumption for electricity and heat production was
53 million tons of reference coal equivalent (tce, defined as 7000 kcal/kg), consisting of 19.4 million tce
of natural gas, 7.3 million tce of mazut, and 26.3 million tce of coal.

1.16         Electricity generation, domestic consumption and exports have all declined significantly
in recent years. Between 1990 and 1994, generation decreased by 32 %, domestic consumption by 25 %,
and net exports by 96%. The decline in generation and consumption is likely to continue for some time
(see Annex 1). GDP, however, declined even more (by about 50% in the same period), and, as a result,
the electricity intensity of GDP increased from about 1.95 kWh/US$ in 1990 (that was already about 3.4
times the OECD average in that year) to 2.52 kWh/US$ in 1994.

1.17          The Ukrainian power industry was developed and operated as a part of the integrated
power system of the FSU. During the last 15-20 years, investment policy favored the use of natural gas
and nuclear power at the expense of coal-fired plants. The aging coal plants, whose performance was
further affected by declining coal quality, have to use mazut or gas as supplementary fuels despite sharp
increases in the price of imported oil and gas after the break-up of the Soviet Union. The total fossil fuel
consumption of the thermal power plants consisted of 43.1 mt of coal, 20.2 bcm of gas, and 4.9 mt of
fuel oil in 1993, representing, respectively, 45%, 20% and 50% of the domestic consumption of these
fuels.
1.18          Nuclear power plants account for 26% of installed generating capacity. The 14 Soviet-
designed operating units include two RBMK graphite moderated reactors at Chernobyl of 2 x 1000 MW
nameplate capacity.  The recommissioning of a third fire-damaged unit at Chernobyl is being
contemplated. Construction of three new nuclear units in Zaporozhye, Rovno and Khmelnitsky, each
1000 MW of capacity, is in progress at varying degrees of completion. Sunk investments costs and the
increasing costs of non-nuclear electricity generation are powerful incentives to complete these units. The
April 1986 Chernobyl accident brought to the forefront the issue of the safety of nuclear plants (see
Annex 2). The G-7 Summit Meeting held at Naples in July 1994 called for the phased closure of the
Chernobyl plant and outlined a broad Action Plan to this effect, including the completion of three new
nuclear reactor units to adequate safety standards, the rehabilitation of non-nuclear power plants, energy
policy reform, and energy efficiency measures. The Ukrainian Government agreed to work with the G-7
to develop the details of the Action Plan (see Section D below).
1.19          The forced separation of the UPS, in November 1993, from the hydro plants on the Volga
river that controlled system frequency, revealed some serious structural and functional weaknesses with
negative consequences on overall system operation, security, reliability and quality of power supply.
Most of the plants in the UPS are base-loaded, with limited load-following capabilities, and the system
lacks peaking and spinning reserve capacity. Inability of the UPS to maintain the balance of supply and
demand in real time, as measured by the system frequency and power flows through the interconnections
with the neighboring systems, led to the separation of all neighboring systems, causing further
deterioration of system performance and reduction in export capacity. The existing peaking capacity is
provided by the hydro plants that are old and in need of rehabilitation. A decrease in hydropower
capacity would lead to further deterioration in the reliability and quality of electricity supply. In view
of unmet load-following requirements and the high share of base-load plants, it is also necessary to
enhance the regulating capacity.
1.20          There are nine major hydropower plants in Ukraine, located on the two largest rivers,
Dnieper and Dniester, with more than 25 km3 of total active volume of the reservoirs. The total average
annual runoff of the rivers is 63.4 km3, the power capacity of the associated power plants is 4535 MW,
and the total electricity production is about 10,750 GWh. The reservoirs are mainly low-head structures,
with maximum heads ranging from 12 to 38.7 m. A cascade of eight plants is located on the Dnieper
river, and one plant is on the Dniester (with two new plants under construction). The reservoirs were
developed for multiple purposes. Operation of the reservoirs is, therefore, subject to many and often
competing requirements, but is, to a large extent, determined by the electricity generation needs. The
following summarizes the most important data:

1.21           The severely inadequate capacity to regulate frequency in Ukraine has led to frequency
levels that are not only unacceptable by international standards but also damaging to rotating electric
equipment both in the consumption and generation side. Sometimes frequency drops below 49.0 Hz,
while most well-operated systems would not allow frequency fluctuations of more than +/- 0.01 Hz.
Owing to the damage done to electric equipment by substandard frequency, nuclear plants are normally
taken out of service when frequency drops below a certain level (this is set at 49.0 Hz in Ukraine). Yet,
these plants are kept on-line, even when frequency falls below the set point, because the authorities are
loath to substitute lost nuclear plant with fossil fuel (more expensive) generation. Thus the safety of the
nuclear plants is compromised. Therefore, enhancing the system's ability to better balance supply and
demand, and improve frequency regulation, would have significant nuclear safety benefits.
1.22           The current control system consists of a hierarchical, four level dispatch and supervision
system, and local automatic control subsystems at various facilities. At the top level of the dispatch
system is the National Dispatch Center in Kiev, linked to the eight regional dispatch centers, to some
hydro plants, and to 750 kV and 330 kV substations. The regional dispatch centers are connected to
power plants located within their respective regions, and to the local distribution centers (27 in total).
They also control the local 330 kV network and 330/110 kV substations. At the lowest, fourth level, are
single generating units at the plants, and district distribution centers, connected with the local distribution
centers. The system operation planning procedures are generally adequate, although there is space for
improvements. Computer models are used for the analysis of system performance and optimization of
regimes. The software, most of which is not portable, has been developed mainly in the central institutes
of the FSU and delivered without the source codes and, therefore, cannot be maintained and upgraded
locally. The real-time operation of the system is controlled manually, using telephone connections
between dispatchers in central and regional dispatch centers, and plant and substations operators. The
existing data acquisition and communication system is incomplete, and largely obsolete. No automatic
generation control or automatic load control is used.  Although these weaknesses are somewhat
counterbalanced by the high technical competence of the staff, the weaknesses inevitably contribute to
the low quality of electricity supply and operation inefficiencies.
1.23           The power transmission and distribution networks in Ukraine operate at levels of 0.4, 6,
10, 20, 35, 110, 150, 220, 330, 400, 500, 750 kV AC; there is also an 800 kV DC link with Russia.
Transmission levels are defined as 330 kV and above, while 220 kV and lower voltage networks belong
to distribution. Ukraine has interconnections with Central Europe (capacity 2000 MW), Russia (3900
MW AC, 200/250 MW DC), Romania/Bulgaria (3500 MW), Belarus (1000 MW), with a total effective
power transfer capacity that exceeds 20% of the domestic generating capacity. In general, capacity of
the transmission network is sufficient, particularly under the current conditions of lower consumption and
reduced electricity trade. The 750 kV network was designed to become the main transmission network,
to serve Ukraine and to export electricity from Ukraine and Russia to Central Europe. Power flows
through Ukraine used to go from East to West, but now go in the opposite direction. Load on the 750

kV lines is often light, and there is a problem of compensating the reactive power the lines generate.
Other than for some local interventions (building a new substation instead of the one at Chernobyl,
connecting the Dniester Pump Storage Plant, still under construction, to the 750 kV lines), there does not
seem to be a need for major new additions to the network in the short-to-medium term.
1.24         Electricity demand is expected to drop even further before it starts growing again, due
to a number of factors such as the general economic downturn, electricity price increases and economic
restructuring (see Annex 1). An analysis of least-cost investment options was conducted for the 1995-
2010 period (see Annex 3). The analysis assumed that the Chernobyl units will be decommissioned in
the 1997-2001 period, and thermal power units of 1525 MW capacity are retired in the 1996-2002 period.
The safety upgrade of all nuclear units was also assumed (the upgrade requires each unit be taken off line
for one year). The simulation of system operation showed that the marginal cost of generation in the
peak period was about 60% higher than the marginal cost of generation at the minimal load. The
completion of a pump storage plant on the Dniester river was consistently part of the least cost solution,
suggesting that the system needs the peaking capacity provided by hydropower plants. This preliminary
analysis also indicated that completing the nuclear units that are in an advanced stage of construction is
justified, and that, after these units are commissioned, there is no need for additional capacity until 2008
(i.e., there will be a period of several years with significant capacity surplus in the system). Given that
some of the plants are quite old, it may be more cost-effective to retire them earlier than indicated in
Minenergo's current retirement plan. Those old coal-fired plants that are not retired and the hydropower
plants will need to be rehabilitated. More details are provided in Annex 3.
1.25         Total power generation investment requirements are preliminarily estimated at US$3.5
billion in the 1995-2005 period. Of this total, US$1.9 billion is needed for nuclear power, including US$
0.6 billion for safety upgrades, US$ 0.6 billion for decommissioning and other works at Chernobyl, and
US$ 0.7 billion for the completion of three new nuclear units. The rehabilitation of thermal and
hydropower plants and the partial completion of the Dniester PSP requires about US$ 1.6 billion. About
half of total investment costs would be incurred in foreign exchange.
1.26         Ukraine has a significant power engineering and manufacturing base. The "Turboatom"
and "Electrotyazhmash" factories in Kharkov, for example, were among the largest producers of turbines
and generators in the FSU, with exports to many countries. However, domestic production capability
for some categories, notably high-voltage equipment, advanced power generating technology (gas
turbines, modern coal-burning technology, environmental protection equipment), and instrumentation,
control, commnunications and computing equipment, is limited or non-existent. Also, there seems to be
limited expertise available in modern computer-based software and methodology for system control, as
well as for least-cost investment planning and economic dispatch.
D. Governnent Policy and Strategy in the Power Industry
1.27         In 1992-93, the Government's reaction to the increase in the price of energy imports and
cost of energy supply was to rely on the methods of central planning such as price controls, cross-
subsidization among consumer classes, and the rationing of energy, rather than allowing market
mechanisms to regulate and balance supply and demand. The principal reason, presumably, was concern
about the political risk of increased unemployment inherent in market based solutions. Another prominent
concern is dependency on one supplier, Russia, for half of Ukraine's primary energy needs.
1.28         In late 1993, the Government prepared a "Concept for the Development of the Energy
Sector of Ukraine for the Period up to 2010". The "Concept" was subsequently approved by the



Sector Background                                                                      9
Parliament. It spelled out the following main directions for Ukraine's long-term energy strategy: (i) the
development and implementation of a policy that promotes energy savings; (ii) economically and
environmentally justified utilization of domestic energy sources; (iii) restructuring of the economy that
reduces the energy intensity of production; and (iv) increasing reliance on alternative (renewable) energy
sources. The investment program outlined in the "Concept" recognized the priority of rehabilitating
capacities in the power, coal, gas and oil subsectors, however, it also included a number of ambitious
expansion schemes in coal mining, oil and gas production, and nuclear power generation.
1.29         In early 1994, the Parliament passed a Law on Energy Conservation. The Law provided
economic incentives for investments in energy conservation, including subsidies and earmarked loans.
Specifically, it called for the establishment of national and local extra-budgetary energy conservation
funds to support energy saving initiatives (however, it failed to specify the revenue sources of the funds).
The Law also contained a number of command-and-control type provisions such as penalties for "above
the norm" energy use.
1.30         "The Complex Program for the Modernization and Development of Fuel and Power
Industry of Ukraine for the Period up to 2010" prepared by Minenergo in 1992 (and revised in 1994)
focussed on the rehabilitation of thermal and hydropower plants in the 1995-2000 period. In addition to
extending the life of these plants, rehabilitation would be aimed at maximizing the use of domestic coal,
and improving plant reliability and environmental performance. Planned investments in new capacity in
the same period would include the completion of pump storage and nuclear plants currently under
construction. In order to meet the assumed increase in demand for electricity after 2000 (see Annex 1),
the "Complex Program" recommended the construction of additional nuclear and thermal power units
while continuing the rehabilitation and modernization of existing thermal and hydropower plants.
1.31         Both the "Concept" and the "Complex Program" included extensive measures to upgrade
the safety of nuclear power plants. The "Complex Program" assumed that the two remaining units of
the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant would be closed when their reactor channels reach the end of their
life in 1998-2003. During discussions with the G-7 Nuclear Safety Working Group, the Government
agreed to consider the possibility of the early closure of the Chernobyl plant provided that a solution was
found for a set of related issues, such as the financing of replacement nuclear capacity, closure costs, and
the mitigation of social consequences. It was agreed that an international Task Force would be formed
from Ukrainian and foreign experts with the task of developing a detailed, comprehensive Action Plan
for nuclear safety in the context of a power sector development strategy (see Annex 2). The joint
international Task Force was set up in December 1994, and its work is underway.
1.32         On May 21, 1994, the President of Ukraine signed Decree 244/94 on Market
Transformation Measures in the Electricity Sector of Ukraine (see Annex 4/A). The Decree ordered a
broad restructuring of the power industry based on the United Kingdom's model of separating generation,
transmission, and distribution functions, corporatizing and privatizing the generating and distribution
companies, setting up a competitive wholesale market for electricity, and establishing an independent
agency to regulate the industry (i.e., independent from the enterprises and not subordinated to any
Ministry). After some initial delay, the Government adopted an Action Plan to implement the Decree
on November 2, 1994 (see Annex 4/B). As a first step, a National Electricity Regulatory Commission
was established in December 1994. The Commission is expected to take over the regulation of electricity
prices from the Ministry of Economy in May 1995. Full implementation of the Decree is expected to
increase the efficiency and reliability of electricity supply, restore the financial health of the industry, and
create a favorable framework for private investment (including equity participation) in power generation.

1.33         In response to the growing problem of interenterprise arrears, the President of Ukraine
signed a Decree on October 12, 1994 ordering electricity and gas suppliers to agree on a schedule for
the reduction of arrears with their customers.  The Decree created an Interministerial Operative
Commnission to supervise the fulfillment of these agreements, and to ensure that supplies are maintained
to the highest priority customers in the critical winter period. The electricity and gas suppliers are
required to report non-payments to the Operative Commission, and the Commission's task is to take
appropriate steps to remedy the situation, including ordering the utilities to reduce or discontinue service
to delinquent customers.
E. Bank Strategy and Experience
1.34         The Bank's overall objective is to support Ukraine's efforts to accelerate structural
reforms, and to promote efficient investments in high priority sectors in order to complete the transition
of the country to a market economy, accelerate the rate of economic growth, and increase efficiency.
This will require strengthening key financial institutions; accelerating privatization; extending the
openness of the policy environment; rehabilitating and re-orienting its physical infrastructure; and
extending the social safety net and the efficient delivery of social services. This cannot and need not be
done at the expense of the stabilization effort; in fact, many efficiency measures such as infrastructure
cost recovery are likely to be revenue enhancing.
1.35         The Bank approved the first loan for US$27 million equivalent to Ukraine in June 1993
(Ln. 3614-UA) to finance an Institution Building Project aimed at supporting enterprise reform, financial
sector reform, and public economic and financial management. Initially, the implementation of the
project suffered from the unstable policy environment in Ukraine. Major bottlenecks have been: (i)
Ukraine's inexperience with Bank policies and procurement procedures; (ii) the project structure (three
components and eight implementing agencies, many different Bank staff involved); (iii) lack of guidance
from an understaffed and demotivated Implementation Unit; and (iv) an adverse attitude toward
interagency collaboration within the Ukrainian government.  Institutional rearrangements and the
improved policy environment significantly improved the performance of the project in late 1994.
1.36         The second Bank operation is a Rehabilitation Loan (Ln. 3831-UA) of US$500 million
equivalent approved in December 1994. The Loan provides financing for critical imports needed to stem
the decline in production and to cushion the deterioration of living standards of the population.
1.37         The Bank has been involved in the Ukrainian energy sector since early 1992. An Energy
Sector Review (Report No. 11646-UA) was issued in 1993, leading to an Energy Strategy Conference
held in Kiev in June 1993. During the Conference, an understanding was reached that the Bank would
focus on power generation, gas transmission, and gas distribution, since these were the subsectors where
the the Bank's contribution to policy development and financing of priority investments could make a
significant difference. It was also determined that lending operations should aim at the rehabilitation of
existing assets rather than capacity expansion, while supporting initiatives that increase the financial and
operational autonomy of enterprises and foster competition. Immediately after the Conference, the
Government, assisted by the Bank and other multi- and bilateral agencies, started the preparation of a
number of projects to rehabilitate hydropower plants, thermal power plants, gas transmission lines, and
gas distribution and metering facilities. In 1993-94, the Bank also assisted the Government to prepare
projects for coalbed methane utilization and district heating end-user efficiency improvements for possible
financing under the greenhouse gas reduction initiative of the Global Environment Fund. The Bank
recognizes that it will not be able to provide all the required foreign exchange to the power industry.
Additional funding will be needed from other sources such as EBRD, suppliers' credit and private investors.



Sector Background                                                                        11
1.38         Utilizing trust funds, the Bank provided technical assistance in the areas of industrial
energy audits, rehabilitation of thermal and hydropower plants, gas distribution and metering, legislation
for oil and gas production, and power industry institutional reform. Decree 244/94 (see above) is one
of the regulatory and legislative acts that benefitted from these technical assistance activities. Following
the approval of the Decree, the Bank, jointly with Minenergo, organized a donor meeting in Kiev in July
1994. The purpose of the meeting was to ensure the availability of adequate technical assistance for the
implementation of this important reform initiative in the power subsector. The donors offered technical
assistance of about US$4 million equivalent for the first year of the reform (including US$450,000 from
the Bank's Institutional Development Fund), and asked the Bank to assist the Government to coordinate
the implementation of the technical assistance program. The proposed project would both capitalize on
the reforms undertaken under the Decree, and provide leverage for its further implementation.
1.39         The Bank has been actively supporting the dialogue between the G-7 and the Government
of Ukraine in the area of nuclear safety. In collaboration with EBRD, the Bank assisted the G-7 Nuclear
Safety Working Group to develop an Action Plan that includes the phased closure of capacity at
Chernobyl, the completion of replacement nuclear capacity, the safety upgrade of the remaining nuclear
units, the rehabilitation of non-nuclear power plants and energy efficiency improvements. The Bank is
also actively participating in the work of a joint Ukraine/G-7 Task Force (para. 1.31) that is entrusted
with the technical preparation of the details of the Action Plan. Although the Bank will not finance
nuclear power investments, the Bank's support for pricing and institutional reforms is an important
contribution to the establishment of a framework that will facilitate the implementation of the Action Plan.
Furthermore, such projects as the proposed Hydropower and System Control Project, which will also
positively affect the safety of the operation of the nuclear plants (para. 3.24), and the planned Thermal
Power Rehabilitation Project, are key elements of the Action Plan.
1.40         A review of several decades of the Bank's worldwide lending for the power industry
found a declining trend in the industry's pricing, financial, technical and institutional performance, mainly
due to governmental failure to address the industry's fundamental structural problems ("The World Bank's
Role in the Electric Power Sector", World Bank Policy Paper, Washington DC, 1993). Conflicts between
the government's role as owner and its role as operator of utilities have led to poorly defined objectives,
government interference in daily affairs, and a lack of financial autonomy. The review recommended
that Bank lending for electric power should focus on countries with a clear commitment to improving the
performance of the power industry by commercialization, corporatization and the establishment of a
transparent regulatory framework. The Bank's experience in power rehabilitation is limited since there
were very few purely rehabilitation projects. To the extent that rehabilitation components can be
evaluated separately, performance has been satisfactory.

II. THE PROJECT
A. Project Concept and Objectives
2.1           The Bank's Power Demand and Supply Options study issued in 1993 (Report No. 11561-
UA) examined a number of supply scenarios to meet projected electricity demand in the 1994-2010
period. The study found that, apart from the completion of the nuclear power and pump storage units
already under construction, no new generation capacity is needed, and the rehabilitation of thermal and
hydropower plants was likely to result in the most significant net benefits. Based on this finding,
feasibility studies were initiated to prioritize Minenergo's thermal and hydropower rehabilitation programs
and to prepare projects that could be financed by development banks. The hydropower study also
included assessments of the Dniester Pump Storage Plant (PSP) and system-wide control and dispatch
facilities. The studies were carried out by consultants whose activities were facilitated and supervised
by counterpart teams appointed by Minenergo. The services of the consultants were financed from trust
funds provided by the Government of Netherlands and the Government of Switzerland.
2.2           The draft final reports for the two studies were submitted to Minenergo and the Bank- in
early September 1994. The hydropower study (prepared by SGI Engineering Ltd) identified high priority
investments to rehabilitate the hydropower plants and to upgrade system control facilities. In addition,
it also recommended the completion of the Dniester PSP. However, the preparation of the Dniester PSP
lacked a proper environmental impact assessment and there was a need to revise the implementation
schedule to take into account the expected availability of funds.
2.3          The results of the feasibility studies were reviewed in detail by Minenergo and the Baik.
It was agreed that the Government would: (i) request a loan for a Hydropower Rehabilitation and Systeril
Control Project; and (ii) continue the preparatory work on thermal power rehabilitation and thi
completion of the Dniester PSP for eventual consideration for financing by the Bank. The appraisal ot
the project took place in September/October 1994.
2.4           The objectives of the project are to: (i) improve the efficiency, reliability, safety and
environmental performance of hydropower plants; (ii) increase hydropower generation capacity; (iii)
improve the quality of electricity supply by upgrading load and frequency control, which would also
improve the safety of nuclear plants; and (iv) reduce fuel costs by facilitating the economic dispatch of
generating units.
B. Project Description
2.5           The project includes the following four components:
(a)    The initial 5 years of the hydropower rehabilitation program outlined in the feasibility
study, including the implementation of the complete rehabilitation program for the
Dnieper I and Dnieper II hydropower plants and the Kiev PSP; near-complete
implementation of the rehabilitation program for the Kakhovka HPS; and partial
implementation of the rehabilitation program for the Kiev, Kanev, Kremenchug and
Dniprodzerzhinsk hydropower plants;
(b)    Installation of dam safety monitoring systems at the main water reservoirs on the Dnieper
river (Kiev, Kanev, Kremenchug, Dnieper, Dniprodzerzhinsk, Kakhovka);



The Project                                                                                13
(c)    Upgrade of communications, dispatch, system control and protection, and generating unit
control; and
(d)    Technical assistance for project implementation, and optimization of the use of the
reservoirs on the Dnieper river.
2.6           Rehabilitation of Hydropower Plants.  Hydropower plants play a critical role in
regulating peak load and system frequency.  Most of the existing plants are old and in need of
rehabilitation (eight of the nine main hydro plants are older than 20 years; five are older than 30 years;
the oldest plant, Dnieper I, was built in 1932 and then reconstructed in 1947). Many units have problems
with turbine runners and governors, generator windings and auxiliaries, oil leakage, substations circuit
breakers, load control, and instrumentation and control systems. This has lead to increased operating and
maintenance costs, derating of the units, and lower efficiency and availability.  Allowing further
deterioration would increase costs, worsen the capacity mix, and further reduce the already insufficient
regulating capability of the system.
2.7           The work involves:
Replacement of turbine runners, turbine governors, and replacement, rehabilitation or
upgrade of other related equipment (guide vanes, runner chambers, shafts, servomotors
measuring and control devices) at the Kiev, Dnieper I and Kakhovka plants. Only eight
out of twenty turbines at the Kiev plant will be rehabilitated due to the limited capaciiv
of the turbine manufacturer (the Kharkhov turbine factory, which produced most of tc
original turbines for the plants); the other twelve will be included in the second phase of
the rehabilitationprogram. Four out of six turbines will be rehabilitated at the Kaklrovl.d
HPS, where only one tubine at a time can be taken out. At the Dnieper I HPS. all
turbines will be included in the project.  Rehabilitation of one turbine both at
Kremenchug and Dniprodzerzhinsk plants will also be included.
*      Rehabilitation of generators including replacement, rehabilitation or upgrade of stator and
rotor windings, magnetic static core, generator circuit breakers, excitations and cooling
systems, voltage transformers and electrical protection.  All the generators that are
associated with rehabilitated turbines will be rehabilitated too; in addition, generators at
the Kiev PSP and Dnieper II, where no turbines are planned for rehabilitation, will also
be included in the project. All generator circuit breakers will be replaced in all plants.
*      Rehabilitation of switchyards and related equipment (step-up transformers, circuit
breakers, isolators and earthing switches, HV instruments and protection, current and
voltage transformers) at the Dnieper I, Dnieper II, Kakhovka, Kremenchug,
Dniprodzerzhinsk and Kiev plants, and the Kiev PSP.
*      Upgrading of control and monitoring equipment at the Dnieper I, Dnieper II, Kakhovka
and Kiev plants, and the Kiev PSP. The work consists of rehabilitating, replacing or
upgrading instruments for monitoring temperature, vibrations, generator air gap, water
discharge, and equipment for local, unit and plant-level control.
2.8           Installation of Dam Safety Monitoring Systems. Reservoirs on the Dnieper river were
developed with multiple uses in mind. In addition to hydropower generation, the reservoirs are used for



14                                                                                 The Project
flood control, irrigation, industrial and drinking water supply, shipping, fisheries, tourism. Because of
the configuration of the terrain, the reservoirs are low head structures with long embankments. Some
of them have long dykes protecting the surrounding land from being flooded. The project includes
measures to rehabilitate and upgrade the existing dam monitoring systems for about 100 km of dams and
dykes for the reservoirs on the Dnieper river. The work will include dam safety investigation, and
rehabilitation and upgrade of the existing, as well as installation of new instrumentation (primarily
pressure, motion and moisture sensors, water levels, etc.), drainage structures and alarm systems. Data
collection, analysis and storage, automation and centralization of the readings where justified, will also
be considered.  Procedures for dam safety monitoring and emergencies will be reviewed and, if
necessary, improved, including emergency response, evacuation and training programs.
2.9           Upgrade of Communications, Dispatch and System Control. Low level of automation
across the entire UPS, outdated and inadequate protection, control, metering, communication and
computing equipment compromise system operation. At present, the frequency is regulated manually,
but deviations below 49.3 occur during the peak hours, and above 50.2 Hz during the low load hours (for
comparison, the UCPTE standard requires the system frequency to be maintained at 50.0 Hz within the
band of + or - 0.01 Hz). The response time of primary regulation is slow. The governors have large
dead bands, and were made using old technology with hydraulic amplifiers and vacuum tubes. Load
following scheduling is also done manually, rather than by computer-based economic dispatch, resulting
in extra fuel costs. Production scheduling of hydro generators, which are all peaking units, is controled
manualy. The control of power flows across interconnections with the neighboring systems is subject to
similar problems as the control of frequency (manual control, unstable voltage conditions), creating major
obstacles to reintegrating the UPS with its neighbors. Isolated operation, in addition to preventing the
trade of electricity, also reduces reliability, security and quality of supply, and is more expensive as it
requires a larger reserve capacity.  The operation of the planned power pool (the spot market for
electricity) will require the improved metering of interconnections, generating plants, power supply
companies and wholesale customers. Bids and availability forecasts from the generators will have to be
collected and evaluated. The data acquisition and communication system must be able to support the real-
time operations of the pool by providing accurate and timely information for production scheduling,
billing and compensation of the pool members.
2.10          The following measures are designed to answer the above problems:
*      Upgrading of generating unit governors: in addition to the new governors installed at the
hydro plants (included as a component in the hydropower rehabilitation program), new
governors will be installed at a number of thermal generating units. The governors will
be equipped for manual, local automatic and remote control allowing the implementation
of real-time economic dispatch by the National Dispatch Center.
*      Upgrade of plant protection, plant dispatch and generation control equipment at the
Dniester hydropower plant.
*      Upgrade of protection systems for the high-voltage transmission lines.
*      Installation of the necessary computing equipment to support automatic generation control
and economic dispatch at the National Dispatch Center.
*      Upgrading the data acquisition and transmission systems at the National Dispatch Center,
the Regional Dispatch Centers, and at a number of generating plants and important



The Project                                                                           15
substations by installing modem remote terminal units and more powerful computer
systems. The upgrade will increase volume and frequency of data available to the
dispatchers enabling better monitoring of the system and more timely reactions, and allow
the implementation of automatic generation control and economic dispatch functions, as
well as effective functioning of pool operations. The system will be implemented as a
modular, open architecture system, which can be expanded in stages.
Upgrading the communication system by replacing the existing links representing the
most serious bottlenecks. The communication system is essential for the real-time control
and operation of the power network. The existing analog system has serious limitations.
The communication lines (cables, power line carriers and radio) are old, unreliable,
susceptable to noise corruption, and increasingly difficult to maintain. The bandwidth
of the communications links is not adequate. Given the size of the Ukrainian power
system and the corresponding communication requirements, this component will be
designed to enable functioning of the new SCADA and automatic frequency control
systems, laying down elements of the new communication system which will be gradually
expanded over time.  Detailed proposals for the location and type of the new
communication lines will be determined in the detailed engineering design stage in
conjunction with engineering specifications of the SCADA and automatic frequency
control systems.
2.11         International Waterways. The Dniester hydropower plant is about 15 km upstream from
the point where the river forms the borderline between Moldova and Ukraine. There is no dispute
between the two countries concerning the operation of this plant. Upgrading of the dispatch and
generation control equipment for this plant will not affect the reservoir nor any other water retaining
structure, and will have no effect on the flow of the river.
2.12         Technical Assistance. Project implementation support will compensate for the limited
experience of the beneficiaries in international procurement and the management of foreign contractors.
It will include support for preliminary detailed engineering design, technical specifications, bidding
document preparation, bids evaluation, contract negotiations, contract administration, cost control,
schedule monitoring and coordination, establishment of communication and documentation procedures,
supervision of detailed design development, construction inspections, inspections in manufacturers'
facilities, quality control, system checkout and integration in factory and on site, factory and field
acceptance tests, and other project implementation services. The technical assistance will also include
review of the existing procedures in managing the river basin reservoirs for the Dnieper river, and
proposals for the improvements, if necessary. Training will be included in the tender documents for the
supply of equipment. In addition, training will be provided in project management and procurement.
It is estimated that 160 man-months of internationally recruited, and 526 man-months of local consulting
services will be needed.
C. Project Context
2.13         The components of the project were chosen to address some of the most pressing
problems in the Ukrainian power system, and to maximize the impact of the Bank's contributions. The
least cost power investment plan includes the rehabilitation of a number of existing thermal and
hydropower plants, and the completion of three nuclear units and the pumped storage plant that are
already in an advanced stage of construction (see Annex 3). The proposed project is in accordance with
the Bank's energy strategy which aims at promoting energy efficiency improvements and adaptation of



16                                                                                     The Project
energy utilities to the requirements of a market economy (see Energy Sector Review, Report No. 11646-
UA). Increased efficiency in electricity generation will reduce fuel costs and improve the balance of
payments. The improved quality of electricity supply, a basic input for production, will facilitate the
modernization of Ukraine's industry. By increasing the efficiency of electricity generation, this project
is consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy.  Together with the planned Thermal Power
Rehabilitation Project, the proposed project demonstrates that the Bank is willing to step up assistance
to those sectors of the economy that are committed to reform. This is particularly important at this time
when the power industry is making the first bold reform steps. The Bank's involvement is regarded as
important in supporting the implementation of high priority investments under the present conditions of
severe resource constraints. By rehabilitating and upgrading facilities that utilize a renewable resource,
the project is consistent with the objective of environmentally sustainable development. Finally, the
project is also consistent with the nuclear safety initiative of the G-7 since it supports the continued
utilization of a low-cost alternative source of power, and improves the safety of existing nuclear units by
reducing fluctuations in frequency.
D. Environmental Aspects
2.14           The impact of the hydropower rehabilitation component (environmental category "B") was
reviewed during the preparation of the feasibility study. Other project components were placed in
category "C", not requiring specific environmental analysis. The main environmental problem detected
by the enviromnental analysis carried out for the feasibility study was excessive leakage of lubricating
oil from turbine runner blade seals. The study recommended the control of water pollution through the
rehabilitation of turbines, and also identified the need for improved water management, and improved
instrumentation and procedures related to dam safety. The conceptual design and structural stability of
water retaining structures were found to be satisfactory.
2.15           During implementation, the project is not expected to impose any costs on the
environment. Reservoir structures will not be subject to any work. There will be no activities that would
result in a significant impact on the existing patterns of water flows and water usage. Environmental
benefits will come from three sources: (i) the rehabilitation of turbines; (ii) the rehabilitation and upgrade
of dam safety systems; and (iii) economic dispatch. The turbines of which the runners will be replaced
were built between 1947 and 1964. The rehabilitated turbines are expected to have improved and longer-
lasting sealing, which should significantly reduce or eliminate the leakage. In addition, improved turbine
efficiency will lead to more hydro energy produced. Since the marginal source of power in Ukraine is
fossil fuel, this will translate to reduced fossil fuel use with corresponding environmental benefits.
Improved dam safety monitoring will reduce the risks of accidents and allow for improved water
management and control, which will also take environmental aspects into account. Introduction of
automatic generation control and economic dispatch will lead to a more efficient use of fossil fuel plants,
resulting in commensurate reduction in fossil fuel use and the corresponding emission of pollutants.
E. Cost Estimates and Financing
2.16           Project Costs. The total cost of the project is estimated at US$190.2 million equivalent,
of which US$106.7 million is in foreign exchange. Cost estimates are based on September 1994 prices.
Physical contingencies were estimated at 15% of base costs. Price contingencies for foreign costs were
estimated using a constant price increase of 2.2% per year. Price contingencies for local costs were
estimated assuming that the currently low domestic prices would increase in real terms in the future.
Assumptions on domestic inflation and exchange rate are given in para. 3.11. Based on information from
the Ministry of Finance that imports under the proposed project would be exempt from import duties and

2.17          Project Financing. The proposed World Bank loan of US$114.0 million would cover
50% of project costs, plus US$18.3 million of interest during construction (the foreign exchange
component of total interest during construction estimated at US$ 24.1 million equivalent). Following a
five year grace period, repayment of the principal and interest payments would commence and continue
for 12 years. The Borrower would be Ukraine, whose Government would enter into subloan agreements
with the beneficiaries.   The beneficiaries would be the National Dispatch Center and  the
Dniprohydroenergo (DHE), a joint stock company that includes the hydropower plants on the Dnieper
river. During negotiations, the delegation confirmed that the loan proceeds would be on-lent to the
beneficiaries. The subloans would have a maturity of 1 7years includingfive years of grace. The interest
rate in the subloan agreements would be equal to the World Bank's standard variable interest rate plus
a margin of 1. 5 % to cover the cost of loan administration. The foreign exchange risk will be borne by
the beneficiaries. The beneficiaries would also reimburse the Government for the commitment fee (para.
6.1.a). The signing of the subloan agreements would be a condition of loan effectiveness (para. 6.2.a).
2.18          The Government of Switzerland will provide a grant of US$10.5 million to finance part
of the cost of the hydropower rehabilitation component and related technical assistance services. The
proceeds of the Swiss grant (except the technical assistance component) will be on-lent to DHE at terms
that are similar to the terms in the above subloan agreements. The Government of Canada will provide
grant financing for technical assistance for project preparation, procurement and project implementation
for the first year (1995), in the amount of US$ 1.8 million. The Government of Norway will finance
the water management component of technical assistance in the amount of US$0.6 million, also on a grant
basis. DHE and NDC will finance the remaining costs, part of interest during construction, and the
commnitment fee, estimated at US$88.3 million equivalent, from internally generated revenues. Financing
arrangements are shown in Table 2.2.

III. FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A. Electricity Prices
3.1    Electricity prices for residential consumers and the average price of electricity are set by the
Ministry of Economy. Electricity prices for non-residential consumers (within the prescribed average)
are set by Minenergo following the approval of the Ministry of Economy. Although the average nominal
price of electricity increased almost 50 times (on average) in 1993, when expressed in a convertible
currency, the price remained very low (see Table 3.1). Significant real increases occured in 1994 and
early 1995, almost fully eliminating the gap between the average price (UScent 2.5/kWh equivalent in
March 1995) and the economic cost of electricity (estimated at UScent 3.0/kWh)'. The prices cover the
operating cost of the industry, and the difference between the average price and the economic cost is
mostly due to the relatively low cost electricity produced by hydropower plants.

3.2            Hydropower companies sell their output to the National Dispatch Center (NDC) under
a two-part, cost-based rate structure designed to recover operating costs and capital expenditures,
including a pre-determined profit margin. Hydropower costs are generally low, although tariffs vary
significantly from one hydropower company to the next, reflecting differences in capital costs and
social/community infrastructure. Minenergo adjusts rates for the sale of hydropower to NDC on a
monthly basis. The cost of hydropower constitutes a small item (less than 1 %) in the overall retail
electricity tariff. In March 1995, NDC's average cost of purchasing power from the hydropower
companies was Krb 542/kWh (UScent 0.5/kWh equivalent). NDC paid Krb 1,860/kWh for the output
of nuclear plants, and sold the electricity purchased from the nuclear and hydropower plants to the eight
regional associations at a price of Krb 1,900/kWh. The regional associations combined this with the
electricity produced in their own thermal power plants, added the cost of transmission and distribution,
and sold the electricity to the public at an average price of Krb 3,105/kWh.
3.3            After an eight-fold increase that was implemented on March 1, 1995, retail electricity
prices were set at Krb 3,500/kWh for urban, Krb 3,000/kWh for rural households, and Krb 2,300/kWh
for households who rely on electrical stoves and space heaters (see Table 3.2). Several categories of
households (e.g., veterans, Chernobyl victims) are entitled to substantial discounts. The tariff for rural
households and electric stoves/heaters inverted the cost structure, since the supply of electricity to
households is generally more expensive due to a number of factors (e.g., household consumption
coincides with peak demand, higher distribution losses, etc). Additional distortions are caused by the lack
of time-of-day, seasonal and regional differences in electricity prices (only the capacity charge for large
industrial consumers differed regionally).
1      The low economic cost (in international comparison) is explained by (i) decreasing electricity demand resulting in
surplus capacity; (ii) access to relatively low cost imported fuels; and (iii) low labor costs.

3.4           The Government of Ukraine indicated in its Memorandum of Economic Reform Policies,
supported by the Rehabilitation Loan (Ln. 3831-UA), that wholesale electricity prices would be set by
the market by the end of 1995. Building on the existing national dispatch operation, the wholesale
electricity market (Energomarket) will allow thermal generators to submit bids for the sale of electricity
to the "pool" in each hour of the day. Those bids will be accepted which allow demand to be served at
minimum cost. A national wholesale price for the electricity generated by thermal plants, equal to the
highest accepted bid plus a margin ("uplift") to finance the operating cost of NDC, and certain other
costs, will be formed each hour, and charged to the local electricity companies and to those large
industrial consumers, who participate in demand side bidding and purchase electricity directly from the
pool. All entities who purchase from the "pool" will pay an additional transmission fee based on the cost
of delivering electricity to their respective locations.
3.5           Nuclear and hydropower plants will not participate in supply side bidding.  NDC
(Energomarket) will continue to buy electricity from the nuclear and hydropower plants on the basis of
contracts that will ensure the optimal dispatch of their capacity and full recovery of their costs. Local
electricity companies will be allocated a share of this low cost electricity. The operation of the wholesale
market, the prices paid to the nuclear and hydropower companies, and the formulation of retail electricity
prices will be regulated by the National Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) that was established
in December 1994.
B. Past Financial Performance of the Implementing Agencies
3.6           National Dispatch Center.  NDC is the sole purchaser of output from Ukraine's
hydropower and nuclear plants. This output is resold to Ukraine's eight regional power companies, who
currently engage in both distribution and thermal power generation, and to a few large industrial concerns
that purchase power directly from NDC. NDC's resale tariffs are determined by Minenergo and reflect
certain cross-subsidies that cause tariffs to vary from one regional company to the next. Overall, NDC's
average resale tariff is designed to cover its cost of service -- a goal that has not been fully achieved
during the recent years of high inflation and accumulating payment arrears. Had NDC been collecting
its accounts receivable in a timely manner, its resale tariffs would have been adequate and it would be
in a stable financial position today.



Financial and Economic Analysis                                                          21
3.7           NDC's revenue stream depends almost entirely upon payments by the regional power
companies (Energos). These companies are in serious financial difficulty and have amnassed substantial
arrears to their suppliers, including NDC. Accounts receivable at the end of the third quarter of 1994
were approximately US$49.5 million at the then-applicable exchange rate of 68,000 Krb/US$. The
average age of NDC's receivables is about 60 days, down from 96 days in 1993. This improvement was
entirely attributable to inflationary devaluation of receivables. Many of NDC's outstanding 1994
receivables were recorded when the exchange rate was around 45,000/US$, and the company had, as of
September 30, 1994, suffered an economic loss of over US$25 million from the devaluation of its
uncollected receivables. Accounts receivable make up more than 99% of NDC's current assets; cash
balances in bank accounts are only about US$ 0.2 million equivalent.
3.8           Delays in collection left NDC unable to pay its own suppliers in a timely manner.
Devaluation of these payables created an inflationary gain of US$ 13 million as of September 30, 1994,
partially compensating for NDC's inflationary losses on receivables. NDC's gains from inflation were
substantially less than its losses because its payable balances were approximately 52% of its receivables,
and NDC's delay in making payments was less than its delay in collecting customer accounts (36 days
versus 60 days in 1994). Roughly 2.5% of NDC's current liabilities reflect amounts owed to hydropower
stations; 97.5% reflects debt for purchases of nuclear power. NDC is not encumbered with any short-
term borrowing.
3.9           NDC's situation reflects the broader problems in Ukraine's power industry:
*     In most of 1993 and in the first nine months of 1994, retail electricity tariffs lagged
behind fuel price increases, remaining too low even to fully reimburse operating costs,
let alone capital items and a profit margin; and
*     On average, 22% of the regional companies' billings to retail customers have not been
paid in a prompt manner since 1992. Because of high inflation, deferred payments
effectively spelled non-payment, given a legal framework that prevented the application
of interest charges and penalties to unpaid customer balances.
3.10          Hydropower plants. The hydropower plants had a relatively modest cash-flow problem
almost entirely attributable to delayed payments by NDC. The cumulative US$0.5 million receivable
owed by the NDC as of September 30, 1994 represented about 13 % (or 45 days) of the annual revenue
stream of the hydropower companies, constraining their ability to finance essential maintenance and
investment. Accounts payable, the only current liabilities of the hydropower companies, were below the
amount that the NDC owed to them.  Hydropower output is seasonal, with revenue collection
concentrated in the first half of the year, whereas costs are incurred more evenly over time. Thus there
is a risk of a revenue shortfall when costs continue to experience inflation that has not been adequately
reflected in prior months' rate-setting process. Minenergo was able to counter this problem in 1994
through monthly tariff adjustments that recovered the actual costs over whatever volume was produced
in a given month. For this reason, hydropower tariffs were subject to significant monthly fluctuations.
Compared to other sources of electricity, however, hydropower remained a low-cost source of power.

C. Future Financial Performance of the Implementing Agencies
3.11            Financial projections for Dniprohydroenergo and NDC for the period 1995-2001 have
been prepared and are presented in summary form in Tables 3.3-3.8, and in detail in Annex 6. The key
assumptions include:
*       the general rate of inflation in Ukraine will be 90%  in 1995, 34.5%  in 1996, 19.6%  in
1997, 12.7% in 1998, 6.2% in 1999, and 5% in 2000-2001;
*       the Krb/US$ exchange rate will be 140,000 in 1995, 165,000 in 1996, 180,142 in 1997,
191,253 in 1998, 199,766 in 1999, 205,842 in 2000 and 212,103 in 2001;
*       electricity demand will follow  the medium  scenario (see Annex  1) and electricity
generation will be according to the least cost plan (see Annex 3);
*       electricity produced by nuclear plants will be sold at a price of US$ 0.015/kWh (this is
expected to ensure the full recovery of operating costs, safety improvements, the
completion of ongoing investments, and financing of the decomissioning of the Chernobyl
plant);
*       following the completion of the proposed project, the hydropower plants will need to
generate local funds of US$ 8 million equivalent annually in the year 2000 and beyond,
in order to finance other investments;
*       in contrast to its current practice of purchasing only surplus thermal power supplies from
the regional companies, NDC (Energomarket) will purchase all output from the new
generating companies applying market-based (marginal-cost) pricing after mid-1995. The
average price of thermal power will be US$0.020/kWh in 1995, gradually increasing to
US$ 0.025 in 2000; and
*       NDC increases its working capital in 1995 through a modest increase in tariffs.

3.12              Based on these assumptions, in order to generate enough funds to cover the local costs
of the project, the projected price of hydroelectricity (approximately Krb 480/kWh in 1995) would have
to increase to Krb 935/kWh in 2000, equivalent to less than UScent 0. 1/kWh throughout the project
period, based on the forecast exchange rate for those years. The price of electricity sold by NDC has
already been increased from UScent 0.4/kWh in 1994 to UScent 1.52/kWh; for the year as a whole the
average price would have to be increased to UScent 1.91/kWh (most of this increase represents increases
in the costs of power, as well as a provision for bad debt, an increase in working capital, and the
financing needed for the local cost of investments). The average price of electricity sold by NDC is
projected to increase only 8% in dollar terms between 1995 and 2000. The project would lower the cost
of electricity production following its completion in the year 2000, thereby reducing retail electricity
prices in the long run.

3.13             Apart from water inflows, the financial performance of the Dniprohydroenergo is affected
by (i) the price it receives for electricity; and (ii) its collection ratio. Even after the reform of the power
industry is implemented, hydropower plants will be obliged to sell their output under long term contracts
at cost-based (below-market) tariffs. There is no substitute for the essential services such as frequency
control and peaking that these plants provide. In consideration of the service obligation that they bear,
Dniprohydroenergo would, under standard regulatory practice, receive a guaranteed rate of return. Due
to Ukraine's special problems with payment discipline, this guarantee should encompass provisions
ensuring timely payment. During negotiations, it was agreed that the contract between NDC and
Dniprohydroenergo would include the following (para. 6.1. b):
*       a cost-based tariff formula that (i) includes the regular adjustment of cost data to reflect
inflation; (ii) compensates for seasonal and annual fluctuations in hydropower output due
to external circumstances; (iii) ensures that sufficient funds are available to finance the
cost of agreed investments (including the proposed project); and (iv) encourages efficient
operation and maintenance of the hydropower plants; and
*       a guarantee of prompt payment within 20 days of billing, backed by an interest penalty
if delay occurs. The interest penalty will be calculated applying the National Bank
Refinancing Rate.
The signing of a suitable contract would be a condition of loan effectiveness (para. 6.2.b).
3.14             NDC's arrears to hydropower plants make up only 2.5%  of its current liabilities. Thus
the hydropower plants' current problems could be fully resolved in the near term without substantially
altering NDC's financial position. A one-time resolution of NDC's outstanding trade debt for hydropower
would be a condition of loan effectiveness (para. 6.2. c).



Financial and Economic Analysis                                                                         25
3.15            In the medium term, a more fundamental solution that addresses the underlying problem
of non-payments to NDC will be required, including appropriate provisions in NDC's resale contracts
as well as improvement of the regulatory and institutional framework within which NDC will operate.
An agreement was reached during negotiations that new contracts between NDC (Energomarket) and its
downstream purchasers would include the following terms (para. 6.1. c):
*       NDC will be entitled to charge an interest penalty on accounts receivable that become
past due (i.e., not paid within 20 calendar days of receiving the bill). This penalty will
be based on the National Bank Refinancing Rate. These penalties shall be immediately
due and payable at the time they are assessed, and shall be entitled to the same priority
of collection as any other account receivable; and
*      NDC will be entitled to make proportional reductions in deliveries to customers who have
not settled their accounts in full within 30 days of billing. Specifically, on the 20th day
after billing, NDC (Energomarket) will notify such customer that (i) his account is past
due and interest penalties have begun to accrue; and (ii) specify the portion of deliveries
that are liable to termination unless full payment (including accrued interest penalties) is
made. Proportional cutbacks will go into effect on the 10th day following the notice
(i.e., the 30th day after the original billing), and remain in effect until the customer's
past-due account, including interest penalties, is settled in full. Contracting parties will
agree that NDC (Energomarket) shall be held harmless for any damages, of whatever
type, resulting from a proportional cutback that has been carried out in accordance with
these stated conditions.
3.16            These provisions are expected to make it feasible for NDC to reduce both its accounts
receivable, and the delay when paying its suppliers. During negotiations, it was agreed that (i) ADC's
delay in paying its suppliers would be reduced to 45 days in 1995, 30 days in 1996, and 20 days
thereafter; and (ii) NDC's accounts receivable would not exceed 60 days in 1995, 40 days in 1996, 35
days in 1997, and 30 days thereafter (para. 6. 1.d).

3.17            Ukraine's financial and regulatory accounting standards currently do not provide for
explicit recognition of bad debt. During negotiations, the Bank and the delegation agreed that the price
setting mechanism would allow the National Dispatch Center to recover an allowance for bad debt in its
resale tariffs, currently estimated at 10%  of revenue in 1995, 7.5%  in 1996, 5%  in 1997-98, and 2.5%

thereafter (para. 6.1. e). A similar provision will not be needed in hydropower tariffs, as the contract
between the NDC and Dniprohydroenergo will provide for prompt payment in full.
3.18            In order to ensure adequate levels of self-financing of capital investments and a feasible
financing plan, an agreement was reached during negotiations that NDC and Dniprohydroenergo each
would generate for every financial year beginning in 1996 sufficient internal funds to cover not less than
40% of the annual average capital expenditures expected (or actually incurred) for that financial year,
the previous financial year, and the next financial year (para. 6.1 .ff   In order to ensure that
Dniprohydroenergo and NDC are capable of servicing their total borrowing requirements, it was agreed
during negotiations that Dniprohydroenergo and NDC would maintain a debt service coverage ratio of
at least 1.5 during the project period (para. 6.1.fl.
3.19            Profits for NDC are projected to be relatively uneven in the early years of project
implementation even though tariffs stay fairly constant in dollar terms. This is in part a reflection of the
forecast collection performance for 1995 (much of which will have transpired before loan effectiveness)
requiring slightly higher tariffs in order to maintain adequate cash flow. Part of the delayed payments
will become realized in 1996, significantly increasing the company's cash flow and allowing for a
permanent increase in working capital. Faster than expected reduction of NDC's accounts receivable in
1995 would allow for smoother profits and cash flows.

D. Financial Analysis of the Project
3.20            A financial analysis was carried out for the hydropower rehabilitation component in order
to determine whether it was in Dniprohydroenergo's financial interest to undertake the proposed
investments. The estimated after-tax Financial Intemal Rate of Return (FIRR) on incremental financial
cash flows -- defined as the difference between the "with" and "without" project situations and expressed
in current US dollars -- is 16 %. Details of the FIRR calculations, including the assumed electricity prices
and taxes, are provided in Annex 7. There was no financial analysis carried out for the system control
component, since the quantified benefits -- fuel savings derived from more efficient economic dispatch -
- do not accrue to the National Dispatch Center. Nevertheless, as described in Section C above, the
contracts between NDC and its downstream customers are expected to ensure the full recovery of the
investment costs of this component.

E. Economic Costs and Benefits
3.21          An economic evaluation, based on incremental costs and benefits, was performed for each
subcomponent and then aggregated for the two main components and the project as a whole. The
summary results are shown in Table 3.9. Details of the economic analysis are presented in Annex 8,
together with key assumptions. All costs are expressed in 1994 constant economic prices, net of taxes
and subsidies. The discount rate assumed for the economic analysis is 10%. The evaluation period is
1995-2020.

a/            Project total is less than the sum of the two main components due to the safety monitoring and technical assistance
components for which no benefits were quantified.
3.22          Hydropower Rehabilitation Component. The least cost investment analysis presented
in Annex 3 suggests that there is a lack of peaking capacity in Ukraine, and preserving the existing
peaking capacity is of high priority.  In order to analyze the economic viability of hydropower
rehabilitation in more detail, Net Present Values and Economic Internal Rates of Return (EIRR) were
calculated by comparing the economic cost and benefit streams of a "with project" and a "without
project" case. The "without project" case assumes continued operation of the units at a progressively
deteriorating level of efficiency and availability. The plant operating parameters for the two cases and
other assumptions are presented in Annex 8. The main quantified benefits are: (i) improvements in the
efficiency of turbines and generators; (ii) reduction in operating and maintenance costs as a result of
better instrumentation and plant control; and (iii) improvement in plant reliability and availability through
the reduction of forced and planned outages. As a result of improved efficiency and availability,
electricity production is estimated to increase (on average) by 567 GWh annually compared to the
scenario where no rehabilitation is undertaken, equivalent to 5.5 % of the average production of the plants
in 1991-93. Incremental electricity sales were valued at the estimated economic value of peak power
(which is 35 % higher than the average economic value of electricity). The plant-by-plant EIRRs range
from 11 % to 31 %, indicating that the proposed rehabilitation is economically viable for each plant (see
Table 3.10 below). The detailed plant-by-plant economic analysis is presented in Annex 8.
3.23          System Control Component. The benefits of this component derive mainly from greater
efficiency in the loading (automatic economic dispatch) of power units and improved power flow in the
system. As a result of the upgrade of communications, dispatch and system control, about 11,000 MW
of thermal capacity will become available for more efficient dispatching.  These benefits were
approximated by cost reduction resulting from fuel savings. Since the proposed upgrade measures
represent a significant advance over the present system, fuel savings are expected to be substantial. For
the purpose of this analysis, fossil fuel savings of 0.25 Mtoe/year were conservatively assumed
(equivalent to 3% of the expected fuel consumption of these plants in 1994). The EIRR for this
component was estimated at 22.7%.

3.24          Non-quantified Benefits.  The above-quantified benefits are regarded as a minimum
measure of the true economic benefits conferred by the project. Additional, non-quantified benefits of
the hydropower component include: (i) life extension of the plants (thereby deferring replacement); (ii)
improved environmental performance as a result of reduction in lubricating-oil leakage from old turbine
blade seals and reduced risk of flooding as the monitoring of dams improves; (iii) plant safety
improvements resulting from the upgraded instrumentation and control system; and (iv) consumer surplus
associated with incremental electricity sales. Non-quantified benefits from the system control component
include: (i) increased stability and security of the power system, which reduces unserved energy (due to
fewer blackouts and faster restoration of service); (ii) improved frequency control, which extends the
lifetime of rotary equipment connected to the network, and enhances the safety of nuclear plants (high
trequency fluctuation causes structural damage to rotating equipment, including safety-related equipment,
thus potentially compromising operational safety); and (iii) facilitation of Ukraine's future interconnection
with the neighboring power pools, opening the possibility for electricity exports.
F. Sensitivity Analysis
3.25          Calculations were carried out to analyse the sensitivity of the economic viability (proxied
by the EIRR) of the two main components and the entire project to (i) a 10% investment cost overrun
(for both components); (ii) a 10% decrease in the economic value of electricity produced (for the
hydropower component); (iii) a 10% decrease in the amount of fossil fuels saved (for the system control
component); and (iv) all of the above. Additionally, switching values (values at which the NPV is zero
and the EIRR is 10%) were calculated for investment costs (for both components), electricity price (for
the hydropower component), and fuel savings (for the system control component). The results are
presented in Table 3.11. Project economic returns are very robust relative to the indicated variations in
key project parameters. The switching value analysis suggests that project costs do not pose a significant
risk because both components remain economic even in the face of considerable overruns in investment
costs. The hydropower rehabilitation component remains economically viable even at 58% of the
assumed economic value of electricity. Due to the high base-case level of economic returns, the system
control component retains economic viability even when fuel savings amount to 41 % of the level assumed
for the base case.

IV. IMPLEMENTATION
A. Institutional Arrangements
4.1           Implementation of the project will be the responsibility of the beneficiaries, i.e., the
recently formed joint stock company Dniprohydroenergo and the National Dispatch Center (NDC). The
five hydropower plants under Dniprohydroenergo have maintained their role in day-to-day management,
however, all commercial functions such as financial management, accounting, contract negotiations, etc.
have been moved to the headquarters of the new corporation. In December 1994, Minenergo issued a
resolution for the consolidation of the regional dispatch centers under NDC by mid-1995. During
negotiations, it was agreed that the transfer of ownership of the regional dispatch centers to NDC would
be a condition of loan effectiveness (para. 6.2.d). The consolidation is not expected to result in major
changes (traditionally, NDC has been responsible for the operational control of the regional dispatch
centers). Although it is expected to remain a 100% state owned enterprise, the role of NDC will change
significantly when it becomes the commercial (as well as operational) center of the Ukrainian Power
System. As Energomarket, it will purchase pratically all electricity from the generators, and sell it to
the local electricity companies responsible for distribution and final sales to the consumers.
4.2           Dniprohydroenergo. In 1989, hydropower plants were taken out of the regional power
utilities, organized into six enterprises, and placed under the direct supervision of Minenergo. The six
enterprises formed a Hydropower Association. The Association was not a commercial entity, but a forum
through which certain activities were coordinated among the hydropower plants. It did not have its own
accounts, budget, nor (full time) employees. In early 1995, five out of the six enterprises were combined
into Dniprohydroenergo, a joint stock company that is 100% owned by the state. The following five
enterprises became part of Dniprohydroenergo (the number of employees in parenthesis): Mid-Dnieper
Cascade (1,168), Kremenchug (204), Dniproderzhinsk (323), Dnieper (292) and Kakhovka (120). The
Mid-Dnieper Cascade included the Kiev HPS, Kiev PSP and Kanev HPS, the Dnieper enterprise included
Dnieper I and Dnieper 1I HPS (the other three enterprises were named after their plants). The sixth
enterprise became a separate joint stock company by itself (Dnistrohydroenergo).
4.3           The hydropower plants have very similar organizational structures. The Chief Engineer,
Deputy Director for Capital Investments (in some cases only a Senior Engineer for Capital Investments),
Deputy Director for Support Services and Production, and the managers of the departments for economic
analysis, accounting, and personnel report directly to the Director. The Chief Engineer is in charge of
all technical activities related to the operation of the plant, and typically supervises production and
dispatch, technical and operational divisions, and turbine, hydroelectrical, and electrical shops. "Support
services and production" includes the procurement division, transport and security, and often involve
some activities not directly related to the main business operation, but to the provision of social services
(e.g., day-care centers) or other production activities (e.g., agricultural production).
4.4           Dniprohydroenergo not only centralized the commercial functions of the individual
hydropower enterprises, but also assumed certain new functions. One of them that is of particular
importance to the project, investment planning, has previously rested with Minenergo. Although the
Ministry retained a strategic planning function, Dniprohydroenergo is in the process of establishing an
independent planning capability. The individual hydro plants retained a significant part of their existing
organizational structure, at least for some time. However, most of their staff performing functions that
are to be carried out at the corporate level (financial management, accounting, procurement, investment
planning, etc.) are expected to be moved to the corporate headquarters.



Implementation                                                                        31
4.5          Hydropower investment projects in the past have been managed by Minenergo through
its Department for Capital Construction, and Ukrhydroproekt, an engineering organization which also
belonged to Minenergo's structure. Ukrhydroproekt, with 700 employees, has been in charge of all
engineering design work for the previous hydropower projects. It will have a similar role in this project
as well, serving as the main local engineering and project management consultant to Dniprohydroenergo
and its Project Implementation Unit, as well as to the Project Coordination Unit (see below).
4.6          The National Dispatch Center. NDC has about 430 employees, organized in 12
departments (number of employees in parenthesis): Dispatch (22), Optimization of Energy Regimes (15),
Optimization of Network Regimes (20), Relay Protection and Automation (19), Long-Term Planning (8),
SCADA and Communications (31), Computing Equipment (50), Economic Analysis (11), Billing and
Collection, Government Audit, Maintenance, and Support Services. After the consolidation of the
Regional Dispatch Centers under NDC, NDC will take over most of the employees from the existing
eight regional power utilities who work at the Regional Dispatch Centers. It is expected that the number
of people transferred will be under 100 per region.
4.7          The dispatch and system control component of the project includes the purchase and
installation of several types of equipment (turbine governors, data acquisition, communications,
computers, software). The existing engineering systems at the dispatch centers were developed and
designed in the central institutions of the FSU. Some of them are no longer present in Ukraine, which
has led to loss of information and engineering know-how. Although there are local engineering
organizations with expertise in most of the equipment categories, there is no organization which could
cover the entire range of issues, perform engineering work and provide counsel on integrated systems
in power system control. This role will be performed by an international consultant under the technical
assistance component of the project.
4.8          Project Coordination.  A Project Coordination Unit (PCU), headed by a Project
Coordinator appointed by Minenergo, will be in charge of overall project coordination. The PCU,
located in Minenergo, will coordinate project preparation activities, technical assistance, scheduling (to
the extent that it requires coordination between the hydropower rehabilitation and the system control
components), reporting, training, and other aspects of project implementation requiring coordination
between the two project implementation units (see para. 4.9). The Project Coordinator will report to
Minenergo, and serve as a liaison to the Ministry of Finance and the Bank for project activities. He will
establish project communication and documentation procedures, oversee preparation of bid documents,
arrange appointment of bid evaluation committees, coordinate bidding and contracting, arrange for audits
of project accounts, and organize training in project management, project financial operations and
procurement.
4.9          Project Implementation. Two Project Implementation Units (PIU) will be set up with
responsibilities to manage implementation of the hydropower rehabilitation (including dam safety) and
the system control components. The PIUs will be responsible for managing the engineering aspects of
project implementation (preparation of bid-level design specifications, supervision and approval of
manufacturers' detailed design, inspection in manufacturers' facilities, construction supervision, quality
control, system checkouts and integration in factory and on site, factory and field acceptance tests), as
well as scheduling, procurement (including bidding and contracting, in coordination with the PCU),
payments and disbursement operations related to the respective project components. The PIU of each
company (Dniprohydroenergo and NDC) will manage the respective Special Account. The managers of
the PIUs will have the authority to clear payments to suppliers and contractors, after authorization from
site managers (see para. 4.10). The PIUs will be integral parts of the implementing agencies and will



32                                                                         Implementation
consist of staff whose regular responsibilities include the implementation of investment projects. The
managers of the PIUs will be appointed by the Dniprohydroenergo and NDC, and will also have the title
of Deputy Project Coordinators of the PCU. The Deputy Project Coordinators will report to the Project
Coordinator and to the Director of the company that appointed them. During negotiations, it was agreed
that the Project Coordinator and the two Deputies would have qualifications acceptable to the Bank (para.
6. L.g). 7he establishment of the PCU and PIUs, and the appointment of the Project Coordinator and
Deputy Project Coordinators would be a condition of loan effectiveness (para. 6.2. e).
4.10         Site managers will be appointed at each site where project subcomponents are to be
implemented. The site managers, appointed by the managers of the respective facilities, will serve as
liaisons between management of the facilities and the corresponding PIUs. They will participate in
monthly review meetings with the PIUs, attended by concerned project staff, to review progress, address
implementation issues and authorize payments to suppliers and contractors. Site implementation will be
handled within the existing organizational structure of the concerned facilities.
4.11         Installation of equipment will be the responsibility of the respective facilities (hydro
plants, dispatch centers, thermal plants and substations), which will use their force account and
specialized local construction and installation companies, under the guidance of the supplier (to be
included in the tender documents), with additional assistance from the international consultants providing
TA for project implementation. The supplier will supervise the erection and provide the necessary
training, and will assume responsibility for the performance of the equipment. There is sufficient local
capability to perform the installation. Hydroelectromontazh, with 500 employees, which specializes in
erection and installation of electrical equipment, has been the main contractor for this type of work to all
Ukrainian hydroplants. Another company, Spetshydroenergomontazh, with 800 employees, specializes
in installation of turbines and generators. Both companies have gained international experience through
a number of projects in non-FSU countries. Equipment installed at the Dniester hydropower plant, the
thermal power plants and substations will be owned by the National Dispatch Center and leased to the
plants and the transmission company. The installation and maintenance of the equipment will be the
responsibility of the thermal plants and the tramsmission company.
4.12         Technical assistance (TA) activities for the project have been subdivided into the following
components: (i) engineering design; (ii) procurement; (iii) project management; and (iv) water
management study. International consultants will be hired to assist local consultants and the Project
Management and Implementation Units with all TA components. The TA activities will be coordinated
by the PCU, which will sign and manage TA contracts both with intemational and local consultants. The
first three TA activities (engineering design, procurement, and project management) have started in
January 1995, and for the first year (1995) will be financed by the Canadian Government and performed
by a Canadian consortium. During this year, emphasis will be on assisting Dniprohydroenergo and NDC
in preparation of tender documents (including engineering design specifications), bid evaluation, contract
negotiations, and with other procurement issues. The activities of the consultants during this stage will
also include assistance in organizing the project management and implementation units, project
administration, planning and scheduling. A substantial involvement of international consultants will be
needed also during the second year of project implementation (1996), in advising the two companies,
PCU and PlUs in various aspects of project management, administration and implementation (planning,
scheduling, engineering, construction management, inspection, testing, commissioning, project
documentation, reporting, cost accounting). International consultants will be needed throughout the entire
project implementation period, although their involvement is expected to be much reduced after the
second year. In case grant financing for TA activities after 1995 could not be secured, the foreign
component of TA would be financed from the Bank loan, and consultants chosen according to the Bank's



Implementation                                                                           33
Guidelines for Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency
(August 198 1).
4.13          The international consultants will work in conjunction with domestic consultants and the
staff of the companies assigned to the project. The international consultant providing TA for project
implementation will assign an Assistant Project Coordinator, reporting to the Project Coordinator, on a
full-time basis. The international consultant providing TA for procurement activities will assign a
Procurement Advisor, who is expected to be engaged full-time until the signing of the main contracts,
and will work on demand thereafter (about one third of the time). TA in project management,
supervision and quality control will be provided throughout the project.  Training sessions in
procurement, project management, financial management and quality control for project management and
implementation staff at PCU, PIUs and elsewhere (as needed) will be organized by international
consultants, in cooperation with the Project Coordinator, during the initial stages of project preparation
and implementation.
4.14          The technical assistance related to the management of the reservoirs on the Dnieper river
will be financed entirely by the Norwegian Government. This activity is expected to start by the end of
1995 and be completed in a two-year period. It will also involve both international and local consultants,
in which the international consultant(s) will take the lead. The recepient of this assistance will be
Dniprohydroenergo.
4.15          The technical assistance program (see Section I.E) supporting the implementation of
Decree 244/94 includes a number of institution building activities targeted at the beneficiaries of the
project. Dniprohydroenergo is receiving support for corporatization and development of organizational
structure, internal reporting, financial management, budgeting and planning. The establishment of
Energomarket on the basis of NDC is also supported, including the preparation of Energomarket
Members Agreement, bidding procedures, price formation software, dispatcher's manual and software,
and settlement procedures. Consultants are providing assistance for the preparation of contracts between
Energomarket and the nuclear and hydropower plants. A detailed study is scheduled to start in April that
will assess the metering and commnunications requirements for the operation of the "pool". These
technical assistance activities are financed by grants provided by the United Kingdom, United States,
Netherlands, Switzerland, and other donors.
B. Implementation Schedule
4.16          According to the Implementation Plan (see Annexes 9-13), the project will be
implemented over a period of 5 years and is expected to be completed by June 30, 2000. The
rehabilitation of turbines is on the critical path of the implementation of the hydropower rehabilitation
component. Installation of switchyard equipment, control and monitoring equipment and dam safety
systems, as well as system control and monitoring components, is expected to proceed without difficulties
since it involves work at existing sites. Consulting services under the technical assistance component
have started in January 1995, so that project implementation can proceed expeditiously after the loan
approval. A detailed implementation schedule is presented in Annex 9.
C. Procurement
4.17          The procurement for the project will consist of 11 packages for equipment and goods,
ranging from US$0.8 million to US$32.1 million with total aggregate value of US$91.4 million, and 2
packages for technical assistance activities, estimated at US$0.3 million and US$1.5 million, respectively.



34                                                                         Implementation
A list of procurement packages is provided in Annex 10. All equipment and goods financed from the
Bank Loan will be procured according to the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loan and
IDA Credits (1992). Contracts for equipment and goods estimated to cost more than US$300,000 will
be procured through International Competitive Bidding (ICB) using Bank's Standard Bidding Documents.
Domestic manufacturers competing under ICB will be eligible for a 15% preference, or the prevailing
custom duty applicable to non-exempt importers (whichever is less) in bid evaluation, provided that they
can prove that value added to the product in Ukraine equals to at least 20% of the ex-factory price of the
bid. The preference shall be applied in accordance with the provisions contained in Appendix 2 of the
Guidelines. Small contracts for goods, US$300,000 equivalent or below, with an aggregate limit of
US$1.5 million, may be procured through international shopping, after obtaining a minimum of three
price quotations from at least three eligible countries. Direct contracting up to an aggregate amount of
US$1.0 million may also be allowed, if the procedure is justified (e.g., for items of proprietary nature
or items required to ensure compatibility with the already installed equipment, for spare parts available
only from the original supplier, etc.). Total amount of goods purchased through international shopping
and direct contracting will not exceed US$2.5 million (less than 3% of the Bank Loan available for
equipment and goods). List of goods to be purchased under these two procedures will be subject to prior
review by the Bank. Consultants, to be employed under the technical assistance component of the loan
if bilateral funds are not available, will be selected according to the Bank's Guidelines for Use of
Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency (August 1981).
Project elements, their estimated cost, and proposed methods of procurement are summarized in Table
4.1.
4.18         Project implementing agencies in Ukraine have very limited knowledge of international
commercial practices and the Bank's procurement procedures. Procurement teams will be established
within the Project Implementation Units, and will receive training during the early stages of project
implementation, both from the Bank and from the consultants engaged under the technical assistance
component. To ensure compliance with the Bank guidelines, the following documents will be subject to
prior review by the Bank: draft tender documents, bid evaluation reports and recommendations for awards
of contracts, for all ICB procurement (US$300,000 and above) and all Bank-financed contracts awarded
under direct contracting/negotiation (covering about 98% of the total value of Bank-financed equipment
and goods); list of goods to be purchased through international shopping financed by the Bank; terms of
reference for all consulting contracts; all consulting contracts financed by the Bank above US$100,000
for firms, and above US$50,000 for individual consultants. All other contracts will be subject to ex-post
review.
4.19         The rehabilitation of turbines, stator and rotor windings and magnetic stator core for
generators are expected to be financed from local sources and procured by direct contracting with
domestic suppliers, Turboatom and Elektrotyazhmash. The Turboatom factory, producing turbines, has
about 10,000 employees, of which 2,500 have university degree. It has delivered turbines to more than
160 plants in 26 countries. The generator factory, Elektrotyazhmash has about 8,600 employees, of
which 2,140 are engineers. It has a long list of reference plants in more than 30 countries. The contracts
will contain sufficient guarantees for timely delivery of the contracted equipment and services,
performance, provisions for inspections and tests, pricing and warranties. The equipment under these
contracts, although not financed by the Bank, is critical for the overall project implementation and
operational performance. It was agreed during negotiations that Dniprohydroenergo would sign suitable
contracts, satisfactory to the Bank, with the turbine and generator manufacturers by November 30, 1995
(para. 6.1.h).

4.20           A General Procurement Notice was published in the Development Business Forum on
Nov. 16, 1994, allowing for more than the required 60 days prior to the issue of the bidding documents.
The General Procurement Notice will be updated and published annually. At least 45 days prior to the
issuance of bidding documents, individual bidding opportunities will be advertised in a major local
newspaper.  The project agencies would also be expected to advise known eligible and qualified
traditional suppliers.
4.21           Procurement information will be collected by the PCU and reported to the Bank as
follows:
(a)    prompt reporting of contract award information;
(b)    semiannual and annual reports that include (see also para. 4.29):
*      revised cost estimates for individual contracts and the total project, including best
estimates of allowances for physical and price contingency;
*      revised timing of procurement actions, including advertising, bidding, contract
award, and completion time for individual contracts; and
*      compliance with aggregate limits on specified methods of procurement.

4.22          The Government is expected to prepare legislation instituting public procurement rules
and regulations as part of the program to transform the economy from a centrally planned to a narket-
oriented system based on the development of a competitive private sector. The Country Procurement
Assessment Report is expected to be prepared after legislation has been enacted and placed in effect.
D. Disbursement
4.23          The proceeds of the loan will be disbursed over five and a half years (1995-2000) on the
following basis:
(a)    100% of the foreign costs of imported equipment and goods;
(b)    100% of local ex-factory costs of supply of equipment and goods and 80% of local
expenditures for other items procured locally; and
(c)    100% of expenditures for consultancy services.
4.24          Table 4.2 shows the estimated disbursement profile for the project, as derived from the
implementation plan of the project components (Annexes 5 and 9); a more detailed disbursement schedule
is presented in Annlex I 1. The disbursement profile follows broadly the standard disbursement profile
for energy projects in the Europe and Central Asia Region. The Closing Date for the proposed loan
would be December 31, 2000.

4.25          Disbursement for goods under contracts not exceeding US$300,000 equivalent, consulting
firms under contracts not exceeding US$ 100,000 equivalent, and individual consultants not exceeding
US$ 50,000 equivalent would be made against statement of expenditures (SOE) in order to assist the
borrower in making timely payments. The supporting documentation for these contracts would not be
sent to the Bank, but would be retained by the borrower for inspection by supervision missions and by
external auditors.  All other disbursements would be fully documented.  The minimum  size of
applications for direct payments will be US$50,000.
4.26          To facilitate project implementation, the Borrower would establish two Special Accounts
(one for the Dniprohydroenergo, the other for NDC) in commercial bank(s) on terms and conditions
satisfactory to the Bank to cover the Bank's share of expenditures. The authorized allocation to the
Dniprohydroenergo's Special Account would be US$2.0 million, and to the NDC's Special Account
US$2.0 million, representing about four months of average expenditures effected through the Special
Accounts. At the request of the Borrower and, based on project needs, the Bank would make initial
deposits into the Special Accounts up to the amount of the authorized allocation. Applications for the



Implementation                                                                           37
replenishment of the Special Accounts would be submitted monthly or when one-third of the amount has
been withdrawn, whichever occurs earlier. Documentation requirements for replenishment would follow
the usual Bank procedures. In addition, monthly bank statements of the Special Accounts which have
been reconciled by the Borrower would accompany all replenishment applications. During negotiations,
agreement was reached on the arrangements for establishmett, operation and auditing of the Special
Accounts (para. 6.1.i).
E. Accounts and Audits
4.27          Ukraine's electricity enterprises follow standard Soviet accounting procedures, which have
been augmented as required by the administrative reporting requirements of the many government bodies
to which they report. The financial accounting standard now in use is not adequate for providing reliable
management and regulatory reports. Revenues are reported on a cash basis, when received, and costs
associated with producing revenue are not booked until such time as revenues arrive. When accounts
receivable are not being collected, a substantial portion of costs are held off the books, misstating inconme.
A related problem is that neither of the beneficiaries is equipped to track its receivables and payables on
a dated basis, and thus there is no basis for calculating and recognizing inflationary losses. At present,
there is no recognition of uncollectible debt. In addition to maintaining the statutory accounts required
by Ukrainian law, the beneficiaries will maintain a parallel system of financial statements (income
statements, sources and uses of funds, and balance sheets) that meet international accounting standards
(IAS). The IAS accounts will supply data inputs suitable for use in tariff calculations and regulatory
reporting that will be required by the National Energy Regulatory Commission. They also will serve as
the basis for calculating interest penalties to be provided for under their new contracts, and for monitoring
progress in improving the timeliness of payments and collections. Financial statemnents will be audited
by an auditor acceptable to the Bank and the audit reports submitted to the Bank within six tmonths of the
end of each financial year (para. 6.1.j).
4.28          The accounting for all Special Account transactions and for all other project-related
accounts will be maintained in accordance with international accounting standards. Annual financial
statements of IBRD-financed components will be prepared and audited in accordance with International
Auditing Guidelines by suitably qualified independent auditors acceptable to IBRD, and submitted to
IBRD within six months of the close of the GOU fiscal year. Audits will also be carried out, at the same
time, and for corresponding periods in accordance with the Bank guidelines, for SOEs against which
disbursements have been made or are due to be made out of the credit proceeds, and specific reference
to the Special Account (SA) and SOEs will be made in the audit reports accompanying the financial
statements. During negotiations, agreement was reached that the implementing agencies would submit
to the Bank the audit reports and auditedfinancial statements for the Special Account, project accounts
and SOEs for the every fiscal year, not later than six months after the close of such year. Agreement was
also reached that auditors acceptable to the Bank would be retained to review the accounting systems and
supporting internal procedures and practices for the Special and project Accounts and SOEs, and
recommend any needed changes (para. 6.1. i).
F. Monitoring and Evaluation
4.29          The Project Coordination Unit will prepare semiannual and annual project progress
reports. The progress reports, following clearance by the Borrower, will be submitted to the Bank. The
progress reports will include, but not necessarily be limited to, project physical progress, procurement,
disbursements, project costs, schedule, plan for next reporting period, the work of consultants, and
project administrative aspects. The progress reports will be sent to the Bank within four weeks after



38                                                                                 Implementation
conclusion of the reporting period.  The first progress report will be sent three months after loan
effectiveness.
4.30           The Borrower will submit a mid-term progress report, covering all components of the
project, no later than June 30, 1997. In addition to the topics covered by the semiannual reports, the
mid-term report will include an assessment of the status of loan covenants, overall institutional
performance of the companies-beneficiaries, and evaluation of the project based on a set of performance
indicators (Annex 12). This report will be reviewed with the Bank by no later than September 30, 1997,
and, based on the recommendations of the report and the Bank's views on the matter, measures will be
taken to ensure the efficient completion of the project. The timing of the mid-term review and the
performance indicators were agreed at negotiations (paras. 6.1.k, 6.1.1).
4.31           A project implementation completion report (ICR) will be submitted to the Bank promptly
after the completion of the project, but no later than 6 months after the Loan Closing Date. The ICR will
discuss execution of the project, its costs and benefits, the performance of the borrower, the World Bank
and other agencies involved, and lessons learned. The ICR will also contain evaluation of the project
performance indicators.
4.32           In addition to the review  of procurement actions, semi-annual reports and other
documentation, a number of supervision missions is planned.  The project is expected to require
supervision from the Bank at an average of 25 staff-weeks per year during the first two years of
implementation, and 15 staff-weeks per year thereafter (Annex 13).
G. Operation
4.33           Following project completion, the life of the hydropower plants will be extended by about
20 years. The operation of the rehabilitated plants is not expected to pose a technical challenge for the
well-educated, experienced staff working at the plants. The hydropower plants will continue to be the
lowest cost electricity generators in Ukraine, ensuring the long term financial viability of
Dniprohydroenergo. NDC, as the future Energomarket, will play a key role not only technically, but
also financially in the reformed power industry. NDC will operate the wholesale (spot) market for
(practically) all electricity generated in Ukraine, and recover its costs by adding a margin ("uplift") to
the price of electricity it sells to local electricity distributors/suppliers. The facilities installed by the
project will be essential for the successful functioning of the wholesale market, including daily bidding,
dispatching, metering, verification, and settlements.  Under the project, technical training will be
provided to NDC staff in the operation and maintenance of the modernized communications, system
control and dispatch facilities. A large donor funded institutional building effort that has been mobilized
in support of the power industry reform will provide the necessary training for NDC's commercial
functions. Suppliers will provide training the necessary training for the maintenance of the equipment
they supply and guarantee delivery of spare parts, both for Dniprohydroenergo and NDC. The operation
plans of Dniprohydroenergo and NDC were agreed at negotiations (para. 6.1. m).



Project Risks and Benefits                                                               39
V. PROJECT RISKS AND BENEFITS
5.1           Project Risks. The main risks for the project is the possibility that the Government
would be unwilling to (i) adhere to the agreed pricing formula for the electricity produced by the
hydropower plants; and (ii) implement a strict regulatory policy to prevent the further accumulation of
payment arrears. These could seriously undermine the financial position of the Dniprohydroenergo and
NDC, and thereby endanger the implementation of the project. The reform of the power industry based
on Decree 244/94 is expected to decrease these risks, but cannot eliminate them. The implementation
of the reform itself is subject to political risks. Risks arising from the pricing of electricity have been
addressed under the project by requiring the adoption of a tariff formula that includes all operating costs,
recovers investment costs, and allows for regular adjustment to reflect inflation. Risks arising from non-
payment by NDC's customers (i.e., local electricity companies and large industrial plants) have been
addressed by requiring appropriate contractual arrangements, including the reduction/termination of
service in the case of non-payment. The beneficiaries' inexperience in implementation of Bank projects
poses additional risks. Inferior performance of domestic equipment and domestic supply constraints could
also delay project execution and affect the quality of work. These risks have been addressed through the
careful planning of activities that are on the critical path, and by providing technical assistance to the
PIUs in procurement, supervision and quality control. Economic returns are very robust relative to
variations in key project parameters. A switching value analysis suggests that project costs do not pose
a significant risk because both major components remain economic even in the face of considerable
overruns in investment costs. The hydropower rehabilitation component remains economically viable
even at half of the assumed economic value of electricity. The system control component retains
economic viability even when fuel savings amount to one-third of the level assumed for the base case.
5.2           Benefits. The main benefits are improvements in the efficiency and availability of
hydropower plants, and the increased efficiency in the loading of hydro- and thermal power generation
units. Additional benefits are: (i) the increased security of the power system that will lead to fewer
blackouts; (ii) the improved stability of frequency that will enhance nuclear safety; (iii) the better
environmental performance of the hydropower plants that will reduce the pollution of rivers; and (iv) the
improved monitoring of dams and reservoirs that will reduce the risk of dam breaks.

UKRAINE
HYDROPOWER REHABILTIATION AND SYSTEM CONTROL PROJECT
ELECTRICITY DEMAND FORECAST
1.            Due to the large uncertainty surrounding the course of future economic changes in
Ukraine, alternative electricity demand projections were prepared by the Bank. Scenario A assumes a
comprehensive and radical reform process, including raising electricity tariffs to economic levels in the
near future and the strict enforcement of hard budget constraints for enterprises. By contrast, Scenario
B reflects very slow-paced reforms and restructuring, meaning that the completion of price adjustment
is much deferred and enterprise budget constraints remain soft. Importantly, the pressure on enterprises
to restructure towards a less electricity-intensive product mix and to use electricity more efficiently is
much weaker in Scenario B than in Scenario A. Scenario C tracks a middle course between these two
extreme outcomes by portraying a gradual, steady progress towards a market-based economy.
2.            Macroeconomic performance. In Scenario A, GDP recovers from the current slump
in 1996, and the economy is set to grow at relatively high rates (an average 5.5% per year over the 1996-
2010 period). In Scenario B, GDP continues to contract longer, the recovery is weak and the post-
recovery (1998-2010) growth rate, at about 3.5%, is lower. Scenario C is an intermediate case, with
an average growth rate of 4.5% per year in the post-recovery period of 1997-2010.
3.            Structural shifts in total output.  Ukrainian enterprises must make changes in their
product mix under any reform scenario. These shifts are assumed to benefit the less electricity-intensive
consumer industries, high technology manufacturing and services at the expense of the presently oversized
heavy industries. The structural transformation proceeds at various speeds in the three scenarios, the
fastest being in Scenario A and the slowest in Scenario B.
4.            Electricity price adjustment. In Scenario A, industrial electricity tariffs rise to the
economic level by the end of 1995, and the presently cross-subsidized tariffs (for households, communal
services, agriculture, etc.) reach the industrial level by the end of 1997.  The shift to economic cost
levels happens more gradually in the other scenarios.
5.            Price responsiveness. Consumer sensitivity to changes in electricity prices corresponds
to that of a reformed semi-market economy proxied by Hungary. Under Scenario A, the assumed short-
and long-run elasticities are -0.08 and -0.16, respectively. In Scenarios B and C, which reflect a weaker
sensitivity to costs, price elasticity is set at half of the above values.
6.            Methodology. For the purpose of the quantitative projection, a dynamic consumption
model was used (described in detail in the Ukraine Energy Sector Review, Report No. 11646-UA)
7.            Projections. The forecasts to the year 2010 are shown in Table 1 and Figure I (the
figures refer to gross consumption, i.e., they include station use and network losses; in recent years gross
consumption exceeded final, or net, consumption by about 20%). The recently experienced decline in



ANNEX 1
Page 2
gross consumption (27% in the past four years) is projected to continue in the near future in all cases.
In Scenario A (High Case), the early economic recovery offsets a large part of the severe price shock
imposed on the industrial users, resulting in a relatively small decrease in consumption until 1997.
During the period 1998-2010, demand recovers at a rate of 3.4% per year, reaching the pre-crisis (1990)
reference level only towards the end of the forecast period. In Scenario B (Low Case), demand levels
out in 2000 at 64% of the reference level, followed by a slow recovery thereafter. Under Scenario C
(Medium Case), after bottoming out in 1997-98, demand growth resumes at 3% per year, but the 1990
consumption level is not reached even in 2010.

8.           Official Ukrainian demand forecast. The latest (May 1994) forecast prepared by

under two alternatives. The low forecast differs from the high one on the assumption of efficiency gains
derived from the adoption of vigorous electricity conservation measures (in TWh):

High forecast           227.2      228.1      256.0      278.0      295.0
The difference between the official and Bank forecasts is sizeable, although it narrows towards the end
of the projection horizon. The discrepancy is especially large for the medium term, largely because the
official forecast does not assume any drop in power usage for 1994 (the Bank projects a 14% decline)
and for the subsequent years. For 2005 and 2010, the Bank's High and Medium forecasts are
comparable with the conservation-centric official forecasts.

HYDROPOWER REHABILITATION AND SYSTEM CONTROL PROJECT
NUCLEAR SAFETY
1.           Nuclear power in Ukraine currently provides almost 40% of electricity generation and
represents 26% of installed capacity.  The 14 Soviet-designed operating units include 10 pressurised
water reactors of the VVER-1000 type, two older 440 MW units of the VVER 213 type, and two graphite
water reactors of RBMK-1000 type at Chernobyl. Four more VVER-1000 reactors are in an advanced
stage of construction at the Zaporozhye, Rovno, Khmelnitsky and South-Ukraine plants.
2.            The safety of nuclear reactors in Ukraine has been a major concern for the international
community. Especially serious doubts remain amongst international nuclear safety experts about the
safety of the RBMK reactors at Chernobyl (which account for 5% of total electricity generation).
Chernobyl Unit 4 was destroyed in April 1986 and is enclosed in a deteriorating concrete shelter
(sarcophagus).  Unit 2 has been shut down since the October 1991 fire in its turbine-generator block.
A safety review conducted by the International Atomic Energy Agency in March 1994 found numerous
safety deficiencies in the two units which remain operational. Of particular concern are specific problems
in the design of the first generation Unit 1. These deficiencies include an insufficient emergency reactor
cooling system and vulnerability to serious failures, particularly from fires, as a result of poor diversity
and separation of electrical cables and equipment in the reactor control and protection systems. Unit 3
is a second generation RBMK reactor having significant safety improvements. However, it is in an
increased radiation environment emanating from the neighboring destroyed Unit 4. Although planned,
there is currently lack of safety-upgrading activities at Chernobyl.  Only limited safety-enhancing
measures were undertaken due to the original 1991 decision to terminate operations by the end of 1993.
In addition to these shortcomings at Chernobyl, most of Ukraine's nuclear plants suffer from inadequate
instrumentation and control and weaknesses in management and training. In 1994, the lack of financing
severely constrained the ability of Goskomatom (the nuclear operator) to carry out maintenance and to
undertake work to improve safety, including the procurement of up-to-date equipment and spare parts.
The loss of highly skilled personnel who moved to Russia because of higher compensation also had a
negative effect on safety. The price of electricity sold by the nuclear plants was substantially increased
in early 1995, alleviating somewhat the financing constraints.
3.           In response to mounting domestic and international safety concerns following the fire in
Unit 2, Parliament mandated that the Chernobyl plant should be closed by the end of 1993 and imposed
a moratorium on the completion of new nuclear units under construction. In November 1993, as a
consequence of the deterioration in the country's energy supply, Parliament revoked the order and
allowed continued operation as long as "technically feasible". Also, in February 1994 a presidential
decree was issued approving the recommissioning of Unit 2 in 1995.  According to current plans,
Goskomatom will decommission Chernobyl Units 1-3 when their reactor channels are exhausted, i.e, in
the 1997-2005 period.  The Government's plan also includes the completion of Zaporozhye 6,
Khmelnitsky 2 and Rovno 4 in 1995-1999 (the completion of South Ukraine 4 is hampered by the lack
of cooling water). The implementation of a program of measures to upgrade the safety of all operating
nuclear units is scheduled to start in 1995-96. And, as a matter of urgency, the construction of a new,

structurally safe sarchophagus is planned for the destroyed Unit 4 at Chemobyl.
4.            The Ukrainian authorities indicated that they were prepared to consider and discuss
possible early closure of the Chernobyl plant, provided that a satisfactory solution was identified, in
particular, for financing replacement nuclear capacity, closure costs, including the mitigation of the social
costs of closure. In the dialogue with the G-7 Nuclear Safety Working Group, Ukraine suggested that
an international task force be formed from Ukrainian and foreign experts, including representatives of
the relevant international financial institutions, with the task of preparing a comprehensive nuclear safety
Action Plan in the context of a power sector development strategy.
5.           The G-7 Sunmmit Meeting, held at Naples in July 1994, called for the closure of the
Chernobyl plant as an "urgent priority". The meeting outlined a broad sectoral Action Plan for the
closure of Chernobyl, including the early completion of three nuclear reactors (Zaporozhye 6, Rovno 4
and Khmelnitsky 2) to adequate safety standards, comprehensive energy sector reformns, rehabilitation of
conventional power plants, increased energy conservation, and the use of alternative energy sources. The
G-7 offered to provide an "initial" amount of US$200 million in grants, in addition to the contribution
offered by the European Union (US$120 million in TACIS grants and US$480 million in long-term loans
from EURATOM). Support from the international financial institutions and other donors was also called
for.
7.           The dialogue between the Ukrainian authorities and the G-7 continues, notwithstanding
initial Ukrainian reservations about the inadequacy of the financial package offered at Naples. The joint
international task force was formed in December 1994 with a mandate to develop a detailed,
comprehensive Action Plan for nuclear safety, and its work is underway.

HYDROPOWER REHABILITATION AND SYSTEM CONTROL PROJECT
LEAST COST POWER INVESTMENT PROGRAM
A. Methodology
1.    A least-cost analysis of the Ukrainian power system (UPS) expansion alternatives for the period
1995-2010 has been performed to assess future investment requirements of the system, and the type and
timing of new capacity additions needed. The main objective of the analysis was to investigate the need
for peaking units in the system, in order to assess the relative importance of the hydropower capacity as
the only peaking capacity present in the existing capacity mix. The analysis was carried out using the
WASP computer program'. The general methodology imbedded in WASP is focussed on finding the
least cost power system expansion plan that matches projected electricity demand while maintaining the
reliability of the system operation at a prescribed level. The model takes into account both maintenance
requirements and the operational reliability of generating units. The system costs include investment
costs, financing costs during construction, fuel costs, operation and maintenance costs, and costs of
energy not served.
B. Description of the Existing System
2.    The installed electricity generation
capacity of the UPS was 52,122 MW in
1993. It included 12,818 MW of nuclear
capacity, located in 5 plants with a total           Figure 1.1 Capacity Mix
of 14 units in operation.  There were
more than 40 thermal (fossil fuel) power                 4       >
plants with conventional steam  cycle
technology, with over 110 generating                          X                     ch_   l
units and a total capacity of 32,364 MW,                                          FN
of which 3,824 MW were combined heat-
and-power units.  Hydro capacity was                          .                   U3I.dbi
4,700 MW, stationed mostly in 9 plants                     a
with a total of 100 generating units. The
capacity of industrial power plants was
about 2,240 MW. The total effective
generating capacity of the system was about 50,000 MW, due to the derating of older plants. Most older
fossil fuel plants (about 23,000 MW) used coal as their primary fuel, but needed gas or mazut for co-

firing. About 5,520 MW of power generation as well as most of the combined heat-and-power plants
run on gas or mazut as main fuels. Figure III.1 shows the capacity mix of the existing system.
3.    Electricity generation in 1993 was
228,316 GWh, of which thermal plants
produced 135,875 GWh, nuclear plants

-. l l   El  5 Ndww  GWh (Fig. 111.2). Net export was 1,145
GWh (2708 GWh exports, 1,563 GWh
imports).  Self-consumption of thermal
lInduirtal  and hydro plants was 10,648 GWh, and
*0%  Il3a H*of nuclear plants 5,228 GWh.  After
60%                                 accounting for other production needs
(615 GWh), consumption of the pump
storage  plant  (302  GWh),  and
transmission  and  distribution  losses
(22,473   GWh),  final  electricity
consumption came to 187,905 GWh. The peak demand in 1993 occurred in January, at 37,000 MW:
the minimum demand, in June, was about 17,000 MW. Heat production was about 48 million Gcal.
Total fuel consumption for electricity and heat production was 53 million tons of coal equivalent (tce,
defined as 7000 Kcal/kg), consisting of 19.4 million tce of natural gas, 7.3 million tce of mazut, and 26.3
million tce of coal (Figure III.3).
4.    Electricity generation, domestic consumption and exports have declined significantly in recent
years. Between 1990 and 1993, generation decreased by about 23 %, domestic consumption by 15 %, and
net exports by 96% (the decline is likely to continue for some time -- see Annex 1). GDP, however,
declined even more (37% in the same period), and the electricity intensity of GDP increased from about
1.95 kWh/US$ in 1990 (about 3.4 times the OECD) to 2.32 kWh/US$ in 1993.
C. Main Assumptions
5.    The main assumptions of the analysis concern system demand, unit retirement schedule,
commitments to rehabilitation of existing and addition of new units, fuel mix, electricity imports,
composition and characteristics of new generating units proposed for the system expansion, and various
cost components and parameters.
6.    Electricity Demand. Electricity demand scenarios were prepared by the World Bank (see Annex
1). To reflect the declining share of industrial consumption of electricity, the yearly load factors2 are
assumed to decline gradually from the present level of about 0.73 to 0.65 by year 2010, remaining at that
level through the rest of the planning period. The maximum yearly loads were derived from the energy
projections (Annex 1) and the load factors assumption. In addition to satisfying the peak loads, the
system has to have 15% reserve in capacity (the standard planning requirement for the UPS). Exports
2/    The load factor for a given period is defined as ratio of average load versus peak load in that period.

were not considered in the simulations performed3.
7.     The system load is modeled by four load duration curves4: winter, spring, summer and fall. For
illustration, Figure 111.4 shows daily load profiles for winter and summer working days and Sundays for
the period July 1, 1992 - June 30, 1993. Figure III.5 exhibits yearly maximum and minimum monthly
loads for the same period.
8.     Firm  Commitments5. The only unit assumed to be firmly committed was a 225 MW  unit at
Dobrotvorsk, currently under construction, and the nuclear units, as described in para. 10 below.
9.     Retirement Schedule. The following retirement schedule was provided by Minenergo. (Note:
lxlOO in 1996 means that 1 unit of 100 MW is retired in year 1996.)

Net exports of electricity declined dramatically in the last four years, from 27,970 GWh in 1990 (9.4%
of total generation) to 1146 GWh in 1993 (0.5% of total generation). Demand is falling in most of the
traditional Ukrainian electricity export markets. Also, most of the UPS now operates in an island mode.
It is, therefore, difficult to project levels of electricity exports for future years. Given the relatively limited
objectives of this exercise, exports were not included in the analysis.
4/     A load duration curve for a given time period represents duration of time for which the system load is
greater than a given load level.
5f     The WASP model handles units commnitted to future additions (these units, together with the existing units
comprise what is in WASP terminology termed as "fixed" system) in a different manner than the candidate
units, i.e., its investment costs are not part of the objective function being minimized in the optimization
process, for obvious reasons (since they are committed, they are not part of the WASP's decision
procedure). The term "candidate units" refers to units that are considered as candidates for system
expansion.

10.    Nuclear program.  For the nuclear program, the following scenario has been adopted:
Zaporozhye 6, Khmelnitsky 2, and Rovno 4 completed in 1995-1999, and Chernobyl 3 recommissioned
in 1996. It was also assumed that Chernobyl units 1, 2 and 3, with 1000 MW capacity each, would be
retired in the 1997-2005 period. One thousand MW of nuclear capacity was assumed to be unavailable
throughout the planning period due to safety upgrades of the nuclear plants.
11.    Candidate Units. The following units were considered as candidates for the system expansion
(the first number in parentheses represents construction costs, with interest during construction included,
in US$ million; the second number represents duration of construction, in years): 120 MW single cycle
gas turbine (357, 3), 450 MW combined cycle gas turbines (770, 4), 500 MW pulverized coal unit (1500,
5), and 500 MW mazut steam unit (1135, 4). Also, pump storage units of 324 MW in generating and
408 MW in pumping regime, with cycle efficiency of 0.7 and yearly generation of 492 GWh, were
considered in order to model the Dniester pump storage plant (PSP) as a candidate. The remaining
investment costs for the Dniester PSP, taking into account that about 70% of civil works and 20% of
equipment was completed, were estimated at 227$/kW (of generating power), i.e., the cost of total
completion was estimated at US$ 514.8 million (in 1994 US$).

12.    Fuel Prices. The price of natural gas was assumed to escalate from $55/tcm in 1994 to $80/tcm
in 2010, in real terms (in 1994 US$) with uniform growth rate over the period. The price of mazut was
increased from $60/ton in 1994 to $75/ton in 2010, and the price of coal from $15/ton to $20/ton in year
2000, remaining at that level thereafter. Calorific values of the fuels were assumed at 8.1 Gcal/tcm (gas),
9.7 Gcal/ton (mazut), and 5 Gcal/ton (coal). The price of nuclear fuel was assumed at $ 5.2 per MWh
electricity produced.
13.    Other assumptions.  Given the current low level of maintenance activities and the need to
improve maintenance, the operating and maintenance costs were assumed to rise from their current levels

Page 5
by 10% annually in real terms until 2000, and at 5% thereafter. The discount rate, used both for
levelizing all costs and for the calculation of interest during construction, was 10%.
D. Results
14.    Three cases were evaluated using the medium load forecast, with the four nuclear units firnly
committed and commissioned according to the schedule described in para. 10. The base case (Case 1)
assumed completion of seven units at the Dniester PSP in 1998, 1999, 2001, 2002, 2004, 2005 and 2006,
respectively. In Case 2, the optimal timing of completing the Dniester PSP units was determined by the
progran, rather than being pre-determined. Case 3, designed to test the contribution of the Dniester PSP,
assumed that no units at the Dniester PSP would be completed during the planning period.
15.    Total levelized system costs (for 1993 as the base year) for the medium demand cases (Cases 1,
2 and 3) are US$ 17,847 million, US$ 17,691 million and US$ 17,751 million, respectively. The
associated total investment costs for the planning period, in constant 1994 US$ million (i.e., not
levelized), assuming level 3 safety upgrades for the nuclear units6, were 4093, 4093 and 5311,
respectively, of which costs of completing the four nuclear units were 1935.7 No new capacity additions
(in addition to the firmly comnmitted 225 MW thermal capacity and 4000 MW nuclear capacity as
described above are needed until 2008. The best solution (Case 2) is to commission all 7 units of the
Dniester PSP; in addition, 6 gas turbine units (5 in 2009, 1 in 2010) and four combined-cycle units (all
in 2010) are added. If the Dniester PSP is excluded (Case 3), the number of combined cycle units in the
optimal solution increases to 9, while the number of gas turbine units remains 6. The presence of rather
inefficient, but less capital intensive gas turbine units in the optimal solution shows that the system needs
additional peaking capacity.
16.    Although software constraints8 make the direct evaluation of the proposed project difficult, the
results of the least-cost analysis suggest that rehabilitation of the existing hydro plants is consistent with
the need to preserve and enhance regulating capacity. A similar conclusion should hold for the low-cost
rehabilitation of thermal plants that would increase their load-following capabilities and efficiency. At
the same time, the presence of the capacity surplus throughout an extended period (until 2008 for the
medium demand forecast) merits a closer examination of the retirement program. The retirement of
additional units that are inefficient, expensive to maintain and operate, and would require significant
investments for rehabilitation, could be a cost effective solution.
17.    Three additional cases, designed to shed some light on the cost-effectiveness of the assumed
6/     See footnote 9 below.
7/     The investment figures do not include the costs of completing the 225 MW Dobrotvorsk unit (para 8), and
the cost of recomissioning Chernobyl 2.
8/     The constraints most relevant to this analysis are: (i) the modeling of hydro plants is fairly crude in the
WASP; (ii) the modeling of a rehabilitation of a plant is not possible within a single run and is, therefore,
awkward, time-consuming and heuristic; (iii) most of time-dependent constraints and time-dependent
parameters can not be modeled. These constraints, among other things, may result in the later than optimal
scheduling of the completion of pump storage units.

completion of the nuclear units under construction (Zaporozhye 6, Khmelnitsky 2, and Rovno 4) were
also simulated, based on the cost figures proposed by the joint US DOE/Ukrainian Working Group
(Report of June 23, 1994)9. In these cases, the timing of the completion of nuclear units was not fixed,
i.e., it was left to the software to decide whether it was justified to complete the units, and to determine
the optimal timing of the completion (other assumptions were the same as for Case 1). The US
DOE/Ukrainian Working Group Report discussed three cases. In Case 4, which differ in the level of
safety measures for the three units whose construction is most advanced, Z6 was completed as originally
designed, and K2 and R4 were completed with level 1 safety measures. The costs of the completion were
(in US$ per kW) 34, 257 and 267 for Z6, K2 and R4, respectively. In Case 5, Z6 was completed with
level 1 and 2 safety upgrades, K2 and R4 were completed with level 2 safety upgrades, with
corresponding costs of 110, 303 and 313 US$/kW. Case 6 assumed level "3" safety upgrades for all
three units, with corresponding costs of 216, 439 and 449 US$/kW. It was further assumed that the
Chernobyl 3 unit would not be recommissioned, and the remaining two units would be decommissioned
in 1996-1999, respectively, in all three cases. The following are the least-cost results indicating optimal
timing for completing the units:
Case 4        Case 5         Case 6

9/     The following completion cost figures were assumed by the US DOE/Ukrainian Working Group: Z6: 34,
76, 182; K2: 257, 46, 182; R4: 267, 46, 182. The above costs are in million of 1994 US$, the first
figure includes completion costs and level 1 safety upgrades for K2 and R4, the second figure includes Li
and L2 safety upgrades for Z6, and L2 safety upgrades for K2 and R4 (Ll upgrades for these two units
were included in the completion costs); the third figure includes L3 safety upgrades.

Page 7
18.   In all three cases it was optimal to complete all units under construction, with commissioning
years depending on the level of safety upgrades, i.e., on the completion costs. Furthermore, in all three
cases the least-cost plans contained installing 2 single-cycle gas turbines in 2009 and 3 in 2010, and one
combined-cycle gas turbine in 2009 and another one in 2010 (in addition to completing the nuclear units,
as given above).

UKRAINE
HYDROPOVER REHABILITATION AND SYSTEMS CONTROL PROJECT
Notes to the Financial Statements and Projections
1993 and 1994 Statements
1.           Ukrainian statutory accounting employs a cash system  with elements of accruals
accounting. Revenue is recorded in the income statement only after payment is received, and only at this
point are the associated costs recorded. During periods when there is poor performance in collecting
revenues, the statutory accounts can seriously misstate financial performance, because the costs associated
with uncollected revenues are held off the books, even when they have been incurred in fact.
2.           In order to provide a more meaningful presentation of the financial performance of
Dniprohydroenergo and National Dispatch Center (NDC), their historical financial statements have been
modified to approximate International Accounting Standards (IAS) using accruals accounting. Revenues
represent the imputed sales value of energy and services supplied during each year, irrespective of the
timing of receipt of those revenues. Costs reflect the costs of supplying those services and energy.
3.           Both Dniprohydroenergo and NDC are experiencing difficulty in collecting customer
accounts and meeting their own payments to suppliers, so that there is a difference between their accrued
income and the income they are actually realizing on a timely basis. Under IAS, such delays in collecting
consumer accounts are not reflected on the income statement until the point when accounts are recognized
as being uncollectible and written off, or when inflationary losses on the outstanding receivables are
recognized. Because Ukrainian statutory accounting rules do not recognize either of these concepts (bad
debt or inflationary losses), there has historically been no recognition of the impact that payment delays
have upon a company's income. The contracts, covenants, and tariff rules to be agreed during
negotiation of this project will address these omissions, as discussed below. Projections of income for
years 1995 and beyond contain new line items ("provision for bad debt," and "interest penalty income")
that reflect the measures that were agreed during negotiations to address the problem of delayed revenue
collection. These measures, in effect, will require the companies to begin recognizing bad debt and
inflationary losses, but the resulting losses to the companies will be compensated through tariff-recovery
mechanisms.
4.           The companies' problems in collecting accounts, during 1993 and 1994, can be seen in
the accounts receivable recorded on their balance sheets, and in the changes to accounts receivable
recorded on their cash-flow statements. The NDC's accounts receivable amounted to 96 days of annual
revenue during 1993, and fell to 60 days in 1994. This did not reflect an improvement in collection
performance; rather, it reflected inflation of the revenue stream that serves as a denominator in the ratio.
Dniprohydroenergo had 36 days of receivables in 1993, rising to 45 days in 1994.
5.           The fixed assets of both companies were originally recorded on a cost basis. Costs
recorded during the Soviet era traditionally were below comparable costs in the West. The statutory
depreciation lives for fixed assets are generally far longer than the useful lives applicable under IAS.
Ukraine has experienced severe inflation since 1991, and the book values of the companies' fixed assets



ANNEX 6
Page 2
remain seriously undervalued, despite indexations that have occurred under national law in May 1992 and
August 1993 as well as the most recent revaluation in January 1995. These indices are very broad and
may not accurately reflect the actual worth of the fixed assets.
Assumptions for the Financial Projections
6.            Power Production.  Hydropower production in 1995 and beyond is expected to be
somewhat below recent historical levels. Local personnel report that power has been produced above
sustainable levels by drawing down the water reservoirs, and it is assumed that this cannot continue.
Production of nuclear and thermal power and import/export levels are detailed in the table which follows,
entitled "National Dispatch Center: Assumptions for Electricity Purchases," which follows from Annexes
1 and 3. Cost and tariff assumptions have been discussed in Section C of Chapter III of the main text.
7.            General Financial Assumptions. Assumptions for Ukrainian inflation and US$/Krb
exchange rates are as outlined in Section C of Chapter III of the main text. The US dollar inflation rate
has been assumed at 2.2%.
8.            Tariffs for hydropower are set at a level that covers the costs of existing facilities,
including depreciation and allowed profit margin. In addition, the tariff cost-recovery mechanism
described in Section C of Chapter III of the main text (see also Annex 7, paras. 7 - 9) is included at a
level sufficient to cover costs associated with the World Bank project and to generate additional US$ 8
million equivalent per year of funds for other rehabilitation and investment projects that are expected to
be necessary after the year 2000.
9.            The resale tariff of the National Dispatch Center is set at a level that permits it to recover
its costs of purchased power from all sources, plus an uplift to cover its small costs of operation,
including a profit margin. The actual resale mechanism, which will involve allocation of a portion of
its low cost supplies to the Local Electricity Companies who are its customers, and sale of thermal power
at a wholesale rate reflective of marginal costs, is discussed in paras. 3.4 - 3.5 of the main text.
10.           Both companies were subject to a 22% profits tax prior to 1995 which was based on
revenues minus material costs (operating costs net of costs associated with labor). Ukraine's previous
tax law did not recognize interest on long-term debt or labor costs as deductible items. At the beginning
of 1995, Ukraine introduced a new corporate profit tax of 30% which allows for the deduction of labor
costs before tax. At the time of publication, it was still unclear whether interest on long-term debt would
also be deductible, although it is highly likely that this provision will also be approved. For the purposes
of the financial projections, the new tax law and rate are applied beginning in 1995 assuming that interest
on long-term debt can be expensed.
11.           The hydropower stations pay a 0.8 % - 1.2% road maintenance charge, on the same tax
base that is used for the profits tax. Proceeds go to a local government entity or are retained by the
hydropower station, depending on where the plant is located and the division of responsibility for road
maintenance. Contributions to the Chernobyl fund are paid by both organizations, under national law,
and are treated here as a labor-related cost in operating expenses. Similar treatment is accorded to
payments to the unemployment fund, assessed at 1 % of the profits tax base, and statutory worker benefits
such as the insurance fund.



ANNEX 6

12.          Company-Specific Assumptions. The projected balance sheets take into account the
indexation announced as of January 1995 according to an approximation of the age of assets. The actual
indexation will inevitably be slightly different because it is impossible to guess the exact acquisition date
of the assets. A more thorough revaluation, aimed at determining the proper value of existing assets, has
not been performed in the context of this analysis. Thus, the assets to be added under the World Bank
loan, because they will be properly valued when booked, appear on the balance sheets to make up a
disproportionate share of the total fixed assets of the two companies.
13.          For the companies' statutory accounting and reporting requirements, the new assets
created under this project will be treated according to the usual rules prescribed by Ukrainian law. Such
rules involve useful lives that are in some cases much longer than would be called for under IAS. For
this reason, an attempt has been made to apply IAS standard useful lives and depreciation methods in
developing the income projections included in this Annex.
14.          Both companies make a number of statutory fund contributions, which are tied to their
profitability after tax. These are currently paid to Minenergo, which uses them as retained earnings to
be distributed among the organizations within its structure. It is assumed that, after the restructuring of
the power industry, such fund contributions would cease and the resulting funds would remain at the
disposal of the corporatized Dniprohydroenergo and NDC/Energomarket. Such funds are thus treated
as part of equity on the balance sheets of the companies.
15.          Standard ratios such as the current ratio and quick ratio appear highly distorted,
particularly for Dniprohydroenergo, during some of the forecast years. This is simply an artifact of the
tariff cost-recovery mechanism that is being adopted to ensure recovery of project-related costs. This
mechanism will cause large capital costs of the project to be passed through tariffs on a current basis, as
cash is spent on local investment costs and on the subsequent repayment of the World Bank loan. The
tariff cost-recovery mechanism increases billed tariffs, and hence increases the companies' accounts
receivable. At the same time, the associated project costs, being capital in nature, are not reflected in
the companies' routine, course-of-business accounts payable.   This is particularly true for
Dniprohydroenergo, which is very capital-intensive but has very low current liabilities. For this reason,
standard ratios (such as current assets over current liabilities) achieve very high values during the peak
years of tariff cost-recovery. Under the circumstances, such ratios have limited information value.
16.          The projections embody the tariff, contract, and covenant provisions that were agreed
during loan negotiations. Specifically, resale tariffs for the NDC include an allowance for bad debt as
described in Section C of Chapter III. Such an allowance is not included for the Dniprohydroenergo,
because it is assumed that NDC (its only customer) will settle its accounts in full within 20 days of
billing, as will be required in the contract between NDC and Dniprohydroenergo. Both companies will
be entitled to collect interest penalties on outstanding receivables not paid within 20 days. It is assumed
that Dniprohydroenergo will be paid promptly and hence no interest-penalty income is shown on its
statements. However, it is assumed that NDC will have income from interest penalties during the project
period, because the average age of its receivables will be reduced to 60 days in 1995, 40 days in 1996,
35 days in 1997, and 30 days thereafter (para. 3.16). This interest-penalty income has been calculated
based on the average number of days receivables during each of the years; the penalty would apply after
the 20th day, and would accrue at a rate calculated to compensate NDC for its implicit loss from
extending trade credit and provide an incentive for prompt payment.

HYDROPOWER REHABILITATION AND SYSTEM CONTROL PROJECT
Financial Rate of Return Calculation for
Dniprohydroenergo
1.            Revenues.  The project will produce incremental revenue through two mechanisms.
First, it will result in incremental output (i.e., positive difference between the electricity output under the
"with" and "without the project" scenarios). Second, the tariff structure to be adopted in connection with
the project will result in an incremental cost-recovery mechanism that will be charged on all output (pre-
existing and incremental output associated with the project), beginning in 1995. In standard regulatory
practice, this conforms to "rolled-in" rate treatment, whereunder all ratepayers bear a ratable share of
the cost of making improvements to their system. Such treatment is appropriate in instances, such as this,
where benefits of the project (e.g., enhanced reliability, prevention of losses in capacity over time) accrue
to all parties who currently consume hydropower.
2.            Taxation. It is assumed that revenues associated with the cost-recovery mechanism will
be subjected to the same taxation regime as other revenues of Dniprohydroenergo. This includes a 30%
"'profits" tax, a 1 % road-maintenance assessment, and a 1 % unemployment fund contribution, all of
which operate off the same tax base. The base for such taxes and assessments is revenue minus "material
costs." These material costs include operating costs with the exception of labor costs. During the years
of construction when the tariff cost-recovery mechanism will be generating funds to pay for local
construction costs, the new facilities will not result in any addition to Dniprohydroenergo's operating
costs, and incremental revenues are not offset by an incremental deduction. Thus, it is assumed that
100% of the incremental revenue stream will be subjected to these three taxes, totalling 32%.
3.            As discussed in Annex 6, Ukraine's tax law is subject to change, including the possible
introduction of a deduction for interest on long-term debt. The rate of return is not sensitive to this
uncertainty, since it is assumed that any resulting reductions in tax would be flowed through to consumers
via reductions in the tariff.
4.            Operating Costs. The operating cost reduction is the same that is assumed for purposes
of calculating the economic rate of return, however, it has been converted to current dollars assuming
a US dollar inflation rate of 2.2%.
5.            Project Costs. The project costs are in current dollars and reflect the local and foreign
investment costs and the commitment fee on a "cash-flow" basis as spent.
6.            Rate of Return and Sensitivities. The financial internal rate of return is 13.5% on a
real basis, and 16.0% on a current basis. This compares favorably to Dniprohydroenergo's estimated



ANNEX 7
Page 2
cost of capital, 8.5%, reflecting the estimated cost of borrowing under this project' (1.5% on-lending
interest rate, plus 7.0% estimated World Bank rate). It is assumed that any reductions in project costs,
or reasonable cost increases within the allowed contingencies, would be flowed through to consumers via
a reduction/increase in the tariff. For this reason, the rate of return is not sensitive to changes in project
costs. It is sensitive to the extent to which the forecast operating cost reductions and incremental
electricity output are achieved. Risks associated with those factors have been discussed in the section on
economic rate of return.
7.             Because of Ukraine's high inflation rate and due to volatility in the Karbovanets/hard
currency exchange rates, the beneficiaries would be at risk unless their tariff formulas provide a close
match between actual cash outlays under the project, and the recovery of such costs. The cost-recovery
mechanism has been designed to minimize this risk, thus reducing the sensitivity of the financial rate of
return to inflation and exchange-rate movements. An alternative, more standard, recovery mechanism
would have been recovery of investment costs through customary depreciation of the new assets.
Customary depreciation typically results in over-recovery of investment outlays in early years, and under-
recovery in later years. The beneficiaries would be required to invest over-recovered funds in a way that
keeps pace with inflation and exchange-rate movements, for use in years when there is an under-recovery,
placing them at considerable risk. Because of these risks, a more direct tariff cost-recovery mechanism
will be used in place of customary depreciation. The cost recovery mechanism will fully recover local
investment costs and the small commitment fee on an annual basis as spent, during the years 1995-2000.
Obligations for the commitment fee would be converted to Krb at the then-applicable exchange rate.
Interest on the loan incurred during construction will be capitalized and included in the loan balance;
therefore, tariff recovery of accrued interest costs during these years will be deferred until such time as
loan repayment commences. At the end of the 5-year grace period, loan repayment will commence and
continue for 12 years. At that time, amounts equal to the beneficiaries' actual loan-service obligations
will be recovered through prices, with conversion to hard currency at the then-applicable exchange rates.
8..            During the early years of loan repayment, the cost-recovery mechanism will result in
slightly lower prices than would be the case if customary asset depreciation had been used. In later years,
there will be correspondingly higher recovery of investment principal through rates. Thus, the cost-
recovery mechanism tends to defer revenue, and hence reduces the financial rate of return somewhat.
However, as noted above, it significantly reduces the risk surrounding the estimated rate of return.
Dniprohydroenergo has no other long-term debt upon which to base its average cost of borrowing, and its
cost of equity is unclear as its assets remain under state ownership.

ANNEX 8

HYDROPOWER REHABILITATION AND SYSTEMS CONTROL PROJECT
Economic Analysis
1.           An economic analysis, based on incremental costs and benefits derived from the
with/without project approach, was conducted on the two main components separately and then integrated
for the project as whole. Project total indicators of economic benefits also reflect the investment costs
associated with the dam safety monitoring and technical assistance components, for which no benefits
were quantified. All figures are expressed in constant 1994 U.S. dollars. A summary discussion of
the methodology of the economic analysis and main findings are provided in Chapter III.E. This Annex
outlines the basic assumptions used and presents the detailed results for the project as a whole and its
main components, including plant-by-plant results for the hydropower rehabilitation component (Tables
1-10).
Basic Assumptions
A. Hydropower Rehabilitation
2.           Electricity Prices. The average economic price of electricity is forecast to increase from
the equivalent of UScent 2/kWh in 1995 to UScent 3/kWh in 2005 and remain at that level thereafter.
The economic price approximates the estimated long-run marginal cost. The average economic price was
used for the valuation of off-peak sales (one-fifth of the total). For the balance of sales, the peak
economic price was used, which is 35% higher than the average price.
3.           Availability.  Under the "without" rehabilitation scenario, it is assumed that  (i)
electricity production falls by 0.5% per year due to reduced availability caused by growing plant
deterioration; and (ii) a lower percentage (79% instead of 80%) of electricity can be sold at peak time
due to the reduced availability of the generating units. Under the "with" project case, (i) electricity
output declines at a rate of 0. 1% after completion of the rehabilitation; and (ii) 80% of the energy is sold
at the peak price to reflect higher availability.
4.           Efficiency Increase.  Based on actual equipment testing, the rehabilitated units, in
addition to regaining original name-plate efficiency, are expected to achieve on average an incremental
efficiency gain of about 4% (expressed as increased energy production per year) due to the more modem
design of new equipment (turbines, generators, transformers) and materials. Over half of the full-load
efficiency increase results from the more efficient turbines. The efficiency increase is reflected in the
analysis beginning in the third year of the implementation period, with the full efficiency benefit realized
one year after the completion of the investment.
5.           Operation and Maintenance. For 1994, real values for the O&M costs were obtained
from local sources and converted to U.S. dollars at the exchange rate of 50,000 Krb per US$. To reflect



ANNEX 8
Page 2
the current undervaluation in U.S. dollar terms of labor, materials and other items, O&M costs were
assumed to rise by 10% per year from 1995 to 2000, and by 5% per year thereafter under both the
"with" and "without" project cases. The rehabilitation is expected to generate savings in O&M costs
relative to the "without" project situation. To reflect this, O&M costs increase at a lower rate under the
rehabilitation scenario, following the slope of an empirically determined curve that relates the rate of
change in O&M costs to the age of the plants.  Rehabilitation is essentially taken as the equivalent of
a "reduction" in the assumed age of the plant, with the reduction depending on the scope of the
rehabilitation.
B. System Control Rehabilitation
6             The main benefits associated with this component were quantified in terms of fuels saved
as a result of improved (lower cost) allocation of total generation requirement among the generating
units and improved power flow in the system. The achievable fuel savings were conservatively assumed
at 2.5% of the annual fuel requirements (1.25% from 1997 to 1999 to reflect partial implementation).
The underlying generation forecast for the period 1995-2020 was based on the electricity demand
projection presented in Annex 1. As a result of the upgrade of communications, dispatch and system
control under the proposed project, about one-third of the thermal capacity would become available for
automatic economic dispatch. Fuel savings were valued at the projected economic price of heavy fuel
oil, natural gas and coal (see Annex 3 for the fuel price forecast).
7.           Investment Costs.  For each project component, investment costs used in the economic
analysis are based on detailed cost estimates in Annex 5. They include a 15 % physical contingency
allowance for all components. Because of the current undervaluation in U.S. dollars of locally procured
investment items, local investment costs also include 50% of the price contingency to reflect anticipated
relative increases in unit prices of such inputs.

HYDROPOWER REHABILITATION AND SYSTEM CONTROL PROJECT
Performance Indicators
1.    The following indicators will be used to measure the effectiveness of project implementation
and operation:
A. Technical Indicators
For hydropower plants:
(i)    Nominal and maximum operating capacity (MW) for each unit. The following are
estimates of the nominal capacities (in MW) of the individual generating units in the
plants after rehabilitation:
Kiev:               19.9
Kremenchug:         56.6
Dniproderzhinsk:    52.2
Dnieper I:          79.8
Kakhovka:           52.2
It is expected that total increase in system capacity after the rehabilitation will be 130
MW;
(ii)   Total energy produced and energy sales (GWh/year). Total energy sales are expected
to reach an average of 10,800 GWh/year over the next five years after rehabilitation
(assuming normal water inflows, i.e., equal to the historical average);
(iii)   Total inflows into reservoir, total water turbined, total water spilled (thousand cubic
meters/year);
(iv)   Target turbine efficiency, for each unit (%), to be achieved after rehabilitation
Kiev:               4.3 %
Kremenchug:         3.4 %
Dniproderzhinsk:    4.2 %
Dnieper I:          3.5 %
Kakhovka:           3.9 %
For National Dispatch Center:
(v)    Compared to 1994/95, reduction in ihe deviation of maximunm and minimum
frequency from the 50 liz target, and reduction of the monthly maximum accumulated



ANNEX 12

time error (sec);
(vi)   Compared to 1994/95, reduction in the number, amount (MW) and duration of load
curtailments per year;
(vii)   Real time economic dispatch software installed, tested, and operating by June 30,
1999.
B. Financial Indicators
(viii)  NDC's account receivables should not exceed 60 days in 1995, 40 days in 1996, 35
days in 1997, and 30 days thereafter;
(ix)   Maintaining the required debt service ratio (1.5) and self financing ratio (40%) by
Dniprohydroenergo and NDC during the project period.
C. Proiect Implementation
(x)    Actual timing of procurement actions by bid package (bid specifications, invitation for
bidding, opening of bids, evaluation reports, award of contract, contract signing)
against the schedule;
(xi)   Actual installation of equipment against the project schedule;
(xii)   Actual disbursements against the disbursement schedule.

HYDROPOWER REHABILITATION AND SYSTEM CONTROL PROJECT
Supervision Plan
1.    The supervision is expected to require about 25 staff weeks per fiscal year during the first two
years of implementation, and 15 staff weeks per year thereafter. The schedule below is in addition to
the regular review requirements for procurement actions, progress reports and correspondence,
estimated to be about 9 staff weeks per year in the first two years, and 7 staff weeks per year
thereafter.
