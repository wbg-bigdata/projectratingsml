DEVELOPMENT BANKING PROJECT
(LOAN 2477-CO)
PREFACE
This is a Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Development Banking
Project (DBP) in Colombia for which Loan 2477-CO of US$90.0 million was approved
by the Executive Directors on November 6, 1984. US$84.7 million was disbursed
by the original closing date of June 30, 1990 and the remainder of the loan
cancelled upon the closing of the loan account in October 1990. US$14.4 million
had been repaid as at April 30, 1991 by the Borrower, the Colombian Central Bank
(Banco de la Republica, or BR).
The PCR was prepared by the Trade, Finance and Industry Division of
Country Department III of the Latin America and Caribbean Region.   BR has
submitted its own assessment of the Project, which has been translated from
Spanish to English by the Bank, which is presented as Part II of this Report.
The PCR was compiled on the basis of information available in the LAC
Info' ation Center, the Staff Appraisal Report, reports produced by BR and the
Project's participating financial intermediaries (PPIs), a report of a consultant
engaged by the Bank whose selection and terms of reference were agreed upon with
BR, correspondence with the Bank, and staff Supervision Reports.

(LOAN 2477-CO)
EVALUATION SUNMARY
Proiect ObJectives and Description
1.        The Development Banking Project  (DBP) was prepared in late 1983
following an era of marginal industrial growth and reversals in the comprehensive
financial sector reform undertaken in the mid-1970s. Bank support for Colombian
industry up to that time had consisted of three enterprise-specific operations,
three credit lines for smaller scale industrial development, and eight credit
lines for larger scale industry. The operations for larger scale industry had
utilized eight relatively well performing local development banks (CFe) as
participating financial intermediaries (PFIs). It had also focused successfully
upon encouraging their institutional development and fostering the capacity of
the borrower, the Central Bank of Colombia (BR), to progressively take over the
oversight of 6 subproject appraisal and supervision functions. The DBP marked
an opportunity in the Bank's eyes to increasingly address broader financial
sector issues (paras. 1-3).
2.        The DBP loan was made as part of the Bank's strategy to support the
Government's own efforts to reform and strengthen the financial system. Its
4mmediate objectives were to (a) make available to PFIs longer term financing for
subloans and equity participations to support industrial investments; and (b)
strengthen through technical assistance the institutions implementing financial
sector reforms. The credit component of the Project was supported by US$89.8
million of the US$90 million Bank lo&n (the remainder covered the capitalized
front-end fee of the loan) and was paralleled by an IDB loan of an identical
amount. All CFs were eligible to become PFIs, provided that each met one of two
groups of criteria.   The interest rates to PFIs were substantially free of
subsidies, though the 3-4 percentage point fixed spreads were markedly below
those for commercial market operations. The financing of technology development,
pollution control, technical assistance and equity investments was encouraged via
special maturities, grace periods and foreign exchange risk arrangements for
subloans.   BR and PFI staff were to receive training under the Project-s
technical assistance component, financed by BR and the Government, in the
promotion and evaluation of investments projects, project supervision and term
transformation control. The Superintendency of Banks (SB) was to impro're its
information monitoring systems, inspection and analyses of financial institutions
(paras. 4-7).

Implementation and Results
3.        The loan was signed and made effective within four months of Board
presentation and disbursed by the original loan Closing Date. The loan supported
195 sublcans for 150 subprojects undertaken b-y 147 enterprises (a number of
subprojects had a syndication of two or more subloans).  Loan proceeds were
devoted almost entirely to covering the foreign exchange requirements of fixed
assets and represented about 17Z of the Project's total investment cost.
Enterprises themselves contributed an average of 34Z of total cost, while
parallel directed credit of BR su?ported 30% and PFIs met 192 of total costs.
Eight CFs acted as PI'Is for the Project, of which three ac^ounted for nearly two-
thirds of the volume (paras. 15-16).
4.        About one-half of the Bank's loan volume went to larger Colombian
enterprises with total assets exceeding US$2.5 million, and about three-quarters
of the loan volume went to enterprises involved in chemical products, printing
and  publishing,  textiles  and  agroindustry.    Subprojects  for  technology
development, pollution control and equity participations totaled about 1.3Z of
loan volume, substantially below appraisal estimates of 201 for these purposes.
Though some 23 subprojects (12S of the total) represented the creation of new
enterprises, this is likely (data is incomplete) to be substantially below
appraisal estimates of the 35-40% for new enterprise creation and product line
innovation (para. 21).
5.        An ex post analysis of a sample of subloans (23% of the total Bank
loan) suggested that about two thirds of the subprojects aimed to increase
production capacity and achieved increases of 60Z-1001. This was a substantially
higher number of subprojects than suggested by survey data at appraisal (201-
251), and probably reflects expectations by PFIs that, as for domestic directed
credit, BR accorded a first priority to subloans financing capacity expansion
over those increasing the efficiency of existing capacity.    Still,  most
subprojects had an element of technical change with the purchase of new equipment
and efficiency increases were detected in most cases.  The aggregate average
revised financial rate of return amounted to 17.5% against original expectations
of 22.51, substantially in line with appraisal estimates. Employment generated
by the subproject sample was equivalent to 12.3% of those employed at subproject
appraisal (paras. 22-24).
6.        Over 1987-89, the SB gradually strengthened prudential regulations and
its enforcement capacity, though no indication was found that this was directly
a part of the Project-related program. As urged by the Bank's sector work, a
decree was adopted to help eliminate the major gap in performance between CFs
traditionally acting as PFIs in Bank loans and other CFs. The SB established
unified accounting standards for financial institutions and criteria and
procedures for portfolio assessment and classification. These steps as well as
the reinforcement of SB personnel and equipment substantially improved the
transparency of financial sector information and improved the accuracy of
indicators of its liquidity, solvency, efficiency and portfolio risk. Over 1985-
89, nearly all CF. increased their capital substantially in real terms so as to
return debt:equity ratios to sound levels, increased profitability above pre-
recession levels, and markedly reduced non-performing assets.   This was due



- v -
generally to a combination of strong gtowth in aggregate demand stemming from
gcod macroeconomic management, deliberate efforto to
mobilize more equity capital and work out non-performing assets (NPA), and higher
finaocial margins on longer-term capital intermediation. By 1990, all 16 CFO had
also met the eligibility criteria established by the Government in 1987 (paras.
25-28).
7.        All but one CF substantially maintained the Project's PFI eligibility
criteria, and BR and the Government were in substantial compliance with the
covenants in the Loan and Guarantee Agreements. Overall Project supervision by
BR was of good quality.   BR performed well its responsibilities for the
verification of expenditures, procurement and reporting. However, several of its
practices reduced ito effectiveness. These mainly involved its performance of
ex post appraisals of subprojects within PFI free limits, which led PIls to delay
disbursements some 50-60 days to ensure that approved subloan rediscounts were
not canceled ex post by SR. Further delay and friction occurred bstween BR and
PFIo over terms of subloans, as the former souSht to expedite repayment of funds
while the latter aimed to accommodate client concerns (paras. 17-21).
Findinas and Lessons
8.        The DBP met most of its immediate objectives on foreseen in the
provision of longer-term credit to :arge scale Colombian industry, reinforcement
of financial sector reforms associated with CFs and enhancement of supervision
capabilities. The Project departed from those preceeding by helping to implant
the use of variable rates for lending operations, an important early stop to
facilitate term transformation, the development of a longer-term capital market
and sustainable term financing. These changes have proven to be central to the
financial sector and durable. Its supervision of PFIs was al;o good, though it
could have been improved by helping to correct some of BR's costly practices.
As is now the case with subsequent Bank operations, DBP implementation by BR
would have bonefitted from greater decentralization of subloan appraisal ond
approval to PFIs through higher free lflmits, simplification of directed credit
regulations, and increased ex post monitoring (paras. 28-30).
9.        The Project's design was generally well geared to its objectives.
However, ad in proceding Bank loans, its mechanisms to encourage now PFI entry
of CPs operating in the short-term market, reduced credit concentration in large
scale firms, technology development, pollution control and equity financing were
ineffective and unrealistic in the absence of an appropriate enabling
environment. It was also unable to influence the oligopolistic control of five
CFo over this segment of the financial market and the high coscentration of their
portfolios in associated enterprise lntersets (paras. 8-14).
10.       In Colombia's highly trade-protected environment of the 1980s, it
is most unlikely that the investments financed under the Project reconfigured
enterprise so as to be internationally competitive. As the sample evaluation
indicates, however, it is likely to have reduced the competitiveness gap which
firms must now overcome following the substantial acceleration of trade reforms
undertaken by Colombia in 1990.  It also helped to create the basis for the
change in focus of the financial reform process, which was articulated at about



_ vi -
the same time as the trade reform, from improvements in prudential regulations
and the financial condition of instiltions to inc'easing the competitiveness and
efficiency of the sector (para. 32).
11.       In this sense, the DBP was an important transitional forerunner to the
Bank's subsequent loan, approved in May 1991, to support industrial restructuring
Und development. This operation helped to foster and is predicated upon these
broader refcrus in the real and financial sectors.   The breadth of the
Government's current financial sector reform program offers real hope of reducing
institutional concentration, which Bank credit line projects up through the DBP
implicitly supported, and of establishing l _   term capital market mechanisms
(para. 33).

1.2 Background
1.          The Development Banking Project (DBP) was prepared in late 1983 and
early 1984 following four years of marginal growth in Colombia's industrial
output and declining exports.   This performance was due ostensibly to weak
domestic and international demand, an overvalued Peso, increased quota
restrictions and tariff rates, and competition from contraband. However, over
the longer run, manufacturing was also characterized by volatile growth, a
relatively independent regional market structure, an unusually prominent consumer
goods industry, and declining labor absorption as (largely export-oriented)
labor-intensive production fell in relation to that of (largely domestic-market
oriented) capital intensive industries.
2.          T'he decline in investment which had accompanied the retu2n to a
highly protected market 1eft many facilities obsolete. Project preparation work
thus identified a critical need to modernize the industrial base in orier to
reduce product cost and improve quality. Yet, a number of major issues untercut
the financia3 sector's ability to support this modernization. In particular, a
comprehens4!.-i financial sector liberalization in 1974 had been largely reversed
in an effort to contain strong inflationary pressures by the imposition of
restrictive interest rate ceilings, renewed emphasis on forced investments and
selective credit allocation.  In addition, the Colombian development banking
system (Corporacion Financieras, or CFs), which had been established in the early
1960s by commercial banks to provide medium- and long-term debt and equity
financing to private productive firms primarily in the industrial sector, was
operating mainly in the short-term market or in longer-term funds rediscounted
by the Colombian Central Bank (Banco de la Republica, or BR).
3.          Enterprise-specific Bank support to Colombian industry up to 1984 was
associated mainly with steel and nickel exploitation enterprises and an export
processing zone.  The Bank had providti three credit lines totaling US$52.5
million to BR through the Corporacion Financiera Popular to finance small and



-2-
medium scale enterprises.  It had also made eight credit lines totaling US$493
million to R since 1966, which on-lent the funds to qualifying CFs designed to
encourage efficient, productive invesments of large scale industry. Eight of the
16 private sector CFs in Colombia had acted as participating financial
intermediaries (PIsl) under most of these loans.   These loans had focused
successfully upon both assisting the institutional development of the CFO and
fostering the capacity within BR to progressively take over the subproject
appraisal and supervision functions of the Bank.  It was felt during Project
preparation that this was a turning point which enabled the Bank to increasingly
address broader financial sector issues.
1.3 Prolect Obiactives and Descriltion
4.          The DBP loan was made as part of the Bank's strategy to support the
Government's own efforts to reform and strengthen the financial system.  Its
immediate objectives were to:
(a;   make available to PFIs medium-term financing for subloans and equity
participations   to   support   efficient   investments   in   the
manufacturing, agro-industrial, tourism and mining sectors; and
(b)   strengthen  through  the provision  of  technical  assistance  the
institutions implementing financial sector reforms in developing
long-term credit market mechanisms, operating the variable interest
rate system and enhancing banking sulpervisory capabilities.
s.          The credit component of the Project was supported by US$89.8 million
of the US$90 million Bank loan (the remainder covered the capitalized front-end
fee of the loan) and was paralleled by an IDB loan of an identical amount. The
loan was to finance the estimated foreign exchange cost of fixed assets,
permanent working capital and technical assistance services required by
industries. No enterprise or investment was to receive subloans of more than
US$5 million equivalent (US$3 million as equity), in order to help reduce the
concentration of credit in the largest enterprises.
6.            All CFa were eligible to become PFIs provided that each met one of
two groups of criteria, namely that a CF's (a) total debs:equity ratio did not
exceed 10:1 (both Groups A and B), (b) minimum equity capital was at least
Col$500 million (Group A) or Col$300 million (initially for G>ap B), and (c)
meodir- and long-term loans plus equity investments were not less than 552 of
tota. assets (Group A) or 30Z (initially for Group B).   For Group B PlIs, Bank
loan commitments were not to exceed the lower of two times its equity or US$10
million. The interest rate on US Dollar-denominated subloans to enterprises was
set at the London Interbank Offering Rate (LIBOR) on 180-day deposits plus 2.5
perce3tage points and peso-denominated loans bore a floating rate of the
certificate of deposit (CDT) plus 3 percentage points, approximating a prime rate
equivalent.   Spreads to PeIs were 3 percentage points for the former and 4
percentage points for the latter. Enterprises had the option to denominate the
fi;:st US$0.5 million equivalent in Pesos or US Dollars, with any excess required
to be in US Dollars.  An exception to this was made for subloans to finance
technology development, pollution control, technical assistance and equity



-3-
investments, for which up to US$2 millior. equivalent could be in Pesos. This was
expected to result in a relatively higher proportion of Peso financing going to
smaller firms, though the total was not expected to exceed 50% of the total loan.
7.          Under the technical assistance program,  BR and PFI staff were to
receive training in the promotion and evaluation of investment projects, project
supervision and term transformation control. The Superintendency of Banks (SB)
was to improve its information monitoring systems, inspection and analyses of
financial institutions. BR and tha Government were to finance their respective
parts of the program and a detailed action program was to be presented for Bank
comment within 6 months of loan signing and implemented promptly (.hereafter.
1.4 Proiect Design and Organization
8.          From available information, the Project's design appears to have beer,
well understood and accepted by those primarily concerned, namely BR and the
PFIs.  This Was due undnubtedly to experi.ence acquired from the substantial
number of previous credit line projects involving these entities, the Bank
financial sector work completed in 1983. as well as to the Colombian and Bank
staff time invested prior to Project start-up (79.7 Bank staff weeks (sw) through
Project appraisal and 9.4 sw thereafter through Board approval).
9.          The Project's design was generally well geared to its objectives.
The Bank made a substantial effort in collaboration with the Colombian financial
authorities prior to making the DBP loan to address the financial sector
constraints to real sector development in its 1983 sector report.  The most
positive aspects of Project design were derived from some of the key
recommendations related to CFs participation in the Project made by this work.
Most importantly, it based subloan interest rates on the newly created
certificate of deposit floating rate indicator (the CDT rate) as a means of
linking rates to the marginal cost of funds and promoting a suitable term
transformation instrument to help encourage longer-term financial markets. To
further increase profitability and improve overall financial condition, it
included increased spreads or the subloans under the Bank's loan and the PFI
eligibility criteria outlined in para 7 above.
10.         The Bank had also prepared a set of broader recommendations for
financial sector reform aimed to improve resource allocation and develop capital
markets, though these were not included in the DBP. In particular, it proposed
the progressive liberalization of interest rates, the elimination of other
restrictions such as forced investments, lower exposure limits on loans to one
firm or group, restraints on interlocking elr ectorates between financial and resl
sector firms, and greater clarity in the roles of different kinds of financial
institutions. It further urged tax reforms to eliminate biases against equity
financing, exemption of CFs from forced investment requirements and new
requirements forcing all CF. to adopt minimum capital structure standards. While
substantial changes were eventually made in tax regulations, exposure limits,
intersectoral ownership and CF capital structure requirements, action on most
other fundamental reform steps was deferred.



- 4 -
II.         The Government agreed to include in the DBP those adjustments which
were closely associated with and justifed by the immediate Project objective of
ensuring the provision of credit to industry by CFs. This Government policy has
been consistent with respect to Bank loans involving the financial sector and it
is unlikely, even had today's strong tradition of sector adjustment lending been
as strong when the loan was made, that the Bank would have been able to
Incorporate broader reforms.   Recent agreement between the Bank and the
Government on it medium-term financial reform program, upon which a series of
Bank loans depend, is likely to be a more viable approach.
12.         Several mechanisms in the Project's design sought to achieve results
which, in reality, could not be brought about by the Project preparation work
undertaken and credit program regulations alone. The establishment of a Group
B eligiblity category to encourage smaller CF. operating predominently in the
short-term market to move increasingly to the longer-term market was a creative
step failing the adoption by the Government of across-the-board capital structure
standards for CFs. However, CF. which were not already members of the "World
Bank club" (Colombian terminology) were not adequately motivated to do so. This
was most probably aue both to the weakened condition of many financial
institutions in the wake of the recessionary years of the early 1980s and to the
fact that profitability in short-term instruments at commercial rates still
exceeded the fixed margins under the Project.
13.         Technology (not explicitly defined in Project documentation) and
pollution control subprojects, as well as equity and technical assistance
fLnancing, were accorded incentives under the Project like extended maturity and
grace periods and higher ceilings for peso financing. Skeletal checklists were
also provided as guides to examining such subprojects.   It is instructive,
however, that almost no subproject with these designations were financed by the
loan. Clearly, the more fundamental enabling conditions which would drive demand
for such financing were lacking, as was the sense of proportionality of what
results could reasonably be expected from these very modest incentives.
14.         In addition, subloan ceilings were established with the apparent
intention of limiting credit access to larger firms. While the concentration of
loan proceeds in larger firms may have been reduced, it did not slow the overall
concentration accorded to them by the Colombia's financial markets. Similarly,
the use of a maximum subloan limit to handle foreign exchange risk, which was
intended to address the perceived greater reluctance of smaller enterprises to
accept such obligations, is not likely to have increased materially the access
of smaller enterprises to term financing. In fact, it probably acted more to
motivate enterprises to reduce subproject and/or subloan size in order to qualify
for peso financing.
1.5 Project Implementation
15.         The loan was signed on November 27, 1984, within one month of Board
approval, and made effective three months later. As per one of the two Project
risks identified in the SAR, loan commitments were made at a pace slower than
expected because of the major stabilization program undertaken by the Government
in 1985 and to the priority given by BR to the IDB loan already in place. The



Commitment Closing Date was consequently extended from December 1986 to December
1988.   However,  strong aggregate demand over most of 1986-88 accelerated
commitments and the loan was fully disbursed by the original Closing Date of June
30, 1990. While US$89.3 million of the loan was committed, US$84.6 million was
actually disbursed due to cancellations of previous subloan commitments.
16.         The loan supported 195 subloans for 150 subprojects undertaken by 147
enterprises (a number of subprojects had a syndication of two or more subloans),
which was consistent with appraisal estimates of 100-150 subprojects.   The
average subloan was US$479,000 equivalent, with its proceeds devoted almost
entirely to covering the foreign exchange requirements of fixed assets.  The
Bank's loan represented about 172 of the Project's total investment cost.
Enterprises themselves contributed an average of 34% of total cost, while
parallel directed credit of BR supported 301 and PFIs met 19Z of total costs.
About 761 of these subloans were peso-denominated and represented 491 of the loan
volume, as estimated at appraisal. Eight CFs acted as PFIs for the Project, of
which three accounted for nearly two-thirds of the volume: CF del Valle (26.2%),
CF Colombiana (21.52), and CF Nacional (14.4%). The PFIs were responsible for
the preparation, appraisal and supervision of subprojects.
17.         BR, through its Department of Industrial Credit, was responsible for
the overall supervision of PFIs.   In general, the procedures used by BR
corresponded to those required by the Loan Agreement. Appraisal and supervision
procedures were thorough and of good quality, and PFIs repected the professional
quality of BR staff. BR performed well tne verification of expenditures and
fulfilled its responsibilities of closely monitoring items financed by the Bank
loan and ensuring that they were reasonably priced and appropriate for their
intended use. Reporting and monitoring procedures were also adequate, though
they could have been improved with more decentralized computer systems to provide
more specific data on subloans.   BR and the Government were in substantial
compliance with the covenants in the Loan and Guarantee Agreements. All CF. met
the Project's standards for minimum equity, debt:equity and the specialization
ratios excepting CF Occidente, which was made ineligible as it fell short of the
debt:equity ratio ceiling.
18.         Several BR practices, however, reduced its effectiveness as the
second-tier credit management institution.  BR applied procedures similar to
those utilized for domestic directed credit lines it managed which, given the
subsidies involved, implied substantial ex ante controls over expenditures of
"scarce" resources. Consequently, although the loan established a free limit
between the PFI and BR of US$250,000 equivalent, all subprojects under the free
limit were appraised by BR on an ex Dost basis. Since PFIs wished to avoid ex
post cancellation of rediscounts, they delayed disbursements until subprojects
had been approved by BR.   This process  took an average of 50-60 days,
substantially slowing the process, Further delay and friction occurred between
BR and PFIs over terms of subloans. Whereas the PFI aimed foremost to meet
clients' business concerns, BR aimed mainly to ensure control over and to
expedite the repayment of funds. In addition, many cancellations of subloans
were apparently due to the substantial formal exchanges of correspondence
required when changes were necessary in suppliers and/or to minor adjustments
made in equipment specifications.



-6-
19.         The Project provided for subloan free limits of US$3 million of Group
A PFIs and US$750,000 of Group B PFlI, and an equity free limit of US$650,000.
The Bank actually reviewed ex ante 16 subprojects (excluding 13 additional
requests for increases) accounting for 22% of loan volume, which was comparable
to appraisal estimates. Ex ante review of subprojects above the free limit
averaged an estimated 2.1 sw per year and the processing of subprojects within
the free limit averaged 0.75 sw per year (including increases and cancellations)
of the responsible division in the Projects Department (now LA3TF) during the
loan commltment period. Annual loan supervision work by the Bank averaged a
reasonable 13.5 sw and was focused, particularly in the early years of
implementation, on monitoring the financial performance of PFIs and encouraging
steps to reduce portfolio arrears.
20.         Regarding the technical assistance component, BR provided training
on supervision policies and procedures and the SB undertook a substantial
upgrading program. However, there was no record found in the preparation of this
Report of a submission by BR or the SB of an explicit Project-related technical
assistance program, nor of Project-related resources explicitly being associated
with these improvements.
1.6 Proiect Results and Sustainabilitv
21.         Investment.  As expected, about one-half of the Bank's loan volume
went to large Colombian enterprises with total assets exceeding US$2.5 million
(Table 1.1).   About three-quarters of the loan volume went to enterprises
involved in chemical products, printing and publishing, textiles and
agroindustry. The geographical distribution of the loan was consistent with the
rather high concentration of industrial value added in Colombia's three principal
cities. Subprojects for technology development and pollution control (4 totaling
US$0.5 million) and equity participations (1 totaling US$0.7 million) totalled
about 1.3Z of loan volume, substantially below appraisal estimates of 20Z
combined for these purposes.   Overall, 23 subprojects (12% of the total)
represented the creation of new enterprises, which is likely to be substantially
below the expectation at appraisal that 35-401 would involve new product lines
and/or new enterprises  L .   Only 2 of the 61 subprojects with subloans
exceeding US$2.5 million represented the creation of new firms, while 13 new
enterprises were created among the 32 subloans in the smallest subloan category
of less than US$420,000 equivalent.
22.         A detailed financial analysis was conducted on a sample of 15
subprojects, accounting for about 81 of the total number and 231 of the total
volume of Bank subloans (Table 1.2). The average subloan size of the sample was
US$1.4 million equivalent, markedly above the Project average and reflective of
the larger, more sohisticated subprojects financed under the Project. Data for
this analysis was provided primarily by BR and PFIs as part of their normal
supervision work and by enterprise interviews. In many cases, readily available
information was related to the enterprises and not to the individual subprojects.
1 / The number of new product lines was not, however, among the
subproject data generated during the Project.



- 7 -
The quality of information and the reliability of the resulting performance
indicators are further reduced by other factors, such as differing financial
statements for tax and operating purposes, inadequate statement detail, transfer
pricing between affiliates, and informal sales of some smaller firms. 2 
23.         Keeping this in mind, the subproject sample reflected delays in
subproject execution in 11 of 15 cases, with the average delay being 7.1 months.
As a result, cost overruns were frequent. About 67% of the number of subprojects
aimed to increase production capacity and achieved increases of 60Z-100. This
was a substantially higher number of subprojects than suggested by survey data
at appraisal (20%-25%), and probably reflects BR's traditional policy whereby
directed credit should be accorded for capacity expansion before increased
efficiency of existing capacity.   Only 4 subprojects in the sample sought
primarily to increase efficiency through changes in the mix of production inputs
and technology. Still, most subprojects had an element of technical change with
the purchase of new equipment and and efficiency increases were detected in 10
of 15 cases.
24.         The average revised financial rate of return (FRR) (excluding two
cases in which subproject implementation was not complete and two others in which
data could not be obtained) amounted to 17.5% against an original expectation of
22.5%. This is substantially in line with appraisal estimates of a range of 152-
30%. All but three revised FRRs exceeded the 11% subproject appraisal threshold
and the overall range was -25.52 to 46.5%. In all 15 cases, debt service was
being paid as agreed. Actual employment generated by the subproject sample,
while varying substantially for each subproject, totaled 1,177 jobs. This is
equivalent to 12.3% of those employed at subproject appraisal. The resulting
average investment cost per job was a high US$181,000, reflecting the fact that
about two-thirds of the sample subloan volume was devoted to moderate to highly
capital intensive subsectors.
25.         Policy and Institutional Changes. The Project's technical assistance
program was expected fundamentally to help improve the performance of the SB, BR
and PFIs and to promote the availability of domestic resources on a longer-term
basis. Over 1987-89, the SB gradually strengthened prudential regulations and
its enforcement capacity. As urged by the Bank in its earlier sector work,
Decree 2041/87 was adopted to help eliminate the major gap in performance between
CFs traditionally acting as PFIs in Bank loans and other CF..  It basically
asserted that all CF. would be required by 1988-90 to meet the eligibility
criteria established under the DBP if they wished to maintain their operations.
This was aimed to help increase solvency through capitalization programs and
profitability via diversification of CF markets and financial services. The
Decree authorized CFs to finance leasing companies and to develop activities such
as factoring, underwriting, and financial restructuring advisory services. The
SB established unified accounting standards for financial institutions and
2 / In the absence of some data, the following main assumptions were
made: (a) the marginal profitability of the enterprise was assumed to be
representative of the subproject's profitability; and (b) total investment
cost per job was computed by dividing the incremental assets by the
incremental number of employees.

criteria and procedures for portfolio assessment and classification. These steps
as well as the reinforcement of SB personnel and equipment substantially improved
the transparency of financial sector information and improved the accuracy of
indicators of its liquidity, solvency, efficiency and portfolio risk.
26.         Over the first half of the 1980s, capital among the 16 private CFs
fell in real terms modestly and debt/equity rose in the aggregate from 6.9 to 9.0
(7.8 for DBP PFIs) (Table 1.3).  In contrast, this indicator for the whole
banking system rose from 10.1 to 42.31   Profitability also deteriorated as net
profits/paid-in capital plus legal reserves fell from an average of 24.1Z in 1981
(29.6Z for PFIs) to -44.21 (15.71 for PFIs). The relatively high quality of
lending work of the CF. was also evident in the modest rise in portfolio arrears
over this period, with non-performing assets (NPA)/total portfolio rising from
an average of 1.22 (1.3Z for PFIs) to 6.9Z (5.41 for PFIs)---it reached 381Z for
the banking system overall.
27.         By 1989, nearly all CFs had increased their capital substantially in
real terms, with the total nearly doubling. The debt:equity ratio fell steadily
to an average of 7.9 (7.4 for PFIs) and profits rose substantially above pre-
recession levels to an average of 45.62 of paid-in capital plus legal reserves
(47.8Z for PFIle). This was aided by a fall in NPA to an average of 0.5Z of total
portfolio at the end of 1989, with only 3 CF. having arrears which exceeded 3Z.
Overall, this was due to a combination of strong growth in aggregate demand
stemming from good macroeconomic management, deliberate efforts to increase
equity capital mobilization and work out NPA, and increases in financial margins
on the intermediation of longer-term capital. Those CFs acting as Project PFIs
also managed to perform better than the remainder of the financial system in
mobilizing certificates of deposit, as its share of total CDTs increased over
1985-89 from 7.0Z to 17.91 of this market. And by 1990, all 16 CF. had met the
eligibility criteria established by the Government in 1987 under Resolution 2041.
28.         Despite this impressive performance, certain problems remained at the
close of the Project. One such issue (also pertaining to the whole financial
sector) was the concentration of five CFs in development banking activity and the
difficulty of attracting new entrants into the longer-term market.  Despite
efforts to ease entry criteria under the DBP (Group B), only one new CF
(Progreso) joined the Project's PFIs (in Group A), the first new entrant since
the number of PIle increase from 5 to 8 in the early 1970s. A related problem
involved the ob1jectives and composition of the investment portfolio of the CFs,
which is higl.ly concentrated in related enterprises. A review of a sample of
investments suggests few cases of the provision of risk capital, support of new
enterprises or substantial turnover in holdings.  Individually, PIs committed
at least 601 of proceeds of the Bank's DBP loan to no more than three industrial
subsectors at the 3-digit International Standard Industrial Code level (Table
1.4).
1.7 Bank and BR Performance
29.         The Bank's performance was strongest in its ability to use the DBP
to establish or solidify fundamental sector policy and institutional changes
(variable interest rates and capital structure criteria). These changes have



- 9 -
proven to be central to the financial sector and sustainable.   The Bank'e
appraisal estimates of the character and results of the credit program itself
also proved to be quite accuarate, though its expectations were exaggerated about
the DBP's impact on technology, pollution control and equity financing.  Its
supervision of PFIs was appropriate and constructive. However, better project
preparation and supervision work could have been done with BR on its management
of the credit program in order to help correct some of the cumbersome procedures
which increased aubloan processing delays and costs.   Also, the technical
assistance program should have been better defined prior to loan negotiations if
it was indeed the priority reflected in loan documentation.
30.         As in prior projects, BR was diligent in implementing the agreed
credit regulations under the Bank's loan. It performed the credit allocation
function within the Project's rules in relatively neutral way and ensured
adherence to procurement, accounting and auditing and reporting requirements.
However, BR should have adopted for the DBP many of the measures employed in
later years (particularly since 1990) to decentralize ex ante work to PFIs and
concentrate more on the monitoring of PFI performance.  Higher free limits,
simplification of directed credit regulations and an increased ex post
orientation toward documents review would have permitted more attention to
activities more approrpriate to a second-tier organization such as monitoring the
financial performance of PFIs, early detection of potential repayment problems
and measurement of impact of different types of subprojects.   Performance
indicators also should have been more subproject- rather than enterprise-specific
for this purpose, to help enable BR to provide feedback to various policymakers.
1.8 Conclusions
31.         The DBP met most of its immediate objectives as foreseen in the
provision of longer-term credit to large scale Colombian industry, reinforcement
of financial sector reforms associated with CFs and enhancement of banking
supervisory capabilities.   The ex post analysis of a sample of subprojects
suggests that satisfactory returns were generally achieved from the investments
financed.   In addition,  the Bank's sector work underpinning the Project
contributed to broader financial sector reform steps which were taken in parallel
with Project implementation.
32.         The Project can bt judged as successfully contributing to industrial
and financial sector development in an environment of slow but progressive policy
and institutional change. In Colombia's highly trade protected environment of
the 1980s, it is most unlikely that the investments financed under the Project
configured enterprises to be internationally competitive.   As the sample
evaluation indicates, however, it is likely to have reduced the competitiveness
gap which firms must now overcome following the substantial acceleration of trade
reforms undertaken in Colombia in 1990. It also helped to create the basis for
the fundamental change in focus of the financial reform process, which was also
articulated in 1990, from improvements in prudential regulations and the
financial condition of institutions to increasing competitiveness and efficiency
of the sector.



- 10 -
33.         In this sense, the DBP was an important transitional forerunner to
the Bank's subsequent loan, approved in May 1991, to support industrial
restucturing and development. This operation helped to foster and is predicated
upon these broader reforms in both the real and financial sectors. It is now more
reasonable to expect that those investments undertaken and financed by this loan
will yield contributions sustainable in a relatively open international market
environment. The breadth of the current financial sector reform program also
offers real hope of reducing institutional concentration, which Bank credit line
projects up through the DBP implicitly supported  '/and  that longer-term
capital market mechanisms will develop.
3 / Under the Industrial Restructuring and Development Project loan, all
CPs and commercial banks meeting broad eligibility criteria can become PFIe.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
COLOMBIA
DEVELOPMENT BANKING PROJECT
(LOAN 2477-CO)
PART II: BORROWER REVIEW OF THE PROJECT
2.1 Introduction
1.          This ex post evaluation of the success of IBRD Development Banking
Project Loan No. 2477 first of all analyzes the characteristics of the line of
credit made available by the World Bank to Colombia, the types of project
financed, and the sectors to which financing was mostly directed.
2.          Subsequently, an examination is made of the chief measures which were
taken over the period 1985-1989, when the proceeds of the line of credit were
onlent, and which contributed to the improved performance of the development
banks ln conjunction with the higher levels of growth seen throughout the economy
in general.
3.          Finally, an assessment is given of the performance of the financial
intermediaries that participated in placing the proceeds of the line of credit
during the project period, comparing it with that of other financial institutions
which had no access to these funds.
2.2  Features of IBRD Development Bankina Prolect Loan 2477
4.          On November 27, 1984, the International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development and Colombia's Banco de la Repdblica, entered into a Loan Agreement
under which IBRD made its ninth line of credit, for US$90 million, available to
Colombia to be onlent through development banks for the financing of production
facilities and other investments in the manufacturing, tourism and mining sectors
that would contribute to the country's economic and social development.
5.          Under earlier IBRD lines of credit, the funds made available had been
earmarked for various purposes through use of a series of restrictions, which
proved to be obstacles to onlending of the funds rather than instruments that
promoted a deconcentration of investment. This being so, line of credit 2477 did
not call for specific allocations to different types of project, nor did it
prescribe requirements governing the size of beneficiary enterprises or interest
rate differentials as a means of fostering particular categories of project,
which had been the case previously.   Restrictions on asset levels were
eliminated, not only where access to the funds was concerned but also as regards
the conditions under which they would be made available (i.e. with or without
exchange risk).

6.          The loan ceiling per beneficiary was set at US$5 million over and
above balances outstanding under IDB line of credit 475-OC-CO, treated
cumulatively per beneficiary so as to preclude fragmentation of projects.
Initial sums of US$500,000 were made available in pesos for projects not
involving pollution control, technological improvements or equity investments;
since there was obviously a connection between the size of an enterprise and the
scale of its borrowing, availability of an initial US$500,000 in pesos tended to
favor small enterprises. The peso ceiling on projects to promote technological
Improvements, industrial pollution control and equity investments was set at US$2
million in view of the importance to Colombia of ventures of these types.
7.          The proceeds of IBRD-2477 were distributed almost evenly with and
without exchange risk. When the comparison is made against ordinary investment
projects and placement of the proceeds of IBRD-1857, the following facts become
apparent:
-     More projects have always been financed without than with exchange
risk. Although there had been a reduction under IBRD-1857 in the
number of those financed without exchange risk to 612, that figure
rose again under IBRD-2477 to 76Z.
-     In terms of value, projects with exchange risk, which had absorbed
612 of the proceeds of IBRD-1857, absorbed 512 under IBRD-2477.
-     Average subloan size was US$481-216 under IBRD-1857 and US$479,047
under IBRD-2477.
-     Average participation in project financing declined from 22.672
under IBRD-1857 to 17.672 under IBRD-2477.
8.          These figures show that industry, in order to lessen the effects of
exchange risk on investment finincing, was no longer resorting to the creation
of new enterprises as it had done when access to resources without exchange risk
was limited according to applicants' asset levels. However, there is evidence
that total demand for financing was cut back so that the credit ceilings beyond
which it became obligatory to assume exchange risk would not be exceeded.
9.          Generally  speaking,  IBRD-2477  funds were  channeled  into  the
formation, rehabilitation, expansion, modernization and improvement of
enterprises in the manufacturing, agroindustrial and mining sectors, construction
of storage facilities for perishable products, and laying of natural gas pipeline
networks. Projects to control industrial pollution (from plants in operation for
more than a year) were also financed, as were technological improvement projects
associated with R & D programs. Onlending terms were as follows:

Interest Rate                  Discount Rate
Peso Funds       DTF (Weekly index of CD       4 points below interest rate
interest rates) + 3 points
Dollar Funds     LIBOR + 2.5                  [3 points below interest rate
10.         It was initially anticipated that applications would be submitted to
the World Bank by December 31, 1986 and that the disbursement deadline would be
June 30, 1990.   However, these dates had to be changed:   the deadline for
submission of applications was extended to December 31, 1988 and the disbursement
deadline to August 30, 1990.  These changes were more a consequence of the
simultaneous  commitment  of IDB line of Credit  475  than of  difficulties
surrounding commitment and release of funds available under IBRD-2477.
il.         IBRD-2477 also had an advantageous effect on the finances of the
Banco de Is Repdbllca, since it was the first line of credit negotiated under the
currency basket system; this made it possible to achieve equitable distribution
among all borrowers of fluctuations in the exchange rates of the currencies
making up the basket, and also to facilitate the reimbursement process.
2.3  Times of Proloct Financed
12.         The total value of the line of credit was US$90 million.   Loan
applications to a value of US$92.2 million were approved, an amount subsequently
reduced to US$88.2 million because of cancellations, giving a net utilization
rate of 96Z.
13.         The proceeds of the line of credit were committed between November
1985 and May 1989. The year showing the highest approved value of subloans was
1986, also the year within that period when the economy grew at the highest rate
(GDP growth of 5.82) and also industry (with 5.9Z growth). The next year In
order of value of subloans approved was 1988, when GDP declined from the two
previous years to 4.2Z, a reflection of Colombia's lower coffee export quotas
under the International Coffee Agreement and the problems created by damage to
its crude oil pipeline system. The rest of the economy (excluding petroleum and
coffee, but including the coffee processing industry) grew by 5.21, a gain of 0.7
points over the previous year. The high volume of subloan approvals in 1988 may
also have been a result of the entry into force of Decree 2041 of 1987, which
gave impetus to the promotion of private development banks.
14.         In all, 195 subloans were financed, of which 190 (97.4Z) involved
ordinary investment projects, 49Z of them without exchange risk and 511 in dollar
funds.    Credits  for  investment  in  corporate  equities  and  technological
improvements/pollution control counted for only one and four approvals
respectively, which absorbed 1.31 of all funding approved.
15.         Those 195 subloans funded 150 projects, since 41 projects received
two subloans each, while two others received three each.   A total of 147
enterprises obtained financing, since three firms were granted two credits each,
while a fourth was granted three. On the basis of these figures, averages were



- 24 -
as follows:   each subloan amounted to US$473,087;  each project received
US$615,013; and each enterprise received US$627,564.
16.         The economic sector with the highest number of subprojects was
printing and publishing, followed by other plastic products, yarns and textiles,
and manufactured milk products. In terms of value of loans approved, printing
and publishing absorbed 11.742 of all funds available, chemical products (except
fertilizers) 11.47Z, yarns and textiles 9.11Z, and other plastic products 8.62Z.
17.         The proceeds of the line of credit went mainly to Bogota, Antioquia,
Valle del Cauca and Bolivar. As with other development resources, no significant
demand comes from enterprises not located in the principal cities, an indication
that the implied subsidy in long-term credit is not a sufficient incentive to
bring about changes in the regional distribution of production.
18.         Analysis of the distribution of IBRD-2477 funds by size of subloan
shows that 120 (or 61.52) of. the 195 subloans were for amounts below
Col$100 million, and that the bulk of the line of credit was concentrated in the
remaining 75 subloans, which absorbed 75.2% of the total resources available.
It is also clear that subloan size had no connection with the length of time the
sub-borrower enterprise had been in business; new enterprises were among the
group which took the largest subloans, just as well-established enterprises were
among those granted small subloans.
19.         Similarly, classification of subloans according to sub-borrowers'
asset levels shows that 95 of the 195 subloans (48.72) were made to enterprises
with total assets of less than Col$750 million, although they received only 29.2Z
of the proceeds of the line of credit, whereas the 17 largest enterprises (8.7Z)
received 23.1Z of these resources. It is also worthwhile noting that more new
enterprises were at the lower end of the scale, and that none of the enterprises
at the top of it -- those with investment plans involving more than
Col$4.5 billion -- were new.
20.         Of the 195 subloans, 23 (11.8Z) were made to new enterprises, which
received 14.7% of IBRD-2477. As to resources sought for ordinary investment, new
enterprises received 12.4Z of them without exchange risk and 11.1% with it.
21.         The proceeds of IBRD-2477 were onlent through eight financial
intermediaries. The three which made most subloans were C.F. del Valle, CF.
Colombiana and C.F. Nacional, for 28.6Z, 19.8% and 13.8Z of loan proceeds
respectively.   The proceeds of the line of credit were onlent through the
intermediary institutions to enterprises throughout the economy, without adding
to the degree of concentration in any one sector.
22.         The Bank's line of credit was 18.33Z of total cost of subprojects,
while sub-borrowers themselves put up 33.84%, other lines of development
financing were the source of 28.31Z, and other resources accounted for 19.52Z.
2.4 Intermediation of Resources
23.         Economic Climate and Retulations Governine DeveloDment Banks.  In
contrast to the first half of the 1980s, when the economy -- including the



- 25 -
financial sector -- went through a severe crisis, the second half saw not only
higher economic growth rates,.especially in 1986 and 1987, when they reached 5.8Z
and 5.3Z of CDP respectively, but also improved functioning of the financial
system. In 1989, productive activity again slowed down, as a result of: the
fall in the international price of coffee following the collapse of the
International Coffee Agreement in the middle of the year; disturbances in public
order; and the decline in commercial activity with Venezuela as a consequence of
policy measures adopted there.   This new slowdown in productive activity in
Colombia had an adverse effect on the indicators of activity in its financial
sector.
24.         As early as 1981, the financial sector itself began to face serious
problems, consequences of the recessive cycle through which the economy was
passing, its own exposure because of the high level of corporate debt, and the
degree of disequilibrium in the public sector manifested in fast growth in the
volume of unrecoverable debt and in the deleterious effects of this on financial
system liquidity, profits and capitalization.
25.         Efforts were made to counteract these difficulties by fostering
corporate and financial sector capitalization through such mechanisms as:
(a) the Corporate Capitalization Fund; (b) the Banking System Equal Access and
Capitalization Fund, later extended to include other financial intermediaries;
(c) minimum capitalization requirements for intermediaries as a pre-qualification
for access to certain lines of development credit; (d) preferential taxation
provisions associated with equity investments, especially in corporations with
stock ownership open to the public; and (e) capitalization requirements as a pre-
qualification for use of certain development financing facilities and special
lines of credit made available by the Banco de Is RepablIca.'
26.-        In the second half of the 1980s, a series of factors accounted for
a marked degree of recovery in the situation of the development banks, mainly as
regards their exposure levels, solvancy and earning power (Table No. 11). Among
those factors were:  the measures through which the crisis of the preceding
period had been managed; the ongoing control and supervision exercise by the
authorities through various legal and regulatory provisions (to be discussed
further on); and more efficient management of the financial institutions
themselves.
27.         The private developmeut banks, too, showed a degree of recovery, to
judge by their ratio of bad debts to total portfolio, which moved down from 6.36%
in 1985 to 1.14Z in 1988 -- a figure only slightly higher than that recorded in
1981, at the beginning of the crisis -- and then subsequently increased to 4.85Z
in 1989.
28.         The ratio of net worth to assets, one possible measure of development
bank solvency, rose from 11.512 in 1985 to 15.81 in 1989, an indication that these
entities grew by relying not only on their liabilities but also on their net
1~/   LXI Annual Management Report to the Board of Directors, Banco de la
Repabllca, Colombia, 1984.



- 26 -
worth. However, larger surpluses have added to net worth, although this is no
guarantee of the permanence of intermediaries' r'isources, as would be the case if
they had increased their capital. If the conventional debt ratio is used, that
of liabilities to capital, the degree of indebtedness appears greater, increasing
from Col$11.2 for each peso of capital to Col$19.8 over the same time period; this
means that more funds were lent on a narrower capital base, which can offset
losses in productivity over the short term or improve returns but signals less
capacity to cope with exposure.
29.         Rate of return, taken as the ratio of net profit to net worth, rose
from 0.982 in 1985 to 14.63Z in 1988, then falling slightly to 13.63Z in 1989.
30.         If performance efficiency means that payroll and administrative costs
decline in relation to volume of borrowing and lending operations, then it may be
concluded that the performance of the development banks improved, since these
costs represented 2.852 of liabilities and 2.52Z of assets in 1985 but 2.20Z and
2.122 respectively in 1989.
31.         Among the policy measures that tended to put the development banks on
a firmer financial footing, improving their solvency, earning power, liquidity,
portfolio quality and performance efficiency, the following may be mentioned:
32.         In 1985, the Financial Institutions Guarantee Fund was set up under
Law 117, to strengthen the capital position of Colombia's lending institutions.
In 1985, the Monetary Board issued Resolutions 52, 56 and 58, "with the twofold
objective of strengthening the productive sector and thereby favoring the
financial system through the power given by the Banco de Is Rep abllca of making
special loans to banking and financial institutions secured on their own
portfolios and on a prior requirement that separate agreements be entered into
between creditors and debtors, as a fundamental aspect of the campaign to improve
the financial position of corporations and of the financial sector itself."2 Also
in 1985, the Monetary Board issued Resolution 55, which modified the Corporate
Capitalization Fund.
33.         In 1986, a number of supplementary measures were instituted pursuant
to Law 117 -- for instance, Decrees 32 and 59 and Resolutions 2, 5 and 9 of the
Monetary Board, which specified what the functions and sources of revenue of the
Financial Institutions Guarantee Fund were to be, the general aim being to
eliminate the deficits of some financial institutions and attend to their solvency
problems. Throughout the period, regulations would continue to be issued pursuant
to Law 117, adapting the functions and resources of this Fund to changing
circumstances and regulating the loans granted to institutions: for instance,
Monetary Board Resolutions 104 of 1985, 7 of 1986, 17 of 1987 and 21 of 1988g
Decrees 2008 of 1986 and 2154 of 1989; and Decrees 2476 of 1986 and 1892 of 1989,
which introduced supplementary measures for the dismantling at a later date of
nationalized financial institutions.

34.         Decree 2041 of 1987 was the principal instrument for comprehensive
reform of the development banks. It was designed to "broaden the transformation
of short-term saving into long-term saving" and channel resources toward key
sectors of the economy; it reformulated the corporate purposes of the development
banks, making them specialists in channeling savings toward the productive sectors
for both the medium and long terms; their capital structure was also reinforced
through the prescription of minimum capital ceilings for them, introduction of
controls on their degree of indebtedness, and diversification of their activities
toward investment banking, factorii.g, provision of consulting services for
enterprises in the private sector, etc. -- all calculated to improve their earning
power.3  Subsequently, Decree 2039 of 1988 approved inclusion of the public
vehicular surface transportation subsector as one of the spheres for the
authorized activities of the development banks.
35.         Also noteworthy were Monetary Board Resolutions 58, 59, 60 and 61,
which  introduced  new  policies   on  reserve  requirements   for  financial
intermediaries, modifying ceilings and altering the formulas by which they were
computed. In addition, Board Resolutions 57 and 72 of 1987 allowed "negotiation
of the financial assets that constitute the legal reserves backing bank and
corporate CDs, development credit securities issued by commercial finance
companies (Resolution 57 of 1987), and agricultural development securities. In
this way, while meeting reserve and investment requirements through the initial
taking up of such securities, intermediaries may now negotiate them, thereby
increasing their earning power in line with prevailing borrowing and lending
rates."4 In its turn, this means sector entities bear less of a burden as far as
funding of the Fondos Flnancleros is concerned.
36.         In addition, through its Resolutions 24 and 25 the Monetary Board tied
the discountable portion of development credits to the weekly index of CD interest
rates (the DTF), thereby rendering obligatory investments more profitable, and
eliminated the subsidy represented by the difference between discount and
borrowing rates, tie aim being to preclude distortions in the financial market in
view of the cost which the transfer implicit in that subsidy cast on the economy
as a whole.
37.         In 1988, Resolution 3600 of the Superintendency of Banks came into
effect. This mandated adherence to uniform accounting standards, which allowed
more effective control of financial institutions when used in conjunction with the
program of financial alert indicators set up subsequently through ;he
Superintendency's Resolutions 2053 and 3535 of 1989.
38.         In 1989, Monetary Board Resolution 81 prescribed new measures for
regulating financial activity.   This instrument imposed limits on the asset
holdings of development banks, specifying that as of July 1, 1990 their risk-
weighted assets could not exceed 12 times their technical net worth. At the same
time, it redefined the concept of net worth and prescribed a new method for

- 28 -
controlling the degree of capitalization of the financial system, in view of the
fact that the conventional method of computing capital on the basis of liabilities
contributed to decapitalization of the system.
39.         Among the measures designed to encourage intermediaries to engage in
development credit operations must be counted Monetary Board Resolution 59 of
1989, which aimed at a link between interest rate and term of deposit that would
reflect the degree of maturity of the investment project concerned and also make
the capitalization of interest possible.
40.         In order to improve financial system competence and capitalization,
Decrees 1982 of 1989 and 500 of 1990 were issued pursuant to Law 74 of 1989
governing foreign investment in the financial sector.   The impact of these
Decrees, which regulate reprivatization of financial institutions, will make
itself felt' in the next few years.
41.         Finally, it may be noted that the recovery in the financial system was
accompanied by:  a monetary policy designed to reduce the burden of reserve
requirements on financial institutions through the utilization of open market
operations  to shrink the money supply; and a trend toward elimination of
obligatory investments. "This policy of unfreezing resources made intermediaries'
sources of funding more productive; it was applied not only to banks but also
development banks and savings and loan institutions. With the same end in view,
measures were also introduced to dismantle obligatory or reserve-substitute
investments as far as possible."5 Where interest rate management was concerned,
the policy attempted to "establish a stable climate which will allow general
application of flexible interest rates that can be adjusted to positive real
levels, approximating market conditio.;s in the case of directed credit.   In
practice, almost all directed credit interest rates today are tied to a market
indicator, the weekly index of CD interest rates (the DTF)."'
42.         Evolvement of DeveloDment Banks (1985-1990).  The intention here is
to examine the financial behavior of the development banks which took part in
onlending the proceeds of IBRD line of credit 2477 as compared with that of other
development banks.   The former will be referred to from here on as "IBRD
development banks" and the latter as "other development banks."
43.         As will be noted, an increase occurred over the subject period in the
mobilization of CDs (certificadoo de dep6sitos a t6rmino) by the development
banks, with higher annual growth rates being achieved by the IBRD development
banks, among which there was an average annual growth rate of 51.29Z from 1985 to
1989, compared to a 23.842 rate for other development banks.

and Their Application to the Case of Colombia," Revista del Banco de la
RopOblica, September 1990.
6/    Ibid.



- 29 -
44.         In the mobilization of funds throughout the financial system, the CDs
of private development banks absorbed a growing share of financial savings. This
increase can be ascribed to the management of the IBRD development banks, whose
CDs increased by comparison with those of the system as a whole from 6.97Z to
17.88Z between 1985 and 1989, while those of the other development banks declined
from 5.06Z to 4.98Z over the same period. The faster growth in CD mobilization
by the development banks observed in 1989 was a consequence of the entry into
effect of Decree 1734 of 1988, which set interest rates for the mobilization of
funds by development banks and commercial finance companies at levels up to 1.5
points annually higher than those set for banks; it was also a consequence of the
more aggressive marketing attitude of the former, reflected in borrowing rates
systematically higher than those offered by other lending institutions, given the
tax control measures in place, as occurred with banks and savings and loan
associations.7
45.         The financial solidity of the development banking group as a whole
declined over the 1985-1990 period. This is particularly true of the subgroup of
other development banks, where the initially high indicator fell by as much as six
points over the period, whereas there was a fall of only two points among the IBRD
development banks.
46.         The fact that this ratio was higher for the other development banks
reflects what appeared to be their greater financial solidity compared to the IBRD
group, since the latter showed fiscal year losses or accumulated losses which
reduced the size of their asset holdings, so that any component of them came to
represent a larger proportion of their total assets.
47.         The financial solidity of the IBRD development banks, however, was
based on the greater weight of their net worth, profits and appreciation in their
total assets throughout ths period by comparison with the other group.   For
instance, the average ratios of net worth, profits and appreciation to total
assets were 14.61S, 1.8Z and 6.41 for the IBRD group and 11.49Z, 2.17Z and -0.181
for the other group.
48.         The ratio of bad debts to total portfolio quality improved between
1985 and 1988 as the proportion of bad debts declined but then began to
deteriorate again in 1989, although without dropping to the levels that prevailed
at the beginning of the period (especially for the other development banks). This
improvement mirrored the fluctuations in the economic cycle, since in this period
there was not only a correction of the tendency toward overexposure but also an
improvement in the administrative management of lending institutions.
49.         Likewise, provision for portfolio losses, which represented over 1002
of profits in 1985 and 1986 for all development banks, essentially because of the
problems faced by the group of other development banks, declined to 10.212 in
1988, although it then rose to 13.62Z at the end of the period.

de la Repdblica, June 1989.



- 30 -
50.         For the IBRD development banks, the ratio of bad debts to total
portfolio was always lower than for the other group. The explanation for this is
that the IBRD group, as specialists in investment project financing, employed
trained staff to appraise loan applications, which cut the risk factor
considerably; they were also more demanding on the subject of what would
constitute satisfactory guarantees in the eyes of the World Bank and Banco de Is
Repdbl4ca.
51.         For  all  development  banks  throughout  the  pariod,  the various
indicators of earning power (net profit to capital plus reserves, gross spread,
gross spread plus earnings on investments, and operating results) improved
notably. The IBRD group, however, always performed better than the other group,
in the sense that their profits increased annually throughout the period at rates
higher than inflation, something which occurred with the other group only in 1988.
This can be ascribed to the types of activity pursued by the IBRD group, the
structure of the market, and their greater flexibility of action, financial
solidity, and ability to weather fluctuations in the productive cycle. This may
be seen in the ratio of net profits to capital plus reserves, where the IBRD group
always showed an index not only much higher than that of the other group but also
continually on the rise, even in 1989, when the initial signs of recession were
visible in the productive sector -- a change that inevitably affected the group
of other development banks, which had itself just begun to recuperate in 1988.
52.         As  to  gross  spread,  it  increased with  the  degree  of  control
intermediaries exercised over their resources.  Income and fees earned by all
development banks were supplemented by returns on investments, from which were met
such costs as fees payable, administrative and payroll expenses, and portfolio
protection, particularly over the first three years for the IBRD group and until
1988 for the others.
53.         "System  spread has  increased in real terms because of greater
financial productivity and a reduction (again in real ttrms) in the significance
of loss provisions. Moreover, as economic and financial activity has grown, in
conjunction with apparent improvements in system operating efficiency, the impact
of operating costs on total assets and on spread was reduced considerably from
1985 onward, with obvious repercussions on intermediaries' profits and greater
likelihood of a reduction in lending rates."$
2.5 Conclusions
54.         Given the complexities and continuous changes in the regulations
governing the two previous IBRD lines of credit, a particular feature of IBRD-2477
was that its simpler requirements made it much more flexible to implement, with
the result that placement of the funds took just three years, although IDB line
of credit 475 was being implemented at the same time.
55.         Some  147  enterprises  in the  industrial  sector benefitted  from
IBRD-2477, subloans being approved to a total value of US$92.2 million.   The

subsectors where there was most demand for funding were: printing and publishing;
other plastic productst yarns and textilest and manufacture of milk products.
56.         While the proceeds of the line of credit were being invested, from
1985 to 1989, both the development banks and the financial sector as a whole began
to recover from the crisis that had arisen in the early part of that decade; this
was the outcome of improved performance in the formal industrial sector, new
measures introduced by the monetary authorities, and the effort made to ensure
these measures were well administered.
57.         The development banks through which IBRD line of credit 2477 was
implemented, compared with the group made up of other private development banks,
have continued to perform better in terms of portfolio quality, capitalization and
earning power because of the impact of World Bank and Banco de 18 Repablica
programs on funding availability and continuing supervision of the activities of
the intermediaries themselves.
