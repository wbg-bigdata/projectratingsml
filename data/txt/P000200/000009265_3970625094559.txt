Description:  The proposed financing would be the first in a series to
support the Government's structural adjustment program.
The principal aim of the program is to redirect the
Burundian economy towards a development path which vill
reduce the present dependence on coffee and lay the basis
for sustained growth in the medium-term, with more
reliance on market forces and a more outward
orientation. The measures to be taken in this phase of
the program, as outlined in the Government's Letter of
Development Policy and supporting Sector Policy
Statements, fall into two main categories:
(a) At the macroeconomic level, the adjustment program
focusses on the development of a mediumrterm
framework, and includes rationalization of public
investment, improvement of public expenditure
management, import liberalization, credit reform,
and adoption of a flexible exchange rate policy.

ofh deir oficial duties. Its contenis may not otherwise be discosed without World Bank authorization.



- ii -
(b)  At the sectoral level, the program includes:  (i) an
agriculture sector action program designed to raise
output and improve the quality of export crops
through adequate incentives to farmers and
improvement in the existing processing and marketing
capacity; and a rationalization of sector
organization; (ii) a public enterprise sector reform
through restructuring, privatization where possible,
and closure if necessary, of key enterprises; and
(iii) trade and industrial reform aimed at improving
resource allocation, removing the bias against
exports, and promoting activities in which the
country has a comparative advantage.
The credits and loans would finance all imports with the
exception of items financed by other sources, military
and para-military items, alcoholic beverages, tobacco,
and precious metals or stones.
Estimated
Disbursements:  The proceeds of the proposed financing vould be
disbursed in two tranches. The first tranche of
US$25 million equivalent would be available for
disbursement upon credit effectiveness. Disbursement
of the second tranche of US$25 million would be
contingent upon the Government's taking the actions
exumerated in paragraph 102 of this report.  A
performance review would be held at end-1986.
Disbursements of the entire credit are expected to be
completed vithin 18 months after credit effectiveness.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
DEVELOPMENT CREDIT
AND AFRICAN FACILITY CREDIT TO
TUE REPUBLIC OF BURUNDI
FOR A FIRST STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT PROGRAH
1.        I submit the folloving report and recommendation on a
proposed development credit to the Republic of Burundi for
SDR 13.2 million (US$15 million equivalent) on standard IDA terms and a
proposed African Facility Credit of SDR 14.3 million (US$16.2 million
equivalent) from the Special Facility for Subsaharan Africa (the
African Facility), established by Resolution No. IDA 85-1 of May 21,
1985. In addition, I recommend that IDA would administer a proposed
Special Joint Financing non-reimbursable contribution of SwF 15 million
(about US$7.7 million equivalent) by Switzerland, and a proposed
Special Joint Financing nonrreimbursable contribution of
Yen 400 million (about US$2.2 million equivalent) from Japan. The
proposed financing aims at supporting the Government's program of
structural reforus designed to restore financial equilibrium and
achieve sustained growth.
2.        Part I of this report reviews the characteristics,
performance and constraints of the economy. Part II outlines the
Government's structural adjustment program, including the short-term
financial program. Part III describes in detail the actions to be
supported under the proposed Credit. Parts IV and V assess the
expected effects of the Government's structural adjustment program, and
describe IDA's role in the adjustment process, the proposed operation,
and other IDA operations in Burundi. Part VI provides a summary
account of the relations of Burundi with the IMF.
PART I - THE ECONONY
3.        The assessment of the Burundian economy in this report is
based largely on the work of two preparation missions (May and
September 1985) and the appraisal mission (November 1985) of the
proposed credit. The findings o' the 1983 economic mission are
reflected in the economic report (No. 4784-Eu) which vas distributed to
the Executive Directors on December 26, 1984. Country data are
provided in Annex I.
Background
4.        With a per capita income of US$240 (1984 Atlas), Burundi is
one of the poorest countries in the world. The country is landlocked,
small in size, and densely populated, vith no significant natural



resources other than relatively fertile agricultural land. Social
indicators compare vith those of the poorest African countries.
Population growth (2.9 percent per annum projected for the 1980-2000
period) is high. The society is mainly rural, as only about 5 percent
of the population live in the few urban centers. Despite the high
demographic pressure on already constrained land, migration to the
urban centers has been limited, urban growth having averaged about
5 percent a year. Although there are considerable regional differences
in income and large urban-rural disparities, there is little absolute
poverty in the sense that most people have access to basic shelter and
nutrition. School enrollment has expanded, but the auult literacy rate
remains low - about 30 percent.
5.       Agriculture is the dominant economic sector, contributing
60 percent of GDP and 85 percent of both employment and exports.
Burundi is one of the few African countries self-sufficient in food (at
least for the most popular staples). The industrial sector (including
energy and construction) accounts for about 15 percent of GDP and ouly
7 percent of exports. The private sector, while small in terme of
total fixed investment (15 percent), plays the major role in
agricultural production and trade. The public sector is important in
manufacturing, energy and infrastructure, and the parastatal sector
accounts for half of formal employment.  One obstacle to Burundi's
development is its landlocked situation, which makes the country
vulnerable to the transportation conditions of neighboring countries.
Although progress has been made in recent years to improve physical
facilities and to simplify transit formalities, transportation costs to
and from the Indian Ocean are very high. Passage through neighboring
countries is not reliably secure (as occurred recently because of civil
var in Uganda), and disruptions in transport can cause serious domestic
shortages and shortfalls in export revenues.
Macroeconomic Developments
6.        Following the accession of President Bagaza to power in 1976,
Burundi undervent a substantial economic change. Frost in Brazil in
that year caused world coffee prices to triple, and this development,
together with a substantial increase in foreign aid, contributed to a
considerable increase in public savings and accumulation of foreign
exchange reserves. During the second half of the '709, Burundi's
development strategy, as reflected in the Third Development Plan
(1978-82), vas based on achieving a high rate of growth and
diversifying the economy. The public sector took the leading role in
promoting productive activities and financing infrastructural
investments. The overall outcome vas largely positive. Despite the
decline in coffee prices, the rise in oil prices and the disrupting
effects of the Tanzania/Uganda var in the supply of essential importa,
real GDP growth averaged 6.7 percent per year between 1978-81,
investment rose to 13-14 percent of GDP (compared vith 8 percent in
earlier years), and manufacturing grev by 14.5 percent per year.
Transport infrastructure, particularly roads, expanded considerably,
leading to a road network vhich is basically adequate to the couutry's



- 3 -
present needs. Pover generating capacity increased from 6 MW to
11.6 MW. Social services, particularly coverage of education, vere
improved.
7.        Developments were not as positive in some other areas.
Following the decline of coffee prices and the doubling of oil prices
in the late '70s, the terms of trade deteriorated substantially
(45 percent between 1978-81), but the Government did not adjust to
these developments. A rapid increase in domestic demand and
expansionist fiscal and monetary policies led to a deterioration in the
balance of payments. The current account deficit increased from
5 percent of GDP in 1978 to 12 percent in 1982. Domestic savings fell
from 6.7 percent of GDP in 1978 to 2.6 percent in 1982. Until 1980,
part of the current account deficit vas financed Ly foreign aid.
Hovever, after 1980, the widening current account deficit was financed
largel; by a drawdown of foreign exchange reserves, which declined to
about 1.1 months of imports equivalent by end-1982. On the fiscal
front, the growth of expenditures (both recurrent and capitaL) outpaced
the growth of public revenues. The resulting deficits were financed by
credit from the Central Bank, foreign borrowing, and an accumulation of
domestic arrears.  The overall budget deficit rose froa  4.3 percent of
GDP in 1977 to 7.6 percent of GDP in 1981 and to 6.4 percent in 1982.
Inflation ran at a high 25 percent a year between 1977 and 1981,
leading to a rapid appreciation of the Burundi franc, which remained
pegged tO the U.S. dollar at the same rate as in 1978.  In the real
sector, manufacturing grev overprotected, oriented to thr. douestic
market, and heavily dependent on imports. Moreover, the overvalued
currency and the relatively high labor costs hindered expansion of
exports. Coffee remained therefore Burundi's major export commodity.

8.        The Fourth Development Plan (1983-87) vas prepared in 1982
when the budget and balance of payments were already under strain.
Nevertheless, the Plan incorporated an ambitious investment program of
US$230 million per year (US$100 million more than what had been
achieved during the Third Plan), of which 70 percent vas to be financed
by foreign aid and 30 percent by domestic resources, mainly from the
budget. Emphasis vas put on the development of agriculture through
large rural development projects and physical and administrative
infrastructure. To finance this program, the Government tried to
mobilize resources by several means. In 1983, the rates of main taxes
(e.g., transaction and beer taxes) vere increased between 50 and
100 percent, tax collection vas reinforced, transfers to public
enterprises vere cut drasticallv, and public vages vere frozen.
(Public employment continued to expand, however, and merit and
promotion increases vere granted.)  Moreover, to control the increasing
deficit in the balance of payments, the Government resorted to
administrative controls, including restrictions on imports and on
remittances of foreign exchange abroad. The profession of importer vas
regulated and price controls vere imposed upon imported and domestic
goods.
9.        Burundi's economic and financial performance in 1983 vas not
satisfactory. While 80 percent of planned investment was implemented,
this vas obtained at a high cost: public domestic debt increased by
32 percent; public external debt (outstanding and disbursed) reached
US$292 million, or ten times the 1977 level (reaching 24 percent of GDP
in 1983, compared with less than two percent in 1977); domestic arrears
accumulated, reaching 30 percent of Government spending at the end of
the year; and the overall budget deficit rose to 12.5 percent of GDP.
Moreover, the restrictions on imports had adverse effects on the
economy. Imports of consumer goods fell by about 33 percent and
imports of non-oil intermediate products declined by 9 percent,
hindering the activity of the modern sector. Administrative controls,
notably on imports and prices, led to a distorted price structure.
High rents accrued to monopolist importers, incentives to invest in
productive sectors vere diminished, and there vas a slowdown in the
economic activity. Non-coffee manufacturing stagnated and value added
in the tertiary sector declined in absolute terms. GDP grew by
2 percent mainly due to a good performance in the coffee sector. The
balance of payments' current account deficit remained above 12 percent
of GDP, and foraign exchange reserves remained at less than two months
of imports equivalent.
10.       At the end of 1983 the Government took some adjustment
measures: the Burundian franc vas pegged to the SDR, with an implicit
devaluation of 30 percent against the U.S. dollar; producer prices of
the main export crops vere increased between 6 and 50 percent; and
public wages remained frozen. The impact of these measures vas felt
mainly in the budget, whose revenues increased significantly due to
increased receipts from coffee and other exports. Hovever, continued
imports restrictions constrained capacity utilization in the modern
sector due to the lack of intermediate goods and favored the
development of parallel markets. In addition, climatic conditions vere



extremely adverse. A prolonged drought led to a reduction in
agricultural value added, contributing to a decline in real GDP of
4 percent in 1984. Inflation reached 14.4 percent.
11.       The economic situation improved in 1985.  According to
official estimates, GDP growth reached 6 percent, largely as a result
of the recovery of agricultural output and increased coffee production.
Coffee exports reached 32,000 tons (a 15 percent increase vith respect
to 1984) as Burundi's ICY quota vas raised. On the whole, exports of
goods and non-factor services reached US$130 million in 1985 as
compared vith US$112 million in 1984. This, together vith the increase
in public transfers associated with the 1984 drought, allowed an
increase in imports of intermediate goods and an expansion of
manufacturing output. The current account deficit is estimated to have
declined from 12.2 percent of GDP in 1984 to 10 percent in 1985. The
debt service ratio, however, reached 22 percent of exports of goods and
non-factor services, compared vith 14 percent lu 1984. On the public
finance front, revenues increased by 16 percent in nominal terma due to
higher revenues accruing from coffee and excise taxes. The growth of
public expenditures vas about 10 percent (for a domestic inflation of
less than 4 percent), leading to an improvement in the overall
budgetary deficit, which fell from 10 percent of GDP in 1984 to
8 percent in 1985. Recourse to domestic borrowing continued to be
important. Credit to the central Government continued to absorb the
largest part of the credit to the economy.
12.       The outlook for 1986 is marked by the unexpected increase
(about 50 percent) of world coffee prices in consequence of the
Brazilian drought. Burundi's coffee windfall in 1986 is estimated at
about US$44 million, equivalent to nearly one-third of previously
projected exports. This, together with the decline ln oil prices,
vill provide important relief to the country's balance of payments and
budget. The Government is avare, however, that this improvement i8
tumporary and it is committed to implementing a structural adjustment
program aimed at ensuring sustainable financial equilibria and economic
growth in the future.
Adjustment Policy Issues
13.       While the expected coffee windfall vill provide substantial
financial relief in the short-term, there remain two critical tasks
facing Burundi's economic managers. The first i to address the
underlying financial disequilibria by increasing mobilization of public
savings to finance public investment (hence reducing dependency on
domestic and external borroving) and by following prudent fiscal and
monetary policies to avoid inflationary pressures and difficulties in
the balance of payments. The second is to achieve longer-term
structural adjustuent of the economy by stimulating the productive
sectors and private investment, lessening dependence on coffee, and
developing a wider resource base. With regard to the short term, the
measures included in the Governuent's financals program (to be
supported by the IMF) will help the country to reach more sustainable
financial equilibria on both the external and domestic fronts.



- 6 -
14.       To resolve the structural issues, a comprehensive and
consistent package of measures is needed to: (i) strengthen
macroeconomic management, including through appropriate exchange rate
and credit policies, fiscal reform, and prudent foreign borroving;
(ii) control aggregate demand thror:gh prudent monetary, fiscal and vage
policies; (iii) improve efficiency in the use of public sector
rzsources, including through proper planning and effective
implementation of public investment/expenditure programs and
rehabilitation of the public enterprise sector; (iv) rationalize and
increase incentives for export growth and efficient import
substitution, including the adoption of adequate industrial incentives,
a tariff-based trade policy and pricing policies conducive to growth of
the agricultural export crops; and (v) increase private and public
savings through steps such as raising interest rates and improving tax
collection.  These policy areas form the basis of the Governnent's
program to be supported by the IMF and by the proposed Structural
Adjustment Credit (SAC).
Prospects and Needs for Financing
15.       While progress has taken place in non-traditional exports,
notably of manufactured goods, the bulk of foreign exchange earnings
vill continue to come from coffee in the next ten years, making the
economy vulnerable to volatility in the vorld coffee market and
rendering macroeconomic management quite difficult. To accelerate
economic growth and maintain financial equilibrium, major structural
changes are needed in order to lessen the economic dependency on
coffee. The volume of coffee exports is presently affected by the fall
in coffee production in Brazil. As coffee quotas established by the
International Coffee Agreement have been lifted until 1987, Burundi is
likely to export all its coffee production, projected at 34,000 tons in
1986 and 35,200 tons in 1987. It is expected that Burundi vill
subsequently be able to negotiate a ouota level compatible with its
production capacity, presently projected to grow at about 4 percent per
year. However, given the expected future decline in coffee prices
(prices are projected to fall by 14 percent in 1987 from their expected
1986 level and to remain at the same level until 1990), the export
revenues accruing from coffee vill decline despite increases in the
volume exported. To offset in part the effects of coffee price
oscillations, Burundi needs to improve the quality, value added, and
marketing of its coffee.
16.       Burundi's external borroving requirements for 1986 and 1987
have been reduced by the expected coffee windfall, estimated at
US$44 million and US$14 million respectively (33 and 6 percent of
exports respectively) and by the fall in oil prices (equivalent to
US$6 million in 1986).   Hovever, the need to pay increased debt
service, the requirements of major development projects, the demand of
the modern sector for essential imports of raw materials and spare
parts, the volatility of coffee prices, and the need to build foreign
exchange reserves (which have fallen to 1.2 months of import equivalent
in 1985), will require the implemertation of prudent policies in terms
of domestic demand and monetary and fiscal policies. The Government's



- 7 -
objective is to use the coffee windfall to accumulate reserves,
securing a comfortable coverage of about 3-1/2 to 4 months of imports,
in 1986 and 1987, and maintaining it at above 3 months in the medium
and long term. This is a sensible objective, in view of the country's
landlocked situation and its dependency on coffee exporta. Under
conservative assumptions with respect to imports, external capital
requirements to allow the country to build that level of reserves
amount to about US$335 million during the 1986-87 period, of which
US$160 million are expected to be financed by concessionary aid already
committed, US$90 million from capital grants, and the remaining
US$85 million would come from the proposed financing package and other
donors' programs. This is consistent with the public investment
program as agreed with the Government. The debt service ratio, which
more than doubled from 10 percent in 1983 to 22 percent in 1985 is
expected to be 17 percent in 1986 and 20 percent in 1987, declining
steadily aftervards. While Burundi has an important debt problem,
especially taking into account the dependency of its exports on a
single coumodity, the country remains creditworthy for long-term
borrowing, provided sound economic policies are pursued by the
Governuent. Given the concessionary terma of Burundi's debt
(2.7 percent average interest rate, 31 years of maturity and a grant
element of 56 percent), there is no reason to consider advance
repayment of outstanding debt. In the context of the proposed program,
the Goverament is committed, however, to borrow only at concessionary
teras.
PART Il - THE GOVERN~HENT S STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT PROGRAM
A. Need for Structural Change
17.       As noted above, Burumdi's rapid economic growth in the second
half of the 1970s (6.5 percent per year) was in large part the result
cf the boom in coffee prices in the mid-1970s and the consequent
accumulation of public savings, which in turn, allowed a considerable
expansion of public investment and growth in related sectors. At the
turn of the decade, the Goverament failed to adjust to the changing
environment, characterized by a deterioration of the terms of trade and
increasing pressure over the balance of payments. An expansionary
policy, together with administrative controls, led to serious financial
disequilibria, a slow-down in economic growth (1.4 percent per year
between 1982 and 1985) and important economic distortions. The main
objectives of the Government's structural adjustment program are to
diversify the economy and lay the basis for a sustained growth in the
medium term based on the country's comparative advantages and relying
on the private sector. Diversifying the economy will be a difficult
task since coffee accounts for 10 percent of the GDP, 85 percent of
export earnings, and about 25 percent of government revenues; moreover,
much of the service sector, and some manufacturing activities, depend,
directly and indirectly, on incomes generated by coffee. However, the
need for diversification is pressing. While the windfall expected from
the recent increase in coffee prices will allow some real increase in



- 8 -
imports and in growth, the coffee prospects for the long run indicate
depressed demand and prices. Moreover, the fluctuations of coffee
prices affect both public revenues and export revenues making the
economy difficult to manage.
18.       The achievement of the structural adjustment will require a
long-term effort, as it represents fundamental changes in attitudes,
institutions, and policies. Even if appropriate policies begin to be
applied immediately, it would be unrealistic to expect the initial
adjustment process to take less than a decade. During this period
Burundi will lay the foundation for an economy where both agriculture
and industry are provided incentives sufficient to permit sustained
export growth. A significant shift should progressively occur towards
greater private investment and production activities relative to public
sector investment and production, and a more efficient public sector
should begin to emerge vith more reliance on decentralized
decision-making than upon direct controls. Investments in
infrastructure and the social sectors will be designed to support
efficient growth in the productive sectors and other development
objectives. Finally, the capacity for bringing about future needed
structural changes will be strengthened by establishing appropriate
policies and institutional mechanisms. The Government recognizes that
while the adjustment process will involve some short-term hardship, it
vill contribute significantly to improvements in the standards of
living of the population over the medium term.
19.       To accomplish this, even over an extended period, will not be
easy. The achievement of other objectives fundamental for sustained
economic growth, such as a decline in population growth (a program to
vhich the Government is now fully committed), vill take even longer.
In the initial period, priority should be given to reinvigorating the
productive sectors, promoting private investuent, and P:rengthening
Burundi's institutional capacity to effect the process of structural
change. The effects of the initial adjustuent vary across sectors.
The industrial sector probably will be the first to react. Inefficient
enterprises which have grown up protected by an inappropriate tariff
structure and an overvalued exchange rate will have to adapt to the new
system of increased competition; industries based on domestic raw
materials and intermediate goods will assume greater importance
compared to those based on imported materials and components; and new
technologies will be more labor intensive than in the past. The
Government's financial adjustment program includes control of public
wages, which will help to reduce the relative costs of labor (compared
to the cost of capital), promote employment, and increase the
competitiveness of Burundi's goods abroad. Agriculture vill respond
initially through better performance of export crops (due to improved
incentives). The foodcrops sector will benefit from the increase in
revenues accruing fron higher prices for export crops as vell as from
the reinforcement of support activities and application of improved
technologies. Building an institutional capacity to deal with
structural change vill require better mechanisus to deal with
fluctuations of export earnings, and to implement flexible exchange
rates and other pricing policies.



20.       Bank support for structural adjustment.  A meaningful
adjustment program vill need close support from both the Bank and the
Fund. Fund support is proposed initially for the implementation of a
stabilization program to cover the period mid-1986/end-1987. Bank
support is proposed to be extended through several Bank interventions
including: (i) a series of structural adjustment credits; (ii)
technical assisttnce credits aimed at strengthening general
economic management in the ministries of Planning, Finance and some
line ministries and to support the rehabilitation program of the public
enterprise sector; (iii) strengthening of technical assistance
components of future Bank projects in agriculture and other sectors to
focus on the structural adjustment needs of these sectors; and
(iv) financing of consultants' studies under the Third and Fourth
Technical Assistance projects and other IDA-financed projects.
21.       The period 1986-87 covered by the first SAC vould be used to
p:t in place the new incentive structure and strengthen the
institutional capacity needed for improved public expenditure planning
and control as vell as other reforms. An exchange rate policy, agreed
vith the INF, 6nd a new tariff structure would be put in place to
provide appropriate incentives to both agriculture and industry. The
public enterprise sector vould be rehabilitated, vith closure of some
enterprises, and partial or total privatization of others. The size
and composition of the 1986-88 public investment program has already
been determined as a function of resource availabilities and
development priorities within a three-year financial framework. The
private sector would be given the signal that the public sector
investment is to be supportive in nature and will not preempt resources
avay from the private sector.  The institutional framevork in support
of agricultural development will be strengthened.
22.       As the structural adjustment process does not encompass all
of Burundi's development problems, it is important that the Bank
support other projects to complement the SAL program, and to address
important problems not dealt with under the SAL. For example, in
agriculture we propose to help strengthen and develop agricultural
research, as well as the central services through an agricultural
services project. Bank vork in other related areas is also proceeding:
urban sites and services, expanding vater supplies in rural areas,
vocational teacher training and manpower development in agriculture as
vell as technical assistance components in a number of sectors. 1/
Moreover, Bank support vill be needed for the Government's structural
adjustment program even after the period covered by the first SAL.
Some of this support vill consist of folloving up on actions initiated
under SAL I. Other areas will also be addressed, notably regarding
management of the public sector (aiming at revieving organization and
vage structure), employment generation, and preparation of the Fifth
Development Plan (1988-92).

B. The Government's Short-Term Financial Program, 1986-87
23.       The Governnent's short-term financial program has been
discussed vith the IMF in close coordination vith the Bank. The
program encompasses important areas of policy which are addressed
under the proposed SAL.  The financial program includes policy actions
in the folloving areas:
(a) External payments. The program aims at reducing the deficit
in the balance of payments' current account, and at building
up foreign exchange reserves while limiting debt service to a
reasonable proportion of exports;
(b) Budgetary and monetary policies. The objectives are to reduce
the past level of Government's domestic borroving to finance
the budget deficit and allow expansion of credit to the
private sector, increase the level of public savings to
finance the public investment program, avoid inflationary
pressures, and contain domestic demand; and
(c)  Credit policies.  The program's objectives are to improve
incentives for private savings, and orient credit to
productive sectors.
24.       External payments.  The objectives of the government program
are to limit the deficit of the current account of the balance of
payments to a level wbich vill allow:  (a) a decline, in the long term,
in the ratio of external debt vith respect to GDP and that of debt
service vith respect to export revenues as needed to maintain the
country's creditworthiness; (b) rapid improvement in the balance of
payments and consequently in net official foreign exchange reserves;
and (c) relaxation of controls over imports and transfers of foreign
exchange vith the objective of encouraging foreign investment and
avoiding expansion of the parallel market for goods and foreign
exchange. The Government vill rely on an appropriate exchange rate
policy and prudent monetary and fiscal policies to control demand for
imports, and direct controls over imports vill be progressively
eliminated (para. 60).
25.       The financial program for 1986-87 assumes that the average
international coffee price vill reach US$4.70/kg in 1986, decline to
US$4.05 in 1987, and remain there in nominal terms until 1990 (as
projected by the Bank) and that the average export prices for Burundi's
coffee vill follow the same pattern.  This vould imply coffee exports
of US$140 million in 1986 and US$126 million in 1987, compared to the
projections before the price increase of US$97 million and
US$112 million, respectively. The stabilization program is geared to
achieving the objective of accumulating foreign exchange reserves to a
level of at least 3 months of imports (compared vith 1.2 months in
1985). The Government's adjustment program therefore aims at adjusting
imports and economic activity tO levels compatible vith prospective
developments in the vorld coffee market and vith resources available
from Burundi's own foreign exchange earnings plus foreign aid



- il -
contributions. Assuming a conservative evolution of imports, the
current account gap is expected to average US$105 million in 1986 and
1987 (Table 2).  Net inflows from the existing pipeline are estimated
to average US$55 million a year during 1986-87 and Bank non-project
lending (including African Facility Fund) is expected to provide about
US$25 million per year, the remaining coming from project lending
commitments from the World Bank and other major donors. Assuming that
the major donors endorse the program and maintain their aid levels in
constant terms (about US$70 million a year), Burundi could accumulate
foreign exchange reserves to about 3-1/2 to 4 months of import
equivalent during this period.  The debt service ratio vould fall from
22 percent in 1985 to 20 percent in 1987. The ratio vould
progressively decline aftervards as the result of Government's
commitment to borrow only at concessionary terms and as debt contracted
at near-commercial terms is paid off.
26.       The management and follow-up of external debt vill be
strengthened, and the Government vill create an interministerial
coumittee vith representatives of the External Debt Service in the
Ninistry of Finance, the Bank of the Republic of Burundi, and the
Ministry of Planning. This committee vill be established before
June 1986, and will be responsible for the management of the public
external debt, including that of the Central Government and Public
Enterprises, and vill ensure that future commitments will be only on
concessionary terms. The Bank vould provide technical assistance to
the Governmeut in this area under a proposed Fourth Technical
Assistance project.
27.       The incentive policies to be adopted by the Government
include an initial exchange rate adjustment agreed vith the IMF, and
followed by an additional adjustment over a ten-month period, and the
simultaneous adoption of a flexible exchange rate policy vith a
commitment to maintain the real effective exchange rate. A major
change in trade policies (see paras. 54-60) vill take place as vell. A
revised tariff schedule (developed by the Government with Bank
assistance) to effect a more efficient and equitable structure of
protection ,il be adopted simultaneously vith the exchange rate
reform. The trade reform includes reductions in the number of tariff
rates and their range, a reduction in custom duties exemptions (granted
at present under the Investment Code), and a replacement of
quantitative restrictions by tariff duties. These measures will have
the effect of increasing competition among importers, and it is
estimated that the proposed trade reform vill lower the level of
protection (measured by the decline in domestic prices of lmported
goods after liberalization) by about 25 percent. The proposed
devaluation together with the Government's budgetary and monetary
policies (para. 28) would restrain import growth and pressure on the
balance of payments.

28.       Fiscal and monetary policies.  The Governuent intends to
pursue a prudent budgetary and monetary policy during 1986-87 aimed at
increasing public savings, controlling inflationary pressures, and
providing incentives to efficient allocation of resources available for
investment. The program includes the following elements:
(a)  Measures to rationalize the fiscal system and increase its
revenue potential including: (i) reform of the transaction
tax; (ii) trade reform as described below; (iii) reform of
all consumption taxes from specific to ad valorem basis;
(iv) reduction in the customs duty exemptions granted to
selected imports; (v) strengthening of the collection and
auditing system; and (vi) review of exemptions granted under



- 13 -
the Investment Code. These measures, together vith the
expected effects of the increase in coffee prices and the
devaluation, are projected to raise public revenues in 1986
by 49 percent in nominal terms and keep them at the same
level in 1987.
(b) A prudent monetary polfcy vill be adopted aimed at keeping
annual inflation at 10 percent in 1986 and 9 percent in 1987,
while providing incentives to private savings and to
investment in projects of assured economic justification. To
achieve this objective, in the context of a policy of trade
and foreign exchange liberalization, the Governuent vill:
(i) increase the interest rates on one-year deposits by five
percentage points (from 7 to 12 percent). The other interest
rates will be adjusted accordingly; and (ii) taking into
account the program's objectives of increasing the level of
net foreign exchange reserves in 1986, and the important
acceleration of monetary expansion in 1985, the Government
will endeavour to reduce credit expansion in 1986. This
objective vill be achieved by reducing net credit to the
Government by 36 percent, while expanding credit to the
private sector by about 12 percent. These objectives are
compatible with a reduction in the budgetary deficit from
FBu 11.2 billion in 1985 to FBu 2.4 billion in 1986 and FBu
4.1 billion in 1987. Taking into account the expected level
cf foreign resources available to the budget, the Government
vill be in a position to repay FBu 5 billion of its domestic
debt in 1986 and 1987.
(c) Restrictive public expenditures policy including (i) an
average annual increase of 7.9 percent in personnel
expenditures and of 6.5 percent in transfers and recurrent
subsidies (including scholarships); (ii) a 12 percent
increase in non-wage operating expenses; (iii) payment of
domestic arrears; and (iv) limit of the public investment to
FBu 20.1 billion in 1986 (of which, FBu 1 billion vould be
financed by extra-budgetary sources) and FBu 22.0 billion in
1987, which is compatible with the expected foreign aid
available in these years (FBu 16.1 billion and
FBu 19.6 billion, respectively), and vith the expected
availability of budget resources to pay the local
counterpart.

PART III - THE SAL PROGRAM 1986-88
29.       The Structural Adjustment Program which the SAL would
support, covers the period mid-1986 to end-1987. The program is
outlined in the Government's Letter of Development Policy and attached
timetable for action (Annex IV) and covers five main areas: (a) public
expenditures policy; (b) public enterprises policy; (c) agriculture
sector policies; (d) trade and industrial sector policies; and
(e) credit allocation. The structural adjustment program would be
implemented by the various government departments and agencies involved
in the reform process and coordinated by the Ministry of Planning. A
proposed Fourth Technical Assistance Project, to be appraised in
September 1986, would be specifically designed. to assist in the
implementation of programs initiated under the SAL. Support necessary



- 15 -
before the effectiveness of the Fourth Technical Assistance Credit
would be financed from the ongoing Third Technical Assistance Credit,
or under a Project Preparation Facility Advance for the Fourth
Technical Assistance Credit.
A. Public Expenditures Policies
30.       The public expenditures policies covered by the program
include those affecting:  (i) the public investment program;
(ii) budgetary reform; and (iii) strengthening of the institutional
capacity.
31.       Public Investment Program.  The Fourth Development Plan
(1983-87) provided for investments of about FBu 129 billion (in 1984
constant prices) or about FBu 26 billion per annum, over an estimated
460 projects; of the total expenditures, about half would be for 27
large projects. During the 1983-85 period, actual spending was lover
than what had been planned: FBu 19.2 billion in 1983, FBu 17.4 billion
in 1984 and FBu 18.4 billion in 1985 (in constant 1984 prices).
Initially, a sum of FBu 24 million had been planned for the years 1986
and 1987 to keep the momentum of the investment plan and reach at least
70 percent of the plan target. It is nov clear that Burundi cannot
undertake these levels of investment, as the needs for domestie
financing would be excessive compared to the requirements for
stabilization of the economy. In fact, the targets of capital
expenditures which are compatible vith the overall program are about
70 percent of these levels, i.e., an average of EBu 17 billion (in
constant 1984 prices) for the two years. The Coverament has therefore
decided to eut back the investment program in an economic manner,
maintaining the aliocations to the major sectors, notably agriculture
(30 percent of the total investment). The completion of ongoing viable
projects and the beginning of high priority projects took precedence in
the exercise.
32.       In the context of preparation for the SAL, the Governument has
reviewed the overall PIP and put apecial emphasis on the 1986 program
to ensure that this vas compatible with the resources available and the
stabilization requirements. Some lesser priority projects vere dropped
completely, notably a ferryboat project, a second severage project in
Bujumbura, three industrial projects to produce cement, malt and
bricks, a large project to invest in port storage, and six projects to
improve administrative infrastructure (including two government
residences and some regional administrative offices).
33.       The revised program for 1986-88 comprises 123 projects, 50 of
which are in the agricultural sector. The average size of the projects
are small. Only 33 projects are larger than US$3 million
(FBu 350 million), accounting for 75 percent of the investment
program. These projects have been reviewed by the Bank, and their
economic justification has been found adequate, except for the SOSUMO
sugar project (para. 34). The program is to be financed by
concessionary aid (85 percent of total investment) and by the
government budget.



- 16 -
34.       The SOSUMO sugar project (US$60 million) consists of a
plantation of 1,400 ha of sugar cane and a sugar plant vith a
production capacity of 14,000 tons of sugar a year. The project
represents about 15 percent of the total public investment program over
the period 1986-88. It was appraised in 1981 by the African
Development Bank, and is cofinanced by the AfDB, OPEC, BADEA, the
Abu Dhabi Fund, Belgium and Germany.  The terms of financing are very
favorable (3 percent average interest rate and 15 years of average
maturity). At the time of project appraisal in 1981, the economic rate
of return was estimated at 14 percent. In the context of Its economic
and sector work, the Bank expressed reservations about the assumptions
on which this rate vas based, in particular the level of domestic
demand for sugar, and questioned the priority of the investment.  Since
then, the price of sugar declined subtantially (from US$0.37/kg in 1981
to US$0.09/kg in 1985). A review of the project in 1985 by a Bank
consultant showed a marginal positive ERR on the basis of still
optimistic assumptions with respect to sugar demand. The Governument of
Burundi, however, gives high priority to the project, which is to
contribute to the development of the Mosso province, a remote and
underpopulated region. At the time of appraisal of the proposed
structural adjustment program, contracts had already been signed and
penalty costs in the event of cancellation would have been high. An
understanding vas reached, therefore, by which the Government agreed:
(a) not to enter into any new commitment vith respect to the project
until it has carried out a detailed analysis of the proposed investment
and until the Government has consulted the Association; (b) to contract
vith a reputable management firm, vith terms of reference and
qualifications acceptable to IDA, taking into account existing
requirements of other donors, for the management of the plantation and
of the factory; (c) that the full cost of production should be borne by
the consumer and that there should be no operating subsidies to the
sugar project from the budget; and (d) to ensure that SOSUMO will be
audited annually by an independent and reputable firm with terms of
reference and qualifications acceptable to the Association, and that
the audit will be submitted to IDA for review and comments vithin six
months of the end of each fiscal year. These understandings have been
included in the Statement of Development Polic4es (Annex IV) and in the
Development Credit Agreement. A Bank mission will assess whether the
distillery component is justified despite the recent decline in
petroleum prices, and whether this component would improve the economic
justification of the project.
35.       As of now, the project pipeline for 1987 and 1988 could be
increased taking into account the expected resource availability.
However, the Goverument intends to decide on the allocation of
available resources between capital and recurrent expenditures in the
context of an overall public expenditures program. Moreover, the
Government will identify developient projects vhich fit the
Government's sectoral priorities and have an adequate economic
justification. The preparation of the PIPs in 1987 and 1988 will be
carried out in the context of a three-year public expenditures progranm.

ai  Includes non-budgetary resources such as local contributions.
36.       Budgetary reform.  The present one-year budget system has two
components: the ordinary budget (BO) and the extraordinary budget
(BEI). The bulk of tax and non-tax revenues goes to the BO to finance
recurrent expenditures and repayment of public debt. The BEI is
allocated special taxes from coffee and beer, dividends accruing to the
Government and an annual amount of Central Bank financing
(FBu 2 billion) included in the BEI as regular annual revenue. The BEI
finances mostly capital expenditures (including counterpart funds for
projects financed by foreign aid) and non-capital iteus, such as
contributions to regional organizations. Investment expenditures
financed by foreign aid are not shown in either budget.  Each budget is
separately discussed and approved by the Council of Ministers; deficit
financing is also individualized, leading to a complex structure of
public domestic debt.
37.       The present system has serious drawbacks for an efficient
public expenditures management: the arbitrary allocation of revenues
between budgets, the inclusion of bank financing as revenue, and the
failure to include foreign-financed expenditures distort the public
finance picture, making it difficult for the Government to obtain a
global view of its expenditure program, to progran investment
expenditures as a function of public savings, and to adjust the
expenditure program to fluctuations of revenues.
38.       To make the budget an efficient tool of macro-economic
management, the Covernment intends to implement the folloving reforns
in the context of the SAL:
(a) Adoption of a unified system of budget preparation vith a
clear identification and separation of current revenues,



- 18 -
current expenditures (excluding repayments of debt), and
capital expenditures financed both by the budget and foreign
aid;
(b) Preparation of a comprehensive three-year public expenditures
program (PEP) which vill include for each executing agency
recurrent and capital expenditures. This would permit a
better planning of resources to finance central
administration expenditures, social services, maintenance of
fixed assets, and recurrent expenditures associated with
on-going and new investment projects.  The annual budget to
be presented to the National Assembly would correspond to the
first year of the three-year budget;
(c) Identification vithin the public investuent program of a
core" program of projects of highest priority for which full
funding would be assured. A non-core (stand-by) program
would be prepared simultaneously; this would be financed if
additional resources became available. The core projects
would be those with the highest rates of return (whenever
these can be computed) and according to the criteria defined
by the Government and its development priorities in terms of
inter-sectorial allocation. All projects above US$3 million
would be subject to feasibility studies (prepared by the
Government or donors) according to guidelines provided by the
Government. The feasibility analysis would be discussed with
the technical ministries to ensure that the Government's
priorities and criteria are taken into account; and
(d) Consideration of the following aspects while establishing the
investment program: (i) it must be compatible with the
objectives set for the debt service; (ii) it should require
minimal domestic bank credit; and (iii) its foreign currency
part should be financed through grants or concessionary
oans.
39.       Institutional capacity.  To support the implementation of
these reforms, there is a need to reinforce existing institutional
capacity at several levels. In the Ministry of Finance, the services
responsible for preparing the annual budget vould be strengthened to
improve the public accounting system (namely by adopting a double-entry
accounting system) and trained to prepare a three-year public
expenditure program and a unified budgetary framework before the
ordinary and extraordinary budgets are presented to the National
Assembly. The Government will receive technical assistance from IDA to
prepare the three-year PEP, with financing under the Third Technical
Assistance Project, and from the INF on public finance accounting.
40.       At the level of the planning structure, the Government has
recruited a consultant for two years to help establish a system to
monitor project implementation. With respect to project preparation
and appraisal, there is also a need for ir.stitutional strengthening.



- 19 -
At present, the largest investment projects have been appraised by
foreign donors and consultants often using differing criteria and
country parameters. The Government vishes to follov more closely the
preparatory vork of large projects as vell as to enhance the capacity
of its technical ministries to carry out appraisal work for smaller
projects. In this process, common criteria and guidelines vill be
used, including those of standard coot/benefit analysis (whenever
possible) and relevant parameters which have been developed to reflect
the specific conditions of the country. These guidelines (described in
detail in the Policy Statement on Management of Public Expenditures,
Annex VIII) will be used by all ministries in preparing and appralsing
projects to be submitted for financing. To implement this reform, the
Government will create a project preparation unit in the Ministry of
Planning with satellite units in the major technical ministries. The
planning unit of the Ministry of Agriculture vill be reinforced and new
units will be created in the ministries of Commerce and Industry,
Transportation, Education and Health. Under the Fourth Technical
Assistance Project, the Government would hire an expert on project
preparation and appraisal for two years to assist the project unit of
the Ministry of Planning and its satellites in technical ministries.
B. Public Enterprises
41.       The Government of Burundi owns and operates about sixty
public enterprises (PEs) which are engaged in a vide variety of
commercial and social activities. This sector grev rapidly during the
Third Development Plan period (1978-81) to play different roles,
notably as provider of public services, to compensate for the lack of
private investment (especially in industry) and to co-ordinate economic
sectors notably export crops. The role of the PE sector in the economy
is considerable, accounting for about half of the formal employment and
the same proportion of industrial value added.
42.       In the early 1980s, the Government channelled considerable
financial resources to these enterprises, but the parastatal sector as
a whole did not perform satisfactorily, with many enterprises operating
at a low capacity, incurring substantial operating losses, unable to
contribute to their own investment program or to service their debt.
The Government has felt since 1982 that the tight public finance
situation did not permit the continuation of financial support to these
enterprises, and transfers vere severely cut. Today, the burden of
these enterprises in the government budget is therefore much smaller
than in the past. Their impact on the economy remains hindered,
however, by their poor economic performance and management. A recent
study has shown that in 1984, four of these enterprises were on the
verge of bankruptcy, fifteen had suffered substantial losses, twelve
had negative cash flows and four had negative equity.
43.       The poor financial performance of these enterprises steias
from several sources, including their unclear relations with the
relevant ministries in decision making, lack of adequate management
capacity, and excessive government coutrol over investment and pricing



- 20 -
decisions. Some enterprises also suffer from inadequate capital
structures. The Government has recognized the need to include the
parastatal sector in the current structural adjustment program. The
Bank has provided assistance for the diagnosis and preparation of a
rehabilitation program for the sector, initially during the preparation
for the Third Technical Assistance Credit and lately under the SPPF for
the proposed SAL.
44.       The Policy Statement on the Public Enterprise Sector
(Annex V) states the Government's main objectives for the sector:
(a) to ensure that government participation vill be limited to those
cases which require public investment either because they are vital
public services, or because strategic sectors are involved; and (b) to
maximize the contribution of viable public enterprises to GDP by
ensuring that they operate efficiently. This will be accomplished by
providing a sound financial structure and more managerial autonomy to
the enterprises and by ensuring that all commercial PEs can generate
profits which justify public investment. The elements of the
government strategy to achieve these objectives include:
(a) Development of clear objectives for the PEs;
(b)  Rehabilitation of PEs whose medium-term economic
profitability has been demonstrated;
(c) Improvement of PE management;
(d) Restructuring the parapublic sector through privatization or
cessation of activity when operations are not profitable over
the medium run;
(e) Limitation of the establishment of new PEs to those where
private investors are not forthcoming and whose economic
profitability is demonstrated; and
(f) Establishment of systems to enable the Government to
follow up the cevelopments and performance of the sector.
45.       The Government has decided to create a service with
responsibility for coordinating the rehabilitation program of the
sector as vell as for monitoring its development. This Service in
Charge of the Public Enterprise Sector (SCEP) vill review the current
legislation on the sector and propose changes, as necessary, vith the
objective of avoiding overlapping responsibilities between the PEs and
the relevant ministries and decentralizing and delegating
responsibilities to the maximum extent possible. This service vill
receive technical assistance under the Fourth Technical Assistance
Project. Prices vill be deregulated and public enterprises will be
subject to the same market environment as the private sector.
Exceptional cases vould be made for those enterprises carrying out
non-commercial social activities (which the Government may have to
subsidize), and public utility monopolies for which price regulation
will be appropriate, and vould take into account the requirements
associated with sound financial management.



- 21 -
46.       In the context of the SAL, and based on studies financed by
the Bank, the Government action plan for selected enterprises includes:
-    Closure of four enterprises facing serious financial
probleus: viz., SOBECOV (foodcrops commercialization),
SUPOBU (fishing), AGRIBAL (Agriculture), SOMEBU (studies).
The initiation of the liquidation of these enterprises vould
be a condition of effectivenes of the Credit. In the case of
SOBECOV commercial activities would be liquidated and the
management of storage facilities would be transferred to the
Ministry of Commerce.
-    Reintegration in the public administration of the laboratory
of LAPHAVET (production and research on veterinary products),
and subsidization of two other public enterprises performing
non-commercial activities: CPI (industrial promotion
center), and ONT (tourism promotion);
-    Rehabilitation of a priority group of five enterprises:
CADEBU (savings institutions), ONAPHA (pharmaceuticals),
OTRABU (road transportation), OTRACO (urban transportation),
VERRUNDI (glass factory);
-    Assistance to six major enterprises to design and implement
strategic plans to improve their economic performance in the
medium to long term; and
-    Review of two economic sectors (trade and tourism) and
identification of public enterprises which will be the object
of rehabilitation programs in a second phase.
47.       The rehabilitation programs will be based on diagnostic
studies of each enterprise upon which performance contracts vill be
designed and negotiated. These contracts will include _he objectives
of the enterprise, the strategy adopted, an evaluation of costs and
multi-year targets for operations, type of Government control and
monitoring, and amount of resources contributed by the State. To
assist the rehabilitation program, the Government vill establish an
Intervention Fund in BNDE, which would be jointly managed by SCEP and
BNDE, to finance activities such as rehabilitation investments,
purchase of parts and raw materials, training of personnel, tecbnical
assistance, and enterprises' working capital. The Fund will disburse
in the form of equity capital or loans, and will be financed from the
counterpart funds of the proposed credit. Institutional arrangements
for the Fund would be designed and implemented in the context of the
proposed Fourth Technical Assistance Project, which also would finance
technical assistance services to SCEP and selected enterprises.
C. Agriculture
48.       The acceleration of the GDP and export growth in the medium
term depends crucially on the performance of the agricultural sector to
maintain self-sufficiency in food crops in the rural areas, and



- 22 -
increase production for export. In the past, fooderop production has
been sufficient for the country's staple food needs. Increasing
demographic pressure is leading to abandoning the practice of fallow,
cultivation of marginal lands, reduction in average farm size and
declining soil fertility. A higher level of productivity to offset
these phenomena can be achieved only through intensification, which
will require increased research for and extension of improved
cultivation packages. With respect to export crops, the Government's
objective is to provide adequate incentives to producers, increase
efficiency in resource utilization, and improve crop quality and
marketing. The policy measures included in the SAL program consist of:
(i) tlhe design and establishment of price mechanisus which would allow
for regular adjustment of export crop prices; (il) a modification of
processing techniques for coffee and increased efficiency in its
marketing; and (iii) rationalization of sector organization and
strengthening of research and extension services.
49.       Producer prices.  Prices for locally produced fooderops, both
at producer and consumer level, are market determined, and the
Government intends to continue to pursue this satisfactory policy. As
for producer prices for export crops (coffee, tea, and cotton), which
are determined by the Government, the official policy has been
irregular and has led to a deterioration of prices in real terms. For
example, coffee prices remained constant between 1980 and early 1984
when they vere increased by only 6 percent.  As a result, real prices
declined by 15 percent. For cotton and tea, the decline in real prices
has been even more pronounced. Producer prices remained constant
between 1977 and early 1984 when they were increased by Il percent for
cotton and 30 percent for tea. Considering that the consumer price
index more than doubled between 1977 and 1984, producer prices in real
terms declined by more than 40 percent during that period.
50.       In the context of the proposed adjustment program, the
Government will continue to let fooderop prices be market determined,
and will establish producer prices for export crops at levels
sufficient to provide incentives for increased production and quality,
taking into account the evolution of international prices. For the
1986/87 campaign, the Government has increased coffee prices by
28 percent (from FBu 125/kg to FBu 160/kg) and tea prices by 20 percent
(from FBu 15/kg to FBu 18/kg), thus raising their prices in real
terms. The price of cottonseed has been maintained, given the poor
outlook for international prices for cotton and the relatively high
producer price for cottonseed in Burundi compared with other African
countries. This increase in prices was based in part on a limited
rural consumption survey undertaken in selected producing areas.   For
the following years price will be determined on the basis of: (a) a
rural consumer index updated on a quarterly basis; and (b) regular
surveys of consumption and revenue patterns to assess the potential
competition between crops and between agricultural and non-agricultural
activities of farmers.



- 23 -
51.       Coffee processing, marketing, and pricing.  In recent years,
Burundi has invested in the construction of coffee vashing stations to
improve the quality of exported coffee. In 1983, Burundi received a
premium of 18 percent for fully washed coffee (FWA) over the price of
washed coffee. In 1985, this premium had eroded to less than
4 percent. Based on the conclusions Gf a study financed under the SPPF
for SAC I, this decline vas due to (a) a decrease in coffee quality
because of too-high levels of humidity of both parched and green
coffee, which resulted from inadequate storage and handling conditions;
and (b) the weak management capacity and performance of the coffee
marketing board, the Burundi Coffee Company (BCC), which raises doubts
as to whether Burundi obtains the best price for its coffee. These
problems could be overcome at a relatively low cost (approximately USS3
to $4 million) through additional investments in storage facilities,
grading and handling equipment at the processing plants and at the
harbor, and through improved management of both the coffee processing
and marketing chains.  The Governuent has taken steps to decrease the
humidity content of parched coffee by lovering the humidity requirement
of parched coffee delivered to the factories and installing additional
drying equipment at the two existing factories.  The Government's
action program, in the context of the proposed credit, includes:
(a) Preparation of additional actions to improve coffee quality,
including necessary investments, studies and recruitment of
technical assistance. These measures will be prepared and
financed under the proposed IDA Muyinga and the Fourth
Technical Assistance Projects; and
(b)  Preparation of a  medium-term strategy for the coffee sector
to maximize export revenues, taking into account the
potential for increased output and quality, competition among
crops, and prospects and fluctuations in the coffee
international market. This strategy would be based on:
- a study of the sliding scale of coffee prices, taking into
account the requirements of a marketing and processing
system that places greater emphasis on quality and on
efficiency of the processing and commercialization.- 
circuits. This study is to be carried out with financing
from the French Caisse Centrale de Coopration Economique.
- an analysis of the revenue and cultivation practices of
the farmers vith the objective to analyze competition
among crops and among agricultural versus non-agricultural
activities, which is being carried out by the lNational
Institute of Statistics;
- analysis of the country's production potential taking into
account area planted, average yields, effects on ongoing
investments to-improve quality;



- 24 -
- establishment of a medium-term producer price policy aimed
at maximizing incremental foreign exchange gain, taking
into account ICA quota, fluctuations in domestic
production, and price differential in off-quota markets.
52.       Institutional framework. To formulate and implement
agricultural policies and maximize the impact of resources allocated to
the sector, the Government decided to review the organization of the
sector, in particular the respective functions of the Regional
Development Companies (RDCs) and the national offices of the Ministries
of Agriculture and Livestock and of Rural Development at the central,
regional and local levels.
53.       In the past, RDCs have had multiple functions, including
productive agricultural activities (processing and marketing of export
crops), support activities (extension, research, input distribution,
and maintenance of rural roads), and social activities (education and
health). Experience to date shows that although the RDCs have a
comparative advantage for processing and marketing, their agricultural
and social services have been provided at an excessively high cost,
making them dependent on financial support, either from the Government
or from external donors. Moreover, the managerial demands imposed on
the RDCs by this multiplicity of functions exceed the existing
capacity. It is, therefore, clear that for the RDCs to be able to
carry out the functions entrusted to them in a cost-effective manner,
they should concentrate on productive and commercial activities. In
the context of the preparation of the IDA Agricultural Research and
Services Project (FY88), the services of the Ministry of Agriculture
and Livestock will be progressively strengthened at the regional and
national level to gradually take over some of the functions now carried
out by RDCs. They would assume primary responsibility for research and
extension, in addition to the planning, project preparation and
monitoring and collection of statistics that they already carry out.
D. Trade and Industrial Policies
54.       Burundi's industrial and trade policies have been highly
protective, sheltering the modern sector from domestic and foreign
competition. Protection is provided, inter alia, by customs duties,
quantitative import restrictions and prohibitions, regulation of
importers, and control of new investments. In this protective
environment, the value added of the modern industrial sector expanded
at an average annual rate of 13 percent in real terms from 1978 to
1982, but then slowed to about 4.5 percent in 1983-85 as a result of
the depressed domestic demand and lack of foreign exchange to import
raw materials and spare parts. During the earlier period of rapid
growth, production remained typical of the first generation of import
substitution, with exports limited to processed coffee, tea, cotton and
few other goods. In addition, part of this growth was due to the start
of production of new enterprises. Capacity utilization of existing
firms is low. Most of them operate at less than 50 percent capacity,
with some as low as 15-20 percent.



- 25 -
55.       With the exception of a few enterprises, the sector is
inefficient and relies mainly on imported goods. Despite the natural
protection (provided by the landlocked situation of the country, which
is equivalent to a 30 percent tariff) and high tariffs, many
enterprises rely on prohibition of competing imports to operate. Their
production costs are high, and the quality of their products is in many
cases below international standards. Hovever, the sector as a whole is
profitable, with profits before tax averaging 20 percent of sales.
This is due to the monopolistic situation enjoyed by most firms and the
cost-plus system of price setting and controls.
56.       The measures proposed under the structural adjustment program
reflect the increasing avareness of the Government that efficient
economic growth, based on the country's comparative advantages, will
require a substantial reform of present trade and industrial policies.
The objective of opening up the Burundian economy to competition (both
domestic and foreign) is an essential component of the Goverament's
structural adjustment program. The Government's long-term policy is
that import restrictions, price controls and industrial regulations
should not be used to protect domestic producers, vith the possible
exception of infant industries, which vill benefit from special
protection during a limited period of time (see para. 60). It is avare
that efforts to reduce the effective level of protection and the bias
towards domestic vis--vis export production are essential to
restructure the economy and stimulate competitive exports to support
growth. The liberalization measures outlined in para. 60 and detailed
in the Policy Statement on Trade and Industry (Annex VII) reflect the
Governament's growing recognition of the importance of market forces,
correct price signals and private initiative; they include actions on
trade policies, price regulations and the Investment Code.
57.       Trade policies.  At present, all imports require a license
from the central bank (BRB). For products competing with local
production, quantitative restrictions are in place and imports are
authorized only when domestic production is not sufficient to meet
local demand. Import licenses are subject to a fee of one percent of
their f.o.b. value. The profession of importer is strictly regulated
by the Government. Imports can be made only by authorized traders who
are required to specialize in one of 20 product categories and who must
ensure that at least 50 percent of the total value of their imports
falls into that category.  Importers pay an annual fee and make
security deposits of FBu 1 million (Burundian nationals) or
FBu 2 million (foreigners).
58.       Imports are subject to three different duties:  a customs
duty, a fiscal duty, and a statistical tax.  All are based on c.i.f.
value, which includes a substantial transport cost due to Burundi's
landlocked position. Their combined incidence yields tariff rates
varying from 4 percent to 150 percent ad valorem.  The import tariff
structure comprises: low duties (4 to 15 percent) on essential
foodstuffs and on many inputs for agriculture and industry, including
machinery and equipment (with the exception of those financed by
foreign aid); high duties on luxury consumer goods (generally



- 26 -
100 percent or more); and mediun-to-high rates on imports competing
vith domestic producte and on various consumer goods. The disparity in
duty rates is increased by the policy, set down in the Investment Code,
of granting exemptions of duty on industrial inputs. All exports are
in principle subject to an export tax, but exemptions can be granted by
the Finance Ministry. For manufactured exports the export tax is a
flat 3 percent on the f.o.b. value. When duties have been paid on
imported inputs, exemptions of the export tax can in principle be
obtained.
59.       The present trade regime is a source of inefficiency as it
provides different protection levels between sectors and firms and
encourages monopolistic practices. Estimates of effective protection
confirm the presumption of high and variable protection granted to
local industry as rates range from 4 percent to about 800 percent, and
average about 110 percent. When non-tariff barriers are taken into
account, effective protection increases significantly. The combined
incidence of tariff and licensing on non-competing imports is similarly
high. This situation enables importers to realize high rents ranging
up to about 500 percent and causes high losses to both consumers and
the Government (the rent transfers from Governuent to importers for a
sample of 55 products is estimated to amount to FBu 2 billion, that is
more than half of total import duties collected in 1985).
60.       To correct the distortions caused by the present protection
system, the Government has decided to implement a program of trade
liberalization and tariff rationalization aimed at lovering the level
of protection offered to the industrial sector and reducing the
dispersion in effective protection. These measures include:
'i) Elimination of most import licenses. Only a limited number
of non-essential, luxury products (as listed in the Policy
Statement on Trade and Industry) and three groups of
manufactured goods (glass, cotton textiles, and
pharmaceutical products) vill be subject to temporary
import licensing;
(ii)  Introduction by the same time, of a simplified customs
tariff, comprising a reduced number of duties (two instead of
three) and a reduced number of duty rates (5 instead of 57).
The new tariff structure and implementation calendar are as
follows:



- 27 -
Present
Structure  -    Proposed Rates-
Range    1986   1987   1988   1989
Luxury Products           30-250      100    100    100    100
Manufactured Goods        15-100       50     45     40      40
Primary Products and
Industrial Inputs        5-55       15      20     25      30
Food Products              5-100       25     25     25      25
Capital Goods              5-40        15     20     20      20
For a few cases in which higher rates appear to be necessary
(e.g., to protect infant industries), the Government will
introduce formal procedures to grant selected enterprises a
temporary relief in the form of an import surcharge levied on
a c.i.f. cost-plus tariff.  This surcharge, which vill not
exceed 30 percent, vill be granted for a period of three
years at the maximum, during which it vill be gradually
eliminated. Exemptions granted under the Investment Code
vill be gradually removed and only imports by the Central
Government and the diplomatic corps vill be exempted from
customs duties. The arrangements made under the Preferential
Trade Agreement (PTA) vill be respected. Ve have reviewed
those arrangements and are satisfied that they are compatible
vith the proposed program;
(iii)  Revision of regulations governing the profession of importer
with a view to eliminating provisions which lead to
monopolization.
(iv)  Elimination of all export taxes on manufactured products
produced locally. The Goverrment vill also reactivate the
drawback system which exists but is not well known to
exporters.
Implementation of the new trade regime, including measures (i) to (iv)
above, would be a condition of effectiveness of the proposed Credit.
61.       Price controls.  All imported and locally produced goods are
subject to price controls (the responsibility of the Ministry of
Commerce and Industry). Prices are set on a "cost-plus" basis, with
the manufacturer receiving a negot:iable net profit margin of 10 to
20 percent. Gross wholesale and retail mark-ups are also set for
imported goods and vary between 15 and 30 percent. A staff of 10
persona is charged vith revieving all price submissions by importers
and manufacturers, as vell as vith carrying out inspections.
62.       Price control aims at preventing producers and traders from
making excessive profits in a monopolistic market.  This measure may
have succeeded in reducing profit margins in a few cases, but its main
drawback is that it discourages efforts towards greater efficiency.
The cost-plus formula does not encourage importers to look for the
cheapest source of supply. Similarly, a fixed profit margin removes



- 28 -
the incentive for manufacturera to reduce costs and become more
efficient. As the instructions given to manufacturers do not specify
at what level of capacity utilization the prices should be calculated,
the system actually allovs firas operating at low capacity to pass on
all the costs (including depreciation) and thereby remain financially
profitable.
63.       The Governument recognizes that a price control system is not
consistent with the new liberalization policy and could hamper the
process of relative price adjustment and rationalize resource
allocation that should occur vith the tariff reform. It has therefore
decided to liberalize prices at the same pace as imports. No control
vill be exercised on products for which importation is liberalized and
only certain strategic products (including flour, sugar, paper, iron
sheets, and powdered milk) vould be submitted to a price ceiling (for
no more than four months) in case of acute shortages. The price of oil
products (gasoline, kerosene and diesel) and cement will be controlled
by the Governument and adjusted periodically, taking into account the
prices in international markets and fiscal considerations. The
deregulation of prices for products whose imports have been liberalized
(except for the cases mentioned above) would be a condition of
effectivenese of the proposed Credit.
64.       Investment Code.  Established in 1967, and revised in 1979,
the Code aims at encouraging investment in priority areas by offering
certain privileges and guarantees. To qualify for these benefits,
investments must: (i) be in a priority sector as defined by the Plan;
(ii) be of a minimum size, i.e., FBu 15 million (US$127,000) for new
projects and FBu 10 million (US$85,000) in the case of extensions; and
(iii) be considered satisfactory from a technical point of view, as
vell as in teras of job creation and value added, the provision of
training, the impact on the balance of payments, etc.
65.       The benefits offered include exemption of the import duty on
materials and equipment at the time of installation, exemption of duty
on imported inputs for up to five years, and a tax holiday for up to
five years.  Of the various other kinds of assistance offered, the most
important is the protection against competing imports which, however,
the manufacturer could also obtain from the Ministry of Commerce and
Industry and the Central Bank. Projects of particular importance for
the development of the country, and those established outside
Bujumbura, may receive additional assistance. The former must either
create a minimum number of jobs (100 for industrial enterprises and 150
for agriculture or agro-industry projects) or consist of an investment
of at least FBu 500 million (US$4.3 million) for agriculture and
agro-industry, or FBu 1 billion (US$8.5 million) for other industries.
Such investment may, in addition to the benefits already mentioned,
enjoy a reduction in tax on profits for a further ten years, while an
additional extension of the tax holiday to seven years is available for
those located away from Bujumbura.



- 29 -
66.       To obtain any of these advantages, the proposed investment is
evaluated by two committees - the National Technical Committee which
reviews the project from the technical point of view, and the National
Investment Committee which studies the project in the conte't of the
overall national investment strategy - and must receive Cabinet
approval.
67.       The overall system has several drawbacks.  The administrative
review process is elaborate and time consuming. Promoters are required
to submit a great amount if detail on the technical, economic and legal
aspects of the project. If all the information is provided as
requested, it takes about four months from the time of submission
before the application is approved. Usually the process takes longer.
Moreover, the provisions of the Code reinforce the pro-capital bias of
the tariff system and discriminate against the development and use of
local substitutes. Many small and medium enterprises are also not
eligible for incentives under the Code since their projects are
generally below the minimum investment requirement of
FBu 10-15 million. One of the objectives of the proposed reform is to
improve the effectiveness of the Investment Code.
68.       In the context of the proposed credit, the Government has
decided revise the Investment Code in order to:
(i) Eliminate the guarantee of the local market. The Government
-ill not prohibit the establishment of new enterprises even
if they compete with existing activities;
(ii) Eliminate the exemption of import duties on equipment and
industrial imports. The Code's benefit will consist
essentially of a profit tax exemption for a fixed period;
(iii)  Reserve the benefits offered by the Investment Code to
projects which have an economic rate of return of more than
10 percent and an investment cost per job of less thar.
US$20,000;
(iv)  Introduce measures to facilitate access of small enterprises
to the benefits of the Code; and
(v) Reduce the review process to a maximum of three months.
Applications submitted by promoters should be approved or
rejected during that period.
The adoption of the revised Investment Code would be a condition of
effectiveness of the proposed Credit.
69.       Public industrial investments.  In view of the disappointing
results of past public investments in the industrial sector and
consistent with the stated objective of encouraging private
investments, the Government has decided to reduce its role in the
sector. The public investment program for 1986-88 includes only three
industrial projects, of which the major is the SOSUMO project (see
para. 34).

E. Credit Allocation System
70.       The major problen vith the credit system in Burundi appears
to be its insufficient orientation to productive investments, and its
continuing de facto discrimination against small borrovers. In this
respect, the performance of the development bank (BNDE) and the
Burundian Finance Society (SBF), the two institutions whose lending
activities should, in principle, be oriented to productive, as opposed
to commercial, investments, have been particularly disappointing. In
recent years, the large majority of credits accorded by both
institutions have been for short-term financing of the coffee crop,
rather than for longer-term productive investments. To stimulate
lending of these and other financial institutions to small- and
medium-scale enterprises, a Guarantee Fund vas established in 1984, but
it has not yet begun operations.
71.       The current system of credit regulation is characterized by
an overly complex administrative and regulatory framework and is in
need of considerable reform. It is insufficiently adapted both to the
current needs of the Burundian economy - in particular the need to
promote productive investments, especially by small-scale enterprises
- and the increasing sophistication of domestic financial
institutions. The requirement that all credit requests for anounts
over FBu 3 million (about US$25,000) be approved in advance by the
central bank has posed a particular problem, as it has frequently led
to substantial delays, as vell as to unnecessary uncertainty on the
part of potential borrovers.
72.       In order to influence the credit allocation of commercial
banks in favor of high priority sectors, all credits, under the present
system, are classified by the Central Ban k as either discountable
("mobilisable") or non-discountable ("non-mobilisable'). Maximum
lending rates are set by the Central Bank for each category of credit,
and vithin each category, lending rates are several percentage points
higher for non-discountable credits. At the present time, lending
rates range from a minimum of 6 percent (for export credits, which are
discountable 'by nature") to 15 percent (for short-term
non-discountable credits). While in recent years about two-thirds of
the outstanding credits of commercial banks have been classified as
discountable, outside the coffee season only a small portion of credits
are discounted at the Central Bank.
73.       In addition to Central Bank control over credit creation
through its right of approval of individual loan requests, credit is
regulated also through a series of ratios which each commercial bank
must respect (or pay a penalty). The two most important ratios are a
minimum liquidity ratio, for which purposes discountable credits are
classified as liquid assets, and a minimum ratio for mediumr-term
discountable credits.
74.         The Government is avare of the difficulties which confront
the credit allocation system and intends to introduce reforms. Initial
measures to be implemented in the context of the SAL include:



- 31 -
(a)  An increase from FBu 3 million to FBu 10 million (about
US$80,000) for credits which can be granted by commercial
banks vithout prior approval of the Central Bank; this would
b.e a condition of effectiveness of the Credit. This limit
vill be reviewed on a regular basis to take lnto account the
effect of domestic inflation. This limit of
FBu 10 million vill also apply to medium- and long-term
credits; and
(b) Measures for promoting lending to small- and medium-sized
enterprises, auch as activation of the Guarantee Fund,
which would make use of the SAL counterpart funds to start
operations.
75.       To prepare for a second stage of reform, the Government vill
create an ad hoc committee under the direction of the Governor of the
Central Bank and including representatives of the commercial banks,
other financial institutions, the Ministry of Finance, Industrial
Promotion Center, and other concerned agencies and institutions. The
Comuittee will examine and make recommendations on the folloving
Issues:
(i) The distinction between discountable and non-discountable
credits, notably on whether there is a need to distinguish
between two categories of credits (vith different interest
rates) or on whether promotion of certain economic
activities could be accomplished more efficiently through
direct subsidies rather than through subsidized interest
rates, or whether any of those are advisable at ail;
(iI)  Coefficients of liquidity and use of medium-term resources.
Depending on the recoumendetion concerning the above point,
the Committee vill examine the possibility of replacing the
present controls over credit allocation exercised through
these two ratios by alternative measures (e.g., required
reserves ratios and minimum lending rations for medium- and
long-term credits) whose definition does not involve
distinguishing between credits according to whether or not
they are discountable; and
(iii) Structure of interest rates. The Committee vill examine
the possibility of alloving banks and other financial
institutions greater authority in setting both lending and
deposit rates.
Part IV - THE PROPOSED OPERATION
A. History
76.       The proposed credit is the first of an expected series of
credits to support the Government's structural adjustment efforts. A
Statement of Development Policies (Annex IV) from the Ministers of



- 32 -
Planning and Finance, sets out the major elements in the program and
the policy actions envisaged during mid-1986 to end-1987. Statements
of Policies for the Public Enterprises Sector, Agriculture, Trade and
Industry, and Public Expenditures Program have also been prepared by
the Government and are attached as Annexes V through VIII. The
macroeconomic elements of the program vere identified initially as a
result of an economc mission which visited the country in May 1983,
and whose findings were updated in July 1984. (The report was
presented to the Board in December 1984.) These were further developed
jointly between the Government, the Fund and the Bank. The Public
Investment component of the program was developed during a Bank mission
which visited Burundi in October 1984, and its findings were reported
to the Government in April 1985. The agricultural component was
developed by Bank sector mission which visited the country in July 1985
to review the role of the regional development companies (RDCs), by
consultants to review the coffee sector, and by Bank staff during the
first preparation mission (May 1985). The Industrial and Trade
component vas developed by a Bank Industrial Sector Mission during 1983
(report was discussed with the Government in 1984), and further
detailed by the preparation mission and consultants' work notably on
effective protection. The Public Enterprise component was prepared by
consultants in May 1985, which updated and used to a great extent a
study financed by the Bank in 1982. Consultants' services were
financed under an advance from the Special Project Preparation
Facility.
77.       An appraisal mission visited Burundi in November/December
1985 and appraisal was completed in January 1986 during an official
visit of a government delegation to Washington. Negotiations took
place in Washington in April 1986. The Government's delegation was
headed by the Ministry of Planing.
B. Relationship between the Proposed Operation and Policy Reforms
78.       The proposed credit vould finance the first phase (1986-87)
of the Government's medium-term structural adjustment program which is
to be implemented in conjunction with the stabilization program to be
supported by the IMF. There are close linkages between the two
programs particularly in the areas of public expenditures, trade,
tariff and pricing policies. The two programs are summarized in
Table 5.

C. Effects of the Adjustment Program
79.       As outlined in Part II, the Government's mediumn-term
structural adjustuent program, the first phase of which is supported by
the proposed SAL and by the IMF program, is expected in the next 10 to
15 years to substantially strengthen the productive sectors, reduce the
economy's dependence on coffee, and lay the basis for sustained
growth. Projections of selected economic indicators, for both the
short and medium term and for two cases, with and vithout structural
adjustment are given in Table 6.
80.       Both cases use the same assumptions regarding the coffee
prices: an increase from US$3.21/kg in 1985 to US$4.70/kg in 1986,
declining in 1986 to US$4.05/kg in 1987 and staying at this level until
1990. After 1990, coffee prices are projected to increase in nominal
terms to reach US$5.30/kg in 1995. In the first case, the volume of
coffee exports is projected to increase from 34,000 tons in 1986 to
39,000 in 1989. This assumes that Burundi will be able to negotiate a
favorable quota with the ICA after 1987 in accordance with the
country's export potential and that producer incentives are adequate
to ensure needed tree-pruning and maintenance in the short-run and
replanting in the longer run. and in the medium run through increased
area planted. The effect of changes in producer prices on production
levels vas projected according to estimated elasticities.
81.       The two scenarios illestrate the impact of the overall
structural adjustment package on the economy. The principal
differences lie, thus, on the assumptions on the exchange rate, the
amount of external capital flows, the efficiency of resource
allocation, the tariff reform and the liberalization of the economy,
the incentives to private investment, and the action program for the
agricultural sector. The poli.cy case assumes an immediate devaluation
of the Burundian franc vith respect to the SDR, followed by a
"catch-up- devaluation during the next twelve months, and a flexible
policy thereafter. It assumes that the SAL capital flows would be
supplemented by moderate additional amounts from other sources that are
presumed to be conditional on the SAL agreements; it assumes increased
efficiency from improved resource allocation, with consequent
reorientation of production tovards exports and efficient import
susbstitution, and increased use ol local factors of production rather
than of imports, it further assumes maintenance of purchasing pover of
export crops producers, prudent monetary and fiscal folicies, holding
inflation to less than 10 percent, and allowing credit to the private
sector to grow in conformity vith the needs for investment; finally,
the policy case assumes replacement of quantitative restrictions by a
tariff-based protective structure, and a decline in import exemptions.
82.       The non-policy case, on the other hand, assumes that the
exchange rate depreciates only in line vith the difference between
domestic and international inflation rates; it assumes that vithout SAL
inflows the aid programs of other sources would be smaller as well; it
assumes less efficiency in resource allocation, higher import
elasticities, and higher budget deficit/GDP ratios; producer prices for
main export crops are not adjusted regularly and fall in real prices,

leading to a slover growth in main export crops; and no trade reform
would take place. The Government would continue to control imports by
administrative means in order to limit the balance of payments deficits
and the need to borrow at commercial terms.

are the combined result of the recent increase in coffee prices, the
increase in foreign aid flows associated with the Structural Adjustment
Program, and the Government's commitment to pursue prudent fiscal and
monetary policies, thus avoiding excessive pressure on the balance of
payments. It is estimated that the current account deficit vill be
contained at US$86 million and US$123 million in 1986 and 1987
respectlvely and that foreign exchange reserves will average an
equivalent of 4 months of imports. On the domestic front, public
spending will be limited to a level which can be sustained in the
future. In this context, the expected increase in revenues together
vith a prudent policy of public spending will lead to higher public
savings. These are expected to average 9 percent of GDP during 1986-87
(compared with 5 percent in 1985), allowing the Governuent to



- 42 -
contribute to the financing of the public investment program and repay
part of its domestic debt. While this repayment is not a goal in
itaself, it vwll allow an expansion of private credit (and private
investment) while keeping expansion of the money supply at the levels
agreed upon between the Governuent and the Fund.
84.       Mediua-term effects.  In the medium term the improvements in
the economy as a result of more efficient investment and the creation
of appropriate incentives for agriculture and industry should lead to
higher growth and more efficient resource use (as reflected ln the
incremental capital output ratio and other measures of factor
productivity). Growth of non-agriculture GDP for the period 1986-90 is
expected to average 4.0 percent per annum, compared with 1.8 percent in
the absence of a reform program.
85.       The most important changes in the economy would come from the
agricultural and industrial sector. Agricultural exports will increase
as the result of better incentives for increased production and
diversification. Food production is expected to increase faster in the
policy case as the result of better sector organization, easier access
to imported chemical inputs, and increased purchasing pover of the
rural sector. The substantial increase in income passed on to the
rural sector by the agreed increase in producer prices for coffee and
tea ie expected to generate domestic demand for goods which can be
produced locally, by 3mali-sized enterprises, using more
labor-intensive production technologies. Moreover, the industrial
sector is expected to benefit from the opening of the economy, increase
its efficiency and orient production towards exporte, folloving the
reform in incentives, notably the exchange rate, the trade
liberalization, and the deregulation of prices. The major public
enterprises are supposed to engage in rehabilitation plans which vill
render them more efficiert and more able to finance their own
investments. Private investment, both from abroad and domestic, ls
expected to increase rapidly especially in the two to three years after
the beginning of the program, allowing a growth of capital formation of
about 2.5 percent per year, compared vith 0.5 percent in the nou-policy
case. This investment is likely to be oriented in larger shares to
productive activities rather than commerce and trade as a consequence
of increased incentives to private investment (including smafl-sized
enterprised) and greater competition in the trade sector. In the
medium to long term, the relative use of domestic inputs vill make the
economy less dependent on imports and more intensive in local inputs,
lncluding labor.
D. Benefits and Riske
86.       Benefits. The main benefits of the SAL are in the form of
policy adjustment described above which are expected to lead to
improvements in the efficiency and allocation of resources and hence
improvements in the balance of payments in the long term.



- 43 -
87.       Risks.  The Government's structural adjustment program has
two main risks. The first arises from the difficulties in estimating
the quantitative effect of the policy reforms on the economy. The
projections illustrate on the basis of one set of reasonable
assumptions what the policy program is likely to achieve during the
next ten years. Hovever, neither the magnitude nor the timing of the
long-term benefits or transitional disruptions can be predicted with
certainty. Hence, although the ultimate benefits from the reforms are
estimated to be considerable, the length and difficulties of the
adjustment process are less clear. In particular, the prospects
outlined in the policy scenario are derived on the assumption of export
growth and moderate growth in consumer goods importe folloving the
liberalization efforts. Factors which may threaten the balance of
payments equilibrium include a sudden drop in the coffee prices, the
establishment by ICA of coffee quotas for Burundi below the export
potential of the country (forcing Burundi to export to the off-quota
countries), increased protectionism in foreign countries, a quick
revival in domestic demand, and other external factors such as adverse
weather conditions or disruptions in the transport corridors. These
risks are important for the recovery of the Burundi economy. Failure
to expand import capacity, given the economic dependence on imports,
would mean that Burundi wnuld have to resort to a strategy of lower
growth as a mechanism of adjustment to avoid the problems faced in
recent years.
88.       Tlue other risk relates to the tinely and continued
implementation of the program. The trade liberalization program is
likely to meet with resistance from those benefiting from excess
protection or from rents on imports, and private investment may remain
sluggish if commerce activities continue to provide higher rates of
return than direct productive activities. These risks will diminish in
the future as the effects of the measures begin to show positive
results. Continued support at the highest level of the Government is
therefore needed to ensure the success of the program. Such support
will have to lnclude adequate incentives to foreign capital, at least
on a non-discriminatory basis as compared with nationals.
89.       There are some features which reduce the above risks.  First,
a flexible exchange rate vill be helpful in minimizing the pressure of
the liberalization program on the balance of payments. Second, there
are programs to assist the enterprises to reform and to benefit from
the new system of incentives. Third, the major foreign donors have
taken an active interest in the preparation of this program (e.g.,
USAID, UNDP, France, etc.), and they are expected to provide extra
financial support in case the expected effects of the program are
slower to materialize or extraordinary circumatances occur which may
jeopardize the succesa of the Government's program. Finally, the
Goverament is seriously committed to the program and to opening the
economy to market forces and private initiative. It recently (February
1986) held a seminar on the privatization of the Burundian economy, to
present the main elements of the reform and stimulate the interest of
the private sector. This seminar was well received by the business
community. The Governuent's determination to pursue the objectives of



- 44 -
structural adjustment is, in the final analysis, an important
determinant for the increased role of private investment in the future
growth of the economy.
E. Social Costa of Restructuring
90.       The structural adjustient program in Burundi is likely to
entail some transitional costs, primarily in terms of stagnation in
real consumption levels in order to permit savinge and investment for
the future and a reallocation of incomes between different social and
economic groups. Although it is possible to attach some quantitative
indicators only to the first component, the second (the redistributive
impact) is likely to be of at least equal importance during the SAL
implementation. The first part of this adjustment has taken place
already. Between the period 1978-81 and 1984-85, Burundi's per capita
consumption fell by about 10 percent in real terme. According to our
projections of the policy case, per capita consumption will remain at
about the same level until 1990.  After that it could begin to increase
by approximately 1 to 2 percent per annum.
91.       Few reliable data on income distribution in Burundi are
available. Using national accounts information we can, however, detect
large differences between average urban and rural real incomes, the
difference is about 1:8. As a result of the program, the income
distribution vould shift from urban areas to rural communities as a
whole. Farmers' real incomes would benefit from the new pricing
policies for agriculture exports, while urban consumers are already
paying higher prices for all basic food commodities.  Urban incomes
vill be reduced by Government policies for the containment of vage
and employment increases, especially in the public sector which
represents half the formal employment market, and for the restraint of
other current expenditures and transfers. In the past, the public
investment program vas used to provide employment, but this policy can
no longer be pursued.
92.       The reform of incentive policies for industry may typify the
overall effects of the program on employment and income distribution:
in the short run, some reduction in vage rates and/or employment may
occur, as inefficient firms are faced with increased import
competition. In the medium term, however, new employment opportunities
and improved earnings are expected as manufacturing and processing
industries respond to the new situation and as controls on internal
trade are relaxed.  The favorable environment for investment in the
private sector would favor a reallocation of employment from the public
to the private sector, which would allow an increase in average
salaries in the Central Government together wvth a readjustment of
functions and vage structure. The speed at which these economic and
social adjustments vill take place, particularly those dependent on the
supply response of farmers and industrialists, is hard to predict.
What is certain is that the Government will need to exercise all its
skills to ensure that the essential consensus in favor of the total



- 45 -
reform package is preserved.  Whatever social costs are involved in the
short term, they would be lese than those compared with the situation
which vould arise from a later forced adjustment.
F. Proposed Financing
93.       The financing package would include a proposed Development
Credit of SDR 13.2 million (US$15 million) and an African Facility
Credit of SDR 14.3 million (US$16.2 million) and Special Joint
Financing including a Swiss grant of SwF 15 million (US$7.7 million
equivalent), a Japanese grant of Yen 400,000 (US$2.2 million), and a
Japanese loan of Yen 1.6 billion (US$8.9 million). The proposed
financing, totaling US$50 million, would cover about Il percent of
Burundi's total merchandise imports and about 20 percent of the gross
capital inflows over the calendar years 1986 and 1987, the period of
disbursement. This amount is appropriate in light of the quality of
the program and the size of the IDA lending program for Burundi.
G. Disbursement, Procurement, Administration and Auditing
94.       The proposed financing would be disbursed in two tranches and
is expected to be fully disbursed vithin 18 months of effectiveness.
The firet tranche of US$25 million would be available upon
effectiveness. The second tranche of US$25 million would become
available about six months later. Disbursement of the second tranche
would be contingent on satisfactory progress with respect to
(i) continued implementation of the first phase of the Government's
structural adjustment program, in particular the tariff reform and
import liberaJization program; and (ii) the measures listed in
Attachment I of the Government's Letter of Development Policy and
para. 102.
95.       SAL financing would be limited to imports procured from Bank
member countries, and Switzerland.  Special African Facility financing
would be limited to imports procured from eligible countries under the
SAF. Except for a few exclusions such as tobacco, alcohol, luxury and
defense items, any imports vould be eligible for financing, but no more
than a total of US$25.G million would be used for petroleum and food
importa. All purchases, both public and private, under contracts
amounting to US$0.8 million or more would be procured through ICB in
accordance with Bank guidelines. Imports for contracts of less than
US$0.8 million equivalent would be in accordance with the usual
practices of the purchaser and, for imports from public agencies, vould
include as a minimum the submission of at least three quotations unless
the purchase necessarily involves proprietary equipment. Expenditures
for goods procured under contracts of less than US$10,000 equivalent
would not be eligible for Bank financing.
96.       The credit vould reimburse 100 percent of the foreign
exchange cost of eligible imports on the basis of evidence that they
were paid for and imported after credit signing. Goode not eligible
for financing include alcoholic beverages, tobacco, precious metals and
stones, veapons and military equipnent. Imports financed by other



- 46 -
sources vould also not be eligible for IDA financing.  The Central Bank
would be responsible for assembling requested supporting documentation
collected f'rom the commercial banks, to be provided as follows:  For
small contracts between US$1O,OOO and US$200,000 equivalent, statements
of expenditures will be used. All documentation including invoices
would be retained by the Central Bank for periodic examination by Bank
staff. The statements of expenditures would be signed by the Central
Bank and vould include the country of origin, a description of goods,
the date of payment, the currency in which the payment was effected,
the exchange rate used for the U.S. dollar equivalent charged to the
Special Accounts, and the name and address of the final beneficiary.
For all contracta above US$200,000, full documentation would accompany
withdrawal applications. In order to facilitate disbursements, two
Special Accounts, one for IDA funds and one for AF funds, would be
established in the central bank in lts name into which the IDA would
make two initial deposits of US$5 million for IDA and US$7 million for
AF. The Special Accounta would be replenished at regular intervals
against withdraval applications, for a minimum of US$500,000 each.
Verification and Audit
97.       To facilitate the monitoring of the use of funds under the
Credit, disbursements would be subject to verification by a reputable
inspection fira of quantities and quality, and except in cases of ICB,
prices. The Special Accounts and the atatements of expenditures would
be audited by an independent auditor.
H. Counterpart Funds
98.       The Governuent agreed that the Burundi franc counterpart
funds generated by the proposed financing would be deposited in the
National Development Bank and vould be used to finance operations
designated by the Government In support of its structural adjustment
procesa and its development policy. The Government has indicated that
it would give priority in the use of the counterpart funds to
financing: (i) the rehabilitation program of the Public Enterprises
sector; and (ii) the Guarantee Fund for credit to small and medium
investors. In addition, the Governient would provide the Association
with information on the use of counterpart funds, on a quarterly
basis.
I. Monitoring
99.       Monitoring of performance under the SAL involves essentially
two complementary and inter-related activities: a more general
monitoring of the progress on implementing the program and the
monitoring of specific progress as a condition of tranche release. The
action program described below reflects the agreements reached vith the
Governuent concerning the reforma to take place before credit
effectivenesa and specific conditions for release of the second
tranche. We have also included the actions which have already taken
place.



- 47 -
100.      The folloving actions have already been taken by the
Government under the proposed program:
(a)   Agreement on the objectives and polices of a
mid-1986/end-1987 financial prograo vith the IMF
(paras. 23-28);
(b)   An increase in the producer prices of tea and coffee from
FBu 15/kg to FBu 18/kg and from FBu 125/kg to FBu 160/kg,
redpectively, (para. 50);
(c)   Liberalization of the producer prices for rice -  the
government intervention in the rice market is nov limited to
providing a minimum price. Producers are free to sell their
production to the IMBO-RDC;
(d)   Preparation of a strategy and an action plan for
restructuring the Public Enterprises Sector (paras. 44-47);
and
(e)   Agreement on the level of public investment (para. 31);
101.      The following actions vill be taken before effectiveness of
the proposed credit:
<a)   Implementation of the new trade regime (para. 60);
(b)   Deregulation of prices for products for which imports have
been liberalized (para. 63);
(c)   Revision of the Investment Code (para. 68);
Cd) Increase in the credit limite above which the commercial
banks need approval from the Central Bank to FBu 10 million
(para. 74(a)); and
(e)   Initiation of liquidation procedures for four public
enterprises (para. 46).
102.      The following conditions will be conditions of release of the
second tranche:
(a) Preparation of the macroeconomic scenario for 1987-89,
including level and composition of public investment and
public expenditure program (para. 35);
(b)  Review of the import controls still remaining on luxury
consumer goods and on three groups of imported goods
competing with local manufactures (para. 60(i));



- 48 -
(c)  Completion of surveys on rural consumption and revenue
patterns and estimation, in consultation with IDA, of the
level of producer prices of main export crops for the 1987/88
campaign (paras. 50 and 51);
(d)  Initiation of preparation of rehabilitation plans for the
five public enterprises to be rehabilitated in priority
(first phase of the PE rehabilitation program) (para. 46);
and
(e) Identification of public enterprises to be rehabilitated in
Phase II (para. 46).
PART V - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS AND STRATEGY
103.      The history of Bank Group operations in Burundi closely
follows the country's political and economic evolution since
independence in 1962. During the political instability of the 1962-76
period, IDA operations vere limited to coffee production, highways and
water supply. After 1976, with the period of increased political
stability, lending expanded rapidly, notably in agriculture and
highways as well as in new sectors: fisheries, forestry, education,
industry and rural development. Financing was also provided to improve
the telecommunications and pover network, explore the feasibility of
exploiting nickel deposits, strengthening the capacity of the Ministry
of Planning and improve the management of urban services in Bujumbura.
The effects of a decline in international aid programs and domestic
financial constraints led to a slowdown in project lending in FY82-84
which, however, was accompanied by a substantial increase in economic
and sector work to assist the Government in the definition of policies
and to provide the basis for the selection of priority projects. As a
result of these efforts, IDA lending increased in FY85 and FY86 and the
proposed Structural Adjustment Credit, the first policy-based IDA
operation in Burundi, was designed.
104.      As of March 31, 1986, Burundi had received one loan and 27
credits, totalling US$248.36 million, of which one loan and 13 credits,
totalling US$82.8 million had been totally disbursed. Agriculture
accounts for 28.2 percent of total commitments; transport, power and
water supply together for about 41.1 percent; and education, local
construction, and mining for the remaining 30.7 percent. Annex II
contains a sumimary statement of IDA credits, and IFC investments.
105.      Country assistance strategy.  IDA's strategy is to continue
to assist the Government in developing and implementing a realistic
medium-term adjustment program while pursuing a long-term development
strategy addressiug the country's structural constraints. Our policy
dialogue will be pursued through a series of Structural Adjustment
Operations. At the same time, IDA vill continue to support long-term
efforts to develop human resources, increase agriculture production,
and develop and maintain infrastructure which will have a significant



- 49 -
long-term impact on production. Priority has been given to the design
and implementation of a program to control population growth. Given
the broad development needs of Burundi and the .Leed to strengthen the
management capacity of the Burundian administration, it is important
that the Bank remain active in the main sectors of the economy.
106.      In the agriculture sector, the projects are geared to
intensify coffee production and quality (Ngozi, Kirimiro Projects),
develop technical packages and extension services to intensify and
diversify fooderop production (planned Agriculture Muyinga, FY87, and
Agricultural Services, FY88), protect and encourage more efficient use
of land (Second Forestry Project, FY86), and improve water supply
(FY86). In human resources, priority is given to the design of a
program to control population growth through a planned Health and
Population Project (FY88), and continuing assistance to primary and
basic secondary education and training (Third and proposed Fourth
Education Projects, FY83 and FY88), as vell as technical assistance to
public sector management (Third and proposed Fourth Technical
Assistance Projects, FY84 and FY87). Under the First Urban Project,
the Bank has helped Government to establish a new urban policy,
including cost recovery, while the recently identified Secondary
Centers Projects vill assist in improving communal organization and
finance, promote artisans, and generate off-farm employment in rural
areas. The Rural Water Supply Preject vill estrblish a new system of
cost recovery for rural vater supply systems.  In the transport and
communications qector, Bank projects vill contribute to lovering the
transportation cost of products to and vithin Burundi and to developing
the communications network, in particular in rural areas (Highways IV
Project, FY85, and Communications Projects, FY80 and proposed for
FY87). Finally, in the energy sector, projects and sector vork are
assisting actions in key areas of forestry sector management, reduction
of the cost of oil imports, and improvement in the pover transmission
network and pover planning (Pover Project, FY86).
107.      Project implementation.  Project performance is, on the
whole, satisfactory. The disbursement rate of 27 percent in FY82-84 is
above the average for countries of the Eastern and Southern Africa
Region. Physical implementation of infrastructure projects or
components (roads, schools, coffee stations, telecommunications) has
been satisfactory. In the productive sectors the record is mixed.
While agricultural projects had significant success in increasing
production and quality of coffee, as vell as forest areas, they had a
limited impact on increasing food crop production because of the
absence of technical packages which could be readily adopted by farmers
and the lack of a coherent policy on agricultural inputs and services.
The DFC project did not succeed in developing a pipeline of small
enterprise projects in the industrial sector, partly due to the veak
management of the development bank. Operation of the glass container
project financed by IFC vas affected by an overvalued exchange rate and
the heavy debt service of the IFC loan, which led to high operating
costs and made it difficult for the products to compete in domestic and
external markets. The lack of success of the fisheries project vas due
to its complexity iu relation to the institutional and management
capacity of the implementing agency.



- 50 -
108.     The impact of IDA projects in institutional development has
been slow but on the whole positive. In some projecta (e.g., coffee),
the presence of an effective technical assistance team led to a
successful project implementation, but it took longer to strengthen the
capacity of the local institutions. In education and
telecomunications projects, the institutional capacity efforts have
been successful, as vas the Third Technical Assistance Project, vhich
strengthened the institutional capacity of the Planning and Agriculture
Ministries. In most cases, IDA-financed projecte have provided a
useful framevork for policy decisions.  For example, discussions under
the education projects led, inter alla, to the adoption of cost savings
and cost-recovery schemes, a more equitable distribution of school
facilities, reorganization of secondary education, and development of
non-formal education for adults. The Urban Project has accomplished
major changes in urban programs over the past several years including
the lifting of rent ceilings and the adoption of cost-recovery schemes.
109.      In addition to the policy dialogue conducted under the SAL,
the FY87 economic work includes a study on employment generation with a
particular foeus on rural areas, a study to assess manpower needs, a
Financial Sector Study, a Transport Sector Study, and a CEM (FY87)
-hich vill assess long-term socio-economic development issues and
prospects, vith emphasis on the agricultural sector. Sector vork la
programmed to cover most sectors as support of our lending operations.
PART VI - RELTIONS VITH THE IMF
110.      Burundi has been a member of the IMF since September 1967,
under Article XIV status. The current quota is SDR 42.7 million.
There are no ongoing stand-by arrangements or special facilities. The
last stand-by vas approved in 1976, and the last special facility
(Compensatory Financing Facility) In 1979. As of January 31, 1986,
Trust Fuad loan disbursements totaled SDR 18.57 million, of which
SDR 12.46 million is outstanding. IMF technical assistance to Burundi
has included experts on foreiga exchange, research, bank supervision
and audits (1982, 1983, and 1984) and analysis of the country's fiscal
system (1984 and 1985). The last Article IV consultation mission took
place March 12-25, 1986. The Government has requested assistance from
the Fund to prepare and implement a stabilization program to cover the
period mid-1986/end-1987, which corresponds to the firat period of the
Goverument's structural adjustment program. Agreement has been
reached as detailed in paras. 23 to 28.
PART VII - RECOMMENDATION
111.      I au satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.



- 51 -
112.      I an also satisfied that the proposed African Facility Credit
would comply with IDA Resolution No. 85-1 adopted on Nay 21, 1985 by
the Executive Directors of the Association.
113.      I recomend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Development Credit and the proposed African Facility Credit and that
the Association vould act as Administrator of the proposed Special
Joint Financing non-reimbursable contributions from Switzerland and
Japan.

GOVERNMENT OF BURUNDI
STATEMENT OF DEVELOPMENT POLICIES
1.        For some time nov, the economy of Burundi has been confronted
vith significant economic and financial imbalances which led to sloving
the rate of growth and causing serious deterioration n the balance of
psyments. Burundi's foreign exchange reserves, whch amounted to
US$104.7 million at the end of 1980, vere depleted to less than
US$30 million at the end of 1985. The country's foreign indebtedness
(outstanding and disbursed) increased over the same period from
US$110 million to US$402 million. While the country has been able to
honor its debt service, and there are no pending external arrears, the
debt service has increased substantially, from 5 percent of exports of
goods and non-factor services in 1980 to 14.4 percent in 1984 and
22 percent in 1985. The overall budgetary deficit increased from
6.5 percent of GDP in 1980 to 12.5 percent in 1983 to decline to
8.4 percent in 1985.
2.        At the end of 1983, the Goverument of Burundi began to take
some adjustment measures. The Burundi franc vas depreciated 30 percent
against the dollar and pegged to the SDR. Producer prices for main
agricultural export crops vere increased from 6 to 50 percent, some tax
rates vere raised, and a strict vage policy vas maintained. The impact
of these measures vas felt in 1984 but only partially. Moreover,
extremely adverse veather conditions led to a decline in agricultural
production which contributed to a 4 percent decline in real GDP. While
agrieultural output reached a normal level in 1985, international
prices for the country's main exports remained loy until the end of the
year. Moreover, the restrictions on imports of intermediary goods have
continued to hinder the activities of the-modern sector and the output
of the industrial sector, currently vorking at low capacity
utilization.
3.        Due to a sudden increase in the coffee prices (folloving the
drought in Brazil at the end of 1985), the country's financial
situation is likely to improve in 1986. Avare that this improvement is
likely to be only temporary and that basic structural distortions vill
lead to a deterioration in the economic and financial situation in the
medium term, the Government has decided to prepare and implement a
structural adjustment program in order to restore the basic economic
and financial equilibria while ensuring a resumption of economic
growth. The Government is aiso avare that this structural adjustment
program cannot succeed unless a serious effort is made to stabilize the
economy, and to this effect has agreed vith the IF on a financial
stabilization program for 1986/1987.
4.        The main economic objectives of the Government relate to
overcoming the current economic difficulties and improving resource
allocation, videning the resource base and making the economy less
dependent on coffee. Given the struceural'characteristics of the



ANNEX IV
- 64 -                       Page 2 of 14
Burundian economy, the structural adjustment program vill take several
years. The period covered by the firet Structural Adjustuent Operation
(SAL) vill be used to start the necessary policy reforme and to put in
place the required institutional framework.
5.        In order to achieve the structural adjustment objective, the
Government has decided to take action on the following areas:
(a) Reform of the incentive structure, including exchange rate,
trade liberalization, and export promotion policies with the
objective to promote export-oriented and efficient import
substitution activities;
(b) Rationalization of the public expenditures program vith the
view to reduce the budgetary deficit, increase the efficiency
of public spending and select a public investment program
compatible with the available resources;
(c) Reforu of the monetary and credit system;
(d) Improvement of external debt management;
(e) Industrial reform aimed at improving the efficiency of the
sector, notably by increasing the private sector role and
eliminating economic distortions;
(f)  Reform of  he public enterp:ises sector, including
rehabilitation, closure and privatization of selected
non-viable enterprises; and
(g) An agriculture policy aimed at increasing volume and quality
of export crops, supported by an institutional framevork
conducive to the optimal utilization of the sector resources.
The timetable for the implementation of the Government's program is
attached.
6.       The Governnent expects that the implementation of such program
vill lead to a substantial improvement in the economic and financial
situation. In particular, real GDP is expected to grow at 3.5 to
4 percent per year. The new incentive structure vould favor a
substantial growth of the private investment, which vould keep gross
capital formation at 18 percent of GDP (in constant 1984 prices),
despite a slowdown in the growth of public investment. Moreover, the
current account deficit of the balance of payments is to remain at
less than 10 percent of GDP and foreign exchange reserves to be kept
above 3 months of import equivalent. The budget deficit would decline
from the average 12 percent of GDP during the last five years, to about
7-8 percent by 1990.
A. Incentive Policies
7.       During the-period 1976-83, the FBu was pegged to the U.S.
dollar at the rate of US$1.00 - FBu 90. In November 1983, the official
exchange rate was pegged to the SDR at the rate of SDR 1  FBu 122.7,
with an implicit devaluation of 30 percent vith respect to the U.S.



- 65 -                      ANNEX IV
Page 3 of 14
dollar.  In 1985, about 80 percent of importe not financed by foreign
aid vere subject to licensing. The remaining 20 percent of importe,
classified as "importa vithout release of fvreign exchange"
(importations sans octroi des devises), vere largely free of
restrictions. About 50 products vere subject to quantitative
restrictions and import bans. With regard to the overall exchange rate
and tariff structure, protection provided to domestic industry vas
excessive, a system which compounded the effects of the regulations on
industrial licensing, and the country's natural protection, leading to
vide variations in effective protection between sectors.
8.        In order to promote effectively the adjustment effort, the
Governuent has decided to adopt a realistic flexible exchange rate, in
the context of the IMF-supported program, vith the objective of
maintaining the real effective exchange rate constant.
9.        The Governuent will undertake significant measures in the
area of trade liberalization. Quantitative import restrictions will be
removed on all but a few luxury consumer products and three categories
of imports competing with local manufactured goods (textiles, glass,
and pharmaceutical products). Import licenses will be granted
automatically. The restrictions on imports of luxury goods vill be
removed before the release of the second SAL tranche. At that time,
the restrictions on the three categories of imports competing vith
local production vould be rewiewed wEth the objective to assess whether
they should be removed. The decree regulating the profession of
importer (No. 10017) vill be amended in order to increase competition
among importers.
10.       The tariff structure vill also be revised at the same time of
the exchange rate reform. The new and simplified tariff structure will
support the country's industrial strategy encouraging export-oriented
industries, and de-emphasizing import dependent industries and ensuring
increased use of domestic inputs on our domestic manufactured
products.  After 1986, ail tariffs will be on an ad-valorem basis vith
a minimum of 15 percent and a maximum of 50 percent (except luxury
consumer goods which vill be subject to a 100 percent tariff and the
products currently included in the ZEP structure). For those
industries with speciai needs for additional protection (e.g., infant
industries) a maximum surcharge of 30 percent vill be added in the
first year and vill be eliminated progressively during a maximum period
of 3 years. The exact amount of this surcharge vill be decided case hy
case. The objective of the reform is to begin establishing a system
more homogenous which vould not discriminate among economic sectors.
11.       Export promotion policies will be pursued.  The Government
has implemented a Customs Drawback system and will provide tax credits
to offset duties on imported inputs purchased locally and used in the
production of exported goods. Export taxes on manufacturing goods will
be abolished, with the exception of re-exports.

Page 4 of 14
B. Public Finance
12.       The overall budgetary deficit (including investment
expenditures of parastatale not self-financed) increased from
6.5 percent of GDP in 1980 to 9 percent in 1985. The deficits were
financed by foreign borrowing is vell as from domestic bank credit.
This imbalance was largely due to an effort to implement the ambitious
development program of the Fourth Development Plan (about FBu 26
billion per year) despite a substantial reduction in coffee revenues.
In the context of the structural adjustment program, the Government's
financial objectives are the following: (i) reduction of the budget
deficit through control of current expenditures, reduction of transfers
and subsidies to parastatals, and limitation of investment
expenditures; (il) adoption of vell defined criteria for project
appraisal; and (iii) strengthening of institutional capacity to manage
the program of public expenditures.
13.       Public spending in 1986 is estimated at FBu 38 billion, of
which FBu 19 billion for current expenditures and FBu 19 billion for
capital expenditures (excluding FBu 1 billion financed by
extra-budgetary resources). The investment prograz vill be financed by
foreign aid (FBu 16 billion) and the remaining by public savings. The
budget deficit will be kept below 2 percent of GDP (compared to
9 percent in 1985) and financed totally by foreign aid. Due to the
improvement in coffee prices, the Covernment intends to use the budget
windfall to repay part of the domestic debt.  This will be possible due
to the control of public expenditures (both recurrent and capital), to
the reform of the transaction tax, to the adjustment in the exchange
rate, and to the improvement in the coffee prices. Moreover, the
reduction in the investment program was made according to strict
investment priorities and projects were retained according to their
socio-economic importance. The Goverament vill continue its efforts to
maintain the budget deficit in 1987 as a low percentage of GDP.
14.       The Government has decided to start in 1987 a unified system
of budget preparat'on which will be used before publishing the Ordinry
and Extraordinary Budgets and vill prepare a comprehensive three-year
program of public expenditures (PEP). The annual budget to be
submitted to the National Assembly vill correspond to the first year of
the PEP. Investuent planning and programming vill be improved as
well.  New guidelines for project appraisal have been prepared by
end-1985 and vill be systematically used by all the ministries for new
projects starting in 1987. The existing planning capacity will be
reinforced to improve the capacity to prepare, appraise and follow-up
development projects.
15.       Concerning the financial flows between the Governuent and the
public enterprises, the Governuent is committed to not subsidizing
those enterprises, unless in cases of non-commercial public enterprises
providing public utility services at a price below cost, and for which
Government's subsidies will be included in the performance contracts to
be agreed between the Government and the enterprise.

Page 5 of 14
C. Monetary Policy
16.       The Government's monetary policy is consistent vith the
stabilization program. It includes a real interest rate policy, a
simplified interest rate structure and soue changes in the system of
credit allocation to increase the autonomy and flexibility of the
banking system. In particular, the Government has decided to increase
the credit ceiling above which commercial banks need authorization from
the Central Bank, from FBu 3 million to FBu 10 million.  This ceiling
vill be adjusted every year to take into account domestic inflation.
For medium- and long-term credits below FBu 10 million, no approval
from the Central Bank vould be needed.
17.       In order to enhance the access of small and medium private
investors to the bank credit, the Government vill reactivate the
Guarantee Fund, which will be managed by a development bank. This Fund
will begin operations with financing from the SAL counterpart funds.
D. External Debt
18.       The Government is concerned with the rapid increase in the
debt service ratio with respect to export revenues and has decided to
borrov only on concessionary terms (in terns of lnterest rate and
maturity) in order to limit that ratio to less than 20 percent of
exports of goods and non-factor services.
E. The Public Investment Progran
19.       The Fourth Development Plan (1983-87) vas planned to involve
expenditures of about FBu 129 billion (in 1984 constant prices) or
about FBu 26 million per annum, over an estimated 460 projects. Of
these, about half vould be for 27 large projects. During the 1983-84
period, actual spending vas much lover than what had been planned:
FBu 19.2 billion in 1983, FBu 17.4 billion in 1984, and FBu 18.3
billion in 1985 (in constant 1984 prices). It has nov become clear
that to reach the proposed f inancial goals in the medium term, the
levels of investment projected for 1986 and 1987 will have to be
reduced.
20.      Preparation of the public investment program vill be made
according to the folloving criteria: (a) it must not lead to a level
of indebtedness that could jeopardize the country's creditworthiness;
(b) a balanced budget must be achieved and recourse to bank financing
reduced to a minimum; and (c) the foreign currency part of the PIP must
be financed through grants or concessionary loans. Moreover, given the
probable fluctuations in the country's available resources, the
Government will define a priority investment program, which vill
include the need for annual financing of each priority project.
Projects having high priority should be assured full funding. Other
projects vith some priority vill be financed only if appropriate



-68-                         ANNEX IV
Page 6 of 14
financing is available.  The core program of the 1986-1987 PIP ls about
FBu 17 billion in 1984 constant prices.  After 1987, these values vill
be reviewed annually taking lnto account the amount of available
resources.
F. Public Enterprises
21.       There are about 60 public enterprises in Burundi which are
engaged in a wide variety of commercial and social activities. A
recent review of the sector has shown that some of these enterprises
are in a serious financial situation and should be closed; and that
others have incurred deficits in recent years. During the last years,
the Government has considerably reduced the financial transfers to
these enterprises and their impact on the budget is therefore reduced.
The Government recognizes that the sector needs to be reorganized and
that an action program should be put in place to make the sector
economically and financially viable.
22.       The problems affecting the sector are the result of (a) poor
management; (b) inadequate price policies; (c) deficient design; and
Cd) unclear relations with the relevant ministries. As stated in the
Policy Statement on the Public Enterprise Sector attached (Annex V),
the rehabilitation program of the Government includes priority actions
concerning the sector at large and specific reforms at the level of
enterprises.
23.       Sectoral Policies.  The Government's objective is to
rehabilitate the sector of public enterprises. No PE vill be created
unless if required by the public interest, if the activities are not
likely to be attractive to the private sector, and if its medium-term
profitability is assured. The Government vill continue its policy of
not subsidizing the PE sector and will extend to it the same advantages
extended to the private sector. The Government has created a Service
in Charge of Public Enterprises (SCEP) whose main attributes include
coordination, follow-up, and assistance to the PEs during the
rehabilitation period. This Service will be managed by a high ranking
public official and vill be assisted by a consulting Committee composed
of representatives of the concerned ministries, the private sector, and
PEs' managers. The legislation on PEs will be reviewed vith the
objective to avoid overlapping of responslbilities and to increase the
autonomy of the PEs and the decision power of their managers. The
Government has also decided to remove all price controls with the
exception of those cases when enterprises provide monopolistic public
services (e.g., vater and electricity). Othervise, all PEs vill be
able to fix their prices freely and to cover their operating costs.
The Government may subsidize those public enterprises pursuing
non-commercial activities of clear public interest. A system of
information/management is being prepared to provide the Governuent with
information on the performance of the overall sector, its Impact on the
economy and budget, and domestic and external debt.



- 69 -                       ANEX IV
Page 7 of 14
24.       Enterprises.  The Governuent has decided to close down four
PEs (AGRIBAL, SUPOBU, SOMEBU, and SOBECOV1/) sad to reintegrate in the
public administration (or subsidize) three PEu. The Government lo
undertaking detailed studies on five of these enterprises (CADEBU,
OTRABU, OTRACO, VERRUNDI, and ONAPHA) vith the objective to
(a) identify in detail the nature of the problems of the enterprises;
and (b) prepare specific rehabilitation plans, which may include
recovery, partial/total privatization or closure. One part of the SAL
counterpart funds vill be used to finance the rehabilitation program of
these enterprises. This fund vill be placed at the National
Development Bank (BNDE) and managed jointly by the SCEP and the BNDE.
Moreover, the Government vill prepare studies for a certain number of
enterprises which vould benefit from enhanced management to develop
their activities in the medium- and long-term and best profit from the
new environment created during the structural adjustment process.
G. Agrieultural Policies
25.       Agriculture is still the major source of income of our
economy. It contributes to 60 percent of GDP and 90 percent of
exports.  Developments in the agricultural sector have been
characterized by a slow grovth of foodcrops, which has hovever
permitted rural "self-sufficiency in food (even if vith some
deficiencies in lipids and protenes). This relatively satisfactory
situation has avoided large importe of foodstuffs sad ls the result of
a remarkable ability of the Burundi farmer to adapt his rudimentary
techniques to increasing demographic pressure as vell as to the absence
of price controls on foodcrope. The Goverument ls avare that the
increasing pressure over limited land is causing a deterioration in
land fertility and soil erosion, and is particularly concerned with the
need to develop adequate packages adapted to the local conditions which
vill be made available to farmers tbrough reinforced agricultural
extension services. This is, however, a lengthy process, and progress
is expected to be slow.
26.       Concerning export crops, notably coff ee, tea and cotton, the
Goverument has developed an action program a-med at increasing both
production and quality. With the help of several foreign donors,
notably the Vorld Bsnk, the European Development Bank and the CCCE
(France), the quality snd production of these crope has improved
already. Avare of the importance of keeping adequate producers'
incentives, the Government has increased the producer prices for coffee
and tea for the campaign of 1986/87, from FBu 125/kg to FBu 160/kg sad
from FBu 15/kg to FBu 18/kg respectively, tbereby mauntaining farmers'
purchasing pover in 1986. A limited survey of consumer revenue and
consumption pattern for selected rural areas vas prepared as a point of
1/  In the context of the liquidation of SOBECOV, comercial activities
vill be liquidated and a governuent agency vould manage storage
facilities.



- 70 -                      ANNEX IV
Page 8 of 14
departure tu fix these prices. A comprehensive strategy for those
crops is being prepared taking into consideration the evolution of the
international prices, the adopted exchange rate policy and the
improvements in the management of the enterprises in charge of the
processing and marketing in the sector.
27.       Coffee sector.  The Government, aware of the fundamental role
of the coffee sector in the economy, has initiated an action program
aimed at improving the quality of exported coffee, its processing and
marketing. This program is explained in detail in the attached Policy
Statement on Agriculture (Annex VI).
28.       Regional Development Companies (RDCs).  The main objectives
of the RDCs include production activities (processing and
commercialization of export crope), support activities (extension,
research and supply of agricultural inputs), and social activities.
The Government is villing to specialize these companies according to
their comparative advantage. In this context, the RDCs' activities
vill concentrate on directly agr4cu1tural production activities, the
other activities being undertaken by specialized central services,
which will be gradually strengthened.
H. Industrial Policies
29.       The Governument's objectives and strategy for the industrial
sector are articulated in the Policy Statement on Trade and Industry
(attached, Annex VII). The incentives structure in industry is
provided by trade and exchange rate policies. At first, the new
environnent created by the SAL will permit an increase of imports of
raw materials and spare parts in order to increase utilization
capacity. In the longer term, there is a need to lncrease the volume
of private investment in those sectors where Burundi may have
comparative advantages. Other measures will be undertaken as vell,
notably the reform of the Investment Code. In order to improve the
sector efficiency and to eliminate the present distorsions, price
controls will be eliminated and both the local producers and importers
vill be able to fix their prices freely. For two strategic products
(oil products and cement) the Government would keep price ceilings; for
another eight products (see Annex VII, Attachment 3), price ceilings
could be established in case of serious shortages, due to exceptional
circumstances, or in case of the development of import monupolies.
These price ceilings vill be eliminated i-i four months.
30.       The public investment program for the industrial sector in
1986 includes only three projects, of which the SOSUMO project is the
only one which is of an important size and new. Concerning this
project, the Governuent is committed (as it happens for the other
public enterprises) to not subsidize the operation costs of the
enterprise and to treat the produced sugar in the same fashion as all
the other local manufactured goods in which concerns tariff
protection. The Government vill use an international company with
exper-ise in sugar production to manage the SOSUMO project. The
Government vill study the feasibility of the project's components for
which no contracts have yet been signed, notably the distillery.

I. Institutional Capacity
31.       To implement the Structural Adjustment Program, the
Government has decided to reinforce its institutional capacity. New
planning units vill be created in some technical ministr!es and others
vill be reinforced, and the Service in Charge of the Public Enterprises
vill be put in place. Moreover, the Ministry of Finance and the
Ministry of Planning will be strengthened in order to enhance the
preparation of the program of public expenditures and to follow-up and
control the execution of the budget.

GOVERNMENT OF BURUNDI
POLICY STATEMENT ON THE PUBLIC ENTERPRISE SECTOR
The Parastatal Sector
1.        The 57 public enterprises (PEs) in Burundi vere established
for the most part in the late 1970s, to perform several functions, such
as to provide a public service, compensate for the lack of private
investment <especially in industry) or coordinate economic sectors
(e.g. coffee and cotton). These PEs today have a considerable impact
on the economy: they account for 10,000 jobs, their revenues were
about FBu 15 billion in 1986, and they contributed about 5% of the
GNP. Their role in the modern sector of the economy is essential.
2.        A difficult world economic situation, problems in domestic
and foreign markets and lack of managerial experience have led to acute
financial problems for certain PEs. Faced vith constraints in public
finance, the Government is avare of the crucial importance of
rehabilitating these enterprises and revitalizing this important
economic sector.
Government Objectives
3.        The Governuent is committed to improving the performance of
the PE sector, and has decided that the PEs in difficulties should be
restructured and rehabilitated, as part of a structural adjustment
program.
4.        In the folloving paragraphs, the term PE includes the three
types of public enterprises in Burundi: public establishments of an
industrial and commercial nature, companies under public law
(entreprises du droit public) and mixed companies.
5.        The Government's main objectives in undertaking this reform
are:
(a) To ensure effective Government participation only in sectors
that require public investment, either because they are new
activities or vital public services, or because they concern
strategic sectors;
(b) To maximize the PEs' contribution to value added. The PEs
must generate a positive economic and financial return. Each
enterprise should be able to cover its operating expenses and
finance at least a part of its investment expenditures; and
(c) To ensure a positive contribution to public finance. The PE
sector must generate an adequate returu to justify the public
investment; the Government will not subsidize the PEs'
commercial and industrial activities.

Page 2 of 6
Rehabilitation Strategy
6.        In order to accomplish these objectives, the Goverument has
adopted a rehabilitation strategy for the PE sector, based on the
folloving main elements:
(a)  Development of well-defined objectives, clear
responsibilities and rigorous accounting procedures, as
needed for the sound management of these enterprises;
(b)  Rehabilitation of selected PEs whose mediumn-term
profitability has been demonstrated on the basit* of
diagnostic and rehabilitation studies; these studies vill
the basis for the negotiation of pexformance contracts
(contrats-plans) between the Government and the enterprises.
(c)  Improvement of PE ma..agement.  This involves:  changes in the
legal status in order to lncrease PE autonomy; reform of the
price controls; development of a management information
system tailored to the needs of the managers; and
introduction of --oductivity bonuses based on performance
criteria to be t blished in agreement vith the Bank and
with the Bank's support;
(d)  Redimensioning the parapublic sector through privatization,
-hen operations could be adequately handled by private
investors or through closure when the activities are not
profitable over the medium run;
(e)  Establishment of ways to enable the Government to regularly
obtain a clear picture of the performance of the sector as a
whole and to follow up on the progress of main enterprises;
(f)  Limitation of the establishment of new PEs and of large
investments to those cases when economic profitability is
demonstrated and where the alternative of having the private
sector to make such investment is not possible; and
(g)  Budget financing of PEs' social objectives, whern these are
imposed by the State and when their cost cannot be recovered
from the users.
Action Program
7.        To achieve these otjectives, the Goverument intends to
implement a reform program based on past experience and on ongoing
studies.  Priority actions and follow-up measures vill be taken for the
sector as a whole and for individual enterprises.

Priority Measures
Sector policy:
8.        The Governument has decided to create a unit in the public
administration responsible for permanent strategic analysis, follow-up
and assistance of the PE sector. This National Service in Charge of
Public Enterprises (Service national charg des entreprises publiques -
SCEP), headed by a high-ranking official, vill be responsible for
coordinating the rehabilitation program.
9.        The SCEP vill study the legal framework of the PE sector and
make recomnendations as needed. The goal is to adapt the existing
legislation to the changes that have occurred in the sector over time
or that will occur as part of the rehabilitation program. The roles of
the supervisory ministries, Directors General, Boards of Directors and
Managing Committees of each enterprise vill be reviewed in order to:
(i) avoid overlapping of responsibilities and conflicts of authority;
(ii) decentralize authority to the extent possible; snd (iii) give PE
managers as much responsibility as possible. The legal framework vill
take into account the necessary reforme in employment policy, notably
regarding compensation, hiring and termination. These reforms vill
take into consideration the existing Labor Code.
10.       The Government vill relax the price controls for PE services
and products, to bring them in line vith the private sector. To the
extent possible, the prices charged for public services vill reflect
the cost of production; the prices of manufactured products vill be
determined by market forces. If certain public non-coumercial services
are to be provided at prices below cost, adequate subsidies vill be
included in the performance contract and the necessary funds vill be
included in the Governuent budget.
11.       A management information system (MIS) vill be set up to
collect data on production, personnel, sales, inventory and the
finances of the PEs. The first objective of this system will be to
enable the management of each enterprise to improve its performance
analysis. Each enterprise vill participate fully in the development of
the MIS. A periodic performance chart (tableau de bord) vill also be
introduced to follow up on the impact of the parapublic sector on
publie finance and other economic variables such as the balance of
payments and domestic and external debt.
Enterprises
12.       The SCEP vill make detailed studies of enterprises in order
to determine the types of reform required. These studies vill
establish the desirability of privatization, closure or technical and
financial recovery of the enterprise. The studies vill be made for
given subsectors or individual enterprises. In the first phase, a
diagnostic study wll be made of the enterprise (where one has not been



- 80 -                      ANNEX V
Page 4 of 6
made recently), making it possible to identify strategie options and
implement an urgent action plan. In the second phase, a rehabilitation
program and an action plan will be prepared. The action plan vill
include a contract plan, a privatization or liquidation program or any
other plan to resolve the probleme of the enterprise, as appropriate.
13.       The Go-ernment intends to reorient the following enterprises
<or subsectors):
14.       Reintegration or subsidization of enterprises of
socioeconomic significance but whose financial prospects are poor:
Enterprise                     Subsector
CPI                            Studies
LAPHAVET (laboratory)          Veterinary pharmaceutical
laboratory
ONT                            Promotion of tourism
15.       Closing down of unprofitable enterprises that are not vital
to the public sector:
Enterprise                     Subsector
AGRIBAL                        Agricultural development
SUPO'1U                        Fishery
SOMEL-U                        Studies
SOBECaV                        Warehousing/trade
16.       The enterprises to be rehabilitated in priority by SCEP (in
accordance vith action plans to be defined) are the folloving:
Enterprise                     Subsector
CADEBU                         Savings association
ONAPHA                         Pharmaceutical products
OTRABU                         Road transportation
OTRACO                         Urban transportation
VERRUNDI                       Glass factory
17.       For other selected PEs, the SCEP vill formulate (with
support from the Bank; a rehabilitation and support program to be
submitted for Government's approval. Special emphasis vill be placed
on the trade and tourism subsectors. The criteria for selecting the
enterprises to be studied for rehabilitation vill include the folloving
factors:  eize (financial and number of jobs involved); negative cash
flow, other negative financial indicators; specific management
problems; and activities of possible interest to the private sector.



-81 -                          ANNEX V
Page 5 of 6
18.       If necessary, the SCEP vill make strategic planning stu4ies
for the following large enterprises:
Enterprise                    Subsector
BCC                           Coffee
COGERCO                       Cotton
COTEBU                        Textiles
OCIBU                         Coffee
ONATEL                        Telecommunications
OTB                           Tea
These studies will use as basic information all previous
studies on these enterprises.
Supplementary Neasures
Sector Policy
19.       The autonomy of PE management will be strengthened by
performance contracts reflecting the objectives agreed by the
enterprise with the Government; a posteriori monitoring will be
emphasized.
20.       This autonomy of management will include, but not be limited
to, the folloving aspects: hiring of personnel which vill be lef t to
the managers of each enterprise; setting of a salary scale for each
enterprise, approved by its Board of Directors and after discussion
vith the SCEP; introduction of productivity bonuses according to a
system still to be defined; reducing unnecessary staff; and allocation
of net profits to reserves, investment or dividends.
21.       No new PEs will be established unless:  (i) they are required
for the public good; (ii) the activity has limited appeal for private
investors; and (iil) medium-term profitability is acceptable.
Feasibility studies vill be made and vill take into account these
criteria. Prior to any major investment in a PE, the Government vill
study the possibility that such an investment be carried out by the
private sector.
22.       The State vill support only projects whose public utility has
been deLonstrated and whose return is deemed adequate on the basis of a
feasibility study. In these cases the State support will be stated
in a contract plan. The State vill make it clear that there is no
implicit guarantee.
Enterprises
23.       The performance contract to be prepared for each enterprise
selected for rehabilitation or strategic planning will include the
specific objectives of the enterprise, the strategy to be adopted, an
evaluation of costs and multi-year targets for results of operations,
type of government monitoring and the degree of enterprise autonomy,



- 82 -                      ANNEX V
Page 6 of 6
amount of resources contributed by the State, and a system of
productivity bonuses based performance criteria appropriate for the
activity in question.
24.       The Government vill restructure the financial bases of
certain enterprises deficient in that reopect, through an lncrease in
authorized capital. This vill make it possible to lower the
debt-equity ratio and guarantee longer-term financial viability.
25.       The Government vill establish an Intervention Fund to finance
the rehabilitation of selected PEs. This Fund vill be financed through
the counterpart funds from the SAL and placed at the BNDE (National
Bank for Economic Development). The Fund's operations vill be based on
an action plan drawn up for each enterprise. The Fund vill be able to
finance various types of activities, including rehabilitation
investments, purchase of parts or raw materials, training or retraining
of personnel, technical assistance and increases in the enterprise
working capital. The Fund vill disburse in the form of equity or
loans.
26.       The Government vill ensure that cross debts between PEs and
between the PEs and the State are canceled.

GOVERNMENT OF BURUNDI
POLICY STATEMENT ON AGRICULTURE
Agriculture Sector
1.        The agriculture sector is the basis of Burundi's economy,
accounting for 60Z of GDP and 90% of export revenues. In recent years,
tie objectives of the Government have been to maintain food
aelf-sufficiency, increase export receipte and develop the rural sector
through the regional development companies (RDCs).
2.        In general, the food crop sector has made satisfactory
progress and Burundi has been able to remain food self-sufficient.
However, the food balance remains precarious oving to demographic
pressure, which leads to more intensive cropping and lover saoil
fertility.
3.        For export crops, the Government has followed a policy aimed
at improving the coffee quality by investing in vashing stations and
processing plants and improving research and extension services.
Efforts to develop tea-groving have had very positive results in terms
of both quality and quantity of exports. For cotton, the Government
has managed to stem the decline in production and since 1982 results
have been very encouraging.
4.        The RDCs have had to play in the past a multiple role:
productive agricultural activities (processing and marketing of export
crops), support activities (extension, research and inputs
distribution) and social activities. Experience to date shows that
although the RDCs have a comparative advantage for processing and
marketing, their agricultural and social services have not achieved the
expected results, given their cost. In view of the current financial
constraints, a less costly structure for agricultural support services
should be sought.
Goverument Objectives
5.        As regards food crops, the Government's objective is to
maintain food self-sufficiency in the face of population growth, while
taking into account the country's overall agricultural resources and
their comparative advantage.
6.        As regards export crops, the Goverument plans to implement
incentive policies (including producer prices and marketing) that vill
maintain the producer purchasing pover and aim at getting a better
price on external markets. For coffee, this policy will depend on
evolution of the international market. For tea, efforts vill involve
increasing production and maintaining high quaiity.  In view of the
variations in international prices for coffee and tea and their impact
on public finances and the agriculture sector, the Governuent vill
encourage diversification of export products.



- 84 -                      ANNEX VI
Page 2 of 3
7.        The Government vill continue its efforts to strengthen the
institutional framework for the implementation or formulation of
required policies and maximization of the impact of resources allocated
to the sector. In this respect, the Government has decided to
strengthen the complementarity of the functions of the RDCs and of the
national services of the Ministries of Agriculture and Livestock and of
Rural Development at the central, regional and community levels,
particularly to reduce RDC operating costs and gradually replace
external financing vith budgetary financing of agricultural services
and self-financing for productive and commercial activities.
Action Program
Produc    -ices
8.        Food crupa.  The Government *ill continue its
non-interventionist policy concerning prices of food crops.
9.        Export crops.  In order to maintain producer prices constant
in real terms, the Government set the 1986 producer price at FBu 18/kg
for tea and FBu 160/kg for cGffee, yielding an increase in real terms.
10.       A study vill be made vith a vlew to proposing a mechanism to
determine producer prices at a level which provides sufficient
incentives taking into account price fluctuations on the international
market. This srudy vill also analyze current policies for subsidizing
agricultural inputs and make proposals on whether they should be
continued or eliminated. Prices and subsidies for the 1987-88 crop
year vill be set on the basis of that study.
Caffee
11.    As part of a study financed by the Governaent, consultants
made recommendations on improving the quality and marketing of coffee.
These recommendations vere discussed by the Government and the Bank.
The Government adopted the following action program:
(a)  Introduction of measures to reduce progressively the moisture
content of coffee;
(b) Preparation of a global strategy for the coffee sector to
enabLe the definition of medium- and long-term policies could
be designed, aimed at maximizing export revenues, by means of
increased production and quality. This strategy would be
based on analyses of: the count&-y's production potential (in
quality alnd quantity terms); perspectives and fluctuations of
the international coffee market; efficiency improvement of
the intervening agents in the production and marketing
processes; and producer prices.

Institutions
12.       As regards the RDCs, lt is clear that they cannot undertake
the multiple functions entrusted to them in a coat-effective manner.
They vill accordingly concentrate on productive and comercial
activities. Concurrent wlth this reduction of RDC responsibilities and
structure, the national offices of the Ministry of Agriculture and
Livestock vill be progressively strengthened s0 that they will be able
to gradually assume primary responsibility for research and extension,
in addition to the monitoring and collection of statistica and project
planning and preparation that they currently carry out.

GOVERNMENT OF BURUNDI
POLICY STATEMENT ON TRADE AND INDUSTRY
A.        Trade Policy
1.        Burundi's trade balance is characterized by a structural
deficit which leads to a deficit of the balance of the current
account. To cope with this disequilibrium, the Goverument has
introduced a system of import licensing and controls on foreign
exchange transfers. The foreign exchange control has been more or less
rigorous depending on the availability of foreign exchange. In the
context of the SAL, the Government has decided to reorient its trade
policy and rely more actively on the market mechanisms by:
(1) pursuing an appropriate exchange rate policy; (iI) liberalizing
imports and prices; and (iI) introducing a new tariff structure.
2.        The Governuent recognizes that the present import licensing
system instaured to cope with the shortage of foreign exchange has
weakened economic competitiveness and generated import rents. The
Government has decided to remedy this situation and gradually
liberalize imports.
3.        In the first phase, the liberalization would cover the
essential products, raw materials, spare parts, capital goods and
imports competing with locally produced goods, vith a view to stimulate
local producers to raduce costs and increase efficiency. Only three
groupe of imports competing with domestically produced goods (cotton,
glass and pharmaceuticals) vill remain temporarilly under licensing.
This will be reviewed at the time of the SAC second tranche release.
4.        In a second phase, the liberalization would be extended to
the luxury goode (Attachment 1). The timetable for this process is
given in para. 24.
5.        Burundi's tariff structure includes:
-    An import duty;
-    A fiscal duty; and
-    A statistical tax.
6.        This structure has undergone nulerous changes over tlme,
occasionally on a piecemeal basis, which have eroded its own coherence
and hindered its Impact on basic objectives (protection of economic
sectors and the generation of public revenues).
7.        The Government has decided to reform this tariff structure sc
that it can pursue consistently and fairly the twin objectives of
revenue generation and rational protection of national production.
8.        The Goverument vanta to use the customs tariff (together vith
the exchange rate) as the only instrument of trade policy while
continuing to generate budget revenues during the reform period. To



ANNEX VII
- 88 -                        Page 2 of 8
achieve these objectives, the Government has decided to simplify the
tariff structure and gradually correct the existing economic
distortions.
To this end:
(1)    The import and fiscal duties vill be consolidated into a
single duty;
(2)    The statistical tax will be kept at its current level of 4%;
and
(3)    The number and range of tax rates vill be reduced, as
follows:
1986
Category                            (start)   1987    1988   1989
(in percentage)
Luxury Goods                          100       100     100    100
Finished Manufactured Products         50        45      40     40
Food Products                          25        25      25     25
Primary and Intermediate Goods         15        20      25     30
Essential and Capital Goods            15        20      20     20
Government Imports                              Exempted*
* See Attachment 2 for list of products to be exempted.
9.        The Government will also establish procedures for introducing
import surcharges in cases where additional protection is needed
(infant industries). These surcharges vill be a maximum of 30 percent
over a three-year period at most, according to the case and need.
These surcharges vill be used to protect existing operations that are
financially viable over the medium term.
10.       The formal procedures regulating the use of import surcharges
vill be designed s0 that the Tariff Commission vill decide on a
case-by-case basis on the need for, and the amount and duration of, the
surcharge.
11.       Before making the reforms scheduled for 1987, the Goverxment
vill assess the impact of the new tariff structure on the budget.
Aside from luxury goods, the objective is to arrive at a narrover
tariff band of 20 to 40 percent, essentially on an ad valorem basis,
vith an equivalent tax rate for products of the same nature or used for
the same purpose.
12.       Luxury goods would be dealt with separately as the Covernuent
feels it is not desirable to encourage consumption patterns t'aat are
incompatible with the population's income levels.

BURUNDI
POLICY STATEMENT ON PUBLIC EXPENDITURE MANAGEMENT
1.       One of the objectives of the Government's structural adjustment
program is to improve the efficiency of the public sector resources,
including public enterprises and public expenditure program. The action
plan for the public enterprise sector has been spelled out in the Policy
Statement on Public Enterprises. The present statement deals with the
action program envisaged for the management of the public expenditure
program.
Objective
2.       In the recent years, Burundi's public finance situation has been
characterized by considerable fluctuations in revenues (heavily dependent
on coffee) and an ambitious investment program. This situation has led to
serious budgetary deficits, excessive use of central bank financing,
growing external debt and consequent increase in debt service. While some
measures have been taken in the past few years their effect has been
partial and the Governnent is aware of the need to implement a coherent
program to control public expenditures to a level compatible with resource
availabilities and stabilization needs, and to increase the efficiency
of public spending. With this objective, policy action will be taken on
the following areas: (a) budgetary reform; (b> project preparation and
selection; and (c) strengthening of budget-planning capacity.
Bud_etary Reform
3.       The present budgetary system is composed of two budgets: the
ordinary budget (BO) and the extraordinarylinvestment budget (BEI). The
bulk of the tax and non-tax (administrative) revenues are affected to the
BO to finance recurrent expenditures and repayment of public debt. The BEI
is allocated special taxes from coffee and beer, dividends from the
parastatals and a fixed amount of central Bank financing (FBU 2 billion)
included in the BEI as regular annual revenue. The BEI finances mostly
capital expenditures (including counterpart funds for projects financed by
foreign aid), and some other items, such as exceptional contributions to
regional organizations, and some payments of arrears.  Investment
expenditures financed by foreign aid are not shown in either budget.
Preparation of the BO is the responsibility of the Ministry of Finance; the
BEI is prepared by the Ministry of Planning. The Ministry of Finance is
responsible for the execution of both budgets.
4.       This system has several drawbacks for an efficient management of
the public expenditures program. In particular, it does not include the
expenditures financed by foreign aid (loans and grants), and no provisions
are made for recurrent expenditures associated with investment projects.
Moreover, the separated allocation of resources to each budget, and the
classification of banking financing as revenue of the BEI distort the
public finance picture making it difficult for the Government to obtain a



ANNEX VIII
Page 2 of 5
- 96 -
global view of its expenditure program, to program investment expenditures
as a function of public savings, and to adjust the expenditure program to
fluctuations of revenues. Moreover, the requirements of on-going and new
projects in terms of recurrent expenditures are not systematically
prograuned.
5.       To make the budget an efficient tool of macro-economic management,
the Government intends to implement the following reforms during 1986:
(a) adoption of an unified system of budget preparation (before
publishing the BO and BE) with clear separation of current
revenues, current expenditures (excluding repayments of debt),
identification of current balance and capital expenditures
financed both from the budget and foreign aid. Disbursements
of domestic and foreign loans (net of repayments) will be
classified as deficit financing items. Capital grants will be
classified as government revenues. Public revenues would not
be affected to any particular part of the program, with the
possible exception of some Funds which have been temporarily
set for operational purposes (i.e. Road Fund);
(b) a comprehensive three-year public expenditures program (PEP)
for 1987-89 will be prepared including for each budgetary
category (executing agency) recurrent and capital
expenditures. This vould permit a better planning and
programming of resources to finance central administration
expenditures, social services, maintenance of the State fixed
assets, and future recurrent expenditures associated with cn-
going and new investment projects. The annual budget to be
presented to the National Assembly vould correspond to the
first year of the three- year budget, but would include only
revenues accruing from local sources and expenditures financed
by domestic revenues (e.g. foreign aid financed expenditures
vould not be included in the Budget Law to be submitted to the
National Assembly);
(c) the public investment program would include a "core' program
of projects of highest priority for which full funding would
be assured. A non-core (stand-by) program would be
simultaneously prepared; this would be financed if additional
resources became available. The core projects would be those
with the highest rate of return and reflect the development
priorities of the Government in terms of inter-sectorial
allocation. All projects above US$3 million would be subject
to feasibility studies (prepared by the Government or donors)
according to guidelines provided by the Government. Those
feasibility analyses vould be discussed with the technical
ministries to ensure that the Government's priorities and
criteria are taken into account in selecting development
projects.
(d) in establishing the level of the investment program the
Government will attend to the following aspects: (i) it must



ANNEX VIII
Page 3 of 5
- 97 -
not lead to a level of indebtedness that could jeopardize the
country's creditworthiness; (ii) should be consistent with a
balanced budget and need minimal bank cred't; (iii) its
foreign currency part would be financed through grants or
concessional loans.
Prolect Appraisal Guidelines
6.       At present, the largest investment projects in Burundi have been
appraised by foreign donors and consultants using often different criteria
and basic parameters. The Gover.,ment intends to follow closely the
preparatory work of large projects and will enhance the capacity of the
Ministry of Planning to carry out appraisal work for smaller projects in
consultation with the technical ministries.  In this process, common
criteria and guidelines vill be used, including the use of standard
cost/benefit analysis (whenever possible) and relevant parameters which
have been developed and reflect the specific conditions of Burundi. These
guidelines will be used by all ministries in preparing and appraising the
projects to be submitted for financing.
7.       The following guidelines will be used:
(a) for directly productive sectors (agriculture, industry,
mining, etc..) whose output is marketed and whose price _an be
used as a proxy to measure its economic value (after necessary
adjustments), projects will be selected using standard cost-
benefit analysis. (A detailed manual of project appraisal
would be prepared to be used by local officials.) In these
cases, only projects with an economic rate of return above 10
percent and a social rate of return high2r than 7 percent
(using public revenues at border prices as numeraire) would be
retained and considered for financing.
(b) for infrastructure projects, i.e. energy, water supply, and
other infrastructure projects for which there are alternative
technological configurations for the same stream of benefits
(e.g. the supply of electric power, based on hydro or termic
resources) projects will be selected on the basis of the least
cost solution criteria. That is, the internal rate of return
would be the discount rate at which the discounted cost of the
alternative projects is the same. The retained project would
have an economic rate of return above 10 percent and a social
rate of return above 7 percent. The Governnent would ensure
that all these projects would be financially viable, and that
the final users would pay for the services provided (cost
recovery);
(c) for social projects (education, health), projects would be
selected taking into account their relative cost, social
coverage, and using international indices (e.g. cost per
student, cost per hospital bed, etc.) as a basis to evaluate
the adequacy of the proposed project.

8.       Attached is the list of basic parameters to be used to convert
domestic price:; into border prices, as required for project appraisal.
Those coefficients were estimated in mid-1985 and will be updated once a
year on the basis of statistical information collected by the national
service of economic statistics, the Ministry of Planning and the technical
ministries.
Institutional caPacity
9.       To support the implementation of these reforms, the present
institutional capacity would be reinforced at severai levels. The
Government intends to reinforce the services of the Ministries of Finance
and of Planning in charge of the preparation and follow up of the annual
budget in order to make it possible the adoption of an unifJed budget, the
preparation of a three-year public expenditure program, and the improvement
of the public accounting system (namely by adopting a double-entry
accounting system). The Government would request technical assistance from
the IMF on public finance accounting.
10.      Concerning the services in charge of planning and programming,
the Government has recruited a consultant for two-years to help establish
a system of follow-up of prcJect implementation. To improve the capacity
of project selection, s' improve the efficiency of the public investment
program the governm'.:nt will. create a project preparation unit in the
Ministry of Plannin,x wit' satellite units in the major technical
ministries. The government will hire an expert on project preparation and
appraisal for two years to assist the new units and the central project
unit in the Ministry of Planning.
