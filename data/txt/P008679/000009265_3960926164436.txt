MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO BANCO DE FOMENTO NACIONAL
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE REPUBLIC OF PORTUGAL
FOR A THIRD INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendations on a proposed loan of
US$60.0 million equivalent to BFN on standard Bank terms is submitted for
approval. The loan would assist in financing ongoing industrial development,
a pilot industrial restructuring program, and institutional development of
BFN.
2.       Background.  Industry accounts for 40 percent of GDP and employs
about 35 percent of the active population in Portugal. The main subsector is
textiles and clothing (40 percent of total value added and 27.7 percent of
total employment in manufacturing). Other key subsectors are wood and cork,
pulp/paper, metallurgy, chemicals and engineering. Textiles and clothing,
wood and cork, pulp/paper and chemicals are also Portugal's major
export-oriented industries. Industrial production expanded by around 4.5
percent during 1985 followed by 5.3 percent during 1986 - the best
performance since 1980, following a period of virtual stagnation from 1981 to
1984. Manufacturing exports have performed very well, especially in the
beverages, textiles, pulp and chemical subsectors, in which Portugal is most
competitive. Despite a more liberal trading policy in recent years, the
industrial secto. retains many of the traits built up during decades of
intense protectionism and over-reliance on captive domestic and colonial
markets. Most subsectors still lean heavily toward small- and medium-scale
industries (SMI) characterized by conservative, family-style ownership,
relatively weak management, low-grade technology, and a limited awareness of
both the dangers and opportunities involved in more active participation in
the international economy. Adjustment problems of individual enterprises
have been exacerbated by both the financial difficulties following the
revolutionary period and the restricted rature of Portugal's labor and
capital markets. Because of fifty years of direct management by Government
and the slow rate of adaptation to indirect economic management, there is no
institutional base to support independent, market-oriented restructuring
efforts of individual enterprises. BFN, with its large industrial portfolio
and relatively well developed professional staff, is well suited to
contribute to developing such a base. Ministry of Industry and Energy (MIE)
and the Industry Associations have agreed, in conjunction with the proposed
project, to be actively involved in this effort.
3.      Project Objectives.  The proposed project would continue support to
industrial development in Portugal through investment financing by BFN and to
build a viable mechanism to promote needed industrial restructuring in the
context of Portugal's membership in the European Community (EC). A pilot
program to develop subsector restructuring strategies as a basis for
corporate restructuring investments is proposed as the main thrust. The
project would also support further institutional development of BFN in three
areas: Management Information Systems (MIS); internal audit capability; and
industrial restructuring capacity.



-2-
4.       Proiect Description.  The proposed project would have two major
components: (i) a line-of-credit in the amount of US$55 million to meet the
long-term foreign exchange needs of medium sized investments in mixed and
private sector enterprises, including those identified throttgh the two pilot
subsector restructuring studies funded under the technical assistance
component of the proposed project; and (ii) a technical assistance component
of US$5.0 million to provide consultancy services to finance the foreign
exchange cost of: (a) two subsector restructuring studies of the white clay
ceramics and wood and wood furnitLre subsectors (US$1.0 million); and (b)
institutional development assistance to BFN at a cost of US$4.0 million
consisting of a study to develop an MIS (US$l..3 million) and the installation
of the Financial Information System (FIS) part of the MIS (US$2.7 million).
To meet the resource needs of BFN's existing project pipeline and to permit an
early start of the two restructuring studies, retroactive financing of up to
US$5 million would be made available for related expenditures incurred after
June 1, 1987. The total project cost is estimated to be about US$144 million,
with a foreign exchange content of US$60 million (42%). A breakdown of costs
and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of
procurement and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A
timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group
operatiovs in Portugal are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. The
Staff Appraisal Report, No. 6911-PO dated December 22, 1987, is also attached.
5.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  Bank strategy has been to assist
Portugal in adjusting its economic and industrial policies to prepare for
membership in the EC. The Bank has accordingly provided policy advice to the
Government in the context of its ongoing program for economic liberalization
for a number of years. The Bank has also supportod the development and
modernization of Portuguese industry through two earlier loans to BFN and a
loan for the development of SMIs which was channelled through commercial
banks. The proposed project would continue this strategy as the process of
economic adjustment and industrial restructuring will need to continue. In
respect of industrial restructuring, the Bank's experience acquired through
supporting similar efforts in other countries in the region would be
particularly useful in the development of viable, long-run subsector and
corporate strategies for restructuring, particularly where enterprises might
not be expected to devise solutions on their own. While the studies would
cover a small segment of Portugal's overall manufacturing industry, they
protise a potentially substantial payoff through a demonstration effect. As
pilot efforts, they represent a significant step in the right direction in
accordance with Government's current industrial policy.
6.       Actions Agreed.  (i) The Government would continue its current
policies of maintaining real positive interest rates and the current basis for
determining agreed foreign exchange risk premia in case of the BFN loans; (ii)
The Government would continue its current policy of settling outstanding
public sector enterprise arrears to BFN in a timely and satisfactory manner;
(iii) The Government and BFN would undertake the two proposed subsector
studies under agreed terms of reference and arringements acceptable to the
Bank: contractual arrangements for the first study have already been
completed; the second study will begin about six months after completion



- 3-
of the first study. Both studies will incorporate follow-up programs with
on-the-job training for BFN staff to identify and design enterprise specific
restructuring investments on a cost-recovery basis; (iv) BFN would apply
appropriate onlending terms including a variable interest rate which is
positive in real terms; (v) BFN's subproject appraisal would include an
assessment of the effect of the subproject investment on the environment. BFN
will obtain an undertaking that each subproject will be des:gned and operated
in compliance with Portuguese environmental protection legislation which is
acceptable; (vi) BFN has also contracted for an MIS study and would implement
its fiaancial information component by December 31, 1990. BFN has
s(Lengthened its internal aidit staff and undertaken to maintain fully staffed
the position of accountant/auditor in the Internal Audit Department; (vii) BFN
would maintain a debt/equity ratio not exceeding 10:1; and (viii) BFN would
eliminate all arrears of principal and interest which existed as of December
31, 1986, by 1991 in line with an agreed timetable.
7.       Justification.  The project's primar7 direct benefit will be the
further development of private sector industry, leading to higher output and
employment levels. Successful implementation of the industrial restructuring
component in two subsectors will provide a valuable demonstration effect and
should create additional demand for such studies and investments. Technical
assistance to BFN will strengthen both its internal operations and its
capacity to support industrial restructuring. Strengthening the latter will
also increase BFN's ability to provide capital market services. These
developments will enhance BFN's competitiveness within the Portuguese banking
industry.
8.       Project Risks.  The principal risk facing the project is the
possibility of a decline in private secvor investment due to macroeconomic
factors, and a possible decline in private sector industry competitiveness due
to excessive wage cost increase. The Government is well aware of these issues
and has so far dealt successfully with them. Another risk is the possibility
of inadequate follow-up to the pilot restructuring strategy studies. Careful
consideration was given to this risk in the design of the component,
particularly in terms of ensuting a corporate focus from the outset and in
providing an immediate follow-up service. A major factor in reducing the
risks associated with the project is the commitment and active involvement of
MIE, BFN, and the concerned industry associations.
9.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
