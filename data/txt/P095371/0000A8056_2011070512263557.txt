                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Although the project objectives remained valid, they are unlikely to be achieved; thus it was considered best not to extend the project. In light of the new post-earthquake
                         circumstances and the recent election of a new government, the Bank will explore other options for providing support for economic governance, which is an important priority in Haiti.
