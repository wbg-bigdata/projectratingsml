A: Project Development Objective
1. Project development objective and key performance indicators:
Background: Northeast Brazil has long contained the largest concentration of rural poor in Latin America. In a
search for sustainable solutions to this problem, the Government of Brazil and the Bank have partnered in research
and analytical work, technical assistance and a wide variety of development projects for several decades. Some of the
most promising results in the area of rural development began to be observed in the late 1980s/early 1990s, under a set
of small community-driven development (CDD) pilot components of larger projects (Northeast Rural Development
Project, NRDP). When evaluation showed that these pilots were successfully getting resources directly to organized
community associations, with greater impact, cost-effectiveness and prospects for sustainability, it was decided in
1993 to completely reformulate the overall projects, using the pilot CDD components as the template. Under the
reformulated projects (R-NRDP), the poorest communities received financing to implement, manage and maintain
investment subprojects and to contract technical assistance directly as needed. The Federal Government withdrew
from its earlier role as coordinator and provider of counterpart funding, decentralizing these responsibilities to the
Northeast states. The states in tum piloted a new mechanism to further decentralize decision-making and engage local
governments, by creating independent representative project Municipal Councils for purposes of project resource
allocation. As the R-NRDPs closed, they were replaced by a set of Rural Poverty Alleviation Projects (RPAPs, 1995-
present), for which the state governments borrowed the loans directly. Following the strategy of continuous piloting,
testing and expansion, the RPAPs mainstreamed the Municipal Councils and introduced a new variant which assigned
not only resource allocation decisions but also funds management to selected high-performing Councils.
To date, the combined impact of these two sets of projects (R-NRDPs and RPAPs) has been to successfully finance
and implement over 50,000 infrastructure, productive and social investments, reaching some 7.5 million of the poorest
rural people (out of a rural population of 16.5 million) with at least one subproject, in over 30,000 separate
communities in the rural Northeast. At least as important, they have succeeded in decentralizing decision-making
over project resources to State and local levels, and beginning to increase the role and influence of rural communities
in local planning and development. As the RPAPs draw to a close, the Federal and Northeast State governments have
decided to consolidate and further scale up the CDD concept through a new set of operations that together will
comprise the Brazil Rural Poverty Reduction Program (RPRP). Besides improving the well-being of a much larger
number of rural communities through better access to essential infrastructure and services, the main contribution of
the RPRP will be to test strategies to extend the reach of the Municipal Councils, by progressively involving them in
proactively seeking funding and participating in priority-setting and decision-making on resource allocation over a
much wider range of Federal, State and local programs. Currently, a large share of the resources available under those
programs either do not reach the rural poor, are directed to activities that are not among the highest priorities of the
beneficiaries, or are not delivered in a cost-effective manner. If the RPRP is successful, it will help to realign and
better integrate these programs, greatly leveraging the overall impact of public resources directed towards rural
poverty reduction. The new program will further help to graduate communities from matching grants to financial
institutions, and will expand ongoing, successful piloting of the use of information technology to increase
transparency and to connect communities directly with markets.
As part of its efforts to reduce poverty, the Federal Government has agreed to support the RPRP in the Northeast
region and is also considering extending the approach to other states with a high incidence of rural poverty.
Specifically, the Federal Government is agreeing on aggregate borrowing amounts which it will guarantee for each
state, with half to be borrowed in an initial project and the balance for a second stage operation after successful
completion of the first. The proposed loan to Bahia would support that state's initial RPRP project. The Govermnent
is also requesting Bank support at this time for similar projects in Ceara, Pernambuco and Piaui (presented separately).
It expects to do the same over the next year for initial RPRP projects in other states (in the Northeast and in other
regions where it decides to extend the program), and then subsequently for the second phase of the program in states
which have demonstrated successful performance.
Project development objectives: The project aims to assist the State of Bahia to reduce currently high levels of rural
poverty by:  (a) improving well-being and incomes of the rural poor through better access to basic social and
economic infrastructure and services and support for productive activities, using proven community-driven
development (CDD) techniques; (b) increasing the social capital of rural communities to organize collectively to meet
own needs; (c) enhancing local governance by greater citizen participation and transparency in decision-making,



Page 3
through creation and strengthening of community associations and Municipal Councils; and (d) fostering closer
integration of development policies, programs and projects at the local level, by assisting Municipal Councils to
extend their role in seeking funding, priority-setting and decision-making over resource allocation.
Key performance indicators:
*  number of families benefited from subproject investments;
*  incremental employment generated from subproject investments;
*  increase in well-being and incomes of project beneficiaries;
*  increase in social welfare of rural communities;
*  increase in social capital index (CPI) of project Municipal Councils;
*  number of Municipal Councils participating in priority-setting and decision-making on resource
allocation of project and non-project funded development activities;
*  increase in total project and non-project financing allocated through Municipal Council mechanism; and
*  number of communities graduated from the program.
B: Strategic Context
1. Sector-related Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) goals supported by the project (see Annex 1):
CAS document number: 22116-BR                Date of latest CAS Progress Report discussion: May 24,2001
The project is an essential component of the current Bank Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Brazil, which
identifies the reduction of poverty and inequality as the central objective of the Bank's assistance efforts. The
Northeast region, which includes the State of Bahia where the proposed project will be implemented, is home to the
largest concentration of rural poor in the country. To achieve strong, sustainable poverty reduction impacts, the CAS
recommends well targeted anti-poverty programs to enhance the human and physical capital of the poor, both to
improve social conditions and allow beneficiaries to make better use of economic opportunities, coupled with social
safety nets to protect from economic shocks and natural disasters. It emphasizes decentralized approaches, shifting
expenditure and implementation responsibilities from the Federal Government to the States, municipalities and local
communities where possible and appropriate. Finally, the CAS recommends better integration of policies and
programs intended to support poverty reduction.
In line with these CAS goals, the proposed project directly promotes sustainable poverty reduction in rural Bahia, the
largest of the Northeast states. By providing basic community infrastructure, services and support for productive rural
investments, the project will generate new employment opportunities and improve the incomes and social welfare of
poor rural families. It will also reduce vulnerability to shocks, particularly in the form of droughts which are endemic
in the rural Northeast. Through careful targeting and disbursement of funds directly to community associations using
proven community-based decision making and implementation arrangements, the project will build social capital at
the local level in the poorest areas of the state, improve cost-effectiveness and enhance sustainability of assets over
which communities feel a strong sense of ownership and commitment. Finally, by developing representative project
Municipal Councils and forging links between these entities and other partners (Federal programs, state and local
governments, civil society, financing institutions and the private sector), the project should help to leverage resources
for local development and improve the consistency and overall impact of rural poverty reduction efforts in Bahia.
2. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
Rural poverty and inequality:   Brazil is characterized by extreme levels of income disparity, with poverty rates
much higher than in other countries with a similar level of per-capita GNP. The Northeast region, including nine states
and part of a tenth, accounts for only 20% of Brazil's land area and about 30% of its 165.9 million population, but is
home to about 22.0 million or 60% of the country's poor and around 11.5 million or 70% of its rural poor. Annual
per capita incomes in the Northeast (R$2,123) are about 42% of the national average (R$4,945); rural incomes of
potential project beneficiaries are only 10% of this average. Approximately 70% of rural household income in the
Northeast is derived from farming and agricultural wage labor.
The State of Bahia, in particular, has the highest absolute number of households living in poverty in the Northeast.
Given its large population size, Bahia's overall poverty rate of 39.1%, jumping to 47.1% in rural Bahia, represents



Page 4
more than 5 million persons, breaking down to roughly 2.8 million in rural areas, and 2.2 million in urban areas.
Nearly three-fourths of rural Bahia households lack piped water supply, 56% are without sanitation services, and
slightly more than one-half of rural households remain without electricity, compared, respectively, with 17%, 9% and
3% for urban Bahia, and 7%, 3% and 0.90/o for urban Brazil as a whole.
The Bank has invested in a variety of studies and analytical work in recent years, to identify the dimensions,
characteristics and causes of rural poverty in Brazil, and to develop strategic options for policy and programmatic
action. Most notable have been: (a) Brazil Poverty Assessment (Report No. 14323, 1995); (b) State Economic
Memoranda (similar to CEMs, SEMs have been completed or are in progress for Ceara, Pernambuco, Bahia and other
Northeast states); (c) Rural Poverty Reduction in Brazil: Towards an Integrated Strategy (Report No. 21790, 2001);
and (d) various surveys, evaluations and impact assessments of the R-NRDP and RPAP projects.
In general terms, rural poverty in the Northeast is fostered by a relatively weak natural resource base, vulnerability to
frequent droughts, low labor productivity, high levels of illiteracy and poor quality and coverage of education,
relatively large family size, poor access to basic infrastructure and services, skewed land distribution, and poorly
functioning rural financial markets. The data also reveal considerable heterogeneity in natural resource endowments,
economic activity and welfare indicators across the region. This suggests the importance of a multi-pronged set of exit
strategies to meet the specific needs of diverse groups, including:
(a)    intensification of the economically viable small-farm sector (raising labor productivity and incomes by
improving the supply of public goods, technology transfer, rural land and financial market reform, and
building of social capital);
(b)    revitalizing commercial agriculture to absorb wage labor and foster growth of downstream processing
activity;
(c)    stimulating growth of the rural non-farm sector, especially processing and services (improvements in
education, roads, electricity and communications to lower transaction costs and improve functioning of
markets);
(d)    accepting a certain level of migration as inevitable and rational (especially among the young, for whom
investment in education is essential ); and
(e)    provision of adequate safety nets for those rural poor who will not benefit from intensification of small-
holder farming, expansion of commercial agriculture and non-farm activities, or migration (typically the rural
elderly and smallholders in areas vulnerable to drought and other natural resource problems).
The proposed RPRP project in Bahia (and the earlier R-NRDP and RPAP projects) constitutes a critical instrument
for the State to pursue several of these strategies; it is particularly relevant for (a), but can also contribute to (b), (c)
and (e). The Federal Government has recently launched the Projeto Alvorada 2000-2002 as the framework for its
poverty reduction efforts in those municipalities nationwide with the lowest HDI (Human Development Index) levels.
Implementation is to be decentralized, stressing community self help and local empowerment. Governmnent views the
Bank-supported RPAP and new round of RPRP projects in Bahia and other states as having piloted important delivery
mechanisms which it would like to see scaled up and generalized, and considers the projects integral components of
its Alvorada strategy. Other Bank-supported efforts are also relevant; for Bahia, these include the Bahia Basic
Education Project, Bahia Municipal Infrastructure Development and Management, Northeast Irrigation 1, Bahia Water
Resource Management, National Agricultural Research, and Land-based Poverty Alleviation projects.
Decentralization:  Since the Brazilian Federal Constitution of 1988, the trend has been towards increasing
decentralization of fiscal resources, public investment, priority-setting and program implementation, from the Federal
Government to the state, municipal and local levels.  The proposed project supports this trend by concentrating
coordination responsibility at the state government level, and strengthening local capacity to participate effectively in
priority setting, decision-making over resource allocations and program/project implementation and maintenance.
The volume of resources currently available in Brazil for rural poverty reduction is considerable, and yet the neediest
communities are often unaware that they exist or how to access them, and many investments do not respond well to
the priorities of intended beneficiaries and/or are not delivered in as cost-effective a manner as possible. By
expanding and strengthening the Municipal Councils, and forging links between them and other potential partners
(Federal programs, state and local governments, civil society, financial institutions and the private sector), the project
should help to leverage resources and improve the consistency and overall impact of public resources directed towards
rural poverty reduction in Bahia.

3. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
Sector issues: The major sector issues addressed by this project are rural poverty and decentralization By improving
access of poor farm communities in Bahia to basic economic and social infrastructure, and productive opportunities,
the project will raise incomes and well-being. The use of participatory processes that have been proven to increase the
voice of rural communities in priority-setting and decision-making over resource allocation will also help to build
social capital, strengthen local governance, and improve the effectiveness and sustainability of development
investments.
The project will build on the success of community-driven development (CDD) mechanisms that were piloted, tested
and expanded under the R-NRDP and RPAP. The cumulative impact of these earlier projects attests to the robustness
of this strategy: (a) at a total cost of about US$900 million, some 50,000 infrastructure, productive and social
investments have reached about 7.5 million poor people with at least one subproject, in over 30,000 separate
communities in the rural Northeast; (b) program investments have generated incremental annual income and savings
of over US$200 million; (c) sustainability of investments is high, with about 90% of a sample of over 8,000
subprojects funded in 1995 and 1997-8 still fully operational; (d) cost efficiency has also been high, with recorded
cost savings of 40-50% over similar publicly provided infrastructure and services; (e) of the almost 1,000 Municipal
Councils formed to date, some 30% have progressed beyond simple subproject decision-making to engage in
municipal planning and allocation of non-project resources, and about 25% of community associations have also used
their social capital and assets acquired under the projects to access non-project financing. Although intangible and
difficult to quantify, there is an observed, marked difference in self-respect and confidence in many participating
communities.
Strategic choices: The main strategic choices made in project design include the following:
* Stimulating improvements in both social welfare and local economic activity. A key constraint to rural
development in Bahia has been the lack of opportunity to intensify smallholder agriculture, and stimulate growth
of commercial agriculture, downstream processing and other non-farm activities. This project will diversify
income and employment opportunities in a range of farm and non-farm endeavors through support for productive
activities, technical assistance and investment in both social and economic infrastructure/services, identified by
communities as being most relevant for their well-being.
• Community-based approach: The community-based approach, when compared to similar investments executed by
traditional public sector entities, has proven to be cost-effective, more responsive to local priorities and to offer
better prospects for sustainability (Annex 2).
* Integration of programs and policies at the local level. Adopting a decentralized approach that focuses decision-
making at the local level has helped to overcome the complexity problems of earlier failed attempts at integrated
rural development. A growing number of Municipal Councils are proactively seeking funding and participating in
decision-making over non-project sources of finance. Under the new project, Councils will be further encouraged
through training and technical assistance to expand their input into broader local planning, with a view to
achieving better integration of policies and programs and improving the impact of public resources available for
poverty reduction.
*  Targeting of resources. One of the most important benefits of the project will come from community experience
gained through managing an investment subproject and participating in decision-making in a Municipal Council.
For that reason, a minimum level of funding has been allocated to each poor rural municipality in the State, with
higher levels targeted to the poorest areas with the greatest needs (lowest level of Human Development Index).
* Rigorous monitoring and evaluation. The predecessor R-NRDP and RPAP projects made substantial provision for
piloting, testing, and M&E, and this was extremely helpful for continuous refinement of processes. Under the new
project, an enhanced MIS and an evaluation framework will be implemented to measure impact through
independently executed, repeater surveys of beneficiaries and control group panels, with a view to maximizing
poverty alleviation impact.
* Graduation of communities - exit strategy. Most of the investments requested by communities in the past (around
77%/o) comprised infrastructure subprojects. However, since the rural poor are generally off the radar screen of any
formal credit institution in the rural Northeast, particularly as individuals, project matching grants for productive
investments and technical assistance can be catalytic by encouraging the formation of groups, providing some



Page 6
experience in the management of financial assets and income-earning activities, and thus making them more
attractive to financial institutions. Therefore, communities that presently lack access to formal credit can qualify
for one grant-based productive subproject (defined as those generating product sold in the market), after which
they will be graduated from such support, (under the R-NRDP and RPAP there were no limits, although as a
practical matter the MCs have tended to limit communities to an average two subprojects of any kind, in order to
ration scarce resources). At the same time, a major effort will be made to link communities graduating from
productive projects, to possible sources of formal credit. In particular, the Bank of the Northeast (BN) has
increasingly been seeking organized communities to which it can provide group credit. BN and the RPAPs have
already partnered in some places, albeit in an ad hoc manner - but there is now enough positive experience that
the state of Bahia and BN are interested in taking the cooperation to another level. Therefore, agreements have
been reached on information sharing and coordination, which will be detailed in the project Operational Manual:
(a) BN will have access to relevant information from the project MIS about group credit candidates, which it will
pass on to its units in charge of credit lines and government programs in which it participates; (b) BN's local
development agents will be invited to attend Municipal Council meetings; and (c) BN will provide Bahia with
feedback on project-graduated groups to which it has extended credit, for use in project monitoring and evaluation.
BN has also undertaken to expand its testing of the Bank-financed CrediAmigo micro-credit program into rural
areas.
* With regard to community infrastructure and social subprojects, graduation considerations are different. Most of
these subprojects are in the realm of core public services (water, sanitation, electrification, social investments), and
the definition of the minimum acceptable level of such services necessarily varies over time. Grant-based support
is provided because of the poverty targeting under the project. The R-NRDPs and RPAPs demonstrated that the
CDD approach to rural infrastructure and service delivery targeted to the poorest can work, in a cost effective
manner and on a large scale, while also having important impacts in terms of social capital formation and
improved local governance. Under the proposed project in Bahia (both the initial and second phases), the state
intends to expand the geographic coverage of the CDD approach, and to encourage project Municipal Councils to
proactively seek new sources of funding, and to engage in priority-setting and decision-making over a much wider
range of activities, with a view to improving the effectiveness of local governments and the integration and overall
impact of public resources directed towards rural poverty reduction.
- Information Technology. The new program will expand ongoing, successful piloting of the use of information
technology to increase transparency by making available, in real time, information about the program itself, as
well as using the internet to connect communities directly to markets, both in Brazil and internationally.
C: Project Description Summary
1. Project components (see Annex 3 for a detailed description and Annex 4 for a detailed cost breakdown):
The total project cost is US$75 million, of which the Bank will finance US$54.35 million. Component A
(Community Subprojects) provides matching grants to rural community associations to finance approximately
3,500 infrastructure, productive and social subprojects (up to US$50,000 each) identified by these groups as priority
investments that will improve community well-being. After approval of subprojects by the State Technical Unit or
project Municipal Councils, project funds are disbursed directly to the community associations, which manage
subproject implementation, operation and maintenance (Annex 3). This component includes three subprograms -
PAC, FUMAC and FUMAC-P.
*  State Community Schemes (PAC).  Under the PAC subprogram, rural communities submit their investment
proposals directly to the State Technical Unit (STU), which screens and approves them and releases funds to the
beneficiary associations. Whereas this was the predominant arrangement under the earlier R-NRDP projects, it
has receded in importance as decentralization from the State to local levels has progressed. At the start of the
RPAP projects, it was expected that about one-third of community proposals would be processed under the PAC,
but the actual share decreased steadily during implementation, in favor of the other two modalities described
below.  Under the proposed new RPRP project for Bahia, the PAC will be retained as an option to which
communities may occasionally resort in cases where Municipal Councils are not functioning properly, but it is
expected to account for no more than 10% of all subprojects (up to US$6.7 million of total community subproject
costs).



Page 7
Municipal Community Schemes (FUMAC). Under this subprogram, decision-making on investment proposals is
delegated by the State to project Municipal Councils, composed of community members and representatives of
civil society and municipal authorities. At least 80 percent of Council voting members are potential project
beneficiaries. The Municipal Councils discuss, seek to build consensus on priorities and approve community
proposals, in the context of an indicative annual budget amount determined by the state. After the Councils'
recommendations are reviewed by the STU for consistency with guidelines in the project Operational Manual,
funds are disbursed directly to the community associations. This became the dominant subprogram under the
RPAP and will remain so under the RPRP, accounting for about 60% (US$40.6 million) of total community
subproject costs.
* Pilot Municipal Community Funds (FUMAC-P). The FUMAC-P is a more decentralized variant of FUMAC and
was piloted under the RPAP with higb-performing Municipal Councils. The STU establishes an annual budget
envelope, according to a distribution formula based on clear and measurable criteria (rural population, poverty
levels and previous year's performance). Based on this budget, Municipal Councils submit an Annual Operating
Plan (Plano Operativo Anual) for STU review. Upon approval, funds are transferred to the Council, which is
then responsible for managing their distribution to community associations and assisting them with
implementation of subprojects. Although FUMAC-P was initially expected to account for only about 12% of
community investments under the RPAP, it quickly grew in popularity and more Municipal Councils proved
capable of taking it on than originally anticipated. It is expected that under the new RPRP project, 30% of total
component costs (US$20.2 million) would be used under the FUMAC-P subprogram.
Component B (Institutional development) will finance technical assistance and training to increase capacity of
implementing entities including MCs, community associations and the STU. It also includes funds for technical
assistance to support Bahia in addressing state modernization and reform issues relevant to poverty reduction,
following on a similar successful activity under the RPAP, as an integral part of the broader state-level policy dialogue
between the Bank and the state. This component will also support the expansion of ongoing, successful piloting of
information technology to increase transparency and to connect communities and MCs to markets. Component C
(Project administration) will finance incremental costs (excluding salaries) of project administration and
coordination including supervision, monitoring and impact evaluation. The State Government of Bahia will provide
counterpart funding of US$13.95 million (18.6%), community associations will provide US$6.7 million (9%), in cash
or in kind, and the Bank loan will finance the remaining 72.5% of costs.

2. Key policy and institutional reforms supported by the project:
The project supports a CDD approach to rural poverty reduction, and fosters decentralization through the promotion of
strong local participation in decision-making and resource allocation. As discussed in section B.2, the existing policy
and institutional framework in Brazil is quite supportive of these objectives and is not expected to inhibit project
viability. Rather, the need at this stage is to scale up implementation on the ground of successful approaches tested
under the R-NRDP and RPAP projects, both expanding geographic coverage and extending the reach and potential
impact of Municipal Councils on rural poverty reduction.

3. Benefits and target population:
Benefits:
* Some 250,000 rural famnilies in Bahia (or about 1.1 million people benefiting from at least one subproject) will
realize improvements in their quality of life and/or incomes, through provision of better access to water,
electricity, and other basic economic and social infrastructure and services, and support for productive activities.
Specific impacts may include enhanced productivity, increased family income, job creation, income
diversification, improved social indicators and reduced vulnerability to drought.
. Women will benefit especially from water supply, electricity and social investments, which amongst other
impacts, improve family health, generate time savings and allows them to participate in productive activities.
Support for productive subprojects also enables rural women to seek paying jobs and contribute to increased
family cash incomes.
* Social capital will be created and governance improved at the rural community and municipality levels.
* The volume of non-project finance available for rural poverty reduction, and its effectiveness, should increase as
Municipal Councils become more proactive in seeking funding for local development needs and extend their
involvement in priority-setting and decision-making over resource allocation of other Federal, state and local
programs.
Target population:
e The proposed project is targeted to the poorest communities in rural Bahia. The effectiveness of poverty targeting
mechanisms under the RPAP to date is demonstrated by a series of independent physical performance and impact
evaluation studies, and a recent rural poverty report for Brazil (April 2001) which show remarkably similar results.
About 84% of the program's targeted rural poor reside in remote, low density areas with little or no permanent
structures or infrastructure, and deriving their main income from farming and agricultural labor. A significant,
additional cohort lives in rural areas directly adjacent to the urban periphery of municipal centers, where
headcount poverty measures are lowest. The Bahia project area includes 407 municipalities - i.e. all municipalities
except for 10 located in metropolitan Salvador. The poorest 170 municipalities, i.e., with the lowest relative HDI
ranking (Annex 3), will be allocated the sum of R$59.5 million (averaging R$350,000 per municipality). For the
remaining 237 municipalities, the sum of R$59.25 million will be allocated (averaging R$250,000 per
municipality).
* It is estimated that a total beneficiary population of 250,000 families (25% of Bahia's rural population) will be
reached with at least one subproject. They are primarily small-holders, tenants, sharecroppers, and landless
laborers, who will identify, prepare, implement and maintain some 3,500 community infrastructure and productive
investments financed under the project. They will also build social capital, gain the experience to pursue other
sources of financing and pursue self-help solutions to local problems, and will participate increasingly in decision-
making over a broader range of local development programs.
4. Institutional and implementation arrangements:
Implementation period: Four years
Executing Entities:
Community Associations (CAs) are groups of rural citizens with a common interest who organize into legally-
constituted civil associations. They identify, prepare, implement, supervise, operate and maintain their subprojects,
assisted both by technical specialists whom they contract directly and by technical assistance and training made
available by Municipal Councils and the State Technical Unit. Once subprojects are approved for financing, CAs can
access a share of the costs for design and implementation assistance.
Municipal Councils (MCs) include representatives of beneficiaries and civil society (80% of the membership), as
well as local government (20% of membership). The key organization for targeting of benefits and allocating project
resources, MCs also provide a critical link to local government and have the potential to engage in other non-project
activities. The MCs play a fundamental role in mobilizing communities and promoting their participation in local



Page 9
decision making. They receive, prioritize and approve subproject proposals from the CAs during regularly scheduled
and widely publicized meetings that the public is encouraged to attend, and then submit investment plans to the State
Technical Unit.
The State Technical Unit The State Company for Regional Action (CAR), the State Technical Unit (STU) for the
earlier RPAP, will continue to serve that function under the new RPRP project. The STU will maintain responsibility
for overall project coordination, but with increased delegation of duties to its regional offices. It will also increasingly
delegate supervision of community associations and subprojects to the MCs and concentrate instead on oversight of
the MCs themselves, as well as general project coordination and promotion. The latter duties include continuous
execution of information campaigns, project reporting, impact evaluation, MIS updating, and design and provision of
tailored training modules for MCs and CAs on key project issues.
Subproject Cycle:
* Community Associations determine their local investment priorities and prepare subproject proposals for
investment financing;
• Subproject proposals from community associations are submitted to respective project Municipal Councils where
proposals are prioritized and approved, based on indicative resource envelopes (FUMAC) or actual budget
allocations (FUMAC-P). This step does not occur for PAC, where community associations submit subproject
proposals directly to the STU for review.
* The STU technically evaluates approved subprojects and confirms compliance with subproject guidelines before
releasing funds.
* Subproject agreements (c6nvenios) are signed between the STU and Community Associations (in the case of PAC
and FUMAC), or between the STU and Municipal Councils (in the case of FUMAC-P). These agreements spell
out the terms and conditions for the funding, execution, ownership, operation and maintenance of the approved
subprojects.
• Resources for subproject implementation are then transferred directly from the project to the association's
(PAC/FUMAC) or council's (FUMAC-P) bank account, respectively;
• Community Associations are responsible for contracting goods, works and technical assistance for subproject
execution. Community Associations also bear responsibility for operation and maintenance of all investments,
and may request technical assistance to develop operation and maintenance programs and techniques.
Project Oversight: The Bahia Secretariat of Planning, Science and Technology (SEPLANTEC) is responsible for
project oversight. SEPLANTEC delegates day-to-day project execution to the state Company for Regional Action
(CAR).
Project Coordination: The State Company for Regional Action (CAR) performs the STU function, supported by its
16 regional offices. It coordinates overall project activities, with the following specific duties: (a) review community
subproject proposals for compliance with project guidelines and eligibility criteria in the project Operational Manual;
(b) assess the degree of community participation in identifying, preparing and executing subprojects and quality of
technical assistance; (c) supervise the MCs to ensure they are adequately managing quality of subproject
implementation and providing sufficient training support to communities; (d) implement introductory training and
technical assistance programs for all MCs and CAs with approved subprojects (including training on subproject
implementation, contracting, O&M and financial management); (e) monitor and apply performance incentives to
reward efficiency, transparency and inclusiveness of community associations and municipal councils, and also to
penalize poor performance/misappropriation (e.g. legal action for fund misallocation); (f) monitor performance
through the Management Information System  (MIS) and  periodically report progress; (g) prepare annual
implementation and physical performance reviews; and (h) submit project POAs to the Bank for approval. For the
most common types of subprojects, standardized designs and cost indicators would be made available by the STU to
ensure reasonable quality and costing for subproject implementation. Departures from these standard designs would
have to be fully justified in the subproject proposal, as would proposed investments which fall outside the range of
standardized costs. Finally, the STU will conduct statewide information campaigns to continuously disseminate
information about the project and its guidelines to all potential beneficiary communities, thereby increasing



Page 10
awareness, transparency and participation in the program. The preparation of an action plan for the statewide
information campaign, satisfactory to the Bank would be a condition of loan effectiveness.
Project operational procedures: The project would be implemented according to detailed procedures defined in its
Operational Manual. This Manual is based on that used in the preceding RPAP, but has been revised and updated to
reflect lessons learned during implementation. A user-friendly synthesis of this document will be made available to
Municipal councils and community associations. The adoption by the State of this Operational Manual, in a form
satisfactory to the Bank would be a condition of loan effectiveness.
Monitoring and evaluation arrangements: Analysis of implementation will depend on a database of subproject
information from the project Management Information System (MIS) operated and maintained by the STU. The MIS
used under RPAP will continue to be improved under the new project. The database is currently organized in three
general levels: (a) a subproject information module, which contains pertinent physical and financial information for
each subproject; (b) a financial management module, from which Statements of Expenditure (SOEs) are generated;
and (c) a project management module, from which all project reports are generated. Under the new project, these
three modules will be integrated to allow improved monitoring of the entire subproject cycle. The database will also
be expanded to include community profiles, which will also be used to evaluate project impact. The MIS will also
monitor the increase in share of the rural poor population that is covered with basic services (e.g., water, electricity,
road access, social services), and the share of the rural poor that have received grant financing for productive
subprojects and subsequently graduated to commercial credit. Finally, the MIS will be migrated on-line to allow real
time data entry and monitoring directly from the field and regional offices. The STU will continue to be responsible
for maintaining and regularly updating the MIS, including key Project information (as agreed with the Bank).
Through periodic processing of the database information, combined with field visits and inputs from project
supervision reports, project contracted studies and audits, the STU would monitor project characteristics and trends,
identify implementation problems and accomplishments and undertake or promote appropriate actions to improve
project implementation. The Bank's Recife Office would also monitor project performance indicators through the
online MIS, and with inputs from the State, review monthly disbursement summaries and supervise subproject
implementation progress on a sample basis in the field. The establishment and operation of a revised MIS, acceptable
to the Bank would be a condition of loan effectiveness.
Finally, the project would implement evaluation studies to assess the impact of the subproject and provide feedback to
improve project operations. These studies would include: (i) annual physical performance reviews to assess the
quality and sustainability of common types of financed subprojects, including reviews of community-based
procurement; (ii) an evaluation/implementation review, carried out at mid-term, to include beneficiary consultations to
evaluate project performance and impact as perceived by its beneficiaries; and (iii) a rigorous and comprehensive
impact evaluation. The impact evaluation will use repeated surveys of project beneficiaries, non-beneficiary
households, and beneficiaries of similar projects with centralized delivery mechanisms to assess (a) poverty targeting
of beneficiaries relative to the income distribution of the population at large; (b) household welfare; (c) social capital
formation at the community level; (d) improved governance at the municipal level; (e) cost-effectiveness of
infrastructure investments compared with traditional delivery mechanisms, and (f) cost-benefit of productive
investments. In addition, community leaders and municipal leaders will be surveyed for the analysis of social capital
and governance impacts. Presentation of Terms of Reference for the project baseline study and for the overall
evaluation framework, both acceptable to the Bank would be a condition of loan effectiveness. The first baseline field
survey will be conducted within six months of project effectiveness. A resurvey, to be contracted at the same time as
the baseline study will be conducted two years later, followed by further resurveys after four and six years, depending
on interim results.
Accounting, financial reporting and auditing arrangements: The financial management systems of CAR were
reviewed by a Bank Financial Management Specialist during project preparation for compliance with OP/BP 10.02
and the Loan Administration Change Initiative (LACI) Implementation Handbook. Based on this review, the project
was certified as a "A", indicating that the project satisfies the Bank's financial management requirements, however
minor adjustments in the format of the existing financial management reports should be made. CAR currently uses a
system entitled "Sistema de Acompanhamento de Convenios (SAC)" to monitor transfer of funds to communities and
ensure compliance with agreed convenios. Under the new project, CAR will implement an action plan within the first
six months of project implementation (agreed with the Bank, and attached in the financial management assessment
report) to amend the existing format of financial reports to allow PMR reporting, and adjust project accounting and



Page 1 1
reporting procedures to comply with Bank requirements, building on the SAC system. The annual financial audit will
also include a separate opinion on the eligibility of expenditures disbursed on the basis of SOEs. According to
arrangements for Bank-financed projects in Brazil, the annual financial audit of the project accounts for the period
January I to December 31 of the year will be carried out by an Independent Auditor, which is acceptable to the Bank.
The audit report will be submitted to the Bank no later than June 30 in the year following the year for which the
project accounts are audited. The Auditor's TOR will include the issuance of a management letter on internal controls
six months after effectiveness.
D: Project Rationale
1.  Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection
a. Reversion to more traditional, centralized approach to implementation using line agencies. Experience with
integrated rural development projects in Northeast Brazil during the 1970s and 1980s conclusively demonstrated
that more centralized approaches to planning and implementation of infrastructure and service delivery through
public institutions are not effective in dispersed rural areas (high overhead costs, coordination difficulties,
subprojects that did not accurately respond to community needs, poor sustainability of investments). Instead, the
proposed project builds on a successful CDD model, broadly recognized for its effectiveness in delivering rural
infrastructure and services (cost savings of 30-50% vis-a-vis comparable works executed by public agencies), its
transparency in resource allocation and strong performance in building social capital of rural communities.
b. Channeling resources directly to municipal governments.   Decentralization of finance and program
responsibilities to municipal governments, without also building capacity at the community level to interact
effectively with these governments, carries the risk of merely repeating difficulties associated with centralized
decision-making (albeit at a lower level). The project Municipal Councils are making a major contribution to
improving transparency and participation in local development planning. The proposed project will consolidate
the Municipal Council experience, expanding both their geographic coverage and involvement in decision-
making over a broader range of poverty reduction programs, thereby helping indirectly to improve the quality and
effectiveness of local government.
c. Elimination of the PAC sub-component. Given the encouraging results of the FUMAC and FUMAC-P sub-
components under the R-NRDP and RPAP, consideration was given to eliminating the PAC option entirely from
the proposed project. However, Municipal Councils are not yet functioning in all areas, and there are occasional
performance problems. In the interests of retaining some arrangement to serve rural communities caught in such
a situation, it was decided to retain the PAC under the RPRP projects, but to limit its use to no more than 10% of
total subproject costs.
d. Onlending to the states through a program loan to the Federal Government. Since initial and follow-up RPRP
projects are likely throughout the Northeast region, as well as in some states with a high incidence of rural
poverty elsewhere in Brazil (Section A. I ),consideration was given to the alternative of a single large Bank loan
to the Federal government, to be on-lent to the states.  However, the very positive benefits in terms of
demonstrated commitment and ownership when the states perceive that they are in the project driver's seat
(reflected, inter alia, in generally timely and adequate counterpart funding and maintenance of strong technical
teams at the STU level) - compared with the less than satisfactory performance under earlier, more centralized
rural development programs - were judged to outweigh any apparent savings in the time and costs of processing
individual state loans. Indeed, implementation delays that could result from more complex arrangements to
transfer funds from Federal to state level might offset such savings and would certainly undermine the credibility
of the project on the ground (where communities now rely on timely decision-making and resource transfer).

3. Lessons learned and reflected in the proposed project design:
Decentralization of fiscal and investment decision-making and implementation from federal to state and local
governments, to community organizations, ensures efficient program administration and superior outcomes.
Experience shows that decentralized community-driven approaches reduce bureaucracy, eliminate administrative
bottlenecks and reinforce accountability for project performance by placing decision-makers near beneficiaries.
Under the new project the existing, decentralized institutional structure will be further devolved, with increased
delegation of duties to Municipal Councils and greater utilization of STU regional offices to promote more responsive
and local level monitoring, data collection, coordination, and supervision.
Participation by beneficiaries in the selection, financing, execution, and O&M of subprojects has ensured that
investments meet genuine community needs, led to cost savings, and has increased community 'ownership' leading to
improved sustainability of investments. This methodology will be continued under the new project.
Poverty targeting mechanisms that are simple, verifiable and based on objective criteria, can foster transparency,
minimize political interference in project resource allocation and ensure that project resources reach the poorest areas.
Poverty targeting mechanisms under the RPAP to date have been notably effective in reaching the poorest rural
populations in the Northeast. About 84% of the program's beneficiary population are small farmers and rural laborers
living in remote, low density areas with acute deficiencies in access to basic infrastructure and services. A significant
additional population resides in rural areas directly adjacent to the urban periphery of municipal centers, where
headcount poverty measures are lowest. Experience with project Municipal Councils demonstrates that communities
themselves are the best-positioned and informed to target effectively. Under the new project, broad targeting will be
undertaken (i) at the municipal level, with indicative budgets assigned to each Municipal Council, differentiated
according to poverty indices; and (ii) at the community- level, by the Municipal Councils. Communities which
improve their relative socioeconomic conditions significantly through project investments would be encouraged to
seek non-project financing to meet development needs. In field observations of RPAP, Municipal Councils were
found to already be following this practice, either (i) reducing priority ranking and/or (ii) excluding requests from
those communities that had already received several subprojects.
Supervision has been found to be an indispensable determinant of success and sustainability. It needs to be reinforced
at all levels and involve local entities closest to the communities, particularly Municipal Councils and NGOs. Under
the new project supervision responsibilities will be increasingly devolved to MCs, who will be-supported with training
and technical assistance. Measures will also be taken to modernize all Councils, gradually providing computers and
information technology to all of them.



Page 13
A user-friendly monitoring and evaluation system facilitates the subproject evaluation process, provides feedback and
necessary information to improve targeting and efficiency, and is an essential management and planning tool. Under
the new project important revisions will be undertaken to strengthen the MIS (Section C.4 under "Monitoring and
Evaluation Arrangements') to improve real time monitoring of the entire project cycle. A more comprehensive
impact evaluation component will also be introduced to measure income, welfare and social capital gains.
Dissemination of "best practices ", such as experiences with NGOs in Rio Grande do Norte, EMATERCE in Ceara,
FUMAC Councils in Bahia and Sergipe, and FUMAC-P in Pernambuco can hasten learning and reward innovation.
Under the new project, exchanges between states, municipalities and communities will be expanded further using
more frequent training seminars, and workshops.
Standardization of subproject documents, technical designs and unit costs simplifies the subproject preparation and
evaluation process, improves the quality of subprojects, facilitates the procurement of goods and works, prevents
over-design and enables participation by poorer communities. The existing database of standard designs and
documentation have been reviewed, technically updated where necessary, and further expanded for the new project.
Environmental protection criteria: Experience demonstrates, that because of their small scale, most subprojects do
not have a significant effect on the environment. Nevertheless, the detailed environmental checklist developed under
RPAP will be maintained and has been updated for the proposed project. Where environmental issues are a concern,
standard subproject designs have been developed and will continue to be used by communities and MCs during
subproject implementation. Further, an environmental specialist will be maintained at the STU to provide additional
technical assistance on environmental matters as well as provide training to increase environmental awareness of MCs
and community groups.
Technical assistance enhances the ability of community associations and MCs to identify, prepare and implement
subprojects, thereby augmenting their capacity to compete for investment funds. Technical assistance needs to be
targeted to weaker municipalities to improve their planning, management and financial capacity to participate in the
project. Locating and/or developing sources of technical assistance in rural areas requires significant attention and
needs to be monitored at the local level. Under the new project increased attention will be placed on training at the
community level - funds will be made available for the appointment of 'technical advisors' to be recruited by each
municipal council. These advisors will be responsible for managing and coordinating local technical and training
needs. Increasing efforts will also be placed on more meaningful involvement of civil society (e.g. NGOs and other
civil and church groups) - particularly with respect to increasing the flow of information, mobilizing the poorest
groups and supporting training activities at the community level.
A system of checks and balances, clearly-defined and well-disseminated, is essential to ensure proper use of funds
and sound targeting of resources. Rules and procedures for such a system, including guidelines for performance
incentives and penalties, have been reviewed and updated and are detailed in the Project Operational Manual.
Performance incentives will include promoting better-performing FUMAC Councils to FUMAC-P; increasing
Councils' indicative budget envelope; increasing the number of investments or investment volume permitted to a
community association; or incentives for environmental or technologically innovative investments. Penalties would
attach to cases of mis-management and diversion of funds and include removal from eligibility to participate, reduced
availability of funds, demotion from FUMAC-P to FUMAC, and/or judicial penalties where appropriate. In addition
to penalties, Municipal Councils include participation of local NGOs (i.e., Rural Workers' Union, the Church),
representatives of public ministries and municipal officials, and Council meetings are publicly announced and open to
broad participation. Finally, the project is installing computers in the Councils, whose role, among others, will be to
publicize Council decisions on their own and the Technical Unit's webpage. All of the above are designed to boost
and institutionalize transparency.
Minimize use of the PAC approach, particularly since the FUMAC and FUMAC-P sub-components have clear
advantages with respect to targeting, sustainability and social capital formation in poor rural communities. Under the
new project, PAC expenditure will not exceed 10% of total community subproject investments.
Productive subprojects should be subjected to rigorous selection, preparation, technical assistance and supervision
criteria. Under the new project, a 'one-shot' matching grant will be provided to eligible productive investments that
(i) provide services for a large number of community members; (ii) whose collective use is regulated by strict



Page 14
operational guidelines (regulamento de uso); and (iii) for which operation and maintenance is assured by charging
adequate user fees to both association members and non-members. Revised procedures for productive subprojects are
outlined in the new Project Operational Manual, as are arrangements to facilitate access to formal credit by graduating
communities (Annex 3).
Broaden role of municipal councils in local planning, by promoting greater integration between local govermnents
and project municipal councils, and providing information to councils on other programs and alternative sources of
grant and credit financing. Field observations indicate that over 30% of project Municipal Councils already
participate in some prioritization of other (non-project) resources. If carefully nurtured, not only with the right mix of
technical assistance, information and funding support, but also by insisting that clear and transparent rules continue to
apply to the functioning of the Councils, this democratic forum may well become one of the most valuable and
durable institutions for rural development in the Northeast.
4. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership:
For the State Government of Bahia, the community-based approach to the provision of basic, social and productive
infrastructure has proven to be a cost-effective and timely means of improving the conditions of the rural poor. The
proposed project and its predecessors were designed in close consultation with the State Secretariat for Planning,
Science and Technology, which has actively promoted them domestically and abroad. The new operation was
submitted to the Federal Government (COFIEX) in May 2000 and approved rapidly, and the Federal Government has
endorsed it (and the RPRP projects planned for other states) as an integral part of its new Projeto Alvorada framework
for poverty reduction. The proposed project implementation unit (CAR) has a long and substantial track record of
implementing decentralized community-based rural development projects. Its good performance in the management
and implementation of the earlier R-NRDP and RPAP, and the State's consistent record of timely counterpart funding,
are evidence of strong commitment to rural poverty reduction, which bodes well for the new project.
5. Value added of Bank support in this project:
As the principal international partner engaged in a sustained, long-term partnership with the Brazilian Government to
address rural poverty issues in the Northeast, the Bank is particularly well-placed to support expansion of community-
based rural development efforts in the region. The Bank contributes its experience under the successful R-NRDP and
RPAP projects in Bahia and other Northeast states - which have served as a template in the design of the new
operation. Bank participation will ensure that international experience with past and ongoing community-driven
programs is incorporated into project design and that sound international quality standards of monitoring, evaluation
and impact assessment are applied. An especially important feature of Bank value-added under the RPRP projects in
Bahia and other states will be its ability to facilitate closer local integration of a wide spectrum of programs aimed at
rural poverty reduction. The Bank is well-positioned to help forge these links, not only because of its direct role in
financing the RPRP and developing the Municipal Council mechanism, but also because of its involvement in other
important sectoral programs relevant to rural poverty reduction (irrigation, agricultural research, land reform,
education, municipal development) and the many opportunities for policy dialogue and consensus building in the
context of its fairly active program of collaborative research and analytical work on poverty and rural development
issues in Brazil.
As the program has evolved and as processes have become increasingly refined, the Bank's role has also progressed.
Under the RPAPs, the Bank assumed the critical role of catalyst, serving as an independent monitor and evaluator of
program performance, helping to ensure that processes were complied with, that undue interference was minimized,
and that lessons learnt during implementation were captured and applied. Under the new program, where processes
have already been well-developed, it is envisaged that the role of the Bank will shift once again to focus increasingly
on strengthening the linkages between community organizations, their representative councils and government, other
public programs, financial institutions and markets. By serving as facilitator, the Bank can play a critical role in
formalizing municipal councils as key partners in the local development process, be catalytic in helping to consolidate
the participatory and transparent resource allocation at the local level (including the use of information technologies),
and ensure that these processes continue beyond the life and scope of the project when external support will be
gradually phased out or redirected to other aspects of poverty reduction. Finally, the Bank will undertake, as part of
its strategic updating of all work in Northeast Brazil, a yearly review of how the implementatiofi of the RPRP program
is contributing to integrate broader issues of poverty reduction in the Northeast.

E: Summary Project Analyses (Detailed assessments are in the project file, see Annex 9)
1. Economic (see Annex 5):
Specific investments carried out under the new project will be decided by communities over the life span of the
project. It is thus not possible to know a priori how available resources will be precisely allocated, and therefore a
precise ex ante estimation of their cost-effectiveness, economic rate of return and fiscal impact is not possible.
However, subprojects to be financed under the proposed project would, in general, be similar to those financed under
previous and ongoing community-based rural development projects. Based on the accumulated experience from the
R-NRDP and RPAP, the following aspects of project investments were assessed: (i) cost-effectiveness; (ii) financial
viability of productive subprojects; and (iii) the fiscal impact of the new RPRP.
Cost-effectiveness: Several aspects of project design help to ensure that infrastructure and social subprojects
undertaken represent the least-cost, best alternative. First, the demand-driven nature of each subproject permits scarce
resources to flow where they are most needed. Community participation, under the direction of the project Municipal
Councils, ensures that the chosen subproject is the best alternative for the local community. Second, the use of
standard technical designs (projetos padroes) for the most common types of infrastructure and social subprojects
(including corresponding cost parameters) ensures that community associations employ least-cost models for
subproject implementation and also decrease search and information costs. Third, the delegation of subproject
implementation directly to the community associations has proven to generate cost savings, when compared to
comparable quality works implemented by public sector agencies. The contracting procedures prescribed in the
Project Operational Manual require direct contracting through competitive processes on all subprojects: the
community association solicits three bids for the subproject and chooses the least-cost bid. Based on the analysis of a
random sample of subprojects (including ten categories which collectively represent some 80% of the types of
subprojects being financed), it has been found that, for infrastructure and social subprojects, costs under the RPAP
were 30-50% cheaper than projects of similar quality, implemented by the state.
Internal economic rates of return were also estimated for the most common types of productive subprojects. These
all exceed 30 percent. Both analyses were made assuming constant benefits over a ten-year subproject life cycle. In
addition to these positive impacts, benefits are largely concentrated in the subprojects' beneficiary communities.
2. Financial (see Annex 5):
Benefit-cost ratios are high (greater than 2.0) for all productive subprojects analyzed. Analysis of these subprojects
also suggests that investments are generally financially sustainable. Although beneficiary associations do receive a
one-time matching grant, the investments tend to be sustainable because cost recovery through user fees by the
average beneficiary association is normally adequate to cover both O&M and replacement of original investments
before the end of their useful economic life.
The direct fiscal impact of the new project on the Bahia state budget depends on what the State would have done in
the absence of the project. First, if the State had alternatively provided these basic services through traditional
delivery mechanisms, the fiscal savings are direct and significant. Evaluations indicate that a significant fiscal
contribution will be made by subproject investments through expected cost savings to state and municipal
governments. For example, under the RPAP project, the State is estimated to have saved over R$1 million/year by
eliminating the need for water trucks to supply communities in time of drought. Severe drought magnifies this figure.
Information from the Superintendency for the Development of the Northeast (SUDENE) suggests that between
October 1998 and June 2000, R$4.1 million was spent in Bahia on water trucks alone. Provision of better quality,
more reliable water also has less quantifiable but nonetheless significant impacts on health, reducing public health
costs of Municipal Governments. There are also tangible cost savings associated with the community driven design of
the project. Under RPAP, the costs of investments implemented by communities (either directly or contracted) under
the project was 30-50% less than prices paid by public authorities for works of similar type and quality. Furthermore,
the Project alleviates over time the dependency of municipalities on central and state government transfers by
strengthening the capacity of local governments and communities to take responsibility for local economic and social
development.  Subproject operation and maintenance costs are also typically paid by the beneficiary community,
reducing the fiscal burden on municipalities and states (with a few exceptions, e.g., electricity and some types of
water supply, commonly maintained by state agencies and operated in return for a user fee). Through a variety of
design features (e.g., local prioritization, development of financial plans, and operation and maintenance plans) the



Page 16
economic viability and financial sustainability of subprojects are enhanced. Second, if the State had not undertaken
these investments in basic services without this project, the additional, highly cost-effective spending is very small -
0.4% of total state expenditures for year 2000 -- compared to total/discretionary/social spending, and has no
significant impact on the aggregate fiscal position of the State.
Finally, in terms of revenue generation, direct impacts are likely to be small, but indirect impact could be significant.
Incremental ICMS (sales tax) revenues are insignificant for the state. Much of the incremental production of the
subprojects is either self-consumed, not liable to taxation, and/or circulates in informal markets where tax is rarely
paid. But it can imply a significant increase in ICMS collected within the poor municipalities in which the project
operates (ICMS is collected by the state and all municipalities receive 25% of collections independent of where it is
collected). Experience under RPAP showed that there was a large increase in the purchase and use of domestic
appliances when electricity became available, appreciably increasing the ICMS revenue to municipalities. This
observation is also applicable to purchases of items such as agricultural machinery and irrigation equipment.
3. Technical:
The technical viability of the project has been demonstrated under the successful R-NRDP and RPAP projects. The
new project will adopt similar institutional and implementation arrangements. Investment cost estimates, physical
contingencies, prices and estimates of inputs and outputs are based on actual historical data under these earlier
projects and thus are considered reliable. Technical standards of specific subprojects will be ensured through
standardized designs (including engineering aspects, technical, financial and economic feasibility, O&M, simple
environmental guidelines and cost parameters) that cover approximately 80% of subproject types normally demanded
by the communities. Field evidence demonstrates that these simple, practical standards have enhanced subproject
quality, sustainability and cost-effectiveness. All subprojects are screened by qualified staff in the STU and
communities can contract technical assistance (up to 8% of subproject value) to assist in design and implementation of
subprojects. Training programs are also being offered to develop community capacity to prepare, implement, operate
and maintain projects. During project preparation Bank specialists reviewed the quality and sustainability of a variety
of community subprojects, including water, sanitation and power subprojects funded by RPAP, and found them to be
technically sound and sustainable. This methodology will be continued under the new RPRP.
4. Institutional:
a. Executing agencies
The project will continue to be overseen by the  State Secretariat of Planning, Science and Technology
(SEPLANTEC) and administered and executed by the Company for Regional Action and Development (CAR) in
partnership with Community Associations (CAs) and Municipal Councils (MCs).
b. Project management
Day to day coordination and management of the project is fully delegated to the Bahia Technical Unit - CAR.
Resource allocation and prioritization of subprojects is undertaken by Municipal Councils, and subproject
implementation is managed and executed by community associations. Partnerships will also be established with civil
society (including NGOs) and State and Municipal public agencies to respond to communities' project
implementation needs.
CAR: is a semi-autonomous agency of the State Secretariat of Planning, Science and Technology (SEPLANTEC). It
enjoys significant administrative and financial autonomy, with a strong network of infrastructure and human resources
both at headquarters and regionally, consistent with its diverse responsibilities. These include the ongoing Rural
Poverty Alleviation Project-Bahia (Loan 3917-BR) as well as other public programs covering land reform, urban
development, and employment and income programs in the poorest rural municipalities. CAR has 15 years of
experience implementing rural development programs, including community based development, and has a proven
track record in the successful implementation of the demand-driven model used in the RPAP and replicated in the
proposed project. CAR has a staff of high caliber professionals, specializing in the preparation, analysis, evaluation
and supervision of subprojects, including Engineers (water supply, electricity (contracted), roads, bridges); Architects
(productive investments); Social Scientists (evaluation, mobilization/ organization, supervision, reporting and
evaluation); MIS Specialist (MIS management, reporting); Financial Management Specialists (accounting, budgeting,
oversight of procurement, disbursement and auditing); Economists (Financial analysis); Procurement Specialists



Page 17
(oversight of procurement procedures); and Professional Management and Coordination staff (institutional
management and operational planning). CAR has its headquarters in the State Capital of Salvador, and 16 well-
funded and equipped regional offices located in strategic regions of the State project area.
Municipal Councils: are membership organizations comprising 80% representatives of beneficiary associations and
unions, and 20% representatives of civil society and municipal government. They may be established as legally
constituted civil organizations or through Municipal decree, and have administrative and financial autonomy from the
Municipal Government. MCs have been formed and functioning since approximately 1994 after the reformulation of
the NRDP. Detailed evaluations have indicated that MCs provide a transparent and democratic forum for community
decision making about local needs and priorities. By providing a link to municipal government, the MCs play a
critical role in embedding the community based process in formal channels and are essential for building institutional
sustainability of the project. Increasingly the councils are undertaking a broader municipal planning role and many
are now routinely included in the process of establishing local government investment priorities In the new project,
councils will assume additional responsibilities, including oversight of community operation and maintenance of
investments; an increasing role in subproject approval, and as facilitators linking communities with external financial
partners and other programs. A focus of the new program will be training communities to assume these new
responsibilities. In particular, additional money will be made available for MCs to appoint technical advisors, to
mobilize communities, and provide assistance and information during implementation.
Community Associations: are legally constituted civil associations that serve as the foundation of project
implementation. They have shown, under the preceding programs, that they can be efficient and cost-effective agents
for their own development. Charging the communities with primary responsibility for the implementation, operation
and maintenance of their own subprojects has been found to enhance quality and reinforces community ownership.
The new project will continue to build on the latent capacity of community associations and their committees and
develop and reinforce it by making available funds for direct contracting of technical assistance, as well as training
programs to develop basic financial and administrative skills. For subproject-related assistance in design and
implementation, associations can contract technical assistance using up to 8% of subproject costs.
c. Procurement and financial management issues
Procurement and financial management systems have been reviewed by Bank specialists and are considered
satisfactory (see Annex 7).
5. Social:
Communities are creating the demand for the new project, and are dictating the types of subprojects to be financed,
demonstrating the high level of satisfaction with CDD delivery mechanisms. Detailed evaluations (Annex 2)
reinforce these findings. In the Mid-term Review of RPAP, and other evaluations, strong demand for subproject
investments has been observed. High levels of beneficiary satisfaction as well as strong economic impact of local
infrastructure investments were recorded.
Apart from meeting basic community investment needs, a major achievement of the program to date has been to foster
the creation of social capital within rural municipalities and their communities. This accumulation of social capital has
increased with the introduction of the more decentralized FUMAC and FUMAC-P mechanisms. This is because the
MCs have provided a new, representative and transparent forum for local government and community representatives
to discuss and prioritize investment proposals. By providing communities the opportunity to address their needs
through a genuinely participatory process of decision making and oversight, the MCs have succeeded in: (i) reducing
clientelism and political interference; (ii) strengthening the capacity of both communities and municipal governments
to select, prioritize and implement investment decisions; (iii) creating partnerships between communities, MCs and
municipal governments and more generally, increased the community voice in the use of public resources; and (iv)
fostering citizenship through increased awareness of social responsibilities of citizens, their representatives and public
authorities in community and public matters.
Experience shows that the mechanisms to be used in the proposed project (particularly FUMAC and FUMAC-P) have
promoted inclusion of all social groups. Under the RPAP, municipal councils and community associations had a
strong representation of women and minority groups. In the new project, the policies of open access to program



Page 18
benefits, and widely dispersed information regarding program rules (using the information campaigns) will continue
to ensure equitable treatment of, and access for, all potential beneficiaries.
To further increase project impact the following changes are being implemented to continue to promote and
strengthen transparency and social inclusion:
*  higher levels of funding for the poorest communities as determined by HDI indices;
*  greater emphasis on FUMAC and FUMAC-P, and minimization of PAC;
*  training of MCs in targeting, and introduction of performance incentives for reaching the poorest;
• promote sustainability by developing a strategy for linking communities to local governments, alternative funding
from financial institutions and to other programs
6. Environmental assessment:   Environmental Category [ A    [Xl B   [J C
The proposed project has been assigned a "B" environmental classification. Because of their relatively small size,
most PAC, FUMAC, and FUMAC-P subprojects would not have a significant effect on the environment. Experience
acquired during the execution of the RPAP-Bahia from 1996 to 2000, demonstrated that few subproject investments
presented adverse environmental effects. An Environmental Checklist - already incorporated into the Project
Operational Manual under the previous project - has been revised and updated for the proposed project.
In a similar manner to the approach adopted under RPAP, the project would ensure proper environmental screening
and enforcement measures, to prevent certain types of productive or infrastructure subprojects from producing
negative effects on the environment. The Operational Manual specifies key environmental criteria and screening and
enforcement procedures to be followed for each type of subproject. These criteria will be reviewed and improved for
the new project. Each subproject proposal presented by the community associations would include a simple
environmental assessment in the form of a "checklist", following a standard format. For standard subproject types,
standard drawings have been upgraded for the new project to include special design considerations for potential
environmental issues (e.g., waste disposal for manioc mills). Environmental screening at the subproject approval stage
would be the responsibility of the STU and Municipal Councils. For exceptional subproject types, for which technical
standards have not been developed, the STU would screen the subproject proposals in detail for environmental impact.
An environmental specialist will be specially retained by the STU for this purpose. This assessment and any
subsequent recommendations would be incorporated into the subproject proposal. For the FUMAC-P subprojects, the
Municipal Councils would conduct the environmental screening together with either the STU or with contracted
technical assistance, such as NGOs. The STU has identified expertise within the state for technical assistance
purposes and would include environmental education and awareness as part of its training to Municipal Councils.
Enforcement of environmental criteria would be ensured via subproject supervision by the STU and Municipal
Councils.

F: Sustainability and Risks
1. Sustainability:
Institutional sustainability: The institutional analysis of RPAP shows that by assigning greater responsibility and
influence to local level organizations and municipal govermnents, the project can successfully support decentralized
resource allocation and the creation of social capital in rural Bahia. In the new project, even greater emphasis will be
placed on linking the FUMAC and FUMAC-P councils to local municipal planning and budgeting processes and
programs, as well as alternative credit and financial services. The aim of this effort will be the graduation of
communities who have accumulated sufficient assets and organizational capacity to gain access to mainstream
financing and other services.
Sustainability of CAR is not of concern because of its experience in rural development programs, technical and
administrative capacity, autonomy, and broad involvement in other State and Federal supported programs.
Financial sustainability: Financial analysis and field investigation confirms the sustainability of the investment
subprojects funded by the project. A sample of over 8,000 community subprojects funded in 1995 (under the R-
NRDP) and in 1997/98 (under RPAP) was reviewed and it was found that 890/o of these subprojects are fully
operational to date. Analysis of productive subprojects revealed that cost recovery through user fees by beneficiary
associations is adequate to cover both operation and maintenance and replacement of the original investment long
before the end of its useful economic life.
Physical sustainability: Beneficiary participation at all stages of the subproject cycle, as well as significant levels of
community contribution (up to 25%) help to ensure subprojects are maintained. Further, the democratic process
intrinsic to FUMAC and FUMAC-P ensure better selection and prioritization of subprojects by beneficiaries,
enhancing long term sustainability.  The Project requires the establishment of community funded operation and
maintenance plans - only subprojects that have realistic maintenance plans would be approved and financed.
Subproject maintenance would be monitored by Municipal Councils and CAR during the Project.  Performance
incentives for proper operation and maintenance are included in project design.

Rural Poverty Reduction Project - Bahia
Evaluation of The Brazilian Experience with Rural Poverty Reduction
I. INTRODUCTION
Northeast Brazil, consisting of nine states, and part of a tenth, contains the single largest concentration of poverty in
Latin America. With a combined land area of 1.6 million km2 _ 16% of Brazil's total - the Northeast is home to 45
million (28%) of Brazil's 160 million people. More than 60% of all Brazilian poor, and about 70% of the country's
rural poor live in the Northeast. Of the 16.8 million in rural communities of the Northeast, 6.8 million (40%) live on
about US$1 per day - and 9.4 million people (56%) at around US$2 per day. A recent poverty review of Brazil finds
annual per-capita incomes in the Northeast (estimated at R$2,123) are only 42% of the national annual figure of
R$4,945 while in the rural Northeast, income levels are only 10% of the national average. This high incidence of
poverty in the Northeast, especially in rural areas, has made this region a priority for public development programs.
Rural development indicators for the region also reflect the lack of access to basic services. The rural Northeast has:
(a) a rate of chronic malnutrition for children under five of 31%, compared to 15% nationwide; (b) 77% of households
without piped water, compared to 48% for the rural population nationwide; (c) 37% of households without electricity,
compared to 25% for the rural population nationwide; and (d) 55% of households without access to proper sanitation
facilities, compared to 33% for the rural nationwide.2 The adult literacy rate in the Northeast is 60%, compared to
86% nationwide. Nearly half of the Northeast's rural population lives in the interior semi-arid zone. The rural poor
are small farm owners, tenants, sharecroppers, and landless laborers who face volatile climatic conditions, fluctuating
markets, skewed access to land, and almost no rural financial intermediation. The poor thus rely on subsistence
cropping of basic foods, small-scale animal husbandry, some cash crops (mainly cotton and cashew), casual
agricultural and nonagricultural work, pensions, and remittances from family members living in cities. These
circumstances result in poor social conditions and a low productivity agricultural system, with modest input use and
slow rates of technology adoption.
The State of Bahia, in particular, has the highest absolute number of households living in poverty in the Northeast.
Given its large population size, Bahia's overall poverty rate of 39.1%, jumping to 47.1% in rural Bahia, represents
more than 5 million persons, breaking down to roughly 2.8 million in rural areas, and 2.2 million in urban areas.
Nearly three-fourths of rural Bahia households lack piped water supply, 56% are without sanitation services, and
slightly more than one-half of rural households remain without electricity, compared, respectively, with 17%, 9% and
3% for urban Bahia, and 7%, 3% and 0.9% for urban Brazil as a whole.
Recent successful rural development projects - the Reformulated Northeast Rural Development Project (R-NRDP)
[1993-1996] followed by the Rural Poverty Alleviation Projects (RPAPs) [1995 - present] - have helped to alleviate
conditions, and present a promising approach to addressing persistent poverty levels.3 The combined program - the
R-NRDP (including a community-based pilot part of the Northeast Rural Development Program before its
reformulation) and the RPAPs - has successfully financed some 50,000 community-managed subprojects in over
1,500 of the 1,665 municipalities of the Northeast, providing basic services to about 1.7 million of the poorest
families, or some 7.5 million rural poor, in over 30,000 separate communities.
Although these achievements have contributed to a reduction in the growth of rural poverty in the Northeast, the sheer
scale of poverty there remains high. The poor continue to suffer from chronic malnutrition, low levels of education
and lack of access to basic water, sanitation, and electricity services. To address this rural poverty, the Government of
Brazil, in partnership with the World Bank and the Northeast States, plans to expand and consolidate the achievements
'Including the Bank co-financed Northeast Rural Development Program, particularly its reformulation in 1993, and the Rural Poverty Alleviation
Program 1995 - present.

of the R-NRDP and RPAP programs through a new series of Rural Poverty Reduction projects. Building on the
successful mechanisms employed under those previous generations, these new projects will continue to improve both
effectiveness and sustainability of impacts through adjustments to operational features reflecting lessons learned from
implementation.
Strong monitoring and evaluation, combined with intensive, locally-based supervision, have been an important facet
of the program, contributing to the depth of knowledge that exists on its performance. From March 1998 through
March 2000, the program underwent extensive evaluation comprising a series of independent reviews to assess overall
impact in achieving poverty reduction objectives. This Annex presents findings from the evaluation, as well as a
decade of implementation experience, focusing on the achievements of the most recent (and therefore most evolved)
RPAP-style projects (but also including information about the NRDP and the R-NRDP), synthesizing lessons learned
and already incorporated in the proposed successor projects.
II. THE EVOLUTION OF COMMUNITY-BASED RURAL DEVELOPMENT IN NORTHEAST BRAZIL
Community-based activities were first introduced to Northeast Brazil in 1985 as a small-scale pilot component of the
World Bank-financed Northeast Rural Development Program (NRDP). For several years following effectiveness, this
community-based component - Apoio is Pequenas Comunidades Rurais (APCR) - was the only activity under the
NRDP to disburse effectively and achieve positive results on the ground. The APCR, at a total component cost of
US$106 million, represented one of the most significant attempts of the Bank to make rural development projects
more participatory. The APCR fund made grants of up to US$10,000 to community associations in towns of less than
5,000 inhabitants. About 60% of the grants financed community-owned ventures like grain-milling facilities, seed
banks, input-supply stores, and storage facilities. Another 25% went to small works projects (e.g., road repair,
community laundries, public toilets) while the remaining 15% supported institution-building activities in rural
community associations. Relying on rural communities to organize, prioritize needs, and plan, execute and manage
subprojects, this innovative component produced results that were both encouraging and replicable, demonstrating that
by involving communities, poverty reduction could be achieved at a low per family cost. Equally important, the
APCR demonstrated the ability of municipal governments - which were not originally included as project participants
- to mobilize additional resources at a time of severe fiscal austerity.
In late 1993, drawing on lessons from the APCR and similar schemes elsewhere in Latin America, the NRDP was
reformulated into a full-scale community-based development program (R-NRDP). Significant features of the
reformulation were: (i) decentralized decision-making, (ii) state and community counterpart finding responsibilities
and (iii) delegated implementation from the Federal Government to the State and local levels. Subsequent evaluation
of the Northeast program has confirmed that not only was it an effective model for rural poverty alleviation, but also
became a key tool of the Northeast States for promoting organized decentralization, local development and
community participation.4
After field-testing the R-NRDP model for over three years, eight Northeast State Governments (Bahia, Ceara,
Maranhao, Paraiba, Pernambuco, Piauf, Rio Grande do Norte and Sergipe) scaled-up the use of the methodology and
ushered in the follow-on Rural Poverty Alleviation Projects (RPAPs). Since their inception in 1995/96, the RPAPs
have financed almost 20,000 community-managed investments comprising basic social, productive and infrastructure
services, benefiting some 1.1 million rural families, with high levels of efficiency, sustainability and demonstrable
impact on the poorest, providing improved access to services and enhanced employment opportunities.
Building on the success of this new approach to rural development, a follow-on round of Rural Poverty Reduction
Projects is proposed. These projects will consolidate gains made under the previous generations of the Northeast
program and expand the coverage of the program to all ten States, while simultaneously integrating activities of the
Municipal councils with the local government and, through more focused investment, promote asset accumulation of
the poorest.

(1995).

IIL INFORMATION SOURCES
Strong monitoring and evaluation, combined with intensive, locally-based supervision, have been an important feature
of the Northeast program. Extensive studies of the program have also evaluated project impact in achieving poverty
alleviation objectives. Data for this review were collected from a variety of sources, including:
a. Decentralized Rural Development, Enhanced Community Participation and Local Government Performance:
Evidencefrom Northeast Brazil, an evaluation of the R-NRDP and RPAP programs conducted by FAO/CP
(July 2000);5
b. Evaluation studies carried out by independent consultants contracted by STUs in six Northeast states. These
studies covered 331 municipalities, 671 communities, 3,888 families and more than 420 community
subprojects of different types financed in Bahia, Ceara, Sergipe, Pernambuco, Piaui and Rio Grande do
Norte. In Bahia, Ceara and Sergipe, both a physical performance study and project impact assessment were
completed. In Pemnambuco, Piaui and Rio Grande do Norte, baseline studies and physical performance
reviews were conducted. In all six states, these studies complemented monitoring reports (semi-annual and
annual) prepared by the STUs, covering all project activities since effectiveness. Samples for the evaluation
studies were based on the most representative subprojects financed up to early 1998 for Bahia, Ceara and
Sergipe and early 1999 for Pernambuco, Piaui and Rio Grande do Norte;
c. A community participation study, conducted by an independent consultant under the World Bank/FAO-CP
agreement in these six Northeast states;
d. Supervision missions carried out by the states, FAO and the Bank during a two-year period from March 1998
to April 2000. These missions interviewed STU technical staff and visited a large number of communities in
some 110 municipalities to interview and meet with community leaders, beneficiaries, members of FUMAC
Councils and municipal authorities (including mayors, council members, municipal secretaries). Case studies
were also prepared.
e. Implementation Completion Reports (ICRs) for the ten R-NRDP projects, which detail all aspects of project
execution, Borrower and Bank performance, and indicators related to cost-effectiveness and sustainability of
subprojects financed under the R-NRDP. Results from these ICRs were summarized and included in the Staff
Appraisal Reports for the eight RPAPs (most notably, see Annex 2 for each respective state SAR).
f  The Management Information System (MIS), which provides current data on all subprojects, including a
characterization of associations, types of subprojects, number of beneficiaries, subprograms, budgets, costs,
financial transactions, subproject status, as well as relevant data and information on technical assistance,
training and supervision reports. MIS data are updated monthly and transmitted electronically to the Bank
which, in turn, operates its own database with project data and information on all eight RPAP states. The
Program's monitoring and evaluation were cited Best Practice in the World Bank document, Measuring the
Poverty Impact of Projects in LAC (July 6, 1998);
g. More broadly, the Bank has also invested in a variety of studies and analytical work in recent years to
identify the dimensions, characteristics and causes of rural poverty in Brazil and to develop strategic options
for policies and programs. Most notable among these studies have been: (a) Brazil Poverty Assessment
(Report No. 14323, 1995); (b) State Economic Memoranda (similar to CEMs albeit at state level, SEMs
have been completed or are in progress for Ceara, Pemambuco, Bahia and other Northeast states); (c) Rural
Poverty Reduction in Brazil: Towards an Integrated Strategy (April 2001); and (d) various surveys,
evaluations and impact assessments of the R-NRDP and RPAP projects.

IV. IMPLEMENTATION RESULTS OF THE NORTHEAST PROGRAM6
a. Subprojects: Major types, costs and implementing mechanisms
Rural Northeast communities have demonstrated their strong interest and high level of demand for the program by
submitting, through end-April 2001, well over 90,000 subproject proposals for funding and implementation under the
combined programs. Based on these proposals, the Northeast States cumulatively implemented some 50,000
subprojects, implying that a little over one-half of identified needs could be met, with available resources under the
program  and after the analysis of proposals presented.  Subprojects were implemented across three types of
implementation instruments:7
State Community Schemes (PAC): The original delivery mechanism devised under the R-NRDP, and applied
also under Rural Poverty Alleviation Project (RPAP).8
Municipal Community Schemes (FUMAC): Initially piloted under the R-NRDP, FUMAC channels
subproject funds through project municipal councils, where proposals are prioritized and approved through
participatory processes.
Pilot Municipal Funds Schemes (FUMAC-P): First piloted under the RPAP, selected FUMAC councils
prioritize and approve subprojects submitted by rural communities and then finance them within the context
of an annual budget allocated to each council by the STU.
Over nearly fifteen years of implementation (including the APCR pilot which preceded the R-NRDP), the delivery
cost of the combined program has been consistently low. Overall, the average subproject cost (including community
contribution) was about US$19,000, yet within the program, the cost structure (as a function of the differing scale of
subproject investments) varied significantly. For example, APCR investments were limited to a maximum of
US$10,000, whereas under both the R-NRDP and the RPAP, the maximum was US$50,000. Notably, average
subproject cost under both the R-NRDP and the RPAP were US$24,000 and US$23,500, respectively.
Specific to the RPAP, subproject costs were remarkably similar for the different investment types (i.e., infrastructure,
productive and social), while average subproject cost by subprogram (i.e., PAC, FUMAC and FUMAC-P) varied,
with cost efficiency increasing from PAC to FUJMAC to FUMAC-P. Some 77% of subproject investments selected by
communities comprised basic rural infrastructure (e.g., water and electrification), another 20% were productive in
nature (e.g., small scale agro-processing and communal tractors), while the remaining 3% represented investments of
a social nature (e.g., day care centers or health-related house rehabilitation). While more than 100 categories are
represented in the data, rural water supply systems and rural electrification were by far the most popular types of
investments. Other popular subprojects included rural access road improvement, communal tractors, small bridges,
manioc mills, sanitation systems and small irrigation schemes. These findings were reasonably consistent across the
different subprograms - PAC, FUMAC and FUMAC-P.
b. Beneficiaries: Families, community associations and municipalities
Since its inception, the Northeast program has benefited nearly 1.7 million families.9 This represents 53% of the total
target population for the eight RPAP projects in aggregate, and about 25% of all rural families in these states.  The
gradual accumulation by some of the target population of benefits and assets under the ACPR, R-NRDP and RPAP (as
well as other programs) has a significant impact on community development (see also Technical Evaluation, Section
VI). This constitutes an important element of a strategy to graduate some of these beneficiary communities into other,
non-grant based programs (see Section V for more detailed discussion on graduation).

Page 28
Through April 2001, the combined program had subprojects implemented in over 1,500 municipalities (86% of rural
Northeast municipalities), engaging more than 30,000 community associations. Under the R-NRDP, PAC accounted
for 79% of subprojects implemented, with the remaining 21% of subprojects financed under FUMAC. The RPAP
mainstreamed the FUMAC concept, resulting in slightly more than one-half of subprojects being financed under this
subprogram; PAC accounted for about 45% of all RPAP subprojects, with an additional 4% made up of FUMAC-P
subproject activity.   In sum, the program  has evidenced a gradual yet sustained move toward increased
decentralization of project implementation as emphasis has shifted from PAC to FUMAC to FUMAC-P. Some 1,000
Municipal Councils - with 80% of membership drawn from potential beneficiary communities and 20% representing
the public sector and broader civil society - have been established and are active in program implementation.
The Rural Poverty Alleviation Program comprises eight State projects in Northeast Brazil with total Bank loans of
US$444.0 million, effective in the period from late 1995 to 1998, and with Closing Dates ranging from June 30, 2001
to June 30, 2003. The combined disbursement of the eight projects through April 30, 2001 amounted to US$382.1
million or 86% of the total. The State of Bahia has disbursed some US$103.3 million or 98.4% of a US$105.0 million
loan. State counterpart funding availability has been problem-free throughout the implementation period, indicative
of strong commitment. The State has met or exceeded most of its original targets, greatly exceeding expected
numbers of beneficiary families, municipalities reached and municipal councils - both FUMAC and FUMAC-P --
established. Since 1998, about 90% of subproject implementation has been under the FUMAC or FUMAC-P
mechanisms. Average costs per subproject and cost per beneficiary family are about 90% and 64% of overall program
averages, respectively.
V.     IMPACT ANALYSIS OF THE NORTHEAST PROGRAM
Evaluation of the Northeast program indicates that its primary objective - reduction of rural poverty - is being
efficiently achieved on a significant scale.
a. Local level
The Northeast program has made a substantial contribution to both the quality of life of the beneficiaries and the local
economy. The availability of electricity and water supply, localized improvements to feeder roads and bridges,
rehabilitation of rural schools and health posts, and the provision of community-owned productive infrastructure, have
changed the socio-economic outlook of entire communities throughout the region. Equally important, the Northeast
program is contributing, through mobilization associated with subproject execution (and coupled with training and
technical assistance) to gradual yet substantial accumulation of social capital in poor rural communities.
Socioeconomic impact
Benefits under the combined programs have included: (i) improved living conditions; (ii) improved health conditions
and productivity; (iii) increased family income; and (iv) job creation - all serving to gradually lift beneficiary families
from poverty. Prior to the program, most of the recipient rural communities suffered from lack of access to water,
electricity and other basic infrastructure. As of end-April 2001, some US$900 million have been disbursed to finance
some 50,000 community subprojects under the APCR, NRDP and RPAP. These social and infrastructure community
subprojects, the Northeast program has provided access to these previously unavailable services. Basic infrastructure
and social subprojects have also provided communities with cleaner water, better sanitary conditions, and also
resulting in significant health improvements for the recipient communities as well as savings related to reduced
medical assistance. Specific to the RPAP, an evaluation of the aggregate socioeconomic impact of the US$362
million total of community subproject investments under the RPAPs to March 2000 indicates that: (i) more than
40,000 additional permanent jobs were created, (ii) an additional 35,000 hectares were brought under cultivation, (iii)
additional sustainable income or savings of more than $80 million per annum. When the impact of the predecessor R-
NRDP was included, aggregate investments of about US$800 million through March 2000 have generated almost
100,000 additional permanent jobs, an increase in cultivated area of about 85,000 ha., and have generated additional,
sustainable annual income or savings of US$203 million.'°

At the subproject level, the socioeconomic impact of investments varies, but is evaluated briefly below according to
type - basic infrastructure, social or productive subprojects.
*  Basic Infrastructure: About 77% of subproject investments under the Rural Poverty Alleviation Program were in
basic infrastructure -rural electrification and water supply being the most important. Investments in rural
electrification provide obvious benefits in terms of access to information, knowledge and even distance learning
by radio and television, facilitating household work but also contributing to improved health for the entire family
through better food storage. There is also evidence that, when coupled with other subprojects, rural electrification
can lead to initiatives or productive activities that create jobs and increase household income (e.g., small
irrigation schemes, small businesses and agro-industries).
Similarly, water supply subprojects directly and rapidly improve families' level of well-being through provision
of good-quality water. The construction of almost 10,000 community-built and managed water supply systems
under the combined programs (to April 2001) has meant that thousands of families no longer depend on the
intermittent water trucks during drought, thousands of women no longer spend 4-5 hours daily collecting water
and large numbers of infants do not die of water-borne diseases. Analyses from the RPAP alone suggest that net
annual income/savings per rural water supply subproject were approximately US$12,000/subproject. These
income/savings are comprised largely of time savings, foregone health expenditures and increased agricultural
production. This is significantly higher than other types of infrastructure subprojects, which typically return lower
than US$2,000 per annum. Other common types of infrastructure subprojects, such as community road
improvements, telephone booths, and construction of small bridges not only improve the living conditions of
residents of small rural communities, but also facilitate the movement of people, inputs and products as well as
communications with family members who have migrated and live and work in other towns. Analysis of a
sample of over 8,000 basic infrastructure investments indicate sustained impact - 89%  of infrastructure
subprojects funded/executed in 1995/98 continued to be fully operational in March 2000.
*  Productive investments. Investment in productive activities - i.e., subprojects involving the production and/or
transformation, or processing of agricultural and non-agricultural goods - were typically demanded by
communities only after basic infrastructure needs were met. About 20% of investments under the Rural Poverty
Alleviation program were for productive activities, such as small scale agro-processing and communal tractors.
Productive investments have a relatively strong potential for generating income opportunities in the short and
medium terms, especially for projects with simple production processes and low exposure to market risks (e.g.,
manioc mills, small irrigation schemes, tractors, primary processing of corn and rice, and cashew nut).
Economic internal rates of return for productive subprojects exceeded, on average, 30% (see Annex 5).
Furthermore, these productive ventures are, in general, financially sustainable, with about three and one-half
years needed, on average, to recover the capital invested and user fees adequate to cover O&M. More complex
undertakings (e.g., clothes-making, community brick and ceramics factories) have also been successful when
packaged with technical assistance and training. For a sample of 1,820 productive subprojects funded/executed in
1995/98, some 1,580 or 86.8% were found to be in full operation in March 2000.
It is expected that the financing of productive investments will stabilize, with STUs expanding financing to
communities that have until now not benefited from infrastructure subprojects and /or from growth. Various
cases have been identified of communities that initially benefited from infrastructure or productive investments,
graduated from the program, and are now beginning productive undertakings with the assistance of conventional
sources of financing (e.g., Banco do Nordeste, Banco do Brasil), or other programs. This trend will be promoted
in the new project, with enhanced linkages to other projects/programs, credit and markets.
*  Social investments: Under the Rural Poverty Alleviation program, social subprojects (e.g., sanitation, health-
related housing improvement and social centers) have comprised 3% of total subprojects. Sanitation subprojects
(e.g., latrines, septic tanks) have improved community health. Community centers financed under the program
have served both social and productive functions (e.g., hosting various civic events, serving as sites for training).
Similarly, communal wash-houses that provide washing water for family laundry fulfill a social function while
providing a valuable service to the community. Impacts were also sustained - for a sample of 239 social
subprojects funded/executed in 1995/98, 88% of them remained operational in March 2000.



Page 30
Targeting
Effective targeting of the rural poor is crucial, given the matching grant-based nature of subproject investments.
Under the RPAP, but also under the R-NRDP, targeting has occurred at two distinct levels: (a) selection of
municipalities based on poverty level and/or other socioeconomic characteristics and (b) selection of beneficiary
communities through Municipal Council deliberations.   Furthermore, consistent with the demand-driven
characteristics of the program, prospective beneficiaries "self-select" in that community associations identify local
needs and prepare subproject proposals to address them. Populations targeted under both the R-NRDP and the RPAP
have been poor and, in general, strategies for targeting these groups seem to have produced the desired results. There
is reasonable certainty that the relatively better-off and better-organized communities did not capture a larger than
proportional share of project benefits. Targeting was somewhat less precise in municipalities where only PAC
subprojects had been implemented; the expansion of FUMAC and FUMAC-P largely resolved this difficulty, since
Municipal Councils - where community representation is strong - can make better allocation decisions due to local
knowledge of both community needs and their extent of vulnerability. The recent Rural Poverty Review for Brazil
assessed the coverage and targeting of several social programs in Brazil; it found the RPAP to be among the best
performers in terms of both coverage and targeting. Not only have the vast majority of program resources under the
RPAPs (approximately 93%) reached the final beneficiaries as direct subproject investment, but evaluations indicate
that targeting of the poorest has been effective with 75% of beneficiaries having an initial income of less than US$1
per day.
Graduation
By improving living standards and economic conditions of beneficiaries, the RPAP and the R-NRDP have stimulated
asset accumulation at both the local and household levels, an important consequence of which is that, over time,
certain communities have satisfied their basic needs and increased their socio-economic standing. Because future
project resources will be targeted to the poorest, these communities will eventually be precluded from further project
financing. Field observations suggest that the expansion of FUMAC and FUMAC-P mechanisms has led to a natural
process of community graduation by Municipal councils. For those communities which have implemented a number
of subprojects, this informal graduation entails either (i) reducing the community's priority ranking within the
municipality or (ii) excluding the community's subproject proposals. Municipal council performance in regard to
graduation needs to be more closely monitored to ensure consistency. Under the proposed project, the following will
be applied:
Graduation of communities - exit strategy. Most of the investments requested by communities in the past
(around 77%) comprised infrastructure subprojects. However, since the rural poor are generally off the radar
screen of any formal credit institution in the rural Northeast, particularly as individuals, project matching
grants for productive investments and technical assistance can be catalytic by encouraging the formation of
groups, providing some experience in the management of financial assets and income-earning activities, and
thus making them more attractive to financial institutions. Therefore, communities that presently lack access
to formal credit can qualify for one grant-based productive subproject (defined as those generating product
sold in the market), after which they will be graduated from such support, (under the R-NRDP and RPAP
there were no limits, although as a practical matter the MCs have tended to limit communities to an average
two subprojects of any kind, in order to ration scarce resources). At the same time, a major effort will be
made to link communities graduating from productive projects, to possible sources of formal credit. In
particular, the Bank of the Northeast (BN) has increasingly been seeking organized communities to which it
can provide group credit. BN and the RPAPs have already partnered in some places, albeit in an ad hoc
manner - but there is now enough positive experience that the state of Bahia and BN are interested in taking
the cooperation to another level. Therefore, agreements have been reached on information sharing and
coordination, which will be detailed in the project Operational Manual: (a) BN will have access to relevant
information from the project MIS about group credit candidates, which it will pass on to its units in charge of
credit lines and government programs in which it participates; (b) BN's local development agents will be
invited to attend Municipal Council meetings; and (c) BN will provide Bahia with feedback on project-
graduated groups to which it has extended credit, for use in project monitoring and evaluation. BN has also
undertaken to expand its testing of the Bank-financed CrediAmigo micro-credit program into rural areas.



Page 31
With regard to community infrastructure and social subprojects, graduation considerations are different.
Most of these subprojects are in the realm of core public services (water, sanitation, electrification, social
investments), and the definition of the minimum acceptable level of such services necessarily varies over
time. Grant-based support is provided because of the poverty targeting under the project. The R-NRDPs and
RPAPs demonstrated that the CDD approach to rural infrastructure and service delivery targeted to the
poorest can work, in a cost effective manner and on a large scale, while also having important impacts in
terms of social capital formation and improved local governance. Under the proposed project in Bahia (both
the initial and second phases), the state intends to expand the geographic coverage of the CDD approach, and
to encourage project Municipal Councils to proactively seek new sources of funding, and to engage in
priority-setting and decision-making over a much wider range of activities, with a view to improving the
effectiveness of local governments and the integration and overall impact of public resources directed
towards rural poverty reduction.
b. State and Municipal Levels (see also Annex 5)
Subprojects implemented under both the R-NRDP and the RPAP programs have injected significant levels of
resources into the economies of beneficiary municipalities through direct investment, revenue generation and cost
savings. At the Municipal level, the program has delivered to the rural poor cost-effective basic infrastructure and
services in a timely fashion. Evaluations indicate that, had these investments been undertaken in the traditional
manner, they would have constituted a larger burden on State and Municipal government budgets and taken longer to
complete. For example, the rural water supply subprojects in beneficiary communities have replaced recurrent
expenditures that municipalities and States have typically incurred to mitigate the often severe and protracted drought.
In Sergipe alone, it is estimated that such savings totaled more than R$500,000 annually during a year of "normal"
rainfall; in Ceara and Bahia, the amount exceeded R$1 million annually. In years of severe drought, such as 1998,
savings were at least doubled. Information from the Superintendency for the Development of the Northeast
(SUDENE) shows that between October 1998 and June 2000, total Federal, State and Municipal expenditures on
trucked water (carro pipa) in the ten Northeast states were more than R$65 million or about US$39 million. In
addition to tanker-related savings, water supply subprojects reduce municipality spending on medical supplies and
medical care by reducing the incidence of water-borne diseases.
From a fiscal standpoint, ICMS (sales tax) revenues from subprojects are expected to be small because much of the
incremental production is either self-consumed, not liable to taxation, and/or circulates in informal markets where tax
is rarely paid. However, the indirect effects of infrastructure subprojects can be large. Experience under RPAP
showed that there was a large increase in the purchase and use of domestic appliances when electricity became
available. This observation is also applicable to purchases of items such as agricultural machinery and irrigation
equipment, although these types of subprojects are not as numerous as electrification.
VI. TECHNICAL EVALUATION
Quality of investments
Technical evaluations conducted by independent consultants have found that works executed under the program were
technically satisfactory and of good quality. Beneficiaries uniformly expressed their satisfaction with the quality
(good or excellent) of materials used in construction, and regarded more than 90% of all investments as being
satisfactory. This finding was consistent for PAC, FUMAC and FUMAC-P mechanisms. From 50% to 75% of all
subprojects were considered to be adequately sized to meet beneficiaries' needs, another 13-33% were considered
under-sized, and 2-14% too large (varying according to State).
Cost-effectiveness (see also Annex 5)
In many cases, subproject investments under the Northeast program were substitutes for investments that would
normally have been made by Federal, State and Municipal governments. Evaluations show that costs of investments
implemented by communities under the Northeast program (either directly or contracted) were consistently 30-50%
lower than costs incurred by public authorities for works of equal or lesser quality. Moreover, costs were lowest
where communities executed subprojects themselves - from 10 to 40% lower than when implemented solely by
contractors they hired. Cost per beneficiary family decreased as communities moved from PAC to FUMAC.



Page 32
Cost reductions under the program were stimulated by several actions, including: (i) use of standard subproject
models; (ii) more accurate analysis of subproject proposals; (iii) inspection of works during execution; (iv) visits to
communities prior to the approval of proposals; and (v) provision of training to those involved in carrying out
procurement in the associations. Supervision observations during subproject execution and visits to communities prior
to subproject approval were incorporated into the TUs' work routines. Additionally, standardized subproject designs
and unit costs and procurement-related training on pricing for goods, works and services, facilitated the process of
subproject analysis and execution for the associations, and the work of supervision and monitoring for the TUs and the
Municipal Councils. In general, the program has proved that procurement by community associations can be very
successful and cost effective.
Sustainability (see also Annex 5)
Subproject sustainability was found to be enhanced by a sense of community ownership, by their cofinancing of
subproject costs and by communal responsibility for operation and maintenance of the investment. Recent reviews,
which sampled some 8,000 community subprojects funded from 1995 to 1997/98 found that about 90% of these
subprojects continued to be fully operational. This sustainability did not vary substantially, either in terms of
subproject completed under the R-NRDP or the RPAP, or across subproject types (i.e., infrastructure, productive,
social). Observations indicate that community associations have generally been able to establish internal rules for
charging user fees, thus ensuring the sustainability of these investments. There are some limited cases, particularly in
subprojects financed under the PAC subprogram, in which beneficiaries, despite having participated in the decision to
select the investment, are not paying regularly user fees. Incentives to minimize such occurrences and more emphasis
on FUMAC and FUMAC-P have been included in the new projects. Due to their relatively small scale, subprojects,
in general, were observed not to have a significant effect of the environment.
VII. INSTITUTIONAL EVALUATION
The Northeast program - a participatory, demand-driven mechanism addressing a large target population - involves
many actors and stakeholders. The institutional analysis, therefore, focuses on the communities themselves as the
cornerstone of the program. In particular, it assesses how the program has served to enhance social capital in
beneficiary communities and municipalities. It will also examine the performance and capacity of community
associations, municipal councils and technical units.
Social Capital
In addition to meeting basic community investment needs, a major achievement of the program to date has been to
foster social capital creation within rural municipalities and communities. Again, program evaluations indicate that
social capital has expanded on two levels under the program: (i) as the program evolved from APCR to R-NRDP and
finally under the RPAP and (ii) as the delivery mechanisms became more decentralized, from PAC to FUMAC to
FUMAC-P. This is because the Municipal councils have served as representative and transparent fora for local
government and community representatives to discuss and prioritize investment proposals. By serving as a
participatory means for communities to equitably address their collective needs, the municipal councils have
succeeded in: (i) reducing clientelism and political interference; (ii) strengthening the capacity of both communities
and municipal governments to select, prioritize and implement investment decisions; (iii) creating partnerships
between communities, municipal councils and municipal governments; (iv) increased community voice in the use of
public resources; and (v) fostering citizenship through increased awareness of social responsibilities of citizens, their
representatives and public authorities in community and public matters.
Nearly 1,000 municipalities have established project Municipal councils under the program. Approximately 30% of
these councils (in which community representatives have an 80% majority) have progressed beyond simple subproject
decision-making into popular participation fora for municipal planning and allocation of non-project resources - a
telling indication of the gains in social capital at the municipal level. In addition, approximately 25% of community
associations are leveraging social- capital acquired under the Program to access other non-RPAP investment financing
previously unavailable. Although intangible and difficult to quantify, there is a palpable difference in self-respect and
confidence in many RPAP communities.



Page 33
A community participation study (Section III) - an analysis based on a representative sample of 225 community
associations - revealed that from the advent of the R-NRDP (1993) up to the implementation of the RPAP (1998-
2000), social capital accumulation had increased by some 41%."1 A particularly noteworthy result of this analysis was
that social capital remained constant for the PAC approach, increased some 43% for FUMAC and rose by 76% for
FUMAC-P, clearly demonstrating that empowerment of communities through devolution of decision-making and,
particularly financial management responsibilities, leads to more effective and genuinely demand-driven rural
development. Indeed, one of the most subtle feats of the RPAP has been that gradually all states have become
convinced of the superiority of FUMAC over PAC. Given the continued emphasis on the FUMAC and FUMAC-P
subprograms, it is expected that the program's rate of social capital formation will continue to increase. Institutional
sustainability will also be ensured as links are strengthened between Municipal councils, local governments, rural
communities and other external partners, introducing these actors and stakeholders to a new way of doing business.
Community Associations
Field observations, and the community participation study mentioned above, indicate that the community associations
created under the program have generally performed well. Collective responsibilities are typically met by the
members (e.g., appointment of office holders, payment of dues or user fees), particularly in better organized groups.
While there exists the potential for political influence in the organization of these community associations, the
outcome has been generally favorable as mayors, STUs and NGO agents facilitated the spread of information about
the program and provided the conditions necessary for communities to capitalize on program benefits which met their
basic needs. Community association membership was found to be inclusive, with an increasing proportion of women
undertaking leadership functions.  Another important observation has been that subprojects implemented by
associations have tended to benefit entire local communities, and not just association members.
Uniformly across the program, community associations share a common need for technical assistance. Not only is
this essential for the organizational development of newly-formed associations, but it is also needed to assist the
associations during the entire subproject cycle, from preparation to implementation and operation and maintenance of
subprojects. Funds are available under the program for community contracting of technical assistance, supplemented
by similar provision from Municipal councils and the STU."2 Technical assistance will become increasingly
important as the program expands, and weaker communities not yet participating in the program gradually become
involved. Better access to organizational and management training will also contribute to the sustainability of both
community associations and subprojects.
Municipal Councils
Since the advent of the R-NRDP, the formation of Municipal councils - both FUMAC and FUMAC-P - has been an
important contribution of the Northeast program. Evaluations indicate that these councils, as fora of democratic
discussion, have (i) increased transparency, (ii) reduced political interference, (iii) improved targeting, and (iv)
contributed significantly to social capital formation in rural communities.   Furthermore, FUMAC-P councils
performed even better than FUMAC councils, confirming the benefit of increased decentralization in program
delivery. The setting of budget envelopes for the Municipal councils (under FUMAC-P) makes for more realistic
priority-setting than in respective FUMACs, contributing to an increased capacity by communities in these councils to
identify, plan and implement subprojects. These stronger FUJMAC-P councils also were even more effective catalysts
for increasing community organization and thus social capital.
Experience on the ground shows that Municipal councils are becoming an integral part of local government planning
processes, indicating that the initial risk of FUMAC and FUMAC-P councils being parallel structures to local
governments (with a life span tied to the program) is actually being overcome. Councils are increasingly being
recognized by both the local population and their elected mayors as valid representatives of communities and civil
society, and as able partners of local administrations in fostering and sustaining municipal development. 13
" Van Zyl, Sonn, Costa (FAO/CP evaluation): Decentralized Rural Development, Enhanced Community Participation and Local Government
Performance: Evidence from Northeast Brazil (July 2000). Measurements were based on a compound index developed for the program, and
referred to as the social capital index (CPI).
12 Typically, up to 8% of total subproject cost can be earmarked for community contracting of technical assistance
" As frequently observed in the field, the most insightful mayors (prefeitos) have now begun to understand that working in alliance with
communities and Councils, in addition to the gains mentioned here, also makes good political sense.



Page 34
Obviously, progress has been faster in some states (e.g., Rio Grande do Norte, Bahia and Piaui), but even in the other
Northeastern states, both FUMAC and, in particular, FUMAC-P are slowly but firmly taking hold.'4   In
approximately 30% of the councils, decisions are made not just on program-related allocations, but also on priorities
for local municipal resources. If carefully nurtured, not only with the right mix of technical assistance and funding
support but also by insisting that clear and transparent rules continue to apply to the functioning of the Councils, this
model may well become one of the most valuable and durable institutions for rural development in the Northeast.
Over the course of program implementation, both the State Governments and the Bank have monitored the progress of
the Municipal councils and, as a result, have introduced a series of adjustments to improve their performance and to
increase their ability to generate social capital. Among these adjustments are: (i) increases in the relative number of
community representatives on the Councils and continued diversification of council membership; (ii) expansion of the
FUMAC-P experience; (iii) provision of more effective training and orientation for Municipal council members; (iv)
increased responsibilities of Municipal councils to expand their role in providing technical assistance and support to
communities; and (v) advice to councils on other sources of funds, including credit, to meet other community
interests. Municipal councils are being encouraged to take a wider view of municipal development, to define criteria
for community graduation and to assume the political and social burden for prioritizing community proposals. The
councils have also been endowed with more secure sources of revenue for their operation, so that they can accomplish
their tasks without total dependence on municipal resources. Community associations have been made aware of their
responsibility to help in sustaining and guaranteeing the independence of their Municipal council. Finally, analysis
suggests that the conditions whereby the councils can improve their performance include: (i) political inclusiveness,
(ii) stronger community representation and (iii) awareness of the relative scarcity of resources.
Technical Units
Throughout its history, the Northeast program has been administered in each state by a Project Technical Unit (STU)
which in eight Northeast states is under the State Secretariat of Planning (SEPLAN).15 The STUs are the vehicle for
project administration and for communication with the Bank and the State Government. It is also the project's main
liaison with the FUMAC and FUMAC-P Municipal Councils and, in PAC municipalities, with the community
associations. The institutional set-up and performance of the STUs across the Northeast states is diverse and varied.
In general, all the STUs show satisfactory levels of technical capacity, and have received adequate levels of technical
assistance and training from contracted/external providers such as Instituto Interamericano de Cooperaci6n para la
Agricultura (IICA). Increasing decentralization, partnerships with public and private entities, and the build-up of both
capacity and social capital in rural communities and their Municipal councils have allowed both communities and
councils to assume greater responsibilities - including for supervision, monitoring and training -and thus imply a
potentially much smaller role for the STUs in the future. With few exceptions, the STUs have benefited from the
commitment and budgetary support of State governments: sound disbursement performance has been a notable feature
of the RPAPs. STUs have, for the most part, implemented their functions efficiently, with few bureaucratic
bottlenecks. The STUs' performance in the execution of training activities for associations and FUMAC and
FUMAC-P councils, is considered satisfactory. Under the new projects, this function will be improved, and training
made more relevant and timely, by increasingly devolving these responsibilities to Municipal councils.
The extent to which individual STUs are collaborating with public and private entities to leverage better project
implementation is again variable. Most of the STUs have formed strong relationships with the State leadership, with
the FUMAC and FUMAC-P councils and with municipal mayors. While there is widespread and active participation
from rural workers' unions in community mobilization, organization and other activities, formal NGO participation in
the implementation has been relatively modest. The notable exception is Rio Grande do Norte, where the economic
and social benefits of active, dynamic NGO involvement are clear and measurable. This situation is changing
however, and STUs are proactively seeking greater involvement and participation of NGOs.
'4 While Alagoas did not participate in the RPAP phase of the Northeast program, the state nonetheless has fostered a similar model on the basis of
the R-NRDP - Municipal Councils for Sustainable Development - that has much in common with the FUMAC and FUMAC-P models.
'5 In the case of Ceara, the STU is under the State Secretariat for Rural Development (SDR). In Alagoas, the STU is located within the State
Secretariat of Agriculture, Supply and Fisheries.

World Bank Recife Office
The World Bank Office in Recife is fundamental to the coordination and supervision of the RPAPs and comprises
three task managers dedicated exclusively to working with the Northeast states. By delegating supervision activities
to this local office (including procurement reviews and field visits), Bank support is better tailored to the decentralized
structure of the Northeast program. In terms of supervision, the Recife office will continue to play a similar role as in
the past. In addition, the Bank will undertake, as part of its strategic updating of all work in Northeast Brazil, a yearly
review of how the implementation of the RPRP program is contributing to integrate broader issues of poverty
reduction in the Northeast.
VIII.  LESSONS LEARNED AND REFLECTED IN THE PROPOSED PROJECT DESIGN
*  Decentralization of fiscal and investment decision-making and implementation from federal to state and local
governments, to community organizations, ensures efficient program administration and superior outcomes.
Experience shows that decentralized community-driven approaches reduce bureaucracy, eliminate
administrative bottlenecks and reinforce accountability for project performance by placing decision-makers
near beneficiaries. Under the new project the existing, decentralized institutional structure will be further
devolved, with increased delegation of duties to Municipal Councils and greater utilization of STU regional
offices to promote more responsive and local level monitoring, data collection, coordination, and supervision.
*  Participation by beneficiaries in the selection, financing, execution, and O&M of subprojects has ensured
that investments meet genuine community needs, led to cost savings, and has increased community
'ownership' leading to improved sustainability of investments. This methodology will be continued under
the new project.
-  Poverty targeting mechanisms that are simple, verifiable and based on objective criteria, can foster
transparency, minimize political interference in project resource allocation and ensure that project resources
reach the poorest areas. Poverty targeting mechanisms under the RPAP to date have been notably effective in
reaching the poorest rural populations in the Northeast. About 84% of the program's beneficiary population
are small farmers and rural laborers living in remote, low density areas with acute deficiencies in access to
basic infrastructure and services. A significant additional population resides in rural areas directly adjacent to
the urban periphery of municipal centers, where headcount poverty measures are lowest. Experience with
project Municipal Councils demonstrates that communities themselves are the best-positioned and informed
to target effectively. Under the new project, broad targeting will be undertaken (i) at the municipal level, with
indicative budgets assigned to each Municipal Council, differentiated according to poverty indices; and (ii) at
the community- level, by the Municipal Councils. Communities which improve their relative socioeconomic
conditions significantly through project investments would be encouraged to seek non-project financing to
meet development needs. In field observations of RPAP, Municipal Councils were found to already be
following this practice, either (i) reducing priority ranking and/or (ii) excluding requests from those
communities that had already received several subprojects.
*  Supervision has been found to be an indispensable determinant of success and sustainability. It needs to be
reinforced at all levels and involve local entities closest to the communities, particularly Municipal Councils
and NGOs. Under the new project supervision responsibilities will be increasingly devolved to MCs, who
will be supported with training and technical assistance. Measures will also be taken to modernize all
Councils, gradually providing computers and information technology to all of them.
*  A user-friendly monitoring and evaluation system facilitates the subproject evaluation process, provides
feedback and necessary information to improve targeting and efficiency, and is an essential management and
planning tool. Under the new project important revisions will be undertaken to strengthen the MIS (Section
C.4 under "Monitoring and Evaluation Arrangements') to improve real time monitoring of the entire project
cycle. A more comprehensive impact evaluation component will also be introduced to measure income,
welfare and social capital gains.



Page 36
*  Dissemination of "best practices", such as experiences with NGOs in Rio Grande do Norte, EMATERCE in
Ceara, FUMAC Councils in Bahia and Sergipe, and FUMAC-P in Pernambuco can hasten learning and
reward innovation. Under the new project, exchanges between states, municipalities and communities will
be expanded further, using more frequent training seminars, and workshops.
*  Standardization of subproject documents, technical designs and unit costs simplifies the subproject
preparation and evaluation process, improves the quality of subprojects, facilitates the procurement of goods
and works, prevents over-design and enables participation by poorer communities. The existing database of
standard designs and documentation have been reviewed, technically updated where necessary, and further
expanded for the new project.
*  Environmental protection criteria:  Experience demonstrates, that because of their small scale, most
subprojects do not have a significant effect on the environment. Nevertheless, the detailed environmental
checklist developed under RPAP will be maintained and has been updated for the proposed project. Where
environmental issues are a concern, standard subproject designs have been developed and will continue to be
used by communities and MCs during subproject implementation. Further, an environmental specialist will
be maintained at the STU to provide additional technical assistance on environmental matters as well as
provide training to increase environmental awareness of MCs and community groups.
*  Technical assistance enhances the ability of community associations and MCs to identify, prepare and
implement subprojects, thereby augmenting their capacity to compete for investment funds. Technical
assistance needs to be targeted to weaker municipalities to improve their planning, management and financial
capacity to participate in the project. Locating and/or developing sources of technical assistance in rural
areas requires significant attention and needs to be monitored at the local level. Under the new project,
increased attention will be placed on training at the community level - funds will be made available for the
appointment of 'technical advisors' to be recruited by each municipal council. These advisors will be
responsible for managing and coordinating local technical and training needs. Increasing efforts will also be
placed on more meaningful involvement of civil society (e.g., NGOs and other civil and church groups) -
particularly with respect to increasing the flow of information, mobilizing the poorest groups and supporting
training activities at the community level.
A system of checks and balances, clearly-defined and well-disseminated, is essential to ensure proper use of
funds and sound targeting of resources. Rules and procedures for such a system, including guidelines for
performance incentives and penalties, have been reviewed and updated and are detailed in the Project
Operational Manual. Performance incentives will include promoting better-performing FUMAC Councils to
FUMAC-P; increasing Councils' indicative budget envelope; increasing the number of investments or
investment volume permitted to a community association; or incentives for environmental or technologically
innovative investments. Penalties would attach to cases of mis-management and diversion of funds and
include removal from eligibility to participate, reduced availability of funds, demotion from FUMAC-P to
FUMAC, and/or judicial penalties where appropriate. In addition to penalties, Municipal Councils include
participation of local NGOs (i.e., Rural Workers' Union, the Church), representatives of public ministries and
municipal officials, and Council meetings are publicly announced and open to broad participation. Finally,
the project is installing computers in the Councils, whose role will be to publicize Council decisions on their
own and the Technical Unit's webpage. All of the above are designed to boost and institutionalize
transparency.
* Minimize use of the PAC approach, particularly since the FUMAC and FUMAC-P sub-components have
clear advantages with respect to targeting, sustainability and social capital formation in poor rural
communities. Under the new project, PAC expenditure will not exceed 10% of total community subproject
investments.
* Productive subprojects should be subjected to rigorous selection, preparation, technical assistance and
supervision criteria. Under the new project, a 'one-shot' matching grant will be provided to eligible
productive investments that (i) provide services for a large number of community members; (ii) whose
collective use is regulated by strict operational guidelines (regulamento de uso); and (iii) for which operation



Page 37
and maintenance is assured by charging adequate user fees to both association members and non-members.
Revised procedures for productive subprojects are outlined in the new Project Operational Manual, as are
arrangements to facilitate access to formal credit by graduating communities.
* Broaden role of municipal councils in local planning, by promoting greater integration between local
governments and project municipal councils, and providing information to councils on other programs and
alternative sources of grant and credit financing. Field observations indicate that over 30% of project
Municipal Councils already participate in some prioritization of other (non-project) resources. If carefully
nurtured, not only with the right mix of technical assistance, information and funding support, but also by
insisting that clear and transparent rules continue to apply to the functioning of the Councils, this democratic
forum may well become one of the most valuable and durable institutions for rural development in the
Northeast.

Brazil
Rural Poverty Reduction Project - Bahia
Detailed Project Description
Project Component A - Community Subprojects (US$67.5 million or 90% of total project costs):
The project would provide matching grants directly to rural community associations to finance priority, small-scale
investments identified by community groups (up to US$50,000 each).  It is expected that approximately 3,500
subprojects will be financed under this component. This will comprise a broad range of subproject investments
including infrastructure (e.g. rural electrification, local road improvements and water supply), social investments
(e.g., health-related house improvement, day care centers, school or health post rehabilitation) and productive
subprojects (such as small-scale community agro-processing, communal tractors and minor irrigation schemes).
Subproject selection shall be demand-driven, however an indicative breakdown of investment types, based on
historical program data suggest approximately 70%  of financing shall be used for infrastructure; 20%  for social
activities and 10% for productive investments.
Subproject proposals for all forms of investment would observe standard procedures, documentation and technical,
economic, environmental and sustainability criteria as set forth in a detailed Project Operational Manual. This
Operational Manual incorporates modifications, reflecting the lessons learned during the implementation of the
Rural Poverty Alleviation Project-Bahia (Loan 3917-BR). A short negative list' of subproject types ineligible for
financing will be enforced, with particular emphasis on the application of rigorous eligibility criteria for productive
subprojects to ensure proper targeting, and financial sustainability of this form of investment2, also to be included in
the Project Operational Manual. During negotiations, the Bank reviewed a complete revised draft of the Operational
Manual, and assurances were provided by the Borrower that all project components and subprojects would be
executed in accordance with this ManuaL Adoption of this modified Operational Manual is a condition of loan
effectiveness.
The identification, preparation and implementation of all subprojects financed under the project will be the
responsibility of the beneficiary rural communities. Three different delivery mechanisms - incorporating increasing
degrees of decentralization - distinguish how the subprojects are approved and financed:
*   State Community Schemes (PAC). Under the PAC subprogram, rural communities submit their investment
proposals directly to the State Technical Unit (STU), which screens and approves them and releases funds to the
beneficiary associations. Whereas this was the predominant arrangement under the earlier R-NRDP projects, it
has receded in importance as decentralization from the State to local levels has progressed. At the start of the
RPAP projects, it was expected that about one-third of community proposals would be processed under the
PAC, but the actual share decreased steadily during implementation, in favor of the other two modalities
described below. Under the proposed new RPRP project for Bahia, the PAC will be retained as an option to
which communities may occasionally resort in cases where Municipal Councils are not functioning properly,
but it is expected to account for no more than 10% of all subprojects (up to US$6.7 million of total community
subproject costs).
*   Municipal Community Schemes (FUMAC). Under this subprogram, decision-making on investment proposals
is delegated by the State to project Municipal Councils, composed of community members and representatives
of civil society and municipal authorities. At least 80 percent of Council voting members are potential project
beneficiaries. The Municipal Councils discuss, seek to build consensus on priorities and approve community
proposals, in the context of an indicative annual budget amount determined by the state. After the Councils'
recommendations are reviewed by the STU for consistency with guidelines in the project Operational Manual,
Those subprojects ineligible for funding include production ofalcohol, tobacco and drugs, churches, and ficilities for political activities.
2 Eligible productive subprojects would be those which provide services which benefit a large number of community members and for which a
fee is charged for operation and maintenance. Productive subprojects, as with infrastructure and social subprojects, must be property ofthe
association asa whole and not of select members. For each type of productive subproject, a set of operational guidelines (regulamento de uso),
developed by the STU, would be provided to the association for adoption. In addition, each subproject proposal must identify the source of
technical assistance for subproject implementation and subsequent operation.

funds are disbursed directly to the community associations. This became the dominant subprogram under the
RPAP and will remain so under the RPRP, accounting for about 60% (US$40.6 million) of total community
subproject costs.
*  Pilot Municipal Community Funds (FUMAC-P). The FUMAC-P is a more decentralized variant of FUMAC
and was piloted under the RPAP with high-performing Municipal Councils. The STU establishes an annual
budget envelope, according to a distribution formula based on clear and measurable criteria (rural population,
poverty levels and previous year's performance). Based on this budget, Municipal Councils submit an Annual
Operating Plan (Plano Operativo Anual) for STU review. Upon approval, funds are transferred to the Council,
which is then responsible for managing their distribution to community associations and assisting them with
implementation of subprojects. Although FUMAC-P was initially expected to account for only about 12% of
community investments under the RPAP, it quickly grew in popularity and more Municipal Councils proved
capable of taking it on than originally anticipated. It is expected that under the new RPRP project, 30% of
total component costs (US$20.2 million) would be carried out under the FUMAC-P subprogram.
Promotion. Each subcomponent described above (i.e. PAC, FUMAC and FUMAC-P) represents a greater degree
of decentralization of decision-making and resource allocation responsibilities. As groups of communities become
more organized they are 'promoted' from PAC to FUMAC to FUMAC-P, gradually gaining greater control over
investment planning that goes beyond their specific community subproject. Communities with limited capacity,
and/or those communities that reside within municipalities that lack either the capacity, or political will, to adopt
FUMAC or FUMAC-P approaches, may choose to enter the program through PAC. Other communities/
municipalities that are better organized, and/or have had experience with PAC, and are receptive to participatory
decision-making processes, enter FUMAC. A Municipal Council is formed and resource allocation decisions start
being made at the local level.3 Once the Municipal Council demonstrates effectiveness in prioritization of demands
and subproject supervision and a capacity to manage resources, the municipality is promoted from FUMAC to
FUMIAC-P, and henceforth the actual resources are administered at the local level by the Municipal Council based
on locally-determined investment planning. This institutionalization of the participatory process has been shown to
protect MCs from political fluctuation, and eventually leads to stronger partnerships between communities, their
Municipal Councils and their respective municipal govermments in determining the use of public resources.
Given the overwhelmingly positive response to FUMAC under the RPAP, it is expected that the need for the PAC
subcomponent would diminish over the course of project implementation, with the FUMAC and FUMAC-P
subcomponents gradually expanding. The existence of PAC is continued only to facilitate participation in the
project of those communities within weaker municipalities which have failed to adopt the FUMAC or FUMAC-P
approach. Flexibility would be built into the project to reallocate funds among subcomponents to accommodate the
expansion of FUMAC and FUMAC-P as implementation proceeds.
Graduation. Most of the investmnents requested by communities in the past (around 77%) comprised infrastructure
subprojects. However, since the rural poor are generally out of the radar screen of any formal credit institution in
the rural Northeast, particularly as individuals, project matching grants for productive investments and technical
assistance can be catalytic by encouraging the formation of groups, providing some'experience in the management
of financial assets and income-earning activities, and thus making them more attractive to financial institutions.
Therefore, communities that presently lack access to formal credit can qualify for one grant-based productive
subproject, after which they will be graduated from such support, (under the R-NRDP and RPAP there were no
limits, although as a practical matter the MCs have tended to limit communities to an average two subprojects of any
kind, in order to ration scarce resources). At the same time, a major effort will be made to link communities
graduating from productive projects, to possible sources of formal credit. In particular, the Bank of the Northeast
(BN) has increasingly been seeking organized communities to which it can provide group credit. BN and the
RPAPs have already partnered in some places, albeit in an ad hoc manner - but there is now enough positive
experience that the state of Bahia and BN are interested in taking the cooperation to another level. Therefore,
agreements have been reached on information sharing and coordination, which will be detailed in the project
Operational Manual: (a) BN will have access to relevant information from the project MIS about group credit
candidates, which it will pass on to its units in charge of credit lines and government programs in which it
3 Under the RPAP in Bahia, 370 FUMAC Municipal Councils were formed, of which 31 are FUMAC-P. These Councils will continue under the
proposed project, with additional Councils being upgraded to FUMAC-P.

participates; (b) BN's local development agents will be invited to attend Municipal Council meetings; and (c) BN
will provide Bahia with feedback on project-graduated groups to which it has extended credit, for use in project
monitoring and evaluation. BN has also undertaken to expand its testing of the Bank-financed CrediAmigo micro-
credit program into rural areas.
With regard to community infrastructure and social subprojects, graduation considerations are different. Most of
these subprojects are in the realm of core public services (water, sanitation, electrification, social investments), and
the definition of the minimum acceptable level of such services necessarily varies over time. Grant-based support is
provided because of the poverty targeting under the project. The R-NRDPs and RPAPs demonstrated that the CDD
approach to rural infrastructure and service delivery targeted to the poorest can work, in a cost effective manner and
on a large scale, while also having important impacts in terms of social capital formation and improved local
governance. Many project Municipal Councils have thus far limited communities to one or two subprojects, to
ensure equity in access to scarce resources.  Under the proposed project in Bahia (both the initial and second
phases), the state intends to expand the geographic coverage of the CDD approach, and to encourage project
Municipal Councils to proactively seek new sources of funding, and to engage in priority-setting and decision-
making over a much wider range of activities, with a view to improving the effectiveness of local governments and
the integration and overall impact of public resources directed towards rural poverty reduction.
Targeting. The beneficiaries of RPRP are the poorest rural communities in the 407 municipalities of the project
area (in which 92% of the municipalities have a low Human Development Index (HDI) of less than 0.5).4 The
poorest 170 municipalities (i.e., with the lowest relative HDI ranking), will be allocated the sum of R$59.5 million
(averaging R$350,000 per municipality). For the remaining 237 municipalities, the sum of R$59.25 million will be
allocated, averaging R$250,000 per municipality (see Table A for key features of priority municipalities). At the
community level however, the principal mechanism for targeting is community-based - it relies on the Municipal
Councils' prioritization process to allow community themselves (through their majority representation on these
councils) to determine where project resources will be best applied based on their first-hand knowledge of
community socioeconomic conditions and local investment needs. The effectiveness of this methodology will be
assured by the establishment of clear and transparent rules and procedures for the Councils' functioning. Increased
decentralization of subproject selection through the expanded FUMAC and FUMAC-P programs is expected to
further strengthen the project's capacity to reach the most needy communities in the project area. Continual
implementation and revision of the information campaign for the project will also be used to expand opportunities
for participation of the poorest communities in the target area. This information on project eligibility and
procedures will be targeted to potential beneficiary communities to create a level playing field for access to project
funds and to stimulate demand from potential beneficiaries across the state. Some communities already have
significant levels of organization, either traditionally or from previous development projects in the area, and are
poised to benefit immediately from the project. However, for those less organized communities, the project, through
its institutional development component, would actively extend mobilization assistance through the services of
NGOs or accredited agents who know the communities well and can serve as catalysts for organization (refer
component B described below).
In order to be eligible to receive funding under the project - in compliance with Brazilian Law - beneficiaries must
form  legally-constituted civil associations (or 'community associations').  Disbursements to the beneficiary
associations would occur through agreements (convenios) with the STU and/or project Municipal Councils, as per
model agreements developed under RPAP. These agreements have been updated and included in the revised
Operational Manual for the new project. Beneficiary associations will be required to contribute to subproject costs,
either in cash, kind or labor, and will be responsible for the operation and maintenance (O&M) of the investments.
The minimum level of contributions expected from the beneficiaries, municipalities and the State Government is
specified in a cost-sharing matrix detailed in the Project Operational Manual.
Project Component B - Institutional Development (US$4.5 million or 6% of total project costs):
The Institutional Development component will finance technical assistance and training, sufficient for each group
participating in project implementation to acquire the capabilities needed to effectively carry qut its responsibilities.
United Nations Human Development Index, a composite index which measures economic and social development. For more information on
HDI ranking of municipalities, see Table A.

This component will also finance the contracting of consultants and other entities to assist the STU in monitoring,
supervision and evaluation tasks, and will provide technical assistance services to support State level modernization
and reform. This project component will also support ongoing, successful piloting of the use of information
technology by community associations and MCs to increase transparency by making available, in real time,
information about the program itself, as well as using the internet to connect communities directly to markets, both
in Brazil and internationally.
Using the demand-driven implementation mechanisms described in Component A, the project consolidates
participatory institutions and processes at the municipal and community levels. In this process, well-organized
communities with sound, carefully prepared proposals are provided with financial support for investments, and
likewise, FUMAC Municipal Councils which demonstrate effective decision-making capacity are promoted to
FUMAC-P and rewarded with their own investment budget.
To encourage this process and reinforce the decentralized implementation framework, technical assistance and
training will be provided for community associations, Municipal Councils, and the STU, as well as other entities
participating in the project. Types of training and assistance will include support to communities in organization,
subproject preparation and execution, as well as operation and maintenance techniques. Assistance will be provided
to MCs to improve decision-making capacities, and to create capacity for investment planning and financial
administration. At the STU level training will also be provided to enhance project coordination and supervision
skills. Also, because the fiscal situation of the State affects both project implementation and state counterpart
funding, technical assistance will be provided at the state level to analyze issues surrounding the reform of the State
and to identify measures to improve the State's capacity to address the inherent causes of its fiscal situation. The
instruments for achieving these various forms of capacity building will include a combination of workshops,
technical exchanges, on-site training, and more traditional technical assistance, drawing upon local expertise within
the state - technical consultants, universities, NGOs, and other local service providers-- as well as national and
international technical assistance agencies. To this effect, the component would finance consultant services, training
materials and courses, seminars, workshops, related studies and related operational costs.
The implementation of the institutional development component would be decentralized, and the provision of and
accountability for technical assistance and training would occur increasingly at the local level. In particular, project
Municipal Councils will play a critical role in overseeing the capacity-building activities for community associations
in their jurisdictions. . Technical assistance will increasingly be provided by MCs, and a local technical advisor will
be competitively recruited for this purpose under the new project. Municipal Councils, provided with model terms
of reference prepared by the STU, will contract technical assistance based on programs agreed with the STU, and
then release funds for that purpose. Institutional development activities can be broadly categorized into five areas:
a) mobilization assistance and training for participating communities. Assistance would be organized and
contracted by the STU and Municipal councils, to support the organization and strengthening of community
associations, identification of viable investments, subproject preparation, and operation and maintenance of
investments;
b) capacity-building programs for Community Associations and Municipal Councils. Organized by the STU,
these programs will include intensive training on the role of Municipal Councils, explanation of Operational
Manual guidelines, techniques for subproject evaluation and supervision, as well as related topics such as
environmental assessment of subprojects, participatory planning and financial management. Under the new
project all MCs and community associations, with approved subprojects, will be required to participate in
mandatory 'introductory training' covering the above-mentioned topics. In addition, all MCs will be gradually
equipped with computers to assist them in performing their expanding functions;
c) specialized skills training for all participating entities. Based on needs, local providers would be contracted by
the STU, Municipal Councils and groups of community associations to provide expert advice and "on-the-job
training", in areas such as investment-related technical support, the use of standard designs, monitoring
techniques, and financial management;
d) technical assistance for State reform. The Secretariat of Planning (SEPLAN), will have access, through the
STU, to technical assistance funds for consultant services, studies and training required for administrative and
other reforms aimed at modernization of the State. During project preparation, agreements were reached with



Page 45
the State on the content and implementation arrangements for this Technical Assistance subcomponent, to
which it was agreed to dedicate US$0.5 million; and
e) workshops and seminars for the Municipal Councils and beneficiary associations, to exchange experience
under the project. These "best practice" exchanges may also extend to seminars to forge links between all
STUs of the ten Northeastern states, and to disseminate successful experiences across states.
Project Component C - Administration, Monitoring and Evaluation (US$3.0 million or 4% of total project cost):
This component would support overall project coordination and supervision and would help to strengthen the
effectiveness and quality of project operations. It would finance the incremental operating costs of the STU
(excluding salaries), which is responsible for overall coordination of project activities in partnership with
community associations and with FUMAC and FUMAC-P municipal councils. As part of its duties, the STU will
conduct an ongoing statewide information campaign to continuously disseminate information about the project and
its guidelines to all potential beneficiary communities, thereby increasing awareness, transparency and participation
in the program. For this campaign, the project would finance: (a) local technical assistance in the design and
development of the campaign; and (b) the implementation costs, including appropriate, simplified posters, leaflets,
radio spots and videos. The preparation of a statewide information campaign, acceptable to the Bank; would be a
condition of loan effectiveness.
Given the importance of supervision to the overall impact of the program, project supervision will be intensified
under the project and, accordingly, and half of its cost will be financed under this component. Project supervision
will provide the STU with the necessary information on project performance to make managerial decisions, such as
the provision of technical assistance or training, the correction of departures from project guidelines, and the
promotion of project municipalities from FUMAC to FUMAC-P. In line with the increasing emphasis on
decentralization under the new project, the responsibilities for project supervision at the local level will be
increasingly devolved to MCs with the STU focusing on supervision of the MCs, 'spot-checks' of community
associations to verify performance, and overall project coordination.  Supervision activities to be financed under
the project include operational expenses for field visits and subcontracted services from NGOs and other
participating agencies.
This component would also finance the establishment of a monitoring system, including the maintenance and use of
a Management Information System (MIS). To function as an efficient management tool, the project MIS, originally
designed under the NRDP, would be improved and made more user-friendly and performance-oriented. It would be
migrated on-line to allow regional offices to enter data and monitor real time flow of subprojects. The MIS would
be expanded to contain key technical, financial and socio-economic information on subprojects (planned and actual),
as well as cost and other physical indicators, and quantitative variables for impact monitoring. MIS-generated
project reports, including monthly disbursement reports and semi-annual progress reports, would facilitate
subproject tracking and generate appropriate feedback on project performance. Project performance and impact
indicators would be regularly updated to take stock of project implementation and will be included in the semi-
annual progress reports. A Project Implementation Plan and a matrix of Project Performance Indicators were
finalized and agreed during project preparation. This component would finance operating costs for monitoring
activities, as well as finance experts in information technology and project management: (a) to improve the MIS;
and (b) to collect and analyze data on cost indicators and physical parameters from the most frequently approved
types of subprojects, so as to calculate a range of values for these indicators and to adjust subproject eligibility
criteria accordingly. These adjustments are incorporated into the updated Project Operational Manual.
Finally, the project would finance consultant services to develop and implement studies to evaluate the impact of the
subprojects and provide feedback to improve project operations, including the following: (a) annual physical
performance reviews, to assess the quality and sustainability of common types of subprojects financed by the
project, including reviews of community-based procurement; (b) an implementation review, carried out at the mid-
term, to include beneficiary consultations so as to generate an evaluation of project performance and impact as
perceived by the ultimate beneficiaries; and (c) a comprehensive impact evaluation, which would include a baseline
evaluation to establish indicators of socio-economic impact and a follow-on final evaluation of the project using
these indicators to measure (i) aggregate project impact on social indicators; (ii) cost/benefit of demand driven vs
conventional approaches to rural development and (iii) restudy household included in RPAP Mid Term Review.

During project preparation, an execution chronogram was agreed. Terms of Reference for the aforementioned
baseline study and an overall evaluation framework, both acceptable to the Bank, would be a condition of loan
effectiveness.
Project Coordination: The State Technical Unit (CAR) supported by its 16 regional offices will be responsible for
overall project coordination, with the following specific duties: (a) to appraise community subproject proposals for
compliance with project guidelines and eligibility criteria found in the Project Operational Manual; (b) to assess
community participation in identifying, preparing and executing subprojects and quality of technical assistance; (c)
to supervise the Municipal Councils to ensure they are adequately managing quality of subproject implementation
and providing sufficient training support to communities; (d) to implement public information campaigns to
disseminate information about the project; (e) to implement introductory training and technical assistance programs
for all municipal councils and community associations with approved subprojects (to include training on subproject
implementation, contracting, operation and maintenance and financial management); (f) to monitor and apply
performance incentives to reward efficiency, transparency and inclusiveness of community associations and
municipal councils, and also to penalize poor performance/misappropriation (e.g., legal action for find
misallocation)5; (g) to monitor project performance through the Management Information System (MIS) and to
periodically report progress related to the project performance indicators; (h) to prepare annual implementation and
physical performance reviews; and (i) to submit project Annual Operating Plans to the Bank for approval. Using
standardized cost indicators, reasonable costing for subproject implementation would be ensured. Departures from
standard designs would have to be fully justified in the subproject proposal, as would proposed investments which
fall outside the range of standardized costs.
Project Oversight: The Secretariat of Planning, Science and Technology (SEPLANTEC) will undertake project
oversight, delegating project coordination to CAR, who will receive and approve the Annual Operating Plans for the
project Municipal Councils (and will receive and approve community subproject proposals in the case of PAC).
CAR will be responsible for day-to-day project oversight with respect to monitoring, supervision of municipal
councils, evaluation and required reporting under the project.
Monitoring and evaluation arrangements: Analysis of implementation will depend on a database of subproject
information from the project Management Information System (MIS) operated and maintained by the STU. The
MIS used under RPAP has been improved under the new project. The database is currently organized in three
general levels: (a) a subproject information module, which contains pertinent physical and financial information for
each subproject; (b) a financial management module, from which Statements of Expenditure (SOEs) are generated;
and (c) a project management module, from which all project reports are generated. Under the new project these
three modules will be integrated to allow improved monitoring of the entire subproject cycle. The database will
also be expanded to include community profiles, and quantitative variables relating to control groups, with the aim
of improving the capacity to evaluate project impact. Finally, the MIS will be migrated on-line to allow real time
data entry and monitoring directly from the field and regional offices. The STU will continue to be responsible for
maintaining and regularly updating the MIS, including key Project information (as agreed with the Bank). Through
periodic processing of the database information, combined with field visits and inputs from project supervision
reports, project contracted studies and audits, the STU would monitor project characteristics and trends, identify
implementation problems and accomplishments and undertake or promote appropriate actions to improve project
implementation. The Bank's Recife Office would also monitor project performance indicators through the online
MIS, and with inputs from the State, review monthly disbursement summaries and supervise subproject
implementation progress on a sample basis in the field.
Accounting, financial reporting and auditing arrangements: : The Special Account will be established in a
commercial bank, and the project accounts will be maintained and audited annually in accordance with the audit
TORs. According to arrangements for Bank-financed projects in Brazil, the annual financial audit of the project
accounts for the period January I to December 31 of the year will be carried out by independent auditors acceptable
to the Bank. The audit report will be submitted to the Bank no later than June 30i in the year following the year for
which the projects accounts are audited. The Auditor's TOR will include the issuance of a management letter on

accuracy, the relevance of supporting documents, eligibility for financing in terms of the project's legal agreements
and standards of record keeping and internal controls related to the foregoing. With respect to withdrawals on the
basis of SOEs, such audits would contain a separate opinion as to whether the SOEs, together with the procedures
involved in their preparation, support the related withdrawals.
Project Reporting: Periodic processing of the database information will permit the monitoring of the characteristics
and evolution of project implementation. The STU will be responsible for reporting on the project performance
indicators.
* Annual Physical Performance Reviews: The Annual physical performance review would be conducted on a
sample of community subproject beneficiary communities. Variables assessed during the Review would include:
quality of investments, as assessed by beneficiaries and qualified professionals, cost-effectiveness, as compared
with similar public sector investments, and procurement, such as local contracting of goods and services.
* Implementation Review: The Implementation Review would be held annually, together with the Physical
performance review. The Review would take place in advance of the approval of next year's Annual Operating
Plan. The range of studies to be prepared for each of these reviews would be agreed upon on a rolling basis, at
appraisal for the first review, and at each annual implementation review for the subsequent implementation
review.

Rural Poverty Reduction Project - Bahia
Economic Analysis
Specific investments carried out under the new project will be decided by communities over the life span of the
project. It is thus not possible to know a priori how available resources will be precisely allocated, and therefore a
precise ex ante estimation of their cost-effectiveness, economic rate of return and fiscal impact is not possible.
However, subprojects to be financed under the proposed project would, in general, be similar to those financed
under previous and ongoing community-based rural development projects. Based on accumulated experience from
the R-NRDP and RPAP, the following aspects of project investments were assessed: (i) cost-effectiveness and
sustainability of infrastructure and social subprojects; (ii) financial viability of productive subprojects; and (iii) the
fiscal impact of the RPRP.
Cost Effectiveness and Sustainability of Infrastructure and Social Subprojects
The bulk of subproject investments under the RPAP were of the infrastructure type (77%), while social subprojects
comprised less than 3%. Most of these subprojects are in the realm of core public services (water, sanitation,
electrification, social investments). Numerous studies show that these basic services provide benefits that justify
their universal provision.' The R-NRDPs and RPAPs demonstrated that the CDD approach to rural infrastructure
and service delivery targeted to the poorest can work, in a cost effective manner. Several aspects of project design
help to ensure that infrastructure and social subprojects undertaken represent the least-cost, best alternative. First,
the demand-driven nature of each subproject permits scarce resources to flow where they are most needed.
Community participation, under the direction of the project Municipal Councils, ensures that the chosen subproject
is the best alternative for the local community. Furthermore, the project has, in the Municipal Councils, a democratic
mechanism to prioritize the use of the available resources. Second, the use of standard technical designs (projetos
padrdo) for the most common types of infrastructure and social subprojects (including corresponding cost
parameters) ensures that community associations employ least-cost models for subproject implementation. These
standard designs also decrease search and information costs for community associations by providing established
patterns of initiating and completing a subproject. Experience under the RPAP demonstrates that the technical
quality of these investments has been good. Third, the delegation of subproject implementation directly to the
community associations has proven to generate cost savings, when compared to comparable quality works
implemented by public sector agencies. The contracting procedures prescribed in the Project Operational Manual
require direct contracting through competitive processes on all subprojects: the community association solicits three
bids for the subproject and chooses the least-cost bid.  These characteristics have contributed to the cost-
effectiveness of the subprojects financed under the project. Based on the analysis of a random sample of subprojects
(including ten categories which collectively represent some 80% of the types of subprojects being financed), it has
been found that, for infrastructure and social subprojects, costs under the RPAP were found to be 30-50% cheaper
than projects of similar quality, when financed by the state. State-level evaluation of the RPAP in Bahia, Ceara,
Pernambuco, Piaui, Rio Grande do Norte and Sergipe examined the quality of the materials used, the quality of
overall finish, and the quality of operation of the investments. In all states surveyed, the majority of subprojects
were found to be technically satisfactory and of good quality. Beneficiaries expressed their satisfaction with the
quality of their subprojects and regarded more than 90% of all investments as being satisfactory overall.
Also, according to experience, the operation and maintenance of infrastructure and social subprojects has been good,
with community associations charging user fees sufficient to operate and maintain the investments. The overall
evaluation study of the Northeast RPAP program, carried out in 2000, reviewed a sample of 8,123 subprojects
funded by the R-NRDP in 1995 and RPAPs in 1997/98, finding that 7,240 of them, or 890/o, were fully operational
in March 2000. Furthermore, the same study found that there was no substantial difference in terms of sustainability
across infrastructure, productive and social subprojects. Of 6,064 infrastructure, 1,820 productive and 239 social

BR. December 1998.

community subprojects, 89.2%, 86.8% and 88.3%, respectively, were fully operational at the time of the study. The
Bank preparation mission that visited the State of Alagoas in April 2001 confirmed this finding. Field visits in
Alagoas were instructive because the reformulated NRDP, which ended in 1996, was not followed by an RPAP as
happened in other Northeastern states. The mission was therefore able to examine the current situation of old
investments, five or more years later - an ad hoc survey of the "after project" situation. What the mission observed
in the eight municipalities surveyed was encouraging: all the old infrastructure and social subprojects visited were
working well, properly looked after by the community, and obviously satisfying each community's felt needs.
Financial Viability of Productive Subprojects
Benefit-cost ratios are high (greater than 2.0) for all productive subprojects analyzed (Table A). Analysis of selected
productive subprojects also suggests that the investments are generally financially sustainable (Table B). Although
beneficiary associations have received a one-time investment grant from the RPAP, this investment is financially
sustainable because cost recovery through user fees by the average beneficiary association is, in general, adequate to
cover both O&M and replacement of the original investment long before the end of its useful economic life.
For illustrative purposes, twelve productive subprojects representing some of the most typical productive
investments carried out under the RPAPs, were selected for financial analysis. Activity models were constructed for
these subprojects, based on field interviews with the managers of the subprojects (carried out during evaluation),
supervision and project preparation missions, and consultation of standard project designs (projetos padrdo)
prepared by the STUs.2 The subprojects analyzed are as follows:
*   Manioc Mill. Middle-size construction equipped with mill, press, oven and other equipment required to
process cassava into flour. Investments include a pack animal to transport produce to and from the plant.
T'he mill serves a local community of some 30 to 40 farming families. The plant operates around 100 days
per year processing some 120 tons of cassava into approximately 30 tons offarinha and 4.8 tons of starch
employing one person to operate the plant during those days. Farmers are charged a users' fee of 15% of
output. Association members normally pay a smaller fee than non-members.
*   Communal Tractor. Tractor of 75 HP, plus trailer, grain sheller, grader and other equipment, including a
garage. The tractor benefits an association of some 65 farming families. The tractor works for members and
non-members providing land preparation, grain shelling and transport services. It works approximately
1,700 hour per year serving some 300 ha. User fees for members are smaller than prices charged by private
tractor owners and fees charged to non-members. The subproject employs a full-time motorist hired by the
association.
*    Small Irrigation 1. Purchase of 18 localized irrigation kits for 38 families to pump and irrigate a total of
some 29 ha (0.8 ha per family). The irrigation is accompanied by the introduction of a new technical
package and two new cash crops, chuchu and quiabo (two high-price Brazilian vegetables with good local
markets), which replace the existing traditional cultivation of corn, beans and bananas, providing a very
good return.
*   Small Irrigation 2. Sprinkling irrigation system to irrigate 10 ha of previously uncultivated land with water
pumped from a permanent water source, benefiting 10 farming families. Most of the irrigated land is used
for traditional subsistence crops, corn and beans, although a cash crop-- watermelon - is planted on one-
third of the new area. Two crops are obtained per year.
*   Goat Production. Production of goats for a group of some 30 farmers, consisting of 120 breeding females
and 4 breeding males. A pen, a fence and other facilities are constructed and 85 ha of improved pastures are
installed. Income is derived from the sale (or self-consumption) of incremental animals and the sale (or
self-consumption) of milk.
2 Technical units of RPAP projects prepare projetos padrdo to be given to potentially interested communities and technical consultants to serve
as a guide for project design. The objective is to reduce subproject preparation costs and improve their design.

*  Animal Feed Production Eguipment. Grinding machine and complementary equipment to produce animal
feed from crop residuals, together with a small construction to shelter the machine. Farmers pay a small
amount (R$ 1.5) per hour to use the machine. From these payments, electricity and maintenance costs are
covered and a small fund is formed. The machine works approximately six months per year. Raw materials
and labor to operate the machine are supplied by users. The organization and supervision of machine use is
freely supplied by association leaders.
*  Honey Production. Purchase of 340 beehives plus 2 decanters, 2 centrifuges and other apiculture and honey
processing equipment to benefit an association of some 23 members with no previous apiculture
experience. Training is provided along with the equipment. The beehives, located in 8 sites, are maintained
by association members. They yield an annual output of some 8,200 kg of honey which is sold wholesale.
* Local Bakery. Middle-size construction (120 sq. m) equipped with a gas oven and other baking facilities to
produce various types of bread, with an average output of 130 kg of bread per day. Employs a master baker
and two full-time workers. Bread is sold locally in the surrounding communities.
*  Fish Farm. Five fish ponds of 2,200 m2 each, with a capacity for 8,500 tilapia fish each. Ponds are rotated,
with 4 ponds being permanently used at a time. Two harvests are collected per pond in a year, with a total
output of 24,000 kg. of fish. Output is sold locally to middle-men. One person is employed half-time to
feed the fish and another is employed half-time as watchman. Part-time labor is used to harvest the fish.
* Cashew Processing Plant. Middle size plant plus equipment to process cashew nuts. Some 200 tons of
cashew nuts are processed annually into 46 tons of roasted and packed cashew nuts, which are then sold
wholesale. It operates during ten months of the year, employing around 6 operators. Cashew nuts are
bought from surrounding farmers serving some 150 farmers with I to 5 ha of cashew trees each.
*  Jam Production Plant. Plant to process various local fruits into different types of jams and other
confectionery products, producing an average of 175 kg per day of these products. Fruit and other inputs
are bought by the plant. Products are sold retail locally and also wholesale to retailers. Employs a plant
manager and three permanent workers.
*  Small Dairy Plant. Middle size plant (155 sq. m) equipped with a pasteurization kit, cooling chamber and
other facilities to pasteurize milk, with a capacity of 1,200 1. per day. The plant is supplied by around 400
cows with an average daily output of 3 1. per cow belonging to some 60 dairy farmers in a radius of 6 km.
Employs a plant manager and 4 permanent workers. The results of the financial analysis are summarized in

The investment cost of the subprojects ranges from around R$7,000 to R$65,000, which is typical for RPAP
productive investments. All subprojects show satisfactory internal rates of return, some of them being very high.
Less than six years are needed to recover the investment in all cases and less than 3.5 in half of the cases. The net
incremental annual income or value-added generated by the subprojects (at full development) ranges from R$1,149
for the feed preparation equipment to R$90,781 in the case of one of the irrigation subprojects, with an average
value of around R$28,000 for an average investment of around R$ 39,000.3 The IRRs of the subprojects compare
favorably with the real cost of borrowing to the Brazilian Government, which is on the order of 11 to 12 per cent.
The [RRs also compare favorably with the interest rates that would have to be paid in concessionary rural credit
programs, like those of the Banco do Nordeste and Banco do Brasil. Only two subprojects --the cashew processing
plant and one of the irrigation subprojects -- would be able to pay the high interest rates charged by commercial
banks for term lending.
Three categories of projects can be identified in the above illustrative sample. First among these are communal
processing equipment or livestock activities which are simple to operate and well-known to farmers, that meet
community-wide needs, directly benefiting a majority of families in the community. The manioc mill, communal
tractor, feed production equipment and goat production subprojects fall into this category. The results summarized
in Table A illustrate that these types of investments can be profitable. Their financial returns, however, are not high
because (a) benefits are passed on to farmers in the form of moderate user fees or (b) because the activity in question
is intrinsically not very profitable as in the case of small-scale goat rearing. Economic returns are higher than those

shown in Table A above for the same reasons mentioned in (a). These subprojects have the advantage of building on
activities familiar to farmers, and have therefore little training requirements and simple management needs. They
also have low marketing requirements since the community itself is the market for the service and the outputs
produced with the help of the service normally have regular marketing channels or are self-consumed.
The second category of subprojects are those promoting off- or on-farm productive activities which generate full
time employment and considerable income for a particular group of farmers in the community. The small irrigation
subprojects and the honey production, jam production, fish farm and bakery subprojects belong in this category.
New activities producing a final consumption good to be sold in markets outside the community, exemplified by the
honey production, fish farming and jam production subprojects, can be profitable and offer a source of income and
employment to some members of the community; however, these subprojects tend to be demanding in terms of
marketing and managerial skills.5 These subprojects are normally part of industries where the entry cost is low and
competition high, leaving small operating margins. The availability of working capital and the ability to establish a
brand name to differentiate the product and place it in the best-paying markets are two common constraints.
Local bakeries, which are popular subprojects in some states, have little training and marketing requirements, and
are similar to cassava mills or communal tractors to the extent that they cater for a local need and have therefore a
local market, although in this case it is that of a final good rather than of a productive service, but they only offer
employment and income to a reduced number of community members. The irrigation subprojects illustrate well
that, whenever possible, irrigation together with the introduction of cash crops and an improved technical package is
a profitable and cost-effective way of increasing income and employment in the semi-arid areas of the Brazilian
Northeast, which can be successfully operated by local farmers at a very small scale. The contrast between the very
high returns to investment of the first subproject, where new cash crops and technology were introduced alongside
with irrigation, and the moderately high one of the second subproject highlights the impact of profiting from the
availability of irrigation water to introduce wider changes in the cropping system.
The last category of subprojects consists of processing plants requiring comparatively higher capital investment,
which operate on a scale bigger than the communal equipment included in the first category, benefiting farmers
outside the local community and hence with impact at a more regional level. The dairy and cashew processing plants
exemplify this type of subprojects.
To examine the financial robustness of the subprojects, a sensitivity analysis was carried out of the illustrative
activity models. Three scenarios are considered. In the first one, production is assumed to be 20% below the base
case, because of, say, marketing problems.  A 20% decrease in output causes a 20% decrease in revenue, but this
is, to some extent, matched by a reduction in the use of inputs and hence in variable costs. In the second scenario,
the price decreases 20% and, because of marketing problems, revenue also decreases by the same proportion without
any compensating element.  Finally, in the third scenario, an increase of 20% in the price of variable costs is
assumed. The results of the sensitivity analysis are shown in Table B.
' Other popular subprojects in this category are clothes-making and the production of different artisanal goods such as embroideries.

Some subprojects are more sensitive than others to changing market conditions. In general, subprojects which are
highly dependent on purchased inputs, like the communal tractor, the bakery, the fish farm, the jam production
plant and the dairy plant, are more sensitive to deteriorating market conditions than those little dependent on
purchased inputs, such as the manioc mill, goat production, feed preparation equipment and honey production
subprojects. In all cases, the worst scenario is that of a decrease in prices (scenario 2). The second worst scenario
depends on the type of subproject; for subprojects highly dependent on purchased inputs, it is the increase in
variable production costs (scenario 3), while for those little dependent on purchased inputs, it is the fall in output
(scenario 1).
To complete the financial analysis of productive subprojects, a weighted average of the IRRs is calculated of the
activity models included in the sample. The shares of each of the twelve types of illustrative models (which were



Page 57
taken to represent other similar ones) in the total amount invested in community subprojects in the RPAP program
until the end of April 2001 were used as weights.6 The resulting average IRR is 30.2%. This figure gives an
indication of the overall profitability of the productive subprojects normally financed under the RPAP, but should
not be taken as an ex ante estimate of the aggregate profitability of the productive investments of the RPRP, since it
is not known a priori which type of subprojects will be most requested by beneficiary communities during the new
project.
Fiscal Impact
There are two possible assumptions for estimating the fiscal impact of the RPRP program on the budget of the State
Governments of the Northeast Region. One assumption is that, in the absence of the program, State Governments
would not carry out the type of investments financed by RPRP, devoting those resources to other uses. An
alternative assumption is that without RPRP, State Governments would carry out the investments using a different
targeting and disbursement mechanism. The latter is the most plausible assumption, particularly for the
infrastructure and social investments, in view of their absolute priority, the social and political pressure from the
rural population and municipal authorities in favor of these investments, and the sustained interest shown by
Northeast Governments in the RPAP program. The focus here is therefore on this second hypothesis. It is worth
noting, however, that if the investments were not carried out, the resources saved by the State Governments would
not significantly alter their overall fiscal position. As shown in Table C, where the annual program cost of the RPRP
is compared with total and current state budgetary expenses, the annual cost of the RPRP to the Northeast
Govermnents ranges between 0.4 and 1.0 per cent of their total annual budgetary expenditures and between 0.5 and
1.2 per cent of their total states' annual current expenditures for year 2000.

7RPRP cost figures for Paraiba and Maranhao are provisional. The State Government part is 25% of the total cost minus the resources
contributed by the beneficiary communities, which are a 10% of the "Community Subprojects" Component (90% of the total cost). USS figures
have been converted into R$ using a 2.1 exchange rate. State budget figures are for year 2000.



Page 58
Under the second assumption, the direct impact of RPRP on government earnings derives both from the generation
of incremental government revenue and from savings in government costs.
There are tangible government savings associated with the community driven design of the program. Thus, as
mentioned above, evaluations have shown that the cost of investments implemented by communities (either directly
or contracted) were 30-50 per cent lower than prices paid by public authorities for similar works. There are also
budgetary savings associated to the decreased need for state and local governments to provide some inescapable
services which need is reduced by RPAP investments. This is for instance the case with government costs for water
distribution using carros pipa to communities without drinking water in critical periods. Thus, a mid-term
evaluation review of Bahia, Ceara and Sergipe concluded that in Sergipe it is estimated that savings expenses for
carros pipa associated with RPAP investments totaled R$ 430,000 (about R$ 100,000 per month) during a year of
'normal' rainfall; in Ceara savings were estimated at R$ 950,000; and in Bahia, R$1 million. In years of severe
drought, as in 1998, savings were at least twice those estimated for a normal year. Provision of better quality, more
reliable water also has less quantifiable but nonetheless significant impacts on health, reducing public health costs of
Municipal Governments. Subproject operation and maintenance costs are also typically paid by the beneficiary
community, reducing the fiscal burden of municipalities and states (with a few exceptions, e.g. electricity and some
types of water supply, commonly maintained by state agencies and operated in return for a user fee).
With respect to revenue generation direct impacts are likely to be small but indirect impacts could be significant
The incremental revenue on the sales tax (ICMS) will be small because much of the incremental production of the
subprojects is either self-consumed or not liable to taxation or circulates in informal markets where tax is rarely
paid. Infrastructure subprojects, however, can have big one-time indirect benefits. Experience for instance shows
that there was a large increase in the purchase and use of domestic appliances when electricity became available.
Thus, the same mid-term evaluation report quoted above estimated the incremental ICMS revenue from the most
common appliances (TV sets, refrigerators, stereos, irons, antennas, etc.) at approximately R$2.0 million in Sergipe,
R$2.2 million in Ceara and R$1.0 million in Bahia. Incremental ICMS revenue from electrical equipment is also
associated to the purchase of items such as agricultural machinery and irrigation pumps.
Aggregate Impact of the RPRP Program on Employment, Income and Cultivated Area
The July 2000 impact evaluation study carried out of the RPAPs in eight Northeastern States, the results of which
are examined in Annex 2, provides an estimate of the aggregate impact on employment, income and cultivated area
of the infrastructure, productive and social subprojects included in the program. The study, based on a sample from
the most representative types of subprojects in each of the States, with an error of less than 20%, allows the
calculation of summary figures of incremental jobs created, incremental income generated and incremental number
of ha cultivated per unit invested in productive subprojects. From these summary figures, a gross approximation to
the aggregate benefits of the entire RPRP program has been estimated, with the following results (rounded figures):
Total investment in community subprojects:                           US$362.0 million
Incremental employment created:                                           40,000 jobs
Incremental net annual income/savings generated:                      US$80.0 million
Incremental cropped area:                                             40,000 hectares
When the impact of the predecessor R-NRDP is included, aggregate investments in community subprojects of about
US$800 million, through March 2000, have generated almost 100,000 additional jobs, incremental net annual
income/savings of US$203 million and 85,000 hectares of incremental cultivated area. These estimates are subject
to a number of caveats, among which is the fact that the level of significance of the sample is not big and that the
representative subproject mix under the RPAP only by chance would be replicated under the RPRP. Furthermore,
the estimates reflect not only the direct impact of the investments on employment, income and cultivated land but
also some indirect impacts, for example, the expansion of cultivated area, employment and income derived from the
introduction of a tractor or a casa defarinha in a certain community. The above figures should be taken therefore as
an indication of the order of magnitude of the benefits involved.

Rural Poverty Reduction Project - Bahia
Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements
A) GENERAL
All procurement of goods under the Project would be carried out in accordance with the "Guidelines,
Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" dated January 1995 and revised in January and August
1996, September 1997, and January 1999. Consultants would be employed in accordance with the Guidelines,
Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers, dated January 1997 and revised in
September 1997 and January 1999, and the provisions stipulated in the Loan Agreement. The methods to be
used for procurement are described below and the estimated amounts for each method, are summarized in Table
A. The threshold contract values for the use of each method are established in Table B.
B) PROCUREMENT RESPONSIBILITIES AND CAPACITY
Project administration and monitoring will be the responsibility of the State Secretariat for Planning, Science
and Technology's Technical Unit (CAR). A procurement capacity assessment of the STU was conducted by
the Project Team's Procurement Specialist and was cleared by the Regional Procurement Advisor's Office
(RPA) on January 26, 2001. The "Overall Procurement Risk" was assessed as "LOW". The STU has
successfully carried out four previous Bank operations and its procurement performance has been consistently
satisfactory. In addition, periodic audits of subprojects covering procurement and financial aspects and
including selected physical inspections of goods and works procured revealed appropriate oversight and quality
control by the STU. The STU has appropriate procedures, intemal controls, technical and administrative
support, and is well organized and staffed. Procurement responsibilities will be carried out by the STU's
Procurement Officer and his support staff who have performed successfully similar functions during the
previous loan and are well versed in Bank procurement policies and procedures. The bulk of procurement
financed by the Project would be carried out by the grants beneficiaries. The implementing agency would carry
out procurement of consulting services to provide technical assistance to the beneficiaries, and exceptionally
procure goods and works on behalf of the beneficiaries which are deemed not to have sufficient capacity.
However, it is estimated that the amount of procurement carried out by the implementing agency will be
limited. The beneficiaries' administrative capacity would be demonstrated in the subproject proposals and
evaluated by the Implementing Agency. In addition, the Implementing Agency would exercise overall quality
control of procurement financed by the subprojects.
C) PROCUREMENT ARRANGEMENTS
Subprojects
The Project will provide matching grants to legally constituted rural community associations to finance small
scale subprojects, finance technical assistance and training for institutional strengthening. Grants would be
made in accordance with the selection procedures described in the Project Operational Manual. A standard
grant agreements acceptable to the Bank would be used to transfer grant funds to the beneficiaries under
conditions that would ensure adequate implementation.
Procurement of goods and works under subprojects costing less than US$50,000 implemented in remote areas
would be carried out mainly through direct contracting and community participation. This procurement method
is appropriate because most subprojects: (a) would be small and/or implemented in scattered or remote areas
and therefore it will be difficult to obtain competitive proposals; (b) can be managed directly by rural
communities, who will also contribute directly to the work through the donation of unskilled labor and local
materials; (c) will be selected on the basis of willingness of the beneficiary communities to contribute to and
physically supervise works execution; and (d) would provide a vehicle for communities to play an active role in



Page 63
the local development process. Additional procurement of goods estimated to cost less than US$100,000
equivalent, up to an aggregate amount of US$2.7 million, would follow commercial practices which would
include price comparison from three qualified suppliers. All such goods would be procured at a reasonable
price, taking into account also other relevant factors such as time of delivery and efficiency and reliability of the
goods and availability of maintenance facilities and spare parts, and would be used exclusively in implementing
the grants. Contracts estimated to cost more than US$100,000 equivalent would be awarded on the basis of
National Competitive Bidding (NCB) procedures acceptable to the Bank.
Works contracts (other than contracts costing less than US$50,000 in scattered or remote areas) estimated to
cost less than US$100,000 equivalent, up to an aggregate amount of US$2.0 million, would be procured under
lump-sum, fixed price contracts awarded on the basis of quotations obtained from a minimum of three qualified
local contractors in response to a written invitation. The invitation shall include a detailed description of the
works, including basic specifications, the required completion date, a basic form of agreement acceptable to the
Bank, and relevant drawings, where applicable. The award would be made to the contractor who offers the
lowest price quotation for the required work, and who has the experience and resources to complete the contract
successfully.
The standard bidding documents for NCB agreed between the Bank and the Federal Government of Brazil
would be used. No International Competitive Bidding (ICB) is anticipated for any goods or works under the
Project.
Consultant Services
Firms
The loan would finance contracts with consulting firms for information campaigns, technical assistance, studies
and capacity building for the beneficiary communities and the STU. These contracts would be awarded
following a Quality and Cost Based Selection (QCBS) process, in accordance with Section II of the Consultant
Guidelines. However, services estimated to cost less than US$200,000 equivalent per contract may be procured
following Least Cost Selection procedures in accordance with provisions for paragraphs 3.1 and 3.6 of the
Consultant Guidelines. In addition, services estimated to cost less than US$100,000 equivalent per contract,
may, with the Bank's prior agreement, be procured on the basis of Single Source Selection procedures in
accordance with paragraphs 3.8 and 3.11 of the Consultant Guidelines.
Individuals
The consulting services required for the Project include specialized advisory services and services to support
project monitoring, such as MIS experts, which are appropriate for individual consultants.
Individual consultants would be selected by comparison of qualifications of three candidates and retained in
accordance with the provisions of Paragraph 5.1 through 5.3 of the Consultant Guidelines. The competitive
process followed to select individual consultants would be described in further detail in the Operational Manual.
Operating Costs and Salaries
Sundry items, utilities and other incremental recurring costs would be financed on a 20 percent basis and would
be procured using the STUs administrative procedures which were reviewed and found acceptable to the Bank.
In addition, the Bank would finance 50 percent of STU incremental staff costs for project supervision and
monitoring.
Prior review thresholds and Procurement Supervision
The proposed thresholds for prior review are summarized in Table B. Prior review would be required for all
NCB contracts. In addition, the Bank would review the first contracts procured through shopping procedures
for goods and works, respectively. Contracts with consulting firms estimated to cost US$100,000 or more and



Page 64
with individual consultants estimated to cost US$50,000 or more would be subject to the Bank's prior review.
Assignments of a critical nature and amendments raising contract values above the said thresholds would also
be subject to prior review.
Although the level of Bank prior review of procurement would be overall low, it would be compensated in
several ways. First, reviews of procurement by community contracting would be carried out yearly during
project implementation, under terms of reference agreed during project preparation. Second, cost comparisons
of similar subprojects would be conducted using the project MIS in order to detect possible procurement
problems and determine whether prices paid under community procurement were reasonable. Third, the
project's annual physical performance evaluation would verify the physical implementation of subprojects and
analyze procurement issues. Finally, during Bank supervision, additional random reviews would be conducted
of subprojects, including field visits and review of subproject documentation.

Disbursement
Financial Management, Auditing and Disbursement Arrangements
The financial management systems of CAR were reviewed by a Bank Financial Management Specialist during
project preparation for compliance with OP/BP 10.02 and the Loan Administration Change Initiative (LACI)
Implementation Handbook. Based on this review, the project was certified as category "A", indicating that the
Project satisfies the Bank's financial management requirements but some of the existing financial management
reports have to modified. Disbursements for all expenditures would be made on the basis of statements of
expenditure (SOEs), except for goods and works exceeding US$100,000 equivalent; contracts with consulting firms
above US$100,000 equivalent; and with individuals above US$50,000. The information required for the compilation
of SOEs would be maintained by the project Technical Unit in the MIS data base. All SOEs would be transmitted
from the project Technical Unit to the World Bank in Washington. This procedure would allow the Bank and the
project Technical Unit to maintain a cumulative account of the progress of project implementation.
The communities' contributions to subproject investments would be defined in the agreement (convenio) between
the project Technical Unit and the beneficiary community association. This contribution would be computed as part
of counterpart finance of the project. Simple, standard records, whose format would be included in the project
Operational Manual, would be completed by a designated community representative. They would be used to record
cash contributions, materials and labor inputs, and would be subject to project audit procedures.
The proposed Bank loan would be disbursed over a period of four years. The project is expected to be completed by
the project's Closing Date of June 30, 2005. The allocation of loan proceeds by disbursement category is shown in
Table C.
An action plan was prepared and agreed for the project to strengthen the current system, and will be implemented
within six months of loan effectiveness (Financial, Accounting and Monitoring Indicators). The annual financial
audit will include a separate opinion on the eligibility of expenditures disbursed on the basis of SOEs or Project
Management Reports (PMRs) (if funds are disbursed on the basis of PMRs).
Special Account. In order to facilitate project implementation, the Borrower will establish a special account in US
Dollars with Bank of Brazil , with an authorized allocation based on projected disbursements for four months, so as
to initiate disbursements under the traditional disbursement methodology. The project Technical Unit will approve
funds for transfer directly to the beneficiary communities, via the financial agent chosen by the community
association.
PMRs-Based Disbursement. Once the Bank approves the Borrower's financial report system for PMR-based
disbursements, and once the borrower is prepared to adopt the PMR-based disbursement option, such disbursements
should follow the following procedures:
•  All withdrawals from the Loan Account shall be deposited by the Bank into a special Account based upon Table
C. Each such deposit into the Special Account will be withdrawn by the Bank from the loan account under one
or more of the eligible categories.
*  Each application for withdrawal from the Loan Account for deposit into the Special Account must be supported
by a Project Management Report.
*  Upon receipt of each application for withdrawal the Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from the
Loan Account and deposit into the Special Account an amount equal to the lesser of: (a) the amount so
requested; and (b) the amount which the Bank has determined, based on the Project Management Report
accompanying that application, is required to be deposited in order to finance eligible expenditures during six-
month period following the date of the Financial Management Report; and (c) the amount deposited, when
added to the amount indicated by the Project Management Report to be remaining in the Special Account,
cannot exceed the amount of US$10,800,000.



Page 66
* In the case of a faster than expected draw-down of the special account, an interim PMR may be submitted to
request a supplemental disbursement prior to the next scheduled quarterly disbursement request. All supporting
documentation authenticating the expenditures reported in the PMRs will be maintained by the Project
Technical Unit and made available for review by auditors and Bank missions as requested.
Auditing Arrangements. According to arrangements for Bank-financed projects in Brazil, the special account will
be audited in conjunction with the annual financial audit of the project accounts for the period January I to
December 31. This audit will be performed by an Independent Auditor. Both the terms of reference for the Audit,
and the Auditor shall be acceptable to the Bank. The audit report will be submitted to the Bank no later than June 30
in the year following the year for which the project accounts are audited. The Auditor's TOR will include the
