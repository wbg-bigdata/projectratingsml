INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED CREDIT TO
THE PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF YEMEN
FOR A FISHERIES PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen (PDRY)
for the equivalent of US$3.5 million on standard IDA terms to help finance
a project for fisheries development.
PART I: THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "The Economy of Southern Yemen" (R70-201)
dated October 2, 1970, was distributed to the Executive Directors on
October 23, 1970.  An economic mission visited PDRY in November 1972, and is
now preparing its report. A Country Data sheet is attached as Annex I.
3.        The economy of PDRY prior to independence in 1967 was centered
on Aden and was service-oriented, with entrepot trade, bunkering for
Suez Canal traffic and services rendered for the British military base
providing the mainstay of economic activity. The productive sectors generat-
ed less than one-quarter of GDP. Except for the large Aden refinery, there
was little industrial activity and a considerable amount of foodstuffs and
manufactured goods were imported. The large trade deficit was covered partly
by remittances of Yemenis living abroad, but mainly by British budgetary
aid and military expenditures.
4.        The closure of the Suez Canal, withdrawal of British troops from
Aden and the discontinuation of British budget suppQrt in 1967/68 led to a
major setback in the economy, with GNP falling by one-third. Unemployment
became a serious problem especially in Aden where employment dropped by
nearly one-half. The post-independence governments followed conservative
budgetary policies and increased revenue by new taxes including the intro-
duction in 1970 of import duties. Domestic revenue increased from nearly
US$22 million in FY1968/69 to about US$39 million in FY1971/72. Severe
measures were also taken to reduce expenditures which dropped by approx-
imately one-third in 1968/69, partly due to heavy salary cuts. In recent
years, however, the need for an expansion of education, health, social
services, and government administration, particularly in rural areas, result-
ed in a rise in total expenditure which absorbed most of the rise in revenue.
Nevertheless, the government has been successful in keeping the budgetary
deficit at the same level for the past three years. The deficit was largely
financed by borrowing from the banking system, and partly by liquidating
government foreign assets.



-2-
7.The balance of payments has been under pressure since 1967, Twith
loss of exchange reserves in 1968, 1969 and 1970, offset in 1970 by receipt
of S3ER's. On the receipts side, the loss of British grants for budgetary
support was largely offset by an increase in private transfers by Yemenis
working abroad, while traditional non-petroleum exports and earnings frcm
entrepot trade increased somewhat through 1970. Receipts from the last
three items fell in 1971, but there was also a decline in factor payments
abroad. At the same time, import controls were tightened, and 1971 closed
with a small gain of reserves. exceeding the receipt of JDR's. Foreign ex-
change holdings (excluding SDR's) remained steady in the first six months of
1972.
6.        To lessen the countryis dependence on the service sectors, the
jovernment is making an effort to diversify the econoanv. in view of the
scarcity of known natural. resources, this process will be slow and difficult.
Agriculture, including the fisheries sub-sector, is one of the few areas off-
ering development opportunities.   There is also scope for some small-scale
industrial activity which would broaden the productive sector of PDRYts
economy and reduce unemployment in urban areas.
7.        The Three-Year Development Plan (1'?71/72-1973/i,) consequently
seeks to expand agricultural production (inc'Luding fisheries) and to
establish light industries using local raw materials. The Plan also
envisages the construction of roads to connect the governorates to Aden and
to link towns likely to become cen-ters of production.  Implementation of
the first year of the Plan (1971/72) was slow.   Actual sperding for that
.ear amounted to only US$ 9 million compared with planned spending of
USS 29 million, i.e. 38 percent of the planned amount. The lag in
implementation was most.ly related to the slow pace of disbursement under
bilateral aid and the lack of skills for projIect execution.
8.        As domestic financial, as well as manageri-al and technical,
resources are extremely limited, most of the public invesztment is being
financed by foreign assistance.   In agriculture, the Kuwait Fund is
engaged in preparing a project to increase production, especially of cotton,
in the Abyan Delta. The People's Republic of China has commenced construction
of the Ar. Ayn-tukalla road.  The USSR has already financed minor irrigation
works in the Wadi Tubar. area, where an FAO technical assistance mission
expects to identify an agricultural project for financing after 1974.
Consultants engaged by the Kuwait Fund hope shortly to complete a socio-agro-
economic survey of PDRY. Aid for fisheries development is described in
Part III - The Sector. 0-il exploration is under way, in collaboration with
the Algerian Company, SOITATRACH, but as yet no exploitable discoveries have
been made.
9.        In total, loans committed and lines of credit exceeded YD 58 million
(approximately US$ 153 million) in September 1972. Of these, about
YD 20 million (nearly US$ 52 million) has been allocated to projects but



-3-
disbursement of only YD 9.4 million (US$ 25 million) was reported. Much of
this aid was on concessionary terms, and it is evident   that in view of the
extremely limited resources of the country, low per capita income, the
severe constraints on the government budget and the balance of payments,
Bank Group assistance to PDRY should be on IDA terms.
10.       The hostilities that prevailed for some time between PDRY and
the Yemen Arab Republic (YAR) have ceased and the two countries signed
an agreement on November 25, 1972 designed to pave the way towards their
unification. Joint committees to bring about the unification have been
set up and progress towards drawing up a mutually acceptable constitution
and economic policy agreements has been reported.
11.       The Nationalization Law 11o. 37 of 1969 provided for the nation-
alization of most foreign - owned enterprises (mainly banks, insurance com-
panies and port services but not the refinery). At the same time, it
prescribed compensation in the form of 20-year government bonds bearing
interest of 2 percent, stating that 25 percent of the net annual profits
of the enterprises were to be used for servicing these bonds. A British
firm of accountants of international reputation was appointed in early 1970
to audit the accounts of the principal parties involved. Their report was
submitted in September 1971. Settlements have recently been reached with
three banks on terms not known to IDA. Other claimants have not found the
conditions offered by the Government satisfactory, since considerable counter-
claims appear to be involved. The PDRY Government has on various occassions
stated its willingness to move towards a solution of the remaining outstanding
cases and IDA has been in regular correspondence with the Government on this issu
PART II: BANK GROUP OPERATIODNS
12.       The People's Democratic Republic of Yemen became a member of the
3ank in 1969 and of IDA in 1970. The Bank Group's role in PDRY was designed
to support the Government's long-range economic objectives of strengthening
and diversifying the commodity-producing sectors to help create a production
rather than a service-oriented economy. Initially, therefore, Bank Group's
efforts were directed towards project identification and preparation in the
key sectors of agriculture and transport and towards the development of
human and institutional infrastructure required for these purposes. The
present and proposed operations include projects that are to a high degree
complementary to one another and also essential for realizing the country's
development potential.
13.       Assistance began under the First Highways Project (Credit No. 240-YDR),
for the detailed engineering of roads for subsequent road construction and
to provide technical assistance for the reorganization of the Public Works
Department. This program was continued in the Second Highways (Engineering)
Project (Credit Nlo. S12-YDR), which provided the additional assistance needed
to complete preparation of a Third Highway (Construction) Project. The proposed
fisheries project would be the Bank Group's first operation in the agriculture
and fisheries sector. Another agricultural/rural development project is
planned for the Wadi Hadramat (which is the region to be opened up under



- L -
the Third Highways Project). A second fisheries project fol the remote eastern
part of PDRY, as well as much needed small water supply scheme for Mukalla, are
an the planning stage.  An education project, with special emphasis on vocational
education, is being prepared for IDA financing with the assistance of a UNESCO/
I:1RD/Coooerative Program mission that visited PDRY in October, 1972.
PART III: THE SECTOR
1a.         The fisheries sub-sector offers the best growth prospects among
the economic sectors of PDRY. The fish wealth along the 1,200 k-m long
coastline is PDRY's most valuable known natural resource. FAO experts under
an FAO/UNDP Fisheries Development Project have estimated that if fully exploited,
annual catches could reach over 360,000 tons without overfishing compared to
today's catch of about 116,000 tons. Presently, the fisheries sub-sector con-
tributes only about 3 percent of the GNP. Although efforts have been made to
increase the catch by demarcating fishing grounds and demonstrating to local
fishermen modern fishing methocds, the marketing problem dampens their enthusiasm
for intensifying operations.  Fish constitute a large part, of the diet along the
coastal areas, but PDRY's domestic market is limited and its expansion hampered
by seasonal fishing patterns, wide fluctuations in prices, inadequate roads to
link production centers to consumers and the lack of facilities to preserve
fish. On the export side, some marketing arrangements have been concluded.
Traditionally, the fish that are not consumed locally are sun-dried and made
into a low quality product which is exported to Sri Lanka and countries
in East Africa,yielding annual revenues of about US$2-5 million. Recently,
PDRY has stepped up export of fish products, but progress is limited due to the
lack of processing facilities such as ice-making, refri.geration, freezing
and cold storage and lack of experience in   internation_L -a.rketino.
The other major constraints to fisheries develLopment in Plf--. are lack of
built-up fisheries harbors and of insulated vehicles .o transport fish from
the scattered landing sites to markets and proceassi.ng centers0
1-..       An estimated 13,000 fishermen are engaged in traditional coastal
fishing. They are scattered in approximately 30 fishing villages, with 46
percent of this population concentrated in areas around Mukal1a and Shihr
(the Project Area) situated about 330 miles east of Aden. Traditional fishing
is conducted ln small canoes ca:led "huris" and in somewhat larger vessels
called "sambuks" ranging from 5-14 meters in length. The 14-meter sambuks
are operated with inboard motors and are best suited for coastal fishing in
PDRY. Several existing small boat yards in PDRY specialize in building inboard
sambuks and a pilot boat construction program is planned with Danish aid. These
sambuks are inexpensive, familiar to the fishermen, and their capacity capable
of upgrading by installing simp-Le devices like mechanical net/line haulers and
ice boxes.  Sardines account for 90,000 tons, or 70 percent of the total landings
and are used mainly as fertilizer and animal feed. The bal.ance consists of
15,000 tons of species such as tuna, queenfish, mackerel and lobsters, for all
of which there is an international demand, and '11,000 tons of cuttlefish
(an inkfish species).



16.       Since 1969, industrial fishing operations have been carried out
with foreign assistance. A Japanese firm (Nishiro Fishing Company) trawls for
cuttlefish for export to Japan paying an annual royalty of about US$ 2 million.
More recently,in joint venture with the USSR and Kuwait, trawlers have been
employed to catch deep-sea spiny and rock lobsters which provide exports
of approximately 300 tons of lobster tails. These trawlers operate from
Aden,which has limited cold storage, freezing and ice-making facilities;
but steps are being taken both in Aden and in some othei major fishing areas
to increase these facilities with bilateral aid. Fishmeal is another fish
related industry which has received Government attention and a small fishmeal
plant is under constructicn at Mukalla with Kuwait Fund assistance.
17.       The Government-owned Public Corporation for Fish Wealth (PCFW),
established in 1970, is the institution responsible for all fisheries
development in PDRY. Its current activities include (a) commercial fisheries,
(b) credit assistance to fisheries cooperatives and, (c) training and research.
PCFW has made considerable headway but suffers from a critical shortage of
skilled middle management personnel and limited international marketing
experience. It is managed by an able Director-General who is assisted by a
coordination committee and a Board of Administration which lays down long-range
policies. To meet expansion requirements, the organizational structure of
PCFW and its supporting accounting system need substantial improvements, and
PCFW has requested IDA to provide the services of management consultants.
18.       There are presently 10 fisheries' cooperatives to which 25 percent
of the fishing population belong. The cooperatives perform certain market-
ing functions and receive loans in kind from PCFW, which also distributes
bilateral grants (mainly fishing gear) to them. They own boats and fishing
gear which are operated by the members on a profit-sharing basis. The
cooperatives are eligible to receive loans from the National Bank of Yemen
which are granted on the appraisal of PCFW and carry an interest rate of
v percent per annum.  Neither PCFW nor the cooperatives have the equipment or
the extension services to provide adequate demonstration facilities, or skilled
personnel required to operate modern shore facilities.
19.       Training and research facilities for fisheries have been established
under bilateral aid in Aden and in Mukalla. The center at Aden is now operated
by PCGFV with USSR technical assistance and provides short-term and intensive
training courses mainly in deep-sea fishing. Scholarships for university
degrees abroad (USSR) and training in private companies (Japan) are also
granted. More research could be done on PDRY's fish reseurces, especially
of the rich Ras Fartak fishing grounds off the Sixth Governorate, where it is
indicated that there are large supplies of rock lobsters.   Further harbor
studies are also necessary before a fisheries harbor for the Sixth Governorate
could be developed.
PART IV: THE PROJECT
20.       Following the Government's request for IDA assistance in fisheries
development, a FAO/IBRD Cooperative Program mission prepared the proposed
project in April, 1972. The project was appraised by a Bank mission in
May, 1972, its report entitled "Appraisal of a Fisheries Project People's



Democratic Republic of Yemen", ( 36 a.-YDR ), dated March 27, 1973
is beinL distributed separately.  A credit and project summary is attached
as Annex III, and a map (IERD #10100) showing the project area and other
relevant data is also attac:hed. Negotiations were held in Washington, from
February Lx to 16, 1973. The PDRY delegation was headed by Mr. K. I. Harriri,
Director-General of PCFW, and included Messrs. Yassin Nasser of the Central
Planning Commission and Omar Oboud of the Ministry of Agriculture.
Project Description and Objectives
21.       The proposed project would develop PDRY ts traditional coastal
fishing sector. It would lead to an increase in the fish catch of about
5,700 tons anrually, including valuable species such as tuna, queen-
fish and mackerel. These valuable species would be processed and exported
to international markets. Specifically the project would provide
lor the foreign exchange costs of: (a) construction of shore facilities;
consisting of cold storage refrigeration, freezing and ice making, complemented
by three insulated 5-ton trucks and communication equipment to be located
at M,hukalla and Shihr,  (b) procurement of five inboard l-meter sambuks
complete wFith mechanical haulers for line/net and ar ice box, to be
operated byr PCrFW for demonstration purposes, (c) procurement of 95 inboard l-meter
sambuks complete with ice boxes for the cooperatWives at Mukalla and Shihr,
(d) the services of a naval architect to supervise initial boat construction
and a master fisherman to demonstrate the use of updated fishingf gear, (e)
technical assistance by engineering consultan-ts to design, procure and
supervise the construction of the shore facilities, (f) management consultants
to conduct an in-depth study and make recommendations to strengthen PCFW's
organizational structure and its accounting system, (g) a fisheries
development and harbor study by consultants to the Sixth Governorate, (h)
consultants  to prepare an agricultural/rural development project in the
iVadi Hadramat area and (i) consultants to assist PDRY in preparing a water
supply scheme for Mukalla. PCFW would be responsible for the implementation
of items (a) through (f) of the project, and the Central Planning Commission
would supervise the implementation of items (g) through (i).
22.       the project at full development would generate -nnuallv a,cut
1S 1.2 million in foreizm axchange for PPRY. Of the increased annual catch
about 3.600 tons  would be processed into frozen  products at the
new shore facilities and exported at prices averaging US,$ 330
per ton 3'O  iukalla, the balance of 2,100 tons will be sold in the local
market to make up for the drop in supply as the existing fleet becomes
obsolete.  By shifting lobster processing to the new facilities additional income
estimated at about U3S 200,1000 could also accrue to the economy,resulting from
improved quality of the finished product,
23.       The technical assistance studies could lead to a second j"ishery
Development Project which would rapidly develop the remote eastern region of
PDR7, an agricultural/rural development project for the Wedi Hadramat and a
water supply scheme for Mukalla.



- 7 -
2h.       Adequate supplies of tuna (the most valuable species found in
the project area) are necessary to ensure the economic viability of the
boats and shore facilities provided under the project. In order to ensure
adequate tuna for the project, Government has agreed not to undertake other
tuna-based fisheries projects in the project area without a mutual agreement
with IDA. The content of the proposed project has also been examined in
light of a possible union between PDR- and `YAR. As development of fisheries
resources would play a major role in a unified Yemen, the proposed project
would continue to have high priority in the event of unification.
Project Implementation
25.       The project would be carried out by the F'isheries Projects
Department (FPD) which would be established within the PCFW and responsible
to the Director-General of PCF1. FPD would be headed by a project manager
assisted by a cold storage and refrigeration engineer with local counterpart
and supporting staff. The establishment of rPD and the employment of the
project manager on terms and conditions acceptable to IDA, is a condition of
effectiveness of this credit. FPD would purchase the bulk of the fish
landings from the cooperatives at prices intended to provide the cooperatives
with a fair return while at the same time providing PCFW a sufficient
margin to cover its full costs. To this end, PCFW would meet periodically
with representatives of the cooperatives to review the purchase prices of fish.
FPD would endeavor to stabilize prices and standardize the quality of fish.
It would also be responsible for collecting statistical data and providing
the extension services necessary to train fishermen in modern techniques,
especially in the use of ice for preservation.
26.       The recommendations of the management consultants would provide a
basis for strengthening the institutional base of PCFI and its accounting
system. The new techniques acquired by the local personnel assisting in
the operations would give PCFW the expertise it now lacks, and pave the
way for larger scale fishing operations in the future. As the cooperatives
would now be paying interest and principal on all their borrowing, they would
be obliged to take decisions in a more business-like way.
27.       There are no consultants available locally who could execute
the technical assistance program and foreign consultants would therefore be
employed. Employment of    suitable consultants on terms acceptable to IDA,
to assist FPD in the technical aspects of designing, implementing and supervising t
construction of the shore facilities would be a condition of effectiveness
of the credit.
Project Cost and Financing
28.         The project is estimated to cost $4,185,000 in total, inclusive
of physical and price contingencies (see Annex III for details). PCFW and
the cooperatives are exempt from payment of import duties. The proposed
credit would finance the foreign exchange component, that is, 84 percent
of total cost. The Government would provide $618,000 towards the local cost
and the cooperatives the balance of $67,000 as downpayment for boats. The pro-
ceeds of the IDA credit and the Government's contribution would be allocated as
follows:



- 8 -
a.    The Government would lend PCFW $3,300,000 at 6 percent
interest for 17 years including a five-year grace period.
Of this amount, $2,750,000 would be from the IDA credit
and $550,00O from the Government's own funds. PCFW would
apply $2,715,000 to investment costs for the shore facili-
ties, demonstration vessels and technical assistance and
on-lend $585,000 to the cooperatives for the purchase of
fishing vessels at 6 percent interest for eight years,
including a one-year grace period.
b.    The Government would apply $818,000 to the cost of the
Fisheries Development and Harbor study and for the agri-
cultural and water supply studies referred to above. Of
this amount, $750,000 would be from the credit and $68,000
from the Government.
29.       The cooperatives would be required to mortgage their vessels to
PCFW as security until full paymemt is made. The execution of a subsidiary
loan agreement between the Government and PCFW, acceptable to the Association,
would be a condition of effectiveness of the credit. The PCFW will receive no
interest margin on relending, but the credit program is not expected to add to
PCFW's administrative expenses.
Procurement
30.       A single contract for civil works, equipment for shore facilities,
insulated trucks and other equipment would be awarded on the basis of interna-
tional competitive bidding in accordance with IDA's guidelines. Specifications
and tender documents would be prepared by PCFW with the assistance of the
engineering consultants. International competitive bidding would not be appro-
priate for the five demonstration vessels and the 95 other vessels, since the
traditional hull design, which is well suited to local conditions, requires
builders with the necessary experience. Vessels, therefore, would be procured
by PCFW from local boat yards and in order to simplify maintenance and the
supply of spare parts, fitted with engines and gear directly procured from
suppliers in Aden. The total costs of these items exempted from international
competitive bidding would be about US$ 0.6 million.
Disbursement
31.       The Credit would be disbursed as follows:
a.    Shore facilities,  100 percent of the foreign exchange cost as
stated in the contract, for directly imported equipment, materials
and services, and 65 percent of the cost for civil works;
b.    Fishing vessels,  the CIF cost of directly imported gear and diesel
engines, or 90 percent of total expenditure, if such items are
procured locally, and 65 percent of PCMW's expenditure for hull
construction, representing the estimated foreign exchange component, and



- 9 -
c.  Technical assistance, the foreign exchange costs of consultant's
services and salaries of hired operational personnel.
Justification
32.       The project at full development will generate foreign exchange
earning of US$ 1.4 million annually, US$ 1.2 million from export marketing
and US$ 0.2 million as additional income from high quality lobster processing
at the new shore facilities. The project would offer improved income
opportunities to some 300 fishermen presently working on old and obsolete
vessels and generate about 500 new jobs by fleet expansion. Consequent on
catch and price increases, incomes of fishermen presently employed would
increase by approximately 60 percent from US$ 255 to US$ 400 per annum.
About 50 laborers would be permanently needed for shore facility operations,
while trans-shipment activity would provide additional employment opportunities
for casual laborers. During the development period, the civil works for
shore facilities and the vessel construction program would also provide
employment estimated to total 90 man-years. The estimated rate of return
to the economy would be 30 percent.
PART V: LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHiORITY
33.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the People's
Democratic Republic of Yemen and the Association, the draft Project Agreement
between the Association and the PCFW, the Recommendation of the Committee
provided for in Article V, Section I (d) of the Articles of Agreement of
the Association, and the text of the resolution approving the proposed
credit, are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately. The
provisions of the draft Development Credit and Project Agreements follow
the usual pattern of development credit and project agreements for similar
projects.
34.       I am satisfied that the proposed Development Credit Agreement
would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI: RECOMMENDATION
35.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Development Credit.
