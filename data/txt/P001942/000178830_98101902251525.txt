INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF NIGER
FOR A RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Niger for the equivalent of US$10.7
million on standard IDA terms to help finance a rural development project.
PART I: THE ECONOMY
2.        The problems of economic development in Niger were set out in a
report entitled "Economic Position and Prospects of Niger" dated May 1972
(AW-36a). An economic mission visited Niger in October/November 1973 but
oving to the change of Government that occurred in April 1974, official
comment of the new Government on the draft report could not be obtained.
An economic updating mission visited the country in October 1975. Annex I
contains country data.
Background
3. Niger has been classified by the United Nations as one of the 25 "least
developed" countries in the world. Like its Sahelian neighbors, it suffers
from a number of serious growth constraints: a landlocked position result-
ing in high transport costs; a small domestic market and limited marketing
facilities; poor soils and unfavorable climatic conditions; lack of water
and, so far, cheap energy; and a low level of education, particularly in
the rural areas.
4. The economy shows the typical features of underdevelopment: agriculture
and livestock together account for nearly half of GDP and provide the bulk
of export earnings, making the economy particularly vulnerable to the
vagaries of weather. Mining is still very modest (2 percent of GDP), but
is expected, thanks to uranium, to play a growing role in the future. The
share of industry amounts to little over 10 percent of GDP. Consumption
has been unusually high, ranging between 95 and 100 percent of GDP, and
domestic savings accordingly very low.
Recent Economic Developments
5.        GDP increased moderately up to 1971.   Since then, mainly as a result
of the drought in the Sahel, it has been decreasing at a rapid pace and cannot
be expected to regain its 1971 level in 1975 despite a projected growth rate



- 2 -
of 10 percent over 1974. The drought in the 1973/74 crop year severely
affected agriculture and livestock: production of basic food grains declined
sharply to about 750,000 tons -- 60 percent of what is considered a normal
crop; export crops (groundnuts, cotton) also suffered, both through reduced
yields, and a shift of land and labor to food crops; production of groundnuts,
traditionally the largest export crop, declined 70 percent. As to livestock,
surveys conducted in early 1974 seem to confirm that the size of the pre-
drought cattleherd was almost halved. Accordingly, the income of the rural
population has been sharply reduced, and the southward migration of the popu-
lation accelerated, adding new dimensions to an already difficult economic
situation.
6.        In 1974/75, rainfall was more favorable and crop production
recovered, benefitting also from the Government's timely decision to raise
producer prices for several agricultural commodities. Recovery in livestock
was very slow, as to be expected. Taken together, value added in the
primary sector in 1975 is still estimated to be substantially below its 1972
level.
7.        While reliance on foreign resources has remained important, the
balance of payments has been in surplus since 1969 -- except in 1974 when
falling agricultural exports and skyrocketing import prices resulted in a
more than 100 percent increase in the trade deficit and an overall deficit
of US$16.8 million. The overall surpluses have been made possible by the
increasing inflow of foreign aid (largely grants) and direct foreign invest-
ment related to the first uranium mine (SOMAIR), and by the gradual improve-
ment in the trade balance thanks to growing uranium exports since 1971.
Net foreign assets, which had doubled between 1969 and 1973, dropped to
about US$45 million at the end of 1974, equivalent to three months of imports.
8.        In contrast with a rather depressed real economy, the Government's
financial situation has been relatively healthy in the last five to six years.
Control of current spending and rising revenue, mainly from taxes on the
"modern" sector, enabled the Government to generate increasing budgetary
savings. Large receipts from uranium (CFAF 3-4 billion) are expected in
FY1975/76 following an agreement on higher uranium export prices with the
French Atomic Energy Commission. Whilst some of the major public sector
enterprises are currently experiencing serious financial problems, the
liquidity position of the public sector as a whole continues to be strong.
Treasury deposits with the banking system reached CFAF 8.5 billion in
September 1975, equivalent to about one third of current revenues expected
in FY 1975/1976.
Foreign Aid
9.        During 1968-1973, Niger obtained commitments of an average US$40
million a year from its major traditional sources of aid: France, FED, Canada,
the USA, Germany, IDA and the UN. About 90 percent of total aid disbursements
in the last few years has been grants, and most of the remainder, loans on



- 3 -
concessionary terms. Aid in the drought years 1972/73 and 1973/74, including
emergency food shipments, was about double the annual average level of 1968/73.
10.       External public debt is therefore still quite manageable.   At the
end of 1973, the total amount outstanding was US$116.7 million, of which
US$71.3 million was disbursed. IDA's share of total debt outstanding was
16.1 percent. The ratio of debt service to exports of goods and non-factor
services was 3.5 percent in 1973 and about 5 percent in 1974 (estimate),
mainly due to the decline in exports.
Government Policies and Development Prospects
11.       At the time of the military take-over (April 1974), the previous
government was preparing a ten-year "perspective" program. This has been
abandoned, and the new regime is now preparing a three-year interim develop-
ment program. No details are available so far, but the program's broad
outlines can be summarized as follows: it calls for annual investment of
CFAF 15 billion (US$75 million); highest priority is to be attached to the
development of agriculture and animal husbandry -- the longer-run target
being self-sufficiency in food grains; infrastructure is to be given lower
priority than in the past; industry is to continue to be import-substitution
oriented; mining is to gain momentum thanks to uranium, plans to develop a
coal deposit and, possibly, petroleum exploitation (the discovery of oil in
the desert north of Lake Chad was officially announced in June, but no
indication of its importance was given). This general strategy seems to be
consistent with Niger's development potential.
12.       Shortcomings in project identification, preparation and implemen-
tation have been felt to be major obstacles to timely achievement of plan
targets. Now that the Government faces the problem of how best to use
substantially greater resources than in the past from uranium exploitaition,
appropriate project selection must receive increased attention. To meet
this urgent need, the Government recently created a National Development
Council in which all ministries concerned are represented. The Council is
currently deliberating the organization of the unit which will be in charge
of project identification, preparation and implementation.
13.       Barring major new mineral discoveries, Niger's long-run development
potential lies mainly in agriculture and livestock. Self-sufficiency in
foodstuffs, development of export crops and modernization of the livestock
sector can hardly be achieved without revolutionary changes -- for Niger --
where irrigation and application of advanced technologies are concerned.
But the Government should also pursue more "conventional" development schemes
aimed at increasing productivity, particularly of food crops, since arable
land is becoming increasingly scarce and growth through extensive cultivation
increasingly difficult. In the livestock sector, the Government's intention
of reconstituting the herd to 80 percent of its pre-drought size seems to be
appropriate in view of the limited pasture capacity. The Government also



- 4 -
intends to, and should, take full advantage of the present situation to
change the life pattern of nomadic livestock raisers, i.e. to induce them to
settle down by introducing suitable credit and pasture management policies.
14.       Undoubtedly encouraged by the reported discovery of oil, the
Government will continue to promote mineral prospecting and exploitation.
Besides uranium and oil, interesting indications of phosphate deposits have
been identified. It is impossible at this stage, however, to say to what
extent mineral exploitation can contribute to development, especially in
view of the high transport costs involved. Even under favorable assumptions
regarding this sector, the long-run prospects of the economy cannot be
depicted as bright considering the constraints described in para. 3. Foreign
aid (including technical assistance) will be needed for years to come and
should continue to flow, for some time at least, on highly concessionary
terms.
15.       The Governnment's contribution to the financing of public investment
projects can be expected to increase somewhat in the future, thanks to the
new resources contributed by uranium exports and assuming that policies of
strict budgetary control will be continued. Nevertheless, in view of Niger's
desperate poverty it will be appropriate for external lending agencies to
finance an exceptionally high proportion of project costs, including a sub-
stantial amount of local costs.
PART II: BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN NIGER
16.       To date the Bank Group contribution to Niger's development consists
of six credits. Annex II contains a summary statement of these Credit as at
September 30, 1975. The first, satisfactorily completed in 1969, was made in
1964 to finance a highway development project. The second, for highway main-
tenance, was made in 1968 and is now also fully disbursed. A US$584,000
credit was approved in 1970 for an agricultural project. As of today, only
US$224.000 has been spent. We have proposed (and Government has agreed) to
cancel the remaining amount, since the same kind of activities provided for
under this credit would be financed under the proposed credit. A US$6.5
million credit was made to Niger in 1972 to help finance a highway construction
project which has proceeded satisfactorily. Work on the two roads concerned
is in fact now completed.    In October 1973, the Executive Directors approved
a US$2.0 million credit to Niger within the US$14 million credit extended to
the six. Sahelian countries for drought relief. Finally, a credit of US$5.0
was approved in 1975 for a Niamey airport project.
17.       Recognizing the magnitude of the constraint of inadequate transport
and communications on the development of Niger the Bank Group's strategy in
the country has been so far concentrated mainly on the development of the
internal transportation infrastructure, primarily roads. This strategy has
complemented the efforts of the Government and other aid donors and has
helped lay the foundation of a minimum infrastructure for the development
of the productive sectors in the economy.



- 5 -
18.       Bank Group assistance in the development of the transportation
sector will continue, and a fourth highway project should be ready for sub-
mission to the Executive Directors in the near future. However, future IDA
lending, as the present project suggests, will be increasingly channelled
directly to the two main productive sectors, agriculture and livestock, with
a view to raising the income of the rural population. Possibilities in this
direction include a project for the production of rice under irrigation,
currently under preparation; and a livestock project currently being prepared
by the Fonds d'Aide et de Cooperation (FAC).
19.       Niger remains one of the countries in which external assistance is
limited at present more by the country's capacity to identify, prepare and
implement projects than by shortage of external funds. To alleviate this
constraint, projects financed by the Bank Group in Niger will generally
include elements of technical assistance and training of local staff.
20.       The Bank Group, which ranks sixth in terms of volume of aid committed,
about US$22 million, behind France, the Fonds Europeen de Development (FED),
Canada, USA and Germany, and roughly on a par with the UN, has been a relative-
ly small lender to date, providing only about 7 percent of total foreign aid
committed to Niger during the six years ending 1973.
PART III: THE RURAL SECTOR
21.       The rural sector directly supports about 90 percent of Niger's
population, the large bulk of these (80 percent) being members of farming
families, the remainder being nomadic or semi-nomadic pastoralists. These
rural people are characteristically poor. Per capita income was estimated
in 1970 at CFAF 14,000 annually (US$60). This compares to CFAF 90,000
(US$325) for city dwellers. Moreover, income during the period 1972-1975
decreased significantly, perhaps by as much as 50 percent, as a result of
the drought.
22.       The potential of the sector for increasing total production and
for improving the living standard of rural people is not promising. This is
due primarily to the sector's dependence on rainfall which is both low in
total amount and variable in distribution. Consequently, inadequate rainfall
inhibits rainfed agriculture, which supports the great bulk of rural people,
and, worse, threatens to depress production and income from time to time.
During the drought period 1968-1973, for example, groundnut production dropped
to about a quarter of normal levels, sizeable food imports were necessary and
at least one-third of the nation's cattle were lost, seriously disrupting the
economy.



-6-
Government Strategy
23.       In the rural sector, Government strategy is attempting, first, to
introduce measures that maximize rainfed agriculture, including both crop
and livestock production, and, second, increase the area under controlled
irrigation. It is apparent, however, that, in the short run, improvement of
rainfed agriculture remains the principal means to help the great majority
of the rural population, and the present project is consistent with this
approach. In the long run, however, the impact of such efforts will be
weakened unless population pressure on the land lessens. It is probable, in
fact, that in many areas excessive population may be irreversibly depleting
natural resources. It is clear, in any event, that the problem of population
growth should be given priority. So far, however, Government has yet to
contend with this crucial issue.
24.       Niger has about 55,000 ha that could be irrigated from the Niger
River, and possibly another 100,000 ha from the water resources of the Lake
Chad complex. Governmentsees irrigation as a cushion against the disruptive
impact of drought and as a means for ultimate crop diversification which
would, in turn, encourage new agriculturally-based industries, replace food
imports and possibly generate new exports. Up to now, however, the costs of
irrigation in Niger have been high; nonetheless, Government has embarked on
a modest program of irrigation development of about 800-1,000 ha annually and
has asked the Bank Group for help in financing this program.
25.       Implementation of schemes to benefit large segments of the rural
population is costly. Rainfed farming production programs, for example,
typically involve capital costs, on a per family basis, of the order of
CFAF 80,000 (US$360). Livestock programs are even more costly, at about
CFAF 180,000, and irrigation, extremely expensive at about CFAF 1 million
(US$4,500) per farm family. Moreover, significant recurring costs are asso-
ciated with all such programs. A large volume of foreign aid notwithstanding,
the costs of programs capable of assisting significant numbers of people, as
well as of those essential for improving the country's limited social and
physical infrastructure, are enormous, particularly in the context of the
country;s restricted resources and very thin tax base.
26.       To achieve development within its limited resources, Government
has therefore initiated a policy of sponsoring community development and
farmers' cooperatives. This effort seeks to mobilize the people themselves
in contributing their labor to, for example, the construction of schools
or in organizing themselves for the delivery and recovery of credit.
Government has, in fact, achieved success with such programs, including
teaching (outside of the formal school system) of reading, writing and
counting in tribal languages, as well as organizing self-help in the construc-
tion of simple village water supplies. Government is determined to pursue
such programs as a feasible course of action likely to render benefits to a
significant proportion of the rural community. This approach is practical,
merits support, and would be so supported under the project described in this
report.



- 7 -
27.       Broad development policy is established by the Conseil National
du Developpement (CND). CND is headed by the Vice-President of the Conseil
Militaire Supreme, who is also Ministre du Developpement (MD). CND has its
own secretariat, including a small group of specialists in economics,
agronomy and planning, and is authorized to conduct its own studies. Although
originally intended as a planning unit, solely responsible for making broad
policy proposals for consideration by the Conseil Militaire Supreme, CND may
be empowered by Government to directly supervise development projects (such as
would be the case of the proposed Maradi Project). Within the framework of
policy and strategy established by CND and the Conseil Militaire Supreme, the
MD is responsible for detailed planning and is assisted by the planning units
in the operational ministries, in the case of rural development, the Ministhe
de l'Economie Rurale et du Climat (MERC).
Role of Government
28.       Government intervention in the sector is concerned with price fixing
for principal commodities, especially export crops, and the subsidization of
farm inputs and credits. Price fixing is of practical consequence only in the
case of groundnuts, the single most important foreign exchange earner, and
cotton, for which there are monopoly buying agencies: the Soci4te Nigerienne
de Commercialisation de l'Arachide (SONARA) and the Compagnie Francaise pour
le DAveloppement des Fibres Textiles (CFDT). Official producer prices for
foodcrops tend to be important, for example, when Government's Office des
Produits Vivriers du Niger (OPVN) makes purchases of grain for reserve storage
or for distribution in deficit areas. Until 1974 the official producer prices
paid by OPVN did not keep up with the sharp increases in the free market which
resulted from the general shortage of food in the country, which in turn was
a direct consequence of the drought. The present official producer price of
CFAF 20/kg for sorghum is adequate and competitive with the free market prices.
In the case of groundnuts and cotton, producer prices prior to 1974 were fixed
at unremunerative levels.
29.       In 1974, the new Government increased producer prices for cash crops
significantly: 129 percent for decorticated groundnuts (from CFAF 24/kg to
CFAF 55/kg), and 29 percent for first quality seed cotton (from CFAF 37/kg to
CFAF 47/kg). The producer price for groundnuts now reflects the export value
of the commodity and would have to be reduced in the future if the price pro-
jections of the Bank's Economic Commodities and Export Projections Division
materialize. It is unlikely, however, that Government could reduce groundnut
producer prices in the immediate future, especially in light of the fact that
it is obliged to take account of actions implemented in Nigeria, where ground-
nut growers are subsidized, being presently paid CFAF 66/kg (20 percent more
than in Niger). A relatively high price in Niger is therefore needed to reduce
the risk of groundnut smuggling to Nigeria, a possibility which threatens the
loss to Niger of official export earnings. By contrast, the present producer
price for seed cotton is some 20 percent below the export value of CFAF 58/kg.



- 8 -
30.       Government practices a policy of heavy subsidization of agricultural
inputs. Fertilizer prices to farmers have been kept at CFAF 20/kg since
1972, while import prices of fertilizers have nearly doubled. Insecticides
were given free to cotton growers in 1974 and will be sold for CFAF 450/liter
in 1975. In 1975, the subsidy is 80 percent for fertilizers and about 67
percent for insecticides. In view of the very high cost of fertilizers and
pesticides, all of which must be imported, and the generally backward nature
of Niger's agriculture, subsidies appear necessary to encourage input use.
Nevertheless, a subsidy of 80 percent for fertilizers appears unnecessarily
high, especially in view of the expected decline in Government revenue from
the sector. The Government has agreed that subsidies on fertilizers would
be reduced nationwide to 50% by October 15, 1977 (see Section 4.04 of draft
Credit Agreement).
31.       Agricultural credit is provided by the Caisse Nationale de Credit
Agricole (CNCA) which is wholly owned by Government and works closely with
the Union Nigerienne de Credit et de CoopAration (UNCC), with which it has
a common board of directors, and through whose agents it operates in the
field. Total lending is low (at September 30, 1974, medium-term loans
outstanding totalled only CFAF 423 million--US$1.7 million equivalent).
Marketing and other seasonal credits have been running at about CFAF 300
million annually (US$1.2 million). In the past, interest rates have been
around 10 percent compared with a central bank discount rate of 5.5 percent
in recent years. Government is now considering an interest rate of 2-3 per-
cent, which would involve a major subsidy. For the Maradi Project, interest
rates would be 10 percent for both short and medium-term credit, a level which
ought not to limit significantly the demand for credit.
PART IV: THE PROJECT
32.       A report entitled "Appraisal of Maradi Rural Development Project"
(No. 881a-NIR) is being circulated separately. A credit and project summary,
including a breakdown of costs, is contained in Annex III, and the project
area is shown on the attached map (IBRD 10835). The project is based on
a feasibility study done by the Fonds d'Aide et de Cooperation (FAC) and
on the findings of an IDA appraisal mission undertaken in the fall of 1973.
A change of Government occurred in 1974, and it was not until early 1975
that the new Government reached agreement with IDA on the general organiza-
tion of the project. A second appraisal mission visited Niger in May 1975.
33.       The project would be carried out over a three-year investment
period, 1976-78 and would consist of:
(a)  provision of production packages - extension, applied research,
credit, and input supply - aimed at the improvement of the
productivity of groundnuts, millet and cowpeas grown in the
areas covered by 15 selected Associations Locales de CoopAratives
(ALCs);



(b) strengthening of cooperative institutions;
(c) expansion of educational and training programs, including a
functional literacy program among the project area community;
(d) expansion of a training school for extension workers from a
capacity of 40 to 100, and the provision of training scholarships
for project personnel;
(e) study of the optimum means of developing the irrigation potential
of the Goulbi de Maradi;
(f) pilot development of irrigation in the Goulbi de Maradi through
exploitation of the Goulbi's underground water resources;
(g) construction of 80 km of feeder roads to provide communications
within a fertile but hitherto isolated sector of the project area;
(h) planting of 500 ha of trees in fuel wood plantations;
(i) improvement of livestock services in the project area and
preparation of a livestock development project;
(j) provision of credit for the purchase of livestock by pastoralists
who lost their herds during the Sahelian drought; and
(k) establishment of a project evaluation unit to establish and
record the economic and social impact of the project.
Project Execution
34.       The project would be carried out by a Project Management Unit
(PMU). In the case of its agricultural production components, implementation
would be through farmerst cooperatives. The PMU would be headed by a Project
Manager responsible for day-to-day project implementation. He would report
to the Prefet, who in turn would be accountable to the CND. Coordination
between PMU and other government activities in the Departement de Maradi would
be assured by the Prefet who would be assisted by the Comite Technique
Departemental (COTEDEP). PMU would have four sections: Administrative,
Technical Operations, Cooperative Affairs and Community Development. The
appointment of the heads of the four sections would be a condition of effec-
tiveness of the proposed credit (See Section 3.03(a) (ii) of the draft Credit
Agreement. PMU would be staffed with personnel seconded from the Ministere
de l'Economie Rurale et du Climat (MERC), and the Ministere du Developpement
(MD). A number of project activities would be "contracted," as for example
with MERC--Service de l'Elevage--for the livestock sub-project; Service des
Eaux et Forets, for fuel wood planting material supply; Ministere des Travaux
Publics et du Tourisme, for the road sub-projects and Ministere de la Sante
Publique et des Affaires Sociales, for the health sub-project. During their



- 10 -
initial two to three months with the project, all staff would receive in-
service training courses to acquaint them fully with project objectives and
policies. Selected individuals would receive scholarships and fellowships
for overseas training.    All farm level extension workers would receive up
to seven months training at the Centre de Formation des Jeunes Agriculteurs
(CFJA) in Maradi.
35.       Farmers' cooperatives in Niger are concerned mostly with crop
marketing and still require Government assistance. Thus UNCC functions as
a Government agency rather than as an autonomous cooperative organization.
UNCC staff seconded to PMU's Cooperative Affairs Department would continue
assisting cooperatives and ALCs, and would seek to establish for each ALC
and its member cooperatives a schedule with specific targets for the training
of cooperative members to take over increasing degrees of responsibility for
the management of their societies.
36.       The agency responsible for providing agricultural credit throughout
the country, CNCA, has not had a very good record and only recently has
been reactivated. For these reasons it is proposed that PMU would operate
the credit scheme for participating farmers and employ the cooperatives as
the delivery system for such credit. Farmers would be eligible for seasonal
credits for fertilizers, fungicides, insecticides, improved seeds and live-
stock vaccines; and short-term, 3 years credit, for crop sprayers and animal-
drawn farm equipment. Medium-term credits, 5 years, would be provided for
blacksmiths' equipment. Interest on all loans under the project would be at
10 percent, but no down payment would be required in view of the poverty of
project area farmers.
Detailed Features
37.       The 15 ALCs that would participate in the project have been selected
on the basis of their members' demonstrated acceptance of cooperative activi-
ties and receptiveness to change. On the basis of necessarily crude data,
it is estimated that the 15 ALCs would comprise 150 primary cooperatives, 750
villages and some 37,500 farm families. The ALCs and their member cooperative
societies would be strengthened with trained staff, and would benefit finan-
cially through being used as the channels for credit and input supply and
through marketing project-induced production.
38.       The project includes the expansion of educational and training
programs among the project area community: principally, functional literacy
courses which would be taught by farm level extension agents. The latter would
double as functional literacy teachers during the season when agricultural
activity is at a standstill. Participants would be taught reading, writing
and simple arithmetic in Ilausa, the vernacular. Some 11,000 adults would
participate, of whom 2,000 are expected to become fully literate. The health
training program would be carried out under the supervision of the Ministere
de la Sante Publique et des Affaires Sociales. About 100 first aid assistants
and 100 midwives would be trained under the project.



- 11 -
39.       Under the project, alternatives would be examined to determine the
optimum means of developing the irrigation potential of the Goulbi de Maradi.
Following this and provided that the selected alternative constituted a viable
investment opportunity, a detailed feasibility study and plans for the irri-
gated development of the Goulbi would be prepared. In the expectation that
development of irrigation using groundwater is economic, the project provides
for the development of an estimated 500 ha.
40.       About 80 km of feeder roads would be built southwest of Maradi to
facilitate project actions and generally improve communications in one of
the most fertile areas in the Departement. A total of about 500 ha of fuel
wood plantings would be made in the areas of the 15 ALCs. The objective
would be to establish one plantation of about 3 ha in one out of every five
villages. The livestock services of the Ministere de l'Economie Rurale et
du Climat (MERC) in the Departement de Maradi would receive equipment,
vehicles and finances to conduct routine vaccination campaigns and to treat
calves, sheep and goats against internal parasites. About 750 destitute
pastoralist families who lost everything during the drought would be provided
herds to help reestablish their means of livelihood. A Project Evaluation
Unit would be established to assist in measuring project results.
Marketing and Pricing
41.       Primary marketing of groundnuts would be by the cooperatives
which would sell to Societe Nigerienne de Commercialisation de l'Arachide
(SONARA). Marketing of cereals, cowpeas and vegetables would be through
the traditional network of private traders to whom participating farmers
would sell their products. Groundnut producer prices, as well as prices
paid SONARA by groundnut crushers, are presently adequate. However, to
ensure that prices remain acceptable, Government should establish a clear
pricing and marketing policy.   Objectives of the policy would be producer
prices that provide adequate incentives to farmers, announcement of producer
prices as early as possible and payment of economic prices by the groundnut
processing industry. (see Section 4.05(a) of draft Credit Agreement).
Project Costs and Financing
42.       Project costs net of import duties and other clearly identifiable
taxes are estimated to total CFAF 2,670 million (US$11.9 million) of which
the foreign exchange component would be US$5.9 million or 50 percent. Con-
struction costs of the irrigation schemes assume that the labor needed in
these operations would be provided by the local communities and would be paid
half the minimum daily wage for rural areas. Physical and price contingencies
amount to CFAF 570 million (US$2.5 million) or 24 percent of base costs in-
cluding taxes.
43.       It is proposed that IDA make a credit of US$10.7 million to finance
90 percent of total projects costs excluding import duties and other identi-
fiable taxes. The credit would cover the foreign cost estimated at US$5.9



- 12 -
million, and 81 percent of local costs excluding import duties and other
identifiable taxes. The remaining 10 percent of project costs, net of taxes
(estimated at 10 percent of total project costs), or a total of US$1.2 million,
would be met by Government. To ensure the efficient and timely execution of
the project, assurances were obtained from Government that it would as a
condition of effectiveness deposit an initial amount of CFAF 125 million into
a Project revolving fund (see Section 3.04 of Credit Agreement). Retroactive
financing by IDA of up to US$0.3 million is proposed to finance expansion of
the extension workers' training center and to initiate the seed multiplication
program for the 1976 cultivation season (see para. 4(a) of Schedule I to draft
Credit Agreement).
44.       As the project disbursement period is only for three years, and
experience in Niger has shown that it usually takes up to five years for
cooperatives participating in an intensive agricultural project to generate
sufficient funds to pay for cooperative extension workers, it has been
assumed that Government would finance all support services until 1984, after
which cooperatives would have become entirely self-supporting. Thus, in
addition to making a capital contribution to project investment of CFAF 563
million, Government would be required to allocate some CFAF 380 million
annually subsequent to the third year of the project development period and
until 1984 to maintain agricultural and other services needed to sustain
project benefits. Cost of support services at the above level (equivalent to
CFAF 10,000 per farm family) appears justified given the incremental value
of production induced by the project of CFAF 44,000 annually per farm family
or more than four times the cost of support services.
Procurement and Disbursements
45.       Orders or contracts for equipment, vehicles or chemicals with a
value of more than US$50,000 would be obtained through international com-
petitive bidding (ICB) in accordance with IDA guidelines. Such procurement
is estimated to have a value of US$1.0 million. Contracts of less than
US$50,000 would be procured on the basis of locally advertised competitive
bidding procedures. Fuel, spare parts and items too small to warrant compe-
titive bidding would be procured locally under procedures acceptable to the
Association. Construction of the irrigation schemes would be by the pros-
pective users. As there are no local contractors to build the roads, which
are too small and dispersed to attract foreign contractors, the roads would
be constructed by the Ministere des Travaux Publics by force account. Con-
tracts exempted from international competitive bidding would aggregate no more
than US$1.9 million.
46.       Consultants providing technical assistance and carrying out the
various required studies (US$1.1 million) would be recruited internationally
according to IDA guidelines.
47.       The IDA credit would finance 100 percent of the foreign exchange
cost of vehicles and equipment; fertilizers, insecticides and other farm
inputs; vaccines; PMU expatriate staff salaries and operating costs; and
studies, auditors and scholarships; and 89 percent of all other project items,



- 13 -
except the salaries of civil servants posted to the project, which would be
financed 100 percent by Government. Disbursement of the IDA credit would be
against import documentation and certified records of expenditures. For
disbursements made against certified records of expenditures, documentation
would not be submitted for review as a matter of course, but would be re-
tained by PMU for scrutiny by Bank supervision missions. Any surplus credit
funds, after completion of the project, would be used to develop further
services to farmers.
Benefits and Justification
48.       The overall impact of the project, at full development in 1982, is
seen as bringing up future average yields in the 15 project area ALCs to close
to those obtained in the years of most favorable rainfall over the period
1967-1975. Yield increases are estimated to result in increments in annual
production amounting to 18,100 tons of millet, 19,800 tons of un-shelled ground-
nuts and 600 tons of cowpeas by 1982. New production from project-established
irrigation schemes is estimated at 500 tons of seed cotton, 900 tons of sor-
ghum and 7,000 tons of tomatoes and other vegetables. Project-induced live-
stock production would amount to 18,700 tons liveweight compared with 15,700
tons without the project.
49.       Farmers' gross income from crop production, at 1975 prices, exclud-
ing any income from participating in either the irrigation or the livestock
component of the project, would increase some 47 percent between 1976 and
1982, and net income per day worked would increase from an average of CFAF
179 to CFAF 298 by 1982. Net income from a 0.50 ha irrigated holding is
estimated to amount to CFAF 67,000 by the fourth year of its development
after payment of all direct expenses and provision for capital recovery.
50.       The project's direct benefits would be the increased production
it would generate which would result in higher incomes for some 37,500 farm
families and 14,000 pastoral families. The economic rate of return from
investment in the project is estimated at 39 percent over 25 years.
51.       The technical risks attached to the project are not considered
large, although one problem which cannot be eliminated or significantly
reduced is that inherent in the climatic vagaries which bedevil Niger. The
project's relatively high rate of return shows that its economic viability
would not be jeopardized by the statistically unlikely recurrence of drought
of the magnitude experienced in the period 1967-1974.
52.       The project would have a number of secondary benefits not reflected
directly in the economic rate of return calculations. Among these (a) the
impact of the functional literacy and health training programs; (b) the
demonstration effect of an integrated approach to rural development; (c) the
planning of the development of the irrigation potential of the Goulbi; (d)
the expansion of non-farm rural employment; and (e) the improvement of nutri-
tion.

PART V: LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
53.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Association and
the Republic of Niger, the recommendation of the Committee provided for in
Article V, section l(d) of the Articles of Agreement of the Association and
the text of a Resolution approving the proposed Development Credit, are
being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
54.       The draft Development Credit Agreement conforms to the normal
pattern for credits for rural development projects. Features of special
interest are referred to in paragraphs 30 and 43 of this report. The
following are additional conditions of effectiveness; (i) the establishment
of and initial deposit in the revolving fund referred to in paragraph 44;
(ii) the establishment of the PMU; and (iii) that the heads of the four
sections of PMU, referred to in para. 34, have been appointed.
55.       I am satisfied that the proposed development credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI: RECOMMENDATION
56.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Credit 207 - Agricultural Credit Project; US$584,000 Credit of June 9,
1970; Closing Date - December 31, 1975
Disbursements have been much lower than expected due to: lack of demand
until recently due to the drought; the existence of large inventories of
fertilizers and other inputs at the beginning of the project; Niger's poorly
developed credit, input and extension delivery systems. We have proposed
and Government has agreed, to cancel the remaining amount of this credit.
Appropriate procedures are now being initiated to this end.

Credit 231 - Second Highway Construction Project; US$6.55 million Credit
of January 29, 1971 (as amended on November 26, 1973);
Closing Date - December 31, 1975
Work on the Niamey-Tillabery road (115 km) and on the Magaria-Tinkim-
Dan Tyao (28 km) has been completed. Detailed engineering for the Niamey-
Baleyara road was dropped at Governmentts request since its construction
was found to be premature. Detailed engineering on the Maradi-Djibyia
road (49 km) was substituted in its place. The Zinder-Bande road study
was extended to the Nigerian border as assurances were received by Nigeria
that the connecting road Babura-Kunyia would be constructed. Construction
of the roads will be included in the Third Highway Project.
Credit 441 - Drought Relief Project; US$2.0 million Credit of December 7,
1973; Closing Date - June 30, 1976
The credit, approved on November 13, 1973, is one of six credits made
to the six sahelian countries to help people in drought-affected areas to
reestablish their self-sufficiency through redevelopment and improvement
of their farms and herds. The Banque de Developpement de la Republique du
Niger (BDRN) is serving as the intermediary for channeling funds to the
different Government agencies who have responsibility for the execution
of various sub-projects.
Credit 473 - Niamey Airport Project; US$5.0 million Credit of May 24, 1975;
Closing Date - December 31, 1976
This credit provides for improvements to existing facilities so as to
enable modern, large body aircraft to operate safely and economically to and
from Niamey Airport. The project provides for strengthening and lengthening
the runway, strengthening of the taxiway, enlarging and strengthening the
aircraft parking apron as well as the upgrading and relocation of the Instru-
ment Landing System. Work began on the civil works portion of the project
in May 1975 and is expected to be completed by September 1976. Due to cost
increases and currency realignments, supplementary financing of up to US$1.0
million may be needed at a later date.

Procurement               Orders or contracts for equipment, vehicles or
Arrangements:           chemicals with a value of more than US$50,000 would
be obtained through international competitive
bidding (ICB) in accordance with IDA guidelines.
Such procurement is estimated to have a value of
US$1.0 million. Contracts of less than US$50,000
would be procured on the basis of locally advertised
competitive bidding procedures.    Fuel, spare parts
and items too small to warrant competitive bidding
would be procured locally under procedures accept-
able to the Association. Construction of the irri-
gation schemes would be by their-prospective users.
As there are no local contractors to build the roads,
which are too small and dispersed to attract foreign
contractors, the roads would be constructed-by the
Ministere des Travaux Publics by force account.
Contracts exempted from international competitive
bidding would aggregate no more than US$1.9 million.
Consultants:              Consultants providing technical assistance and
carrying out the various required studies (US$1.1
million) would be recruited internationally accord-'
ing to IDA guidelines.
Economic Rate of
Return:                 The economic rate of return from investment in the
project is estimated at 39%.
