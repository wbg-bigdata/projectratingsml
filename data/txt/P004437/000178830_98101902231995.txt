REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES FOR AN
INTER-ISLAND SHIPPING PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Republic of the Philippines for the equivalent of $20.0 million. The
loan would be for a term of 18 years, including a grace period of 4 years
and at an interest rate of 8%. The proceeds of the loan would be relent on
the same terms to the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) for onlending
at an interest rate of 12% with various terms for the acquisition of new
and used ships and for major repairs and conversions.
PART I - TiE ECONOMY
2.        The most recent Economic Report - "Current Economic Position and
Prospects of the Philippines" (No. 78-PH of April 20, 1973) was circulated
to the Executive Directors on May 2, 1973 (R73-85). An economic mission
visited the Philippines in April and its preliminary conclusions are
incorporated below. The full report of the mission will be distributed to
the Executive Directors shortly. Annex I contains a summary of country
data.
Recent Developments
3.        Since 1972, the Government has re-formulated its development
strategy by introducing a number of important and potentially far-reaching
economic and social reforms through decrees in such areas as agrarian reform,
taxation, customs administration and tariffs, banking and government organi-
zation. These reforms provide an opportunity to improve the performance of
the Philippine economy. Aided by the recent commodity boom in the inter-
national markets, economic activity in the Philippines has increased consid-
erably. The growth in real GNP, which had been about 5% a year for more
than a decade, is estimated to have doubled and reached 10% in 1973. However
underemployment and unemployment remain quite high, and in common with most
other countries the rate of inflation has increased appreciably in the past
year. These problems and the long-term implications of the energy crisis
for domestic production, the balance of payments, costs and employment are
now being examined by the economic mission.
4.        The strong recovery of the economy in 1973 resulted from increased
agricultural production, a recovery in the industrial sector including
manufactured exports, a boom in export incomes and an expansion in public
and private investment. The agricultural sector, which had suffered from
adverse weather conditions during the previous three years grew by 11% in
1973. Rice production in 1973-74 is estimated to have increased by 25% over
the level of the previous year when floods reduced production levels. This
increase has been mainly due to favorable weather conditions, increased use
of fertilizers, more supervised credit and increased investments in support-
ing rural services as part of a general drive for rice self-sufficiency.



- 2 -
The impact of the recent floods on rice production in the present crop year
appears to be moderate, chiefly because of the short duration of the typhoon,
and the quiick drainage and protection provided by the rehabilitation work
undertaken after the 1972 disaster. The Government has vigorously implemented
a program of agrarian reform among rice and corn tenants concentrating mainly
on the larger holdings in the first phase. Titles are being transferred to
tenants and supporting services improved.
5.        The increased activity in agriculture has provided the base for
renewed expansion of the industrial sector. The growth of industrial produc-
tion for exports has also been stimulated by the Government's industrial
export drive which included a range of export incentives. Nontraditional
industrial exports, which have been increasing since 1970, are estimated to
have doubled in 1973 to about $200 million. The prospects of increased
profitability are attracting a large amount of new investment into industries
such as plywood, textiles and garments, handicrafts, light consumer durables
and electronics.
6.        The growth in production was also assisted by the sharply acceler-
ated public development outlays in 1973 made possible by a significant im-
provement in the financial position of the Government. The Government has
implemented a series of long-needed tax reforms and improvements in tax
administration, such as customs and tariff reform, tax amnesties, reforms
in corporate and local taxation, continuation of the export tax, and increased
taxation on luxury items and on gasoline. These reforms resulted in a 37%
increase in tax revenues in FY73, and an estimated 40% in FY74. As a
result the ratio of Central Government tax revenues to GNP has increased
from an average of 9% in recent years to an estimated 12% in FY74.
7.        High prices for the Philippines' chief exports, including cocorut
products, sugar, copper and wood products, were largely responsible for an
increase in merchandise receipts of almost 70% in 1973. The merchandise
trade account recorded a surplus of about $270 million, as compared with a
$120 million deficit in the previous year. International reserves rose by
$594 million during the year and stood at $876 million, equivalent to about
five months of imports, at the end of the year, and had risen to $1.2
billion by May 1974.
8.        However, in the latter part of 1973 inflation emerged as a major
problem in the Philippines. Since mid-1973 consumer prices have been rising
at an annual rate of more than 40%. This has been caused by the higher rate
of world inflation, by higher export prices, by domestic food shortages, and
more recently by the increased cost of petroleum. Provided there is a
good harvest this year, the rate of inflation should moderate in 1975, but
it probably will take 1-2 years for the price effects of the energy crisis
to work themselves out fully. The rapid inflation has also exacerbated
the decline in real wages which fell by a total of about 25% between 1969
and 1973. The urban wage earners have been most affected. In the past
year, agricultural incomes have improved very substantially, while, with



-3-
some exceptions, entrepreneurs have been able to pass on increased costs.
Money wages will have to be raised in the near future if further deterioration
in the living standards of wage earners is to be avoided.
The Energy Crisis
9.        Imported petroleum provides some 93% of the Philippines' total
energy requirements. In 1973 the equivalent of 71 million barrels of
petroleum crude and other petroleum products were imported at a cost of
about $230 million c.i.f. When the energy crisis developed late last year,
it looked as though economic activity in the Philippines would be severely
disrupted. There were temporary dislocations while reduced quantities of
petroleum were available, but the Government moved quickly with conservation
measures to reduce non-essential consumption. By March these problems had
been overcome and the Philippines is now obtaining sufficient petroleum for
its needs. In 1974 imports of petroleum and products are likely to be about
73 million barrels at a cost of about $820 million c.i.f.
10.       In response to the energy crisis, the Government has decided to
accelerate the development of local energy sources, especially hydropower
and geothermal energy. These will be supplemented with nuclear energy in
the 1980's. The transport sector, which now accounts for 40% of total
energy consumption, is likely to continue to be the major consumer of energy.
The growth in demand for energy will therefore be influenced by policies
that affect the pattern of expansion in this sector. In any event, total
demand for energy is expected to grow at about 10 percent a year, and even
with more rapid development of natural power sources, petroleum would still
account for 85% of total energy needs by 1980. The Philippines does not
have any commercial oil fields, but the Government has recently taken steps
to encourage more exploration.
Growth Prospects
11.       Earlier this year the Government decided that, despite the energy
crisis and rapid inflation, the growth momentum built up last year should be
maintained, to provide for a continued increase in employment and to ensure
that export income expands rapidly enough to meet most of the country's for-
eign exchange needs. The labor force will continue to grow at almost 3% a
year for another decade. Providing half a million new jobs a year as well
as dealing with unemployment and underemployment will be a major task.
12.       The economy has the potential to continue growing at 7-8% a year
in real terms. This growth is not likely to be seriously constrained by lack
of foreign exchange. Despite the big increase in the cost of petroleum
and other imports, there will be only a modest deficit in the overall balance
of payments this year, because of continued high prices for major export
commodities. Moreover, the rapid increase in export prices at a time when
external debt has not been changing, has resulted in a sharp fall in debt
service from 23% of export earnings in 1972 to an estimated 14% this year.
There has also been a substantial improvement in the climate for private



- 4 -
investment in the Philippines, especially in exports. Unless there is a
calamitous drop in export prices, the Philippines should be able to maintain
a reasonable balance of payments position throughout the rest of the decade.
There will probably be a substantial increase in financing requirements, but
with rising domestic incomes and a substantially improved capacity to borrow
abroad, it should be possible to mobilize the needed resources.
13.       A substantial increase in both public and private investment to
support the growth and employment strategy is required, with priority being
given to increasing food production, to export ventures and to selective
import-,.1-acing investments. The Government plans to spend about P 17 bil-
lion on infrastructure and other public investments during FY74-77; about
40% of the proposed investment program would be allocated to the transport
sector, 21% to power and 13% to irrigation. This would mean doubling the pro-
portion of these expenditures to GNP from 1.7% in FY68-72 to about 3.5%
in FY74-77. To finance this program, the ratio of taxes to GNP would
have to be increased to 15-16%, and public savings would have to be raised
from the present level of 1.4% of GNP to beyond 2% in the next few years.
With the Government's program for further tax reforms, there are reasonable
prospects for achieving these objectives. Even so, it would mean continued
heavy reliance on public borrowing from the local market and from abroad.
Implementing this program would also call for continued improvements in
public sector management which has already been strengthened by the Govern-
ment reorganization.
14.       The improved climate for private investment is attributable to the
strong performance of the economy in 1973 after three years of stagnation,
the current higher prices for many commodities, and the efforts of Govern-
ment to attract more foreign investment. A number of big projects are pro-
posed in mining, wood processing, fertilizer, steel, aluminum and other
industries which seem likely to push up the private investment rate from
recent levels of about 16% of GNP to perhaps 22% by the latter part of the
decade. A large portion of the funds for these projects is likely to come
from abroad. Even so, the supply of long-term funds from domestic sources
will need to increase substantially.
Balance of Payments
15.       Because of continued highi prices for major export commodities,
export receipts are expected to increase by 33% this year to $2.5 billion.
Merchandise imports are likely to increase by about 90% to $3.1 billion,
because of the increased cost of petroleum and the rapid increases in the
prices of other imports. In response to the energy crisis, the Central Bank
negotiated a series of standby credits with various foreign commercial banking
groups earlier this year. The economic mission estimates that the overall
balance of payments will record a deficit of about $100 million this year.
16.       After allowing for continued reserve accunulation and repayment of
loans, the total foreign exchange requirements for the period 1975-79 would
be about $7 billion. About $2.5 billion would be provided by remittances,



official grants, direct investment, and short-term trade finance. The re-
maining $4.5 billion would have to come from foreign borrowing. Last year
the Bank estimated total requirements for 1974-78 at about $4 billion. In
June 1973 the Consultative Group for the Philippines met and accepted the
need for rising levels of commitments for development projects to support
the Philippines' increased development program. The increased estimate of
requirements reflects the effects of inflation, the more optimistic outlook
for growth in the Philippines, and the improved capacity to carry foreign
debt.
17.       Borrowing on this scale would not pose serious problems for balance
of payments and external debt management. At the end of 1973, the Philippines'
medium and long-term external debt stood at about $1.9 billion, of which pub-
lic debt was 44%. Because the Government has exercised strict control over
the amount and type of new external borrowings, the total amount of debt out-
standing has not increased much since 1970, and the maturity structure has
improved. Moreover, the debt service ratio is expected to remain at about
14% in 1975. With this moderate debt burden the Philippines will be able to
contract substantially larger amounts of external debt which would probably
lead to a small increase in the debt service ratio, perhaps to about 14-15%
by the early 1980s.
18.       The Philippines' development program will continue to require
resources in excess of the foreign capital which will become available for
financing the import component of development projects. Some financing of
local currency expenditures will be justified, especially for projects of
economic and social importance which need only limited amounts of foreign
exchange.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN THE PHILIPPINES
19.       The Philippines has received 25 Bank loans and three IDA credits
totalling $552 million, net of cancellations. About 52% of the Bank/IDA
lending, $286 million, has been for infrastructure projects in power, trans-
portation, water supply and for education whilst $25 million has been for
population. The remainder has been divided about equally between agri-
culture and industry. Of this, $126 million has been for irrigation,
livestock, rice processing and rural credit and $115 million for industry
in three loans to the Private Development Corporation of the Philippines
and one loan to the Development Bank of the Philippines. There has been a
marked improvement in the way Bank financed projects in the Philippines have
been executed in the last two or three years compared with experience in
the 1960's when shortages of peso counterpart funds combined with poor
administration caused serious problems. Apart from the rice processing
project, where some major changes made necessary by changed circumstances
have recently been made, all these projects are now going well. Annex II



contains a summary statement of Bank loans, IDA credits and IFC investments
as of August 31, 1974, and notes on the execution of on-going projects.
20.       The size of the Bank/IDA lending program increased substantially
in FY74, reflecting the ambitious development program of the Government and
its improved capacity to prepared and implement projects. Commitments in
FY74 amounted to $165.1 million compared to an average of about $30 million
a year in the previous five years. Future Bank lending will continue to
concentrate on public infrastructure and agriculture.   We will also con-
tinue to help industry and provide more assistance for projects in the
social sectors.
21.       In addition to the loans already approved bv the Executive
Directors for the Population and Sixth Power Projects, the FY75 lending
program is expected to include loans for the following projects -- Fourth
Industrial Credit (PDCP), Tarlac Irrigation, Mindoro Rural Development, and
Small Industry. The Fourth Industrial Credit (PDCP) loan would provide funds
to PDCP for relending to finance direct imports for projects, mainly in manu-
facturing industry. The Tarlac Irrigation project would help improve irrigation
systems in a heavily tenanted area of Luzon. The Rural Development project
would help finance a range of rural investments designed to promote the
integrated development of the island of Mindoro. The Small Industry loan
would provide funds for relending to small firms and possibly technical
assistance to help strengthen the institutions serving these firms.
22.       Beginning in 1972 the Philippines received some financing from IDA,
but on the basis of a reappraisal of the prospects for the Philippines'
balance of payments, and in view of the sharply increased needs of the poorer
members of IDA for concessional assistance, further IDA lending to the Philip-
pines does not appear to be justified. The Philippines has the capacity to
borrow substantial amounts abroad to finance some of the costs of the
increased investment program now planned. At present the Bank/IDA share in
total debt outstanding is about 9% and its share in debt service is about
5.5%. Since the Philippines will have the capacity to service more commercial
debt in future, it is unlikely that the Bank's share in debt service will rise
even with a higher level of lending.
23.       IFC has made commitments in the Philippines totalling $69.2 million
for investments in eleven companies in the fields of development banking,
power, telecommunications, ceramic tiles, paper, petroleum products, nickel
mining and refining, chemicals and synthetic fibers. Of these investments,
as of August 31, 1974, $18.2 million have been sold, $0.4 million cancelled
and $1.8 million repaid, leaving a net porpolio of $48.8 million. On the
same date $13.0 million was undisbursed. Preliminary proposals have been
received for an aluminum smelter and other projects in the pulp and paper,
dinnerware, metal alloys and shipbuilding fields.



- 7 -
PART III - THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
23.       Ports and shipping play a dominant role in the transport sector of
the Philippines and continue to provide the most important means of transport
and communication between the islands of the archipelago. In recent years
an expanding network of highways, particularly on Luzon, has provided access
to the interiors of the larger islands, and road transport has played an
increasingly important role. The relatively short inland distances have
limited the railways to a small fraction of the total traffic. Development
of the transport sector has had a history of haphazard planning and poor
coordination compounded by a lack of funds which has made it impossible
to maintain or improve transport facilities to adequate levels in an
archipelago where numerous islands, difficult terrain and heavy rainfall have
always been natural obstacles to the provision of transport infrastructure.
Over the past eighteen months, there has been a substantial increase in the
amount of funds made available for infrastructure investment and maintenance,
and the agencies concerned with infrastructure planning and coordination are
being overhauled.
24.       The Philippine merchant fleet totalled approximately 1.6 million
gross registered tons (GRT) in 1971. This includes 130 ocean-going vessels
totalling 830,000 GRT and 130 inter-island vessels of over 1,000 GRT each
totalling about 280,000 GRT, the remainder being craft of under 1,000 GRT
each. About 65% of the interisland fleet and 41% of the ocean-going fleet were
20 or more years old in 1971. In 1968, seven new cargo/passenger vessels for
inter-island services, of 7,000 deadweight tons each, were bought with aid
from the Federal German Republic. More recently, a few tankers and cargo
vessels have been acquired with private external financing. Some vessels are
poorly maintained, built to obsolete standards and ill-suited to modern
cargo-handling methods and their safety record is also poor. This applies
particularly to the inter-island services.
25.       There are some 90 national and 390 municipal ports throughout the
Philippine archipelago, plus numerous private piers and wharves. Some six
national ports handle all the international traffic which goes through
public ports. Manila, much the largest public port, accounts for about 70%
of all imports and 5% of exports. The other ports handle inter-island
traffic only. Most of the public ports are small and the Government envisages
the gradual elimination of the less economic ports from the national system.
This is being achieved through the concentration of investment at selected
locations, a process which should yield economies of scale. Most of the
public ports are poorly maintained and have not been designed for modern
cargo-handling techniques. Sheds are often lacking, although private ware-
houses are usually available nearby. Cargo-handling is generally in the
hands of private companies, and many ports lack equipment.
26.       The highway network consists of about 16,000 km of paved roads,
38,000 km of gravel, and 20,000 km of unimproved roads. The highways of
Luzon and Mindanao comprise three-quarters of the entire system, most of



- 8 -
the rest being on the main islands of the Visayas. The condition of the
road system is generally poor, with even the national primary and secondary
roads in a deteriorated condition, because of inadequate maintenance.
27.       The most important railway is the wholly Government owned Philippine
National Railways (PNR), which has about 1,000 km of main line and 1,000 km
of branch lines on the island of Luzon. The main line is paralleled by high-
ways for most of its length. Management and operation of the railway has been
poor and unprofitable and maintenance of facilities inadequate. PNR has been
carrying out an improvement program since 1972 and in FY74 expects an
operating surplus as a result of increased traffic, increased tariffs, and
improved cost control. The next phase of the program is to rehabilitate the
track.
28.       Manila, the only international airport in the Philippines is served
by Philippine Air Lines (PAL) and 15 other airlines. An extensive network
of domestic airports is now served by PAL, which took over the two other
major domestic airlines at the end of 1973. Domestic passenger traffic has
been increasing at about 17% a year over recent years.
Transport Planning and Coordination
29.       As part of the continuing GovernmLent reorganisation, transport planning
is now the joint responsibility of the National Economic and Development
Authority (NEDA), the Department of Public Works, Transportation and Communica-
tions (DPWTC), the Department of Highways (DPH), the proposed Philippine Port
Authority (PPA) and the Maritime Industry Authority (MIA).    The changes stemmed
in part from a UNDP financed Transport Survey in 1970, for which the Bank
was executing agency. Further recommendations on organisation and planning
were made by consultants employed in connection with Bank financed projects.
Each agency will have a planning service responsible for transport planning
within its respective jurisdictions. The Pnilippine Port Authority and the
Maritime Industry Authority are new organizations and they are in the process
of organizing their planning services. The PNR is responsible for planning
railway development.
30.       Inter-island shipping regulation is now to be carried out by the
MIA, as part of that agency's regulatory powers over the maritime industry.
The main objective in exercising these powers is to provide better coordination,
rather than increased control, of the maritime industry. This should improve
the efficiency of the sector.
31.       The Government's four-year public infrastructure program for highways
and ports (1974-77) calls for a very substantial increase in public investment,
and a large number of transportation projects have been identified. This
emphasizes the importance of the role of planning in the various Government
Agencies in establishing priorities amongst competing projects, since the
Government clearly will not be able to implement all the projects proposed
within this period. DPWTC is already receiving technical assistance, financed
by the UNDP, in its physical planning studies. A general improvement in the



quality of basic data is also required. Steps have already been taken to
improve the planning and implementation of highway projects. The Government
is also strengthening the Port Programming and Planning Branch of the Bureau
of Public Works (BPW) to improve the collection of data and the preparation
of projects for all national ports. A Philippines Ports Authority is being
established with technical assistance financed under the Bank's second ports
project (Ln. No. 939-PH). It will have responsibility for developing a na-
tional port policy and will have general jurisdiction over all port districts.
The MIA will collect data for shipping consistent with that collected for
ports.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
32.       The proposed project was identified in July, 1973 by a Bank
reconnaissance mission. It follows a series of four previous Bank loans
for transport infrastructure development in the Philippines, the most recent
of which was the Second Highways Project (Ln. No. 950 - PH) in 1973. A
Bank mission appraised the project in January 1974 and negotiations were held
in June 1974. The leader of the Government's negotiating team was Miss Fe
Villafuerte. The Appraisal Report (No. 437a-PH) on the project is being
distributed to the Executive Directors separately. Annex III provides a
loan and project summary.
33.       A principal purpose of the loan would be to assist in strengthening
existing institutions and establishing a new institution serving the shipping
sub-sector. Therefore the loan would also assist in the establishment
and organization of the MIA, the formulation of a maritime industry develop-
ment program, as well as providing technical assistance to DBP. The loan
would encourage increased efficiency and improved safety standards of the
inter-island fleet, and would help to improve Government coordination and
supervision of the shipping sector. The proposed loan of $20.0 million
would be made to the Government, for on-lending through DBP. The Bank has
previously made three agricultural loans and one industrial loan through
DBP. The proposed loan would provide financing for the acquisition,
conversion and major repair of vessels of the inter-island fleet, with em-
phasis on replacement of ships over 20 years of age and the major repair of
ships up to 16 years of age. As of December 31, 1973, DBP's Maritime Section
had a shipping portfolio of 14 loans and 6 guarantees totalling V 233 million
(US$34.7 million). This was less than 1% of its total portfolio. Nine loans
and 5 guarantees had been in arrears (principal and interest) for over one
year. This reflects both a past weakness in DBP's appraisals, and the
effects of the revaluation of the Deutsche Mark, the currency of
denomination for the bulk of its shipping loans.
34.       The Government would relend the loan proceeds, at the same interest
rate, to DBP, which would in turn on-lend the funds to shipowners at an in-
terest rate of 12% in all cases and for terms of (i) up to 16 years including
2 years grace for new ships, (ii) between 8 and 12 years including 6 months



- 10 -
grace for used ships and (iii) up to 5 years, including one year's grace for
conversions and major repairs. Sub-borrowers would assume the foreign ex-
change risk on the currencies of the countries from which goods and services
are procured. The Government would bear any residual exchange risk between
this currency and the currency owed to the Bank.
35.       DBP was established in 1958 as a wholly Government-owned develop-
ment bank. Its financing in the past four years accounted for 11% of total
fixed investment in the Philippines. The bulk (79%) of its lending is for
industrial financing followed by agricultural financing (9%) with the bal-
ance of 1?% going for municipal lending, lending to private development banks
and for real estate. DBP has experienced severe financial difficulties in
recent years principally because heavy debt-service obligations were incurred
as a result of guaranteeing a large amount of private foreign borrowing between
1965 and 1970. Although the situation remains serious, it is improving and
arrears now relate mainly to those foreign currency guarantees made by DBP
before the de facto devaluation of 1970. The Maritime Section in DBP's In-
dustrial Department would have the main responsibility for handling sub-proj-
ects to be financed under the proposed loan. It has a well qualified and
competent staff of 21, which has the capability to undertake adequate proj-
ect appraisal. DBP would further strengthen its maritime lending operations
by hiring a maritime finance expert and a maritime technical expert, each for
two years to act as advisers. They may be financed from bilateral sources,
in which case the funds earmarked for this purpose under the loan could be
used by DBP for additional sub-projects under the proposed loan. The
Maritime Section would work within the guidelines of the Statement of
Operating Policies and Procedures, adopted by DBP in connection with the
Industrial Investment Credit Project (Ln. No. 998-PH). The Bank would also
review the first ten sub-projects under the loan, after which a free limit
for sub-loans would be established. These arrangements would ensure that
Bank funds would go to shipping projects which are economically as well as
financially sound.
36.       The Government has established MIA to place coordination and super-
vision of the maritime industry within one agency. MIA is responsible for
issuing certificates of registration, and for organizing a data collection
system for shipping. MIA will also prepare a ten-year Maritime Industry
Development Program within two years of its inception. Technical assistance
will also be provided from a recognized international ship classification
society. The Philippine Coast Guard will be assisted by MIA in carrying out
its ship inspection services. As in the case of the technical assistance
for DBP, technical assistance for MIA will be financed either from bilateral
aid or from the loan if bilateral funds are not available.
Cost of the Project
37.       The total cost of the project is $34.1 million, with an estimated
foreign exchange component of about $32 million (93% of total project costs).
The proposed Bank loan would finance 59% of the total cost of the project



- 11 -
(63% of the foreign exchange costs). This percentage may vary because
shipowners may choose to finance a larger proportion of a sub-loan with
their own equity than expected, and because in the case of sub-loans for
used ships DBP's contribution will vary depending on the age of the ship
to be acquired.  For new ships DBP's loans would cover 80% of the procure-
ment cost, for used ships 50-60% of the cost (depending on the age of the
ship acquired), and for major repairs and conversions, about 80% of the
cost. Since DBP sub-loans would not cover the full foreign exchange cost
of ships acquired abroad, the Government would ensure that shipowners would
be able to obtain the additional foreign exchange needed to cover their
equity contribution in the imported ship. The estimates include the cost
of construction of new ships, procurement of second hand ships, and
conversion or repair of existing inter-island ships. Both construction of
new ships and repair of existing ships may be carried out locally. The
estimates also include funds for technical assistance to MIA and DBP in
the event that bilateral financing cannot be arranged.

Procurement
38.       Procurement of new ships would be on the basis of international
competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's guidelines, against owner's
outline specifications approved by DBP's Maritime Section. Since some new
ships may be built in the Philippines, a preference of 15% of the c.i.f.
price of the imported vessel, or the customs duty if lower, would be extended
to domestic ship builders in the evaluation of bids. Procurement of used
ships would be on the basis of quotations secured by DBP from international
shipbrokers, due account being taken of price, suitability, delivery time
and costs of having the ships brought up to international classification
standards.
39.       Ship conversions and repairs to be financed under the loan do
not lend themselves to international competitive bidding because of tlle
specialized nature of the work and the small amount of each sub-project -
about $200,000. Contracts for the work would be let in accordance with
normal commercial practice, and are unlikely to be carried out abroad,
since Philippine shipyards are very competitive. Repairs would be carried
out according to the technical standards of an international classification
society. Materials would be procured from local commercial sources where
international suppliers are widely represented.



- 12 --
Disbursement
40.       The Bank would reimburse DBP for the full amount of its sub-loans
to shipowners except for major repairs or conversions where the Bank will
finance 75% of the sub-loans (the estimated foreign exchange cost). For
consultant's services, disbursement would be on the basis of actual foreign
exchange costs.  DBP is expected to co.     the Bank's loan over two years
and fully disburse it within four years.
Economic Justification
41.       Inter-island traffic has increased at about 5% a year for freight
and at about 7.5% a year for passenger traffic over the last 10 years. Freight
traffic, estimated at about 1 million tons a year in the early 1960's had in-
creased to 3.5 million tons a year by 1972. Passengers carried totalled
1.5 million in the early 1960's and had likewise increased to some 3.5 mil-
lion in 1972. The growth in freight traffic has been caused largely by
the growing importance of Mindanao as a supplier of foodgrains to Luzon and
the Visayas and by the dominance of Manila as the industrial center of
the Philippines. The growth in passenger traffic is a result of increasing
urbanization and transmigration, together with rising income levels and
the close ties which Filipinos maintain with their home provinces. Traffic
is likely to grow faster in the future in line with a more rapid overall
rate of economic growth. Annual growth rates for freight and passenger
traffic of 5% and 7.5% respectively have been assumed. These imply about
5.25 million tons of freight and 6.25 million passengers carried by 1980.
42.       An economic evaluation of the project was undertaken on the basis
of two typical cases of actual ship acquisition plans submitted to DBP by
shipowners. The first case is the introduction of a modern, second-hand,
5000 GRT roll-on roll-off type ship on the main Manila-Cebu route replacing
a number of conventional passenger/cargo vessels. This yields an economic
rate of return of about 30% with a 25 year project life. The second case is
the replacement of 25 year old combined passenger/cargo ships by modern,
second-hand 1200 Dwt passenger/cargo ships which yields an economic rate
of return of about 27%. Both cases result in upgrading inter-island shipping
operations and enable simultaneous scrapping of old and less suitable World
War II surplus ships, which have been a serious safety hazard. They both
result in a reduction of about 15% in the economic cost of traffic carried.
More generally, the improvement of inter-island shipping would result in
more efficient transport of domestic production and would enhance the con-
tinued overall economic development of the Philippines.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
43.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of the Philippines
and the Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III,
Section 4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and the text of a



- 13 -
draft resolution approving the proposed loan are being distributed separately
to the Executive Directors. The agreements referred to in Part IV - the
Project - are set forth in sections 3.05, 3.06 and 3.08 of the Loan Agreement.
The Loan would not become effective until a Subsidiary Loan Agreement was
concluded between the Government and DBP.
44.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
45.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C.   Projects in Execution
Ln. No. 637-Pli      Irrigation; US$34.0 million Loan of August 18, 1969;
Closing Date: June 30, 1976
This is the first major irrigation project in the Philippines
and will supply water year-round to nearly 77,000 hectares. The proj-
ect's on-farm development scheme is setting a pattern for future irriga-
tion development in the country. Some delays were caused by the 1972
floods but the dam was commissioned on September 7, 1974 ahead of sched-
ule. All work is expected to be completed and the loan fully disbursed
by June 30, 1976, the original completion date. Project costs have
increased 34 percent over appraisal estimates largely due to inflation,
devaluation of the peso and design changes in the dam. However, as a
result of close coordination established between irrigation and agricul-
tural supporting services, the project is expected to reach full devel-
opment in 7 years after completion of construction instead of 13 years
as appraised. The project remains economically viable.
Ln. No. 720-PH      Rice Processing and Storage; US$14.3 million Loan of
February 4, 1974; Closing Date: June 30, 1975
This project provides long-term credit through the Development
Bank of the Philippines to finance a program for the development and mod-
ernization of the private sector of the rice processing industry. It
included six large integrated processing plants to produce the high qual-
ity rice required for the anticipated exportable surplus, which did not
materialize owing to setbacks in rice production. The President's memo-
randum to the Executive Directors dated June 8, 1972 (R72-40) proposed
amendments to the loan agreement to shift the emphasis to rehabilitation
of existing facilities and to streamline procurement procedures. In spite
of this the project has made very little progress and by the end of Feb-
ruary 1974, only US$0.5 million had been disbursed. During the critical
shortage of rice last year the Government successfully encouraged an in-
crease in maize production, and the consumption of maize mixed with rice.
This has led to a demand for maize processing, storage and handling facil-
ities, and Government has proposed the project be expanded to include grains
other than rice. Much of the new demand will come from public entities and
small individuals, so that Government has proposed they also be included,

the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken
to remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the
understanding that they do not purport to present a balanced eval-
uation of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

and that the minimum size of sub-loan be reduced to cover the smaller pro-
cessors. These amendments, designed to widen the project's objectives, to
cover the changed conditions and to facilitate speedy and full implementa-
tion, were presented to the Executive Directors in the President's Memorandum
dated April 15, 1974 (Sec M74-244). The Executive Directors approved the
proposals and the Loan Agreement has been amended accordingly. A forth-
coming supervision mission should be able to assess the results of the
amendment.
Ln. No. 731-PH       Highway; US$8.0 million Loan of April 14, 1971;
Closing Date: May 15, 1975
The project for the construction and improvement of the Cotabato-
Digos road (160 km) in Mindanao is now behind schedule, because of civil
disturbances in the Cotabato area, exceptional rains and rapidly escalating
prices. Completion is now expected in the last quarter of 1975. Hlowever,
all principal problems have been identified and work on resolving them is
progressing satisfactorily. The project also includes two components fi-
nanced by UNDP: technical assistance to the Bureau of Public Highways (BPH)
for operational improvements and feasibility studies for future highway
projects. Work on the technical assistance component is progressing well
and the feasibility studies have been completed.
Ln. No. 809-PH and Fifth Power; US$22.0 million and US$10.0 million Loan
Cr. No. 296-PH       and Credit of April 3, 1972; Closing Date:   June 30, 1978
The project is helping the National Power Corporation (NPC) to
finance the construction of a second thermal unit of 150-MW at Bataan and
transmission facilities in Luzon. The project is behind schedule because
procurement has taken longer than expected. The Closing Date has been
postponed to June 30, 1978 to allow time for delayed procurement and
because retention monies will not be paid to the major equipment supplier
until at least one year after the plant is commissioned. NPC's financial
situation has been improved by the imposition in July 1973 of a surcharge
to cover increased fuel costs. A further tariff increase was approved, ef-
fective July 1, 1974 and this should enable NPC to achieve its covenanted
rate of return in FY 74/75.
Ln. No. 823-PH       Livestock; US$7.5 million Loan of May 25, 1972;
Closing Date: December 31, 1978
The project is assisting Government in carrying out its live-
stock development program through credit supervised by the Development
Bank of the Philippines. The project is progressing satisfactorily.

education, planning, management and cui Lculum development, science
teacher training, and training of technicians, skilled craftsmen and
farmers. Although no disbursements have been made, the project is
progressing on schedule.
Ln. No. 891-PH       Fisheries; US$11.6 million Loan of May 21, 1973;
Closing Date: June 30 1979
This project is designed to provide long term credit to the
private sector through the Development Bank of the Philippines for
marine and inland fisheries development. The loan became effective
on December 5, 1973. The demand for loans appears adequate and the
organization to implement them has been properly established. The
project is progressing satisfactorily.
Ln. Nio. 939-Pil     Second Ports; US$6.1 million Loan of October 24, 1973;
Closing Date: December 31, 1977
This project provides for the rehabilitation and expansion
of the ports of General Santos and Cagayan de Oro in the island of
Mindanao. Detailed designs for both ports are now complete and con-
tract documents have been forwarded to the Bank for review. The
project is progressing satisfactorily.
Ln. No. 950-PIl      Second Hlighway; US$68.0 million Loan of December 12, 1973;
Closing Date: December 31, 1977
The project is helping the Government to implement its program of
construction, improvement and rehabilitation of highways and feeder roads.
Work has begun on twelve of the fourteen contracts and will begin on the
remainder shortly.   In line with world-wide inflation, costs have increased
sharply and the estimated completion cost has risen by 60%, reflecting the
increased cost of fuel and basic construction materials. Several proposals
to assist offsetting some of the additional cost are under consideration.
The UNDP financed Road Feasibility Studies (Phiase II), for which the Bank
is Executing Agency, are progressing satisfactorily and a possible Third
HSighway project has already been identified. Execution of other minor proj-
ect items is proceeding generally on schedule.

of the Philippines (DBP). The industrial portion of the loan (US$48 mil-
lion) will be used by DBP to make sub-loans to finance direct imports for
medium and relatively large industrial projects. DBP will use the balance
(US$2 million) to finance about 1,300 smallholders in a pilot tree-farming
project. The Loan Agreement was signed on June 12, 1974. The loan be-
came effective on September 9, 1974. It is progressing satisfactorily.
Ln. No. 1010-PH     Third Rural Credit; US$22.0 million; Loan of June 17, 1974;
Closing Date: December 31, 1977
The Central Bank will relend the proceeds of the Loan (except for
a small amount for evaluation study) to participating banks. These will re-
lend to farmers and rural entrepreneurs to finance investment in farm mech-
anisation, on-farm transportation, farm support facilities and equipment,
coastal and inland fisheries, small-scale livestock development and cottage-
scale agro-industry. It also provides for a review by local experts of the
first, second and third rural credit projects. The Loan Agreement was signed
on June 17, 1974. The loan became effective on August 27, 1974. It is pro-
gressing satisfactorily.

PHILIPPINES
INTER-ISLAND SHIPPING PROJECT
LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:                 The Republic of the Philippines.
Beneficiary:              Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP).
Amount:                   US$20.0 million equivalent.
Terms:                    The loan would be for a term of 18 years, including
a grace period of 4 years and at an interest rate
of 8% per annum.
Relending Terms:          The loan would be relent by DBP for terms of (i)
up to 16 years, including two years grace for
new ships; (ii) between 8 and 12 years, including
6 months grace for used ships; and (iii) up to
5 years, including one year grace for conversions
and major repairs. The relending interest rate
would be 12% in all cases.
Project Description:      The Loan would be used by DBP to make sub-loans to
finance the acquisition of new and used ships and
conversion and repairs of existing ships of the
inter-island fleet. It would also provide tech-
nical assistance to the Maritime Industry Author-
ity (MIA) and DBP if bilateral aid is not forth-
coming.
Estimated Cost:                     Local     Foreign      Total
(US$ million)
New and Used Ships              0.8        29.2        30.0
Repairs and Conversions         1.2         1.8         3.0
Technical Assistance            0.1         0.7        0.8

ANNEX III
Page 2
Financing Plan:           The Bank loan would finance 59% of the total
project costs (i.e., 63% of the total foreign
exchange cost), and shipowners and DBP would
finance the balance (about $14.1 million
equivalent).
Procurement:             New ships would be procured on the basis of
international competitive bidding, in accord-
ance with the Bank's guidelines. A 15% do-
mestic preference would be used in bid evalu-
ation or the customs duty, if lower. Used
ships would be procured after DBP has secured
several quotations from international ship-
brokers which will be reviewed by qualified
marine surveyors. Repairs would be carried
out according to the technical standards of
an international classification society or
to other Bank approved marine inspection
services. Major repairs and conversions do
not lend themselves to international competi-
tive bidding. They would be carried out in
accordance with normal commercial practices.
Consultants:              (i) A maritime financial adviser and a naval
architect/technical adviser to assist the Mari-
time Section of the Industrial Department in
DBP; (ii) Marine surveyor experts to assist
the marine inspection service conducted by
the Philippine Coast Guard, assisted by MIA.
Rate of Return:           The economic rate of return would be determined
for each sub-project. The estimated economic
rate of return from replacing an obsolete ship
by a new ship of 1200 deadweight tons (dwt) is
27%.
Appraisal Report:         Appraisal Report No. 437a-PH, dated
September 26, 1974.
