MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA
FOR AN ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
1.         I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation for a proposed
development credit to the Federal Republic of Nigeria (the Government) for SDR 14.7 million
(US$20.0 million equivalent) to help finance a project for supporting Nigeria's structural
adjustment program through improved management, revenue mobilization and policy formation.
The proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms with 35 years maturity, including a ten-year
grace period. The project is expected to be cofinanced by the United Nations Development
Program (UNDP).
2.          Backgrmnd: The Government of Nigeria has, over the past five years, been
carrying out a structural adjustment program (SAP), which combined exchange rate and trade
policy reforms with stabilization policies designed to restore balance of payments equilibrium and
price stability. Emphasis was placed on downsizing the parastatal sector and improving the
efficiency of those assets remaining in the public sector. The World Bank supported the program
with a US$452 million Trade Policy and Export Development Loan. A second policy-based loan,
the US$500 million Trade and Investment Policy Loan, was approved by the Bank in December
1988. Actions taken under the SAP included the introduction of a foreign exchange auction
system and, later, the introduction of a dual exchange rate system consisting of bureaux de change
operating at parallel market rates. Import licensing was abolished and some import prohibitions
were replaced with tariffs. Revenues were enhanced by improvements in import duty assessment
and collection. Non-oil exports were encouraged through a variety of programs including the
right to retain all foreign exchange earning in domiciliary accounts. Over 70 public enterprises
were privatized and about 35 major parastatals including utilities are being commercialized.
Agricultural marketing boards were abolished and most price control have been lifted. The
banking system has been substantially deregulated. A technical assistance project (TAP) (No.
2480-UNI) was explicitly used as a flexible means of financing measures designed to strengthen
revenue and expenditure control functions and debt management systems associated with the
Government's adjustment program. This project has made useful progress in strengthening the
statistical services and debt systems, but has moved very slowly in the other components.
3.          Many commendable actions were taken under the SAP but there have been some
slippages and continued reforms will be required. The key areas of concern include the lack of
fiscal stability during most of the SAP period, ineffective public sector management, and neglect
for the adequate delivary of social services. Attempts at improving planning and expenditure
control mechanisms have had little impact. Further progress needs to be made in improving
operations supportive of the adjustment process, especially in key financial operations such as
revenue collection, expenditure controls, budget processes, including better review and monitoring
of capital expenditures. Improvements are also required in the management and implementation
of monetary policy including open market operations. Progress needs to be made in financial
sector operations including the closure or restructuring of problem banks and improvements in
external debt management. A strong effort has been made at privatizing and commercializing
some public enterprises. Although this effort appeared to have stalled for a while, there are recent
signs of the program being restored. The Government recognizes that continued attention needs
to be paid to continue the implementation of the privatization and commercialization process



-2-
currently being  carried  out under the Technic.  Committee  for Privatization  and
Commercialization (TCPC). The Ministry of Finance a irporated (MOFI) is vested with the
power to act as portfolio manager for public enterprises. MOFI also makes available funding to
parastatals and collects dividends on behalf of the Government. The Government is taking steps
to establish as a new agency, the Utilities Charges Commission (UCC), to recommend rates for
utilities. The Federal Republic of Nigeria has specifically sought assistance from the Bank in
supporting the government's activities through the on-going transition to civilian rule.
Proect Objecime
4.                A major objective of the BAek's program of assistance to Nigeria Is to
support the establishment of a policy, incentive and instiutional framework designed to promote
an efficient supply response from the public as well as the private sector, while easing the foreign
exchange constraint. The objectives of the present project are to provide support to the key
agencies involved in implementing the Government's Structural Adjustment Program, and assist
in creating an environment to facilitate more sound management of the economy. The project
aims to improve tbe Government's ability to carry out its public finance functions, including better
revenue collectior.. and expenditure control. It also aims to provide support for the Government's
efforts at initiating reforms in the financial sector and in forging ahead with privatization and
commercialization of its parastatal operations to make them more viable and financially sound
enterprises.
Project Description
5.          The proposed Project would support the Government's efforts in the areas of fiscal
management and privatization and commercialization. In order to respond to the Government's
needs during and after transiton, the project will also include an institutional support and studies
component to provide assistance to key agencies involved in implementing the Structural
Adjustment Program, as these agencies define their needs and develop their programs. In
designing the program, the Bank and the Government were able to draw upon the extensive
dialogue that had been carried on over the past three years in these specific areas:
(a)   FiscManl gmnt. Assistance will be provided to departments under the
Federal Ministry of Finance to improve the budgetary process, in revenue
collection and expenditure controls, national accounting operations and tax
policies. Training in financial management and information systems will
also be provided at State and Local Government levels.
(b)   Privatization and Commercialization Coong . Support will be provided
to facilitate the implementation of public enterprise reforms through
assistance to the Technical Committee for Privatization and
Commercialization (TCPC), to the Ministry of Finance Incorporated
(MOFI) or to any other agency, to be determined by the Government, as
being the agency to continue to carry out the oversight of parastatals as they
are commercialized and privatized. Assistance will also be provided to the
Utility Charges Commision (UCC), the regulatory body for utility tariffs,
and to parastatal agencies to assist in implementing their transition to
private/commercialized entities.



-3 -
(c)   Institutional Sport and Studies. Some agencies directly involved in
implementing the Government's Structural Adjustment Program, have not
yet fully defined their needs or developed their program. This component
will provide funds to these agencies as they develop their programs within
the overall objectives of the project, in areas such as public expenditure
control, financial sector management, civil service reform, poverty
alleviation, and gender aspects.
6.                Projet Cost and Financing. The total project cost is estimated at US$27.0
million and the IDA credit will finance 76 percent (excluding duties and taxes) of the total cost.
IDA financing will be made available to the participating agencies by the Government on a grant
basis. Retroactive financing of up to US$1.0 million is contemplated for payments made for
expenditures incurred after June 30, 1992. This has been introduced with the objective of
avoiding a gap between the closure of the TAP scheduled for December 31, 1992 and the
effectiveness of this project also scheduled for December 3t, 1992. UNDP have expressed
interest in principle in co-financing the Project, with particular interest in training-related activities
of State and Local Government employees. In the event that co-financing does not materialize in,
sufficient quantities to finance the program fully, IDA financing will be made available to those
agencies that are ready for project implementation soonest. IDA and the co-financiers will finance
all of the foreign exchange costs, amounting to US$18.20 million equivalent, and local costs
amounting to US$2.80 million. The remaining US$6.00 million equivalent in local costs will be
provided by the Government. In addition, the Goverment will provide the cost of local staff,
offices, local recurrent costs and additional incremental staff and office facilities, excluding the
cost of local consultants. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A.
Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursement and the Disbursement Schedule are shown
in Schedu!e B. A timetable of key project processing events and status of Bank Group operations
are given In Schedules C and D, respectively. A Technical Annex is also included outlining
details of the proposed Project components, a Summary of Studies (Schedule 1), Training Program
(Schedule 2), Matrix of Key Project Activities (Schedule 3), Organizational Chart for the Federal
Ministry of Finance (Schedule 4), Supervision Plan (Schedule 5), Assessment of Technical
Assistance Project (Loan No. 2480-UNI), Lessons Learned from the Nigeria Technical Assistance
Project and How Difficulties Encountered are Addressed in the Design of the Proposed Project
(Schedule 6), Project Management and Implementation Arrangements (Schedule 7), Project
Implementation Charts (Schedule 8) and Documents in Project File (Schedule 9).
7.          Environmental Imp. The project objectives and implementation aspects will not
have any direct impact on environmental concerns. The operation is rated as a Category C
project. Indirect benefits will be derived in the longer-term through improved data availability
needed for decision making.
8.          Proect Iementation. The Project will be administered by each participating
agency on a decentralized basis. The procedure for submission of withdrawal applications to IDA
would be the responsibility of each participating agency. This procedure will also apply to
agencies within the Federal Ministry of Finance. The Multilateral Department of FMF will
appoint a Project Officer who will be responsible for securing project accounts from the
participating agencies, arranging for audits, and for assuring that all participating agencies are
fully aware of World Bank guidelines for procurement and auditing procedures. There will also
be an Accounting Officer, a Procurement Specialist and a Senior Systems Analyst who will assist
the participating agencies in project implementation. A project launch workshop will be held soon



-4 -
after the project is presented to the Board to ensure timely project start up. The project will be
implemented over a four-year period after credit effectiveness.
9.          Eject Susainabil1y. Part, f the Project is concerned with converting Government
manual systems of fiscal and financial sector management to computerized systems. Once
converted, it is unlikely that the new systems would revert to manual operations, based on
experience in other countries. The sustainability of the project depends largely on the training and
consultancy services provided under the project for manpower development in the participating
agencies. The policy studies component would, of course, only be. sustained to the extent that
they lead to policy-related reforms.
10.         Previous Bank Experience. The past performance of technical assistance projects
in Nigeria has been far from satisfactory. Disbursements have been inordinately slow. A review
of the performance of recent TA projects (including the TAP) indicates that the reasons for poor
performance include frequent turn-over of personnel, complexity of project design, reluctance on
the part of some agencies to utilize Bank loans as opposed to grant funds for technical assistance,
lack of familiarity with Bank procurement procedures, centralized project management and
implementation arrangements requiring lengthy clearance procedures and delays in securing Bank
clearance of procurement documents. Not all of these factors can be avoided, due to the complex
structure of the Government and the wide range of agencies involved in the adjustment process.
The Project's design, however, takes into consideration many of the problems encountered in the
past. For example, the proposed credit will be administered on a decentralized basis in order to
reduce delays caused by excessive clearances, and 12-monthly reviews will be carried out, where
lagging components will be reviewed and their funding reallocated as needed. Further, the TAP
has provided detailed preparatory work in respect of the computerization components and has
made many of the participating agencies fully conversant with Bank procedures relating to
procurement and disbursement, thus setting the stage for better future performance. The proposed
credit serves as a suitable vehicle to continue implementation of components fully developed under
the previous TA project. US$5.5 million of undisbursed IBRD Loan funds under the TAP was
canceled with effect from March 31, 1992, leaving sufficient funds to implement those activities
for which commitments had already been made. Finally, the Project provides support in the areas
oi procurement, audit preparation, specialized assistance in information systems as well as
significant inputs from IDA staff during supervision of the proposed project and in the course of
carrying out dialogue with these agencies in carrying out economic and sector work. All of these
measures taken together, should improve project implementation.
11.         Rationale for IDA Support: Assistance to the Government in carrying out its
adjustment program on a more efficient and effective basis is a key objective of the Bank's overall
development strategy for Nigeria. The Bank is particularly well suited to play a catalytic role in
providing assistance to these agencies as they prepare for transition to civilian rule and in their
efforts at modernizing their operations.
12.         Agrd Actions: Conditions of effectiveness, which are expected to ensure that the
Project gets underway promptly, will include the appointment of a Project Officer, a Procurement
Specialist, a Systems Analyst and an Accounting Officer in the Multilateral Department of the
Federal Ministry of Finance. This core group will provide advice and assistance to all
participating agencies under the Project. The Federal Ministry of Finance will issue a circular to
each participating agency, outlining operational procedures for project implementation, before
effectiveness of the Project. A draft of this circular has already been reviewed by IDA. The
detailed work plans prepared for each agency will be reviewed and updated during 12-monthly



-  -
reviews where funds will be reallocated, depending on progress achieved in implementation. In
order to ensure timely progress in implementation, detailed implementation plans with
performance indicators for each of the participating agencies have been prepared and terms of
reference for carrying out the studies were agreed upon during negotiations. During the Annual
Reviews, the detailed work plans will be reviewed in relation to program achieved and
performance indicators assessed. Training needs and progress achieved according to the training
plans for each participating agency, wiUl also be assessed, as well 3s progress on proposed studies
in terms of anticipated targets for completion and implementation of the findings of these studies.
Disbursements will depend upon IDA being satisfied with progress achieved by each participating
agency. Prior to undertaking any training for subsequent years, participating agencies would
submit, for review by IDA, a statement of training accomplished during the previous year.
Quarterly Reports will be sent directly to IDA by each participating agency, with copy to the
Project Officer situated in the Federal Ministry of Finance.
13.         Program  Objective Cate=ories:  The Project is directly supportive of the
Government's structural adjustment program. It also includes a substantial amount of institution
and capacity building through provision of training, consultant services and support for
implementation of the ongoing commercialization and privatization program. The Project will also
anayze poverty and gender-related issues.
14.         Project Benefits. The benefits of the Project are expected to enhance capacity in
the Government to implement the Government's Structural Adjustment Program and make policy
decisions based on more comprehensive and timely analysis of policy issues, especially in the
areas of fiscal policy, revenue mobilization and expenditt - e control. The project will assist in
improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the Government's fiscal and financial management
processes and in implementing the privatization and commercialization program. In addition, the
studies on poverty alleviation and gender-related issues will yield an information base which will
assist in addressing social issues in policy formulation.
15.         Proect Risks.  There is general recognition of the need to strengthen the
Government's capacity to manage fiscal and monetary policies and address structural issues.
However, there is a risk that the transition to civilian rule may lead to personnel changes which
may affect. timely project implementation. The project design has attempted to reduce this risk
by providing for decentralized management, detailed implementation plans and monitoring
mechanisms.
16.         Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors approve
the proposed credit.

FEDERAL REPUBIIQ!Z NIGERIA
PRQPOSED ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCEPRJC
A. DETAILED PROJECT DESCRlIION
Ineitbdoal Frameor
The institutional structure of the Federal agencies responsible for fiscal policy,
revenue mobilization and resource allocation as well as those agencies having responsibility for macro-
economic planning and the Government's commercialization and privatization programs have recently
undergone comprehensive changes. More changes are expected in the area of commercialization and
privatization with a new agency, the proposed Bureau for Public Enterprises taking the place of the
existing Technical Committee on Privatization and Commercialization. The institutional framework
as related to the project activities is outlined below:
(a)   lhe Federal Miniya of Finance (FMF1, under the Federal Minister of Finance,
has five major offices or semi-independent organizations reporting to it:
(i)    ffice of Budg, headed by a Director-General, performs the following
functions: a) preparation of the Federal Government budget; b)
monitoring of Government revenue inflows from oil and non-oil sources;
c) initiating additional sources of revenue; d) carrying out analysis and
reconciliation of revenue receipts; e) coordination of the activities of the
Tariff Review Board (CRB); f) coordination of the Import Duty
Monitoring Committee; g) monitoring tariff concessions; h) maintaining
quarterly appraisals of budget performance; i) releasing and transferring
of funds through warrants; and j) monitoring budgetary releases. These
functions are carried out under the Departments of Expenditure,
Revenue, and Planning, Research and Statistics.
(ii)   Qfflce of Finance headed by a Director General, has five major
departments, including: (a) Trade and Exchange Department, responsible
for foreign exchange control functions; (b) Home Finmance Department,

(iv) Office of the Accountant General, headed by the Accountant General,
responsible for Government expenditures through its subsidiary, the
Federal Treasury, as well as management of Government investments,
cash management, revenue accounting, and preparation of the
Government's annual accounts.
(v)   Cusm  Qffl_ has responsibility for managing the flow of imports and
exports and the collection of tariffs and export duties.
(b)   The Revenue Mobilization Commission, in the Office of the President, has
responsibility for (i) monitoring revenue collections as a basis for designing new
revenue collection devices or modifying existing ones; (ii) reviewing from time-
to-time revenue allocation formulae and principles in operation, to ensure tha
they conform to changing realities and suggesting improved revenue collection
systems to Federal, State and local Governments; and (iii) recommending
equitable policies for the sharing of public revenues from all sources between the
various levels of Government. It also determines the remuneration for political
office holders such as members of executive and legislative branches of
government.
(c)   The National Planning Commission (NPC), is located in the Office of the
President and the Chairman of the Commission is the President and the Minister
for special duties is the Vice-Chaihman. The NPC has two Directors General,
one in charge of planning and project monitoring and the other in charge of
economic analysis. The NPC has responsibility of preparing the Rolling Plan
and the Long-Term Perspective Plan for Nigeria. It also contains the residual
functions of the previous Ministry of Budget and Planning. The former
Economic Affairs Office of the President is now merged in the NPC. The
Commission's duties include the development of national economic policies,
analysis and review of Ministerial policies to ensure consistency with national
objectives, and assisting in the development and monitoring of the Government's
capital investment budget.
(d)   Technical Committee for Privatization and Commercialization (TCPC), in the
Office of the President, has the responsibility for recommending to the President
which of the Governments parastatal operations should be sold or closed down,
and for improving the efficiency of those parastatals that the Government
determines should remain in the public sector. 1.ae Commission is scheduled
to terminate its activities by December 31, 1992 and the functions related to
managing the Government's remaining parastatal operations are expected to be
assumed by MOFI described above or yet a new agency to be established.
(e) Ministry of Finance Incorporated (MOED established in 1959, has been vested
with the power to manage Government interests in public enterprises. MOFI
has a record of government involvement in all of the parastal agencies, makes
loans available to parastatals and collects dividends on behalf of the
Government. MOFI acts as a portfolio manager for public enterprises. Further,



- 16 -                         Technia ARM
Page 3 of 10
MOFI has the mandate to assist parastatals as they implement their transition to
private/commercialized enterprises.
(f)   The Utility Charues Commission, in the Office of the President and chaLed by
the Minister for Power and Mines, is being established to recommend on rates
for electricity supply, water supply, telecommunications and other utilities. Its
governing legislation is now with the Ministry of Justice for legal review. The
Director General of the Commission has been appointed, and it is developing its
work program and staffing complement.
(g)   State and Local Governments have responsibility for planning and policy
formulation in the different sectors, public expenditure allocation and
development of public investment program at the State and Local levels of
Government. They also have responsibility for collecting local licensing fees
and a wide variety of local taxes and charges relating to local activities.
There are at present thirty States as well as the Federal Capital Territory, and
589 Local Government Areas.
Proiccl DescrDd
2.                In designing this project, the Bank and the Government were able to draw upon
the extensive dialogue that had been carried out over the past in the areas of fiscal and financial sector
management, privatization and commercialization and in the areas of addressing social aspects of
adjustment. In providing technical assistance and training, the Bank and the Government were able
to draw upon the experience from the previous Technical Assistance Project (No. 2480-UNI) (TAP)
both with regard to pitfalls and shortcomings, difficulties to be encountered as well as the strengths
and positive outcomes relating to the said project. The experience under the TAP and lessons learned
are outlined in detail in Schedule 6 of this Technical Annex.
3.                The TAP has been used by the Government as a means of fmancing measures
designed to strengthen revenue and expenditure control functions and debt management systems
associated with the Government's adjustment program. While the performance of this project has not
been very satisfactory due to its slow rate of utilization, the TAP, which is scheduled to close on
December 31, 1992, has nevertheless been useful in defining some of the additional needs for
improving the Government's fiscal management and in identifying some of the costs of doing so. It
has also been useful in carrying out much of the preparatory work, especially in carrying out needs
assessments for the various agencies and in preparing comprehensive implementation plans for
computeization programs. The proposed credit provides a valuable vehicle for completing some of
the activities commenced under the TAP as well as for implementing some of the programs which are
ready for implementation.
4.                As far as the computerization components of the project are concerned, the
project will focus on computerizing only those programs in agencies where deiled needs asessments
have been carried out and system design specifications completed. Implementation of these systems
would as far as possible be contracted to one company (especially in implementing programs of
different agencies under one ministry). The company/companies would be selected on the basis of
international competitive bidding among pre-ualified firms and they will be in charge of implemendng
the entire system including procuring of hardware and software, training, providing back-up support



- 17 -                          Technica AM"
Page 4 of 10
and maintenance. As far as the other agencies are concerned, the project will finance the carrying out
of detailed needs assessments, adequate specification of systems and preparation of detailed
implementation plans. If these plans are completed, the project contains sufficient flexibility especially
under the Institutional Support and Studies component to finance procurement of specific items in
accordance with the findings of the assessments. For certain other agencies, the project will only
finance procurement of office equipment and supplies to facilitate the implementation of their
respective projects and programs.
5.                The requirements for meeting the objectives of this new Project are grouped
under functional categories related to the Project's objectives and under the organizational units
responsible for the related funtons as follows:
A.          Fiscal Management (US$18.36 million)
6.                Several Government ministries and many departments and offices at the Federal,
State and local levels are involved in fiscal management, as elaborated in the institutional arrangements
section. Assistance will be provided to the following key institutions involved in this function:
(a)   Federal Ministry of Finance (US$11.98 million)
(i)   Office of the Budget will receive support to assist in the design of a
modified VAT for introduction in 1994 and training of Budget Office
staff to prepare for its implementation. The Office of the Budget will
also receive assistance to carry out a tariff study to review the present
tariff structure and options for modification when present legislation
expires in 1994. The project will also finance a needs assessment to
determine the requirements to place the operations of the office on a
computerized basis and training will be provided, possibly overseas for
key staff in modern budget and financial management techniques.
(ii)   Federal Board of lanl Revenue (FBIR) will receive assistance in
converting the present manually operated revenue collecdon process to
a computerized system. Detailed preparatory work has been completed
in FBIR under the TAP, including specification of systems and
preparation of comprehensive implementation plans and tender
documents. Support under this project will include hardware, software,
and consultant services to assist in procuring and installing the new
system at the Board's headquarters, in training personnel to operate the
system, as well as a trial installation of six area offices in Lagos to serve
as a model for fiture extension of the program network to the rest of the
country. Studies and management audits carried out for FBIR under the
TAP have confirmed that computerization of the Board's operations
should lead to improved revenue collections that will far exceed the cost
of installation.
(iii)  Office of the Accountant General, through its Federal Treasury, will
receive assistance in expanding a pilot mini-computer system
Implemented under the TAP for revenue collection and expenditure



- 18 -                         TechnicW   A
Page 5 of 10
accounting, and payroll controls. Substantial preparatory work has been
carried out under TAP in identfying specific systems needed including
traiinig required. In accordance with the needs identified, the project
will finance computer hardware, communications equipment and
consultant services to prepare for the expansion of the pilot program to
a country-wide network, as well as the training of staff to operate the
system.
(iv)  The MUltilateral Institutions. Research. Planning and Statistics and
External Finance Deparunents. The Multilateral Institutions Department
will receive assistance under the project to appoint a Project Officer, a
Procurement Specialist, an Accounting Officer and a Systems Analyst,
who would provide support and assistance to participating agencies under
the project. Their roles are described in paragraph 16 and in Schedule
8 of the Technical Annex. The Research, Planning and Statistics
Department will receive assistance in financing special costs associated
with establishing a computer center. The External Finance Department
will receive assistance for training of staff in debt management
techniques and to carry out a study on debt restructuring options.
(b)   National Revenug Mobilization Commission (US$1.07 million). Assistance to
the Commission will include training for top level management in public policy
and finance; fiscal policy and management service and data processing
applications and techniques; computer equipment for forecasting and analyzing
trends in revenue collection establishing linkage to the information systems of
the Federal Ministry of Finance; and vehicles to liaise between the
Commission's six zonal offices and the central headquarters. Assistance will
also be provided for policy studies in the design of tax systems and revenue
collection techniques at the Federal as well as State and Local Government
levels.
(c)   National Planning Commission (US$1.42 million)
(i)   Department of Macro-Economic Planinj will receive assistance for
studies to assess the impact of economic policy measures using
quantitative analytical tools. The studies will include novel approaches
to economic policy and development planning, computer applications in
national economic management, forecasting and simulations and an
assessment of regional patterns of income levels and economic activity.
The project will also assist in updating econometric models and in
carrying out an assessment of current practices of project appraisal,
criteria for selection and monitoring of existing capital projects. A needs
assessment wiUl be carried out of the cost of computerization of the
commission's budgeting and monitoring system for the management of
the capital expenditure budget.
(d)   Office of the Vice President and State and Local Governments flS$3.89
millin). Nigeria's federal system requires linkages between local, State and



- 19 -                         Tchnc  Annex
Page C of 10
Federal offices concerned with fiscal management. In addition to specific
training provided in connection with certain aspects of the national networks to
be implemented under the project, there is a need for further training in fiscal
management at both State and local levels. Most of this training can be carried
out in Nigeria. Consultant services will be provided for the State and Local
Government Liaison Office in the Office of the Vice President to organize
relevant courses at appropriate Nigerian training institutions, including the
Administrative Staff College of Nigeria (ASCON), and for these institutions to
train trainers abroad in specialized areas of expertise where necessary. Support
will be provided to ASCON for the preparation of financial, budgeting, auditing
and economic training programs for officials of State and Local government
authorities. Funding will also be provided under this component for the State
and Local Government documentation center at ASCON, which has already been
approved by the Vice President. Local training under the project is planned for
two persons in each of the 589 Local Government Areas and ten persons for
each of the 30 State Governments and the Federal Capital Territory.
B.   Privatization and Commercialization (US$3.04 million)
7.                Nigeria's severely constrained budgetary circumstances underline the importance
of formulating provisions for restructuring and closing unviable operations and opening up greater
opportunities for private capital. In this context, the Government, through the Technical Committee
for Privatization and Commercialization (TCPC), formulated an action program to initiate closure
procedures for unviable enterprises and privatization and commercialization procedures for many other
parastatals. Under the proposed project, provision will be made to support further implementation of
the restructuring program by including funds for the successor agency to the TCPC, MOFI, or any
other agency to be determined by the Government to provide technical assistance to targeted
enterprises. In addition the Project will assist in determining social costs associated with the
commercialization and/or closure of unviable enterprises and will develop options and measures for
compensation of retrenched labor and alleviation of social costs. The Project will also provide direct
assistance to major parastals to implement the transition process and to the Utilities Charges
Commission to develop their program in setting tariff structures.
(a)   MOFETCP  (US$1.97 million). TCPC has carried out its privatization and
commercialization operations with little or no outside assistance to date, and
believes that none will be needed to conclude its work which comes to a close
on December 31, 1992. Assistance is included in the project for MOFI, which
currently acts as portfolio manager for public enterprises and may also be given
responsibilities for oversight of parastatal agencies including the preparation of
corporate plans and performance contracts for these agencies after TCPC ceases
to exist. Funds are being provided for training, office equipment, vehicles and
supplies and for consultant services to assist the modernization of parstatal
operations. Funds will be made available to assist some of the major parastatal
organizations, as and when the need arises in implementing their
commercialization programs. Assistance will be provided, pardicularly in
restructuring and strengthening the technical, financial, operational and human
resource development programs of these parastatals. These and related functions



- 20 -                         Technica AgM
Page 7 of 10
will be financed under this budget category for specific purposes and
organizazions to be agreed to during project implementation.
Specific criteria will be considered in determining the eligibility of parastatals
for assistance under this component. The criteria will include: (i) identification
of parastatas being considered as being of high priority for commercialization
and privatization, in accordance with the list specified by TCPC; (ii)
identification of agencies deemed to require assistance urgently; and (iii)
emphasis to be placed on privatization. In implementing this component, the
decentralized mode would be emphasized and each participating state enterprise
would handle the implementation of their respective programs.
(b)   Uties Charges Comission (US$1.07 million).  The Utilities Charges
Commission requires financial support for the development of its work program,
methodologies and procedures, for the acquisition of computer hardware and
software, and to undertake an electricity tariff study. Funds will be used to
contract for approximately two person-years' worth of local consultancy for the
work program, methodologies and procedures, the importation of computer
materials, and the contracting externally of expertise to work with UCC on the
tariff study.
C.   Institutional Suport and S_dies   $3.82 mill
8.                Several agencies directly involved in implementing the Government's Structural
Adjustment Program have not yet defined their needs nor developed their programs in sufficient detail.
In order to retain some flexibility to respond to the Government's needs and assist these agencies in
implemnenting their programs as they are developed, this component has been included into the project.
Under this component, funds will be provided to assist agencies in areas such as public expenditure
control, financial sector management, civil service reforms, poverty alleviation and gender aspects.
This component will finance studies on gender issues including surveys for gathering gender
disaggregated data, programs to assist lower income groups and social costs associated wkh the
adjustment process. In order to qualify for funds under this component, prospective agencies will need
to submit detailed project components, training requirements, cost estimates and detailed
implementation schedules with performance indicators, to the satisfaction of IDA.
D.   Contingencies IIS$1.78 million)
9.                An amount of US$1.78 million has been included in the Project's budget for
price contingencies, based on projected rates of inflation for the life of the project.
Total Proje ctosts
10.               The total Project cost is estimated at US$27.0 million (see Schedule A attached),
including duties and taxes and US$1.78 million to cover price contingencies. The Government will
finance local costs including ongoing costs of staff salaries, offices and local maintenance as well as
the cost of any expanded office space needed to accommodate the equipment financed under the
Project.
11.               The IDA credit of US$20.0 million equivalent will finance 76 percent of the total
project costs (excluding duties and taxes) and 96 percent of the foreign exchange costs of the Project.



- 21 -                        Teehna Annex
page 8 of 10
IDA and other donors would also finance US$2.80 million of the local costs associated with
procurement of equipment, consultants, technical assistance and training. UNDP has expressed interest
in co-financing the project although no firm commitment has been made as yet.
B. PROJECT ADMINISTRATION AND IMPLEMENAION
12.               Decentralized Project Management. In designing the project, the lessons learned
from past experience of technical assistance in Nigeria (outlined in Schedule 7 of the Technical Annex)
as well as the OED report on technical assistance experience in Sub-Saharan Africa have been
reviewed and taken into consideration. In view of the fact that the centralized structure adopted under
the previous technical assistance project resulted in creating bottlenecks, especily with regard to
obtining clearances and approvals, this project will use a dece.-tralized system of implementation in
order to reduce delays in clearance procedures and speed up implementation. Under this arragement,
authority to implement their programs will rest with each agency so long as the program is
implemented as outlined in the Project documents and falls within the scope of the allocated resources.
Each agency may seek assistance from the core group of experts situated in the Federal Ministry of
Finxace as and when the need arises.
13.               Reallocation Procedure. One obstacle to the implementation of the TAP Loan
was that those agencies moving slowly to implement their components would not release funds for use
by others with clearly identified needs. Therefore, in the case of this Project, in place of a Mid-Term
Review, a review will be held each 12 months after Project effectiveness to determine progress made
in each component. Each agency has prepared and submitted to IDA detailed work plans in respect
of their particular program. At the Annual Review, progress achieved will be assebsed against these
plazs and those components that are seriously behind schedule will be scaled back by agreement
between the Federal Ministry of Finance and IDA, and available funds will be transferred to other
agencies to be utilized in accordance with overall objectives of the Project. During the annual reviews,
progress of training plans that have been prepared for each participating agency will be reviewed and
progress achieved assessed. Progress will be assessed of studies in terms of anticipated targets for
completion and implementation of findings of the studies as agreed between IDA and the Government.
14.               Reallocation will take place upon satisfaction of the following criteria: (1) failure
to submit work plans with specific target dates; (2) extended delays in executing agreed upon
implementation steps; and (3) local currency equivalent has not been provided as anticipated.
15.               Other Project Management Arrangements.  The Multilateral Institutions
Department-of FMF will appoint a member of its staff as Project Officer, who wiU serve as the liaison
between participating agencies and the Bank with respect to Project management, including
procurement and accounting procedures. The Project Officer will ensure that the different federal
ministries, agencies and departments that are the implementing agencies under the project carry out
regular audits in sacordance with applicable guidelines. The Project Officer will be responsible for
assuring that all impiementing agencies are fully aware of the applicable World Bank procurement,
contrctng, disbursement as  auditing procedures. The Project Officer will be assisted in this task
by a qualified Procurement Specialist, who will conduct procurement seminars as necessary to assist
the implementing agencies and ministries in applying these guidelines and in preparing tender
documents and contracts. The Multilateral Department will also appoint an Accounting Officer to
assist the Project Officer in securing the project accounts from each participating agency and for
arranging for audits to be carried out and for adminismering funds made available under the IDA credit



- 22 -                        TechkeaAnn
Page 9 of 10
for the employment of private auditors as necessary to assist the participating agencies to prepare their
accounts. The Multilateral Department will also contract for the services of a qualified Senior Systems
Analyst for two years to assist all of the participating agencies with the establishment of information
systems under the computerization components in the Project.
16.              With respect to training, each participating agency will suI0mit for review by
IDA, a statement of training accomplished during the previous year. This sta.&ent needs to be
submitted before any further training can be undertaken in subsequent years.
17.              Degree of Prearation and Funding for Specific Com2monents. The design of this
project has benefitted from the detailed preparatory work which has been carried out under the
Technical Assistance Project (Loan No. 2480-UNI). The Federal Board of Inland Revenue, the Office
of the Accountant General, have prepared their programs of activities to such a degree that it is
expected that implementation of these components (US$4.2 million) would commence immediately
after the Credit becomes effective. Draft terms of reference for the proposed VAT Study and Tariff
Studies (US$2.0 million) to be carried out by the Office of Budget in FMF were reviewed and agreed
to during negotiations. Some of the training included in the Project is associated with computerization
aspects and may be provided by the firm/firms of consultants handling the computerization elements.
The training of staff of state and LocaL Government Agencies (approximately US$3.0 million) is
expected to be financed by UNDP and the program will be developed according to UNDP's guidelines.
18.              Condiions ofLEffeciveness. Ihe Federal Ministry of Finance will issue a
circular to each participating agency, outlining operational procedures for project implementation. The
draft circular has been reviewed by IDA. The issue of this circular is a condition of effectiveness of
the project. Other conditions of effectiveness, intended to ensure that the project gets underway
promptly include the appointment of the Project Officer, Procurement Specialist, Accounting Officer
and Senior Systens Analyst in the Multilateral Institutions Department of FMF.
19.              Procurement.  (a) Goo. Contracts for the supply of vehicles, office,
computers and other supplies for an amount equivalent to US$100,000 or more shall be procured
through International Competitive Bidding (ICB). The average value of ICB contracts is estimated to
range between US$200,000 and US$500,000. Eligible domestic manufacturers will be enied to a
margin of preference in bid evaluation in conformity with the Bank Guidelines. All contracts for
goods estimated to cost less than US$100,000 equivalent per contract up to an aggregate amount not
to exceed US$2.3 million shall be procured by international and local shopping (minimum of three
quotations preferably, from suppliers eligible under the Guidelines and from at least two countries).
As far as possible, items for procurement will be bulked into packages to permit optimum use of
competitive bidding. (b) Consultant Services and Studies. The services required for consultant and
studies would be procured in accordance with World Bank's Guidelines: "Use of Consultants by World
Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency (Washington, DC., August 1981)". It
is envisaged that a total of 210 person-months of technical assistamce (24 person-months from
individuals and the rest from firms) and 550 person-moinths of consultancy services from firms for 17
studies (see Schedule 1 of the Technical Annex for a summaty of studies-TORs for the studies will
be finalized during negotiations) will be used during the lifetime of the project. All goods contracts
for an amount equivalent to or more than US$100,000 will be subject to the Bank's prior review.
The review process will cover over 70 percent of the total goods' contract value. All service contracts
will also be subject to prior review covering a hundred percent of the total value of such Bank-financed
contracts. It was agreed during negotiations that with regard to goods procured in accordance with



-23-                          ebiaAnx
Page 10 of 10
procedures for International competitive bidding, such goods would not be subjected to preshipment
price verification by a third party.
20.               Disbusement.  To ensure that funds are readily available for prwject
Implementation and to facilitate disbursement, a special account will be established in a local
commercial bank in US dollars, for this project with an initial deposit of US$0.50 million.
Replenishment of the special account by IDA will require the submission of full documentation or
certified statements of expenditures showing that payments were made exclusively for eligible
expenditures. Beneficiaries will submit withdrawal applications directly to IDA for all expenditures
with full documentation or certified statements of expenses. Documentation for contracts valued at
less than US$50,000, for which disbursements would be made against certified statements of
expenditures, would be retained by the implementing agencies for review by the Bank's supervision
missions and project auditors. Whenever possible, withdrawal applications will be aggregated in
amounts of US$50,000 or more for submission to the Bank. A condition of disbursement of funds is
that each participating agency submits to the satisfaction of IDA, updated work plans indicating
detailed aspects of their respective work program.
21.               Each agency will abide by the established procedures for that particular agency
for obtaining approval for procurement. Ihe submission of withdrawal applications would be the
responsibility of each participating agency. This procedure will also apply to agencies within the
Federal Ministry of Finance. Each agency will prepare and submit Quarterly Reports directly to IDA.
They will send copies of the. reports to the Project Officer situated in the FMF. The appointment of
technical staff in FMF to assist the beneficiary agencies with implementation, should ensure that there
is continuity of project administration at the technical level and that documentation is well prepared
for decisions to be made and procedural problems would be eliminated as far as possible. The Federal
Ministry of Finance will issue a circular to all participating agencies outlining operational procedures
for project implementation. The agencies will also be provided with Bank Guidelines with regard to
disbursement and procurement, including standard bidding documents.
Supervision Plan
22.               The project has been planned as a four-year program after credit effectiveness
has been achieved. The timing of project implementation has been scheduled as set forth in the
schedule entitled "Matrix of Key Project Activities" (Schedule 3). There will be a Project Launch
Workshop soon after the Project is presented to the Board. There will also be 12-monthly reviews
during the lifetime of the project as well as a minimum of three supervision missions in the first yean
and a minimum of two supervision missions in subsequent years. Expected resource needs are spelled
out in the attached Supervision Plan (Schedule 5). During the annual reviews, progress in
implementation wiUl be assessed in terms of the implementation charts prepared for each agency
(S&,edule 8). These charts wil be reviewed and agreed to during negotiations.
23.               The project will be completed by December 31, 1996, and the Closing Date for
the Credit will be June 30, 1997.

FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA
ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
SUMMARY OF STUDIES
1.           The studies component in the Federal Ministry of Finance will include the
following:
(a)    Design of a Modified VAT, to be carried out by the Office of the Budget, will
finance consultant services to assist in the introduction of a modified VAT in
1994. This will include the hiring of consultants from counties that have
introduced VATs in circumstances similar to Nigeria's, as well as a study to
determine the hardware and software requirements of computerization of the
system and the design of appropriate training programs and overseas training
of trainers and familiarization visits.
(b)   Tariff Study, to be carried out by the Office of the Budget for consideration of
revised tariff legislation to be adopted in 1994 when the present legislation
expires, will review the present tariff structure, analyze the impact of that
structure on imports, exports and the economy generally, consider the
implications to the economy of possible changes and revisions, and
recommend an optimal tariff structure for the achievement of Nigeria's
development objectives. The study will give particular attention to the impact
of proposed changes on different parts of the Nigerian economy and
population, including the low income and disadvantaged groups.
(c)    Debt Restructuring Options, to be carried out by the External Finance
Department in close collaboration with the Debt Management Unit in the
CBN, will review the world-wide debt restructuring experience of the
developing countries in recent years, including Mexico, Indonesia and other
countries where innovative techniques have been employed. It will analyze
Nigeria's debt structure and lay out options that utilize available possibilities,
indicating the economic and fmancial implications of each.
2.           The National Revenue Mobilization Commission will carry out the following:
(a)    SyatmiofnTaxtio  will be a broad-based survey of all forms of taxation,
their interrelationships in a country context, their advantages and
disadvantages, and possible combinations of tax systems applicable to
Nigeria's sitaion. Ihe study will include consideration of revenue collection
difficulties and their implications in designing an optimal tax system. The
alternative tax systems will be compared to Nigeria's present tax structure,
and comparisons will be drawn regarding relative effectiveness and the impact
on Nigeria's economy of each option.

Page 2 of 3
3.           The Ptivatization and Commercialization component will include financing of
studies related to the Government's desire to put Nigeria's parastatal operations on a more
efficient and financially sound basis through the conversion of parastatal operations through
the expanded use of private contractors or franchises and/or through the conversion of
retained parastatals to a more fully commercial basis. Assistance under the project could
include technical, financial and human resource aspects of operationalizing the reforms
proposed for the Nigerian Electric Power Authority (NEPA), the Nigeria Railway Corporation
(NRC) and the Nigerian Telecommunications Limited (NITEL). The analysis would covsr
various options applicable to each type of operation, advantages and disadvantages of each
option, and the project will support implementation of optimal solutions based on both Nigeria
and worldwide experience.
4.           The Electricity Tariff Study proposed for the Utility Charges Commission
(UCC) will: (i) establish a standard methodology for electricity tariff setting in Nigeria,
(ii) recommend on the structure and level of an economically and financially sound tariff, and
(iii) transfer to UCC staff the concepts and model needed to update tariffs in the future. The
study will be based on long-run marginal cost (LRMC) methodology. While a recent study of
these factors has been completed, it will be necessary to review the extent to which it meets
the requirements for purposes of the tariff study, and will include any indicated additional
work.
5.           The National Planning Commission wilt carry out the following studies:
(a)    Current Practices in Proiect Appraisal. This study will assess the strengths
and weaknesses of, and the remedies to current practices in project appraisal,
criteria for selection, information, requirements and monitoring of existing
capital projects. The terms of reference for the study will include an analysis
of the need for, and recommendations as to the modalities for establishing a
computerized project monitoring system.
(b)    E                  . This study will review the existing econometric
model prepared by NISER in 1987, update and prepare a new model.
(c)   Income Levels and Economic Activity. This study will assess the regional
variations of income levels of different households based on existing data in
relation to economic activities.
6.           Possible studies to be carried oat under the Institutional Support and Studies
Component:
(a)   Impact of World Bank Assistance in Nigeria. This study wiUl review World
Bank assistance since Independence, including loans, credits, sector studies,
and EDI training to determine the effect on Nigeria's population and on the
development process. Particular attention will be given to those activities that
had an especially positive impact and those that were notable failures.
(b)                of Donor          Tahis study will review Nigeria's
experience with implementing donor aid from all sources. It will attempt to



- 26 -                        SCHEDULE I
Page 3 of 3
identify the causes for good and poor implementation experience, including
the longer term effects after project completion. It will then draw lessons for
application to future assistance programs and to improve performance during
project implementation. The review will cover capital investment projects,
technical assistance, institution building, and training.
(c)    Eyx    ssues. The study will carry out a survey of data from various
existing household surveys, organize, and analyze this data to define common
themes. Based on the analysis, strategic recommendations will be made for
development of programs and actions for the alleviation of poverty.
(d)    Gender-Related Issues. The study will carry out surveys of gender
disaggregated data and institutional constraints that exist to prevent women
from accessing productive resources including education, health facilities,
agricultural extension and credit.

NIGERIA
ECQNONMIC MANAGEMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
ASSESSMENT OF THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
(LOAN NO. 2480-UNI), LESSONS LEARNED AND
HOW DIFFICULTIES ENCOUNTERED ARE ADDRESSED
IN THE DESIGN OF THE PROPQSED PROJEC
1.                The loan to Nigeria for Technical Assistance (TAP) has made a significant
contribution to the preparation of components of the proposed Economic Management Project.
This paper reviews the record of the TAP and indicates how difficulties encountered have
influenced the design of the proposed new project.
2.                The TAP was approved by the Board in December 1984 and became
effective in May 1985. There were six objectives:
(a)   Strengthen the Federal Office of Statistics.
(b)   Establish a debt monitoring unit in the Federal Ministry of Finance.
(c)   Strengthen the ability of the Federal Ministry of National Planning to
monitor the execution of the National Development Plan.
(d)   Assist in the preparation of the Fifth National Development Plan.
(e) Establish training facilities for planners and economic managers.
(f)   Strengthen the ability of the Budget Department to allocate resources
effectively within government's priorities.
Asmsmt
3.                A review of the project indicates the following. The Federal Office of
Statistics is now mLsi more able to provide a flow of good statistics on the Nigerian economy.
External trade, consumer prices and national accounts statistics are much improved; there is now
a much enhanced data processing capability and a much busier publication programme; a census
of industry and business has been completed and the frame for agricutural sample surveys
redesigned; survey teams are now better equipped for their job. Further improvements are
required and can be supported under the proposed project.
4.                The debt monitoring unit has been established in the Federal Ministry of
Finance. However, it is not fully effective since the flow of data on debt from other parts of the
government is insufficient and irregular. Given the scale of Nigeria's debt, it must remain an
important objective of government's economic management to ensure that the debt unit can



_37 _SCHEDU1LE6
Page 2 of 3
provide accurate and timely analyses of Nigeria's debt, facilitating exchanges with creditors. The
unit requires more authority, more trained staff and determined management.
5.                Soon after the project was approved, the government decided, with full
support from the Bank, to change the system of forward planning of public expenditure from
periodic national plans to rolling three-year forward plans, supplemented by a strategic long-term
plan and annual macro-economic assessments. This change has been implemented with less
support from the project than expected. Though the new system is more appropriate to Nigeria's
circumstances, public expenditure decisions are not always informed by a sound sense of economic
and social priorities.
6.                On the training of planners, the project has supported the creation of the
National Centre for Economic Management and Administration, which has also benefitted from
substantial support from EDI.
7.                Tbe main contribution of the project to the Budget Department was in respect
of the major tariff review of 1988, which was an important component of the structural adjustment
programme.
8.                Beyond these achievements, the project has supported needs assessments,
design and initial implementation phases of major computerization programmes in the Federal
Ministry of Finance, the Federal Board of Inland Revenue, the Office of the Accountant General
and the Customs and Excise Department.
Delay in Disbursing and Reasons
9.                Disbursements under the project have been much less and much later than
expected, and $5.5 million of the loan was recently canceled. There are six principal reasons for
this:
(a)   Reluctance to use funds borrowed on the Bank's terms for technical
assistance, if grant funds or similarly concessional alternatives were
available.
(b)   Reduced costs on the local portion of the costs to be financed (30%), due
to the depreciation of the Nigerian currency.
(c)   Very centralzed and slow decision-making on procurement and other
project administration matters. This sometimes reflected a low priority
assigned to the project on the part of decision-makers, and sometimes
departures from  procurement procedures appropriate to particular
components.
(d)   Lack of continuity of project leadership, reflecting both changes in
organizational assignments and changes of individual appointments.
(e)   Lack of knowledge on computerization. At the time the project started,
there was very little knowledge of the process of computerization on the
part of all agencies except FOS. It took some time before the requirement



- 38-                           SCEDULE
Page 3 of 3
for a good assessment of need, followed by detailed specification and
design, and preparation of comprehensive implementation plans was
accepted. That stage has now been completed and much more rapid
progress is now possible.
(t)    Occasional hesitancy in using external resources in sensitive areas of
government decision-making.
(g)   Lack of adequate preparation of certain components.
How the Lessons from Past Experience are Taken into
Consideration in the Design of the Proposed Project
10.               The design of the proposed Economic Management project has taken the
experience of the earlier project into account. The terms of the IDA credit are much more
suitable for financing of Technical Assistance. The implementation arrangements provide for each
beneficiary agency to administer its own component, and it wil be up to that agency or ministry
to take all necessary actions. They will be able to obtain technical support from staff appointed
specially for the purpose in the Federal Ministry of Finance, but the purpose of these staff is
technical support, not control. Each agency will have to abide by the established procedures for
that agency for obtaining approval of procurement actions. A system of quarterly reports from
each beneficiary agency to the Project Officer will enable the Ministry of Finance to monitor
progress and to intervene if delays occur. The Annual Reviews will be used as the occasion to
take decisions regarding project implementation, including the reallocation of funds which are not
being used effectively. The appointment of technical staff in FMF to assist the beneficiary
agencies with implementation should ensure that there is continuity of project administration at
the technical level, and that documentation is well prepared for decisions to be made and
procedural problems prevented.
11.               As far as the computerization components of the project are concerned, the
project will focus on computerizing only those programs in agencies where detailed needs
assessments have been carried out and system design specifications completed. Implementation
of these systems would as far as possible be contracted to one company (especially in
implementing programs of different agencies under one ministry). The company/companies would
be selected on the basis of international competitive bidding among pre-qualified firms and they
will be in charge of implementing the entire system including procuring of hardware and software,
training, providing back-up support and maintenance. As far as the other agencies are concerned,
the project will finance the carrying out of detailed needs assessments, adequate specification of
systems and preparation of detailed implementation plans. If these plans are completed, the
project contains sufficient flexibility especially under the Institutional Support and Studies
component to finance procurement of specific items in accordance with the findings of the
assessments. For certain other agencies, the project will only finance procurement of office
equipment and supplies to facilitate the implementation of their respective projects and programs.
12.               The experience of the TAP clearly indicates that, as of nearly all Technical
Assistance projects is that a degree of flexibility has to be built into the project design, since needs
and the perception of need can change over time. The series of annual reviews will provide a
-medium for responding to changing needs.

NIGERIA
PROPOSED ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS
1.           This schedule describes implementation arrangements for the project, taking
into account the established procedures of the Federal Government.
Project Management
2.           The general principle to be followed is that decision-making will be at the
level of the agency/ministry implementing a component, and that the role of the technical staff
appointed in the Federal Ministry of Finance for purposes of this project are there to support
those agencies and ministries in carrying out the project. At the same time, to ensure that
borrowed funds are used when intended and that the benefits of the project are secured when
intended, agencies and ministries will submit summary quarterly reports on the progress of
their components to FMF. These will provide the basis for quarterly summary reports on the
progress of the project, of which copies will be sent to the Bank. The quarterly report which
precedes the Annual Review will be more elaborate and form the basis for the discussions at
the Anual Review.
3.           The Federal Ministry of Finance is appointing a Project Officer specifically to
provide assistance to agencies and ministries in carrying out the project. He or she will be
assisted by a Procurement Specialist, an Accounting Officer and a Senior Systems Analyst
also appointed specifically for the project. The latter will be available to assist agencies and
ministries in their computerization programmes.
4.           To initiate the project and to ensure there is a good understanding of the
implementation arrangements, a Project Launch Workshop would be held soon after the
project has been approved by the Bank's Board of Directors.
5.           Project Implementation. The purpose of the Annual Review is to take stock
of progress of the project in all its dimensions. The Review will be conducted by the Federal
Ministry of Finance, with participation by Bank staff, and participation of representatives of
the various beneficiary agencies. It will take place each year in October, prior to the
completion of the budget cycle, to ensure that budgetary provision for the following year will
meet the needs of the project. At the Review, implementation schedules will be reviewed and
revised where appropriate; the status of procurement examined; the work of consultants
discussed; the training programme examined, and the relation of the training programme to
other components of the project, will be reviewei. The status of the various studies will be
discussed. The Annual Review will be the occasion when any re-allocations of the loan which
may be justified are carried out, to reflect changes in cost estimates, cancellation or
unjustified postponement of components and when new components can be examined and a
decision made on their inclusion in the project. The record of the Annual Review will be sent
to the Minister of Finance and to the Director of the Bank's Country Department for
information or action, as required.



- 40 -                       SCHEDULE 7
Page 2 of 4
6.           Reallocation will take place upon satisfaction of the following criteria:
(a)   for failure to submit work program with specific target dates;
(b)   extended delays in executing agreed upon implementation steps; and
(c)   that local currency is not provided as anticipated.
7.           As indicated above, decisions on sub-components will be made by the agency
or ministry responsible for the component of the project, on the basis of such consultation as
seems necessary. Decisions on sub-components which would require a re-allocation of the
proceeds of the loan, or use of the unallocated funds, between Annual Reviews will be made
on the basis of consultations between the agency concerned, the FMF and the Bank, as
necessary. Correspondence on important matters between agencies and the Bank, and vice
versa, should be copied to the Project Officer, to ensure the FMF is properly informed.
Proiect Do uments
8.           The implementation of the project is governed by the agreements undertaken
by the Federal Government to the International Development Association (IDA) in the
Development Credit Agreement. The project is also described in some detail in IDA's
Memorandum to the President. Agencies and ministries should note that they are required to
adhere to the provisions of Scbedule 3 of the Credit Agreement on procurement and
consultants services and Schedule 4 in respect of use of the Special Account.
Staff Responsileg
9.           Each agency and ministry should designate those responsible for implementing
their components of the project. Those designated should include (i) the manager with overall
responsibility; (ii) those with the technical expertise required for effective implementation,
including supervision of consultants required for the project.
Bud1geing
10.          The designated manager in each agency is responsible for ensuring that
sufficient budgetary provision is made each year to complete the expenditure programmed for
the following fiscal year. Budgetary provision should be that to be funded by the credit and
that to be funded out of the agency's or ministry's own domestic resources.
Appintment of Cgnsultants
11.          If consultants are required to execute the component for which an agency or
ministry is responsible, one of the first duties of the manager responsible will be to have the
Terms of Reference of the consultants drafted and reviewed within the agency and by the
World Bank (see Schedule 3, section II of the Credit Agreement). Once agreement is reached
on the Terms of Reference, a short list of consultants with the necessary skills should be
prepared. In some cases, the necessary expertise is available in Nigeria; in other cases,
especially where international experience is a requirement, it will be preferable to look outside
Nigeria. In the latter case, agencies may seek the assistance of the World Bank, which has



- 41 -                       SCHEDULE7
Page 3 of 4
records of many consultants and their record of experience. The short list should be sent to
the World Bank for review, together with a draft letter of invitation, prior to despatch of
letters of invitation to consultants on the short list. The letter of invitation should describe the
evaluation procedure to be used, in accordance with the World Bank's Guidelines for the Use
of Consultants. Evaluation weights should be spelt out. On receipt of the submissions, the
evaluation report should be prepared and sent to the World Bank for review. Approval of the
appointment by the agency or ministerial tenders board should be sought at this stage. The
appointment letter should then be prepared and the terms negotiated with the consultant
selected. The letter should be cleared in draft by the World Bank and the authorizing officer
of the ministry or agency before signature. These steps may be compressed or simplified
depending upon the size of the contract or other factors.
Procurement
12.          Procurement will take place following the normal procedures of the agency or
ministry, but must be compatible with the provisions of Schedule 3 of the Credit Agreement
and the Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits referred to therein.
The general principles to be followed are that the Bank will wish to review the invitation to
bid before it is issued, the evaluation report on the bids before the results are made known
and the draft contract of supply before the contract is signed. The Federal Ministry of
Finance is appointing a Procurement Specialist specifically to assist agencies and ministries
carry out procurement actions in an effective and timely manner, and this officer will be
available to assist agencies and ministries comply with the guidelines. Review of procurement
documents and actions by the relevant tender board or other authority of the agency or
ministry will be necessary, and should be scheduled to ensure that delay does not occur.
Disbursements
13.          Disbursements from the loan account will be made in accordance with the
normal procedures for withdrawal of proceeds of World Bank loans and IDA credits.
Withdrawal applications will be prepared on the forms provided, and the Accounting Officer
appointed by the Federal Ministry of Finance for purposes of this project is available to assist
in this process. Each withdrawal application should have two signatures, by the responsible
manager of the agency or ministry and by an accounting official of the agency or ministry.
Sample signatures of all signatories should be sent to IDA, through the Multilateral
Department of the Federal Ministry of Finance, prior to the submission of the first withdrawal
application. IWA wUIl only disburse from the loan account in accordance with the payment
provisions of a signed contract, or to reimburse an agency or ministry for payments it has
made in accordance with a signed contract. In both cases, copies of the contract must be sent
to IDA no later than the time the first payment for the contract is requested.
Secial Ac
14.          A Special Account will be opened by the Government. A portion of the credit
will be paid into this account in advance to facilitate small payments. This account will be
operated in accordance with Schedule 4 of the Credit Agreement. Expenditure from this
account must be supported by ful documentation, which will be retained for inspection by
IDA staff, and be submitted to IDA whenever the Special Account is to be replenished.



- 42 -                      SCHEDULE7
Page 4 of 4
15.          Agencies and ministries other than FMF who need to make small payments
can either make them out of their own resources, and then claim reimbursement from the
Special Account, or submit a withdrawal application to the Bank in the usual way.
Accounts and Audi
16.          All agencies and ministries participating in the project will keep separate
accounts of expenditure on the project which will be audited in accordance with the Laws of
Nigeria and the provisions of Article IV of the Credit Agreement. For purposes of the Credit
Agreement, FMF will appoint an auditor who will carry out and submit the audits to IDA no
later than May 1 of each year. If the audit is not carried out by the Auditor General of the
Federation, the auditor should be selected from the approved list of the Auditor General.
