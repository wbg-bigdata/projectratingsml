INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF TIIE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
THE REPUBLIC OF TUNISIA
FOR A SECOND HIGHWAY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Republic of Tunisia for the equivalent of US$28 million to help fi-
nance a second highway project. The loan would have a term of 24 years, in-
cluding 4 years of grace, with interest at 8-1/2 percent per annum.
PART I - TIE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "The Economic Development of Tunisia - A Basic
Report" was distributed to the Executive Directors in January 1975. An up-
dating economic mission visited Tunisia in November, 1974; its report, "Memo-
randum on the Economic position of Tunisia," was circulated on May 23, 1975.
The main conclusions of the basic economic report and the updating mission
are reflected below. Country data sheets are attached (Annex I).
3.        Tunisia's development has been hampered by a scarcity of natural
resources. Much of the country is arid or semi-arid, and agriculture is high-
ly dependent on rainfall. Minerals are mostly of low quality and, apart from
phosphates, limited in quantity. Relatively small quantities of petroleum
were discovered in the mid-1960's, and have since become an increasingly
valuable source of revenue and export earnings. Industrial development has
been handicapped by the small size of the domestic market, as well as by a
lack of skills and experience. Tourism has developed rapidly and workers'
remittances have become a significant item in the balance of payments. Tunisia
has enjoyed a large amount of external aid and used it to expand economic and
social infrastructure, broaden the industrial base, make available a wide
range of social and welfare services to a large part of the population, and
increase the rate of growth. Per capita GNP increased by 4 percent annually
from 1961 to 1974. Like most developing countries, however, Tunisia has not
yet found adequate ways to cope with unemployment and poverty and to achieve
a balanced distribution of consumption among income groups, between urban and
rural areas, and among regions.
4.        Government strategy in the 1960's relied heavily on central planning
of investment and resource allocation, with the public sector playing a major
role in production as well as providing infrastructure and services. Foreign
exchange shortages and concern with inflation led to recourse to a pervasive
system of price determination and controls. An unusually long series of poor
crop years due to shortage of rainfall slowed down the growth of output. Many
of the investments in public enterprises proved to be uneconomic and private
initiative in most sectors except tourism and petroleum was limited.



-2
5.        The Government's present development strategy was introduced after
1969. Its principal objectives are: (a) accelerating growth based on export-
oriented industries by encouraging private initiative, reducing direct Govern-
ment involvement in production and relaxing administrative regulations; (b)
creating jobs, primarily in the expanding industrial sector, encouraging
worker emigration, reducing population growth and improving education and
training; and (c) maintaining internal and external financial stability.
The 1973-76 Plan set a target rate of GDP growth of 7 percent, providing
for a 5.4 percent growth rate in per capita private consumption. Investment
was projected to increase by 80 percent above the level of the 1969-72 Plan.
National savings were to finance three-quarters of investment. Exports of
goods and services were projected to grow at 8.8 percent per year at constant
prices and imports at 12.2 percent.   The Plan foresaw an increase in net ex-
ternal capital inflows of 55 percent over 1969-1972 average levels with ex-
ternal capital providing 23.5 percent of total investment; debt service was
to be held to below 20 percent of exports. The original Plan targets were
conservative in terms of both growth and savings potential, and have been
significantly affected by the impact of the changed petroleum and phosphate
prices on the Tunisian economy (paras. 9 and 10).
6.        The real growth of GDP has accelerated since 1970, reaching 9.4 per-
cent per annum during 1971-1973 and 10.5 percent in 1974, compared with 4.6 per-
cent during the previous decade. The acceleration can be attributed to for-
tuitous factors such as good weather, leading to record cereal and olive crops,
to important growth in tourism up to 1973, petroleum and phosphate revenues
and workers' remittances, and to the general re-orientation of Government
policy since 1970, which renewed self-confidence and initiative in the private
sector. Expansion of manufacturing and phosphate production has been signifi-
cant. By 1974, per capita GNP reached $420 at 1972 prices. The investment
rate, which averaged 23 percent of GDP at current prices in the 1960's, declined
to 21 percent in the early 1970's, but regained its previous level in 1974.
However, the increase of investment in real terms is below Plan projections.
National savings, on the other hand, rose sharply, from an average of 13.5
percent of GDP at current prices during the 1960's to 18 percent in 1973 and
21 percent in 1974. Consequently, the share of external borrowing in financing
investment dropped from 44 percent in the 1960's to 17 percent in 1973 and
9 percent in 1974.
7.        The balance of payments has improved steadily since 1967, with the
current account deficit declining from an average of $115 million per year
in 1961-1967 to $91 million in 1973 and $30 million in 1974. The effects of
improved terms of trade on the 1974 balance of payments have been significant.
Commodity export prices (mainly for petroleum, olive oil and phosphates) rose
on average by 67 percent over 1973, but were accompanied by a rise in import
prices of about 30 percent. In addition, receipts from services were affected
by the slowdown in tourist activity and in the migration of workers to Europe.
With estimated gross disbursements on external borrowing totalling $145 mil-
lion (instead of $203 million as foreseen in the Plan), net reserves stood at
$360 million at the end of 1974, equivalent to 4 months of imports.



- 3 -
3.        Because of price controls and Government subsidization of basic
consumer goods, and prudent fiscal and monetary policies, Tunisia has main-
tained relative price stability. Domestic price increases averaged 4.2 per-
cent between 1969 and 1973. In 1974 consumer prices increased by 4 percent
only; however, the official GDP deflator rose by an estimated 12 percent and
average investment costs increased by about 17 percent.
9.        In 1974, Tunisia was on balance a beneficiary of the change in the
world economic situation, but this favorable situation may change in later
years. Petroleum and phosphate prices have increased about threefold since
1973; olive oil prices also increased substantially in 1973 and 1974. As a
result, export earnings rose from $680 million in 1973 to $1,090 million in
1974. On the other hand, increases in import prices, combined with higher
domestic demand, caused payments on imports to grow from $750 million in 1973
to $1,100 million in 1974. The gains from terms of trade changes registered
by Tunisia in 1974 are expected to disappear by 1978-79. This reversal, which
already became apparent in the first months of 1975, will be the result mainly
of a stabilization or decrease in the prices of Tunisia's major exports, and
further increases in the prices of imported industrial goods. At the same
time, workers' remittances may continue to be restrained by slow economic
growth in Western Europe. The level of net reserves is projected to represent
about 4.5 months of imports in 1976 and subsequently to decrease to 4 months
of imports by 1980. At that time, the balance of payments may re-emerge as a
more serious constraint on Tunisia's development.
10.       The recent temporary increase in foreign exchange reserves and
Government savings, resulting from higher export prices and consequent in-
creases in tax revenue, does not call for a substantial revision in develop-
ment strategy. It suggests rather that Tunisia should step up its efforts to
achieve the investment rate projected in the original Fourth Plan, and to
realize higher growth rates and greater employment creation by better capacity
utilization. Since workers' emigration to Europe is now limited, an effort to
increase investment, particularly in labor-intensive industry and agriculture,
should be made. With an adequate savings level, the Tunisian economy has the
financial resources that should enable it to attain growth rates ranging from
7.5 to 9 percent per annum until 1980. In the longer term, higher rates of
growth would require substantially higher external aid than in the past. The
level of future growth would also depend on Tunisia continuing to stimulate
private investment, to increase the international competitiveness of industry,
and to improve public investments planning and implementation.
11.       Tunisia has made impressive social gains.    By 1974, primary school
enrollment had reached 88 percent and secondary enrollment 19 percent of the
relevant age-groups. Public health services have been greatly expanded with
many provided free. A family planning program has been introduced. Total
social expenditures increased by over 9 percent per annum; in 1974, they
accounted for 11 percent of GDP and for 40 percent of total public expenditures.
Nonetheless, major social issues remain. Further progress is needed in land
reform and in creating employment. The unemployment rate was estimated at



- 4 -
18 percent in the non-agricultural sectors in 1972, and underemployment in the
rural sector is high. There has been a growing concentration of productive
activities in a few urban areas, especially Tunis.
12.       So far as can be judged from available data, real incomes increased
in all sectors during the 1960's, yet by a lhigher percentage in the modern
sector than in the rural sector, due partly to the series of poor harvests.
In rural areas substantial income disparities remain, in part as a result of
the structure of land tenure. In the modern sector, especially in industry,
increases in real income in the 1960's exceeded the rise in productivity;
the income distribution trend has favored industrial workers. Thanks especial-
ly to the income redistribution effects of free social services, the propor-
tion of the total population living in poverty, as defined by the Tunisians
(i.e. earning less than D 70 annually at 1970 prices), was substantially
reduced during the decade. About 90 percent of this group continues to live
in rural areas, but, since 1970, increased agricultural output, a recent
rise in minimum agricultural wages, the inflow of workers' remittances from
abroad and the stabilization of basic commodity prices through Government
subsidies have improved the absolute, and possibly also the relative, posi-
tion of the poorest groups.
13.       Agriculture, the dominant sector in the economy, provides nearly
half of total employment, 30 percent of merchandise exports and 19 percent of
GDP (1972-74). Food processing industries account for another 4 percent of
GDP and over a third of value added in manufacturing. Agricultural production
rose substantially in recent years, largely as a result of favorable weather.
The potential for further growth is clear. While large infrastructure in-
vestments were made during the last decade, current policy emphasizes proj-
ects that make a rapid and direct contribution to production and recognizes
various constraints on agricultural development: absentee ownership, inse-
curity of tenure, inadequate access to agricultural credit, inadequate exten-
sion services, insufficient agricultural education, and underutilization of
irrigation investments. Under the Fourth Plan, more than $140 million has
been allocated to a rural development program to be executed by the provincial
administrations.
14.       During the 1960's, manufacturing production in Tunisia increased by
8 percent annually. There was a remarkable acceleration of growth in the
early 1970's due in part to record years for the olive oil processing industry
and to favorable developments in the textile and chemical industries. The
early thrust of industrialization was supplied by large import substitution
projects in the state sector. These suffered, however, from the limited
domestic market and shortages of experienced staff and management. More
emphasis has been put on export-oriented private industries since 1970. Under
the Fourth Plan, private manufacturing investment, particularly in food pro-
cessing, textiles, fertilizers and metals transformation, is expected to
average D 25 million per year, compared with D 12 million in 1972, and to
account for two-thirds of total investment in manufacturing; these targets
are likely to be exceeded. Foreign and domestic private investment is now
stimulated by a comprehensive incentive framework, and facilitated by the
streamlined approval procedures of the investment promotion agency. Foreign



- 5 -
investors are expected to contribute know-how and overseas marketing.
Tunisia's preferential trade agreement with the EEC is currently being re-
negotiated. Preinvestment work, and preparation of programs for re-equipment
and modernization in priority subsectors have been started. Tunisia plans
to develop petroleum and phosphate based industries, and possibilities in
metal and light electrical manufacturing for export are being explored. The
Government has recently established a special fund to encourage growth of
small industries and industrial decentralization, and has started a program
to establish industrial estates.
15.       The development of tourism in Tunisia is relatively recent.    Foreign-
visitor arrivals in Tunisia reached a record level of 780,000 in 1972, with an
annual rate of growth over the period 1961-1972 of 30 percent -- higher than
that of any other Mediterranean country. Since 1970, earnings from tourism
have been a major source of foreign exchange, having reached US$154 million
in 1973. While 1973 saw a drop in the number of visitor nights, and 1974
registered another overall drop, increased activity since the last months of
1974 provides a basis for optimism in the medium-term. The decline in tourist
inflow resulted from both external and domestic factors, the former being
mainly the effect of the energy crisis on the European tourist flow and adverse
currency movements, the latter inadequate development of infrastructure (par-
ticularly recreational facilities), shortages of trained manpower and the
inadequacy of services. The Government is endeavoring to alleviate their ef-
fects through a variety of measures including revised investment incentives,
increased efforts in marketing, and the preparation of codes to enforce
quality standards and more stringent zoning laws.
16.       Since the early 1960's Tunisia has received relatively large amounts
of external capital. During 1965-1973, loan commitments from Governments and
multilateral organizations averaged $100 million per annum, while disbursements
were some $76 million per annum, or $20 and $15, respectively, per capita per
annum. During this period, the major bilateral lenders, on a commitment basis,
were the United States (22 percent of official loans), France (14 percent), and
Germany (13 percent), with important contributions also from Canada, Italy,
Kuwait and Sweden. Loans from the Bank Group constituted the main single
source of total official lending, accounting for 25 percent of commitments
during 1965-1973. There has been a steady shift from program to project lend-
ing. Most aid has been obtained on concessionary terms; in 1969-1973, the
average terms of borrowing from bilateral sources were 3.6 percent interest
and 24 years to maturity, including 6 years of grace; from multilateral sources
5.4 percent interest and 28 years to maturity, including 6 years of grace.
Tunisia received annually some $30 million in grants during 1965-1973, as well
as capital inflows from private sources amounting to some $40 million annually.
Direct foreign private investment has been limited, but as a result of in-
creasing outlays on petroleum exploration and development and, recently,
foreign investment in manufacturing, it has shown a rising trend, from $17
million in 1965 to $54 million in 1973.



- 6 -
17.       Tunisia's total external public debt was $1,271 million, of which
$824 million were disbursed, at the end of 1973. Disbursed debt at the end
of 1974 is estimated at $900 million.   Debt service fell from 16 percent of
exports and workers' remittances in 1972 to 9 percent in 1974.    The debt
service ratio is projected to decrease to 8 percent by 1976, following recent
increases in commodity export earnings, but may rise after 1980 when external
capital requirements are likely to increase substantially.    While Tunisia is
capable of servicing substantial additional debt on less concessionary terms
than in the past, it should continue to seek part of its external resources
on concessionary terms so as to prevent the debt service ratio from rising
unduly in the long-term.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN TUNISIA
18.       Since 1962, Tunisia has received a total of twenty-two Bank loans
and ten IDA credits amounting respectively to $266.9 million and $65.7 mil-
lion, net of cancellations and refundings. Annex II contains a summary
statement of Bank Loans, IDA credits and IFC investments as of October 31,
1975, and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
19.       While there have been some problems in project execution, as in the
railways, agricultural credit and family planning projects, on the whole proj-
ect implementation has been satisfactory. Important institutional improvements
have been achieved. In a number of sectors, independent agencies have been
created or strengthened.
20.       In accordance with Tunisian priorities, past Bank Group lending has
emphasized support for long-term investments in social development and infra-
structure. Lending for urban and social development, including water supply,
education, family planning and the Tunis urban planning and public transport
project, accounts for 39 percent of Bank/IDA commitments in Tunisia. Lending
for transport, power and tourism infrastructure accounts for a further 28
percent. Agriculture and fisheries have received 14 percent of total commit-
ments. Industrial and hotel financing through Banque de Developpement Econo-
mique de Tunisie (BDET) has received 12 percent, and the Gafsa phosphate
development project accounts for 7 percent of total commitments.
21.       The Bank has participated in a number of projects in the transporta-
tion sector totalling $64 million. These include a highway project, a railway
project, a pipeline project and two port projects. With the exception of the
highway and the railways projects, wihich should be completed at the end of
the year, all have been completed satisfactorily.
22.       The first highway project (Loan 746-TUN) for $24 million was pre-
pared under a highway engineering loan for project preparation (S2-TUN for
$0.8 million) and approved in 1971. Under this project certain heavily
travelled trunk roads were modernized and light and aging pavements were



- 7 -
strengthened. Consultants were also provided to study institutional improve-
ments, the strengthening of maintenance operations, the system of road user
taxation, and improvement of 350 km of roads. Due to large cost overruns and
the demonstrated need for a four-lane highway, the three-lane road between
Tunis and Turki has been eliminated from the project with the approval of the
Executive Directors (R75-158 of July 14, 1975); it is expected to be financed
by the Kuwait Fund. The Government has provided supplementary funds to com-
plete the remaining project components.
23.       Two additional projects, a sixth loan to BDET and a second agricul-
tural credit project, are expected to be presented to the Executive Directors
this fiscal year. Future Bank lending to Tunisia is expected to support im-
provements in policies and institutions, in particular agricultural policies
and agencies and the planning and implementation machinery; it would also sup-
port measures to create employment and to introduce institutional reform.
The proposed lending program emphasizes investment in agriculture; this will
require substantial Government inputs of manpower and technical assistance
to support increased production and the creation of new institutions which
can reach the rural poor.
24.       Lending for industry has so far been largely through the main
Tunisian development finance company, BDET, and has mostly benefited medium-
size companies; the Bank has encouraged BDET to diversify its sources of funds
and progress has been made in this respect. The Bank has also lent directly
for the Gafsa phosphate mining project. Further loans for priority industrial
subsectors in which Tunisia has a comparative advantage would depend on the
progress achieved in the formulation of sound projects.
25.       The Bank Group accounted for almost 20 percent of disbursements of
official aid to Tunisia between 1969 and 1972 and is expected to maintain its
share, with that of the US declining and that of other, particularly Arab,
sources of funds rising. The Bank Group's shares in total debt outstanding
and disbursed at the end of 1972 (including loans from private sources) and
in debt service during 1972 were 11 percent and 7 percent respectively. Over
the rest of the decade, the Bank Group's share in disbursed external debt is
expected to rise to about 20 percent; its share in debt service will probably
rise to the same level.
26.       IFC has invested in a fertilizer plant, in BDET, in COFITOUR (a
company to promote and invest in tourism projects), in RYM (a large hotel
development) and in Industries Chimiques de Fluor, which will produce alumi-
nium fluoride from local fluorspar for export. IFC's most recent investment,
in May 1975, was in the Sousse-Nord project, an integrated tourism development
project. Including the Sousse-Nord project, IFC's net commitments in Tunisia
total $17.2 million.
27.       Since 1962 the Bank has chaired the Consultative Group for Tunisia
bringing together the principal donor countries and the institutions concerned
with the country's development. The most recent meeting of the Group was held
in Paris in June 1975. New participants in the Group included Saudi Arabia,
Japan, the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development and the Commission
of the European Communities.

PART III - TRANSPORTATION IN TUNISIA
28.       On becoming independent in 1956, Tunisia inherited a relatively well
developed transport system. Few additions were made until 1968-1969, when
major improvements to ports, railways, highways and airports were undertaken
in the light of the recommendations of a transport survey carried out by con-
sultants in 1968 under a United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) project
for which the Bank was the executing agency. This survey revealed two short-
comings in Tunisian transport policy: namely, (a) the absence of effective
administrative machinery for intermodal coordination in the transport sector,
and (b) an excessive degree of regulation. Since 1968 significant improvements
have been introduced. In 1970 a Direction des Transports in the Ministry of
the National Economy was established; this directorate was transferred to the
Ministry of Transport and Communications (MTC) on its establishment in
January 1974.
29.       As part of the first highway project, consultants carried out a
road user taxation study and made related recommendations which aim at a
simplification and rationalization of the tax system, and which are expected
to improve the allocation of traffic to modes and vehicle types. The Govern-
ment is now reviewing this study in order to formulate specific recommendations.
During negotiations, the Government agreed to review its recommendations with
the Bank and to prepare related new regulations on road user taxation prior to
April 30, 1976, and put them into effect promptly but not later than December
31, 1976 (draft Loan Agreement, Section 4.03).
30.       All transport tariffs are fixed by the Government and cannot be
exceeded. The Government also requires the semi-public transport companies
(Societes Regionales de Transport - SRTs) to provide certain of their services
at nominal fares well below the cost of operation and as a result, some SRTs
are in financial difficulties. The Government recognizes the need to provide
these companies with the funds required to cover losses in revenue due to
these reduced tariffs. During negotiations, the Government agreed fully to
implement this strategy prior to December 31, 1978 (draft Loan Agreement,
Section 4.04).
31.       Ilighways:  There are 16,850 km of roads, 45 percent of which are
paved. The road network is most developed in the north, where the bulk of
economic activity is concentrated. Although the road network is generally
adequate in extent, the most heavily travelled highways need major improve-
ments, and there is a need for more feeder roads to stimulate agricultural
production. Under the first highway project, maintenance operations were
satisfactorily reorganized and strengthened. However, recent traffic surveys
show that traffic is growing faster than expected and that there is a need for
major improvements of many roads, particularly in access roads to large cities.
In the long run, new traffic patterns are likely to arise as the result of a
more balanced regional development policy.



- 9 -
32.       The Direction des Ponts et Chaussees (DPC) in the Ministry of Pub-
lic Works (MPW) is responsible for the maintenance and development of the
highway system.   DPC has seven headquarters divisions, and the organization
of DPC was established following recommendations by consultants financed
under the first highway project. A major feature was that DPC was given
full responsibility for the management of its own equipment fleet, previously
drawn from another directorate in the   p    The Design Division in the DPC is
responsible for planning and designing highway projects, but DPC employs con--
sultants, both local and foreign, for the preparation of important highway
projects. Smaller projects are designed by the division. Design standards
applied are satisfactory.
33.       Between 1966 and 1970, annual expenditures for construction and main-
tenance of roads averaged approximately D 4.2 million. These low expenditures
reflected the low priority accorded by the Government to highway infrastruc-
ture investment. However, based on the recommendations of the 1968 Transport
Survey and the recommendations of the Bank-financed Hlighway Maintenance Study,
highway allocations grew from D 15.4 million in 1972 to D 17.3 million in 1975.
The sharp rise was caused by the need for repairs of roads damaged in the 1969
floods. The central Government provides all funds (maintenance and construc-
tion) for the primary and secondary road network, and the Gouvernorats for the
tertiary roads. The level of highway investment is in line with the economic
needs of Tunisia.
34.       As a matter of policy the DPC usuallv undertakes construction of
roads through contractors. This is a reversal of an earlier policy whereby
all highway construction was executed with DPC forces. Supervision of all
highway construction is carried out by the construction division of the DPC.
Periodic maintenance such as the renewal of the wearing course of paved roads
is carried out by contractors whereas routine maintenance is carried otut by
the field subdivisions with DPC's own forces. The qualitv of both construc-
tion and maintenance is satisfactory.
35.       Ports:   The country has four major commercial ports (Tunis-La
Goulette, Bizerte, Sousse and Sfax), and a fifth port is under construction
at Gabes for exports of phosphates and chemicals. The Bank has made two loans
totalling $15.5 million for construction and improvement of Tunisia's port
system.
36.       Railways:   The railway network consists of 479 route-km of standard
gauge in the north and about 1520 route-km of narrow gauge linking Tunis and
Gabes and serving the phosphate and iron mines of the interior. Because
emphasis has been chieflv on the renewal of old equipment and the acquisition
of new rolling stock, the condition of the track is poor, and major improvements
are required. In 1969, the Societe Nationale des Chemins de Fer Tunisiens began
to carry out a rehabilitation program with the assistance of a Bank loan and
an IDA credit together totalling S17 million.
37.       Airports:   There are three international airports (Tunis-Carthage,
Sousse-Monastir and Djerba-Mellita) to serve tourism demand. The domestic
airports, with the exception of those at Sfax and Gabes, are not equipped for
use by commercial aircraft.

PART IV - THE PROJECT
38.       The project was identified by a Bank mission which visited Tunisia
in September/October 1974. Project preparation was carried out by the Govern-
ment with the assistance of consultants financed under the first highway project.
The project was appraised in IMarch/April 1975, and negotiations took place in
Washington in October 1975. The Tunisian delegation was headed by Mr. M. A.
Soula of the Ministry of Public Works and included representatives of the
Ministries of Planning and Foreign Affairs. A detailed description of the
proposed project is given in the report entitled "tAppraisal of a Second High-
way Project - Tunisia" (No. 930-TUN) dated December 4, 1975, which is being
distributed to the Executive Directors separately. A Loan and Project Sum-
mary is attached as Annex III, as is a map showing project components.
Objectives and Description
39.       In line with the Government's overall development objectives and its
policy of stressing maintenance and improvement of the highway network, the
project would reduce transport costs on a number of more heavily trafficked
routes, improve future transportation planning and on-the-job training for
staff of the MTC, and foster rural development.
40.       The project consists of the improvement of about 225 kilometers of
the following roads: (i) Tunis-Libyan border road; (ii) Tunis-Medjez-el-Bab
road; (iii) Beja-Jendouba road; (iv) Tunis-Bizerte road; and (v) Hammamet-Korba
road. The Tunis-Libyan border road is one of the most heavily travelled roads
in the country and the construction of bypasses at Sousse, El Djem, and Sfax
should ease congestion considerably. The remaining roads are to be improved
through resurfacing, strengthening, widening and in some cases realignment of
existing sections. Bypasses will also be constructed around the towns of
Hammamet, Nabeul, and Beni Khiar on the Hammamet-Korba road.
41.       The project also includes provision of technical assistance for
transport planning and the preparation of a rural roads program. The tech-
nical assistance for transport planning would provide for about 70 man-months
of consultants' services to assist MTC in updating the 1968 Transport Survey
and for on-the-job training for permanent MTC staff and is expected to help
ensure that future investments in the transport sector would be made according
to an integrated transport plan based on economic criteria and reliable basic
data, including fleet statistics. About 110 man-months of consultants' ser-
vices would be provided to assist the MPW in the preparation of a program of
relatively inexpensive rural roads in the less-developed regions of Tunisia,
which is expected to foster agricultural and rural development.



Cost Estimates and Financing Plan
42.       The total cost of the project (including physical and price contin-
gencies) is estimated at $52.3 million of which $28 million is the foreign
exchange component. A detailed breakdown of project costs is given in Annex
III. The proposed loan would finance the foreign exchange component (54 per-
cent of total costs) net of duties and taxes; the local currency costs will
be financed by the Government.
Implementation
43.       The DPC would be responsible for the implementation of the road
works. All road improvement works would be carried out by contract and super-
vised by the DPC which is competent for this purpose. The DPC would also be
responsible for the preparation of the rural roads study whereas the MTC would
be responsible for the updating of the 1968 Transport Survey. The consulting
services would be provided to DPC and MTC by qualified and experienced con-
sultants satisfactory to the Bank.
Procurement and Disbursement
44.       For the improvement works, contracts on the basis of unit prices
would be awarded after international competitive bidding in accordance with
the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement. Works are expected to start about
mid-1976 and be completed about early 1979.    Proposals for consulting services
would be invited in early 1976, after terms of reference have been agreed
between the Government and the Bank.   The consulting services are expected
to be completed in the second half of 1978 for the updating of the Transport
Survey as well as for the Rural Roads Study.
45.       Disbursements would be made on the basis of 53 percent of total
expenditures (which is the estimated foreign cost component) for the highway
improvement works (civil works), and 70 percent of total expenditures for
consulting services. Disbursement is expected to be completed in FY 1980.
Justification
46.       The highways to be improved represent sections of Tunisia's highway
network most in need of improvement. The present transportation costs on
these sections are unduly high and the improvements will reduce vehicle operat-
ing costs, journey times, accidents and highway maintenance costs. Additionally,
a shift to larger (more economic) vehicles will be possible and increased travel
comfort available.
47.       The routes on which the project sections are located are inter-
regional. Benefits will therefore accrue to both long distance and local traf-
fic. The bypass sections will enable through traffic, particularly trucks,
to avoid the towns of Sousse, El Djem, Sfax, Hammamet, Nabeul and Beni Khiar.



- 12 -
48.       Based on the most probable estimates of construction costs, vehicle
operating costs, time costs, base year traffic and traffic growth, the proposed
investments in the project roads sections produce economic returns (ERs)
ranging from 18.0 percent to 42.0 percent. These ERs range from 16.5 percent
to 36.0 percent if travel time savings are not considered. The ER for the
road improvement program as a whole is 33.2 percent (26.4 percent without
travel time savings). Benefits accruing from the consulting services have
not been quantified. The assistance for transport planning is justified since
it will contribute to increased efficiency in highway administration and assist
the Government in upgrading the highway network. The main purpose of the rural
roads study is to identify and analyze rural roads for construction and im-
provement in areas where their adequacy is a serious obstacle to rural and
agricultural development.
49.       The Government controls tariffs and thereby limits profits on
vehicle operations. Since the tariffs are related (among other things) to
road conditions, transport cost savings from the proposed project road im-
provements are likely to be passed on to farmers and manufacturers, consumers
and passengers. The project will assist in stimulating economic development
and regional integration.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
50.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of Tunisia and the
Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii)
of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a draft resolution approving the
proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
The draft Loan Agreement conforms to the normal pattern for highway projects.
Features of the draft Loan Agreement of special interest are referred to in
paragraphs 29 and 30 of this report.
51.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
52.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
Cr. 94:   Second Education Project; US$13 million credit of September 16, 1966;
Date of Effectiveness: December 20, 1966; Closing Date: (original)
December 31, 1970; (current) December 31, 1975.
Ln. 1155: Third Education Project; US$8.9 million loan of August 13, 1975;
Closing Date: June 30, 1980.
The second education project is almost entirely completed. All proj-
ect schools have been accepted by the government from the contractors, virtual-
ly all equipment and furniture have been purchased, and most of it has been
delivered and installed. To allow for the completion of the technical assist-
ance program, the Closing Date was extended to December 31, 1975. The loan
for the Third Education Project is expected to become effective by mid-
January 1976.
Ln. 581:   First Water Supply Project; US$15 million loan of January 16, 1968;
Date of Effectiveness: May 29, 1969; Closing Date: (original)
December 31, 1973; (current) December 31, 1975.
Cr. 209:  Second Water Supply Project; US$10.5 million credit of June 30, 1970;
Date of Effectiveness: December 12, 1970; Closing Date: (original)
December 31, 1974; (current) December 31, 1975.
Ln. 989:  Third Water Supply Project; US$23 million loan of May 29, 1974;
Date of Effectiveness: September 24, 1974; Closing Date: June 30,
1979.
Because of problems with locally manufactured asbestos-cement pipe
completion of the First Project has been delayed. Constraints resulting from
lack of capacity in the local construction industry required that the Closing
Date be further set back until the end of 1975. Final project costs are ex-
pected to be about 6 percent below appraisal estimates (but 7 percent higher
in dollar terms because of devaluation). The Second Project is 12 to 18 months
behind schedule for the same reasons as well as because of initial delays in
final design. Final costs may be about 5 percent higher than original esti-
mates because of current inflation rates, but they will be 20-25 percent higher
in dollar terms. Because of delays in execution, the Closing Date has also
been extended to the end of 1975. Procurement for the Third Project has begun
and is on schedule.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Ln. 606:  Railways Project; U$$8.5 million loan and US$8.5 million credit
Cr. 150: both of June 4, 1969; Date of Effectiveness: September 16, 1969;
Closing Date: (original) December 31, 1973; (current) December 31,
1975.
The project was delayed both by floods (one year) and by financial
difficulties (one year). The financial problems were caused by non-payment
of freight charges by the railway's largest customer, the state-controlled
Gafsa Phosphate Company; operational deficits, due to low rates and fares;
and higher than estimated prices of rolling stock. The Government has reim-
bursed the deficit for the 1972-1974 period and has made an advance against
the 1975 deficit. A new cost-based tariff was introduced in January 1974;
a further increase in rates for phosphate traffic was approved in 1975.
Traffic continues to rise but operating results have not improved as much as
expected, and continuing Government contributions to the railways and further
tariff increases will be required. A reallocation of the proceeds of the
loan and credit permitted the placing of all outstanding orders; cost in-
creases of about $6 million for items in the original list of goods are being
financed by utilizing a Spanish line of credit. The credit has been fully
disbursed; the Closing Date of the loan was extended to permit completion of
disbursements.
Cr. 238: Population Project; US$4.8 million credit of April 5, 1971; Date
of Effectiveness: December 29, 1971; Closing Date: June 30, 1976.
Since January 1974 steady progress has been made both in the
National Family Planning program, and in the management of the project.     nhe
Government has welcomed and acted upon the recommendations of the IDA sector
mission, and there are strong indications that the program will now continue
to develop positively.   The cost and availability of goods and services for
civil works have been greatly affected by the construction boom being exper-
ienced in Tunisia resulting in much higher costs than anticipated and delays
with respect to some structures. NORAD has agreed to participate in financing
the cost increases.
Ln. 746: Highways Project; US$24 million loan of June 9, 1971; Date of
Effectiveness: October 26, 1971; Closing Date: June 30, 1976.
Project execution, which fell behind schedule initially due to
lengthy Government procedures and changes in key personnel, is now proceeding
satisfactorily. Progress in reconstruction and rehabilitation of roads and
bridges is good. The estimated cost of the project has increased significantly,
mainly as a result of dollar devaluation. The Executive Directors have ap-
proved (R75-158 of July 14, 1975) the deletion of one major road section from
the project. The Government is providing supplementary funds to permit com-
pletion of the other project components.

Ln. 779:  Agricultural Credit Project; US$5 million loan and US$3 million
Cr. 263:  credit, both of July 12, 1971; Date of Effectiveness:    January 25,
1972; Closing Date: (original) July 31, 1975, (current) June 30, 1976.
The Project has experienced serious difficulties concerning subloans
for farm machinery and dairy farms, due to competing credit programs with more
liberal terms (FOSDA/FSA) and deteriorating price relationships between invest-
ment and outputs. In early 1975 the Government remedied the competition be-
tween FOSDA/FSA funds and IBRD funds in financing similar investments and the
mechanization component is now disbursing satisfactorily. The date palm planta-
tion component is almost completed. The dairy farm component has suffered
from fixed milk prices; funds in this category will also be used to finance a
milk processing facility. New commitments under the Project ended on
September 30, 1975, but disbursements are expected to continue until the end
of 1976, with a consequent need further to extend the closing date.
Cr. 270: Fisheries Project; US$2 million credit of September 24, 1971; Date
of Effectiveness: afy 24, 1972; Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
The project is now being actively implemented after earlier diffi-
culties and delays experienced in design of an economic project vessel suit-
able for operation by traditional fishermen. Problems were also encountered
in selecting the marine engine to equip the project boat. Increases in the
cost of hulls and engines led to a reduction of the number of boats to be
constructed under the project from 335 to 180; despite price increases, the
project boat is still economic because of the sharp increases in fish prices
since appraisal. The demand for the project vessel is also strong as it rep-
resents a significant improvement over traditional vessels of the same caliber
and costs about 23 percent less than these vessels.
Ln. 815:  Power Project; US$12 million loan of April 20, 1972; Date of
Effectiveness: August 4, 1972; Closing Date: (original) July 31,
1975, (current) June 30, 1976.
The project is nearing completion. Both gas turbines, as well as
all transmission lines and substations are in operation. Costs of the project
are not expected to exceed the original estimate. A recent tariff increase
will raise STEG's overall electricity revenues by 12 percent so that the rate
of return is expected to reach 9.2 percent in 1979 (8.5 percent in the Loan
Agreement).
Ln. 858:  Tourism Infrastructure Project; US$14 million loan and US$10 million
Cr. 329:  credit, both of September 28, 1972; Date of Effectiveness:    June 26,
1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1977.
The project experienced initial delays because of the time required
to adopt legislation establishing the public land corporation which is to ac-
quire land in the project zones for resale to investors. The development
studies for the six project zones, being executed by consultants, are partially

completed. Invitations for bids for some project works have been issued;
contracts are now being concluded and some works are underway. Recent cost
overruns may lead to eventual amendments in the project. A study of Government
incentives for investment in tourism has been completed.
Ln. 798: Fourth Development Finance Company Project; US$10 million loan of
February 9, 1972; Date of Effectiveness: April 13, 1972; Closing
Date: March 31, 1976.
Ln. 881: Fifth Development Finance Company Project; US$14 million loan of
February 20, 1973; Date of Effectiveness: May 24, 1973; Closing
Date: March 31, 1978.
Disbursements under Ln. 798 are slightly behind schedule, while
disbursements under Ln. 881 are ahead of schedule. Business greatly exceeded
projections in 1973, 1974 and 1975. Persistent problems include the adequacy
of provisions against possible losses, the substantial amount of arrears of
hotel borrowers and the lack of valid mortgage security for certain sub-loans.
Appropriate solutions to these problems have been discussed with BDET (ex-SNI)
in the context of negotiations on a sixth loan to BDET. The dependence of
BDET on the Government and the IBRD is expected to be reduced by BDET's raising
substantial funds from local and foreign sources.
Ln. 937: Tunis District Urban Planning and Public Transport Project; US$11
Cr. 432: million loan and US$7 million credit, both of October 5, 1973;
Date of Effectiveness: September 24, 1974; Closing Date:
December 31, 1976.
Due to delays in appointment of consultants and completion of the
necessary legal actions and opinions, the loan and credit for this project
only became effective in September, 1974. As the offer of the Tunisian sup-
plier fell within 15 percent of the international reference price agreed with
the Bank/IDA, the public transport company (SNT) has decided to award him the
contract for supply of project buses. The District has faced difficulty in
recruiting the staff foreseen under the project, and in establishing itself
as an effective interlocutor of national agencies. Steps to deal with these
problems have been taken. The equipnment for the suburban railway component
has experienced major price increases, and the Government is considering ways
of financing the cost overruns.
Ln. 1029: Hotel Training Project; US$5.6 million loan of July 17, 1974;
Date of Effectiveness: November 4, 1975; Closing Date: October
31, 1978.
Due largely to delays in the acquisition of sites for project hotel
training centers by the National Tourism Office (ONT), effectiveness of the
loan for this project was delayed. Consulting architects have been selected
from official lists provided by the Ministry of Equipment. The project unit
initially created for the tourism infrastructure project has been enlarged by
addition of the staff necessary for the construction of the hotel training
centers. Recruitment of technical assistance personnel is nearly complete.

Ln. 1042: Gafsa Phosphate Project; US$23.3 million loan of October 1, 1974;
Date of Effectiveness: March 14, 1975; Closing Date: June 30, 1979.
Procurement for the new underground mind development (Sehib) is
being completed after a delay of about 10 months due to problems with consult-
ing engineers. The modernization program for existing mines is proceeding on
schedule. Terms of reference for a study of development possibilities in the
mining region are under discussion.
Ln. 1068: Irrigation Rehabilitation Project; $12.2 million loan of December
31, 1974; Date of Effectiveness: September 18, 1975; Closing Date:
June 30, 1982.
Execution of the project has begun. Both project authorities are
now selecting consultants; the key advisor for the Office for the Development
of Nebhana (OMIVAN) has assumed his duties.
Ln. 1088: First Urban Sewerage Project; $28 million loan of February 18, 1975;
Date of Effectiveness: August 15, 1975; Closing Date: June 15, 1979.
The contract has been awarded for rehabilitating and expanding the
existing treatment plant. Final designs are being carried out by consultants
for the remaining works and the bids for the first major contracts are expected
to be requested before the end of the year. The Centre Technique pour le
Developpement de la Construction is engaging technical experts to assist in
preparing the inventory of basic data required for the study on Tunisia's con-
struction industry.
