INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED DEVELOPFENT CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA FOR A SECOND ELECTRICITY
DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Indonesia for the equivalent of
US$400. million on standard IDA terms to help finance a second electricity
distribution project.
PART I - INTRCDUCTION
2.        Indonesia has received twenty-one IDA credits amounting to
US$273.4 million.   The composition of this lending reflects the priorities
for rehabilitation and development established by the Government.    Indonesia's
First Five Year Plan (1969-1974) gives highest priority to agriculture.
The Association has already extended three credits to help develop plantation
crops on government estates.   Other credits for agriculture include four to
assist rehabilitation of irrigation systems, one for fisheries and one to
help increase rice yields throughout Indonesia by establishing a seed
multiplication program for high-yielding rice varieties.    The Association
also organized a consortium of lenders to finance a major expansion of the
PUSRI fertilizer plant.   These ten credits account for over half of the
Association's lending to Indonesia.
3.        In order to accelerate rehabilitation in other sectors, credits
have also been made for highways, power, telecommunications, education,
and population, and a $10 million credit for a development finance company
(BAPINDO) was approved by the Executive Direqtors on May 30, 1972.   In
addition, the Association has extended three technical assistance credits to
help finance preinvestment studies undertaken by the Government which have
helped to establish investment priorities over a wide range of activities.
A summary statement of IDA credits and IFC investments is at Annex I.
4.        Two other credits have been negotiated and are expected to be
ready shortly for consideration by Executive Directors: a fourth agricultural
estates project, and a project in a priority field not hitherto-assisted
namely, inter-island fleet rehabilitation.
5.        The first IDA credit to Indonesia was made in September 1968.
Twelve of the twenty-one credits have been made since July 1, 1970.   The
program is thus relatively new, and largely for this reason the undisbursed
portion of the credits is large. Another contributing factor is that
virtually every credit has introduced extensive institutional reform,
involving creating of new project authorities, drafting of new charters, and
enactment of new legislation, all of which have taken much time.   Disbursements
of several credits has been delayed because of management problems.
Comments on individual credits are in Annex I.

PART II  - THE ECONOMY
6.        The latest Bank economic report on Indonesia (EAP-27a), dated
November 30, 1971, concluded that Indonesia's economic progress continues
to be satisfactory.   The economy appears to be growing at around 6-7
percent, while price stability is being maintained and exports are
increasing.   Production of rice, the basic commodity, has increased
substantially for the fourth successive year.   In the industrial sector,
especially in textiles, there is further substantial growth.   With
private foreign investment accelerating and the rehabilitation and
expansion of domestic enterprises being fostered under official programs,
the prospects of industrial growth from the present small base are good.
Country data are presented in Annex II.
7.        Economic progress is at an early stage, however, and the problems
which remain to be tackled are large.   The population project referred to
in paragraph 3 represents a first step in dealing with high birth rates in
densely populated areas and marks an important reversal of earlier attitudes.
Advances have been made in formulating plans, programs and projects and in
starting to implement them, but the limited managerial and financial resources
still present a serious obstacle. The pressure on financial resources is
evidenced by continuing high rates of interest and by the necessity for a
devaluation in August 1971, designed in part as a precaution in the face of
international uncertainties and in part to restrain import demand following
a loss in foreign exchange reserves.   In 1972 there are prospects of a
significant increase in both foreign exchange earnings and Government
revenues, as a result principally of sharp increases in oil production and
in the volume and value of oil exports.   The demand for resources is so
great, however, that the need for aid will continue at a high level as a
supplementto domestic resources available for public and private investment
and improvement of essential services even after allowance for increased
earnings from oil.
8.        Government revenues in 1971/72 (April-March) are now estimated
to have been 20 percent higher than in the previous year.   A much larger
increase, 36 percent, is forecast for 1972/73.   The largest item in this
increase would be taxes on expected higher earnings of foreign oil companies,
but other revenues would increase by 18 percent.   The expected increase
in revenues of about $360 million would finance increases in salaries and
material expenditures in the ordinary budget, while still allowing for a
doubling (to $328 million) of the surplus available for the development
budget.   Together with counterpart funds generated by program aid (estimated
at $229 million), this would provide for a development budget in 1972/73
of $557 million, which is 40 percent larger than that for 1971/72.   Further
increases in oil export prices effective on April 1 could add an extra
$48.2 million to revenues.



-3-
9.        Exports were expected to rise by 10 percent in 1971/72 with
the prospect of a 29 percent increase to $1,270 million in 1972/73.
Most of this is accounted for by rising oil exports which will expand
by a further $50-60 million because of the April price increases. Timber
exports, up 44 percent in 1971/72, are projected to increase by 27
percent to $220 million in 1972/73. For all other exports, aggregate
value may have been down somewhat in 1971/72, due primarily to lower
prices for rubber, but a moderate price recovery is expected this year.
10.       Imports of goods and services of $1,778 million are projected
for 1972/73, which would mean a current account deficit of just over
$500 million, slightly larger than that experienced last year. Debt
payments will be slightly lower; the increase in private capital inflows
is expected to be somewhat higher; and public capital inflow, at $520
million, is expected to be higher by $75 million than that estimated for
1971/72 because of increased disbursements on projects.
11.       Bank Group assistance to Indonesia is a part of the international
support being given in increasing amounts through the Inter-Governmental
Group for Indonesia (IGGI). A swumary of aid commitments is included in
Annex II. These commitments have risen from $200 million in 1967 to well
over $600 million for 1971/72. The proportion of project aid has steadily
increased over this period, but substantial program aid remains essential
as support for the balance of payments and - in spite of strong domestic
revenue efforts - as a source of additional funds for the development
budget. For 1972/73 the Government requested IGGI aid of $670 million,
$350 million for project aid and $320 million for program aid, including
$110 million in food supplies. At its meeting at Amsterdam in December 1971,
the IGGI accepted this request, endorsed by the Bank and Fund, as appropriate
in relation to Indonesia's requirements; at the subsequent pledging session
on April 25-26, express or implied commitments by IGGI members, in fact,
amounted to some $724 million, approximately meeting the request for food
and non-food program aid and substantially exceeding the amount sought in
project aid.
12.       The rescheduling arrangements for pre-1966 external debt which
culminated in April 1970 in agreement on a long-term settlement of the debts
held by Western creditors and Japan, and subsequent agreement on similar
lines with several Eastern European countries, resulted in a low ratio of
external debt service to exports of about 11 percent. It will rise
appreciably throughout the 1970's as grace periods expire on aid received
after 1966, but should remain manageable during the decade if exports
increase, if restraints on medium-term borrowing are maintained and if



new aid remains available on concessional terms similar to those at present
obtained from the IGGI. All aid from the IGGI members has been given on
concessional terms approximating the standards set by the DAC.
The Bank Group Strategy
13.       Indonesia's continuing economic development will require, in
addition to substantial external support, some change in emphasis from
rehabilitation and improvement in infrastructure to the expansion of
capabilities for sustained additional production in agriculture, minerals,
forestry and manufacturing. It will also require continued dtrengthening
of the institutions for the planning of development and management of the
economy. Key problems of welfare and income distribution, including family
planning as well as regional development and related patterns of
employment and population movement, will be important in Indonesia's
development strategy.
14.       The economic work and the lending operations of the Bank Group,
including the work of the Fesident Staff in Indonesia, have been oriented
toward these objectives. The focus of the Bank's economic work is upon
providing assistance to the Government in the current preparation of the
next five-year plan (1974-79).
15.       Bank Group financing is shifting its emphasis from infrastructure
to direct production in agriculture and industry. The latter would include
industrial estates and industrial finance. Transport, power'and other
infrastructure will, of course, continue to be part of the financing
program as will operations in education and family planning. Project
possibilities are also likely in water supply, urban development and
tourism.
16.       Consistent with Indonesia's large external requirements, and
difficult balance of payments problems, the Bank Group's assistance
(aside from IFC investments)'has been and will continue to be in the
form of IDA credits. In recognition of the urgent need for institutional
reforms, most IDA projects will continue to involve major reorganization
of existing institutions or establishment of new ones, as noted in paragraph
5 above. At the same time to supplement the Government's efforts in
improving administration and management, credits will continue to emphasize
and include appropriate provisions for consultants' services, training and
other technical assistance as appropriate.



-5-
17.       Priority projects often involve a high proportion of local
expenditure, and it is not practicable to meet Indonesia's need for
external capital if external lenders lend only for the import component
of projects.   The Bank Group has therefore covered some local expenditure
in its financing and will have to continue to do 80.
PART III - THE ELECTRIC POWER SECTOR
Background
18.       In October 1969, the Association made a US$15 million equivalent
credit (Credit 165-IND) for the first stage rehabilitation and expansion
by PLN of the Djakarta electricity distribution system and for consulting
services, aimed at the establishment of a sound public utility organization.
The project as then formulated, and the general approach to the system
expansion, as well as rehabilitation of the institution as such, was to be
subject to modification following a thorough review by consultants of system
requirements, planning policies, standards of services and design practices,
as well as PLN's responsibilities and organization.   This review has now
been completed and its results form the basis of the present project and
enable the Association to continue lending in this sector.
19.       The Indonesian power sector was nationalized in the mid-fifties.
In 1965, Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN) was created as the state electricity
authority responsible for generation, transmission and distribution of
electricity throughout the country.   Until recently it has operated under
the authorization of a body of laws relating to Government agencies and
enterprises in general, and a 1965 Government decree concerning it specifically,
under which PLN has been part of the Ministry of Public Works and Electric
Power.   Within that Ministry, responsibility for planning and new construction
rested with the Directorate Ceneral of Pbwer.
20.       As of January 1, 1971, the total installed generating capacity
operated by PLN amounted to 532 MW - 35% hydro, 19% steam and 46% mainly
diesel and some gas turbine.   Two thirds of this capacity was located in
Java.   The publicly-owned multipurpose Djatiluhur plant also generates
125 MW of power which is sold to PLN.   Privately owned (captive) generating
capacity, for which no accurate statistics are available, is estimated at
about 450 MW of which about 75% is located in Java.   In the FLN operating
region which includes Djakarta, the site of the proposed project, captive
installed capacity is estimated at some 70 MW.   The Djatiluhur hydroelectric
plant is the main power supply for Djakarta; the second main supply is from
FLN's oil-burning 50 MW Tandjung Priok thermal station located on the city's
outskirts.
21.       FLN transmission facilities comprise 2,900 kms of lines, carrying
voltages of 25 kV to 150 kV, and an aggregate transformer capacity of about
1,200 MVA. The power system in Java is not fully interconnected and there
are five separate transmission networks,



- 6 -
22.       The electric power supply in Indonesia is unreliable and suffers
from very low voltage conditions, high energy losses (24% in 1970, in part
accounted for by theft), and a large pent-up demand.   These conditions,
which are most severe in the Djakarta area, have lead to the installation
of large amounts of captive power.
PLN's New Charter and Responsibilities
23.       It was recognized at the time of the first credit that considerable
strengthening of PLN's role in the power sector was needed if it were to
become a sound public utility organization.   As an essential part of the
technical assistance provided under the project, a new Charter was drafted
by the consultants to provide PLN with sufficient authority to plan, build
and operate the electric power system.   After protracted discussion within
the Government the Charter has been agreed with the Association, submitted
to the President and promulgated.   This has taken considerably longer than
the time stipulated in the agreement for Credit 165-IND.
24.       The effectiveness in practice of PLN's new Charter will be
observed and reviewed with PLN in detail and suggestions for further revision
made as may be necessary.   The Government is now reviewing - with the
intention of thoroughly reformulating - the existing body of law governing
public enterprises in Indonesia, and the PLN Charter will also have to be
reviewed in the ligh of any such legislative change, which is expected some
time next year.
25.       The new Charter provides PLN with the exclusive right and respon-
sibility to generate, transmit and distribute electric power and to construct
and operate present and future generating plants and power networks, including
the necessary procurement, in accordance with sound utility and commercial
practice.   PLN wi-ll recommend tariffs to the Minister of Public Works and
Electric Pbwer, for approval by the President of the Republic.   The Charter
also specifies that tariffs should eventually produce revenues sufficient to
cover all operating expenditures, including depreciation, debt service in
excess of depreciation, and taxes, and to provide a surplus for financing
a reasonable portion of PLN's development program.
26.       PLN is managed by a Board of Directors, chaired by the President
Director and composed of Directors in charge of various departments.   The
Directors are appointed by the President of the Republic on the advice of
the Minister for a term of five years and are eligible for reappointment.
The President Director serves as the chief executive officer and, as set
forth in Section 3.03 of the draft Credit Agreement, the Government has
agreed to consult with the Association on appointments to this position.
He is responsible to the Minister of Public Works and Electric Power, who
determines general policy and who is assisted in this task by an Advisory
Board composed of the Minister of Finance, Minister of Industry, and
Chairman of the National Planning Agency.



-7-
27.           PLN is fully owned by the FBpublic of Indonesia and its equity
corresponds    present to the net valuation of the physical and other assets
in the public power sector owned by PLN. PLN has the power to borrow funds
for development with the approval of the Minister of Finance.
Ownership of Assets
28.       The Government undertook in Credit 165-IND to endow PLN with
full and exclusive responsibility for the public electric power sector,
including, inter alia, construction and ownership of all facilities. This
undertaking was prompted by the fact that the Directorate General of
Electric Power and sometimes other agencies of the Government planned,
constructed, and owned the facilities which PLN operated. The Directorate
General of Electric Power was abolished in July 1970 and full transfer of
its responsibilities to PLN has been made. Ownership of all facilities
which it operates has been vested in PLN and all facilities presently
under construction by other departments of the Government, which should
properly be under PLN jurisdiction, will be transferred to PLN upon their
completion.
Collection of Arrears
29.       At the time of negotiations for the first electricity distribution
project, substantial amounts were long overdue to PLN from the Government
for consumption of electricity by Government departments. Under Credit 165-IND
the Government undertook to pay within one year of the date of signing of
the Credit Agreement, the more than Rp. 5 billion which would then be due,
and thereafter to keep payments current. This obligation has been only
partly fulfilled in that the Government has paid Ip. 2.3 billion as part
payment of accounts due from Government agencies up to March 31, 1971. In
addition, the Finance Ministry has informed the Association that the Bureau
of the Budget and PLN have agreed that the balance of the arrears for that
period, Rp. 3.4 billion, would be offset by equivalent payments from the
budget to PLN for the fiscal year 1971/72. The Government has also agreed
to pay in cash during fiscal year 1972/73 the arrears, presently estimated
at Rp. 2.4 billion, owed to PLN from other Government departments for
electricity consumed during FY 1971/72. Further, the Government has assured
the Association that it has made adequate budgetary provisions for fiscal year
1972/73 and for all its departments and agencies to pay, commencing May 1,
1972, the current bills owed PLN for serrice. Any shortfall in current payments
would be made up by a supplemental appropriation available to PLN not later
than September 30 of the following year. Certification, by an independent auditor
acceptable to the Association, that amounts owed PLN for service from April
1971 to the end of 1972 have been paid is a condition of disbursement for
equipment under the proposed project.
System and Project Planning
30.       Planning for development of the power sector in the past has been
inadequate. System planning is now done on a regional basis but there is



- 8 -
still insufficient coordination between regional plans.   Moreover, most
of the system planning is done by various foreign consultants with little
participation by PLN staff.   To help overcome these problems, management
consulting assistance is included in the proposed credit to assist in
increasing PLN's planning capability, with the immediate objective of
enabling it to coordinate the planning of the various regions.   The present
five year development plan for power (a modified version of the original
1970-74 plan) calls for a total investment of US$305 million equivalent -
43% for generation (363 MW), 18% for transmission, 39% for distribution.
This is a sensibly balanced program, because the present transmission
distribution networks are not sufficient to market the power available
from existing generating plant.
31.       The development of electric power will require substantial
amounts of capital and will therefore depend heavily on external assistance.
Unless PLN can obtain a large amount of aid, it may not be able to meet
all the future demand for power.
Future Financial Position
32.       Any financial forecasts for PLN must be regarded as only
indicative given the wide range of assumptions and the uncertain nature of
PLN's growth, future tariff structure, accounting and development.
Nevertheless, it appears that by 1975, with the assistance of tariff
increases and appropriate cost control measures, PLN should;.be able to
achieve full coverage of its operating costs including depreciation.
Beyond 1976, PLN should be able to begin financing an increasing portion
of its development from earnings.
33.       The Government has indicated that it intends to,provide capital
to PLN in the future, including amounts provided by the Association,
in the forn of loans on conventional terms.   However, funds provided by the
Government to the present project, including the proceeds.of the proposed
credit, would take the form of equity to provide a basis for borrowing in
the future.   This procedure was also followed in connection with the proceeds
of the first credit.
34.       The consultants have made considerable progress in helping PLN to
improve its operations.   The basis for an accounting system has been created,
which is expected to produce accounts that can be audited, starting with
accounts for the year 1973 (if not for earlier years).   A systematic
on-the-job training program has been started and the valuation of fixed assets
is nearly completed.   The Government has agreed to submit to the Association
by October 1972 the Balance Sheet as of December 31, 1971, which would reflect
the revaluation of assets for the first time.   PLN's management .has accepted
recommendations for a new accounting and budgeting system, providing the
management with the means of control over cash, budgeting, inventory,
depreciation, and revenue collection.   One of the most important functions
of the proposed credit would be to provide the outside assistance needed
to assure continued progress with these reforms.

PART IV - THE PRJECT
35.       The proposed IIA Credit of $40 million together with the $15 million
provided under Credit 165-IND, would cover the foreign exchange cost of the
five-yeaz program for rehabilitation and expansion of the distribution system
in Djakarta, including the strengthening of the high-voltage transmission ring
around the city, together with continuation of engineering consulting services
for the project and management Qonsulting services for improvement of PLN1s
organization. Project cost estimates are given in Annex III.
36.       Primary distribution will be rehabilitated and expanded; the
voltage will be standardized at 20 kV - with a gradual phasing out of existing
12 kV and 7 kV circuits. The secondary distribution system will be rehabilitated
and expanded, and a voltage changeover will replace the existing, predominantly
127/220 volt facilities with a standard voltage of 220/380 volts. The 70 kV
transmission system around Djakarta will be reinforced to provide an adequate
supply to the main sub-stations.
37.       Credit 165-IND and the proposed credit would finance 600 kms of
20 kVc primary distribution underground cable, equipment for 130 kna of 20 kV
primary distribution overhead lines, about 260,000 kVA of distribution
transformers for the rehabilitation of 160 existing distribution sub-stations
and the construction of 750 new ones, the associated secondary distribution
circuits, poles, meters and switchgear, and the cost of exchanging or
modifying consumers' apparatus due to the change in the secondary distribution
voltage.
38.       The distribution system on completion of the project would be a
balanced installation with adequate primary capacity to enable future growth
to be supplied from additional distribution transformers and feeders. I!oreover,
it would raise the quality of service to a level of reliability which would
encourage commercial and industrial finus to obtain their electric power
requirements from -PLN rather than installing their own generators. Generating
capacity now in operation or under construction will be sufficient to meet
the forecasted requirements of rjskarta in 1976.
39.       The services of engineering consultants would continue to be
employed for the system rehabilitation and expansion, including planning,
training for construction and the voltage change-ovwer, preparation of bid
documrenta and evaluation of bids, and the coordination and supervision of
construction and installation. V&th the enlarged scope of the project an
amount of US$2.9 nillion included in the proposed credit is needed for this
purpose.
40.       PLN has heretofore carried out installation and construction of
distribution facilities with its own forces. However, in view of the much
larger size of the Project than any previous work of PLN it is necessary to
provide substantial additional training of PLN's labor force as well as
assistance in construction supervision. iether this arrangement will prove
satisfactory vill be detenrined by the results experienced in the first
area of Djakarta in which the installation woric is to be carried out, beginning
in the last quarter of 1972. If necessary PLN's forces would be supplemented
by those of local electrical contractors, of whom there are a number, for
subsequent work.



- 10 -
41.       The proposed credit also includes US$3.6 million equivalent for a
continuation of management consulting services.   These services would
include: (i) a training program for PLN personnel by foreign experts in
accounting, power plant operation, inventory practices and administrative
procedures; (ii) the planning of more permanent training policies and
programs; and (iii) director advisory assistance on organization, general
management, system planning, financing and accounting.    Extensive management
and training services of this nature are essential if PLN is to become an
efficient utility.   In Section 3.01 of the draft Project Agreement, PLN has
agreed to promptly furnish and review with the Association the. recommendations
of its management consultants, and after agreement between the Association
and PLN on the appropriateness of the recommendations to initiate within
three months implementation of those which are accepted.
42.       PLN has agreed that it will take the measures necessary to provide
revenues sufficient to cover operating expenses, taxes, interest, and.
amortization of debt, and finance a reasonable portion of capital expenditure.
However, these objectives cannot be achieved immediately.    A study is being
made of PLN's tariffs and during the next few months PLN and the Association
will review the matter and agree on an earnings test and an appropriate level
of tariffs.   These arrangements are set out in Section 4.03 of the draft
Project Agreement.
43.       No ecological problems arise in connection with the Project.    Primary
and main secondary distribution circuits will be underground, as are the
present ones; secondary feeders and service connections would be generally
overhead as it would be prohibitive in cost to do otherwise for the low
density domestic demand in Djakarta.
44.       As in Credit 165-IND there would be international competitive
bidding for all goods used in the project, except spare parts-and replacement
components needed for existing equipment for which such bidding would be
impractical.   The latter are estimated to cost about US$1.0 million equivalent.
There are Indonesian factories manufacturing transformers and cables which may
wish to tender bids for supply of these items for the project.    For the purpose
of bid comparison in such cases, local bids would be accorded a margin of
preference of 15% or the actual customs duties payable by non-exempt importers,
whichever is lower.
45.       The Association would disburse against the c.i.f. price of imported
goods and the foreign exchange cost of consultants' services and training.
Where an award is made to a local manufacturer, disbursement would be made
for the ex-factory price, net of local sales taxes.
46.       Under Credit 165-IND the pace of disbursements have been slow,
amounting to only about US$1.8 million at present, entirely for consulting
services.   Orders for,.qU1 M.Mt* Me been placed and contracts awarded for
a total of US$3.6 million equivalent.   Installation of equipment will proceed
only late in 1972.   The delay in disbursement and installation was the result
of several factors.   The appointment of consultants, without whom the project
could not be started, was delayed by about six months. Subsequently the start



of work on the project was found to be more difficult than expected, partly
because of the confused conditions in the sector and partly because of the
inexperience of the Indonesian staff in reviewing and approving plans, and
specifications and in bid evaluations.   However, this phase appears
to have passed and planning for the entire five year period, including the
preparation of most bid documents, has generally been completed, and the
project should now proceed expeditiously.
47.       It is expected that the remaining funds under the first credit
will be substantially committed during the next 6-9 months.    Some
of the allocations under the first credit - for management consulting services,
for example, - have been completely committed.
48.       Since already the generating capacity now in operation and
under construction will be sufficient to meet the demand forecast for 1976,
the justification and, indeed, high priority of a distribution project are
obvious.   A financial return of 18% has been calculated on the basis of
reasonable sales assumptions and tariffs.   This return has been calculated
on the financial benefits which will accrue from the project has proposed.
It is understated in view of the additional but non-quantifiable benefits
that would be derived from the improved quality of service to present and
future consumers and from the fact that the system has necessarily been
designed with primary and secondary capacities which will enable growth
beyond 1976 to be supplied by the additional installation of distribution
transformers and feeders.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS
AND AUTHCRITY
49.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of
Indonesia and the Association, the draft Project Agreement between Perusahaan
Umum Listrik Negara and the Association, the Recommendation of the Committee
provided for in Article V, Section 1 (d) of the Articles of Agreement of the
Association, and the text of a resolution approving the proposed credit are
being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.   The draft agreements
follow closely the Credit and Project Agreements for Credit No. 165-IND.
50.       I am satisfied that the proposed Development Credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATIONS
51.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Development Credit.

III. Credits Experiencing Delays in Disbursement
The first and second agricultural estates projects (Crs. 155
and 194-IND), have had problems in appointing boards, executive manage-
ments, and consultants'for various services.   The Government has been
inrformed of the steps which need to be taken to remedy the situation,
and has undertaken to do so.  Similarly, initial delays.have been
encountered on the telecommunications project  (Cr. 210.-IND), but all
major contracts have now been awarded ex¢ept for the tropospheric scatter
system for which the consultants have Just completed the survey and
prepared specifications. Disbursements on two projects electricity
distribution (Cr. 165-IND) and education I (Cr. 219-INDt), have been
delayed because of problems in the selection and appointment of
consultants by the Government; for the electricity project, however,
orders are now being placed for equipment and disbursements.are expected
to rise satisfactorily. As to the education project, .negotiations
with consultants were protracted partly because of uncertainties regarding
the liability of foreign consultants and contractors to-'Indonesian income
tax, but the contract is now signed.
Work on the first irrigation rehabilitation project is proceeding
well, and disbursements are on schedule.   The second such project was
delayed by three months due to difficulties in establishing the new
project authority, and further delays occurred because of procurement
difficulties, but construction contracts are now being awarded and dis-
bursements are expected soon to rise sharply.  On the third project,
planning and design are progressing, but there are possibilities of cost
overruns and delays, which are currently under review; meanwhile,
construction is under way.   Design and construction of the fisheries
project (Cr. 211-IND) have been delayed by about one year, pending
completion of a master plan to develop the project site,-and disbursements
have been accordingly.set back; the master plan is now ready and prospects
for successful project implementation now look good.   In 'the case of the
PUSRI fertilizer expansion project (Cr. 193-IND), though disbursements
will not rise appreciably until the second half of 1972 when financing
of equipment contracts will commence, the project is proceeding well and
the borrower's performance on this complex project can be considered
satisfactory.

Procurement
Arrangements:          Procurement of goods financed by the credit would be
on the basis of international competitive bidding,
except for spare parts and components of equipment
needed for replacement, estimated to cost about
US$1.0 million equivalent, for which such bidding
would be impractical.   For the purposes of bid
comparison, bids by local manufacturers would be
accorded a margin of preference of 15 percent or
the existing actual customs duties payable by
non-exempt importers, whichever is lower, for goods
manufactured   or processed locally.
Disbursement
Arrangementst          The Association would disburse against the c.i.f.
price of imported goods and the foreign exchange
cost of consultants' services.   Where an award is
made to a local manufacturer or assembler, disbursement
would be made for the ex-factory price net of taxes
on the sale of the goods involved.   Disbursement would
not be made from this Credit until the funds available
under Credit 165-IND are committed.
