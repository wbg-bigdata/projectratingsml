APPRAISAL OF
SECOND ELECTRICITY DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises a project consisting of the second phase of
a five-year program, 1971-75, for rehabilitation and expansion of the Djakarta
electricity distribution system and for management consulting services for the
purpose of establishing a sound electric utility organization, responsible for
the public power sector of Indonesia.
ii.       The Association made Credit 165-IND for US$15 million equivalent in
October 1969 for the first phase of the program. The beneficiary was
Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN), the state-owned electricity corporation,
which would also receive the proceeds of the proposed second credit. Consider-
able delays were experienced by PIN in getting the project underway. However,
disbursements under Credit 165-IND amounting to US$1.6 million have been made
and US$3.0 million has now been committed. Installation of equipment is to
commence in the last quarter of 1972, and the full amount of the credit is
expected to be committed in the first quarter of 1973.
iii.      The total cost of the five-year program i8 estimated at about
US$74.77 millionequivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$55 million
equivalent. To cover fully the latter amount, a second credit of US$40 million,
in addition to the first credit of US$15 million, is proposed. In addition to
enabling the five-year program to be completed, it would enable the impetus of
the efforts now underway to improve PLN with the assistance of extensive manage-
ment consulting services to be maintained.
iv.       Association lending for the first and second phases of the Djakarta
electricity distribution project would thus represent two-thirds of the total
cost. The balance of funds would be provided predominantly from the Govern-
ment in the form of budget allocations to PIN, which is not yet in a position
to make any significant contributions from internal resources towards its
capital expenditures.
V.        PLN's institutional, financial, managerial and staff weaknesses are
the major obstacles to the development of the power sector. To overcome them,
provision was made for the extensive management consulting services noted above
under the first credit. Consultants were retained to review operating and
financial practices, as well as the organizational and legal framework of the
public power sector.
vi.       The consultants recommended a new Charter for PLN to give it adequate
responsibility for the sector. After long delay, the Indonesian Government
prepared a Charter which contained most of the consultants' recommendations
and was acceptable to the Association. Under the provisions of the new Charter,



- ii -
PLN should be enabled to fulfill its role as the national electric utility
in a reasonably autonomous and effective manner.
vii.      On the management consulting side, assets have been evaluated and
accounts put in order to the extent that PLN's accounting and financial
activities may now begin to be normalized on conventional utility lines.
Financial, administrative, technical and construction operations have been
reviewed, appropriate systems and methods devised, and a massive 2-3 year
training program to ilqlement the reconmended practices is now being initiated,
and would be financed by the proposed credit.
viii.     At present, PIN's revenues do not quite meet operating expenses,
excluding depreciation. By means of rate increases, improved collection of
accounts and other improvements in efficiency, it is probable that PIN could,
by about 1975, cover its operating expenses, including depreciation, from
revenue. From that point onwards progress should be achieved towards contrib-
uting to future expansion funds generated internally.
ix.       The need for the distribution project is a vital one; service con-
ditions are now so poor that virtually no additional electricity can be
supplied. The internal economic return on the project would be at least
18%.
X.        The proposed credit should result not only in putting the distribu-
tion system in Djakarta in good condition, but in bringing the institutional
and organizational state of PIN to a condition where it should be enabled to
function efficiently and eventually to become financially viable. On this
basis an Association credit of US$40 million is justified.

APPRAISAL OF
SECOND ELECTRICITY DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      In October 1969 the Association made a first credit, Credit 165-IND,
of US$15 million equivalent to the Government of Indonesia for the rehabilita-
tion and expansion of the Djakarta electricity distribution systam and for
management consulting services aimed at the establishment of a sound public
utility organization.  The beneficiary of this credit was Perusahaan Listrik
Negara (PLN), the state-owned electricity corporation.
1.02      Difficulties were experienced in getting the first credit underway.
The selection of consultants was delayed six months by PIN and, subsequently,
greater difficulty than anticipated was experienced by PLN's staff in process-
ing bidding documents prepared by the consultants and in dealing with the
evaluation of bids and contract awards. As a consequence disbursenents under
the first Credit have only been made for consulting services to date, amount-
ing to US$1.6 million. However, US$3.0 million for purchase of equipment has
been committed and construction is expected to begin the last quarter of 1972.
It is expected that most of the funds remaining uncommitted in Credit 165-IND
will be committed by the end of the first quarter of 1973.
1.03      The distribution work financed under the first Credit was based on
preliminary plans pending a full review by consultants of the needed improve-
ments and expansion of distribution facilities in Djakarta. SOFRELEC of France
was retained for this purpose. Their review resulted in the recommendation of
a five-year program, 1971-75, of rehabilitation, voltage conversion and expan-
sion of distribution facilities involving a total cost of US$74h77 million
equivalent.
1.04      The first Credit provided only part of the US$55 million foreign
exchange component of this program. The proposed credit would finance the
remaining US$40 million.  Preparation, procurement and construction for both
credits would follow a common time schedule aimed at completing the entire
program by the end of 1975. As the second credit would be in effect the
second tranche of a total credit of US$55 million, this report deals with
the entire program.
1.05      The experience under Credit 165-IND reflects the poor state of
conditions in PIN when the Credit was made in 1969, as described in Annex 1,
and the Credit has required intensive supervision by the Association. Not-
withstanding the problems, considerable progress has been made. While the
distribution project itself has proceeded slowly, there is no doubt that
both the work envisaged under the first Credit and its continuation under
the proposed credit will be concluded and the installations will be of a
sound technical nature. On the management consulting side, assets have been
evaluated and accounts put in order to the extent that PIN's accounting and



- 2 -
financial activities may now begin to be normalized on conventional utility
lines.  Moreover, financial, administrative, technical and construction
operations have been reviewed, more appropriate systems and methods devised,
and a masaive 2-3 year training program to implement the recommended practices
is now being started. Finally, PFI i8 to be provided with a new Charter,
putting it in a position where it can fulfill its role as the national electric
utility in a reasonably autonomous and effective manner. The proposed credit
should result not only in putting the distribution system in Djakarta in good
condition, but in bringing the institutional and organizational condition of
PIN to a condition where it should be enabled to function efficiently and in
due course become financially viable.
1.06      This report is based on information obtained with the cooperation
of the Resident Staff by Messrs. King, Jacob, Beach and Montfort during
various missions to Indonesia in September, October and November 1971 and
March 1972.

I.  THE POWER SWTOR
Economic Background >
2.01     The Indonesian archipelago consists of some 3,000 islands extending
about 5,000 km east-west and 2,000 lkm north-south, with a total land area of
approximately 1.9 million km2. The population, estimated at 124 million
people in 1971, is growing at an estimated rate of 2.6% annually. Almost two-
thirds live on the island of Java which represents only 7% of thQ total area
and where the population density is about 600 inhabitants per kV   one of the
highest in the world. On this island is Djakarta, the capital city with a
population of about 5 million people, where the proposed electricity distribu-
tion project is located.
2.02     The economy of Indonesia is essentially based on agricultural
activities which contribute about half the national product and provide for
employment and income of more than 70% of the population. Per-capita Gross
Domestic Product is estimated at US$70-90. Among its natural resources,
oil and gas are important, the former being the single most important export
commodity. Manufacturing industry, located mainly in the large cities of
Java, is little developed and in great need of rehabilitation. This applies
equally well to the public utilities including the power sector where the
installed generating capacity is only about 8.9 watts per inhabitant, one of
the lowest in the world.
2.03     Since 1966, the Government has successfully concentrated on stabil-
izing prices. Economic policies are being directed towards rehabilitation,
and new development in a context of free market conditions. As a result,
there has been in the last two years a marked acceleration of domestic and
foreign private investment which together with the potential impact of improve-
ments in infrastructure--including power--and other factors should make
possible a growth rate of the economy in excesa of 5% p.a. in the next few
years.
Organization of the Sector
2.04     The Indonesian power sector was nationalized in the mid-fifties.
In 1965, PIN was created as the state electricity authority responsible for
generation, transmission and distribution of electricity throughout the
country. It has operated under the authorization of a body of laws relating
to Government agencies and enterprises in general, and a 1965 Government decree
concerning it specifically, under which P2IN has been responible to the Ministry
of Public Works. P12N is organized into fifteen geographic operating divisions,
or Ecploitasi. Amex 1 describes the organization of the sector and the manner
in which PIN has functioned within it.  In essense, the sector was in very poor
condition when Credit 165-ID]) was made in 1969 but, with the assistance of the
managenent consulting services provided under that credit, it is slowly improv-
ing. As noted in Annex 1, while the manageent and supervision personnel of

- 4 -
PIN appear responsible and technically qualified, they are inexperienced in
management practices and techniques. The management consulting activities
will lead to substantial development of management capabilities over the
course of time.
Existing Sector Facilities
2.05      AB of January 1, 1971, the total installed generating capacity
operated by PIN amounted to 532 MW--35% hydro, 19% steam and 46% diesel and
gas turbine--two-thirds of which was located in Java (Annex 3). The location
of the facilities is indicated on the Map. The publicly-owned multipurpose
125 MW Djatiluhur hydroelectric station generates power which is sold to PLN.
Privately-owned generating capacity, for which no accurate statistics are
available, is estimated at about 450 MW, of which about 75% is located in
Java. In Exploitasi  III, the PLN operating region which includes Djakarta,
captive installed capacity is estimated at some 70 MW.
2.06      PLN transmission facilities comprise 2,900 Im of lines of voltages
from 25 kV to 150 kV and an aggregate transformer capacity of about 1,2000 MVA
(Annex 4). The power system in Java is not fully interconnected. There are
five separate transmission network systems, the Kalikonto and Madiun systems
in East Java, the Tuntang and Ketenger systems in Central Java and the West
Java system. In the latter, 150 kV transmission lines link the 125 MW
Djatiluhur hydroelectric plant with the cities of Bandung and Djakarta. The
Djatiluhur station is the main power supply for Djakarta; the second main
supply is from PIN's oil burning 50 MW Tandjung Priok thermal station located
on the city outskirts.
Operating Conditions
2.07      The quality of the electric power supply in Indonesia is described
in detail in the Appraisal Report for Credit 165-IND. In summary, it is
extremely poor as characterised by poor reliability, very low voltage condi-
tions, high losses (26% in 1970, in part accounted for by theft) and inability
to supply a large pent-up demand. These conditions are most acute in the
Djakarta area, the largest load center in the country. Due to insufficient
maintenance, especially of diesel units, a substantial amount of PIN's
installed capacity is frequently out of order.
Generation and Sales
2.08      During 1970 PLNla sales amounted to 1,550 OWh. The table below
summarizes the public sector operating results in 1966-70 for the whole of
Indonesia. The average annual increase in sales in 1966-70 was 8.1%. However,
many of PIN's historical records are suspect, which may account for some of
the inconsistencies in the figures. Details for the fifteen Exploitasi are
given in Annex 5.
1 As Djatiluhur is predominantly an irrigation facility, it is not owned by
PIN but by a separate agency.

L Losses include auxiliary power used in thermal stations.
2.09      The breakdown of aales by class of consumers was as follows in 1970:
Consumer class          Percontage
Residential                  57%
Commercial                    8%
Administration               17%
Industrial                   X,8
Total                   00$
The comparatively low industrial component is in part due to the fact that
much of industry provides its own power aupply. The total number of consumers
was estimated at less than a million in 1970, of which 90% were domestic.
Even with an average of four people per family, this would mean that lees
than 3% of the total population has electric service.
System Planning and Technical Assistance
2.10      The first national five-year program (FY70 - FY74) for development
of the power sector prepared by PIN was inadequate and in any event could not
have been financed by the limited Government budget allocation, which covers
only about one-tenth of the capital requirements envisaged. This problem was
surmounted as follows: Planning of the system was put on a regional basis,
for example, the East, Central and West Java regions on that island.  Then,
each year, the national planning agency, BAPPENAS, makes proposals for project
aid and technical assistance to the Inter-Governmental Group on Indonesia.
In response, particular donor countries or national or international lending
agencies provide technical assistance for system planning and projects feas-
ibility studies for specific project areas with the expectation that they
would provide project financing aa well for such areas.
2.11      These arrangements have the advantage of ensuring within each
project area development of the power system on an integrated basisd consistent
with the foreign currency financing available. A disadvantage is that there
is inaufficient PIN participation in the planning process, and the coordination



-6-
of regional plans may not be adequate. Management consulting assistance is
included in the proposed credit to help develop over time PIN's planning
capability, with the immediate objective of enabling it to coordinate the
planning of the various regions, and fill a proper role in the overall
planning process.
DeveloDment Plans
2.12      The present national five-year FY70-FI74 development plan for power
calls for a total investment of US$305 million equivalent--43% for generation
(363 MW), 18% for transmission, 39% for distribution. This is a sensibly
balanced program given that the transmission and distribution networks are
not sufficient for marketing the power available from existing generating
plant, and there is reason to put enphasis on distribution.
2.13      During the second five-year plan, FY75-FY79, the planned total
capital outlay is about US$400 million equivalent. It would add another
700 MW of generating capacity, bringing the total for Indonesia to almost
1,500 MW at the end of FY79, with an appropriate expansion of transmission
and distribution facilities. The table shows estimates of capital expendi-
tures for the two plans periods:

to increase by 943 MW at an average growth rate of 13.6% per annum, not
including the large Asahan hydroelectric project, located in North Sumatra,
which the Goverrment hopes to have constructed, together with an aluminum
smelter, by private enterprise.

Power Demand
2.16      As indicated in paras. 2.10 and 2.11 the development of power faci-
lities will be, to a large extent, based on the availability of funds, particu-
larly external assistance. The load growth in each Exploitasi may, therefore,
be limited by the facilities to be provided and PLN's aggregate load growth will
reflect the situation. Several studiea of FLN's load growth have been made, of
which the most recent two, made in 1970 and 1971, concluded that annual growth
should be about 12% and 14-15% respectively. The Association and PLN's
consultants, SOFRELEC, reviewed the information in the light of the general
situation and in particular of the comitments and anticipations for foreign
aid, Annex 6. They were in agreement that load growth should lie in the above
range. However, it was felt that until some of the facilities are installed,
for example, the distribution facilities in Djakarta, load growth would be
necessarily restricted. For this reason, the consultants concluded and the
Association agreed that about a 10% annual sales increase up to 1975, and 14%
thereafter, would be realistic. This assessment has been used as the basis
for estimating PLN's revenues in the period 1972-80, Annex 9.

III. INSTITUTIONAL ASPECTS
General Background
3.01      As described in Annex 1, the institutional framework and practices of
the Indonesian power sector have not been conducive to the improvement of sector
organization and to the remedying of its serious technical, financial and
managerial problems.
PLN Legislation
3.02      The government undertook in Credit 165-IND that management consul-
tants would be employed inter alia to review and make recommendations on the
organization and operation of the electric power sector, including the adequacy
of the governing laws for the purpose of PLN's conducting its operations
according to sound utility practice, and to implement a new law appropriate
to govern the operations of PLN following discussion of the results of the
study with the Aasociation.  The consultants, SOFRELEC, prepared a new Law on
Electricity, the draft of which was under discussion with the Indonesian
Government (GOI) for nearly a year.
3.03      As a result, the Government has prepared a new charter which reconciles
the substance of the SOFRELEC proposals with impediments in existing laws, which
must be retained until those laws governing PLN and other Government companies are
amended or rescinded, requiring legislative action over 1-2 years. The new
charter broadly follows the proposals made by SOFRELEC, but differs in some
respects. It vests the Minister of Public Works and Power with ultimate policy
control over PLN, subject to an advisory board consisting of the Ministers of
Finance, Industry and National Development Planning. SOFRELEC had proposed an
autonomous Corporation with a board consisting of representatives of Government
Ministries, the Planning Commission and consumers.
3.04      The proposed new charter also contains an article concerning the
disposition of 'reserves' that is archaic, However, the article would have no
practical impact on PLN's financial operations in the foreseeable future since
it will take a considerable number of years before PLN would be financially
viable and have reserves to dispose of (para. 4.09).
3.05      The new charter proposed by GOI was acceptable to the Association
with the understanding that should experience indicate its advisability, the
Association would seek to have GOI amend the charter, possibly to provide
greater autonomy for PLN and to have the 'reserves' clause changed or rescinded.
This was acceptable to the Government which advised that studies are underway
regarding the Government Act (of 1960) which inter alia covers these provisions
and that it is expected that new legislation regulating the operation of public
enterprises may be proposed to parliament by the end of 1972.
3.06      The new charter of PLN has been promulgated as a Government decree
within the framework of existing laws, rather than as a separate law, which would
require time-consuming legislative action.



-9-
Proposed Charter
3.07      The proposed charter is summarized in Annex 2.  The charter provides
PLN with the exclusive right and responsibility to generate, transmit and
distribute power and to construct and operate future generating plants and
power networks, including the necessary procurement, in accordance with sound
commercial and industrial practice. PLN will recomend basic tariff rates to
the Minister of Public Works and Power, which would be approved by the President
of the Republic. The charter provides that tariffs should produce revenues
sufficient to cover all operating expenditures, including depreciation, debt
service in excess of depreciation and taxes and to provide a surplus for
financing of further expansion.
3.08      PLN would be managed by a Board of Directors including the President
Director and at least two other Directors, and composed of the President of
PLN and several of its Department Heads. The Directors would be appointed by
the President of the Republic on the recommendation of the Minister for a term
of five years. In effect, the Board of Directors would be a management
committee. During negotiations the Government agreed that the Association
would be given the opportunity to comment on the qualifications of any candi-
date for the post of President-Director.
3.09      The capital of the Corporation would be fully owned by the Republic
of Indonesia and would correspond to the net valuation of the physical and
other assets in the public power sector transferred to PLN. PLN would have
the power to borrow funds for development, subject to the approval of the
Ministry of Finance.
Ownership of Assets
3.10      The Government undertook in Credit 165-IND to endow PLN with actual
autonomy for the public power sector by transferring all responsibilities
previously held by the Directorate General of Electric Power to PLN. When
the Directorate General of Electric Power was abolished in July 1970, it was
understood that concurrent transfer of all responsibilities to PLN was
effected.
3.11      In April 1972 the Government approved the transfer to PLN of all
assets listed in the balance sheet as of December 31, 1970, which was prepared
by PLN and the consultants and included all assets properly under PLN juris-
diction. The Government advised that assets financed by the Government after
December 31, 1970 would be tranBferred to PLN. The Government approved at the
same time the principle according to which the assets of PLN are being revalued
and agreed to submit to the Association by October 1972 the Balance Sheet as of
December 31, 1971, which would reflect the revaluation of assets for the first
time.
3.12      During negotiations representatives of the Government and PLN
confirmed that ownership of all electric power generating and distribution
facilities in operation, is fully and legally vested in PLN and, ownership
of all such facilities under construction by other departments or agencies of
the borrower would be vested in PLN upon their completion.



- 10 -
Management Consulting
3.13      During the past two years a systematic effort has been made by the
consultants to detect inefficiencies in operation of existing facilities and
correct them by giving practical advice to local personnel. In numerous
instances, even amall adjustments in procedures, correction of misuse of
equipment, and proper and regular maintenance procedures resulted in improved
efficiency. At the same time operation and maintenance procedures have been
documented and systematic on-the-job training based on these procedures has
started. A center was established to train PLN staff in voltage conversion
and construction (para. 5.11), and a more extensive training program is
intended (see para. 5.12) to further improve operating efficiency.
Financial Management and Accounting
3.14      The consultants have made considerable progress in the valuation
of fixed assets, review of accounting procedures and financial practices,
and in institution of improved methods. They have submitted recommendations
for a new accounting and budgeting system consisting of a uniform code of
accounts, cash, budget and inventory control, depreciation and customer
accounting procedures. PLN's management had accepted these and other
recommendations, and with the authority aonferred on it by the new charter,
will implement them. During negotiations, PLN agreed to furnish the Associa-
tion by July 15, 1972 all the recommendations of its management consultants
made up to June 1, 1972* Recommendations received up to June 1st and those
received after this date will be reviewed with the Association without delay.
Those that the Association and PLN agree to be appropriate will be initiated
within three montha of reaching agreement.
3.15      Under the existing system the head office of PLN has little control
over receipts and disbursements of cash in the district offices, which were
handled by the Exploitasi managements. With the guidance of the consultants,
control of cash is expected to become fully centralized in the next two years;
Exploitasi XII (Djakarta) is now operating under this system and the other
EXploitasi are to likewise be converted to it in due course.

IV. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
General
4.01      In the financial sphere, PLN has advanced considerably from the near
chaotic conditions existing when Credit 165-IND was approved.  The progress
achieved (para. 3.14), which marks one of the accomplishments of the consul-
tants, is probably halfway to the goal of putting the financial operations on
an efficient and sound utility basis. The further management consulting
services planned under the proposed credit (para. 5.12, Annex 8) are essential
to achieve this goal.
Past Record and Present Financial Position
4.02      When the appraisal report for Credit 165-IND was prepared in 1969,
it was not possible to obtain meaningful financial statements showing the
financial position of PLN. Detailed financial statements employing conven-
tional utility accounting practices have now been prepared with the assistance
of the consultants for the years 1967-1971. Given the limitations of the
information on which they are based, the statements can be regarded as only
an indication of PLN's past financial performance.
4.03      PLN's financial position can best be judged by comparing the 1971
operating results with the hypothetical operating results required to achieve
a reasonable rate of return on the revalued assets in service after depre-
ciation. To achieve a rate of return of 8%, which would be considered
reasonable, the operating income after depreciation would have to be Rp. 6.7
billion when, in fact, PLN made an operating loss of Rp. 3.2 billion. There
exists, therefore, a gap of almost Rp. 10 billion. Indeed, PLN's total revenue
from electricity sales was only Rp. 14.3 billion in 1971.
Assets of PLN
4.04      As noted in para. 3.11 the transfer to PLN of assets previously
owned by the Government has been agreed, and is recorded in the Balance Sheet
as of December 31, 1970. The assets transferred are shown as Government
advances, but in future years will be treated as equity.
4.05      The revaluation of assets in accordance with the consultants'
recommendations will be reflected for the first time in the Balance Sheet for
December 31, 1971. The surplus arising from the revaluation of fixed assets
and stocks, Rp. 34 billion has been transferred to an Asset Revaluation
Reserve. The Government has indicated its willingness to accept the 1971
closing Balance Sheet, with assets revalued and has approved the principles
adopted for the revaluation. The 1971 Balance Sheet should be available and
approved by October 1972.
4.06      The payment of taxes arising from revaluation of assets has been
considered by the Government. The Government haa agreed that PLN should be
exempted from paying them or permitted to treat them as an equity contribution



- 12 -
to its capital by the Government. For the purposes of this appraisal it has
been assumed that taxes will be treated as equity.
Accounts Receivable
4.07      Under Credit 165-IND the Government conmitted itself to payment to
PLN of accounts receivable for Government department usage of power by October
29, 1970, and thereafter to keep payments current. It has only partly fulfilled
this obligation. The Government has paid Rp. 2.3 billion as part payment of
accounts due from Government agencies up to March 31, 1971. The Bureau of the
Budget and PLN has agreed that the balance of the arrears, Rp. 3.4 billion be
offset by equivalent payments from the budget allocation to PLN for the fiscal
year 1971-72.  During negotiations it was agreed that confirmation by indepen-
dent auditors that arrears for the Government fiscal year ending March 31, 1972
of Rp. 2.4 billion and accounts to the end of 1972 had been paid in cash, would
be a condition of disbursement for the procurement of equipment (although not
of services).
4.08      The method of processing for payment current billings of Government
Departments was agreed during negotiations.  Commencing with the Government
fiscal year 1972-73 PLN will render bills the first week of each month. The
Departments concerned would be provided by Government with funds to pay the
bills by the middle of that month. Should the budget allocation to the
department prove insufficient to pay them, the Ministry of Finance would
settle the amounts due.
Future Financial Position
4.09      The financial forecasts must be regarded as only indicative, given
the wide range of assumptions and the uncertain nature of PLN's growth,
accounting and development. Notwithstanding, it appears that during the
period 1972-76, PLN should be able to achieve full coverage of its operating
costs including depreciation, if tariff levels are increased as described and
other costs maintained in the order shown (para. 4.13). This is a reasonable
target for PLN to aim at. Beyond 1976, PLN should commence to be in a position
to finance a substantial portion of the development program from profits.
4.10      The detailed financial statements for the period 1972-80, using the
1970 and 1971 statements as a base, are shown in Annex 9.  The major assumptions
are an annual sales increase of 10% up to 1975 and 14% thereafter (para. 2.16)
and tariff adjusBtments of 25% each on January 1, 1973, and January 1, 1975.
Operating Expenses
4.11      PLN should thoroughly examine operating costs, particularly fuel,
labor and maintenance. Cost reduction should be possible through more
efficient use of material, better control of inventories and better operating
procedures. PLN agreed to have the consultants review PLN's costs and make
recommendations concerning their reduction. (Para. 5.12)
4.12      No long-term  contract exists between PLN and the National Oil Company



- 13 -
PERTAMINA. PLN has initiated discussions with PERTAMINA regarding deliveries
and type of fuel and agreed to discuss with PERTAMINA its expanding need for
fuel, including construction of new thermal plant. PLN agreed to inform
PERTAMINA of its expansion plans to enable the latter to take the fuel needs
of future plants into account in developing their production, distribution
and marketing programs.
Tariffs
4.13      Under Credit 165-IND PLN undertook to implement new tariffs in
accordance with the consultants' recommendations by February 1, 1973. The
consultants are expected to complete their tariff recommendations by mid-1972,
a preliminary study having indicated the possible necessity of 25% increases
in January 1973 and January 1975. During negotiations PLN undertook to
introduce by January 1, 1973 new tariffs based on the consultants' recommen-
dations and with the agreement of the Association.
4.14      On the basis of the recommendations emanating from PLN's tariff
study, an appropriate earnings test for PLN is to be devised, as agreed by
the Association and PLN. It will provide revenues from operations to cover
all operating expenses including depreciation, taxes and interest, and to
finance a reasonable portion of PLN's capital expenditure.
Financing Plan
4.15      Based on the investment program approved by the Government for the
project construction period 1972-76, and the financial forecast (para. 4.09),
a tentative financing plan for PLN has been prepared by the consultants,
summarized as follows:

The estimated net internal cash generation for the period 1972-76 would
provide funds equivalent to 17% of the investment program, roughly equal to
50% of the funds generated by depreciation.
4.16      The foreign credits available or in prospect are listed in Annex 6.
Although as in the case of the financial forecast, the financial plan is more
indicative than firm, it provides a basis to initiate long-term financial
planning. In view of the subatantial need for borrowings on probably conven-
tional terms, the Government will pass the proceeds of the proposed credit
on to PLN as equity, to keep future debt in line with PLN's ability to service
it.
1/ Total interest and amortization less interest charged to construction.
2/ Includes interest charged to construction.



- 15 -
4.17      The Government has also advised that all Government contributions for
the project should be treated as equity capital. The present thinking of the
Government is that all other external borrowings by Government for PLN and
Association credits subsequent to the proposed credit should be reloaned to
PLN.
4.18      In accordance with the provisions of the new Charter, PLN would each
year prepare a detailed forecast of its annual capital expenditure requirements,
and a source and application of fundsl plan to show internal, Government and
other sources of funds. This is especially important since PLN will be reliant
on Government contributions for its development program. The Government has
agreed to establish the annual budget appropriation for PLN, and earmark monthly
payments to it, on the basis of PLN's submission. As in the case of the Govern-
ment agencies, any shortfall would be made up by a supplemental appropriation in
the next year's budget.
Audit
4.19      Under Credit 165-IND PLN have agreed to have its accounts audited
annually by independent auditors acceptable to the Association commencing
the first full year following the valuation of assets. This requires an
audit of the accounts for 1973 and subsequent years. During negotiations
it was agreed that certified statements and the auditor's report would be
furnished to the Association not later than 6 months after the end of PLN's
fiscal year. PLN also agreed to furnish with the auditor's report an opinion
as to whether amounts owed PLN for electricity supplied during the fiscal
year to any Government Department or agency had been fully paid in cash.

V. THE PROJECT
5.01     Credit 165-IND wan intended to finance the first two years of a five-
year program for the rehabilitation and expansion of Djakarta's distribution
system. It was realized that the project as then formulated and, indeed,
the general approach to system expansion would be subject to modification
following a review of system requirements, planning policies, standards of
service and design practices by the engineering consultants.
The Project
5.02     This review has now been ccmpleted by SOFRJELEC and a five-year
expansion program through 1975 formulated by PLN with the guidance of SOFRELEC.
The proposed IDA Credit of $40 million would, together with the $15 million
provided under Credit 165-IND, finance the 5-year program for the cost of
equipment and supplies for the rehabilitation of the distribution system, and
its expansion in Djakarta, and the strengthening of the high-voltage trans-
mission ring around it.  Included in the Association financing are the conti-
nuation of the engineering consulting services for the project and consulting
services for management and operational improvement of PLN (para. 5.08 - 5.12).
5.03     Primary distribution will be rehabilitated and expanded; the voltage
will be standardized at 20 kV - with a gradual phasing out of existing 12 kV
and 7 kV circuits. The secondary distribution system will be rehabilitated
and expanded and a standard voltage of 220/380 volts will be established
instead of the existing predcminantJe/127/220 volts facilities, referred to
hereafter as the voltage changeover.-  The 70 kV transmission ring around
Djakarta will be reinforced to provide an adequate supply to the main sub-
stations.
5.04     Credit 165-IND and the proposed credit would finance 600 kns of
20 kV primary distribution underground cable, equipment for 130 kms of 20 kV
primary distribution overhead lines, about 360,000 kVA of distribution trans-
formers for the rehabilitation of 160 existing distribution substations and
the construction of 750 new ones, the associated secondary distribution
circuits, poles, meters and switchgear, and the cost of change or modification
to consumer's apparatus due to the change in the secondary distribution
voltage.
5.05     The capability of the distribution system on completion of the project
will be:
Transformer oapacity, 70 kV to primary
distribution                             540 MVA
Primary distribution                           740 MVA
Transformer capacity to secondary distri-
bution                                   130 MVA
Secondary distribution capacity                220 MVA (with 7% voltage
drop requirement)
1/  This choice was based on oonsultants studies made some years ago.  It was
confirmed by PLN's present consultants and the Govermnent issued a
regulation on standardizing the 220/380 volt system.



- 17 -
This is a well-balanced installation taking into consideration the necessity
of installing adequately-sized primary capacity to enable future growth to be
supplied from additional installations of distribution transformers and
feeders. The plans appear to be well based and consistent with raising the
quality of service to a level which would assure reliability of supply and
maintenance of voltage levels to the extent that oummercial and industrial
firms would be encouraged to obtain their power requirements from PLN, rather
than install their own diesel-electric generators (para. 2.05, 6.01).
Cost Estimate
5.06     The project cost estimate given in Annex 11 and summarized below was
prepared by the engineering consultants with the assistance of PLN. It reflects
the recent international monetary adjustments. Contingencies of about 11%
foreign and 15% local are included for physical changes in the project. Con-
tingencies for price escalation have been included at 8% for imported goods
and 10% for local works corresponding to about anmual price increases of 5%
for foreign and 6% for domestic items. The estimate in oonsidered reasonable.

Amount of Proposed Credit
5.07     The proposed credit would be US$40 million equivalent, the difference
between the foreign exchange cost of the Project of US$55 million equivalent
and the US$15 million provided under Credit 165-IND. The proposed credit
together with the US$15 million provided by Credit 165-IND would represent
about 75 percent of the project's total cost. The high percentage is due to
the large amount included for consulting services and the setting up of
training establishments, the fact that almost all equipment must be imported,
and the low cost of the Indonesian labor ccmponent. The amounts financed
under Credit 165-IND and the proposed credit would be as follows:

Engineering and Construction
5.08     Consulting engineers would continme to be employed for the system
rehabilitation and expansion, including planning, voltage change-over,
training for oonstruction and the voltage change-over, preparation of bid
documents and evaluation of bids, and to coordinate and supervise construction
and installation. With the enlarged scope of the project an amount of US$2.8
million is included in the proposed credit to cover a continuation of the
services of engineering consultants, in¢luding training (para. 5.11). PLN
agreed during negotiations to continue to employ consultants for
engineering and management consulting for the project under Terms of Reference
which include ths above project engineering responsibilities, and on terms ar-3
conditions acceptable to the Association.  (Activities under management
consulting are covered in paragraph 5.12).
5.09     Planning for the project under Credit 165-IND has generally been
completed, including the preparation of most bid documents. Orders for about
US$3 million have been comnitted under Credit 165-IND. Deliveries should
commence in the last quarter of 1972. The purchase of all equipment for the
proposed project and installation will extend through the end of 1975.
5.10     PLN has heretofore carried out installation and construction of dis-
tribution facilities with its own forces. However, in view of the much
larger size of the Project than any previous work of PLN it is necessary to
provide appropriate training of PLN's labor force and to provide foreign
expertise for construction supervision. Appropriate funds are included in the
proposed credit for this purpose. Whether this arrangement will prove satis-
factory will be determined by the results experienced in the first area of
Djakarta in which the installation work is to be carried out, beginning in
the last quarter of 1972. If necessary PLN's forces would be supplemented by
those of local electrical contractors, of whom there are a number, for subsequent
work. During negotiations PLN agreed to have construction and installation
of the project works carried out under arrangements and conditions satisfactory
to the Association.
Training Centers for Voltage Change-over
5.11     The Borrower, with the assistance of the consultants, has established
a training unit for the voltage change-over scheme. The proposed credit
includes funds for the cost of the foreign experts provided by the consultants
for this work.



- 19 -
Management Consulting Services
5.12      The proposed credit included US$3.6 million equivalent for a conti-
nuation of management consulting services. These services, outlined in Annex
8, would cover (i) a training program for PLN personnel by foreign experts in
the fields of accounting, power plant operation, inventory practices and
administrative procedures;(ii)  an extensive study of operating costs; (iii)
the planning of more permanent training policies and programs; and (iv) direct
advisory assistance on organization, general management, system planning,
finance and accounting. Extensive management and training services of this
nature are essential if PLN is to become an efficient utility (para. 1.05).
During negotiations PLN agreed to have its consultants undertake the above
work under appropriate terms of reference, acceptable to the Aasociation. It
also agreed to arrangements for the prompt implementation of the recommendation
of the consultants arising from their management consulting work (para. 3.14).
Procurement
5.13      Indonesian factories are being established to manufacture distribution
transformers and cables. As in Credit 165-IND, the proposed credit would provide
that local manufacturers would be permitted to participate in the bidding for
IDA financed goods with a margin of preference of 15%. For the purpose of bid
comparison, the 15% preference or actual duties levied, whichever is lower, would
be added to the CIF landed cost of imported equipment. Procurement of goods
financed by the credit would be on the basis of international competitive bidding
except for spare parts and ccmponents of equipment needed for replacement,
estimated to cost about US$1.0 million equivalent, for which such bidding would
be impractical.
Disbursements
5.14      Disbursements would be made for the full foreign exchange cost of the
equipment imported and the services provided as described in paragraph 5.06,
and for awards to local manufacturers for the full ex-factory price. Disburse-
ments would generally not be made from the proposed credit until the proceeds
of Credit 165-IND have been completely utilized or otherwise committed. The
schedule of disbursements is given in Annex 12. Any funds remaining undisbursed
on completion of the loan would be cancelled.
5.15      Capital works of Government Departments and Agencies financed by
budgetary provisions or foreign aid are exempt from custom duties. In any case,
the possible effect of preferential duties on the evaluation of bids does not
arise as Indonesia does not belong to any trading bloc granting preference.
Ecology
5.16      No ecological problems arise in connection with the Project.  Primary,
and main secondary distribution circuits will be underground, as are present
facilities; secondary feeders and service connections would be generally over-
head as it would be prohibitive in cost to do otherwise for the low density
domestic supply situation in Djakarta.

VI. JUSTIFICATION OF THE PROJECT
6.01      As elsewhere in Indonesia, the situation in Djakarta, the project
area, is characterized by a very low prevalence of electric service (one
consumer for about 40-45 inhabitants). The quality of power service is very
poor and commercial and industrial uae is low. Many industries generate their
own power because of the poor aervice and/or inability to obtain a supply from
PLN, lacking adequate distribution facilities. With the present distribution
system little or no additional power could be supplied and commercial and
industrial development would be largely halted. The project is of high
priority, therefore.
Loan Forecast
6.02      The consultants have estimated the load growth in Djakarta through
1980 by (i) using as a starting basis trends based on historical data (making
adjustments as necessary for varying trends in different categories); and
(ii) taking into account, for each consumer class, the probable change in
consumption pattern and saturation rate. Two alternative forecasts have been
prepared for the Djakarta area corresponding to a low or a high rate of power
system development, details of which are given in Annex 13 and summarized
below:
Load Forecast - Djakarta
Sales (GWh)          Generation (GWh)       Peak Load (MW)
1970/actual                354                   479                    94
1975/low                   662                   741                   138
1975/high                  820                   918                   169
1980/low                 1,078                 1,207                   220
1985/high                1,590                 1,780                   326
To derive the above figures the connection rate of domestic consumers has been
assumed at 5.8% annually (1967-69 trend) and 10% in the low and high cases
respectively, while the consumption per domestic consumer has been assumed to
increase about 4% a year. The ratio of domestic to commercial sales has been
assumed to remain constant. For industry, two trends are used for the average
consumption per consumer and an assumption is made that by 1980 all the demand
presently supplied by captive power facilities in Djakarta will be supplied by
Exploitasi XII. If the latter were not the case, however, only the 1980 fore-
cast would be significantly changed, not the 1975 forecast. Since much of the
load growth would result from extending the supply to new consumers and by a
higher utilization by existing ones, not now possible because of the lack of
distribution facilities, the accuracy of the forecasts will depend upon the
rate at which the system can be rehabilitated and strengthened. However,
provided that the project is implemented as proposed, the load in 1975 should
not be less than the low forecast and there is a good possibility that the
higher forecast will be achieved. The annual growth rates for sales over the
1970-1975 period average 13.5% and 18.3% respectively in the low and high
cases. The approach used by the consultants and the results obtained are
appropriate.



- 21 -
Generating Capacity
6.03     Generating capacity now in operation or under construction will be
sufficient to meet the forecast power requirements of Djakarta through 1975.
The 2 -50 MW units under installation at the Priok thermal power plant are
expected to be commissioned in 1972/73 (Annex 6), and a sixth 25 KW unit at
the Djatiluhur hydroelectric plant is expected to be in service in 1974.
Internal Economic Return
6.Q4     The internal economic return (Axmex 14) is the discount rate at which
the present worth of costs attributable to the project including the cost of
generating the additional consumption and losses (net of duties and taxes) is
equal to that of the benefits derived from it. Using 1971 sales as a starting
point, and the median of the high and low sales forecasts, the additional
sales attributable to the project by 1976, when it is expected to be in full
commission is estimated to be 422 GWh. In pricing labor, actual wage scales
have been used as in the context of the Indonesian economy there is no reason
or basis for shadow pricing of construction labor. The internal economic
return is expected to be at least 18% on the basis of electricity tariffs used
in preparing the financial forecasts.
6.05     Although the above return has been calculated on the financial
benefits which will accrue from the project as proposed, it is understated in
view of the additional but non-quantifiable benefits that would be derived
from the improved quality of service to present and future consumers and from
the fact that the system has necessarily been designed with primary and secon-
dary capacities which will enable growth beyond 1976 to be supplied by the
additional installation of distribution transformers and feeders.
6.06     It is evident from the previous chapters that the uncertainties
which attend forecasts of PLN's development and growth make risk calculations
less meaningful than in more normal utility circumstances. In PLN's case the
likelihood of the cost of the project being exceeded is small but operating costs
could readily be 30% higher as the result of larger than assumed salary and fuel
price increases, while revenues could be as much as 20% larger if the high
rate of load growth in Djakarta should obtain. The result would be to reduce
the internal economic return to 17% in the former case and to increase it to
21% in the latter.

VII. AGRED4ENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      During negotiations, assurances were obtained that:
(a)  The Association would be given the opportunity to comment on the
qualifications of nominees to fill the post of President Director
(para. 3.08);
(b)  PLN will implement the consultants' recommendations for improved
methods and systems within three months following their review
with the Association (para. 3.14);
(c) the Government would pay PLN's arrears for electricity supplied
to Government institutions and in the future would provide sufficient
funds in proper time to keep payments current (para. 4.08);
(d)  PLN would have the consultants review costs (para. 4.11);
(e) new tariffs would be introduced by January 1, 1973, and an appro-
priate earnings test would be devised for PLN (paras. 4.13, 4.14);
(f) the Government would make an annual budget appropriation for PLN
(para. 4.18);
(g)  beginning with the accounts for 1973, PLN would have its accounts
audited annually by independent auditors (para. 4.19);
(h) engineering and management consulting engineers will continue to
be employed for the project on terms and conditions and under
Terms of Reference satisfactory to the Association (paras. 5.08,
5.12);
(i) the project would be constructed under arrangements satisfactory
to the Association (para. 5.10); and
(j) the proposals submitted by the consultants for a training and
implementation program would be undertaken by the consultants
under Terms of Reference as the Borrower and the Association shall
consider appropriate (para. 5.12).
7.02      The project would constitute a suitable basis for an IDA credit
of US$40 million.

THE POWER SECTOR AND PLN STATUS IN-1969
A review of the organization of the power sector and of PLN's
organizational and financial status was made in 1969 as part of the appraisal
of the first Djakarta Power Distribution Project (165-IND). The following
excerpts from the appraisal report (Report No. PU-18a, October 8, 1969)
describe the situation found and the main  conclusions reached:
Organization of the Sector
1.        In the period 1953-57 the three Dutch-owned electric utility
companies supplying power in Indonesia were nationalized by the Indonesian
Government. The transfer was not amicable, records were destroyed and there
was no transition period during which the new Indonesian management could have
been trained by its predecessors. During subsequent years the decline in the
efficiency of the utilities was marked by inadequate expansion and poor
operating conditions. In 1961 the three nationalized utilities were consolidated
into a single entity, the predecessor of PLN, responsible for all public electric
utility facilities in the country. In 1965, when PLN was organized, it was
relieved of the responsibility for major power construction, Which is at present
carried out under other arrangements, under the authority of the Minister of
Public Works and Power. Moreover, given the uncertainties as to fund avail-
abilities, planning, which is carried out both by offices within the Ministry
and PLN itself, has at best been haphazard.
2.        FLN is prospectively a very large utility.  Present public and
captive power generating capacity for al Indonesia is only some 7 watts per
capita, which compares, for example, with about 30 for India. Thus, use of
electric power in Indonesia is very limited and electricity usage could grow
at a very fast rate, given favorable development conditions. The public
supply's inability to meet overall requirements has given rise to a substantial
captive generating capacity, that is, generation provided by industrial and
ccmmercial enterprises for their own use.
3.        PLN is presently incapable of providing adequate electric service,
nor is there anr reason to expect that meaningful improvements in its operation
will be made without outside advice and assistanco. Among its principal weak-
nesses are the following:
(i) purchasing and contracting are outside managements'
control, with the result that expenditures ay not
be responsive to priority needs. Moreover, the
assumption of these funotions by Govermuent has
led to a deterioration of the planning function in
PLN;
(ii)  there is surplus staff; staff effioiency, pay, and
morale are low;
(iii) plant is inadequate, as are operating and maintenance
techniques and procedures;



ANNEX 1
Page 2 of 4
(iv) accounting and other records are inadequate,
information for control over operations is
lacking or not available in a timely fashion;
cozmw.iations are poor;
(v)   tariffs are possibly too low, and operating
expensoe are almost certainly too high;
collections are poor, contributing to the
finanoial conditions under which PLN appears
to operate at a loss.
These problems are discussed in the remainder of this Chapter.
4.        PLN operates under the authorization of a body of laws relating to
government agencies and enterprises in general, and a 1965 Government decree
concerning it specifically. Taken in its entirety, this body of laws appears
to convey autonomous powers to PLN. However, there are some conflicts in the
laws, and moreover, the authority of PLN in certain respects is not established
or is ill-defined.
5.        Thus the Government retains the responsibility for setting tariffs,
on the principle that their lovel is related to the general social welfare.
The abstract principle of making a profit is recognized in the 1965 decree
but it oontaina no guidelines in this connection, such as, for example, that
of a rate of return on investment.
6.        Notwithstanding the provisiona contained in the laws, PLN does not
in reality function as an autonomous body, but functions instead as a governrment
agency responsible to the Directorate General of Power, and office of the
Ministry of Public Works and Power. The Directorate General with a staff of
anginsers and administrative assistants controls the operations of ELN, and
those of the state-owned gas companxy and state construction organizations. The
Directorate General is for practical purposes the body through which the
Government administers the power sector. The actual function of PLN is
primarily that of implementing policies and administering them on a day-to-day
basis.
7.        PlN's managment has thus been relegated to a aecondary role. With
the growth of the sector, this situation will become increasingly unsatisfactory
and it is very important that the actual arrangements which now exist between
Government, the Directorate General and PLN should be put on a more sensible
basis as soon as is consistent with the capabilities of the respective
organizations and personnel. PLN should, subject to normal government
restraints, becoet autonomous with respect to setting tariff levels, procuremer.t,
construction, system planning, employment, and finance, including the raising of
funds, for the public power sector. This would likely involve some modificatio.,
and consolidation, of the laws governing FLNA, and the transfer of responsibili-.y
for the public power sector from the Directorate General to PLN.
8.        Of irmediate importance to the execution of the project itself (Fir>
Djakarta Power Distribution Project) is the situation whereby the Director
General undertakes the negotiation and execution of contracts for the purchase
of foreign equipment, responsibility for major construction and organization
of construction jobs. It would be difficult for PLN to carry out the project



ANNX 1
Page 3 of 4
effectively without a change in this situation, and in any case, transfer
of this responsibility to PLN would be an important step in making it
autonomous. Assurances have been received that as a condition of effective-
ness of the proposed credit (165- IND), PLN will be made responsible for
procurement and construction of all new projects, including that to be
financed by the proposed credit, with the exception of those now under con-
struction.  Assurances have been received, as well, that the latter will
become the responsibility of PLN not later than April 1, 1971.
PLN's Internal Organization
9.        PLN is administered by a Board of Directors of five, under  the
provisions of the 1965 decree; the President and the heads of the four main
departments. The President of the Board is responAible to the Minister of
Public Works and Power. All members of the board are appointed by the
Government.
10.       The four main departments - personnel, operations, finance and
construction - and the fourteen operating regions, report directly to the
President of the Board. It is recognized by Government and PLN that the
16,000 employee staff of PLN, built up under former Government social welfare
policies of full employment, is much in excess of actual needs.  PLN is
following a policy of reduction of staff by attrition. O#erstaffing of state
enterprises is one of the problems the Government is now considering on a
national basis and this may in itself lead to a more reasonable employment
level at PLN. The studies and recommendations of the management consultants
will be of prime importance in the future rationalization of this problesm.
11.       Region 12, the object of the expansion program under the proposed
IDA credit, is responsible for the western part of Java, including Djakarta,
which represents about 80% of the region's sales.  The largest and most
important of the 14 regions, it has 3,000 ewployees, and is characterized by
young and enthusiastic, if somewhat inexperienced, leadership. It operates
the region facilities, and prepares and executes programs of distribution
system expansion when money and equipment are made available.
12.       Aside from the difficulties arising from the role of the Directorate
General, PL,N's management is severely hampered by inadequate comunications
over the very widely spread service areas. Inadequate records, statements and
systems with which to work add significantly to the problem. Moreover, while
PLN management and superviaory personnel appear responsible and technically
qualified, they are deficient in terms of ana gent practices and modern
techniquea.
13.       Important factors in PLN's operation  as a whole are overstaffing,
weak morale, low salaries and the poor working conditions of lower level staff.
As a Government institution PLN is subject to the salary levels which apply
to Government enterprises, which are only a fraction of those paid by private
enterprises. While the salaries of higher level staff are supplemented by
such amenities as cars and houses they are still very low. Other classes of
personnel must resort to a second job. Performance at PLN suffers accordingly.



ANNEX 1
Page 4 of 4
Deficiencies in PLN'. Financial Operations
14.       There are two fundamental defects in PLN's financial operations.
PLN has been operating at a loss and, secondly, the apparatus for controlling
its finances and accounts is in a near-chaotic conditionb Probably the most
important reason for both is the political and economic situation of the pas4
decade, and its attendant inflation. Other factors include the lack of
experienced financial manageoent and staff, inability to effectively use the
accounting system, inefficient operations, overstaffing and deficiencies in
billings and collections.
15.       Under the abnormal political/economic conditions, tariff inoreasas
lagged far behind inflation and given long delays in collections, revenue was
entirely disproportionate to operating costs. The Government did not pay its
bills and collections from the ordinary consumer suffered. There was no
alternative but for PLN to operate on a day-to-day basis, trying to meet out-
of-pocket costs and whore it could not, turning to the Government for funds.
Government response to the problems of PLN was limited, given the order of
magnitude of its other problems.
16.       The flow of information concerning revenues and expenses from par-ts
of the wideapread service area was largely disrupted. Revenue and expense
accounts were distorted and tin balance sheet became meaningless in the absence
of revaluation of assets to correct for the large inflation. As noted, the
Government assumed direct responsibility for major construction and in many
instances the new facilities were not only not incorporated into PLN's asst-&-3
but the details of the agreements under which they were obtained were obsoure
or seemingly lost. This state of affairs would have been very difficult even
for an experienoed and well managed utility. In the case of PLN it was over-
whelming and there was a breakdown of the finance and accounting processes.
17.       In the past two years PLN has made some recovery but it will require
considerable time, effort and assistance to put financial operations on a
normal basis. Within several years this should be possible by means of the
management consulting assistance proposed. This is in line with the Association's
strategy which envisages a first credit under which the process of rehabilitating
PLN would be started, and assuming reasonably satisfactory results, possible
additional credits to which more conventional conditions would be attached.

SECOND ELECTRICITY DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
SUMMARY OF PROPOSED CHARTER FOR PLN (PERUM "LISTRIK NEGARA"I)
1.        The Charter is in the form of a Government Regulation decreed by the
President of the Republic  and promulgated ini the State Gazette.
2.        The main purpose of the charter is to revise the statutes of PLN as
established by Government Regulations No. 19 (1965), No. 11 (1969) and No. 30
(1970) and to replace them with the new regulation.
3.        The object of PLN is stated to be "to participate in the develop-
ment of the economy and the national resiliance pursuant to the policy of

TRAINING AND IMPLEKENTATION PROGRAM
Training
1.        An acute shortage of qualified staff and skilled personnel is one
of the main obstacles to PLN's progress.  To overcome this, priority must be
given to training.
Immediate Programs
2.        Sectorial training has already begun: system planning engineers and
accounting machine operators, for example, have received training for several
months. A fully-equipped specialized center for the instruction of technicians,
foremen and skilled laborers on the Djakarta distribution project was inaugurated
late in 1971, less than four months after the deoision was made to build it.
Next on the list of immediate requirements are programs for the
following categories of personnel:
(1) accounting staff in the implementation of major
changes in accounting and related practices;
(2) engineers, technicians and foremen of the
Tanjung-Priok steam power plant, now undergoing
a major expansion;
(3) warehouse attendants who should be instructed in
inventory practices, related to the new purchasing
guidelines and Code of Accounts; and
(4)  administrative officera who must be introduced to
the new personnel administration procedures.
These programs should be launched prior to the proposed credit becoming
effective to avoid an interruption of existing efforts.
Permanent training schemes
3.        Apart from these immediate programs, steps must be initiated to lay
the foundations of a permanent training policy and to plan facilities needed
for its implementation. The starting point should be a quantitative and
qualitative assesanent of future personnel requirements, supported by a detailed
Job description and evaluation work based on SOFRILEC's recent analysis of PLN'a
personnel data.
A first tochnical operations training center is in the advanced planning
stage and should be in operation, at Bogor, by the end of 1972. In intensive 4 to
L0 week sessions, it will train up to 400 technicians and specialized operators a
year in their respective kilUs. The Bogor center will also be equipped to give
recently recruited engineers ccaplementary training in power operations.



ANNEX 8
Page 2 of 2
A second and siuilar center is planned for completion by mid-1973 and
a third is tentatively envisaged for construction a year later. Theae two or
three basic centers and the AntJol distribution construction center should form
the physical oore of an integrated technical training function in PLN. In these
facilities, the training of instructors will be so arranged and phased as to
maximize their multiplier effect, so that a number of instructors can later be
detailed to smaller temporary or mobile training units in more remote areas, as
and when the need arises.
Simultaneously, special sessions will be held in Djakarta for junior
executives in non-technical fields, adopting the latest and most succesasful
management training programs to the specific needs and context of PLN.
Advisory assistance
4.        In the first half of the 5 to 6 yearemodernization program, the need
for a most careful coordination of advisory assistance to PLN will be parti-
cularly acute: inconsistencies or inadequate phasing could lead to wasteful
setbacks at a critical stage.
Ephasis should increasingly be placed on System Planning, on practical
operating improvuients and on the gradual introduction of new organizational
structures in a limited nmmber of geographical areas. At the same time,
attention should continue to be paid to other facets of the present assistance --
accounting, construction management, rate setting, personnel administration, etc.
Summary of consulting requirements
5.        In terms of man-months required to carry out these training and direct
asaistance programs, total consulting personnel needs from mid-1972 to the end of
1974 are estimated as follows, in addition to those covered by existing contracts
under Credit ImD-165:
Man-months
Training
Immediate programs                                 100
Permanent scheme                                   200
Direct assistance
Creation of new organizational structures          100
General Management and System Planning              70
Financial and Accounting                            40
Provision should also be made for the purchase of teaching equipment and
supplies and for the cost of special training periods for Indonesian staff abroad.
The estimated cost of these consulting services and related items is US$3.6
million equivalent.

PERUSAHAAN LISTRIK NEGARA (PLN)
Assumptions for Financial Forecasts
The following assumptions were made for the financial forecasts
1972-1980:
(i)   electricity sales would increase at the rate of 10% per annum
up to 1975 and beyond 1975 by 14%;
(ii)  tariffs would be adjusted to increase revenues by 25%
in 1973 and 1975 and a further 15% in 1978;
(iii) material costs (for maintenance) would increase at a
rate corresponding to the estimated increase in
electricity sales i.e. 10% per annum up to 1975 and
beyond 1975 by 14%;
(iv)  provision for bad debts would increase by 3% per annum
from 1971-1974, then by 1% in the following two years.
From 1977 on no provision has been made;
(v)   depreciation has been calculated on all new assets
based on an estimated life of 30 years in the absence of
any detailed information on assets. Assets in service
prior to 1972 have been depreciated at the rate cf 10%
per annum;
(vi)  an interest rate of 7% per annum has been applied to all
borrowings, and debt service has been calculated on the
basls of annuities over a period of 25 years including
five year grace. 19,2 borrowings have been treated as
Government equity since it is not expected that the
transfer of assets will be completed much before the
end of 19'2;
(vii) the Government wculd offset PLN's tax liabilities of
approximately Rps. 9 billion (US$21 million) against its
unpaid electricity bills amounting to Rps. 7 billion
(US$16.7 million);
(viii) the proposed credit from the Association would be trans-
ferred to PLN by the Government as equity; and
(ix)  all existing assets as at December 31, 19',2 would be repre-
sented by Government equity in PUL. No provision has been
made for any dividends to be fixed or declared on the equity
up to 1980.

Tari.ff 
1.        Tariff levels are determined by Government after discussions with PLN,
the result beirq,,a compromise between social-political considerations and PLN's
needs. Tariffsz- are comprised of basic schedules which are uniform throughout
Indonesia and charges for transportation of fuel which vary with regions frca
about 1/lOths of a cent to as high as 1X  cents per Nwh. For the country as a
whole the basic tariff averages about 2¼ oents per kwh, and the transportation
for fuel charge averages about 3/lOths of a cent per kwh.
2.        Tariffs were changed six times between 1963 and 1968, reflecting the
extreme inflation in Indonesia. The most recent ircreases, those of May 1, 19$8
in basic tariffs, varied considerably for different classes of service in an
attempt to improve the rate structure.
3.        The basic tariff structure favors the small consumer who pays less
per kwh than the other customers. In Region 12 the average price paid by the
domestic consumer, as the level of consumption per customer rises, increases
from about 1 cent to 3 cents per kwh, reflecting the social policy of the
Government. Industrial tariffs (including a demand charge) average about 2¼
cents per kwh and conmercial tariffs 4½ to 5 cents per kwh, the higher rate
being paid by the larger commercial customers.
4.        New customers pay heavy connection charges, a temporary measure
which varies in different regions. For industrial customers such charges
currently in effect in Region 12 are about 11 cents per VA. The charge is
about 14 cents per VA for small domestic customers and almost 30 cents per VA
for the large domostic and commercial customers. For the small domestic
customer the connection charge exceeds three years of regular bills.
1/ For convenience of interpretation price per kwh is stated in terms of
equivalent US cents.

Internal Economic Return
1.        The Internal Economic Return was computed on the rehabilitation and
expansion of the Djakarta distribution network, with a capital cost, net of
custom duties, is US$65.7 million equivalent.
2.        The internal economic return is at least the discount rate at
which the present worth of the costs of the project and other attributable
costs, net of duties and taxes, is equal to the present worth of the revenues
derived from it. The table below shows the details of computation:
