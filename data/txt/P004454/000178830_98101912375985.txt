PHILIPPINES
RURAL INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT I
1. BACKGROUND
General
1.01      The Government of the Philippines has requested Bank Group assis-
tance in financing a multi-sectoral Rural Infrastructure Project in six
provinces, which were selected on the basis of their present low level of per
capita rural income and inadequate infrastructure facilities. Project
components include communal irrigation systems, barangay (village) roads,
small ports, barangay health stations, and rural water supply. In each case
the Government has presently an ongoing program of the activities to be
financed under the project. While similar activities have been financed as
components of several previous Bank loans, this project would represent a
first Bank Group effort aimed at assisting the implementing agencies in
carrying out a relatively large program. Bank Group assistance would be
focused mainly on strengthening the technical and administrative capability
of the implementing agencies, providing additional funds to enable an expan-
sion of the programs, and introducing improved methods for selecting, eval-
uating and monitoring the development impact of these programs.
1.02      The National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) was respon-
sible for coordinating the preparation of the project, with assistance from
the FAO/World Bank Cooperative Program and the IDA (Association). The
present report is based on the findings of an appraisal mission composed of
Messrs. E.G. Giglioli, M. Saddington, L. Shanan and D.J. Steel (Association)
and A.K. Long, D.K. Jones, and W.H. Cooke (Consultants), which visited the
Philippines in April, 1977 and of a follow-up mission comprising Messrs. A.N.
Khan, L. Shanan and V. Talvadkar (Association) and W.H. Cooke, and R.Y.
Scheiner (Consultants) which visited the Philippines in October, 1977.
The Rural and Agricultural Sector
1.03      Some 31 million people or 70% of the Philippine population live
in rural areas where social services are poor, economic activities limited,
agricultural productivity low and underemployment high. The rural population
is growing at 2.7% per year, reflecting a natural increase of about 3.2% and
an annual rate of migration to the cities of 0.5%. The Government estimates
that by 1985, rural-urban migration is expected to reach 1.1% per year,
placing considerable strain on urban infrastructure and services.
1.04      Agriculture is the predominant sector in the Philippine economy,
accounting for about 30% of gross domestic product and over one-half of
total employment. Small farms provide the main income for 65% of the rural
population. Other sources of income include forestry, fishing, mining,
small-scale manufacturing and service industries. Farming is chiefly
oriented towards food grain production (60% rice and 40% corn) for domestic
consumption, while coconuts and sugar are the main export crops. Although
still by far the largest export sector, the contribution of agriculture



-2-
(including forestry) to export earnings has fallen from more than 70% in the
early 1970s to less than 60% in 1977, largely due to the rapid growth of
nontraditional manufactured exports.
1.05      Agriculture's performance was exceptionally strong in 1976 as pro-
duction increased by 7%, compared to the trend growth rate of 4.5%. Rice
and corn were both at record levels. The agricultural terms of trade
improved by 18% during the period 1970-74, declined slightly in 1975 and
recovered to the 1974 level in 1976. Domestic rice, corn and sugar prices
are largely administered, while coconut prices tend to fluctuate with the
world market. Government price intervention for rice was able to cushion
the impact on consumers of the 1972-73 crop damage and the peak world prices
of 1973-74, while at the same time allowing the farm-gate price for paddy to
rise with the trend in international prices. As a result of price adjustments
made in the last two years, domestic prices for major crops are now in line
with world prices.
1.06      Because of these favorable developments in production and prices,
the growth of rural family incomes has exceeded that of urban incomes in the
last four years. The ratio of the average rural income to the average urban
income rose from 0.48 in 1971 to 0.57 in 1975, and the share of family
incomes received by the poorest 40% of families increased from 12% to 15%
during the same period. However, about half of all rural families are below
the level required to ensure adequate nutrition and provide essentials for
accepted minimum standards of living.
1.07      In addition to raising the incomes of rice and corn farmers,
another major objective of the Government's agricultural development stra-
tegy is to achieve self-sufficiency in these two food crops. After sub-
stantial deficits in the early 1970s, the Philippines was able to satisfy
consumption needs solely from domestic production for the first time during
crop year 1976-77. Although an analysis of the reasons for this good perform-
ance is currently being carried out by Bank Group staff as part of the sector
work program for the Philippines, major factors appear to be recovery in
yields due to favorable weather and irrigation development, and an increase
in the area planted. With the continued growth of population and incomes the
demand for rice is expected to increase by about 3% annually. A continued
emphasis on irrigation and improved technology will be needed to increase
production at the same pace. Rice yields, particularly in irrigated areas,
are still below what could reasonably be achieved. To realize the full
benefits of recent large investments in irrigation greater efforts will be
needed to improve supporting services, particularly extension.
1.08      Another major Government objective is agrarian reform.  During
the five years in which the land transfer program has been in operation,
however, it has progressed more slowly than the ambitious pace originally
set for it. The program initially proceeded rapidly when it concentrated
on larger land holdings, but progress has been slower in recent years
because of the greater difficulties inherent in dealing with a large number
of medium-sized often middle-class landowners. These problems and a
shortage of trained manpower have led to delays in identifying tenanted



parcels, determining land values and providing documents required to transfer
titles. In April 1977, the Government adopted new procedures to speed field
operations. The main innovations are that instead of dealing with individual
parcels the reform will be carried out simultaneously for an entire barangay,
and that the manner of determining the value of land has changed, from mutual
agreement between landlord and tenant, to village-wide determinations accord-
ing to land category by Barangay Committees on Land Production. Although
the reform has encountered a number of difficulties in the course of imple-
mentation, it remains an important part of the Government's rural development
strategy, and worth the substantial effort that will be needed to complete it.
Rural Infrastructure
1.09      Except for some of the more developed lowland areas in Central
Luzon, rural infrastructure is inadequate. Although there is an extensive
network of barangay or feeder roads (some 50,000 km), only 20% are in good
condition while at. least 50% are in extremely bad condition and not passable
during the wet season. Local ports, which are important because of the
extensive use of inter-island shipping, are also inadequate. Performance of
existing communal irrigation systems falls far short of their potential, some
55% of the rural population has no safe and reliable drinking water supply,
and few villages have ready access to medical and family planning services.
1.10      Although national Government agencies dominate rural development
efforts, national planning frequently fails to reflect provincial and local
needs. In 1972, Government policy shifted towards increasing local partici-
pation in development planning and implementation, and Provincial Development
Councils, made up of local representatives of National and Provincial
Government agencies, were formed in each province. The capability of these
Councils, however, is still weak. Regional Development Councils and a
Cabinet Coordinating Committee for Rural Development (CCC) has been set up
under NEDA to coordinate rural development efforts.
1.11      Development to date has been concentrated in areas suited for
large-scale projects, particularly in lowland areas where arable land,
irrigation water, and markets are readily available. The Government is now
giving priority to economically isolated and depressed rural areas. Programs
include small-scale communal irrigation systems, barangay roads, cooperative
development, and supervised credit for small farmers, coordinated with
improved social services.
Component Subsectors
1.12      Communal Irrigation Systems.  About 0.9 million ha are irrigated
in the Philippines. Half of the irrigated area is served by National
Irrigation Systems, mostly larger than 1,000 ha, under the jurisdiction of
the National Irrigation Administration (NIA). The remaining areas vary from
a few to a few hundred hectares in size, are owned by 176,400 farmers
grouped into about 2,000 Irrigation Associations, and are served by 1,350
Communal Irrigation Systems. Communal systems are mostly "run-of-the-river"
projects where pumps or temporary weirs supply water from rivers which



- 4 -
usually have small catchments and limited dry season flows. Structures are
simple, sometimes primitive, and frequently damaged by floods. Communal
irrigation projects are developed as self-help schemes in which farmers
donate labor for construction and maintenance. Maintenance is seldom carried
out because of shortage of funds, organization, and machinery. Although
detailed statistics are not available, average yields for these systems
probably do not exceed 2 ton/ha, compared with 2.6 ton/ha on the national
systems. Under the NIA's ten-year irrigation development program, communal
projects represent about 14% of the target area. The Farms Systems Develop-
ment Corporation (FSDC), a Government-owned corporation, has been in charge
of implementing communal pump irrigation systems and organizing farmers into
Irrigation Service Associations (ISA). Development of communal irrigation
projects has been slow due to lack of funds, relatively small size of proj-
ects, and inability of farmers to form ISA.
1.13      Barangay Roads.  Road transportation accounts for nearly 40% of
freight movement and over 80% of passenger traffic in the Philippilles. The
road network, generally located in coastal plains and vall2ys to avoid
mountain ranges, is composed of some 100,000 km of highways and roads of
which about 30% are unsurfacied or have only a natural earth surfacing.
Less than half the villages in rural areas have direct access to roads and
movement of farm produce is initially by headloads, animal-drawn sleds and
wheeled carts. During the period 1971-75, the Department of Public
Highways (DPH) constructed or improved about 4,000 km of feeder roads at a
total cost of about P 53 million.
1.14      Transport investment continues to occupy a prominent position in
the Government's development program. During 1976-79, P 10 billion, or about
30% of the total public expenditures, will be invested in transport infra-
structure including the consitruction and maintenance of rural feeder roads.
The Bank-assisted Third Highway and planned Fourth Highway Projects include
some 500 km of minor rural roads throughout the country. In addition, the
Asian Development Bank (ADB) is expected to finance improvement of 800 km of
farm to market roads in Mindanao, while 1,300 km of provincial and feeder
roads leading from the Pan-Philippine Highway will be improved under the
Philippine-Japanese Highway Loan Supplementary Stage program. In May 1974,
Presidential Decree No. 701 '(PD 01) established the Bureau of Barangay Roads
(BBR) in DPH to accelerate the systematic construction and maintenance of
roads serving rural areas, and the 1977-81 Highway Development Program
includes the development of about 22,500 km of feeder roads.
1.15      Ports.  Water transportation is essential for the island communi-
ties of the Philippines. The naturally sheltered harbors and the efficient
movement of vessels has led to the proliferation of ports which have been
classified into 80 national ports and some 400 municipal ports. In many
cases operations in these ports have been inefficient because of poor
planning and poor management. The form of operation or degree of efficiency,
particularly of the municipal ports, depends to a large extent on the
ability of the municipality to see that port facilites are organized, port
charges collected and a suitable amount of maintenance done. An analysis of



- 5 -
commodity movements reveals that a substantial part of the trade generally
uses a combination of land and water transportation. For this reason,
efficient transportation in remote islands requires the integration of
barangay roads, district roads and nearby ports into a mutually supporting
system.
1.16      Improved overland mobility in recent years now makes it possible to
abandon redundant port facilities and to concentrate port activities in a few
selected locations, thereby realizing economies of scale. Upgrading and
rehabilitating these selected ports would reduce the turnaround times and
handling costs of ships and cargoes, and encourage the introduction of larger
and more efficient vessels in the inter-island trade. The expansion of
on-shore facilities (transit sheds for general cargo, paving and fencing open
cargo areas, cargo handling and holding facilities and other fixed installa-
tions) and services at public ports is also needed to increase the utiliza-
tion of existing port facilities.
Rural Health Services
1.17      The Government's health care delivery system run by the Department
of Health (DOH) is responsible for family planning services and nutrition as
well as basic health services. There are some 1,500 Rural Health Units (RHU)
belonging to DOH. Inadequate staff training and lack of equipment and drugs
are common reasons for the inability to provide sound services to patients.
Moreover, even this relatively large number of facilities can provide health
care and family planning services to only about a third of the rural population.
1.18      Under the first Bank-assisted Population Project (Loan 1035-PH),
this system is being restructured through retraining of all rural health
services staff and employment of about 2,400 new midwives to provide compre-
hensive health and family planning services to rural areas. At present each
midwife must cover a population of over 5,000 scattered among three or four
villages. In order to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the
program, the Government is developing a proposal for an experimental approach
in a few Provinces with the following main objectives:
(a) to capture community participation in improving its quality of life
through improved health and related services;
(b) to provide manpower at the barangay level to meet the community's
health needs; and
(c) to integrate the national nutrition, family planning and health
service programs at the barangay level.
1.19      The major responsibility for carrying out the program would fall
upon a Barangay Health Worker directly supervised by the rural health midwife
trained under the First Population Project. His functions would include
the health-related and family planning activities. The program would also
capitalize on community resources and involvement at the village level. For

the most part the services provided would be aimed at infants, children,
pregnant women and lactating mothers in an effort to reduce maternal and
child mortality and morbidity and increase the use of family planning
services. The focal point for these services would be the Barangay Health
Station (BHS), a small, simple health outpost to house records, supplies and
morning clinic sessions.
1.20      Village Water Sugply.  Less than half of the 31 million people
living in rural areas have safe domestic water, generally supplied from
either springs or wells. P'oor design, low standards of construction and lack
of maintenance have reduced the efficiency of these systems and many have
been abandoned. Construction is subsidized by the national Government, but
the recipient community donates labor for construction and takes care of
operation and maintenance. Rural wells are normally designed to serve
250-300 persons. They are fitted with hand pumps, have no distribution
systems and cost about P 1CIO-300 per capita (compared with P 750 for urban
systems). In the last four years, about 2,000 wells and springs, serving
almost a million people, have been constructed, but accomplishments have
fallen short of expectations because of lack of equipment, budget and staff.
1.21      The Government aims, during the next 25 years, to rehabilitate or
construct new water supply systems for about 60% of the rural population
who are inadequately served at present. A recent sector study by the World
Health Organization (WHIO) and the Bank Group pointed out the constraints
preventing the Government from initiating this program. These constraints
include inadequate national and provincial administrative capability, absence
of defined provincial policies and priorities, and lack of awareness of the
technical limitations of agencies involved in providing rural water supplies.
The Barangay Water Project, initiated recently by the Department of Local
Government and Community Development (DLGCD), in close cooperation with USAID
and WHO, is trying to overcome these constraints in the context of a program
concentrating on the larger villages of 28 selected provinces. Many small,
isolated rural communities lie outside the scope of this project and must
still rely on their respective local governments for support. Since most of
them do not have adequate resources to pursue desired programs, the national
Government must take a lead in providing the necessary inputs for these
small villages.
Project Formulation
1.22      In formulating the project, each agency reviewed its ten-year
development program (1977-86) and identified schemes to meet the immediate
need of the population. Irrigation schemes were evaluated on the basis of
land and water resources, wishes of the farmers to participate and preli-
minary cost of development; barangay roads were selected according to
potential production area, need, preliminary field surveys of alignment and
cost; ports, according to alternative means of transportation and cost of
improvement; rural health stations, according to the location of rural
health units and their distance to the villages to be served; and water
supply, according to the neied of small villages. Based on this preliminary
evaluation, detailed feasibility studies were carried out for irrigation

systems which covered 25% of the project area and were representative of
terrain, soils and type of diversion. Cost estimates of the road component
were based on three road segments representing the terrain, and 11 segments
for potential production area. Plans and detailed cost estimates were
prepared for each port, barangay health station and the equipment for rural
water supply.
1.23      This would be the third Bank Group-assisted rural development
project in the Philippines. The others are the Rural Development Project
(Mindoro) (Loan 1102-PH), and the Rural Development (Land Settlement) Project
(Loan 1421-PH). The Mindoro project is similar to the proposed project with
components for communal irrigation, provincial roads and upgrading of a port.
Progress was slow in the early stages due to inadequate budgeting by the
various agencies. Adequate budgets have been provided during the current
fiscal year, so all works are expected to be implemented rapidly. The loan
for the land settlement project became effective on October 27, 1977, so the
project is in its early stages of mobilization.
1.24      The communal irrigation and barangay road components would together
contribute to increasing agricultural production and farm income. The three
ports proposed for rehabilitation would serve as important points of entry
for the provinces concerned and would complement the barangay road develop-
ment. The health stations, and village wells would contribute to raising the
standard and quality of life for the small villages. While the project
concentrates on infrastructure, other components necessary for rural develop-
ment, such as credit, improved extension services and rural electrification,
are at present, or would be in the future, handled under separate projects.
The great need to assist the rural sector is supported both by the Government
and the Bank Group, and during the implementation of the proposed project the
Government would prepare for Bank Group financing a proposal for implementing
a similar project in an additional ten low-income provinces.
2. THE PROJECT AREAS
General
2.01      The following six provinces, which are located in four out of the
Philippines twelve regions, would be covered by the project works: Abra
(Region 1) and Kalinga-Apayao (Region 2) in Northern Luzon; Aklan, Antique
and Capiz on Panay island in the Western Visayas (Region 6); and Bohol
(Region 7) in the Central Visayas (Map 13274). Due to their mountainous
terrain, Abra and Kalinga-Apayao are sparsely populated, but the other four
provinces, particularly Bohol, are densely settled. Rice is the major crop
of all the provinces, corn is also important in Bohol, Abra and Antique,
sugarcane in Capiz, coconuts in Bohol and Aklan, while coffee is a newly
developing crop in Kalinga-Apayao. Except for Kalinga-Apayao, the provinces
are among the poorest in the Philippines with average family incomes below
the national average. Mining enterprises in Kalinga-Apayao increase the
average income. In all provinces, existing infrastructure is insufficient to
serve the population, and most of it requires rehabilitation. General
statistical data for each province are shown in Table 2.1.

Climate
2.02      The climate in the project areas is tropical and monsoonal.  Warm
temperatures throughout the year allow a twelve-month growing seas4in with
irrigation. The average annual rainfall in the provinces varies between about
1,500 mm in Bohol to 2,000-2,500 mm in the other provinces and the rainfall
distribution patterns differ markedly. In Abra, Antique and southern Kalinga-
Apayao the six winter and spring months (November-April) are dry, while the
summer and fall months are wet. In northern Kalinga-Apayao, Aklan, Capiz and
north-eastern Bohol the dry season is shorter and lasts only one to three
months; in south-western Bohol, rainfall is spread throughout the year with
the heaviest rainfall in October-November. The rainfall, together with river
flows in the wet season, is generally adequate for a single rice crop. Dry
season cropping, however, entails a greater risk and irrigation is essential
to ensure a crop. Typhoons which damage crop production are more prevalent
in Abra and Kalinga-Apayao than in the other four provinces. Although these
northern provinces average some two typhoons per year, typhoon damage is
usually localized, and not necessarily spread throughout the whole province.
Climatological data in a summarized form are given in Table 2.2.
Topography and Soils
2.03      Abra and Kalinga-Apayao are adjacent landlocked provinces with
mountainous, rugged topography, and only some 5% of their area is arable.
Agriculture is concentrated in major river valleys, the Abra river in Abra,
and the Abulog and Chico rivers in Kalinga-Apayao. Aklan and Antique are
mountainous with around 15% of their area arable.  Aklan, in the northwest
corner of Panay island, has a broad lowland area bounded in the south and
west by continuous mountain ranges, while Antique is a narrow strip of land
occupying the island's west coast, and consists of small lowland pockets
interspersed with rockspurs descending from the western highlands towards
the coast.  Capiz, situated in the island's northeast quarter, has 29% of
its area arable, with agriculture concentrated mainly in the wide northern
plains of the Panay river's extensive delta. Bohol is generally mountainous
and slopes abruptly into the sea, with rough terrain broken by deep gullies
and gorges of limestone formations. Eighteen percent of the island is
arable. These areas are found in the narrow coastal plain and in alluvial
lowlands, open valleys and rolling landscapes of the island. Four rivers,
the Inabanga and Ipil to the north and the Lobor and Abatan to the south,
drain the island.
2.04      The soils in each province may be grouped into three general
categories: plain and valley soils; intermediate upland soils; and soils of
the hills, mountains and miscellaneous land types (swamps, beach sands,
riverwash and stonyland). Table 2.3 summarized from soil survey reports of
the Bureau of Soils shows the percentage of each province's area falling into
these categories. Clays and clay loams of various types predominate in
the mountains, hills and lowlands of Abra and Kalinga-Apayao. Kalinga-Apayao
also has large areas of sandy loams, where the lowland soils are suitable for
rice cultivation, while corn, coffee, upland rice and vegetables are grown on
the mountain slopes and upland soils. In Antique, lowland soils are mainly

sandy loams while clays and clay loams, formed mostly from stratified rocks,
predominate in the mountains and hills. Capiz and Aklan soils include recent

Population, Farm Size and Land Tenure
2.05      About 2.1 million people live in the six provinces, with 36% of
them residing in Bohol, the most populous province. Kalinga-Apayao and Abra,
the two least populated areas, contain only 15% of the population. Almost
87% of the people live in rural areas, while only 13% live in urban areas.
Annual population growth rates vary from 5.2% in Kalinga-Apayao to 1.5% in
Bohol. Migration into Kalinga-Apayao, and out of Bohol, cause these extreme
variations from the country's average growth rate of 3% per year.
2.06      Since 1972, Government has pursued a program of agrarian reform
aimed at the transfer of land ownership to rice and corn tenant farmers.
Presidential Decree No. 27 (PD 27), the basic legislation of the new agrarian
reform program, provides for transferring ownership to sharecropper and
leaseholder tenants of up to 3 ha irrigated or 5 ha rainfed rice or corn
land. According to PD 27, a landlord may retain up to 7 ha if he tills the
soil himself. Since there are some 2 million rice and corn farmers on about
4 million ha, of which less than 1 million ha are irrigated, there is little
prospect of achieving the 3 ha irrigated and 5 ha rainfed objectives.
Furthermore, some 85% of the landlords have holdings of less than 7 ha and
there are no firm plans at present for transfer of these lands. In 1975 the
Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) issued transfer certificates to tenants
on all land holdings over 24 ha, and Government is now proceeding with the
transfer of land in holdings between 7 and 24 ha. In October 1976, Government
modified PD 27 to include holdings of less than 7 ha, belonging to landowners



- 12 -
with more than 7 ha of other agricultural land, or belonging to landowners
with residential, commercial or urban land from which they derive adequate
incomes. At present the number of landlords and tenants affected by the new
legislation is not known. About 7,600 land transfer certificates were issued
by DAR for about 8,500 ha in six provinces by June 30, 1976.
2.07      According to the 1971 Census of Agriculture, there are 166,000 farms
in the six provinces occupying about 426,000 ha. Table 2.4 shows the farm
size distribution and average farm size for each province. Rice and corn farms
represent about 67% of all the farms and 57% of the farm area of these six
provinces. The average size of rice farms, representing 60% of the farmers
and 51% of the area, ranges from 1.5 ha in Abra to 2.5 ha in Kalinga-Apayao
and Capiz.

Existing Irrigation Facilities
2.09      About 51,600 ha in the six provinces are served by national, communal
and private irrigation systems, details of which are summarized in Table 2.6.
National irrigation systems are generally systems with areas larger than
1,000 ha which are built, operated and maintained by the National Irrigation
Administration (NIA). Communal irrigation systems are generally about 100-
300 ha which are organized on cooperative lines into Irrigation Systems Asso-
ciations (ISAs). The systems are built by NIA who is paid by the beneficiaries
through the Farm Systems Development Corporation (FSDC). After the completion
of construction, communal systems are operated by ISAs. Private irrigation
systems are smaller usually less than 100 ha, generally irrigated by pumps
and are built and operated by private individuals.

Existing Road Facilities
2.10      There are about 8,700 km of roads in the six provinces classified
as national, provincial, municipal and barangay roads (Table 2.7). About 20%
of these roads are national roads, which are built and maintained by the
Department of Public Highways (DPH). A survey conducted by DPH in 1976
indicated that about two thirds of these roads are in fair to bad condition,
generally due to neglect of maintenance. The provincial roads, accounting
for about 27% of total road network are built by the provincial governments
(under DLGCD) which are also responsible for their maintenance with the aid
of a Government subsidy covering about two thirds of the total maintenance
costs. About 80% of the provincial roads are considered in fairly bad
condition and require considerable rehabilitation. Since 1968, USAID has
provided financial and technical assistance under the Provincial Development
Assistance Program (PDAP) to develop planning and implementing capabilities
in certain selected provinces. Under the Fourth Highway Project, provision
would be made for technical assistance to DLGCD to improve planning, detailed
engineering and construction supervision at the provincial level under PDAP.
The municipal roads, which are built and maintained by the concerned munici-
palities account for about 6% of the total road network. The municipalities
receive from Government financial assistance amounting to one third of the
maintenance cost.  About 40% of the municipal roads are in good condition.
The remaining 47% of the road network is classified as barangay roads, 20% of
which is considered in good condition. Due to poor surfacing and inadequate
cross drainage structures, many segments of these roads are impassable during
the wet season.

2.11      The Bureau of Barangay Roads (BBR) was established under
Presidential Decree No. 702 (PD No. 702) in May 1975 to accelerate the sys-
tematic construction and maintenance of roads servicing rural areas. Before
the promulgation of PD 702, no central funds were available for the mainte-
nance of barangay roads, which were the responsibility of Barangay councils.
Maintenance was carried out by manual labor recruited by the Barangay



- 15 -
Captains, and in most instances maintenance standards were poor. Since the
establishment of BBR, the benefits from increased budgetary allocations
(although still inadequate), and some organized maintenance work, are becom-
ing apparent. As a large proportion of existing barangay roads is often
impassable in the wet season due to poor surfacing and flooding, and as
agriculture is the mainstay of these provinces, improvement of these roads
is essential for rural development.
Ports
2.12      There are 31 ports in four of the six project provinces that have
access to the sea. Aklan is served by four municipal ports; Antique and
Capiz are each served by one national and one municipal port; and there are
about 21 ports scattered around the island of Bohol, but only four of these
ports have a significant volume of traffic, the rest having minimal trade
activities and being largely abandoned. The national port of Tagbilaran is
foremost among the island's ports. Many of the existing minor ports in the
project provinces operate inefficiently because of initial poor planning,
lack of maintenance and inefficient management. Most facilities require
basic rehabilitation and improvements. Five ports were identified by the
Government for improvement under the Project. Two municipal ports in Bohol
have been excluded from the Project because of their close distance to
Tagbilaran, the major port of the island. The remaining three ports are
among the five major ports of Panay Island and are located within or close to
the capital cities of Aklan, Antique and Capiz Provinces. Culasi Port in
Capiz Province built in 1935 is in poor condition and needs frequent dredging.
In recent years, there has been a substantial increase in fishing activities
requiring a new fish terminal to absorb the traffic. San Jose de Buena Vista
Port built in 1968 is located in the capital town of Antique Province and is
the only port handling shipping in the western coast of Panay Island. During
the southwest monsoons strong wave action curtails the port's activities for
about five months. The construction of a breakwater would provide a suffi-
ciently sheltered basin area and convert the port into an all-weather port.
The improvement of Dumaguit would provide the province of Aklan an alternate
port with ample space for future expansion.
2.13      These ports serve small vessels with a length ranging from 30 to
70 m. Reliable traffic data are not available, data summarized in Table 2.8
are based on spot checks made in 1975/76. The estimated traffic expected to
pass through these ports by 1985 is based on the present and projected data
of agricultural production and general merchandise. The Bank Group's sector
policy for the Philippines advocates concentration of port activities in a
few selected locations and improving the major road network. According to
this policy, the increased traffic should be handled by Iloilo port. This
would require the cargo to be moved on coastal mountainous roads for
100-200 km distance. Although the roads are classified as national roads
they are in poor condition due to neglected maintenance. These ports are of
major importance to the economy of each province and serve its rural population
whose interregional connection and lifeline for transportation as well as
marketing is based on them. The Government considers these ports essential
to the regional and provincial rural development. The works included under
the project are in the nature of restoration and provide for such basic needs
as storage area, water and electricity at a minimum investment.

Barangay Health Stations
2.14      Rural Health Units (RHU) are being improved and I)uilt throughout
the Philippines under a Bank-assisted Population Project (Loan 1035-PH) to
serve municipalities with populations of 5,000 to 50,000. Barangay Health
Stations (BHS) serve villages with populations of less than 5,000, and are
manned by a midwife and supported by the nearby RHU. At present there are
97,99, 123 and 116 RHUs in Region 1, 2, 6 and 7 respectively. Under the
proposed project, 60 barangay health stations would be built, which would
complement the rural health units built or improved under the population
project.
Rural Water Supply
2.15      An ongoing barangay water program is administered under the Pro-
vincial Development Assistance Program (PDAP). This Program, developed
jointly by the Department of Local Government and Community Development
(DLGCD) and US Agency for International Development (AID), includes 28
provinces. The program at present is limited to serve villages of 300 to
5,000 inhabitants, but will eventually cover villages and towns of up
to 30,000 people. In order to complement this program, and to provide water
supply to rural areas not covered by this program, the water supply component
would provide facilities to serve mostly villages of less than 300 inhabi-
tants and a few with up to 400 inhabitants.

240 km of existing barangay roads; construction of about
290 km of new access roads to serve the proposed communal
irrigation systems, and of about 40 km of access roads to
serve the proposed barangay health stations in Abra and
Kalinga-Apayao provinces; and
(ii) engagement of a highway engineer and consulting firms to
assist with detailed engineering, design, supervision of
construction and maintenance of the project roads.

(ii)  procurement of medical equipment, furniture, supplies and
minor instruments for the proposed health stations.
(e)  Rural Water Supply
(i) procurement of drilling equipment and materials for the
construction of about 300 wells; and
(ii)  provision for training and strengthening of the existing
staff of the Bureau of Public Works (BPW) at the center
and in the six project provinces.
The project would also make provision for the preparation of a future rural
infrastructure project in ten provinces to be selected by the Government.

Communal Irrigation Systems
3.02      Project Works.  The project would provide for the construction
of some 53 new irrigation systems ranging in size from 50 to 1,100 ha and
serving about 8,500 ha, and the rehabilitation of two systems serving about
900 ha. All systems would be served by gravity irrigation mostly based on
run-of-the-river supply, except for two systems in Bohol with proposed
impounding reservoirs. Thirty-eight systems would have diversion weirs and
the remaining 15, located on larger streams, would be served with only an
intake structure without a diversion weir. A breakdown of systems proposed
for inclusion in the project is presented in Annex 1 and summarized below:

Capiz                    6                  1,200           400             133

3.03      The diversion weir would normally be an ogee shape spillway with
crest 1.0 m to 2.0 m high above the stream bed, gated sluiceway and gated
intake works. It would be designed to pass a discharge approximately twice
the discharge capacity of thes stream channel (25-year frequency). The gated
intake structure would be a constant head orifice turnout for structures
with a capacity equal to or 'Less than 1.0 cu m/sec. A measuring device would
be provided for intake structures with capacities greater than 1.0 cu m/sec.
The conveyance system would consist of an unlined earth canal with a provision
for lining in portions with erosive soils. For effective control of water
deliveries, check structures and gated turnouts would be provided. For
smaller systems of areas less than 100 ha the main canal would also serve as a
distribution channel. For larger systems, if required, secondary unlined
canals would be provided. The proposed level of on-farm distribution is
similar to that being implemented in other Bank Group-assisted projects. The
main farm ditch serving a rotational area of about 30-50 ha would be built
under the project. Gravel surfaced O&M roads 3.5 m wide with 15 cm thick
surfacing would be built along all main canals. Access roads to and within
the systems would be built under the barangay road component of the project.
Systems with drainage problems would be provided with outlet and main or
secondary drains; farm drainage in most systems would be from field to field.



- 19 -
3.04      Status of Engineering.  Preliminary project planning studies,
designs and estimates were carried out by the Project Development Department
(PDD) of NIA. Since only limited data are available for the proposed systems,
ten representative systems accounting for about 2,400 ha or 25% of the total
area were studied in detail. The studies included surveys of the proposed
diversion sites and strip topographic maps of 1:4,000 scale with 25 cm contour
intervals of the proposed main and secondary canals. Construction quantities
were estimated from the preliminary profiles of main and secondary canals.
Structures along these canals were sized according to the field surveys and
preliminary investigation. Cost of on-farm facilities (main farm ditch) and
drainage were based on unit quantity estimates per hectare of each majc-r item
obtained from sample areas applicable to a particular system for which designs
were prepared. The planning and design of the ten selected systems has been
carried out to a sufficient degree to permit the detail design of these
systems with limited additional work. Sufficient investigation have been
made to ensure that suitable materials are available for construction of
canal embankments and maintenance roadways.
3.05      The topographic maps of 1:4,000 scale used in the sample area
studies of the selected systems were prepared by the conventional ground
survey methods. The topographic maps of the service area on a scale of
1:4,000 would be prepared similarly and would be used for detail planning and
design of all works. Construction of the irrigation systems would begin in
early 1979 (see Figure 3.1) and all systems are expected to be completed by
mid-1982.
3.06      Preparation and Evaluation Procedures.  In order to ensure that
each system proposed for implementation under the project is technically
feasible and economically viable, the following procedure would be implemented
in the preparation and evaluation of the project systems:
(a)  preparation of scheme proposals by the regional offices including
topographic surveys and mapping, suitability of soils, water
availability and quality, preliminary layouts and estimates
of potential cropping intensity, present and potential yields, cost
estimates and economic analysis;
(b)  evaluation of scheme proposals by a multi-disciplinary team consis-
ting of senior staff from the PDD of NIA based on the following
criteria:
(i) at least 70% of farms would be less than 1.0 ha for systems
of 100 ha or less and 1.5 ha for larger systems;
(ii)  cropping intensity would be 130% or more;
(iii)  economic rate of return would be 10% or more;
(iv)  to insure an adequate institutional support for smaller
systems, the distance between two smaller systems would not
exceed 20 km;



- 20 -
(v) all farmers in the proposed system have been organized into
Irrigation Service Association (ISA) and properly registered
with the Securities and Exchange Commission of the Philippines;
and
(vi) the Farm Systems Development Corporation (FSDC) has entered
into a loan agreement with the ISA to repay NIA the cost of
constructing the system; and
(c) the evaluation team would produce an Evaluation Report which would
become the basis of detailed design to be carried out by the
regional offices.
3.07      An assurance was obtained that NIA would submit to the Associa-
tion for review prior to implementation an evaluation report for the systems
costing more than P 3.0 million and summary data forms for the remaining
systems. Agreement was reached on the content and format of evaluation
reports and summary data forms.  The preparation procedure outlined above
would be modified slightly for the two proposed impounding schemes in Bohol,
which would require considerable foundation and hydrologic investigations.
These schemes would be investigated and prepared by the specialized staff of
PDD. An assurance was obtained that the NIA would, under arrangements
satisfactory to the Association, cause the dams built under the Project for
the proposed impounding reservoirs, to be periodically inspected in accordance
with sound engineering practices in order to determine whether there are any
deficiencies in the condition of such structures, or in the quality and
adequacy of maintenance or methods of operations of the same, which may
endanger their safety. To this end, the NIA shall propose to the Association
appropriate arrangements for the Association's review no later than one year
before the expected completion of such structures.
3.08      Water Supply and Demand.  The most important aspect of design
for communal systems is the selection and evaluation of the water source,
usually in the absence of any flow records for the stream in question. The
most critical hydrologic information is the dependability of the water supply,
that is, the minimum flow of a specified duration which would occur with
specified probability. The normal practice in the Philippines is to use
the monthly flows with 80% probability of occurrence (four out of five years)
as design flow, which determines the area that can be irrigated from a
given source. In a few cases (mostly the larger rivers) direct observations
would be analyzed to estimate the design low flow. In other cases, records
from adjacent or nearby catchments would be correlated and extrapolated
to produce a simulated record for the stream in question. Calculations
based on this procedure would be supplemented wherever possible by field
observations, information from local inhabitants and consideration of the
existing water rights on each stream.
3.09      A preliminary investigation for each system was carried out accord-
ing to the procedure outlined above. For water demand, it was assumed that
transplanted rice using 120-day nonphoto-sensitive varieties in both wet and



- 21 -
dry season would be the dominant crop. Water requirements in the six pro-
vinces (Table 3.1) were based on the cropping calendar shown in Figure 5.1.
Annual diversion requirements are estimated to vary between provinces from a
depth of 1.9 m to 3.8 m of which 1.3 m to 2.6 m would be required in the dry
season. The size of the irrigated area for each system was determined from
preliminary simulated estimates of monthly stream flows and water requirements.
The cropping calendar was chosen to maximize the use of rainfall.  No use of
return flow was assumed. About 6,000 ha could be irrigated during the
dry season. Adequate water supply is available to meet the supplementary
irrigation demand of each system during the wet season. The currently irrigated
areas and the irrigable areas selected for development under the project are
summarized below and given in detail for each system in Annex 1:

Although the future irrigable areas for each system would be determined taking
into account the water rights of existing users, assurances were obtained
from the Government that the necessary water rights for each system would be
granted to the concerned ISA and no other rights which could adversely affect
the project water supply would be granted except by mutual agreement with the
Association.
Barangay Roads
3.10      Project Works.  This component of the project would consist of 155
stretches of roads for a total length of about 1,400 km in the six provinces
of the project. The road stretches would range in length from 3-17 km as
shown in Annex 1. However, since the process of selection and evaluation is
still continuing, the final list of roads may vary slightly from those listed
at present. The improvement of existing roads and the construction of new
roads would provide a single lane, all weather gravel-surface for medium-sized
trucks and four-wheel drive utility vehicles. The design speeds, geometric
standards and surface requirements would meet minimum all-weather traffic
requirements as dictated by the low traffic volumes on barangay roads.

3.11      Existing roads on reasonably satisfactory alignments would be
improved by restoring the formation to the specified width, compaction of
the subgrade to a suitable California Bearing Ratio (CBR) level and provi-
sion of a gravel running surface. Due to the intense storms and frequent
typhoons in the Philippines, particular attention would be given to drainage
and cross drainage structures. Reinforced concrete bridges would be pro-
vided on major rivers or stream crossings. The base course level of road
embankments passing through rice areas would be about 50 cm above the ground
surface and above the expected normal flood water level. Existing roads with
unsatisfactory sub-soil conditions, steep gradients and sharp curvatures
would be replaced with new suitable alignments. Surveys and detail design
would be carried out according to the accepted DPH practice for minor roads
and the guidelines shown in Table 3.2. The top of the gravel finished surface
would be a minimum of 60 cm above normal ground level in rice cultivated areas
and be of screened or crushed material with a minimum thickness of 20 cm.
Single lane 4.0 m-wide bridges and culverts would be permanent concrete
structures. Piles used for the foundation of these structures would have a
minimum bearing capacity of 50 tons. The drainage structures would have a
free board of 1.0 m above the maximum estimated water level (flood of 10-year
frequency). Drainage ditches along both side of the road would be designed to
carry flows of 5-year frequency.

3.12      Status of Engineering.  Preliminary project planning studies,
designs and estimates were carried out by the Project Planning and Development
Service (PPDS) of DPH with assistance from field offices and the BBR central
office. The preliminary alignment of each stretch of road identified in Annex
1 was first chosen from all available data including topographic maps, and
then checked in the field. A longitudinal profile for each stretch of the
proposed alignment was prepared by survey in the field. Detailed cross
sections at 50-100 m intervals and profiles were prepared for one project road
in each of three areas representative of the type of terrain to obtain earth-
work quantities for the estimates. In-depth investigations were made of the
foundation conditions at each bridge site by hand auger borings and similar
random soil samples were taken along the road alignment. Materials resource
surveys were made in each province to ascertain the availability of suitable
construction materal for computing unit costs. Bridge super structure designs
are based on standard type of reinforced concrete deck girder bridges exten-
sively used in the Philippines. Construction of the barangay roads would
begin in early 1979 (Figure 3.1). All project roads are expected to be
completed by end-1982.
3.13      Preparation and Evaluation Procedure.  In order to ensure that each
road stretch proposed for implementation under the project is technically
feasible and economically viable, a special team from the PPDS of DPH would be
responsible for final evaluation of the project roads based on the following
criteria:
(a) the proposed road would provide access to roads of equal or
better standard and would not be less than 3 km in length,
with an area of influence not overlapping those of
existing or planned roads;
(b) proposals would conform with provincial road development
priorities;
(c) each stretch of road would serve a minimum of two villages
and/or a population of about 100/km of proposed road stretch;
(d) the economic rate of return would be 10% or more.
The PPDS would produce an evaluation report which would become the basis of
detailed design. An assurance was obtained that DPH would submit evaluation
reports for review by the Association prior to implementation for the road
stretches costing more than P 4.0 million and summary of data forms for
the remaining road stretches costing less than P 4.0 million. Agreement
was reached on the content and format of evaluation reports and summary
data forms.

Ports
3.14      Project Works.  Three ports located in three project provinces
would be rehabilitated and improved under the project. Two ports, San Jose
de Buena Vista in Antique province and Culasi in Capiz are national ports
operated and maintained by the Philippines Port Authority (PPA). The
third municipal port in Aklan province is operated and maintained by its
municipality.
3.15      San Jose de Buena Vista port is the main port of Antique province
serving its capital town. The port facilities consist of a 76 m long
reinforced concrete wharf connected to a 200 m long rock causeway. It has a
controlling water depth of 4.0 m below Mean Low Water Level (MLWL) alongside
the wharf to accommodate ferries, motor launches and fishing boats. The
larger (60 m or more) interisland ships cannot use the port. A rock breakwater
extends 87 m southeast toward a coral formation, but it is too short to
protect the port during the southwest monsoon. The port has an unsurfaced
storage area of about 2,500 sq m. Electricity, although unreliable, is
supplied from the town. To protect the port from the southwest monsoon winds
and provide an all-weather sheltered basin area, the rock breakwater would be
realigned and extended by about 200 m to the offshore reef. A timber section
of the existing wharf would be replaced with reinforced concrete. An area of
about 4,000 sq m behind the wharf would be reclaimed, and surfaced and 500 sq
m would be covered by a shed. An independent water supply would be provided.
Electricity would be extended to the wharf apron and the storage areas would
be fenced.
3.16      Culasi port, situated 8 km northeast of Roxas city, is the main
port of Capiz province. The port facilities consist of a 56 m long and 12 m
wide reinforced concrete wharf connected at right angles to a 155 m long
reinforced concrete pier. The controlling depth along the wharf is 5.0 m
below MLWL and along the pier it varies between 3.0 m and 5.0 m. Storage
area is limited to an open partly surfaced area of 3,800 sq m and a cargo
shed of about 280 sq m. The port has no water supply and is presently without
electricity. The poor alignment of the southern breakwater hampers the
movement of vessels and leads to rapid accumulation of littoral materials
from the bay within the berthing area requiring frequent dredging. The
breakwater would be realigned to minimize silting and widen the port entrance.
To accommodate the increasing fishing boat traffic, a new fishing boat pier
(100 m long) would be constructed. An area of about 3,000 sq m would be
reclaimed and the open storage areas would be asphalted and fenced. Provisions
would be made for the supply of water and electricity.
3.17      Dumaguit municipal port is located about 2 km  from the mouth
of the New Washington river and 21 km from Kalibo town, the capital of Aklan
province. It is located 8 km downstream of the inland and more frequently
used port of New Washington. The river channel leading to New Washington is
shallow, subject to heavy silting, and requiring frequent dredging. The port
also has limited berthing space and insufficient cargo storage area. The
water depth at Dumaguit ranges from 4 m to 12 m compared to 3.5 m at New
Washington. The improvement of Dumaguit port would permit the handling of
larger vessels and increased traffic. At present Dumaguit port handles



- 26 -
little traffic, and except Eor an uncompleted, reinforced concrete pier
structure, has no facilities. Based on an inter-island vessel length of
about 60 m, a 75 m decking installation would be constructed which would
utilize the existing uncompLeted pier. Behind the quay an area of about
2,400 sq m area would be reclaimed and 300 sq m passenger/cargo shed would be
built. The port would also be provided with water supply facilities.
3.18      Status of Engineering.  Project planning and cost estimates of
each port were prepared by the Harbors and Ports Division of the Bureau of
Public Works (BPW) of the Department of Public Works, Transportation and
Communications (DPWTC) with the assistance of Philippines Port Authority
(PPA). The works included in the project for each port are based on actual
needs determined by field inspection and discussion with the field operating
staff of each port. The improvement of the ports would begin in early 1979
(Figure 3.1). All project works are expected to be completed by mid-1981.
Barangay Health Stations
3.19      Project Works.  Sixty Barangay Health Stations listed in Annex 1
would be built in the six project provinces. These stations would be located
in barrios (villages) approximately 5 to 10 km from a Rural Health Unit
(para. 2.14). Each health station would be built on a publicly owned 300 sq m
plot of land with a floor area of about 50 sq m. The facilities would
include a waiting porch, receiving area, minor treatment room, prenatal
examination room, infant's examination room, toilet facilities, kitchenette,
storage room and utility room. A water supply system of shallow well, pump
and small storage tank would be constructed for each station. Some of the
proposed barangay health stations in the provinces of Abra and Kalinga-Apayao
have no road access, and this would be provided under the barangay road
component.
3.20      Status of Engineering.  The cost estimates of the barangay health
stations were based on a typical design for such buildings in the Philippines.
The cost estimate took into account the remoteness of some of the proposed
stations. Construction would begin in early 1979 (see Figure 3.1), and
would be completed by mid-1981.
Rural Water Supply
3.21      Project Works.  The proposed wells would be drilled with drilling
depths varying from 6 m to about 100 m depending on the aquifer character-
istics, and the wells equipped with standard hand pumps. Easy access to the
wells would be ensured, a concrete basin facility for washing clothes pro-
vided for at each site, and the site fenced. A planning component of the
project would stress improving drilling methods and reducing costs.
3.22      Selection, Design and Construction Criteria.  In order to reduce
costs and minimize maintenance, while at the same time meeting public health
standards, the following criteria would be followed:
(a) records and logs oiE existing wells near each site would be
evaluated prior to construction in order to indicate possible
aquifer conditions;



- 27 -
(b)  wells would be located at least 300 m apart;
(c)  wells would be situated at least 30 m from any source of con-
tamination;
(d)  pump-bases at least 50 cm above the highest flood level; and
(e)  aquifers properly screened.
Existing design standards would be revised and submitted for the Association's
review by December 31, 1978, taking into account the following:
(a)  drilling depths would be related to aquifer depths;
(b)  driven wells are less costly than drilled wells where shallow
aquifers are encountered; and
(c)  PVC casi-ngs should be used as well as steel casings, and
consideration should be given to PVC and stainless steel
screens in place of standard slotted screens.
The villagers would provide, free of charge, the land for the well and the
access road, as well as provide the labor to construct the road and fencing.
The villagers would subsequently maintain the facilities in a satisfactory
condition.
Preparation of Future Infrastructure Components
3.23      The project would provide for the preparation of a future rural
infrastructure project for ten provinces to be selected by the Government.
Provinces and project components would be selected by the National Economic
Development Authority (NEDA) on the basis of regional development plans,
provincial needs and the implementing capacity of the various line agencies.
NEDA and DPWTC would be responsible for overall supervision and coordination
of project preparation. The project would provide for surveys, mapping and
investigations of the various components and wherever necessary for contrac-
tual services for investigations and consultants. Assurances were obtained
from the Government that engagement of consultant services to assist in
project preparation would be under terms and conditions acceptable to the
Association. The preparation would begin in mid-1978 and is expected to be
completed by mid-1980.
Cost Estimates
3.24      Total project costs are estimated at US$59 million, of which
US$28 million or 48% is foreign exchange. Project costs are based on quan-
tity estimates for feasibility designs and unit prices prevailing in Bank-
assisted projects in mid-1976 adjusted to conditions in the six project
provinces. Unit prices for equipment, materials and supplies are based on
recent quotations received by the agencies responsible for the various
project components. The Government exempts its various departments and



- 28 -
agencies from paying taxes or duties for equipment, material and services
procured under foreign-assisted projects, so all the costs exclude such
taxes. Line agencies costs for design and construction supervision as
well as the central project office operation costs are included under
engineering. All costs are indexed to a common level, June 1978 and this
is the base cost level for the project. A physical contingency factor
based on the degree of investigations completed to date was applied. For
such components, as communal irrigation systems and barangay roads, where
actual cost estimates were prepared for about 10-25% of the total systems
and road segments of the Project, a factor of 20% was used. For other
components a factor of 10% was used. Costs due to expected price increases
over the implementation period amount to about 19% of total base cost plus
physical contingencies, assuming the following annual inflation rates.

Financing
3.26      The proposed IDA credit of US$28 million would finance the full
foreign exchange cost of the project. It would cover 48% of the total
project costs. The Government would provide the remaining P 229.4 million
(US$31 million) to the various line agencies from annual budget appropriations.
Each implementing agency would maintain a separate account for the project
and would submit budget requests to the Project Director (para. 4.02) for
approval.  The Project Director would forward approved requests to the
Commissioner of the Budget, who would disburse all project funds directly
to the implementing agencies in accordance with normal Government procedures,
which are satisfactory to ensure the continuous and timely flow of project
funds.
Procurement
3.27      Equipment, vehicles, spare parts and supplies for communal
irrigation systems, O&M of barangay roads, force account constructiorn of
rural water supply and materials and supplies for barangay health stations
costing about US$5.2 million, would be procured after international competi-
tive bidding in accordance with Bank Group Guidelines. A preference limited
to 15% of the c.i.f. price of imported goods, or the customs duty, whichever
is lower would be extended to local manufacturers in the evaluation of bids.
Local procurement practices are appropriate for off-the-shelf items costing
less than US$10,000 each because the advantages of international competitive
bidding would be clearly outweighed by the administrative costs involved.
The total cost of such items for all components of the project would not
exceed US$300,000. Association staff have reviewed the local procedures
and they are acceptable. There is adequate competition and foreign firms
can participate. A list of equipment requirements is given in Annex 1.
NIA would handle the procurement of vehicles and equipment required for
communal irrigation systems, future Project studies and the Central Project
Office. O&M equipment required for the barangay roads would be procured by
DPH. BPW would procure the drilling equipment and materials required for
the construction of rural water supply wells. Supplies and materials
required for barangay health stations would be procured by the special
project office of DOH.
3.28      Civil works on the project service area (US$38 million) would
be scattered over about 500 separate locations in six different provinces.
They would include about 9,400 ha of communal irrigation systems (55 loca-
tions), 1,400 km of barangay roads (155 stretches), 3 ports, 60 rural health
stations and 300 wells for rural water supply. These works have to be
executed by six different agencies and would therefore not be suitable for
international competitive bidding. Most of the larger communal irrigation
systems, barangay roads, ports, and health centers would be done by contract.
The remaining works such as small communal irrigation systems (less than 100
ha), barangay roads (less than 5 km) and water supply wells, which would
amount to about 30% of total project works, would be carried out by force
account. An assurance was obtained that the implementing line agencies
would ensure that the aggregate amount of civil works done by force account



- 33 -
would not exceed 40% of the total cost of the work. Competitive bidding in
accordance with local procedures is appropriate for the works to be carried
out by contract. Association staff has reviewed the local procedures and
they are acceptable. There is potentially adequate competition and foreign
firms can participate.
Disbursements
3.29      Disbursements would be made at the rate of 100% of the foreign
exchange cost of directly imported equipment, and 100% of the ex-factory
price of locally manufactured equipment and 65% for imported equipment
procured locally. Disbursement for civil works would be 40% of certified
monthly progress payments or expenditure. Disbursements for force account
work would be made against certificates of expenditure, the documentation
for which would not be submitted to the Association for review, but would
be retained by the borrower and made available for inspection by the
Association's supervision missions. For civil works contractor's mobilization
and equipment, disbursement would be at 100% of foreign exchange cost. For
costs of consultants and technical assistance, disbursement would be at the
rate of 100% of total cost.
3.30      Disbursements of the IDA credit would be against import documenta-
tion, contracts and certified records of payments or expenditure. It is
expected that disbursements would be completed by December 31, 1983,
approximately one year after the end of construction. In consultation with
the Association, savings under the project would be used to finance similar
additional works in the project area. An estimated schedule of expenditure,
a semiannual disbursement schedule and a proposed allocation of credit
proceeds are given in Annex 1.
Accounts and Audit
3.31      The NIA, DPH, DOH and BPW are Government agencies and their
accounts are audited annually by the Government's Commission on Audit.
Assurances were obtained that these agencies would maintain separate
accounts for the project and that after audit by the Commission on Audit,
the project accounts, together with the auditor's comments and opinion on
the certification of expenditure for force account work, would be sent to
the Association within six months of the close of each financial year.
Environmental Effects
3.32      In all six provinces of the project, malaria is effectively con-
trolled by a Government program of house spraying with residual insecticides.
Schistosomiasis is only found in a very small area in the northeastern corner
of Bohol Island well removed from the proposed irrigation systems. The
principal health problems in the six provinces are protein deficiencies
in small children, tuberculosis and enteric diseases. The proposed project
would have little impact on these. The project would have a beneficial
effect in the remote areas of the provinces through the provision of roads,
health stations and potable water supply.

4. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
Central Project Organization
4.01      Implementation of the project would require coordination between a
number of national line departments and agencies. These are the National
Irrigation Administration (NIA), the Farm Systems Development Corporation
(FSDC), the Departments of Public Highways (DPH), Public Works, Transportation
and Communications (DPWTC), Public Health (DOH), Local Government and
Community Development (DLGCD) and the Philippines Ports Authority (PPA).
Responsibility for establishing overall policies related to the activities of
these organizations under the project would rest with the Cabinet Coordinating
Committee for Rural Development (CCC), within the National Economic and
Development Authority (NEI)A). The Secretary of DPWTC has been designated
as the Cabinet Coordinator. Coordination of day-to-day activities of the
project in Manila would rest with the Central Project Office (CPO) under the
direction of a Project Director. The CPO has been established following the
pattern adopted for the Mindoro Rural Development Project (Loan 1102-PH).
The Government has appointed a qualified and experienced person as Project
Director, after consultation with the Association. Assurances were obtained
that new appointment of a Project Director during the project implementation
period would be subject tco consultation with the Association.
4.02      The Project Director would be responsible for reviewing detailed
annual budgets and approving work programs for project activities prepared by
the participating departments and agencies. To perform this function, he
would be assisted by a Steering Committee chaired by one of the Assistant
Secretaries of DPWTC designated by the Cabinet Coordinator (Secretary of
DPWTC) and composed of senior officers from each of the departments and
agencies involved in the project and a representative of Budget Commission.
The committee members would be empowered to speak for their respective
organizations as far as the project is concerned. The Government has estab-
lished the Steering Committee. Each department and agency would prepare an
annual budget and work program for its part of the project and submit them
to the Steering Committee for approval at least three months in advance of
each fiscal year. The Project Director would forward a copy of the approved
annual budgets and work programs to the Association for information as an
aid to project supervision. Budgetary provisions have been made for the
project for 1978.
4.03      The CPO would have a small administrative, accounting and monitor-
ing staff divided into three divisions. In addition to a division dealing
with personnel and routine administrative matters, there would be a budget
division and monitoring division. The budget division would handle budget
requests, disbursements and consolidated accounts for the project. The
monitoring division would be responsible for monitoring the progress and
quality of project works, and compilation of progress reports. The
monitoring division would compile a completion report based on the periodic
progress reports, actual expenditure for each component and preliminary
evaluation of sample benefits monitored during the project execution by each



- 35 -
implementing agency. As part of the reporting requirements of the project
there would be continuous monitoring of the agricultural development associated
with selected roads and communal irrigation systems in each of the project
provinces. An assurance was obtained that the Government would submit the
completion report for Association review within six months of the Closing
Date of the Credit. The Project Director would maintain the contacts
with individual components of the project through Project Managers or Project
Officers appointed by the implementing line agencies.
Project Implementation Organizations
4.04      Communal Irrigation Systems.  NIA would be responsible for selection,
evaluation and construction of the systems and preparation of the irrigation
component of future rural infrastructure project in close coordination with
FSDC. The Assistant Administrator for Engineering and Operations is
responsible to the Administrator for the regional NIA offices covering the
Philippines. At headquarters, there are a number of support departments
headed by Directors, which are represented at the regional level by divisions
with similar functions. The regional offices are headed by regional
directors who are responsible for all NIA activities in the provinces
constituting their regions through provincial engineers. NIA has appointed
a Project Manager based in Manila (Figure 4.1) to be directly responsible
for execution of the irrigation component under the overall supervision of
the Assistant Administrator for Engineering and Operations. The Project
Manager, with a small support staff, would have day-to-day responsibility
for coordinating the work at headquarters of the three NIA departments with
significant roles in project implementation. Execution at the field level
would be under the immediate control of the Regional Directors of NIA's
Regions 1, 2, 6 and 7 and the provincial engineers of the six provinces.
The evaluation for final selection of the systems to be included in the
present project and preparation for future rural infrastructure project
would be carried out by the Project Development Department (PDD) of NIA.
The engineering and operations division of each region would prepare
detailed designs and administer the construction contracts. The provincial
engineers would supervise the construction and assist in initial identifi-
cation of proposed systems and coordinate with FSDC the organization of
farmers into irrigation systems associations.  The existing staff of NIA is
capable of handling the work program, although some strengthening of
provincial offices by transfer of personnel to the existing departments
would be needed.
4.05      FSDC was created (PD 681) in April 1975 to develop farmers' organiza-
tions for small pump or gravity irrigation projects owned and operated by
small farmers, which are known as communal irrigation projects. FSDC, under
an existing memorandum of agreement with NIA, organizes the farmers into
Irrigation Service Associations (ISAs). Construction work by NIA would be
undertaken only after an association has been organized by FSDC, formally
registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and has agreed to repay
NIA the cost of construction (para. 3.06). Separate associations would be
organized for systems larger than 100 ha and smaller systems would have one
association for two or three systems. About 45 such associations would be
organized under the project. The regional offices of FSDC would handle the
recruitment and training of the institutional officers assigned to each



- 36 -
ISA. The institutional officer assigned to each association would be respon-
sible for supervising the operation and maintenance of the system, training
of the association members and assisting the association to make contact with
the various agencies providing agricultural supporting services to farmers.
The provincial offices of FSDC would monitor the operation, maintenance and
agricultural production of the systems for a minimum period of five years
after completion of construction. About 15 institutional officers with a
minimum of two years college education preferably in agriculture would be
recruited and trained before September 30, 1978, another 20 by June 30, 1979
and the remaining 10 by June 30, 1980. Assurances were obtained that FSDC
would recruit and train 45 additional institutional officers according to an
agreed schedule indicated above and complete this before June 30, 1980.
4.06      The ISAs operate as cooperatives with elected officers as President,
Vice President, Secretary-Treasurer, Auditor and five man Board of Directors.
The association serves as a pivotal center of information, skills development,
training and provision of various agricultural inputs and services needed by
its members. Each ISA under a set of articles of incorporation and by-laws
has a legal status which enables it to enter into agreements and assess as
well as collect from its members the levies imposed for any capital investment
and charges for annual operation and maintenance. The principal agencies
providing the agricultural supporting services in each province are the
Bureau of Agricultural Extension (BAE), Bureau of Plant Industries (BPI),
Agricultural Credit Administration (ACA), Department of Local Government and
Community Development (DLGCD), National Grains Authority (NGA), Philippines
National Bank (PNB) and the Rural Banks (RBs). FSDC would coordinate the
assistance and cooperation of all these agencies in the project systems
through their provincial, regional and institutional officers. An assurance
was obtained that the Government would include the communal irrigation
component of the project within the scope of the plan of action for provision
of agricultural supporting services to Bank Group-assisted irrigation projects
being prepared under the National Irrigation Systems Improvement Project II
(Loan 1526 PH).
4.07      Barangay Roads.  The Bureau of Barangay Roads (BBR) established in
1975 within DPH would implement this component of the project. BBR is headed
by a Director who reports to the DPH Assistant Secretary for Operations. At
headquarters, BBR has four support divisions and three sections under each
division with a total staff of about 200 technical and administrative personnel
(Figure 4.2). DPH has appointed the Assistant Director of BBR as the Project
Mianager based in Manila to be directly responsible for execution of the
project's road component under the overall supervision of the Director of
BBR. A project office would be established at headquarters under the Project
Manager to coordinate the work of the various divisions of BBR and of the
consultants to be appointed under the project (para. 4.11). Final approval of
roads selected for implementation under the project would rest with the
Project Planning and Development Service (PPDS) of DPH (para. 3.13). DPH
would strengthen PPDS staff at headquarters to handle the additional work of
evaluating road stretches included in the project.



- 37 -
4.08      DPH's field activities are administered through regional offices
headed by Regional Directors. A Barangay Roads Division at each of the
regional offices represents BBR at the regional level and is in charge of all
regional activities related to barangay roads. Each Barangay Roads Division
consists of three sections with about nine engineers; these sections would be
strengthened by the addition of five engineers and six technicians under the
project. The divisions would administer contracts and supervise all project-
related construction activities under the immediate control of Regional
Directors.
4.09      Each region in turn has district offices which are administered by
highway district engineers. The Barangay Roads Section of each district
carries out the construction, improvement and maintenance of barangay roads,
and is composed of two units with two engineers and one surveyor. The six
project provinces have eight districts, with one district in each province
except Bohol and Kalinga-Apayao provinces, each of which has two districts.
A new Barangay Roads section headed by a Project Engineer would be established
in each of the eight districts. These sections, which would report directly
to the regional director, would assume responsibility for the project's field
activities. Each section, with the coordination of the regional barangay
roads divisions, would prepare detail designs, supervise the construction,
and monitor the traffic count and road usage, as well as increased production
due to these roads, which would be useful in future projects of similar
scope. These sections would consist of a planning and design unit, adminis-
trative unit and construction unit. The units would require about 10 engineers
and 30 technicians (Figure 4.2). Thus the total field staff required at the
regional level would be about 40 and at the district level reporting directly
to the regional director about 300 composed of engineers and technicians.
Most of the senior technical positions (about 40) would be filled by transfer
from headquarters. DPH intends to use the project roads for training the new
graduate engineers entering its service, so most of the junior engineering
positions requiring less experience would be filled by these engineers.
Positions of technicians (about 200) requiring a minimum of two years of
college education or technical high school graduates would be filled either
by transfer of existing staff from headquarters and regions or new recruitment.
Assurances were obtained from the Government that DPH would appoint experienced
engineers of district engineer level to the posts of Project Engineers and
assign the additional personnel required for project evaluation and implemen-
tation at headquarters, regional and district offices according to an agreed
schedule by December 31, 1979.
4.10      Certain aspects of the barangay road construction which would
comprise of low-standard, low-traffic gravel roads of short lengths in
geographically dispersed locations, are well suited for labor-based cons-
truction and maintenance methods. However, the efficient application of such
methods require careful planning and management. The local contractors
executing such works are known to use a mix of labor and equipment. Consi-
dering the scope of the Government's future plans for rural roads, it is
important that institutional capacity is developed within DPH to carry out a



- 38 -
major part of such program with labor-based methods. In view of this, DPH
would prepare a plan to strengthen its capability to undertake construction
-sing labor-intensive methods, staff training, contracting procedures and
assistance to the contractors for efficient use of labor. The plan would
identify and consider implementing about 50 km of project roads as a pilot
project according to the recommendations. The pilot roads would be imple-
mented during the last two years of the project implementation period. DPH
would be assisted by a qualified engineer in the preparation of this plan,
for which a provision of four man-months has been made under the technical
assistance part of the road component. An assurance was obtained that
DPH would prepare a plan of action for labor-based construction methods by
June 30, 1979 with the assistance of a qualified engineer employed on terms
and conditions acceptable to the Association. After review of the plan by
the Association, DPH would proceed with the implementation by December 31,
1979.
4.11      An engineer experienced in rural roads planning, design, construc-
tion and maintenance would be employed for a period of two years to assist the
Director of BBR at headquarters and the regional and district offices in
project implementation. To augment the design staff of BBR at headquarters
and in the regions, consultants would be employed by DPH to assist in the
project preparation of detailed design and contract documents. It is esti-
mated that such services would not exceed 200 man-months. Due to the
simple nature of design work and existence of local consulting firms in the
Philippines, it is expected that local consultants would be engaged at an
estimated overall cost of $2,500 per man-month. An assurance was obtained
that DPH would employ the rural roads engineer and consultants on terms and
conditions acceptable to the Association.
4.12      BBR, through the regional and district offices, has the responsibil-
ity of maintaining barangay roads. Since its establishment in 1975, BBR has
overcome most of the initial difficulties of organization, staffing and
financing. BBR is presently executing a small roads program under a Bank
Group-assisted land settlement project (Loan 1421-PH), as well as a number of
other locally financed ruraLl roads rehabilitation projects. At the comple-
tion of construction, the mlaintenance responsibility for these roads would
revert to each district engineer's office. The additional length of about
140-250 km of rural roads to each district maintenance program would not
adversely affect their overall maintenance capability.
4.13      Unlike national roads, which are subject to high traffic densities
and consist of asphalt and concrete pavements requiring more advanced mechani-
cal and technical maintenance techniques, the maintenance of low standard
gravel roads is more labor intensive. Each of the existing barangay roads
section at the district level has a maintenance unit headed by an engineer.
Under the project each maintenance unit would be strengthened by the addition
of an engineer and two technicians. The annual maintenance fund provided for



- 39 -
barangay roads at present amounts to about P 2,500 per km, which is inade-
quate for the task. Assurances were be obtained from the GovArnment that
within five years of completion of construction of project roads the annual
maintenance funds for all barangay roads within the six project provinces
would be raised gradually to the equivalent of P 6,000 per km. It was
informally agreed that this figure would be in terms of constant mid-1978
prices. This would allow for annual maintenance at the rate of P 4,000 per
km (Annex 1) and periodic maintenance of P 10,000 per km at five-year
intervals.
4.14      A set of barangay road maintenance equipment would be provided
under the project for each district for hauling of gravel and periodic
regrading of road surfaces. This would consist of a motor grader with
scarifier, an industrial tractor with a backhoe/loader attachment, a farm
tractor, a rubber-tyred self-propelled roller, a self-propelled grid roller,
a dump truck, a water tank truck and a flatbed truck. This equipment would
be used not only for the project roads, but also would maintain the other
barangay roads i' the district. This equipment would be under the direct
control of the Barangay Road Sections of the district offices. Light repairs
of the equipment would be done at the existing area shops at the district
level or the somewhat larger base shops at the regional level. Major repairs
would be carried out at DPH mechanical workshops, which were established in
Northern Luzon under the Bank assisted Third Highway Project (Loan 1353-PH).
DPII expects to establish such workshops on Panay island in subsequent highway
projects. Assurances were obtained from the Government that DPH would
ensure that the equipment supplied under the Project would remain under the
operational control of district engineers and would be for the exclusive use
of barangay road maintenance in these districts.
4.15      Ports, Barangay Health Stations and Rural Water Supply.  The Bureau of
Public Works (BPW) of DPWTC would be responsible for the design and construc-
tion of ports, the construction supervision of barangay health stations and the
drilling of wells and would establish a small office headed by a Project
Coordinator to organize the activities of the three divisions of BPW connected
with the project. The Ports and Harbors Division would be responsible for
ports. The Buildings Division for the barangay health stations and the Water
Resources Division for rural water supplies. The coordinating office would
also be responsible for budgets, procurement, contract administration and
monitoring of work progress for the ports and rural water supply. As the
ports design work and contract documents preparation would be carried out by
the Ports and Harbor Division of BPW, its staff would be strengthened by
internal transfers and new appointments. The Building Division of BPW is
currently engaged in the construction supervision of rural health units being
built under the Bank-assisted Population Project (Loan 1035-PH). It would
continue to provide similar construction supervision for the proposed barangay
health stations under the project without any increase in staff. The Wells
and Springs Unit in BPII's Water Resources Division would be responsible for
the water supply component. The Unit would be strengthened by the appointment
of a hydrogeologist with well-drilling experience as a Project Manager, a



- 40 -
training officer and an administrative assistant. Execution at the field
level would be under the immediate control of BPW's Regional Directors in
Regions 1, 2, 6 and 7 and District Engineers of the six provinces.
4.16      Ports.  The Ports and Harbor Division of BPW is represented at
the regional level by a section and by a unit at the provincial level. The
sections in Regions 6 and units in the provinces of Antique, Aklan and
Capiz would be responsible for construction. BPW would strengthen these
offices and would establish a field office at each of the three ports
with a staff of about 3 engineers and 4 construction inspectors for the
duration of the construction period. BPW expects to complete the staffing
arrangements before December 31, 1978.
4.17      The Philippines Port Authority (PPA) was created in 1975 to ensure
the efficient operations, management and development of major Philippines
ports. PPA is also empowered to administer, operate, control and supervise
ports including private piers and marine facilities. Since its establishment,
PPA has taken over 47 ports including the two project por,s of San Jose de
Buena Vista and Culasi. PPA would be involved in the planning, review
of plans before tendering and scheduling of construction program. PPA would
continue to operate the two national ports presently under its control.
The third municipal port was taken over by PPA in January 1978. Assurances
were obtained that: (a) the Government would guarantee adequate funds
annually to PPA for maintaining these ports; and (b) the Government would
cause PPA to prepare a plan of action by June 30, 1979 outlining the procedures
and fees to be levied for the use of the port facilities, which would adequately
cover the costs of operating and maintaining each port as well as recovering
part of the cost of the improvements, after review of the plan by the Associa-
tion, the Government would proceed with the implementation by December 31, 1979.
4.18      Barangay Health Stations.  The Project Management Staff (PMS) of DOH
established for the Bank-assisted population project (Loan 1035-PH) would be
responsible for contract administration, construction, procurement of
supplies and materials, training and hiring of rural health midwives and the
operation of the 60 barangay stations to be built under the project. PMS works
at the field level through service groups established in the 12 regional
health offices.  The regional offices in Regions 1, 2, 6 and 7 would be
responsible for the construction of the barangay health stations. The district
offices of BPW in the six provinces would supervise the construction of
the stations. Under an existing memorandum of agreement, the Department of
Local Government and Commun:ity Development (DLGCD) is currently providing
coordination and monitoring services and the maintenance of Rural Health Units



- 41 -
built under the Population Project (Loan 1035-PH). Similar arrangements
would be continued for the proposed project. The present staff of PMS, BPW
and DLGCD currently engaged on the population project is adequate to cover
the activities of the proposed project.
4.19      Rural Water Supply.  At the regional level, the water resources
section of BPW would be strengthened. New drilling teams consisting of a
senior well driller, three well drillers and three technical aids would be
assigned to work under the district engineer of BPW in each province.
After construction, these wells would be handed over to the Barangay councils
who would be responsible for their maintenance. The district office of BPW
would monitor the maintenance, sanitary upkeep and use of the wells by the
beneficiaries. Assurances were obtained that BPW would strengthen the
staff in the field offices in the project area as well as at headquarters and
complete the recruitment and training of its personnel for the water supply
component by June 30, 1979.
5. AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION, MARKET PROSPECTS AND PRICES,
FARM INCOME, AND PROJECT CHARGES
(Communal Irrigation Systems)
Agricultural Production
5.01      Present Cropping Pattern.  In most of the project systems the
wet-season rainfed rice crop starts in May/June and harvesting takes place in
December/January. Cultivation is by animal drawn implements as almost no
hand tractors are available. Practically all rice is transplanted from field
nurseries onto previously puddled land. Farmers use little fertilizer (about
50 kg/ha) and HYV seeds, and practically no insecticides or herbicides.
Crops are usually hand-weeded twice during a season and are manually har-
vested and threshed. Grain is sun-dried on mats, roads, drying floors or
other suitable surfaces, and stored in the house for home consumption, seed,
or sale. Average wet-season rainfed paddy yield is around 1.5 ton/ha.
5.02      Future Cropping Patterns.  In the absence of the project, there
would be no significant change in cropping patterns. However, with the
project, farmers would grow only irrigated rice in the proposed communal
systems. Cropping intensity for the individual systems would depend on the
available water supplies. However, no system with a potential future cropping
intensity of less than 130% would be accepted in the project and the average
cropping intensity of the systems is expected to be 160% in the future.
Yields would vary depending on the degree of water control, the availability
of extension services, credit and input supplies. As project works would be
less intensive on small areas (100 ha or less) than on larger ones, and as
the smaller areas are more likely to be remote, water control and the level
of agricultural supporting services would be poorer on these areas than on
the larger ones.
5.03      Yields and Production.  In the absence of the project, the rate of
increase in rice yields is estimated at about 0.5% per annum mainly due to
some marginal improvements in application of inputs. With the project,



- 42 -
improved water control and more adequate supplies of credit and inputs
would raise rice yields. For systems smaller than 100 ha, the projected full
development yield is assumed to be 2.5 ton/ha, a modest increase of 1.0 ton/ha
over the present. For systems greater than 100 ha, the projected yield is 3.0
ton/ ha, an increase of 1.5 ton/ha over the existing level. As a result of
the project, rice production would increase from about 14,600 tons of paddy at
present to an estimated 44,200 tons at full development (Table 5.1).
Market Prospects and Prices
5.04      Rice.  A major objective of the Government in the agricultural
sector is self-sufficiency in basic foods, especially rice and corn. A
deficit in rice, the main staple crop, has been a persistent problem for the
Philippines. Between 1963 and 1967 the Philippines imported an average of
300,000 tons of rice annually. After a short period free of imports, the
Government started importing again in 1971 at an annual rate of over 300,000
tons, with a peak of 456,000 tons in 1972 as a result of disastrous floods.
Three consecutive good crops in 1974 to 1976 have allowed imports to be
reduced to 55,000 tons in 1976. In 1977, the Government exported 35,000 tons
and built a supply of about 3 months.   With the continued growth of popula-
tion and incomes, the demand for rice is expected to rise by about 3% annually.
Abra is a deficit province, while the other five provinces are surplus
provinces. Incremental rice production from Abra would be sold for consump-
tion in Bangued, while production from Kalinga-Apayao, Aklan, Antique, Capiz
and Bohol would be sold in Manila and the Central Visayas.
5.05      Prices.  Since 1957 the Government has set an annual farm-gate
support price for paddy to encourage production and allow some purchases of
paddy by Government to build stabilization stocks. Responsibility for
operating the system through purchases in the market rested with a statutory
body, the National Grains Authority (NGA). Through 1972, the farm-gate
support price for paddy and the domestic consumer price for rice kept pace
with changes in the world market price for rice. Between 1972 and 1975,
to keep domestic prices down in the face of record high world market prices
for rice, the Government subsidized consumers by maintaining a low official
ceiling price for rice and a correspondingly low farm-gate price for paddy by
sales of imported rice on the domestic market below cost. Since 1975,
the official support price and the world market prices have been practically
the same.
5.06      The Bank Group projects the world market price of Thai 25-35%
broken rice to rise (in constant mid-1978 prices) from US$230/ton f.o.b.
Bangkok in 1978 to US$290/ton in 1985. These projections have been used to
estimate the present and future farm-gate prices of paddy for the economic
analysis and farm budgets. Although such an exercise was done for each
project province, an average! price structure was used for the economic and
financial analysis (Table 5.2). The highest economic farm-gate price
calculated was in Abra (5% above the average) and the lowest in Kalinga-Apayao
(6% below the average). In the farm budgets, the actual price paid to
farmers was used in evaluating present income, and for the future it was
assumed that the financial farm-gate price for paddy would equal the financial

cost to the Government of importing equivalent amounts of rice. Table 5.2
also shows all the present and future fertilizer prices used for the farm
budgets and the economic analysis.
Farm Incomes
5.07      Two sizes of farms, 1.0 ha and 3.0 ha, were used for preparing farm
budgets. The 1.0 ha farm would represent an average farm in Abra, Antique,
Aklan and Bohol. Similarly, a 3.0 ha farm would represent an average farm in
Kalinga-Apayao and Capiz. The farm budgets for different types of farm owner-
ship are presented in Annex 2 and summarized in Table 5.3. Owner operators on
systems greater than 100 ha (88% of the project area) with 1.0 ha farms would
have a family income of US$770 at full development, equivalent to a per capita
income of US$140, while those with 3.0 ha farms would have a family income of
US$2,035 and a per capita income of US$370. Leaseholder family income would
be on an average US$200 per ha lower. Similarly, farm families on systems of
less than 100 ha would have on an average incomes lower by US$75 per ha. All
of the project's farm families are presently below the Association's estimated
per capita absolute poverty level of US$193 (1978 constant prices). At full
project development in 1987, the projected per capita incomes would range
from a low of US$95 for a 1.0 ha leaseholder farm to a maximum of $370 for a
3.0 ha owner-operated farm. Per capita income would be some 13-50% of the
1987 projected per capita GNP of US$745. The comparison indicates that the
project would help to narrow the income gap between the project area and
other parts of the country, and between rural and urban areas.
Cost and Rent Recovery - Irrigation Component
5.08      The NIA would construct the irrigation works and charge the cost to
the Irrigation Service Association (ISA) of each system. NIA's present
(December 31, 1977) terms of repayment for communal systems treat 10% of the
capital cost as a grant, 70% as an interest free loan and 20% as a loan with
an annual interest of 6%. The loan is repayable in 25 years, including a
4-1/2 year grace period. The average estimated cost of construction for
systems smaller than 100 ha is US$1,427/ha and for systems greater than
100 ha is US$1,197/ha.
5.09      In systems less than 100 ha, the rent recovery index is 48% for a
1.0 ha farm and 44% for a 3.0 ha farm. This index is 43% and 39% respec-
tively in systems greater than 100 ha (Table 5.4). The rent recovery index
does not appreciably change with size of farm but is lower in the bigger
system since cost per ha is lower and the incremental benefits are bigger.
The rent recovery index for the total project is 41%. This rent recovery
index is higher than in other Bank Group-assisted irrigation projects in the
Philippines though the overall cost recovery index of 25% is comparable to
the other Bank Group irrigation projects. The higher rent recovery index is
due to the modest increases in yields expected due to the project. In view
of the low income levels of the project beneficiaries, the proposed level
of repayment is acceptable. Contributions which farmers would make to
Government revenues in the form of land tax have been taken into account in
these calculations.  No "betterment" taxes or other government levies are
envisaged for the project area.

5.10      The proposed level of project charges is consistent with the
objective of preventing a widening gap between rural and urban incomes. To
ensure an equitable contribution by beneficiaries toward recovery of project
cost, an assurance was obtained that the beneficiaries of the communal
irrigation systems would continue to contribute to the capital cost of the
facilities at the existing levels, which are described above (para. 5.08).
It was also agreed that NIA would consult annually with the Association on
the adequacy of such levels.
6. BENEFITS, JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS
Irrigation Systems
6.01      The proposed communal irrigation systems would increase yields on
9,400 ha currently dependent on rainfed cultivation by providing irrigation.
Approximately 7,000 farm families and 1,500 landless laborer's families, a
total of 8,500 would benefit directly from increased producton and employment.
The project would create a demand for an additional 390,000 man-days of farm
labor per year, equivalent to some 1,600 full-time jobs, and provide rice
farmers with increased access to markets through roads to be built under the
project. This component would meet the Government's objectives of increased
food production and more balanced interregional and intra-regional distribution
of development at a capital cost of about US$1,600 per benefited farm family.
At full agricultural development this component would result in an incremental
yearly paddy production of about 29,000 tons and an import saving of US$5.6 mil-
lion at the forecast world market prices.
6.02      Foreign Exchange.  The numeraire used for this analysis is the
uncommitted foreign exchange in the hands of the Government. The local costs
and benefits in pesos were multiplied by the standard conversion factor (SCF)
convert them to this numeraire.
6.03      Benefits.  The economic benefits, based on assumptions given in
Chapter 5 for smaller (<100 ha) and larger (> 100 ha) systems, are shown in
Annex 4.  For this analysis the whole area is assumed as rainfed at present,
and irrigated in the future with a cropping intensity of 160%.
6.04      Farm Labor.  Monthly labor demand for the project area was computed
for various sizes of systems and aggregated (Annex 4). For the economic
analysis, the shadow wage rate of P 2.7/man-day was used (based on experience
in other comparable Bank Group irrigation projects in the Philippines); by
comparison the peak season market wage rate is P 7.0/man day.
6.05      Investment Costs.  The total shadow-priced capital cost, expressed
in mid-1978 prices, is US$10.4 million. The average shadow-priced capital
cost per hectare is US$1,350 for systems smaller than 100 ha and US$1,130 for
systems greater than 100 ha in size. The annual O&M cost per hectare of
wet-season irrigated land was assumed about US$10/ha which is equal to the
present average cost on NIA national systems. All capital costs include
physical contingencies, but exclude costs due to price increases.

6.06      Development Period.  According to the project implementation
schedule, all works would be completed in time for the 1982 dry-season crop.
Systems smaller than 100 ha would have a three-year construction period as
compared to four years for systems larger than 100 ha. It was assumed
that each system would reach full development five years after completion of
construction.
6.07      Breakeven Cost of Construction.  Breakeven cost of construction is
defined as the construction cost to achieve a certain rate of return for the
assumptions stated earlier. The breakeven per hectare economic cost of
construction is summarized in Table 6.1 for smaller and larger systems.
Comparison of the estimated cost per hectare for each system of the project
with the breakeven cost shows that all systems in Abra, Kalinga-Apayao,
Aklan, Antique, and Capiz have an economic rate of return greater than 12%.
In Bohol, out of the seven systems, five have rates of return greater than
12%. The remaining two (a total of 450 ha) have a 9% economic rate of
return. Since these two systems have been proposed with impounding reser-
voirs, their future cropping intensity is expected to be higher than the
160% used for the above analysis. If their cropping intensity at full
development reaches 190%, their economic rates of return would be 11%.
6.08      Economic Rate of Return.  Using the foregoing assumptions and
the cost and benefit streams shown in Table 6.2, the overall rate of return
for the irrigation component is 21%.
6.09      Sensitivity Analysis.  Sensitivity of the breakeven economic cost
of construction and the overall economic rate of return was tested (Tables 6.3
and 6.4) to cost overruns, reduction and delay in benefits, increase in the
world market price of rice, decrease in projected rice yields and a decrease
and increase in cropping intensity. Under the severest effect,a drop in
cropping intensity to 130% (the threshold cropping intensity for system
inclusion), all systems in Abra, Kalinga-Apayao, Aklan, Antique and Capiz
have rates of return greater than 12%. In Bohol, three systems would have
rates of return greater than 12%, one a 10% rate of return (100 ha), one a 8%
rate of return (50 ha), and two a 7% rate of return (450 ha).
6.10      Risks.  No problems in implementation of construction are antici-
pated as NIA has ample experience with projects of similar scope. However, a
five year implementation period has been adopted to allow for the wide
geographic spread, smaller size of the systems and the fact that the staff
and resources of four regions and six provinces of NIA and FSDC would need to
be mobilized and deployed. The element of risk for the irrigation component
concerns: (a) the capacity of Irrigation Service Associations to take over
the responsibility of maintaining these systems to ensure the efficient use
of irrigation water. This risk has been minimized by ensuring that FSDC would
supervise the maintenance of the systems and monitor the performance of
the associations for five years after completion of construction; (b) the
provision of the entire package of agricultural supporting services to
smaller systems dispersed in all corners of the six provinces. This risk has
been taken into account by the expectation of lower rice yields of 2.5-3.0
tons/ha compared to 4.0 tons/ha in other Bank-assisted irrigation projects in
the Philippines.

Barangay Roads
6.11      The estimated 155 road segments which would total 1,386 km are
tentatively expected to improve access for some 78,000 families or 430,000
people at an average cost of US$365 per family. For the purposes of economic
evaluation, a typical barangay road in each of the project provinces was
analyzed. A similar evaluation will be done for each of the barangay roads
included in this component before implementation starts. The low-standard
access roads would link relatively isolated villages to the mainstream of
economic life of the provinces. Presently, these villages are accessible
only by dirt tracks, almost all of which are accessible only by foot or
animal-drawn sleds and sometimes only in the dry season. The dirt tracks are
primarily used to transport paddy and corn to the provincial road and sub-
sequently to the market. The farmers, their children, and hired labor
transport the paddy to the market. A number of farmers, due to the unavail-
ability of time, money, or labor, sell paddy to local middlemen in the
barangays for half the price available in the market. The low level of land
use and settlement are mainly due to lack of access to the market.
6.12      The importance of agricultural benefits due to barangay roads has
been highlighted in a study of 46 barangays in the Philippines. /1 It was
found that only two years after completion of the barangay roads, volume of
rice sold increased 24%, corn 104%, annual gross farm income and agricultural
land values increased 50%. Today, the effect of these roads on agricultural
production is expected to be considerably larger due to increasing population
pressures and better availability of support services. Interviews with
farmers show that they place a very high priority on roads for their develop-
ment. Farmers mention better access to market and substitution of jeepneys
and trishaws for animal and man-drawn sleds as the most important benefit of
these roads. Freeing children from transporting paddy and thus keeping them
in school was another.
6.13      The transport industry in the provinces is versatile and competi-
tive.  It is reasonable to assume that it would repond quickly to new oppor-
tunities and service villagers with a newly built road. Programs to raise
agricultural incomes are typically dependent on the availability of easy
access for extension services, inputs, and the marketing of output. In view
of the commitment of the Government to agricultural intensification and to
increasing of incomes of the rural poor, the lack of accessibility is a
serious constraint.
6.14      Reduction in Transport Costs.  Without the project, agricultural
inputs and outputs would be transported on an animal or man-drawn sled. An
animal-drawn sled can carry an average of 100 kg per trip at a speed of
2.0 km/hr. Since transportation of output takes place mainly during or
immediately after harvesting (when the peak wage rate is P 7/man-day), an average
shadow wage rate of P 5/man-day and P 5/animal-day has been used for man and
animal respectively. A lower shadow wage rate of P 2.7/man-day was used for
the irrigation component analysis since labor utilization in growing rice is

the Philippines, College of Agriculture, January 1958.

spread throughout the season. Therefore, the cost of transporting is P 6.25
per km-ton assuming an 8-hour working day. With the project, agricultural
inputs and outputs would be transported by light vehicles, such as jeepneys
and trishaws, at a cost of P 1.0 per km-ton based on field observations.
6.15      Agricultural Production.  In each of the provinces, a typical
barangay road was chosen for testing of economic viability. Survey teams of
the PPDS of the DPH, with the assistance of officials of BAE, BPI and local
barangay councils conducted a survey of the area of influence of each of these
test roads. They compiled data on major crop areas, production, prices,
transport costs, and potential areas for future production. The present
yields in the area of influence are 1.3 ton/ha for rice, 0.4 ton/ha for corn,
0.8 ton/ha for coconut, and 0.6 ton/ha for coffee. With the roads, it has
been assumed that 5 years after completion of the road, with availability of
some agricultural extension service, fertilizers and chemicals, yields would
increase modestly to 1.5 ton/ha for paddy, 0.6 ton/ha for corn, and 1.0
ton/ha for coconut. These estimated yields are below present nationwide
yields and are comparable to yields obtained in nearby areas accessible by
roads. Without the roads, it has been assumed that yields and area under
cultivation would remain unchanged. It has also been assumed that five years
after completion of a road all identified new potential areas for future
production, averaging about 20 ha per km of road, would be under cultivation.
This would mean an increase of between 50% and 60% in the area under culti-
vation in the test roads for Abra, Kalinga-Apayao, Aklan and Capiz, a 95%
increase for the test road in Antique, and a 20% increase for the test road
in Bohol. Assumptions regarding yields, prices and production costs for the
various crops and the areas, output and value of production, with and without
the project, for the various test roads are shown in Annex 2.
6.16      Investment Costs.  Average construction cost for the various test
roads is about US$18,100/km, ranging from US14,200/km in Bohol to US$20,600/km
in Abra. These costs are shadow-priced for foreign exchange content and
include 1,500 man-days/km of unskilled labor assuming that about half of the
construction would be done by labor-intensive techniques and the remaining
with equipment (details in Annex 4). Since the construction and maintenance
of these roads is done during the dry season, when demand for agricultural
labor is slack, a shadow wage rate of P 2.7/man-day has been used. All
capital costs include physical contingencies, but exclude costs due to price
increases. A three-year construction period with investment of 20% during the
first year and 40% for second and third year is assumed. Annual maintenance
costs have been calculated to be US$540/km. Periodic maintenance performed
every five years, has been calculated to cost US$1,350/ km. This cost
includes US$1,297/km for materials and US$53/km for equipment operation. The
salvage value of these roads after 20 years is assumed to be 50% of the
original cost of construction.
6.17      The cost and benefit streams and the rates of return for the
six test roads, using the producer surplus approach, are shown in Table 6.5.
The rates of return for the various test roads range from 10% in Abra to 24%
in Bohol. The relatively lower rates of return for the test roads in Abra

and Kalinga-Apayao is likely to be typical for most of the roads there. This
is due to the small area of influence per km and the higher costs of construction
per km due to the mountainous terrain.
6.18      Sensitivity Analysis.  Sensitivity of the economic rate of return
to a 20% cost overrun, cultivation of only 70% of the identified new area for
cultivation, and a ten-year build-up for new areas of cultivation instead of
five years is shown in Table 6.6. Under the severest condition, cultivation
of only 70% of the identified new area, all test roads would have rates of
return greater than 10% except the ones in Abra and Kalinga-Apayao. If the
investment in village roads were not undertaken in Abra and Kalinga-Apayao,
there is little that can be done to help these farmers who are some of the
poorest in the country.

6.19      Benefits.  The analysis provides only a partial picture of the
benefits of the roads component, which would also provide the people better
access to health and educational facilities. In the case of serious illness,
the absence of an all-weather road may result in a loss of life. These roads
would also enable children to spend more time in school instead of transporting
paddy; provide villagers better access to off-farm employment during the
off-season months in nearby towns; and enable farmers to grow labor-intensive,
higher value crops.
6.20      Risks.  Although BBR is relatively new, implementation of construction
is expected to be carried out reasonably well since an average of only 200 km
of roads per district have to be constructed over a period of four years.
Previous experience indicates that there has been some difficulty in the
maintenance of these roads. However, this risk has been minimized by providing
adequate funds for maintenance and obtaining assurances that the roads would
be maintained satisfactorily. The risk of possible overestimation of future
areas under cultivation has been examined in the sensitivity analysis.

Ports
6.21      The Government, in the feasibility report for the project, had
proposed five ports for rehabilitation under this component - San Jose de
Buena Vista port in the province of Antique, Culasi port in Capiz, Dumaguit
port in Aklan, and Tubigon and Talibon ports in Bohol. San Jose and Culasi
are the two main ports of their respective provinces. Dumaguit, if rehabili-
tated, has the potential to become the major port in Aklan. However, Tubigon
and Talibon are relatively minor ports in Bohol and are both connected by
badly maintained roads to the major port of Tagbilaran, only 60 km and 115 km
away respectively. Tubigon and Talibon ports were subsequently eliminated
from this component because of their proximity to the major port of Tagbilaran.
6.22        Though relatively small in size compared to national ports, these
ports are of major importance to the poor rural population whose inter-regional
connection and life line for transportation as well as marketing is based on
them. The ports' deteriorated condition results in goods being transported an
average of 150 km to other ports by inefficient roads. Most of these ports
handle the present traffic with difficulty and will not be F.ble to handle
increases in traffic unless facilities are rehabilitated. Eurther dilapida-
tion of ports included in this project would mean hardship and extra expense
for people travelling between the islands. Due to very scanty traffic data,
the estimates of future volume of traffic handled by the five project ports
and the estimates of potential volume of goods foregone due to the bad
condition of these ports were based on field observations and production and
export data of the provinces (for rice, corn, copra, fish and general merchan-
dise). Therefore, these estimates are only approximate.
6.23      Rehabilitation of the ports would start in 1979 and be completed by
1981. The increase in traffic would materialize by the end of 1980. With
the rehabilitation of the ports, volume is expected to increase from the
present 15,000 tons to 26,000 tons in 1986 for San Jose de Buena Vista, from
100,000 tons to 125,000 tons in Culasi, and from a negligible volume to about
10,000 tons in Dumaguit. After 1986, volume of traffic is assumed to remain
constant. These growth rates include a basic growth in the production of the
provinces and a diversion of goods transported by road. The economic evalua-
tion of the ports has been done by estimating the incremental volume of
traffic which would use the rehabilitated port instead of using the road to
the next nearest port. It has been assumed that the costs incurred at the
two ports is the same and therefore the saving is only the cost of transport
by road. The cost and benefit streams for the various ports is shown in
Table 6.7. The economic rate of return ranges from 15% for San Jose port to
30% for Culasi port.
Barangay Health Stations
6.24      This component consists of 60 barangay health stations which would
provide physical facilities and medical supplies to deliver first level
health care, family planning services, and nutrition advice to families in
the rural areas. The majority of these families cannot pay for such services

and presently have to travel considerable distances to the nearest town to
obtain them. The stations would include medical supplies, a waiting porch,
infants' examination room, storage room, toilet facilities, and a water
supply system and would be manned by a midwife trained by DOH in providing
health, family planning services, and nutrition advice.
6.25      The services provided would be aimed at infants, children, pregnant
women, and lactating mothers in an effort to reduce maternal and child
mortality and morbidity and increase the use of family planning services. A
smaller number of children in the individual household would mean that more
resources would be available for consumption and private savings. Living
standards of the rural population would improve, resulting in more food and
better nutrition for each family member, better material health and child
care, improved opportunities for education etc. The main beneficiaries of
the component would be the poorer families of the rural population, esti-
mated at 47,000, at a cosit of about US$19 per family.
Rural Water Supply
6.26      The project would provide about 300 village wells and thereby
improve considerably the availability and quality of water for about 100,000
villagers. The benefits from a safe and reliable water supply would arise
primarily from a reduction in water-borne diseases and the elimination of a
considerable amount of unproductive time and effort devoted to hauling water
over long distances. These benefits have not been quantified but are judged
to justify the small per capita investment of about US$15. The villagers
would contribute about 20% of the capital cost in the form of voluntary
labor, local materials and land. The villagers will, specifically, donate
land for access roads and location of wells, build access roads, fencing and
provide unskilled labor for construction and maintenance of the wells.
Weighted Economic Rate of Return
6.27      The weighted average rate of return for the irrigation component,
the base cost of which is US$11.4 million, is 21%. The rate of return for
the road component, based on the results of the six test roads, is 15% for an
investment of US$ 31.0 million. The average rate of return for the ports is
25% for a cost of US$ 2.2 imillion. The weighted economic rate of return for
these three components, which account for 90% of the total project costs, is
17%. Benefits from the health and water supply components have not been
quantified.
