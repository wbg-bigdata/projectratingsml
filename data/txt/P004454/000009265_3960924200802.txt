PREFACE
This is a Project Completion Repo-t (PCR) on the Rural Infra-
structure Project-I, for which an IDA credit in the amount of US$28.0
million to the government was approved on April 21, 1978. The credit was
closed after two extensions totalling 2-1/2 years on June 30, 1986. The
undisbursed balance of US$6.5 million was cancelled.
The Project Completion Report (PCR) was prepared by the Department
of Public Works and Highways of the Government and an Overview of the PCR
was prepared by the Agriculture Operations Division, Country Department II,
of the Asia Regional Office. The PCR Overview is based on a review of the
Staff Appraisal and the President's Reports, the credit documents, other
records on Bank files, and on discussions with Bank staff.
This PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED).
The draft PCR was sent to the Borrower on May 31, 1989, for comments by
June 20, 1989, but none were received.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PHILIPPINES
RURAL INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT
(CREDIT 790-PH)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Objectives
1.       The Philippine Rural Infrastructure Project-I was an effort by the
Government of the Philippines to raise the socio-economic conditions of the
rural population in six provinces by providing relatively small-scale infra-
structure works. The project aimed to establish: (a) communal irrigation
systems; (b) barangay (village) roads; (c) small ports; (d) barangay health
stations; and (e) rural water supply facilities.
Implementation
2.       IDA Credit 790-PH for  US$28  million  became  effective on July 20,
1978. This represented the entire foreign exchange component of the project,
or 48 percent of the total cost of US$59 million. At appraisal, disburse-
ments were expected to be completed by December 31, 1983, one year after the
scheduled completion of all  project  works.   However, the implemenLaLion of
the project took about four years longer than predicted at the time of ap-
praisal. Delays were caused by severe weather conditions, lengthy adminis-
trative procedures, peace-and-order problems, shortages of materials, con-
tract modificati ns necessitated by price increases, funding delays and
contractor difficulties.
3.       Difficulties that arose in the renegotiation of the fees of
consultants involved in the detailed engineering phase of the barangay roads
project delayed construction bidding for almost two years. Some of the sites
proposed for roads or irrigation systems were found tc have low expected
economic returns or to present technical difficulties, so they were abandoned
in favor of more favorable locations. Ports also suffered delays mainly due
to the inability of the contractors to finish the work because of rising costs
and technical difficulties. The health station and rural water supply
components experienced some slippages, but were generally completed on time.
Due to lower than expected costs, the number of water systems constructed
under the rural water supply component increased to 477 from the appraisal
proposal of 300.   Overall management and coordination of work among the
different agencies responsible for the different components was also more
complicated than anticipated at appraisal.
Results
4.       By the end of tho extended project period, about 90% of project targets
had been met. A total of 1,012 km of barangay roads were constructed or upgrad-
ed, including 110 km of access roads to communal irrigation systems and health
stations. This represented about 73% of appraisal. Post-project economic



v 
analysis shows an increase of land put undtr cultivation and an increase in
the value of production due to the roads.   With the completion of the
irrigation component, 43 communal irrigation facilities were constructed or
improved. The area provided with irrigation facilities increased from the
appraisal estimate of 9,400 ha to 9,589 ha. The PCR assumes somewhat higher
yields and zropping intensities than those used at appraisal.  These values
are not unrealistic for small communal systems, where intense farming efforts
are exercised.  As planned, 60 health stations were completee  serving about
213,800 patients in 1985. The main beneficiaries were the estimated 132,500
poorer families in the area. Construction on two of the three ports targeted
for rehabilitation has been completed, while work continues on the third.
Traffic at these ports has risenL significantly from 1975 to 1985; in San Jose
de Buenavista, from 15,000 tons to 26,000 tons; in Dumaguit, from a negligible
amount to 10,000 tons; in Culasi, from 100,000 tons to 125,000 tons.
5.       The project ERR varies among the different components, but overall
the returns are quite good. Based on the post-project economic analysis, 11
of the 13 test barangay roads showed returns between 11.82 and 23.8:, compared
to the appraisal projection of 15Z. Based on an analysis of eight sample
irrigation systems, the project ERR is about 30Z, com,ared to the appraisal
projection of 212. Ports also show a positive ERR, with returns at 182 at San
Jose de Buenavista, 23Z at Dumaguit and 342 at Culasi, compared to the average
of 25Z anticipated at appraisal. The ERR was not calculated for the rural
health station or water supply component,-, but the relatively low costs, at
US$4 per family for health care and US$26 per person for water supply, are
judged to be justifiable when compared with the observed benefits.
Disbursements and Costs
6.       The Credit Ciosing Date was extended by two and a half years from
December 31, 1983 to June 30, 1986, to enable completion of the balance of the
project, especially road construction. US$21.5 million of the US$28 million
had been utilized by the expiry of the credit.
7.      The final project cost in US dollar terms was US$48.3 million, some
US$ll million (18Z) lower than the appraisal cost estimates of US$59 million.
The final project cost in local currency equivalent was considerably higher
(42Z) than the appraisal estimate (P 436.6 million at appraisal cf. P 618.5
million final cost).
Sustainability
8.       The project design concentrated mainly on implementation aspects
and made only passing references, largely through legal covenants, to
maintenance of the facilities after construction. At the time of appraisal
maintenance problems were well known to the Bank and were raised as issues
during processing. Poor or inadequate mainternance is a problem affecting
the sustainability of these infrastructure investments. In particular,
there has been little maintenance of any of the rural roads financed under
the project (the largest component) and none have been transferred to a
maintenance basis. These problems have a national perspective, however,
reflecting overall resource constraints and policies, such that project-
specific maintenance deficiencies are difficult to resolve.

9.        In forecating  the  implementation  schedule,  the appraisal mission
could have taken a more  realistic  view  of  some  of the factors which could
hinder  implementation,  including:       speed  and  efficiency  of  goverrnent
procedures; likelihood or frequent difficult weather conditions; geographleal
dispersion of project works; contractor availability and quality; possible
peace and order problems; likelihood of the need to modify enginoering designs
and works contracts; financial difficulties likely to face the country.
10.       The design and  costing  of  specific  works  such  as ports were not
sufficiently advanced at appraisal, as seen by the difficulties encountered in
implementation.  Although more flexibility was possible during implementation
in respect to smaller, less complex infrastructure (e.g., rural roads,
irrigation, water supply and health facilities), port construction requires
careful preliminary planning and design.



PHILIPPINES
RURAL INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT-I (CREDIT 790-PH)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Overview
(General
1.       Thii  v'-,erv lew is based on the Project Completion Report (PCR) of the
Philippine R-i: Tnr:rastructure Project-I (PRIP-I) prepared by the Department
of Public Works arn1 Highways (DPWH), the implementing agency of the Government
of the Philip.f'i.z"- GOP), and on the Bank's Appraisal Report, President's
Report, Credit Agreeuient, Bank supervision mission reports and informacion in
relevant Bank -' Ies. The PCR reflects the findings and opinions of Government
officials closely .ssociated with the project and, in general, presents an
objective view of project implementation, performance and impact.
The Project
2.       Proiect jje cctives.  PRIP-I was an effort by GOP to raise the  socio-
economic conditions of the rural population in  six provinces, namely Abra,
Kalinga-Apayda, Bohol, Aklan, Antique and Capiz, which were selected on the
1,asis of their low k vel of per capita income and the need for rural
infrastruct.ral tacilities.  This multi-sectoral, integrated project was
(ieSignedi primarl  to provide relatively small-scale infrastructure works in
these provinces. The project aimed to establish: (a) communal irrigation
systems: {   'Paaiigay (village) roads; (c) small ports; (d) barangay health
stat-ions:  ei rural water supply facilities; and (f) proposals for a follow-up
r ro oe e t
i.       Thel irterent components of the project were meant to be
';omrlemertary. isolated rural farmers having few marketing opportunities
lacked the marerial incentives and technical support necessary to maximize
crop yields.  '.isth the construction of roads to ensure convenient access to
market, ifrlgdi,r'r systems to improve the yields, health stations and wells,
the :iving staan.tards of the target population were to be raised.
. ,aL^iv e>J,ads. This component aimed to construct or upgrade 1,386
km of sir.guie 7ane, all-weather roads, which would benefit some 78,000 families
or 43v,0JO inhabitants, This would consist of about 150 road stretches
Xaringllg an length f rom three to 17 km. Location of the roads was based on the
crlteria ot' a ii;inimum of two villages and/or a population of 100 inhabitants
per km- t.' !r served, and a minimum economic rate of return of 10?.
'. >.eie ;w-standard access roads would link relatively isolated
..e maInstream of economic life of the provinces.  Before the
,   -:i.ages were accessible only by dirt tracks the majority of
ih l 'e!- _r      a  condition, and often only by foot or animal-drawn sleds
X.e :  . e:e-~-~  !.- r' tiring the dry season.  The dirt tracks were used by the



-2-
farmers, their children and hired labor to transport paddy and corn to the
prwvincial roads and then to market. Some farmers due to the lack of time,
money or labor, sold paddy to local middlemen for half the price ava,lable in
nearby markets.
6.       Coo inal Irritation Systems.  The appraisal report ptoposed the
construction of 53 new irrigation systems ranging in size from 50 ha to 1,100
ha, serving about 6,500 ha. and the rehabilitation of two systema serving
about 900 ha. Approzimately 7,000 farm families and 1,500 landless laborers'
families would benefit. In the absence of the project, the rate of increase
in rice yields was estimated at about 0.5Z each year, due mainly to some
marginal improvDemnts in application of inputs. With the project, the
projected yield at full development was expected to rise from 1.5 tons/ha to
2.5 to 3.0 tons/ha. The selection of the areas was based on the criteria of a
minimum cropping intensity of 130S, farm size of 1.0 to 1.5 ha or less for at
least 70Z of the farms and a minimum economic rate of return of 102.
7.       Ports.  The project aimed to rehabilitate and expand the port
facilities in one municipal and two national ports. Though relatively small
in size, these ports are of major importance to the poor rural inhabitants who
depend on them for inter-regional communication. The appraisal report
estimated traffic in the ports would rise significantly from 1975 to 198g. An
increase in fishing activities also increased the need for pogt renovation.
Without rehabilitation, the degradation of the ports would cb6tinue. More
goods would have to be transported by truck to and from the port at Iloilo, an
average of 150 km away, increasing transportation costs. Upgrading and
rehabilitating the selected ports would reduce turnaround times and handling
costs of ships and cargoes, and encourage the introduction of larger and more
efficient vessels in inter-island trade, The improvement works included
extension or realignment of breakwaters, installation of navigational aids,
reclaiming and surfacing for storage area ind provision of independent water
supply.
8.       Health Stations.  About 60 rural health stations located in villages
appioximately 5-10 km from a rural health unit were to be constructed under
the project. These stations would provide family planning and nutritional
services as well as basic health care. Each station would be built on a
publicly owned 300 sq m plot of land with a floor area of about 50 sq m.
Since some of the stations in the provinces had no access roads, these would
be provided under the barangay road component.
9.       Rural Water Supply. The proposed 300 wells would be drilled with
drilling depths varying from six m to about 100 m depending on the aquifer
characteristics, and the wells equipped with standard hand pumps. Easy access
to the wells would be ensured, a concrete basin facility for washing clothes
provided at each site. Wells would be at least 300 m apart, and villagers
would be responsible for providing land for the well and maintaining the well
after construction.
Proiect Cost and Financing
10.      The total estimated cost of the project was US$59 million.  IDA
Credit 790-PH for US$28 million was signed on April 21, 1978, representing the



-3-
entire foreign exchange component of the project. or 482 of the total cost.
The remaining US$31 million was to be provided by the Government.
ImDlementation
11.      The Credit was signed Dy  the Executive Directors on April 21, 1978,
and became effective on July 20. 1978. At appraisal, disbursements were
expected to be completed by December 31, 1983. one year after the scheduled
completion of all project works. However, project implementation took about
four years longer than predicted at appraisal. The main factors responsible
for the delay include severe weather conditions, Government's lengthy
administrative procedures, peace and order problems, funding delays and
contractor difficulties. The barangay roads component suffered especially
long delays, the first due to the renegotiation of consultant quotations for
detailed engineering because of the Bank's view that these quotations were too
high. Also shortages of materials caused delays in the roads and ports
components. Coordination between the different implementing agencies was not
as smooth as expected, and the diversity and geographic dispersion of the
individual works made overall management difficult.
12.      The Credit was extended for two and a half years, to June 30, 1986.
By the end of March 1986, overall project completion was abo4t 90?.  The
irrigation system, water supply and health station components were 1001
complete. The barangay roads component suffered from peace add order and
right-of-way problems, contractor difficulties, delayed fund releases and bad
weather, and was only 73S complete by the end of the project. Two of the
three ports were completed, the other only about 60? completed; delays were
due to the lack of funds, redesign of the project and contract adjustment.
The PCR has listed most of the causes of delays in project implementation with
which this Overview agrees. However, the PCR does not mention the delays
caused by inadequate allocation of local funds for project implementation by
GOP, due to severe financial constraints.
13.      Barangav Roads.  A total of 1,012 km of roads were constructed or
upgraded, against an apprais~al target of 1,386 km, under this component.
Barangay roads were divided into two groups, those to be constructed by the
DPWH and ti.ose to be constructed by contractors. Out of a total number of 140
road sections, 66 sections with an aggregate length of 671 km were subject to
contract bidding by prequalified contractors. The original target date for
bidding was set in September 1978 but due to high rates quoted by the local
consultants for the detailed engineering phase, the Bank suggested
renegotiation of the bids on the detailed engineering phase. This delayed the
bidding on roads until mid-1980, delaying commencement of construction by
almost two years (see PCR paras. 3.02-3.08). Many contracts suffered delays.
The most prevalent causes were: unavailability of equipment and materials and
lack of working capital in the case of many contractors; delay by government
in acquisition of right-of-way and relocation of utilities; poor organization
and management among most contractors; time consuming government procedures
for processing interim payments, and contract modifications. Other delays
stemmed from the reorganization of the Ministry of Public Works and Highways,
severe weather conditions and sporadic peace and order problems. Among the
total road projects under contract, 42? were completed on time while the rest
experienced delays ranging from less than a year to three years. About 10S of



-4-
the contract projects were either cancelled or rescinded and then completed by
DPWH. Almost all of the road sections implemented by DPWH are reported to
have been completed on time (see PCR paras. 3.02-3.08).
14.      Communal Irrifation.  The impiementation of this component was
undertaken by the National Irrigation Administration (NIA). Of the 51 new
irrigation systems planned at appraisal, 22 were constructed. Since others
were found to be uneconomical or to present technical difficulties, 21
alternative systems were rehabilitated instead. The total area developed is
reported as 9,589 ha against an appraisal target of 9,400 ha. Some minor
delays were caused by errors in design and construction of four systems,
right-of-way problems due to disagreement of some farmers to the constructior4
of on-farm facilities, and in some cases the lack of cooperation of Irrigator
Association (IA) members. Farmer beneficiaries were involved in the
formulation, design and construction of most of the 43 systems, and are
responsible for their operation and maintenance (see PCR paras. 3.09-3.10).
The construction of the 43 communal sub-projects started in July 1978 and was
completed close to Rcnedule, in December 1983. The constructed systems had
already been turned over to their respective Irrigation Associations when
typhoons and strong floods hit the region in 1984 and 1985, causing some
damage. The repair work was completed in May 1986.
15.      BaranRay Health Stations.  The Bureau of Public Works of the
Department of Public Works, Transportation and Communication (DPWTC) was
responsible for the design, construction and supervision of the health
stations while the Project Management Staff of the Department of Health (DOH)
was responsible for contract administration and procurement of supplies and
materials and operation. Construction began in 1979, and the 60 stations
became operational in 1983. However the complete equipping and furnishing of
these stations was finished only in 1985, mainly due to a lack of coordination
between the implementing agencies.
:6.      Ports.  The Bureau of Public Works of DPWTC was responsible for the
design and construction of ports, with contractors taking on most of the
actual construction work. Slippages occurred on all projects, mainly due to
the inability of the contractors to finish the work in time because of rising
costs, technical difficulties and political cactors. The port at Culasi was
87S finished in 1982, when the contract was terminated because the contractor
was unable to finish the work. Another contractor finished the job in 1983.
The port of San Jose de Buenavista was 99Z complete when the newly constructed
breakwater was damaged by a typhoon in 1982 and the contract terminated in
1983. Other contractors continued the project, completing all work in April
1986. Work at the Dumaguit port (about 60t accomplished) has yet to be
completed, due mainly to  deficiencies in the origina. pile foundation design
and contractual problems which followed as a result, which Government failed
to resolve in time (see PCR paras. 3.14-3.17). Government will complete this
work using local funds.
17.      Rural Water Supply.  The Bureau of Public Works of DPWTC was
responsible for the implementation of rural water supply systems. The
drilling of wells was started on time. A total of 462 wells were initially
drilled of these 25 wells were abandoned due to problems such as salty or
muddy water or shale formation. Noting the availability of more funds due to



p.                            -~~~~~~~~~~~~5-
lower than anticipated unit costs, DPWTC continued to construct 40 more water
supply systems with Bank approval. Of the 477 serviceable wells constructed
:bout 31 are not currently operational because of poor maintenance (see PCR
paras. 3.18-3.19).
18.      PreDaration of Future Proiect.  No work was performed on the
component, due apparently to a decision between the Bank and Government not to
have a follow-up project of this type.
19.      Disbursements and Costs.  Disbursement of Credit 790-PH lagged well
behind appratsal estimates throughout the project implementation period. The
Credit Closing Date was extended by two and a half years from December 31,
1983 to June 30, 1986, to permit completion of the remaining works,
especially road construction. US$21.5 million (of a total of US$28 million)
was utilized of by the close of the Credit and the balance was cancelled (see
PCR paras. 4.04-4.06, Annex 4.07.1).
20.      The final project cost in US dollar terms, was US$48.3 million, some
US$11 million or 182 lower than the appraisal estimate of US$59 million,
mainly due to the devaluation of Philippine currency. However, the final
project cost in local currency equivalent is higher than the 0appraisal
estimate by about 42Z. from Pesos 436.6 million at appraisal to,Pesos 618.5
million final cost.
Proiect Impact
21.      Overall.  The major objectives of the project were met by providing
1,012 km of all-weather road access to markets, health stations and irrigation
systems for the rural population; irrigating 9,589 ha of farmland to increase
the yield of rural agricultural production; providing 60 rural health stations
to promote health and serve the medical needs of the rural population;
improving the rural water supply system by constructing 477 rural water supply
systems to provide safe and potable drinking water; finishing construction of
two ports to promote transportation and shipping, with work continuing on a
third. By the end of the project, about 90Z of the appraisal targets were
completed.
22.      Barangay Roads.  A total of 1,012 km of barangay roads were
constructed or upgraded through the project. Because of sparse population or
difficult terrain, some of the sites originally proposed were found
inappropriate. Roads with higher rates of expected economic returns and lower
construction costs replaced those which were dropped.
23.      The appraisal mission had analyzed 6 barangay road projects to
evaluate the economic viability of this component. The post-project
reassessment study used the same methodology but analyzed 13 sample roads,
with some adjustments of prices and costs to the 1986 level (see PCR paras.
6.01-6.04). The appraisal mission determined that a satisfactory ERR would be
102; the post-project evaluation calculates the ERR to be satisfactory on 11
of the of 13 projects, ranging from 11.8Z to 23.8? (see PCR para. 6.05,
Annexes 6.05.1 to 6.05.13).



-6-
24.      Greater access to markets, and substitution of jeepneys and trishaws
for animal and man-drawn sleds has probably been the greatest benefit of the
new barangay roads. Agricultural production has increased from both the
increase in crop yields (see PCR Annex Table 6.04.7) and the opening up of new
areas to cultivation. The appraisal report assumed that five years after
completion of a road all identified new potential areas for future production,
averaging about 20 ha per km of road, would be under cultivation. According
to the 1987 economic analysis of the six km Sevilla-Bilar road section, total
area under cultivation would remain constant at 1985 levels without road
construction, at 1,945 ha, but with the road this would increase to 2,143 ha
by 1990, an increase of 198 ha or 102. On this sub-project, new land put
under cultivation increased 33 ha per km of road built, higher than the
appraisal estimates. The economic analysis also predicts an increase in the
value of production, from P 7,161,000 in 199n without the roads to P 9,792,00i
with the roads, an increase of 36?. All-weather roads are also expected to
give inhabitants greater access to health and educational facilities.
According to the appraisal report, children should be able to spend more time
in school instead of transporting paddy, villagers have better access to off-
farm employment during the off-season months in nearby towns, and farmers can
grow labor-intensive, higher value crops, but these points are not mentioned
in the PCR.
25.      Communal Irrigation.  With the completion of the irrigation
component, 43 communal irrigation facilities were constructed or improved.
This included the construction of 22 new irrigation systems serving 5,274 ha
and the rehabilitation of 21 existing systems serving 4,315 ha. Of these 43
implemented projects, 28 were included in the appraisal listing and 15 systems
were new inclusions. The appraisal report proposed the establishment of about
53 new communal irrigation projects serving about 8,500 ha and the
rehabilitation of 2 old systems serving 900 ha, a total of 9,400 ha, but due
to various factors, including the low expected economic returns of some
proposed systems, lack of water, steep slope and high construction costs, some
of the originally planned systems were not built. Despite the reduction in
the number of projects implemented, the area provided with irrigation
facilities increased from the appraisal estimates of 9,400 ha to 9,589 ha.
26.      At appraisal the overall ERR for this component was estimated at 21?.
The feasibility report on which appraisal was based presented ten representa-
tive communal irrigation systems as test projects that were subjected to
detailed feasibility studies. For purposes of comparison, the economic re-
evaluation in the PCR has been limited to the studied systems and the
procedure carried out as in the feasibility studies (see PCR paras. 6.06.10).
The projects costs used in the post-project analysis were adjusted to 1986
levels for the evaluation. On this basis the ERR of the sampLe systems is
higher than the feasibility study estimates. The higher ERR is attributable
to a larger service area, higher yields and cropping intensities, higher
farmgate price and, in some cases, reduction in project costs. The ERRs range
from 17.0Z to 47.2? (30? weighted average) in the PCR, higher than the
feasibility study estimates in all but two cases (see PCR paragraph 6.10), and
higher than the appraisal estimate.
27.      The average cropping intensity increased from an estimated 164? to
174?, increasing the total effective area from 15,400 ha to 16,705 ha (see PCR



-7-
paras. 3.22, 3.23, Annex 3.22.1). The average cost of construction was
estimated as P 6,920 per ha, compared with P 8,800 per ha estimated by the
appraisal report (see PCR Annex 3.22.1). The operation and maintenance cost
(o&0) was predicted to be US$10 per ha by the appraisal report, about the same
as the P 200 estimated for 1986 in the PCR (see PCR Annex 6.09.1). Crop
yields on irrigated land increased; for example, at the Madua-San Isidro
Comnunal Irrigation System in Bohol, yields of rice in 1987 are an estimated
3.28 tons/ha for both the first and second planting. Without the project,
yields would only be about 2.5 toils/ha for the first planting and 2.2 tons/ha
for the second planting (see Economic Analysis tables, Irrigation Component).
Yields also increased for other crops. Projected maximum yield levels
estimated by PCR are generally high.er than those predicted by the appraisal
report (see PCR Annex 6.04.8).
28.      Health Stations.  As planned, 60 health stations were completed and
made operational in 1983.  Some of the units were constructed in new sites
because of poor access to the proposed sites or low population in the area
(see PCR paras. 3.28-3.29). These clinics provide family planning and
nutrition services as well as basic health services. PCR reports a total of
213,760 patients served in 1985 (see PCR Annexes 6.11.1). Although the
influence of health care is difficult to quantify, PCR notes that in 1985
total crude deaths in the areas were 12,893, 18.6Z lower thon the 15,839
before the opening of the station in 1979. Infant mortality dropped 43.81.
The drop in death rate and child mortality may have some correapondence with
the establishment of the health care stations, but other factors may also be
involved. The main beneficiaries of the health stations are the estimated
132,503 poorer families of the area. Total cost comes to about US$4 per
family (see PCR paras. 6.11-6.13, Annex 6.11.1).
29.      Ports.  Two national ports end one municipal port were targeted for
rehabilitation and improvement. The work on the ports of Culasi in Capiz and
San Jose de Buenavista in Antique are completed. Due to a deficiency in the
design of the concrete pile foundations for the wharf, resulting design
changes and problems with contractors, the work on the Dumaguit in Aklan port
(about 601 done) has not yet been completed (see PCR paras. 3.24-3.27).  At
appraisal, it was predicted that traffic at the three ports would rise
significantly from 1975 to 1985; in San Jose de Buena Vista, from 15,000 tons
to 26,000 tons, in Dumaguit from a negligible amount to 10,000 tons, and in
Culasi from 100,000 tons to 125,000 tons. In the post-project re-evaluation
of the port project, the evaluation method used in the appraisal is adopted.
This assumed that without improvement these ports would have difficulty
handling traffic and would not be able to handle traffic increases unless
facilities were rehabilitated. Despite the uncompleted status of the port of
Dumaguit, it is still evaluated based on the assumption that the existing
cargo and passenger traffic in Washington will be transferred to Dumaguit when
it opens (see PCR para. 6.16). With rehabilitation, total cargo handled is
slightly above the appraisal estimates (see PCR para. 6.15). Post-project ERR
was slightly higher than the appraisal evaluation, at 18? at San Jose de
Buenavista, 231 at Dumaguit, and 341 at Culasi (see PCR para. 6.18,
Annex 6.18.1) against appraisal projections of 15?, 21Z and 302 respectively.
30.      Rural Water Supply.  The 300 wells proposed at appraisal were drilled
at well under appraisal cost, due to the availability of equipment and lower



-8-
than expected drilling depths. Wells were constructed at the health care
stations and other sites. A total of 477 wells were constructed. The rural
water supply project has provided a safe and reliable watcr supply for about
110,000 villagers. This should lead to a reduction in water-borne diseases
and elimination of the necessity of hauling water over long distances. These
benefits have not been quantified. but are judged to justify the small per
capita investment of about US$26.
Bank Performance
31.      The PCR notes that the project was in agreement with the Government's
efforts to raise the socio-economic conditions in the project area. The PCR
comments that the implementation schedule prepared by the Bank's appraisal
mission was overly optimistic and did not allow for lengthy administrative
procedures and delays due to difficult weather conditions and security issues
(see PCR para. 7.02). Although these factors may not have been fully
appreciated at appraisal, other delays, such as those due to the lack of local
funding, were also major factors.
32.      The PCR credits the Bank with making valuable suggestions and
recommendations, and with following-up problems that could have further
aggravated implementation delay if they were not resolved iptime.  Among the
assistance noted was that given to the strengthening and supp&rt of staff,
procurement of equipment and advice on financial matters including the
extension of the Bank Credit (see PCR paragraph 7.03.)
33.      Mention was also made of the 'negative attitudes' of the Bank toward
the bidding procedures on barangay roads, and the lack of understanding of
some Bank members, particularly during the early stages of implementation.
This, 'caused disenchantment among field officials and resulted in lukewarm
cooperation' (see PCR paragraph 7.02).
Lessons Learned
34.      The implementation schedule prepared by the Bank's appraisal appears
to have been overly optimistic. Some factors, such as: speed and efficiency
of Government procedures; likelihood of frequent severe weather conditions;
geographical spread of project works; contractor availability and quality;
possible peace and order problems; likely funding difficulties; etc. are
common to several projects and deserve a deeper appreciation.
35.      The roads and ports projects suffered the longest delays, each
containing some sub-projects that needed redesigning. The redesign and
relocation of some of the roads were unavoidable due to the large area
involved and variations in terrain. Allowances for such changes appear
inadequate, considering the overall environment. The necessity of redesigning
the port facilities at Dumaguit, however, indicates inadequate preparatory
work by the time of project appraisal. Hiring dnd retaining good contractors
was difficult in both the roads and ports components, and projects were
consequently delayed. This emphasizes the importance of thoroughly reviewing
all important construction designs for works of this nature and carefully
evaluating contractor capability and availability.
36.      Although rearly impossible, there is a need for measures to expedite
and improve the efficiency of novernment procedures.

PHILIPPINES
PHJLIPPINE RURAL INSFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT-LOAN 790-PH
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I.   ACKGRO=N
1.0l            On  April  21.1978.   the  Government  of   the
Philippines signed a credit agreement with International
Development Association (IDA) of the World Bank for a loan
amounting   to $28 million (Loan No.  790-PH) representing the
foreign exchange component (48% of the total project cost) for
the  financing of the Philippine Rural Insfracture   Project-I
(PRIP-I). a multi-sectoral Rural Insfrastructure Project in
six (6)  provinces namely: Abra in Ilocos Region (I)  , Kalinga
Apayao in Cagayan Valley Region (II). Aklan. Anttpie and CApiz
in Western Visayas Region (VI) and Bohol in Central Visayas
Region (VII).    These provinces were selected on the basis  of
-heir low level of per capita income and the need for rural
insfratructure  facilities.   The project  components  include
communal irrigation systems, barangay (village) roads, small
ports, barangay health stations and rural wa:e7 supply.
1.02            The  project  implementation   was   undertaken
under  the  supervision of various government  agencies.   The
National Irrigation Ad,ninistration (NIA) was responsible for
the construction and improvement of irrigation system. The
Ministry of Public Highways and the Ministry of Public Works
that were merged into the Ministry of Public Works and
Highways and now the Department of Public Works and Highways,
handled the construction and improvement of barangay          roads
through   the   Bureau  of  Barangay  Roads  (BBR)   are   the
construction of barangay health stations, community water
supply   and   ports  through  Bureau  of  Public   Works   in
coordination with the Ministry of Health and the Philippine
Ports Authority.
1.03            The total estimated cost of the ProJect is  $59
M of which S28.OOM is in foreign exchange.   As mentioned. the
foreign exchange cost of the Project was fully financed
through  the IDA credit of $23.OOM.   The government  provided
the remaining estimated S31.00M to the implementing line
agencies from annual budget appropriations. The amount of the
loan   were  divided  among  the  implementing   agencies   in
approximately the followina proportions:
A G ENCY aXPERCENT
NIA              2%
DPWH & DOH        63%
GEN. PROJ. MGT.  12%

2.01            The  Government's thrust to mobilize the  rural
sector in the development Stream has come up with a ru"al
development croeram designed to uplift the socio--conomic
conditions  in the rural *reas.   One of the current  national
development  strategy for rural deveiopment is the  integrated
area  de-elnn-ment Aporoa^% which a number of ongoing/completed
rural development projects has been framed up along this
concept.
2.02            In   early  1977,  the  National  Economic  and
Development Authority in coordination with various government
agencies has come up with a concept paper for a multi-sectoral
Rural Infrastructure Project designed primarily to provide
relatively small-scale infrastructure works in the provinces
of Abra. Kalinga-Apayao. Bohol. Aklan. Antique and Capiz.
2.03            Through  the  assistance  from  FAO-World  Bank
Cooperative Program and International Development- Aosociation
(IDA). a Bank Appraisal Mission visited the Philippines in
April 1977 to discuss with the Government the possibility of
formulating the proposed proJect.   Subsequently,  a follow-up
Bank Appraisal Mission visited in October 1977 tv further
review and discusi various aspects of the project.
2. 04           Proaect  evaluation  started b;' requiring  each
acency   concernde  to  review  their   respective   ten-year
development pzogram (1977-86, and identified schemes to meet
the  immediate needs of the  population.   Irrigation  schemes
were initlally evaluated on the basis of laad and water
resources,   willingness   of  farmer's  to  participate   and
preliminary cost of development; barangay roads were selected
accordtng to potential pzoduction area and the need fcr
preliminary  field  surveys  of  alignment  and  cost;   ports
according to alternative means of transportation and cost of
impro"fement; rural health stations, according to the location
of rural health units and their distance to the villages to be
served;  and  water  supply.  according to the .need  of  small
villages.   Based  on this preliminary  evaluation,   detailed
feasibility studies were carried out in 1978 for irritation
system which covered 25% of the project area and were
representative of terrain, soils and type of diversion. Cost
estimates of the road component were based on three road
segments  representing  the  terrain;   and  11  segments  for
potential production area.   Plans and detailed cost estimates
were prepared for each port, barangay ,-ealth station and the
equipment for rural water supply.

2.05            Based  on  the findings and recommendations  of
the appraisal mission. the project consisted of the following:
(a)  (Offiflunal T         Dav.loom
construction of about 53 new irrigation system serving
some 8,500 ha and rehabilitation of two existing system
serving 900 ha;
(b)  Banrsv Roads
(i) construction of about 820 km of new and upgrading of
about 240 km of existing barangay roads; construction of
about 290 km of new access roads to serve the proposed
communal irrigation system. and of about 40 km of access
roads to serve the proposed barangay health stations in
Abra and Kalinga-Apayao provinces; and
(ii) engagement of highway engineer and consulting firms
to assist with detailed engineering, design, supervision
of construction and maintenance of the project roads.
(c)  Ports
rehabilitation and improvement of two national ports and
one municipal port.
(d) Baranzav Health Stations
(i) construction of 60 health stations; and
(ii)    procurement  of  medical   equipment,   furniture,
supplies and minor instruments for the proposed health
stations.
(e)  Rua'pl Waer_f'SPPlv
(i)   procurement of drilling equipmenz and materials for
the construction of about 300 wells; and
(ii)   provision  for training and strengthening  of  the
existing staff of the Bureau of Public Works (BPW) at the
center and in the six project provinces.
The project would also make provision for the preparation of a
future  rutral  infrastructure  project  in  ten provinces  to be
selected by the Government.

A.  Loan o    poetiveness
3.01            Loan negotiations took  lace in Washington from
March 6 to .0. 1978 for the project amounting to US$ 28.0
million.   The  loan was signed by the Executive Directors  c,"
April 21.  1978 and become effective on May 6, 1978. The loan
was payable within a period of 40 years excluding a 10 years
grace period.   It bears an interest rate of 1/2 of 1  percent
per annum of the principal amount of the loan withdrawn and
outstanding  from time to time.   The  Philippine  government.
however, pays a commitment charge at the rate of 3/4 of 1
percent   per   annum  not  withdrawn  from  time   to   time.
Amortization of the loan on semi-annual payments commenced on
June  15.   1978.    The  Government  did  not  encounter  any
difficulty   in   complying  with  the  conditions  for   loan
effectiveness set out in the loan documents.

3.02            The implementation of barangay roads  including
the road access tc the communal irrigation systems and
barangay health stations were divided into two (2) groups,
those   implemented   by  administration  (DPWH)   and   those
implemented by Contractors. Out of a total number of 140 road
sections. 66 road sections with an aggregate length of 671
kms. were subjected for contract bidding by prequalified
contractors.    Bidding  wa£ carried out in 4  major  packages
with 21 sub-packages consisting of 7a contracts, includinz
separate contracts for 5 bridge construction, each ranginZ in
estimated  cost  from a low of P0.5 million to a  maximum   of
P12.2 million.   The original target date for bidding was  set
in  September 1978 but due to high rates quoted by the   local
consultants during the detailed engineering phase, the Bank
suggested  renegotiation  of  the  bids.   This  delayed   the
bidding process until mid 1980.   Contractors were given   the
option of bidding individual contracts or combinations   which
resulted  in generally good competition,  all contracts   were
awarded to domestic contractors.
3.03            Practically  all  contracts suffered delays  in
implementation for various reasons, most important of these
were:
a)   Problems  caused  by  inavailability  of  equipment   and
certain materials and lack of working capital wLth many
contractors;
b)   Delay  by Government in acquisition of  right-of-way  and
relocation of utilities:



- 53 -
c)   Poor job organization and lack of managerial skill  among
most Contractors;
d)   Complex  and  time consuming  Government  procedures  for
processing interim payments. certificates and construction
change orders.
e)   Considerable escalation in prices of construction inputs,
spare parts and equipments:
f)    Additional   work   orders  found   necessary   due   to
unanticipated need for additional construction works such as
culverts. riprap for side slope protection. dining of ditches,
etc.
3.0            It was envisaged at the time of appraisal  that
the project will be completed in all respects by December 1983
together with closing of the accounts.   Unfortunately,   these
exoectations  were  not fully realized.   Targets of  all  key
activities suffered partly because of unforeseen circumtances
and partly due to additional discussions made necessary with
the World Bank.
3.05            During  the  preparatory   phase,  the  project
suffered delays because of varLous reasons such as the desire
of the Bank to revise economic analysis for a number of
projects to check on their high cost estimates, the difficulty
in hiring of consultants for detailed engineering because of
their high bids which necessitated renegotiation with them
including revision of the terms of reference which had to get
approval from the bank, the delay in detailed engineering
phase   due to high rates quoted by the local consultants that
made the bank to suggest renegotiation of the bids and the
delay   in   equipment   procurement  due   to   problems   of
specifications as weli as pre-qualification of bidders which
could be resolved only in consultations with the Bank.
3.06            Likewise, during the implementation stage there
were valid reasons for delays, in some cases, the restraining
peace and order problems in some parts of Abra and Kalinga-
Apayao that caused the contractors to abandon or delay the
construction  of the proJect.   The inappropriate  design  for
some projects which were ascertained during implementation
have also been a stumbling block, since these necessitated
additional  investigations.   The considerable  escalation  in
prices of construction inputs particularly cement, steel,
fuel,  lubricating  oil  and spare parts for equipment is  the
*main reason for the issuance of change orders that also caused
the delay, but the PMO has exerted considerable restraint
about these change orders that they investigated such cases
through especially deputed teams from the PRIP Central Office.
Another reason is the additional work orders found necessary
in the case of roads which were completely new construction
and   a   large   number   of   them   are   located    across
rolling/mountaious terrain that require additional work which



- 54 -
were but inevitable du- to unanticipated occurrence of rock.
need   for  additional   culverts,   riprap  for  side   slope
protection  dining  of  ditches.   etc.    In  the  course  of
construction of the project. there were also repeat orders for
some proJects which were either washed out or eroded due to
frequent typhoon occurrence.
3.07            However, in a l-rze number of cases, there were
also some reasons which the contractors were themselves to be
blamed for the delay or non-completion of the projects due to
their  incompetence.   Frequent meetings were being held  with
these contractors to urge them to work fast, at the same time
most of the poorly performing contractors have been issued
warning letters at the Deputy Minister's level about possible
recission of their contract.
3.08            Among the total road projects  under  contract.
28 proJects or U2% were completed on time while the rest were
delayed from less than a year to a maximum of three (3) years.
About 10% of the contract proJects were either cancelled or
rescinded  and  were completed  by  administration.   However.
almost all (52 road proJects) of the road proJects implemented
by administration were all completed on time.
Communal Trr!iastJon
3.09            The design and construction of this project was
undertaken by the National Irrigation Administration (NTA).
The construction of the L3 communal sub-projects started last
July 1978 and was completed almost as scheduled in December
1983.   Most  of these sub-projects were constructed by  labor
intensive  method  with  active  involvement  of  the   farmer
beneficiaries in the formulation. design and construction of
the systems as well as in their operation and maintenance.
The constructed systems have already been turned-over to their
respective   Irrigators'  Service  Associations  (ISAs)   when
typhoon   and   strong  floods  cccured  in  1984   and   1985
necessitating repair and restoration works in some portion of
the   projects.    The  repair  and  restoration   works  were
completed in May 1986.
3.10             The  implementation of this  project  was,  in
seneral, satisfactorily completed as the costs and schedule of
completion have generally remained almost within the appraisal
estimates except for some minor slippages brought about by
errors in desizn and construction of canals at Calaccad and
Bagombong and of ogees at Tumalunog and Hamtic; the problems
on right-of-way due to objections of some farmers to the
construction   of   on-farm  facilities  and   the   lack   of
responsiveness and awareness of their responsibilities among
the ISA members.

3.11             The  Bureau   of Public Works  of  DPWTC  was
responsible  for the design.  construction and supervision of
Barangay Health Stations while the Project Management Staff
of DOH was responsible for its contract administration
procurement of supplies and materials and operation.
3.12             The construction of the programmed 60  health
stations started in 1979 and made operational in  1983.   The
construction of the buildings were completed and were brought
to a uniform standard finish as required although the
equipping and furn±shing of these stations were completed
only in 1985.
3.13              The   implementation  of  this  proJect   is
generally satisfactory except for some minor delays caused by
problems on the systems used for budgeting of project funds
which resulted to lengthy delays in construction while
disbursements from the IDA credit are awaited.
3.14            The  Bureau  of  Public  Works  of  DPWTC   was
responsible  for the design and construction  of  ports.   The
construction and development of the ports of San Jose and
Culasi  were already completed although there  were  slippages
mainly  due  to  inability of contractors to finish  the  work
because  of  increases in construction  costs.   The  port  of
Dumaguit has not yet been  completed  at  the  time  of   this
reevaluation.
3.15            The port of Culasi in Capiz was almost (87.82s)
completed  in  1982 when the contract was  terminated  due  to
inability  of the contractor to finish the work.   The rest of
the  work was done by another contractor and was completed  in
1983.
3.16            The port of San Jose de Buenavista was  already
99.17% complete when the newly constructed breakwater was
damaged by a typhoon in late March 1982 and the contract was
terminated in 1983.   The completion of the work which was the
construction of concrete wharf extension was done by another
contractor  and  was completed in 1983.   The  repair  of  the
damaged breakwater was done by another contractor and was
completed last April 1986.
3.17            The construction/improvement of Dumaguit  port
has not been-completed due to the deficiency in the attainment
of   the  desired  soil  bearing  capacity  of  the   original
reinforced concrete test piles for the wharf.   Instead of the
designed length of 23 to 27 meters, piles now up to 0O meters
have  to  be  precasted.   Along  this  line,  the  contractor



- 56 -
requested for th- adjustment of unit prices which necessitated
for change orders and extra work orders due to changes in
quantity on several work items.
Au=l Watar SUDO1lV
3.18            The  Bureau of Public Works of DPWTC was  also
responsible for the construction and drilling of  wells.   The
drilling  of wells was started on time.   A total of 462 wells
were actually drilled but only 437 of which were completed and
serviceable since 1982. the other 25 wells were abandoned
during the process of implementation due to unfavorable
condition such as salty water, shale formation and muddy
water.   Noting  the  availability of more funds due to  lower
than anticipated unit costs, additional 40 wells were drilled
and made operational in 1984 bringing the total physical
accomplishments to 477 wells already completed although some
or about 3% are currently not operational because of poor
maintenance, since they were not included in the organized
Water Users Association.
3.19              In  general,    the  implementation  of   this
component  has been smoothly undertaken except for some  minor
slippage  due  to difficulties and delays  in  procurement  of
equipment and materials.
C.  Pro1ect Chanbes
nArannAv Roads Conent
3.20            During the appraisal a total of 1,390  kms.  of
baranzay roads was proposed for construction/improvement, this
included 820 kms. of new barangay roads, 240 kms. of existing
roads, 290 kma. of access roads to serve the communal
irrigation proJect and 40 kms. access road3 to the barangay
health stations. (the list of proposed roads as appraised are
shown in Annex 3.20.1). Among these proposed roads only about
46% or 639 kms. were implemented; 131 kms. of which composed
of   existing  roads,  398 kms.  new,  89 kms.  as  access  to
communal irrigation systems and 21 kms.  as access to baransay
health stations.  The remaining of the total ; 012.095 kms. of
roads actually completed were new lists of roads included as
replacements to the original proposed roads because of their
low   expected  economic  returns  based  on  evaluation   and
relatively high construction costs involved based on the
detailed design conducted, rather they were replaced by roads
which were technically and economically feasible. (see Maps I-
III).
3.21            There  were also minor changes in the design of
some road projects especially in the case of roads which were
completely  new  construction because the  alignments  pas. .ni
rolling   and   mountainous  terrains  were   not   accurately
anticipated and that it requir-d additional work such as



- 57 -
additional culverts. riprap for slope protection and side
ditches.
TrriZat _'on Thomconenl
3.22           The Appraisal Peport envisioned the c^struction
of about 53 new communal irrigation projects serving about
8.500 hectares. and rehabilitation-/improvement of 2 existinZ
systems serving 900  hectares  or a  total  of 9.400 hectares.
With  the  completion  of  the  project,   only  L3   communal
irrigation facilities were implemented of which 22 are new
irrigation systems serving about 5.274 hectares and 21 are
existing systems which were rehabilitated/improved covering
4.315  hectares.    Despite  the  reduction in  the  number  of
projects  implemented. the  actual phys4 cal area provided with
irriZation facilities increased from the appraisal estimates
of 9.5'00 hectares to 9,589 hectares.   Likewise.  the  average
cropping intensity increased from an estimated 164% to 17UN
and correspondinaly increasing the total effective ares (annual
i.rrigable area) from 15.400 hectares to 16,705 hectares. (see
Annex 3.22.1).
3.23            Moreover,  out of the 43 implemented  projects,
23 were included in the appraisal listings and 15 systems were
new  4nclusions.  Reasons for these project changes appear  to
be: inviability of the proposed system wherein the internal
rate of return set at 10%' could not be attained: minimal
source of water; steep slope; and high construction ccst
particularly  on  the impoundlng type of diversion  which  the
beneficiaries have been reluctant due to its high amortization
payment.   These  factors resulted in the replacemer.t./deletion
of some originally appraised projects.

3.24           Five(5)  ports were  initially   considered  for
improvement under this component of the r.roject they are
Culasi Port in Capiz. San Jose de Buenavista Port in Antique,
Dumazuit Port in Aklan and Tubigon and Talibon Port in Bohol.
Of all this, only three(3) ports were actually implemented
because the rehabilitation of Tutigon and Talibon Port proved
to be not economically viable.
3.25            The  port   of  Culasi  in  Capiz   was  87.80'
completed   last  March  1982  when  the  contract  with   JBS
Construction  Incorporated was terminated.   The rest  of  the
work  was done by contract with Footsteps  Construction.   T',e
repair of the concrete stairway. construction of cargo shed,
deflector wave and deleted parts of the original contract were
completed   in  1933  following  almost  all  the   level   of
improvement proposed during appraisal.
3.26            The  San Jose  de Buenavista  port  was  99.17
complete when the newly constructed breakwater was damnaged by
a typhoon in late March 1982.   Additional work was undertaken



- 58 -
in extension of the reinforced concrete wharf which was
completed in 1983. The repair and construction of the damaged
breakwater was completed in April 1986.
3.27            The  improvement of DumaZuit Port has not  been
completed  for reasons as explained in  paragraph  3.'7.   The
construction of this port is still on-going with funding from
national budget allocation.
Raia-nuav Health Stat1ona
3.23           Programmed for construction under this component
were 60 units: seven in Abra, sixteen in Kalinga-Apayao, eight
in Aklan. ten in Antique, ten in Capiz and nine in Bohol. All
the 60 units were completed and made operational in 1983.
except  that  some  units under the proposed  siltes  were  not
implemented rather they were replaced by units under new
sites.   This  was because some of the proposed units required
costly access roads, others have relatively low population
served and still cthers failed to meet the proJect criteria as
to its necessity and accessibility because of the availability
of health centers which are more accessible from the arua.
Thus, new units were implemented under new sites which are
more accessible and could serve a considerable number of
population.
3.29             The list of completed Barangay Health Stations
(BHS) in the above mentioned 6 provinces is shown in Map III.
Rural Water SunolV
3.30             This   component  originally  had  300   wells
proposed to be drilled and constructed in the depressed areas
of  the  said  6  provinces.    Because  the  actual  cost  of
construction  was  much  less  than  the  estimated  cost   of
construction, the physical target was raised to 418 weljs with
World  Bank concurrence.   Thus,  more wells were drilled  and
constructed to meet the water supply requirements of rural
people  within the proJect areas.   A total of 477 wells  were
drilled and completed excluding those which were abandoned as
explained in paragraph 3.18.
D. Cantra to  Peraormanca
3.31             Implementation of contract Packages I  and  1I
started mostly in the first part of 1981 against oriZinal
target of March 1979 due to some setbacks encountered during
the Preparatory phase of the project (see paragraph 3.5).
The contractors performance are generally satisfactory except
for some which exhibited poor performance because of lack of
working   capital  and  equipment  and  inadequate   technical
capabilities.   To date a total of 57 contract proJects with a
total length of 527.985 kms. have already been completed, 22
contract road projects still remained uncompleted because
their  contracts  were either terminated or  rescinded.   This



- 59 -
happenod b-cause most c. these contract projects are located
in  very  critical  rebel-infested  areas  which  fcrced   the
contractors to abandon the project, while some were not
completed because of inability of contractors.
3.32             Most  cf  tha  uncompleted  works  of  sever;a
terminated and rescinded contract packages were completed by
administration  while  some were proposed to be given  to  the
Engineering Brigade of the AFP for completion but the Bank
objected.   To utilize available funds of projects affected by
the very critical peace and order problems in the proJect
areas realignment of funds to new projects after consultation
with and approval by the Bank and the Central Office had been
resorted to.
3.33             Overall,  the  implementation of  roads  under
contracts  have  been  satisfactorily completed  and  on  time
except for some which were affected by adverse weather
condition and the cash flow problems of some contractors. due
in part to the rapid inflation of construction costs and in
part to the fact that their bids were relatively low.

3.311            The  design  of the project  was  carried  out
separately    by   component.        The   National    Irrigation
Administration (NIA) was responsible far the design and
construction of communal irrigation projects, the Bureau of
Public Works (BPW) of then DPWTC, was responsible for the
design and construction of ports and drilling of wells for the
rural water supply proJect, the Department of Health (DOM) was
responsible for the construction of Barangay Health Stations
under the supervision of BPW. For the detailad engineering of
barangav roads, this was carried out by local consultants who
had worked in close cooperation with the Bureau of Barangay
Roads (BBR) established within the Department of Public
Highways (DPH).   The BBR supervised the detailed  engineering
through the issuance of guidelines, established standards for
designs and plan preparation and make periodic reviews of all
works undertaken.
3.35             Regardless  of the assistance  and  guidelines
provided by the DPH Project Office, the consultants had been
solely responsible for all the data received and gathered for
all designs conclusions and recommendations made by them.
3.36             The  activities  of  the  design   consultants
include  field  surveys,   bridge  site  surveys,   soils  and
materials inveRt1gations, pavement evaluarion and design,
preparation  of  complete constructior, plans,  estimation  of
quantities.  detailed unit price analysis,  cost estimates and
assistance   in   the  preparation  of  documents  for   local
competitive bidding.



- 60 -
3.37             The detailed engineering phase of the  proJect
was delayed by one and a half month because the Bank suggested
a  renegotiation of consultancy bids due to high rates  quoted
by  local consulting firms.   The target date of completion of
detailed engineering design was January 1979 but the actual
completion was mid of 1981.
3.38             In  general,  the  performance of  the  design
consultants were satisfactory and they acted favorably to the
DPH/3ank  decision  to  make them solely responsible  for  the
work.   However,  it  has been noted that had the  consultants
given greater attention to some of the routine design problems
during detailed engineering design, a portion of the cost
overrun could have been avoided (see paragraph 3.06).
3.39             There  is no doubt that the  local  consultina
firms gained valuable design experience and training by
undertaking  such  responsible  roles  but  there  is   little
evidence   that  most  of  these  firms  realized  significant
improvements in work organization ability through development
of  their own middle management staff.   This matter has  been
discussed with DPH and the consultants and improvement of this
difficiency will be given particular attention in future work.
Technei Al Assitance
3.Uo             The technicel assistance by consultants  began
in  February 1981.   The MPH.  cognizant of the requirement of
the International Development Association (IDA) have availed
the services of the consultants from International Labour
Organization (ILO) advisory services to assist the BBR in the
implementation of rural roads planning, design construction
and maintenance of the road component under the  PRIP-I.   For
this purpose, two consultants from ILO was appointed as Rural
Roads Engineer and Labour-based Engineer. The services of the
Rural Roads Engineer covered 24 man-months whose duty was
mainly to assist the Director of BBR in the analysis and
evaluation of detailed engineering activities and prepare
documents and reports pertaining to individual project where
contractors  are engaged.   The Labour-based  Engineer,  whose
services covered only 4 man-months, was assigned to prepare
plan of action for the implementation of rural roads using
labor-intensive methods, and assist and train contractors for
efficient   use of labor in order to develop the institutional
capacity within the BBR to carry out major part of future
program for rural roads with labor-based methods.
3.lI               The   consultants   completed   their   work
satisfactorily.   The Labour-based Engineer ended his services
in  June  1981,  the  services of  the  Rural  Roads  Engineer
terminated originally in July 1983 and was extended by one
year to July 1984.   Both consultants have contributed greatly
to the efficient Implementation of the rural roads.

IV. PROJRCT COS? AND    1uJS!MENT
A.   P  etcoskts
4.0l             A comparison between appraisal cost  estimates
and  final  costs by component is shown in  Annex  a .Oll.  As
shown in Annex 4L.0' : the final proJect cost. excluding the
feasibility studies and right-of-way is USS 48.3 million, some
USS 11 million or 18 lower than the appraisal cost estimates
of USS 59.0 million,  Including contingencies.   Likewise, the
foreign exchange and local component (in US dollar equivalent)
costs have also decreased by 23% and 13%.  from the  appraisal
estimate of USS 28.0 and 31.0 million to actual cost of USS
21.5 and 26.8 million,  respectively.   On the other hand, the
project   cost   in  local  currency   equivalent   showed   a
considerably  higher final cost than the appraisal estimate by
about  42%  from  P 436.6 million appraisal cost to  p   t136.6
million final cost.   The foreign exchange component in local
currency have also increased by 33X from the appraisal
estimate of P 207.3 million to P 275.4 million while the local
component increased by a bigger percentage of 50% P 229.L
million in the appraisal to P 343.1 final cost.
e.02            The decrease in foreign currency (USS) value of
the project cost Inspite of its increase in local currency
value (P) colld be explained as the effect of various factors.
The increase in local currency value of the proJect cost was
attributed mainly to the longer implementation period dua to
several reasons (as stated in paragraph 3.03); increase in
local   prices   of   construction    materials;        additional
constructlon works and rehabilitation works for projects
destroyed by typhoon; and delay in procurement of imported
equipments.   However,  the  decrease in dollar value  of  the
project cost was due to a number of reasons such as the
increase   in   foreign  exchange  rate;   the   decrease   in
construction cost for irrigation components because, out of
the 51 irrigation projects for construction as identified in
the appraisal, only 32 proJects were constructed and the rest
are Just rehabilitated; inability of the contractors to
complete the port improvement projects; and unavailment of the
remaining balance of the loan proceeds (only USS 21.5 million
was availed as against USS 28.0 million) because of the
untimely expiry of the loan.
4 03              The  foreign  exchange  and  local   currency
components of the project cost overrun were financed  entirely
by the Government from its own resources.
B.   DiRhuwsmentS
a .04            Disbursements  lagged  well  behind  appraisal
estimates throughout the project implementation period as
shown in table below. This was the result of the very slow
st3rtups on most construction contracts and the much slower
rate of implementation than had been assumed at appraisal



- 62 -
(para.  3.05-3.07).   Because of these,  the closing date  was
extended three times; first by 12 months from the original
December 31, 1983 to December 31. 193g. The difficulties and
unforeseen  events  continued  to  cause  the  slow  pace   in
construction activities that resulted to the reextension of
the loan to December 31. 1935 and subsequently to JuJne 30.
1936 to permit further availment of the balance of the loan
proceeds, but still the loan funds were not fullY di3bursed.
4 05             The disbursement rate for  Category  I,  civll
works, was increased to 45% effective December 13. 1983 in
order to utilize subcategory 1 (a) for contractor mobilization
which has not been disbursed at the time. The schedule of
accumul.ated disbursements is shown in Annex a.05.1.
4.o6             "he allocation of loan proceeds as arnticipated
in the appraisal was actually followed and changes from

5.01             In July 1979,  the DPWTC was divided into the
Department of Transportation and Communication (DOTC) and the
remainin& functions to the Department of Public Works (D'W).
The   DPW  and  DPH  and  other  national  line   departments
automatically became Ministries following the adoption of the
parliamentary system of goverment.   Taking the cognizance of
the importance of infrastructure as a solid foundation for
national grow-h, these two huge ministries (MPW and MPH) were
merged on goverment reorganization in July 1981 into Ministry
of 2ublic Wo.rks and Hizt,ways (MP'H), for simplicity and
economy   in  operation.      The  MPWH  and  other  government
Ministries are now reverted back to Departments following
the political svstem of the new-/current administration.
Communal Tr-ization Comoonnnt
5.02             N.A in coordination with the the FSDC was the
executing agency of the irrigation component. A ProJect
Manager based in Manila was directly responsible for the
execution of the project under the overall supervision of the
Assistant Administrator for the Engineering and Operations
which  is  likewise responsible to the administrator for  the
regional  NIA  offices  which  are  headed  by  the  regional
directors who are responsible for all NIA activities in the
project   provinces   constituting  their   regions   through
provincial irrization engineers. On the other hand, the FSDC
under a memorandum of agreement with NIA, is responsible in
organizing the farmers into Irrigation Services Associations
(ISAs). recruitment and training of Institutional Offices to
be assiZned to each ISA. and the operation and maintenance
supervision.
5.03            On the early stage of proJect  implementation,
the progress of the construction and the design of future
projects   vary  from  one  provinces  to  the  other.    and
generally, was less than what was expected due to management
aspects which requires particular attention. Much works were
assigned to the provincial irrigation engineers over and
above their former responsibilities with inadequate support
from the Regional Offices especially on the detatl design
phase and construction supervision. Moreover, the FSDC which
is responsible for the institutional development aspects of
tne component was, in some cases, not able to established
effectively and sufficiently the management and operational
requirements inputs which resulted in disparities of the
proJect execution.



- 64 -
5.04               However,     the   agency   organized    its
administrative and executive structure in September 1930, to
adequately   cope   with  the  works  and   m-et   increasing
responsibilities, particularly in externally funded projects.
A major innovation in the modified set-up was the creation of
four (4) offices for Assistant Administrators who assist the
Administrator in major functional areas. These are (i)
Project Development and Implementation (ii) Operations (ii')
Finance and Management; and (iv) Administrative Services. The
Office for Project Development and Implementation was created
to formulate, implement, direct and supervise all foreign -
assisted projects including this one, which were previously
under the functions and responsibilities of the Office of
Speclal ProJects. The functions of FSDC under the reorganized
set-up was taken over under the Assistant Administrator for
Systems Operation.
Rar-n-mf navds CimoDnent
5.05             The  BBR  within the then  DPH  was  directly
responsible for the proJect execution which was headed by a
Project Manazer (BBR Asst. Director) based in Manila under
the overall supervision of the lirector of BBR. who reports
to the DPH Assistant Secretary for Operations. The proJect
Manager coordlnates the work of the various divisions of BBR
and of the consultants (local and foreign) under the project.
PRIP field activities were administered through four regional
offices under the dir ction of a regional director and in
turn has eight districtoffices (Abra in reglon I. Kalinga and
Apayao in Region II, Aklan, Antique and Capiz in Region VI
and Bohol I and I: in Region VII) which are all headed by
highway district engineers. The Barangay Roads Division at
each regional offices represents BBR at the regional level and
the Barangay Roads sections of each distric carries out the
construction, improvement and maintenance of barangay roads.
Under the proJect, a separate PRIP project offices were
established at the district levels under the direction of a
Project Engineers who were responsible for the projects field
activities  which  includes  detailed  designs,   construction
of projects undertaken by administration and construction
supervision of contract projects.
5.06             In the goverment reorganization of  July  1931
which merged the MPW and MPH into one Ministry (the MPWH and
later  the  DPWH).   the  BBR  was  abolished  and  a  Project
Management  Office  (PMO)  for  PRIP-I  was  created  at   the
headquarters to coordinate with the ProJect Engineers through
the regional directors concerned in the project execution and
other related activities that has been established/started by
the SBR.



- 65 -
5.07              The   Institutional  performance   of   this
component was in some cases, disappointing despite the
efforts  being made to improve the implementation on  a  more
systematic and vigorous procedure. An anticipation in the
proJect   appraisal  to  strengthen  various  project  related
offices in the n-tional, regional and provincial level proved
futLle and is relatively attributable to the capacity of the
implementing office (BBR) which was then new organization and
have not previously undertaken large program, and emphasizing
particularly the wide scope of the component which requires
careful coordination, planning and management. Consequently.
the reorganizations that occured during the process has
greatly affected the institutional improvements and in zome
cases,   some   factors  which  were  beyond  control  of  the
management   such   as   the  peace   and   order   situation.
Nevertheless, the proJect has served as a good basis and
considered to be relevant in any future undertakings specially
on a multi-sectoral program.
Baranxav Health StAtions
5.08             At  the  early  stages  of  the  project,  an
arrangement  has  been made,  with concurrence from the  bank,
whereby the BPW's Building Division will be responsible in
the   project   execution  of  this  component   instead   of
construction supervision only as agreed upon during the
proJect appraisal. In the process, there was a satisfactory
performance in the project's physical accomplishments,however.
the coordination, monitoring and provisions of other services
for the health stations including water supply, lighting.
essential furnishings such as examination tables and storage
facilities and in some cases, medical equipment and supplies,
as provided for under the project were inadequate due to
financial constraints. An action program were taken into
consideration to complement these defficiencies to ensure an
effective operation.
Rural  Water  ru% Iv
5.09             The  Wells and Springs Unit  of  BPW's  Water
Resources Division within the DPWTC was then responsible for
the implementation of this component and following the
department reorganization it was transfered to MPW Water
Supply Section and later to the Water Supply Division under
the Bureau of Construction in coordination with the PMO-Rural
Water supply under the reorganized set up. (Merging of MPW
and  MPH  into  MPWH  and  later  DPWH. )  The   institutional
performance was satisfactory which leads further to a fairly
substantial increase in the scope of the water supply
component of the project.

Ports ComDonpnt
5. 10             Th- BPW's Ports and Harbors  Division  within
the  then DPWTC, in coordination with PPA were responsible for
the execution of this component.  Inspite of the  satisfactory
performance relative to the coordination of these agencies.
the project experienced some implementation delays which are
attributable to contractor's performance, additional works
such as repairs of typhoon damates and major change orders in
civil works which require substantial additional costs. An
action program to complete the remaining works were taken into
consideration through realignment of funds and/or inclusion in
the annual appropriations.
VI. ECONOMIC RE-EVALUATION
A.  Barana, Roads
6.01             The  road  projects are specifically aimed  to
provide an all-weather access linking relatively isolated
villages to the mainstream of economic life of the provinces
and to realize full benefits thereby increasing agricultural
income  and  uplift the standard of living in the  area.   The
areas served are major producers of palay, corn, coconut and
some  rootcrops  and  banana.   Thirteen  read  protects  were
selected  for  analysis  and  each  road  was  considered   to
represent  a  typical  barangae' in each  provinces.   However,
evaluation of roads in Kalinga Apayao and Abra were not
undertaken d' e to limited time and critical peace and order
situation in both provinces.
6.02              The   inhabitants  'n  the   influence   area
benefitted substantially from lower transport costs, reduced
travelling time and increased agricultural production. In the
Appraisal Report, "Producer Surpls" approach has been used in
the economic evaluation, thus, only the development benefits
were  calculated.    Development  benefits  were  expected  to
accelerate as a result of increased in cultivated area, crop
intensification,    improved  agricultural  practices   thereby-
increasing  yield   levels  of  crops.    All  identified  new
potential  area for future production have been assumed to  be
fully cultivated and yield levels are maximized five years
after completion of the road.
6.03             In  the  post-economic  evaluation,  the  same
methodology  have been applied.   However,  the rate at  which
higher levels of production can be achieved was assumed to
follow a relatively long and flat profile, thereby, benefits
were expected to grow over the whole of the assessment period.
During the interview with the farmers it was observed that
most small farmers are subJect to financial constraints
limiting their capacity to invest in agricultural inputs  thus
extends   their  response  over  e. period  of  years.    Crop
intensification programs and modern technology do not yet

appear to have been easily and widoly accepted and will take
some years to change the traditional method extensively used
spocially in the remote areas.
6.04             In the reassessment of the economic  viability
of   the  road  proJects.   price  increases  for  inputs   in
calculating the costs of production of crops and farmgate
prices were considered and updated to 1986 level. The assumed
farmgate prices are shown below while cost of production
models for each crop are exhibited in Annexes 6.04.1 - 6.04.6.
Project costs (economic cost) were also escalated to 1936
level and opportunity cost of capital was assumed at 15%
compared to 10% used in the appraisal. Yield levels developed
somewhat differently from what is expected in some of the
roads but not  significant  enough to affect the projects.   A
comparison between appraisal and post-economic evaluation
yield levels and maximum yields per crop are shown in Annexes
6.04.7 and 6.04.8

6.06            The   appraisal   report   presented   ten(lO)
representative commununal irrigation systems (CIS) accounting
about 2.400 hectars or 25% of the total proposed  systems, as
test projects that were subjected to detailed feasibility
study .1/ however, with the completion of the projects,two
studied   systems   were  not  implemented  or  were   rather
replaced/relocated.
6.07            During the project implementation, there  were
some changes in service area, cropping intensities, project
costs.yields and the project implementation period, as a
result of which economic re-evaluation of the proJect has
become necessary in order to ascertain project viability at
the end of its completion. For purposes of comparison, the
economic re-evaluation has been limited to the studied
sysytem/CIS and likewise, the justification procedure carried
out in the analysis has been established on the basis of the
assumptions in the 'easibility study report and available
informations    from   the   present   operations   of    the
respective systems.
6.08             Project benefits considered in  the  analysis
were quantified by   deducting  the  net value of productions
from with and without the proJect cases, respectively, and
were derived based on past and present yields and its
corresponding cost of production and yearly market prices.
6.09             The  project  cost used in the  analysis were
escalated  to  1986  level and were  converted  into  economic
values for purposes of evaluation.i.e, the financial cost
reduced by 15%. which was the assumed share of taxes and
custom duties. Ttie estimated operation and maintenance cost
per  hectare  is shown in Annex  6.09.1.   The costs  and  the
benefits stream of the representative systems are presented
in Annex 6.09.2 - 6.09.9 including the economic feasibility
parameters.

6.10              On   the   basis   of   various   significant
factors/changes    that    occured    during    the    project
implementation,  the Intern-l Rate of Return (IRR in %) of the
studied SYStems appear higher from the feasibility study
estimates.  The  higher  IRR is  attributable  to:  a)  larger
service   area   b)  higher  Yields  and  increased   cropping
intensities c) higher farmgateDprice; and d) in some cases
reduction in project costs (see paragraph L.02). The IRR based
on   the  study  estimates  and  as  re-evaluated    for   the
repr-sentative systems are summarized below:

C. RArAngAv Health Stations
6.11             Under  this  component  of  the  project,  the
proposed construction of 60 units of Barangay Health Stations
were all implemented.   except that some of the proposed sites
have been changed due to considerable reasons (see paragraph



- 70 -
3.28).   The  proJects'  major  alm  is  to  provide  physical
facilities and medical supplies to deliver first level or
emergency health care. family planning services and nutrition
advice  to families in the rural areas.   The maJority of  the
families in the proJect areas cannot pay for such services or
cannot be treated immediately because they have to travel
considerable distances to the nearest town to obtain them.
The project also Include medical swpplies. or waiting porch,
infants' examination room, storage room, toilet facilities and
a water supply system and being manned by a midwife trained by
DOH in providing health and family planning services and
nutrition advice.   The summary of accomplishments of Barangay
Health Stations by province indicating number of patients
cerved,  health delivery services,  referrals to hospitals and
primary health care is sho,.n in Annex 6.11.1.
6.12             During  appraisal no detailed  evaluation  has
been  undertaken for this component of the project.   For  the
purpose of this reevaluation, "before and after" analysis has
been applied wherein the health condition in the project areas
before and after the completion of the project was analyzed.
Based on the Department of Health records total crude deaths
in the proJect areas as of 1985 was 12,893, which was 18.6 per
cent lower than 15,839 before the opening of the project in
1979.   Likewise,  total  infant mortality also declined  from
3,373 in 1979 to 1.897 in 1985, a L3.8 per cent decrease.
This only denotes that the project had contriButed greatly  in
the improvement of health and living condition in the project
areas.   Provincial data also exhibited significant decline in
the number of crude deaths and infant mortalities from 1979 to
1985 as shown below:

6.13            The major causes of deaths attributable to  the
inavailability of rural health and medical facilities are
inJuries, pulmonary diseases. diarhea. heart diseases and
maternal   deaths   due  to  birth   deliveries.    The   main
beneficiaries of the component are the poorer families of the
rural population in the project area estimated at 132.503 at a
cost of about USS l.1l per family.
D. 2oW.ts
6.14             The  improvement of Culasi port in  Capiz  was
completed in 1983 and have been fully-operatlonal since then,
while the port of San Jose de Buenavista in Antique was
already 99% completed when it was damaged by typhoon in 1932
and  repair  and  works were completed in  April  1986.   The
Dumaguit port in Aklan still remains unfinished because of its
existing defficiency in the attainment of desired soil bearing
capacity, thus. additional works have been proposed which
involves   relatively  hizher  cost  of   construction.    The
temporary  wharf at Washington municipality near  Dumaguit  is
currently  being utilized instead as the port facility in  the
area.
6.15             Though   relatively small in size compared  to
national ports, these ports are of major importance to the
poor rural population whose inter-regional connection is based
on  them.   As of 1985,  the port of Culasi had a total of 211
shipcalls. the port of San Jose de Buenavista has 134
shipcalls and the port of Washington (temporary port of
Dumaguit) has 320 shipcalls. As of the same year, the port of
Culasi  had  a  total  of about 123,000 metric tons  of  carzo
handled, while San Jose de Buenavista had 28,000 metric tons
and Washington had 63.000 metrie tons.
6.16             In the reevaluation of the port  proJect,  the
evaluation  methodology  previously used in the  appraisal  is
adopted in order to come up with post-economic evaluation
return.   The  methodology  assumed that  without  improvement
these ports handle traffic witth difficulty and will not be
able to handle increases in traffic unless facilities are
rehabilitated, further dilapidation of these ports would mean
hardship and extra expense ?or pecple and cargoes transporting
betwetn  the islands.   It is assumed that existinx volume  of
cargo would have to be shipped to and from -other islands
through Iloilo port, incurring additional transportation cost
by road for 100 km from Antique to Iloilo (for San Jose). 130
km from Capiz to Iloilo (for Culasi), and 200 km from Akian to
Iloilo  (for Dumaguit).   Despite its uncompleted status,  the
port of Dumaguit is still evaluated based on the assumption



- 72 -
th-t the existing cargo and Passenger traffic in Washington
will be transfered to Dumaguit port by the time it opens and
that the investment cost is tent-tiv-ly based on the latest
construction cost estimate.   The transportation costs by road
to Iloilo was estimated based on the average truck hauling
rate  of  F 2.20 per ton-km.   Future volumi of  cargo  to  be
handled by port was estimated based on the NEDA projection of
increase in trading activities of 7X in Region VI based on
their  Five Year Regional Development  Plan  (1987-1992).   In
this analysis, project life was extended from 15 years In the
appraisal  to 20 years because of the lengthy   implementation
which started in 1979 and actually end in 1986-87 so that the
improved status of these ports is considered to start only in
1986-87 and that full benefits will accrue during this period.
6.17            The investment cost was escalated to 1986 price
level and converted to economic cost net of taxes and duties.
The   total  estimated  operations  and  maintenance  in   the
appraisal was also adjusted to 1986 price level and decreased
by 10% based on the report that the proposed construction of
storage   facilities   was  not  actually   undertaken.    The
opportunity cost of capital is assumed at 15%.
6.18             The  result  of the reevaluation as  shown  in
Annex 6.18.1. indicate that the improvement of all the three
ports  were economically feasible with  economic returns (IRR)
ranging  from 18.03%  to 34.7%.   The  Culasi   port   yielded
the hignest return of 34.7%. next is the Port of Dumaguit with
an  IRR  of  23.A%.   The  lowest IRR  goes  to  San  Jose  de
Buenavista port with only 13.0%.  As compared to the appraisal
evaluation,   the  result  of  reevaluation  showed  a  slight
difference wherein post- valuation report showed a relatively
higher IRR as indicated below:
Tnternal Rate of Reaturn (%)

E. Ru ,Al Water SUDo1lv
6.19             The project provided the rural areas with  300
village wells which are envisaged to improve considerably the
availability  and  quality of water for  the  villaZers.   The
benefits  from  a safe and reliable water supply  would  arise
primarily  from  a reduction in water-borne diseases  and  the
elimination of a considerable amount of unproductive time and
effort  devoted to hauling water over long  distances.   These
benefits have not been Quantified in the appraisal,  and still
in this reevaluation,  due to inavailability of data but these
are judged to justify the small per capita investment of about
USS 38.3 given the estimated total population served of  about
110. CO;.
VII. BANK'S PERFORMANCs
A . PrnA4eet Formulatio and P"Onhwstion
7.01              The  project  formulated  by  the  Bank  was
substantially   in  agreement  1ith the Government's efforts  to
uplift the Socio-econcmic conditions in the rural areas
through the integrated area development approach. The proJect
was formulated in order to provide relatively small-scale
infrastructure projects such as the construction of Barangay
roads, BaranZay Health stations and Pural Water Supplies and
the improvement of ports, which assure efficient facilities to
promote health and economic well-being of the rural populace
in the six(6) selected provinces of Abra, Kalinga-Apayaot
Bohol. Aklan. Antique and Capiz  thus the principal objecti4es
of the projects were generally met.
B.   ropect Tmolementation
7.02             The  implementation schedule prepared  by  the
Bank's appraisal mission proved to be overly optimistic and
did not allow adequately for Government lengthy administrative
procedures and the delaying effects on construction activities
of some unavoidable factors such as the difficult weather
condition and the peace and other situation. In addition, the
project encountered sad experiences that also led directly to
the delays in the implementation, which would be attributed
in  part  or  wholly  to the  Bank's  relatively           ieXative
attitudes.   Due  to the Bank's non-concurrence of the  quoted



- 74 -
costs of consultancy services for which a reevaluation of the
proposals   was   emphatically   recommended,    the   detailed
engineering of the Barangay roads component was delayed for
almost one and a half years setting back to about two years
the construction schedules or ttme frames of the contract
packages.   The  renegotiation of the costs of services caused
major discrepancies in the detailed engineering of far-flung
mountan'ous *reas which were detected only during actual
implementation, from Which many costly change orders ensued.
Likewise, the aloofness and tactless attitude of some members
of the supervisory missions particularly during the early
stages of implementation has at several instances been the
caus- of disenchantment especi.lly among field officials of
implementing agencies that resulted to lukewarm cooperation
and loss of interest in attending meetings with the Missions.
7.03             On the other side of the matter the World Bank
had  helped  keeping  the  project  in  the  stream.   Through
suggestions, recommendations and follow-ups the problems that
could have aggravated farther the delay were resolved in due
time.   Th   Central Office of PRIP-I takes cognizance of  the
important role played   by  the  Bank  which  involves   among
the following
1.  Assistance   that expedited the supply and eleveries
of heavy and light construction equipment including
service vehicles for the barangav roads, rural water
supply and the communal irrigation components.
2.  Assistance  in  strengthening by way of  suggestions
the coordinative link for effectiveness in project
implementation between the central, regional and
district levels of management.
3.  Assistance  in  the  strengthening   of  staffs   to
facilitate the design of the irrigation facilities
and structures.
4.  Recommended  the employment of sufficient  engineers
to  highway  district  offices  to  work  with   the
selected local consultants for gainful experience.
5.  Timely  concurrence of the approved  tenderdocuments
or   contract   papers  forwarded  related  to   the
constr.zction of barangay roads. barangay health
stations  and  ports  and  the  early  approval   of
requests for works by force account.
6.  The  mission were very supportive in the discussions
of financial matters like CDC's including policies
that have bearings on the Project.
7.  All-out  support for staff civil engineers attendinZ
short  trainings  and  seminars  abroad  that   have
relevance to the Project.



- 75 -
8. Instrumental to the granting of loan extensions that
would have been difficult and doubtful without the
missions advices.
7.04             In its entirety the Bank did much in assisting
the    countryside   development.        The    agreements    and
disenchantment that pervaded during the initial stages of
project implementation and which resulted to extreme civility
especially  on  the  part  of the  implementors    because  of
attitudinal differences of the early missions later on turned
to cordi3l and harmoniuos Partnership in the pursuance of the
ProJect's objectives and coals.
VllI. CONCL"STONS
A.   Qverall Assesment
8.01            The major objectives of the ProJect were met by
providinZ an all-weather  road  access  to  markets,   health
stations and irrigation systems for the rural population:
irrigating a number of farmlands to increase the yield of
rural production; providing rural health stations to promote
health and serve the medical needs of the rural populace and
improving the water system to provide safe and potable
drinking water.
8.02             The implementation of the Project  took  about
four  years  longer than envisaged at the time  of  appraisal,
with  some  leftover  projects still on-going  under  national
fund.   The delays in implementation were due to circumstances
which could not have been foreseen at that time.   The  extent
of delays, however, could have been reduced by a less
dema.iding time schedule particularly for the selection of
consultants   and  the  construction  of  civil   works   (see
paragraphs 3.05 to 3.07).
8.03              Although  the  efforts  made  were  generally
successful,  improvements were needed in  subsequent  projects
related  to  monitoring  and  controlling  cash  advances  and
development   of   procedures  for  prompt  price   escalation
adjustments, thus, it would help if for future projects, basic
project data were computerized and updated regularly, so as to
permit easy access to essential Information regarding the
project.   In addition,  unnecessary   complex  administrative
procedures for processing construction change orders and
interim payments caused financial problems and time delays to
several contractors in the initial phases of construction.
Although procedures were improved during the project period,
earlier attention to potential problems in this area would
have saved much time and trouble.
8.04            Apart from the cost overruns,  and the  delayed
completion of the project, and despite the difficulties



- 76 -
encountered with most of the Contractors, the Project has been
completed in * generallY satisfactory manner.
B.  Fo11ow-uo Att1nn
8.05             It is suggested that the Bank should  continue
to pursue with the Government the detailed investigation and
evaluation  of  the  Future Infrastructure  Component  of  the
Project for the other ten depressed provinces in the country
for possible implementation in the future.
