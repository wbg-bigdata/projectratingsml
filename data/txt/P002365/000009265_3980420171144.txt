REPUBLIC OF SENEGAL
URBAN DEVELOPMENT AND DECENTRALIZATION PROGRAM (UDDP)
Credit and Program Summary
Borrower:                  Government of Senegal
Supervisory Ministry:      Ministry of Finance
Implementing Agency:       Municipal Development Agency (MDA) for PACI and PAC2
and AGETIP for PAC3
Credit Amount:             SDR 55.2 million, equivalent to US$75 million
Terms:                     Standard IDA with 40 years maturity.
Co-financing:              The Senegalese Government and the municipalities will finance
an amount estimated at US$19.3 million. The donor community
has expressed interest in parallel financing. The CFD (Caisse
Franqaise de Developpement) has agreed to a parallel financing
of Ffs 50 million.
Program Objectives:        This program supports the Senegalese Decentralization Policy
and aims at gradually shifting responsibility and accountability,
in terms of delivery and maintenance of urban services, and
infrastructure to municipalities. The program's objectives are to:
(a) improve the financial and organizational management of
municipalities; (b) improve the programming of priority urban
investments; (c) rationalize and simplify the financing of urban
investments; and (d) upgrade basic infrastructures in urban and
some rural communities.
Program Description:       The principal components are:
(1) capacity building of central and local governments through
(a) the implementation of a Municipal Adjustment Program
(MAP) based on a municipal contract, a binding agreement
between the MDA and municipalities, and (b) support
activities aimed at providing an enabling environment for
these Municipal Adjustment Programs to take place (training,
fiscal reforms study, etc.); and
(2)physical investments including the construction, rehabilitation
and maintenance of public infrastructure, facilities and
services under the responsibility of local governments,
including: (a) roads, drainage and lighting; (b) education and
health  facilities;  (c)  socio-collective  facilities;  (d)
administrative and technical buildings; (e) revenue generating
facilities (markets, bus stations); (f) environmental sub-
projects (on-site sanitation and solid waste management); and



(h) rehabilitation of historic buildings. A catalogue of
investments was prepared during project preparation which
provides a menu of eligible sub-projects.
Benefits:                       The program  will support the decentralization  process and
promote a more active role for municipalities. It will: (a)
stimulate the capacity of local governments to efficiently
program, finance, execute and maintain facilities, as well as to
deliver the services; (b) facilitate improved municipal financial
performance and contribute to the macroeconomic objectives,
through a reduction of the public sector deficit; (c) positively
impact the urban and rural population through: (i) reduced costs
of and better access to municipal services, and (ii) employment
generation through sustained public works activities.
Risks:                          The major program  risks are: (a) introduction  of parallel
competitive, less demanding sources of funding to municipalities
by other donors; (b) inability of the Government to enact the
required   fiscal   reforms   or   effectively   manage   the
decentralization program; (c) failure of municipalities to
implement the Municipal Adjustment Programs or to reimburse
their share of the credit: and (d) unfavorable macroeconomic
conditions during program execution.
These risks are reduced by: (a) continued coordination with
donors during project preparation and their adherence to the
Program as demonstrated in their willingness to participate in
UDDP; (b) strong ownership demonstrated by the Government
and municipalities through their participation in project
preparation; and (c) a realistic assessment of the municipalities'
financial capacity and a pragmatic Municipal Adjustment
Program catered to specific local circumstances and
performances.
Economic Rate of Return:    When applicable, ranging from 12 to 80 percent.
Estimated Project
Completion:                     The project completion date is December 31, 2002.
This report is based on the findings of an appraisal mission which took place from April 1, 1997 to April 18, 1997 in
Senegal. The appraisal team comprised Messrs/Mmes. C. Farvacque-Vitkovic (Senior Urban Planner and Mission
Leader), E. Mbi (Principal Operations Officer), A. Diawara (Operations Officer), A. Seck (Economist), M. Sidibe
(Research Assistant), L. Godin (Urban Development Specialist), A. Sinet (Municipal Finance Specialist), A. Basti
(Economist), and V. Chomentowski (Municipal Finance Specialist). Messrs/Mmes. R. Maurer, A. Carroll and J. Hicks

Ouayoro, A. Harth, A. Blakely participated in the preparation of the project. Mrs. Letitia Obeng and Mr. Mahmood
Ayub are the Technical Manager and the Country Director, respectively, for this operation.



REPUBLIC OF SENEGAL
URBAN DEVELOPMENT AND DECENTRALIZATION PROGRAM (UDDP)
I. Background
A. Macroeconomic Context
1.01   At the time of independence, August 20, 1960, Senegal had one of the most developed
economies in West Africa. Its economy, dependent on exports of fish, peanuts, and phosphates,
declined with the loss of markets in newly-independent neighboring states, long periods of
drought, weak management, declining terms of trade, and population growth. A 50 percent
devaluation of the African franc in January 1994 has led to substantial increases in local currency
prices for producers that have spurred improved production. A sheltered import-substitution
sector, comprising textiles, shoes and other light manufacturing, remains plagued, however, by
high labor, transportation, and energy costs. Public finances face a decade-long trend in
declining tax revenues, making government increasingly dependent on official development
assistance from bilateral donors.' According to World Bank and IMF estimates, the gross national
product (GNP) of the Republic of Senegal in 1994 was US$4040 million (CFA francs 2,060,300
million). Based on the estimated population, the per capita GNP was US$610 in 1994.2
1.02   Failure to trim  expenditures has led to the accumulation of large debts by the
Government, owed both to public enterprises and to the private sector, causing serious cash-flow
problems for many companies and contributing to severe liquidity shortages in the banking
system. Budgetary deficits place a considerable strain on the economy and relations with
donors.3
1.03   The IMF expressed confidence that the government would continue to achieve the
macroeconomic targets set under the ESAF, a sign to other donors and creditors of an approval of
Senegal's economic plans. Under the economic and financial Policy Framework Paper for the
period of July 1995 to June 1998, the government has agreed to the following economic targets:
(a) keep GDP growth at around the 1995 level of 4.5 percent; (b) increase the investment (in
current prices) from 13.6 percent of GDP in 1994 to 16.9 percent in 1996; (c) achieve primary
surpluses in the Government's budget (reduction of the deficit on a commitment basis, excluding
grants from 5.7 percent of GDP in 1994 to 2.0 percent in 1996); (d) reduce average inflation by
1996 from 3 to 2 percent; and (e) contain the external current account deficit, excluding official
transfers, to 8.0 percent of GDP in 1995, and reduce it to 7.3 percent by 1996.
1.04   The Bank's last Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), discussed by the Board on
February 16, 1995, identified resource mobilization as an important criterion to improve the
macroeconomic situation. Achieving higher growth over the long term will depend on the
Government's ability to implement a strong package of macroeconomic and structural measures
designed to reduce domestic financial imbalances and improve resource allocation. The
stabilization of the fiscal position of the country, the development of the human resources base,

the establishment of a private sector initiative, and a policy to address the rapid population
growth are the key elements of the country strategy. The next CAS is under preparation and is
scheduled for Board consideration in January 1998.
B. Urban Development Trends
1.05    While the economy of Senegal grew at an average annual rate of 2.2 percent from  1982
to 1992, the population also grew at a relatively high rate of 2.6 percent per year.4 The average
urban population growth rate was 3.7 percent 1990 to 1995.5 The population was 3.5 million at
independence in 1960, and 8.3 million in 1995.6 The population rate is expected to continue to
rise and Senegal is estimated to have a population of 18 million by the year 2021. In 1950, 30.5
percent of the population lived in urban areas and it is estimated that in 2010, 51.7 percent, and in
2025, 62.2 percent will live in urban areas.' These percentages correspond to a population of
762,000 urban habitants in 1950, and an estimated 10.5 million in 2025.8
1.06    There is sustained migration from rural to urban areas, particularly to Dakar. Forty-four
percent of Dakar's population are immigrants, aged 25 to 34. Dakar had an estimated growth rate
of 5 percent from 1970 to 1975, and 4.2 percent from 1990 to 1995.9 The population of Dakar
has grown from 18,000 in 1902, to 1.5 million in 1993 (48.2 percent of the urban population and
22 percent of the total population). It is expected to reach 2.3 million by the year 2000. The
remaining 47 Senegalese municipalities are all considerably smaller than Dakar. Today, the
largest municipalities include Thies with a population of 353,000, Kaolack with 201,000, and
Saint Louis with 199,000.'0 The urban areas are not equipped for the large migration, forcing
immigrants to settle in inhabitable, under served neighborhoods. This rapid pace of expansion
severely tests the capacity of municipalities to efficiently deliver basic urban services and manage
economic, environmental and investment resources.
1.07    Investments in urban infrastructure have increased over the past years, supported by a
number of externally funded projects. With the emergence of the decentralization process,
municipalities are faced today with the crucial issue of deciding, in a context of limited financial,
technical and human resources, what to deliver (priorities), where to deliver it, who should be the
primary beneficiaries, and how it should be financed, managed and maintained.
C. Previous Experiences in the Urban Development Sector
1.08    The first World Bank urban development project worldwide and the first Senegal urban
project, Sites and Services (Cr. 336 SE, approved in FY72), focused on housing and delivered
15,200 serviced plots in Dakar and Thies. Despite the many problems identified during
implementation, the philosophy of affordable housing solutions for low-income beneficiaries was
accepted. However, the scope of the operation was too ambitious.1 l The second urban project,

Technical Assistance Project for Urban Management and Rehabilitation (Cr. 1458/SF13,
approved in FY84), dealt with municipal finance, housing, and urban service delivery in Dakar.
The third urban project, Municipal and Housing Development Project (Cr. 1884 SE, approved in
FY88), completed in January 1997, incorporated the findings of the previous projects to address
Dakar's infrastructure, finance, and housing needs. In addition, the project initiated municipalities
into credit procedures and program evaluations.'2
1.09   The Public Works and Employment Project (Cr. 2075-SE, approved in FY90), created an
autonomous agency, AGETIP, to carry out procurement and supervision of public works. The
lessons learned, which have been implemented in the Second Public Works Project (Cr. 2369 SE,
approved in FY93 and closed in June 1997), include: (a) requiring the deposit of counterpart
funds before the review of sub-projects to offset the slow disbursement of funds by the
government; (b) increasing community participation and taking into account local priorities and
constraints; and (c) considering the proposed project's impact on current projects.
1.10   While the previous two Public Works Projects have been successful in the provision of
urban services, they have not addressed the crucial issue of transferring responsibility to local
governments for programming, financing and maintenance of these services and infrastructure.
1.11   The Urban Development and Decentralization Program (UDDP) responds to the overall
strategic framework including: (a) the Senegalese Decentralization Policy; (b) the Bank's
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS); (c) the Senegal Policy Framework Paper (1995-98); and (d)
the recent sector work on the Future of African Cities. The priority given to the Dakar region,
justified by the dominant position of the capital city and the scope of the issues, should no longer
exclude activities in other cities, especially within the policy framework of reinforcing municipal
institutions and regional development.
1.12   It is worth noting, relevant experiences financed by other donors, such as the French
Ministry of Cooperation's project in support of decentralization, PADDUS (Projet d'Appui a la
Decentralisation et au Developpement Urbain du Senegal). Executed by the Ministry of Public
Works, Transport, Housing and Urban Planning, it focused on strengthening the liaison between
decentralization and urban development through (a) decentralization and urban development
training; (b) education; and (c) tool identification. An evaluation of this project has been
completed and lessons will be integrated in the UDDP.
D. The Institutional Environment: Decentralization Trends
1.13   The Government of Senegal (GOS) has pursued  a progressive, yet cautious
decentralization policy since independence in 1960. The first phase saw the creation of
municipalities and regional development committees including municipal and rural councils. 13
1.14   The second phase of the decentralization policy began in 1990 and aimed at increasing
the local government's responsibilities in the management of local affairs. Although these
reforms brought about a better definition of roles and responsibilities of local governments, they

Decentralisation. 1996. p5.

were not linked to the transfer of financial or technical resources, both essential to municipal
development. 14
1.15   Finally, the adoption of legislative reforms in February 1996, and the modification of the
Code of Local Governments (Code des Collectivites locales), mark the third and latest phase of
the Senegalese decentralization policy, including the creation of a fund, the FDD (Fonds de
Dotation de la Decentralisation/ Fund for the Endowment of the Decentralization), to ensure the
transfer of financial resources to support the transfer of competencies.15
The reforms and their impact are discussed in the Recent Trends in Decentralization Policy,
included in ANNEX 2.
Who is what today in the institutional landscape?
1.16   At the central government level, the main actors are:
(a) The Ministry of Economy, Finance and Plan (Ministere de I 'Economie, des Finances
et du Plan) oversees Senegal's finances, defines the economic plan for Senegal, and
coordinates development activities. The Ministry supervises the Department of the
Treasury (Direction du Tresor (DTCP)). The Ministry is keen to initiate real transfers
to relieve some of its financial burden.
(b) The Ministry of Public Works and Transport, and the Ministry of Housing and
Urban Planning (Ministere de l'Equipement et des Transports Terrestre et le
Ministere de l'Urbanisme et de l'Habitat) provide assistance to municipalities in
construction, subdivision, and urban planning. The Ministries have not been very
involved at the local level but they are planning to have a greater role at the regional
level in supporting the physical planning activities of local governments.
(c) The Ministry of the Interior (Ministere de l 'Interieur) includes, beyond its traditional
security functions, a Ministry delegated to Decentralization (Ministere Delegue
aupr&s de l 'Interieur Charge de la Decentralisation) which has the important task of
managing the FECL (Fonds d'Equipement des Collectivites Locales). The Ministry
also supervises the Department of Local Governments (Direction des Collectivites
Locales (DCL)) which is responsible for the approval of municipal budgets and
allocation of the FECL.
(d) The Ministry of Urban Areas (Ministere de la Ville) is essentially a small think tank
on urban issues, with very limited implementation capabilities.
1.17   AGETIP has been, since its conception in 1990, an important actor in the provision of
urban services and has developed, over the years, some relationships with municipalities.
1.18   At the regional and local level, each of the ten administrative regions (Dakar, Diourbel,
Fatick, Kaolack, Kolda, Louga, Saint-Louis, Tambacounda, Thies, Ziguinchor) are under the
authority of a Governor appointed by the President. An elected mayor and municipal council
govern each of the 60 municipalities.  Overseen by the Ministry of the Interior, these
municipalities have only modest power and resources. Ineffective municipalities result from
elected figures who have no experience or knowledge of municipal management or finance,

infrequent municipal council meetings, insufficient resources, a lack of skilled personnel, a
complex bureaucracy, and lengthy decision making processes.
1.19   In principle, each municipality is responsible for the provision of basic services that are
essential to social and economic development, including the construction, rehabilitation and
maintenance of: (a) secondary and tertiary roads, drainage and lighting; (b) on-site sanitation and
solid waste services; (c) revenue generating facilities (bus stations, markets, slaughterhouses);
and (d) administrative/cultural facilities (health centers, schools, etc.). In practice,
implementation of these responsibilities is irregular. Local private enterprises and community
based organizations are rarely involved. There are some cases of conflicting overlaps between
the national and local authorities (ex. roads), and many cases where neither authority seems to be
concerned (ex. maintenance). The availability of resources does not match the level of
responsibilities.
1.20   The Mayors Association of Senegal (I'Association des Maires du Senegal (AM4S)) is the
only forum facilitating communication and dissemination of information among the mayors and
local officials. It has been widely associated in the preparation of the UDDP.
1.21   Non-governmental organizations (NGOs). The African Institute of Urban Management
(I 'Institut Africain de Gestion Urbaine) is active in municipal management, a key component of
the UDDP. Other NGOs in the urban sector include: (a) Plan International (le Plan International)
works on education campaigns primarily based in Dakar; (b) the African Society for Education
and Training for Development (la Societe Africaine d'Education et de Formation pour le
Developpement (SAFEFOD)) conducts training for local governments; (c) the Seven A (Appui a
l'Autopromotion des Adultes Appliquie a l 'Action par l 'Alternance et en Alternative (7A)) plans
education campaigns on urban management; (d) the Association for Economic and Social
Progress (Association pour une Dynamique du Progres Economique et Social (ADPES)) works
with local government institutional development; and (e) the Association for Action
(I'Association Conseil pour I'Action (ACA)) works with organizational financial management.
These NGOs can be useful in the promotion of increased local participation and education
campaigns aimed at improving the quality of life of the urban population.
E. Municipal and Intergovernmental Finance
The financial volume of municipalities
1.22   The financial volume of urban municipalities (including the urban community of Dakar
(CUD)) adds up to about 18 billion CFA francs per year (US$36 million), 6 percent of the
national budget (excluding external contributions). After C6te d'Ivoire, it is the second largest in
volume in the region, 16 but the first in terns of percentage of national revenues.
1.23   The financing capacity of municipalities varies considerably. On average, it amounts to
5,000 CFA francs per inhabitant,17 with a spread from I to 6 depending upon the size, the fiscal
potential and the fiscal effort provided by the municipality. 18 Not including Dakar, this average
26 The local lvorian sector, more important in number of municipalities and in population, attains 30 billion CFA francs (60 million
dollars).
17 This data does not take into consideration the recent increase in the number of municipalities which has passed from 48 to 65 and
should continue to rise in the future.
"For example, Dakar (10,397 CFA francs per inhab.), Pikine (3,387 CFA francs per inhab.), Mbour (1,655 CFA francs per inhab.),
etc.



6
is a little below 3,000 CFA francs per inhabitant or two to three times the amount noted in
neighboring countries' secondary towns.
1.24   Dakar has 70 percent of the municipal financial capacity and 53 percent of the country's
urban population.19 Moreover, an estimated 95 percent of the country's fiscal potential is
concentrated in the Cap Vert region, due to the activity generated by the port of Dakar.
1.25   The municipalities devote 25 percent of their budget to investments, largely through
mechanisms such as the FECL, AGETIP and the MDF.20 The annual investment volume directly
financed by urban municipalities is evaluated at approximately 4 billion CFA francs. More than
80 percent of this total is financed through the FECL; the self financing derived from municipal
resources does not exceed 20 percent.
1.26   The negative evolution of the financial indicators during previous fiscal years can be
attributed to (a) an increase in management costs; (b) a decrease of resources due to the effects of
the devaluation; and (c) a liquidity gap due to the impact of the unified revenue collection (unicite
de caisse). In real terms, the municipalities have experienced a significant decrease in available
funds. Since 1995, improved public finances and the increased importance allocated by the
Government to the decentralization process has allowed for a partial improvement of the
situation.
The revenues of municipalities
1.27   The municipalities have at their disposal four categories of essentially fiscal revenues: (a)
the "ristournes"; (b) the local direct tax system (business tax, land taxes, "minimum fiscal"); (c)
municipal taxes and user fees (market fees, road fees, etc.); and (d) the FECL allocations
(reserved for investment). Credits and patrimonial revenues (alienation of state properties) are
embryonic. The bulk of municipal resources is managed by the central government on behalf of
municipalities: identification of the tax base, collection from taxpayers, availability of liquidity by
the Treasury.
1.28   Ristournes: Two State taxes, i.e. the tax on motorized vehicles and the capital gain tax
are refunded to municipalities on a 50 percent basis.21 The refunds, which operate in relationship
to the demographic importance of the municipalities, provide an equalization (cross subsidies)
between the municipalities. The total refunds represent on average between 10 percent and 15
percent of municipal revenues. The main, commonly-encountered problems are the under
evaluation of refunds and disbursement delays. The transfer of the management of these refunds
to the Direction of the Budget at the DCL appears to be the most appropriate solution.
1.29   The local direct tax system includes three taxes, totally allocated to the municipalities,
which include the business tax, the property tax (on built properties) and the "minimum fiscal"
tax:
* The valuation of the business tax base is complicated and accounts for a low level of tax
collection: there are more than 25 types and 300 categories of business taxes.22 It
19 It includes the following municipalities: Dakar, Pikine, Guediawaye, Rufisque and Bargny. Following the laws of February 1996,
two municipalities were added.

accounts for 20 billion CFA francs, which represents 0.5 percent of the GDP and
approximately 5 percent of Senegal's resources. Dakar and its surrounding region
represent 75 percent of these resources, approximately 15 billion CFA francs.
* The property tax represents 15 percent of all tax revenues and approximately US$3.6
million (1.8 billion CFA francs) for the 60 municipalities. The majority of the property
tax, 77 percent or US$2.8 million, is collected in Dakar. The remaining US$0.8 million is
collected in Dakar's neighboring municipalities where the property tax per inhabitant is
approximately US$0.5 (250 CFA francs). The property tax faces several main issues,
including the complexity of property valuation and the existence of numerous exemptions
benefiting retired individuals, primary residences and new construction. The exemptions,
based on the situation in Dakar, are inappropriate for smaller municipalities and limit the
municipal access to tax revenues. In five sample municipalities, less than 10 percent of
households were identified, and tax recovery from these households has rarely exceeded 40
to 50 percent.23
* The "minimum fiscal" is no longer collected in municipalities. This tax has traditionally
yielded very scarce revenues. The only substitute for it is the tax deducted from civil
servants' salaries and wages of private firms' employees ("at the source"). This substitute
poses specific distribution problems: the revenues from payroll deductions are mainly
allocated to Dakar, to the detriment of other contributing municipalities.
1.30   User fees and other direct and indirect taxes: Municipalities collect a variety of user
fees and other taxes. The direct taxes include a tax on business location, solid waste collection,
street sweeping, sewer use, commercial licenses, etc. The indirect taxes include a tax on
electricity, slaughterhouses, water, commercial advertisements, food inspection, entertainment,
rent, gas, cemetery, parking. The inadequate or nonexistent provision of municipal services limits
the user fee potentials from these services.24
1.31   FECL (Fonds d'Equipement des Collectivites Locales): Established on July 4, 1977, its
purpose is to provide municipalities with no interest loans or government grants to finance and
carry out municipal projects. Since its creation, there have been no FECL loans, all FECL funds
have been allocated as grants. The FECL funding includes both ordinary funds (for municipalities
outside Dakar) and special funds (for all municipalities including Dakar and rural communities).
At the time of its creation in 1977, it was expected that 4 billion CFA francs would be channeled
through the FECL per year. On the average, about 2.5 billion CFA francs has been made
available. There are a number of issues related to the effectiveness of the FECL. They can be
summarized as follows: (a) the annual amount and allocation per municipality is decided by the
ministry in charge of decentralization (DCL), on the basis of unclear criteria, leaving room for
political interference; (b) the mechanisms of access to FECL funds are complicated and time
consuming; and (c) when all steps have been completed, funds may not be available. The new
reformns on the regionalization, introduced in January 1997, anticipate that the soon-to-be-created
regional councils will also be eligible for FECL funding and that FECL funding will be sustained
and replenished through a charge on VAT (value added tax).

1.32   Senegal has had an encouraging experience of financing municipal investments. The
FECL, in spite of its weaknesses, represents an important support for the development of new
municipal investments. Another source of municipal investmnent financing has been the Municipal
Development Fund (MDF or Compte de Credit Communal), created in 1989, through the
Municipal and Housing Development Project. This line of credit has contributed to the
sensitization of elected officials to the culture of borrowing for revenue-earning facilities.
However, its impact in terms of volume of activities has been limited due to internal constraints
such as high interest rates and cumbersome selection criteria, as well as external constraints like
the introduction of other competitive sources of funding (AGETIP). Finally, AGETIP has
channeled an important share of donors' funds towards municipalities on attractive terms. With
the closing of AGETIP 2, in June 1997, and the lessons learned from the MDF, the need to
simplify and rationalize the financing mechanisms for municipal investments has been at the
forefront of the Government's agenda. The UDDP aims to address this need.

II. The Program
A. Program Development Objectives
2.01   This program supports the Senegalese Decentralization Policy and aims at gradually
shifting responsibility and accountability, in terms of delivery and maintenance of urban services,
and infrastructure to municipalities. The program's objectives are: (a) to improve the financial
and organizational management of municipalities; (b) to improve the programming of priority
urban investments; (c) to rationalize and simplify the financing of urban investments; and (d) to
upgrade basic infrastructures in urban and some rural communities.
2.02   A sector policy letter has been formulated by the Senegalese Government for the UDDP.
This letter is the government's agreement to adopt and implement measures related to the
institutional and financial environment of the UDDP. The key aspects of the letter are: (a) the
creation of the MDA and its role in supporting municipalities; (b) agreements between the
Senegalese Government, the MDA, the contract management agency (CMA), and the financial
institutions; and (c) agreements concerning municipal finance: (i) mobilization of local resources
through fiscal reform, and (ii) commitments to mobilize the FECL and the FDD. A copy of the
sector policy letter is attached as ANNEX 1.
B. Program Components
2.03   The principal components are:
(1) capacity building of central and local governments through (a) the implementation
of a Municipal Adjustment Program (MAP) based on a municipal contract, a binding
agreement between the MDA and municipalities, and (b) support activities aimed at
providing an enabling environment for these Municipal Adjustment Programs to take
place (training, fiscal reforms study, etc.); and
(2) physical investments including the construction, rehabilitation and maintenance of
public infrastructure, facilities and services under the responsibility of local
governments, including: (a) roads, drainage and lighting; (b) education and health
facilities; (c) socio-collective facilities; (d) administrative and technical buildings; (e)
revenue generating facilities (markets, bus stations); (f) environmental sub-projects
(on-site sanitation and solid waste management); and (h) rehabilitation of historic
buildings. A catalogue of investments has been prepared during project preparation
which provides a menu of eligible sub-projects.
(A) Institutional Development Component
Municipal Contract and Audits
2.04    The municipal contract is a binding agreement between the MDA and municipalities,
signed by the municipality and the Municipal Development Agency (MDA), the government-
delegated executing agency for the UDDP. The contract includes the two components previously
mentioned: a Municipal Adjustment Program (MAP) and a Priority Investment Program (PIP).
2.05   All 60 Senegalese municipalities are eligible for a municipal contract as long as they
follow the steps established in the MDA's Manual of Procedures. These steps include: (a)
submitting a request to the MDA (Dossier de Candidature); (b) completing an urban audit to



10
identify a Priority Investment Program (PIP); (c) completing a financial and organizational audit
to determine the financial capacity of the municipality, and the content of its Municipal
Adjustment Program; and (d) preparing and negotiating the municipal contract.
2.06   The Urban Audit will use the IFS (Inventaire pour la Programmation des Infrastructures
et Equipements/ Inventory of Infrastructure and Services), to (a) review the patterns of urban
expansion; (b) highlight gaps in the level and location of infrastructure and services, and (c)
identify a PIP.25
2.07   The Financial and Organizational Audit will be executed according the MDA's Manual
of Procedures, and will focus on (a) a review of the financial situation of the municipality
(budgets, accountability, taxes, treasury); (b) an evaluation of the municipal financial capacity,
especially the potential financial participation of the municipality in the project; and (c) the
identification of a Municipal Adjustrnent Program aimed at improving the financial management
of the municipality.
2.08   These audits have been elaborated during project preparation and will be readily
available by the MDA to all municipalities. They have been tested during project preparation and
at time of negotiations, eight municipal contracts for Diourbel, Kaffrine, Louga, Joal-Fadiouth,
Guediawaye, Mbour, NGuekhokh, and Passi using these audits have been almost completed. The
audits will be carried out under the supervision of MDA and will be free of charge to
municipalities.
Support Activities
2.09   Support activities are targeted at two levels: the local government level in the framework
of the municipal contracts, and the central government level (i.e., the Departments of Treasury,
Urban Planning, Housing and Public Works, and Local Governments).
2.10   The purpose of such activities is to create an enabling environment in which municipal
development can take place and respond, in the most pragmatic way, to specific needs of
municipalities. They are summarized in ANNEX 4.
2.11   The MDA will provide, at the request of the municipality or the Senegalese Government,
administrative and technical assistance for both municipalities and the Senegalese Government,
according to the limits of the municipal contract or resources allocated to the central Government.
2.12   Generic training is already provided by other donors. Training needs will be identified
during project implementation, and programs will be tailored to meet these specific needs. The
project will work with existing training centers whose capacity has been evaluated during project
preparation. The urban and municipal management training centers in Dakar include: (a) ENAM
(Ecole National d'Administration et de Magistrature), the National School for Administration,
focuses on general and territorial administration, public finance, and educational methods; and
(b) CFP/CUD, the Center for Training for the Urban Area of Dakar, (Centre de Formation et
Perfectionnement de la Communaute Urbaine de Dakar) is involved in training, financial
analysis, and management accounting.

2.13   As a complement to the UDDP preparation, the Canadian International Development
Agency (CIDA) is carrying out a study on fiscal reforms which largely builds upon the diagnosis
and recommendations of the UDDP feasibility study. This study should be completed during
1998, and implementation of reforms related to the simplification of the local fiscal system,
operational tools for tax base identification and tax collection, and simplification of FECL
mechanisms will be carried out after the second year of project implementation.
(B) Physical Investments Component
2.14   Based on the Urban Audit, each municipality will be able to identify a Priority
Investment Program (PIP) and a Priority Maintenance Program (PMP). Each investment must:
(a) respond to municipal priorities as defined in the urban audit; (b) be compatible with municipal
financial capacity; (c) be maintained and/or upgraded by the municipality; and (d) be
environmentally and socially sound.
2.15   A Catalogue of Municipal Projects has been prepared during project preparation on the
basis of the formulation of municipal contracts in Louga, Diourbel and Kaffrine. This catalogue,
conceived in collaboration with the municipal teams and AGETIP, is a menu of eligible sub-
projects including sample plans and unit costs. This menu will facilitate informed decisions on
the choice of priority investments matching municipal financing capacity. Seven categories have
been selected: (a) infrastructure (roads, drainage, public lighting); (b) health and education
facilities; (c) administrative facilities (mayors offices, government offices, tax centers); (d) social
facilities; (e) revenue generating facilities (market, bus station); (f) environmental projects; and
(g) rehabilitation of historic areas. Each sub-project will be screened on the basis on three
evaluation forms included in the Catalogue of Municipal Projects. A table of contents for the
Catalog of Municipal Projects is included in ANNEX 13.
Maintenance
2.16  Improved maintenance of municipal investments is indispensable. This task falls under
the responsibility of municipalities and is rarely effectively carried out. The reasons are diverse:
(a) lack of a sense of ownership by the beneficiaries, (b) absence of a maintenance program, (c)
weak interest of local authorities for this type of operation, and (d) lack of financial and technical
resources.
2.17   The UDDP is attempting to address this issue and proposes to implement the following
procedures: (a) identification of a minimum maintenance program in the urban audits (equivalent
to 3 percent of current municipal revenues); (b) in the largest towns, a classification will be done
between the maintenance work which could be delegated to CMA (mainly on the networks), and
those to be executed by the municipality (mainly cleaning); (c) complementary financial
participation by the municipality to finance the maintenance work which will be delegated to
CMA4; (d) for those executed directly by the municipality, close monitoring under the municipal
contract. The success of the maintenance program will be ensured through close involvement of
beneficiaries in project identification and planning as well as capacity development at the
municipal and community level. The community's maintenance capacities will be one of the
project selection criteria for rural infrastructure projects.



12
C. Costs and Financing
2.18   UDDP will benefit from the following lines of financing:
* External sources: the IDA credit will finance US$75 million. Other donors, attracted
by the framework provided by UDDP, will participate in parallel financing. For
example, the CFD has planned to contribute in the amount of US$ 10 million.
* Local sources: there are three main sources (a) annual allocation from the FECL of 1
billion CFA francs per year during the Program, equivalent to US$8.3 million over the
5 year program for PAC 1 and 2 and 900 million CFA francs or US$1.5 million for
PAC 3); (b) undisbursed balance of FECL initially allocated to the Municipal
Development Fund (CCC) which will be reaffected to UDDP (about 3 billion CFA
francs or US$5 million); and (c) counterpart funding by municipalities or rural
communities (under three options: PAC 1 and 10 percent local counterpart funding or
PAC 2 and 10 percent local counterpart funding and 20 percent credit or PAC3 and 10
percent local counterpart funding).
2.19   The financing plan is based on the following principles:
* Financing through UDDP is open to all municipalities (communes) of Senegal;
* All municipalities must have signed a Municipal Contract (i.e. they have identified, on
the basis of the urban audit, a PIP (Priority Investment Program) and, on the basis of
the financial and organizational audit, a MAP (Municipal Adjustment Program)).
* The "guichets" are being harmonized along three modes of financing:
* Mode 1 or PAC 1: the conditions are extremely favorable, that is 90 percent subsidies
through the IDA credit and 10 percent local counterpart funding.
* Mode 2 or PAC 2: the conditions proposed are still very favorable but a bit more
demanding on municipalities: 70 percent subsidies through the IDA credit, 20
percent credit, and 10 percent local counterpart funding. The credit is 4.25 percent
over 12 years and is reimbursable on a monthly basis.
- Mode 3 or PAC 3: this is a guichet for financing rural community needs on the
following basis, 90 percent subsidies through the IDA credit and 10 percent local
counterpart funding.
The allocation of PAC 1 and 2 will be done on the following basis:
* PAC 1: PAC 1 represents 50 percent of the amount of the physical investment
component (US$25 million or 15 billion CFA francs). Every municipality will benefit
from PAC 1. The amount of PAC 1 allocation to a municipality is based on its
population (i.e. on average FCFA 3550 per inhabitant). The amount per municipality
cannot be inferior to FCFA 75 million so that a minimal investment program can be
carried out.
* PAC 2: PAC 2 represents the remaining 50% of the amount of the physical investment
component (US$25 million or 15 billion CFA francs)). The envelop per municipality
is based on the financial capacity of the municipality and cannot exceed 6% of the
average monthly revenues of the municipality. The ceiling is modest enough to allow
the additional mandatory contribution by the municipality to Priority Maintenance
Program.
Envelopes per municipality and financing mechanisms can be found in ANNEX 5.
* PAC 3: PAC 3 represents US$15 million and focuses exclusively on rural communities.



13
2.20   These conditions aim at preventing any dysfunctional patterns such as (a) the excessive
competition among the various modes of financing; (b) taking into consideration the weak
financial capacity of municipalities which could not self finance and borrow in large amounts; (c)
prevent the liquidity issue of large annual reimbursement through a spread of both self-financing
and credit reimbursement on a monthly basis.
Flow of funds
2.21   ANNEX 6 summarizes the flow of funds. The main features are the following:
* Financing is coming from three sources: (1) municipal counterpart through both self-
financing and credit reimbursement made on a monthly basis; (2) the contribution from
the central government through the annual FECL allocation; and (3) IDA and other
donors allocated to municipalities as credit or subsidies.
* Financing is available for two types of activities: the Priority Investment Programs and
the Municipal Adjustment programs. The funds will be made available to either the
Municipal Development Agency or the Delegated Contract Management Agency
according to their final destination.
* Municipalities pay monthly contributions (under PAC 2) to the Municipal Development
Agency to a special account opened at the Treasury. These funds are then split by the
MDA between the CMA account, opened at the Treasury for the municipal counterpart,
and the ADM account opened at a financial institution for the credit part.
* The central government pays the annual FECL allocation to the MDA account opened
at the Treasury and the left over from the CCC to the MDA account at a financial
institution.
* IDA funds the CMA account at a financial institution for the PIP and the MDA account
at a financial institution for the Municipal Adjustment Program. In total this requires
the opening of two accounts at the Treasury, one for MDA and one for CU4 as well as
the opening of two accounts at a financial institution, one for MDA and one for CM4.
2.22   This system enables CMA to have funds readily available and accommodate its
disbursements needs. The replenishment of CAL4 accounts (at the Treasury and a financial
institution) will be done every three months on the basis of committed annual investment
programs (devis programmes). The beginning of works will be conditional to the payment by
municipalities of their monthly dues which become mandatory as soon as the municipal contract
is signed.



14
III. Program Implementation
A. Institutional Arrangements
3.01   A participatory process has been emphasized throughout program preparation. Three
seminars have been held, including a two day seminar in March 1995 which was attended by
over 100 representatives, including 48 mayors, to discuss the institutional framework of the
program and the Feasibility study. The study was prepared in collaboration with the Senegalese
Government, local experts and the Program Preparation Unit (PPU). Additional PPU activities
include: (a) coordinating with the different Ministries, central and local governments and NGOs;
(b) working with secondary cities to: (i) analyze past experiences, local management systems and
technical capacities, (ii) complete audit proposals, and (iii) simulate future municipal contracts;
and (c) update data bases on the financial status of the 60 municipalities.
3.02   The different actors who will participate in the execution of the project, include: (a) the
Senegalese Government, (b) the MDA, (c) municipalities, (d) the Mayors Association of Senegal
and the Association of rural communities Presidents, (e) accepted contract management agencies,
(f) financial institutions, (g) the private sector (contractors, consultants and the beneficiary
population).
3.03   The Municipal Development Agency (MDA) has been created, as the government
delegated executing agency for the UDDP. A manual of procedures defines the MDA's role and
operational procedures. The MDA will: (a) assist municipalities in the preparation of municipal
contracts and implementation of their Municipal Adjustment Programs; (b) implement and
supervise support activities; and (c) work closely with the contract management agency. The
MDA will hire consultants to complete the audits necessary for the preparation of the municipal
contract. Although the MDA will not oversee the implementation of physical components of the
project, a task which will be assigned to a contract management agency (AGETIP), it will,
however, supervise the implementation of all municipal contracts and make sure that any
problems in the implementation of the MAP be anticipated so not to endanger the implementation
of the PIP.
3.04   The maximum processing time for each step of the project process is:

3.05   The board members of the MDA include, among others, the Minister of Economy,
Finance and Plan, Minister of Decentralization, President of the Association of Mayors and
Director of the MDA. The collaborative, independent relationship between the MDA and the

administration will enable the MDA to maximize its position of neutrality in decision making
while maintaining close contact with the government.
3.06   The Senegalese Government is responsible for the: (a) allocation of the amount of the
FECL; (b) provision of administrative assistance to guarantee the creation and functioning of the
MDA; and (c) insurance of legislative and local fiscal reforms to assist the MDA's objectives.
3.07   Municipalities elaborate, negotiate and sign a municipal contract, prepare an investment
plan, work with the MDA on studies and financing, and work with a contract management
agency on project implementation.27
3.08   A Contract Management Agency (CMA) will be the primary agency to execute and
supervise the investment program defined in the municipal contract. Once a municipal contract
has been negotiated and signed, the contract management agency will proceed with project
implementation, including bidding procedures and execution of works. AGETIP will be the
primary CMA for PACI and PAC2 and will be the executing agency for PAC3.
3.09   All studies and projects will be implemented by private sector firms. As is currently the
practice, the CMA does not execute any operations itself and, therefore, contracts out all the sub-
projects to local consultants, entrepreneurs and suppliers in order to maximize the participation of
local entrepreneurs and generate employment through labor intensive approaches to public
works. Contracting enables the municipality and the CMA to avoid hiring additional technical
staff and remain focused on increasing work quality and developing skills of managers and
workers. An improved quality of work will be obtained through training consultants and
contracting staff, tightening classification criteria for contract awards, and improving supervision
of work.
B. Procurement
3.10   A Country Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR) was carried out in July 1994. For
the program, findings of the CPAR remain valid. In general, Senegal's procurement laws and
regulations do not conflict with IDA Guidelines. No special exceptions, permits, or licenses need
to be specified in the Credit documents for International Competitive Bidding (ICB), since
Senegal's procurement practices allow IDA procedures to take precedence over any contrary
provisions in local regulations. IDA-financed Works and Goods will be procured in accordance
with Bank's Guidelines under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits (January 1995, revised in January
and August 1996). National Competitive Bidding (NCB) advertised locally would be carried out
in accordance with Senegal's procurement laws and regulations, acceptable to IDA provided that:
(i) any bidder is given sufficient time to submit bids (four weeks); (ii) bid evaluation and bidder
qualification are clearly specified in bidding documents; (iii) no preference margin is granted to
domestic manufacturers; (iv) eligible firms are not precluded from participation; (v) award will
be made to the lowest evaluated bidder; and (vi) prior to issuing the first call for bids, draft
standard bidding documents are submitted to IDA and found acceptable. Consultant Services
contracts financed by IDA will be procured in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for the
Selection of Consultants by World Bank Borrower published in January 1997. Table 3.1 below
summarizes project costs by disbursement category and procurement methods.

Note: figures in parentheses are the respective amount financed by the IDA credit
3.11   Civil works. Generally speaking, civil engineering contracts (construction, rehabilitation
of street pavements, primary classrooms, primary health centers, drainage cleaning, etc.) should
relate to amounts under US$500,000 equivalent. If the contract amount exceeds this threshold,
the ICB procedures in agreement with the Bank Guidelines for Procurement (January 1995,
revised in January and August 1996) will be applied. Contracts are not expected to exceed US$10
million. The Bank Standard Bidding Documents for works (Droit Civil) under ICB will be used.
Contracts under the threshold (US$500,000) will be awarded using the CMA's Manual of
Procedures. The manual will include National Competitive Bidding (NCB), based on the
standard bidding documents of the Manual of Procedures and a register of approved enterprises,
which are acceptable to IDA. The CMA will maintain a record of entrepreneurs eligible for



17
participation in NCB, which will remain open during project execution so that new candidates
can be admitted at any time. Prequalification criteria spelled out in the CMA's Manual of
Procedures is typical of that used in works' contracts. The procedure will consist essentially of a
local announcement of a proposed contract for a given project to the enterprises listed in the
register. Notices will be published in local newspapers, informning potential bidders that have not
yet asked to be registered by the CMA. Contracts for small works estimated to cost less than
US$50,000 per contract, up to an aggregate amount of US$1 million, would be procured under
lump-sum, fixed-price contracts awarded on the basis of quotations obtained from three qualified
domestic contractors invited to bid by way of discounts either on the total price or on the unit
prices. The invitation shall include reference unit prices established by an engineer/architect, a
detailed description of the works, including basic specifications, the required completion period,
a basic form of agreement acceptable to IDA, and relevant drawings, where applicable. The
award would be made to contractor who offers the lowest price quotation for the required work,
provided he demonstrates he has the experience and resources to complete the contract
successfully.
3.12   Consutants Services. Consulting services financed by IDA would be for: (i) studies:
urban audits, financial audits, designs, preparation of bidding documents, data collection,
accounting systems, financial management supports, and impact analysis; (ii) consultancies on
technical matters and training: skills gap analysis, skills development; and (iii) training of
municipal personnel and central government staff. Consultants financed by IDA, totaling US$9.5
million, would be hired in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for the Selection and
Employment of Consultants (January 1997). It would be addressed through competition among
qualified short-listed firms in which the selection will be based on Quality-and Cost-Based
Selection (QCBS), by evaluating the quality of the proposal before comparing the cost of the
services to be provided. For audits of project finances, and any missions of a standard nature, the
Least-Cost Selection would be the most appropriate method -- the firm with the lowest price will be
selected, provided its technical proposal received the minimum mark. Consultants services for
advisory services on capacity building (estimated to cost less than US$100,000 per contract and up
to an aggregate of US$500,000) would be based on Consultants' Qualifications taking into account
the consultants' experience and competence relevant to the assignment. Services for small studies,
which can be delivered by Individual Consultants, would be selected through comparison of
qualifications among those expressing interest in the assignment or approached directly. Single
Source Selection would be exceptionally used for selecting the CMA. The Government of Senegal
proposed to select AGETIP as Contract Management Agency (CMA) for the execution of PIP
under the first municipal contracts agreed during the first project year; in case of need, after the end
of the first year, selection of any other CMA would be handled in accordance with the Guidelines
for the use of consulting services.
3.13   For training abroad and in-country training sessions, the programs, containing names of
candidates, cost estimates, content of courses, period of training, institutions selected, would be
reviewed by IDA annually.
3.14   Short-lists for contracts estimated under US$100,000 may be comprised entirely of
national consultants, if a sufficient number of qualified firms (at least three) are available locally
at competitive costs. This would particularly apply to contracts for architectural and engineering
services. However, if foreign firms have expressed interest for those contracts, they will not be
excluded from consideration. The standard Letter of Invitation and Form of Contract, as
developed by the Bank, will be used for appointment of consultants. Simplified contracts will be



18
used for short-term assignments, i.e. those not exceeding six months, carried out by firms or
individual consultants. The Government has been briefed during appraisal and has received
additional clarification during negotiations about the features of the new Consultants Guidelines,
in particular with regards to advertisement and public bid opening.
3.15   Procurement for Goods. Goods would normally be procured through ICB procedures in
accordance with Bank's Guidelines for Procurement (January 1995, revised in January and
August 1996). However Contracts for goods (including office equipment and supplies,
computers, vehicles, and furniture) to be procured several times during project implementation
are not likely to be grouped into a package exceeding US$200,000 equivalent. These items are
not expected to attract foreign bidders because of their small size and because of the diversity of
site and period delivery, will be awarded on the basis of NCB, in accordance with procedures
acceptable to IDA. Items, not exceeding US$30,000 individually, and totaling US$300,000,
mostly office supplies, would be purchased through International Shopping, and items not
exceeding US$20,000 individually, and totaling US$200,000, would be purchased through
National Shopping by soliciting quotations from at least three reliable suppliers (in two different
countries in the case of International Shopping).
3.16   Review by IDA. IDA will examine the roster of contractors and will ensure the
procedures conform with the Manual of Procedures. IDA-financed contracts above the value of
US$200,000 equivalent for CMA works and goods, will be subject to IDA's prior review.
Documentation for contracts under these thresholds will be maintained for ex-post reviews by
auditors and IDA supervisory staff. In addition, for all contracts for works, for which there are
less than five bidders or for any decision not to select the lowest evaluated bid, the CMA will
submit its proposal to IDA for approval, prior to notifying the winning bidder. During
negotiations draft bidding documents for NCB were reviewed and agreed upon with IDA. IDA
prior review for the hiring of consultants will include the review of budgets, terms of reference,
short-lists, selection procedures, letters of invitation, evaluation reports, proposals for contract
award and draft negotiated contracts. Prior review will not apply to contracts for the recruitment
of consulting firms and individuals estimated to cost less than US$100,000 and US$50,000
equivalent respectively. However, the exception to prior IDA review will not apply to the Terms
of Reference of such contracts, regardless of value, to single-source hiring, to assignments of a
critical nature as determined by IDA, or to amendments of contracts raising the contract value
above the prior review threshold. For consultant contracts estimated above US$200,000, opening
the financial envelopes will take place only after issuance of Bank's no-objection to the technical
evaluation. For contracts estimated to cost less than US$200,000 and more than US$ 100,000 the
borrower will notify IDA of the results of the technical evaluation prior to opening the financial
proposals.  Documents related to procurement below the prior review thresholds will be
maintained by the borrowers for ex-post review by auditors and by IDA supervision missions.
3.17   Procurement Status of Ongoing Projects and Proposed Arrangements. National
Bidding Procedures for public sector procurement in Senegal have proven slow and cumbersome
in several past and on-going IDA-financed projects. A revised procurement code is expected to
be approved by the national Assembly; the introduction of simplified procedures and training of
staff which would accompany the issuance of the new procurement code would normally
improve the current situation. Under previous IDA-financed projects (Urban and Public Works
Projects), central Government already gained a substantial experience of Bank's procedures.
Procurement would be managed by MDA and the CMA. The newly created MDA will handle
consultants services for the definition of municipal contracts and will be staffed with



19
professionals with sufficient experience, mostly from the private sector. It will also: (i) hire
individual consultants and ad hoc short-term consultant services as required; and (ii) organize
training sessions as necessary. AGETIP which has been selected by the Goveinment as CMA
has the capacity to handle procurement of public works.
3.18   Procurement Schedule. The General Procurement Notice (GPN) for the project was
issued during negotiations. Standard processing times for the different types of procurement
were discussed during negotiations and included in the implementation manual as well as in the
MDA's Manual of Procedures. The Government has given assurance at negotiations that it will
take the necessary measures to ensure that procurement phases do not exceed the following target
time periods:
Procurement Phases                     Maximum number of weeks
* Preparation of bidding documents     4 (12 for large contracts)
* Preparation of bids by bidders       4 (12 for ICB)
* Bid evaluation                       2 (4 for large contracts)
* Signature of contracts               2
* Payments                             4
3.19   During negotiations, the Government submitted to IDA: (a) a draft procurement plan for
the first two program years; (b) two draft Manuals of Procedures for MDA and AGETIP for
Program Management and Implementation including target time periods for the various
procurement phases; (c) three municipal contracts ; (d) standard bidding documents to be used
under NCB procedures for civil works and goods. During negotiations, agreement was reached
on the proper monitoring of procurement, as well as the standard procurement documents to be
used for NCB. The Government gave assurance at negotiations that it will: (a) use Manuals of
procedures for Program Management and Implementation; (b) use the Bank's Standard Bidding
Documents for ICB and the Standard Bid Evaluation reports; (c) apply the procurement
procedures and arrangements outlined in the above documents; and (d) review the procurement
plan and procurement arrangements each year at the annual review with IDA and other donors.
The Government will submit a final version of the Operational Manual before Credit
effectiveness. During implementation, all bidding documents, bid evaluation reports, and draft
contracts transmitted to IDA for review will contain an updated copy of the procurement plan.
Procurement information will be collected and recorded as follows: (a) prompt recording of
contract award information by the Borrower; and (b) semi-annual reports to the Bank by the
Borrower indicating: (i) revised cost estimates for individual contracts and the total program,
including best estimates of allowances for contingencies; (ii) revised timing of estimated
procurement actions, including experience with completion time and completion costs for
individual contracts; and (iii) compliance with aggregate limits on specified methods of
procurement.
3.20   Contracts Financed by Other Institutions.  The MDA's Manual of Procedures
provides for the case of parallel financing by another donor, which will decide the procedures to
be followed. If there were to be joint financing or administration by IDA, the procedure used
would conform to the Bank's guidelines for procurement.

FY = IDA fiscal year, e.g. FY 96 = July 1, 1995 - June 30, 1996.
3.22   The Disbursement of the Credit would be fully documented, except for expenditures
valued at less than US$200,000 equivalent for works, US$150,000 equivalent for goods,
US$100,000 equivalent for consulting firms, and US$50,000 equivalent for individual
consultants, all of these would be made against the Statements of Expenditures (SOEs).
Documentation for withdrawal under SOEs would be retained by MDA and AGETIP for review
by IDA supervision and for annual and quarterly audits. To facilitate disbursements, MDA and
AGETIP would respectively open a Special Account in a commercial bank acceptable to IDA to
cover IDA's share of eligible expenditures managed by MDA and AGETIP. Based on the
disbursement experience of the previous projects, the authorized allocation for the MDA Special
Account (SA) would be equivalent to 1 billion CFA francs and the authorized allocation for
AGETIP Special Account (SA) would be equivalent to 300 million CFA francs. IDA would
make an initial deposit of that amount from the proposed credit upon credit effectiveness and



21
would replenish the SA upon receipt of satisfactory proof of incurred eligible expenditure.
Replenishment requests would be accompanied by up-to-date bank statements and reconciliation
of the SA.
3.23   MDA Management Fee. IDA will finance MDA's operating costs at one hundred
percent over the four first years. Then this contribution will be decreased to up to eighty percent
the fifth year with the remaining twenty percent to be covered through the monthly credit
payment made by municipalities. A financing plan for MDA's operating costs will be adopted at
the end of the project fifth year based on a digressive IDA contribution and an increasing share of
self-financing based on the monthly credit payment.
D. Auditing and Monitoring
3.24   Reporting and Accounting.  Following its manual of procedures, the MDA will
maintain the project accounts and issue periodic reports as follows: (i) summary monthly
bulletins, within a month; (ii) quarterly reports, within two months; (iii)an annual report, slightly
longer than an ordinary quarterly report, within three months; (iv) a detailed mid-term review
report, within two months after the review; and (v) a project completion report, within six months
of the closing date. Each of these reports, except the monthly bulletins, will be complemented by
consolidated accounts of the reference period.
3.25   Audits. The consolidated accounts will be audited by independent auditors acceptable to
IDA. The reports on the first legal semester of each year will be submitted to the Government
and IDA within four months. The annual audit report will be submitted within five months after
the end of the related year or after project closure, respectively. Auditors will review and
comment on expenses and special accounts (financial audit), management procedures
(management audit), and quality of works carried out (technical audit). Agreements on
periodicity and terms of reference of financial, technical, managerial, and environmental audits,
and on the short-list of potential auditing firms or joint-ventures was confirmed at negotiations.
The appointment of auditors acceptable to IDA, and with terms of reference acceptable to IDA,
will be a condition of credit effectiveness.
3.26   Performance Monitoring. A detailed set of performance indicators for municipalities,
MDA, and project effectiveness are described in ANNEX 16. Municipal contract implementation
progress will also be monitored on an annual basis and published in the press.
E. Supervision
3.27   Supervision Missions. The project will be supervised on a regular basis by visiting
Bank missions which will review progress, evaluate performance, visit works sites, scrutinize
project management, and evaluate the impact on the development of small firms and
employment.
3.28   Annual Reviews and Beneficiary Surveys. Annual reviews will be organized between
the Senegalese Government, MDA, municipalities and the Bank in order to evaluate the
effectiveness of the program. Program effects include: (a) the performance of the actors, (b) the
relevance of the performance indicators, and (c) the municipal contracts. Annual reviews will



22
include a one day workshop with representatives of all stakeholders and beneficiaries. Each
annual review will present a summary of beneficiary satisfaction with the program.
3.29   Mid-term Review. A more in-depth, mid-term review will be carried out at the end of
the second year of project implementation. The review will be an opportunity to discuss with a
larger group of stakeholders: mayors, central and regional government authorities, communities,
NGOs, and donors during a two-day workshop. This review will include an environmental
assessment of all sub-projects. With regard to decentralization, the review will take stock of the
progresses of municipal fiscal reforms, and draw lessons. The review will allow for modification
of project features to improve effectiveness.



23
IV. Benefits and Risks
A. Benefits
4.01   The program will support the decentralization process and promote a more active role for
municipalities. It will: (a) stimulate the capacity of local governments to efficiently program,
finance, execute and maintain facilities, as well as the delivery of services; (b) facilitate improved
municipal financial performance and contribute to the national institutional development
objectives, through a reduction of the public sector deficit; (c) impact economically and socially
the urban and rural population through: (i) reduced costs of and better access to municipal
services and basic rural infrastructure, and (ii) employment generation through sustained public
works activities.
Economic Analysis
4.02   An economic analysis of sub-projects was carried out during project preparation.
ANNEX 14 gives a detailed presentation of the methodology and conclusions of this sample
analysis. Each sub-project will be selected on the basis of its economic feasibility.
Impact on Poverty and Unemployment
4.03   The program will have an impact on a large percentage of the urban and rural population,
particularly in low-income, urban neighborhoods which currently endure inadequate levels of
services with serious environmental risks. The Priority Investment Program (PIP) is selected on
the basis of an inventory of basic infrastrcuture and services (Inventaire pour la Programmation
des Infrastructures et Equipements/IPIE), a tool which assesses and identifies gaps in the level of
neighborhood services. Each sub-project is then screened on the basis of a poverty impact
evaluation. Furthermore, the urban audit process places an emphasis on underserved areas and
aims to enhance the population's access to basic services.
Impact on the Environment
4.04   This category B program will facilitate sustainable improvements in the living and
working environment of Senegal's urban areas. The physical and socio-economic conditions of
the urban population will improve due to the upgrading of urban infrastructure and increased
provision of basic urban services. In order to ensure the physical components have a positive
impact on the urban environment, an environmental impact checklist will be included in the
preparation of the municipal contract. The checklist capitalizes on the 1993 final environmental
report (Etude sur l'Environnement Urbain au Sinigal) and the 1994 complementary study
(Compliment de l'Etude sur 1'Environnement Urbain au Senegal). The creation of a checklist
has the dual advantage of: (a) screening sub-projects in a more operational manner than with an
environmental assessment; and (b) enhancing the pedagogical value of raising local
governments' awareness of their proposed projects' environmental impact. Each sub-project will
be selected on the basis of an environmental impact evaluation form, highlighting specific
eligibility criteria. A copy of the environmental checklist is included in ANNEX 15.



24
4.05   The checklist data will result in a series of recommendations to be incorporated into the
municipal contract. The fulfillment of these recommendations will be supervised by the CMA
which reports to the MDA.
Impact on Capacity Building and Participation
4.06   Private Sector Development. The program will provide opportunities for consultants
and entrepreneurs to strengthen their technical and administrative skills. It is expected that a pool
of local consultants will immediately be trained at carrying out the financial and urban audits
elaborated during project preparation. A training program is also included for small scale
enterprises in order to improve the performance of public works enterprises. Finally, the
revenue-generating facilities such as markets and bus stations will be eligible to UDDP financing
if sound management of the facilities is included in the municipal contract and UDDP can
provide assistance with delegated management.
4.07   Municipal Development. Citizens and elected officials will better manage municipal
infrastructure, give a sense of ownership of the city, and establish a power balance between the
central and municipal governments. Furthermore the program will enhance rural communities
capacity in project formulation which will result in a quicker upgrade from village to
municipality level status.
Sustainability
4.08   The program is timely, considering the recent Decentralization reforms and the latest
municipal elections (December 1996). The tools to improve the programming of municipal
investments and the overall management of municipalities have been designed with the major
objective of being user-friendly and becoming, over time, part of common management practices.
The overall institutional framework of UDDP responds to the need to simplify and rationalize the
distribution of responsibilities among the various public and private actors in the financing and
delivery of infrastructure and services in a political climate which is today ripe for these changes.
B. Risks
4.09   The major program risks are: (a) introduction of parallel competitive, less demanding
sources of funding to municipalities by other donors; (b) inability of the Government to enact the
required fiscal reforms or effectively manage the decentralization program; (c) failure of
municipalities to implement the municipal adjustment programs or to reimburse their share of the
credit; and (d) unfavorable macroeconomic conditions during program execution.
4.10   These are important risks which cannot be ignored, although the rewards from the
successful implementation of the Program are also very high. Several factors reduce these risks:
(a) continued coordination with donors during project preparation and their adherence to the
Program as demonstrated in their willingness to participate in UDDP; (b) strong ownership
demonstrated by the Government's and municipalities' participation during project preparation;
and (c) a realistic assessment of the municipalities' financial capacity and a pragmatic Municipal
Adjustment Program catered to specific local circumstances and performances.



25
V. Agreements Reached and Recommendation
5.01   Prior to negotiations with IDA, the Government:
(a) adopted the Letter of Sectoral Policy; and
(b) created the Municipal Development Agency.
5.02   During negotiations the Government furnished the following documents:
(a) finalisation of three municipal contracts;
(b) draft manuals of procedures for MDA and AGETIP;
(c) draft convention between the Government, Association of Mayors and MDA;
(d) draft amendment to the convention between the Government and AGETIP;
(e) draft convention between the MDA and AGETIP;
(f) draft catalogue of municipal equipment; and
(g) list of selected sub-projects for rural communities.
5.03   During negotiations, the Government gave assurance that it will:
(a) allocate one billion F CFA for each year of the UDDP; allocate the remaining
balance from the Municipal Development Fund to the UDDP;

Lettre de Politique Sectorielle
I. LES ORIENTATIONS STRATEGIQUES
Depuis 1960, les pouvoirs publics ont opte pour un systeme administratif
decentralise. Des efforts consid6rables ont 6te consentis ces dernieres annees
pour att6nuer le desequilibre spatial, maitriser l'essor urbain et am6liorer le cadre
de vie.
En 1996, le processus de d6centralisation s'inscnt comme un element
essentiel du IXeme Plan. Ceci se traduit par les orientations specifiques suivantes:
* Renforcer le developpement des regions et la capacit6 des entites
decentralisees;
- D6velopper l'initiative prvee et accompagner les mutations dans le
domaine de l'auto-organisation:;
* Exprimer le d6sengagement de l'Etat par un cadre reglementaire
favorisont la synergie entre le secteur modeme et le secteur informel.
Cette lettre de politique sectorielle au Senegal a pour objectif de renforcer
la politique de d6centralisafion par la stimulation de l'effort de redressement des
collectivites locales d'une part, et de soutenir leur effort d'investissement, d'autre
part. Elle permet de replacer le Programme d'Appui aux Communes dans la
politique de deveioppement de ia decentralisation qui prend un nouvel essor
avec les lois de 1996.
11. LES PRINCIPALES ETAPES DE LA DECENTRALISATION (1960 - 1996)
Le Senegal, depuis son accession a la souverainet6 nationale, a opte pour
une politique de decentralisation progressive et prudente. Quelques dates
significatives illustrent cette evolution:
en 1960, le statut de commune de plein exercice est elargi a toutes les
communes;
en 1966, le Code de l'Administration Communcle est promulgue par la
loi n 66.64 du 30 juin 1966, reunissant en un texte de ref6rence unique,
les differentes lois qui regissaient l'institution communcle;
* en 1972, la loi n 72.25 du 25 avril 1972 cree des communautes rurales;
. en 1990, enfin, Ia loi n 90.35 du 8 octobre 1990 modifle 6 nouveau le
Code de r'Administration Communole et verse les communes 6 statut
sp6cial dons le droit commun: la loi n 90.37 du 8 octobre 1990 retire la



Annexe I
Page 2 / 7
gestion des communaut6s rurales aux sous-prefets et la remet entre les
mains des Presidents des Conseils ruraux.
L'adoption, en d6but d'annee 1996, de six nouveaux textes en mati&re de
d6centralisation marque une nouvelle 6tape: (1) loi n 96.06 portant Code des
Collectivites Locales, (2) loi no 96-07 portant transfert de competences aux
regions, aux communes et aux communaut6s rurcles, (3) loi n 96-08 modifiant le
Code electoral, (4) loi organique relative a ia limitation du cumul des mandats
electoraux et de certaines fonctions, (5) loi no 96.09 fixant l'organisation
administrative et financi&re de la commune d'arrondissement et ses rapports
avec la ville, (6) loi n 96-10 modifiant la loi n 72.02 du ler fevrier 1972 relative a
l'organisation de l'Administration territoriale. Un decret a 6te signe modifiant le
decret n 72.636 du 29 mai 1972 relatif aux attributions des chefs de
circonscriptions administratives et des chefs dc village. Le decret 96-752 du 05
Septembre 1996 a cree 12 nouvelles communes.
Au terme de cette 6volution, I'ensemble du Sen6gal est couvert par 10
*regions, 60 communes et 320 communaut6s rurales, soit au total 390 collectivites
loccles.
Ces textes s'articulent autour de six principes:
* un statut unique pour toutes les regions qui sont desormais dotees d'un
meme statut juridique et de competences identiques;
, 1'equilibre entre d6centralisation et deconcentration, l'autorite etant
confortee dons sa mission de representant unique de 1'ensemble des
ministeres face aux autontes des collectivites locales de son ressort;
* une meilleure repartition des centres de d6cision afin de les rapprocher
davantage des citoyens;
. un contr6le a posteriori amenage dans le sens de la simplicite. la
rapidite et la proximite, un controle a priori etont maintenu dans huit
domaines dons lesquels la responsabilit6 de l'Etat reste engag6e.
* un controle de legalit6;
* I'unite nationale et lintegrite territoriale reaffirmees, par l'rection de la
region en collectivite locale
* 1'egalite des collectivites locales rendue par la non tutelle d'une
collectivit6 sur une autre.

111. CONTENU DES LOIS DE 1996 ET PERSPECTIVES
Les lois adoptees en 1996 pr6voient des 6volutions dans trois domaines
majeurs: (1) les transferts de competences, (2) les moyens financiers, (3) la mise
en place de structures de pilotage.
3.1. Transferts de competences
La repartition des competences entre l'Etat et les collectivites locales est
guidee par le principe suivant: 6 enjeux locaux. competences locales.
Neuf secteurs feront l'objet de transferts de competences: (1) domaines, (2)
environnement et gestion des ressources naturelles. (3) sante, population et
action sociale, (4) jeunesse, sports et loisirs (5) culture, (6) educafion, (7)
planification, (8) amenagement du territoire, (9) urbanisme et habitat.
La loi fixe les attrbutions dans chaque secteur et pour chaque categorie de
collectivit6 locale. Elle precise que les transferts de competence seront
accompagn6s du  transfert concomitant des moyens et des ressources
necessaires a 1'exercice normal de ces competences.
Le calendrier d'execution de ces transferts de competence sera fixe par loi
de finances et renverra 6 des decrets d'application.
3.2. Les moyens flnanciers
Le developpement de la d6centralisation s'appuie sur les budgets locaux
et sur deux Fonds : le Fonds de Dotation de la D6centralisation (FDD) cree par la
loi n 96-07 et le Fonds d'Equipement des Collectivit6s Locales (FECL).
3.2. 1. Les budgets locaux
Les budgets des collectivites locales continueront 6 etre essentiellement
alimentes par les imrpots locaux et les produits de l'exploitation du domaine et des
services rendus aux tiers. Pour mieux assumer leurs nouvelles responsabilites. des
mesures d'ojustement et de redressement seront prses pour rationaliser la gestion
courante et elaborer des documents de programmation. La mise en oeuvre du
nouveau plan comptable a compter de 1996 a constitue une premiere
contribution a cette orientation.



Annexe I
Page 4/ 7
3.2.2. Le Fonds de Dotation de la Decentralisation (FDD)
Le FDD est institue par la loi n 96-07. Sa vocation est 6 la fois d'assurer une
compensation des transferts de comp6tences et une p6r6quation financiere
entre les collectivites locales. Apres deux ans de transition, il recevra une dotation
d'un montant equivalent 6 un pourcentage de la TVA perque au profit de l'Etat.
Le montant de cette dotation ne pourra toutefois etre inferieur a un montant
correspondant a un pourcentage des recettes totales de l'Etat, hors emprunt et
aides exterieures. Ces deux pourcentoges seront fixes chaque annee en Loi de
Finances, en fonction de l'evolution des transferts de competences.
Dans le cas ou l'insuffisance des ressources financieres des collectivites
locales compromettrait la r6alisation et l1ex6cution des missions de services
publics, IlEtat pourrait intervenir par l'octroi de dQtations speciales aux collectivites
locales concernees.
La r6portition du FDD fera l'objet d'un arrete conjoint du Ministre charge des
Collectivites locales et du Ministre des Finances, apres-avis du Conseil National de
D6veloppement des Collectivites Locales (CNDCL).
Les beneficiaires du FDD sont les regions, les communes et les
communaut&s rurales. Un prelevement au profit des autorites deconcentrees de
l'Etat sera egalement effectue pour couvrir les prestations assurees par ses
services pour le compte de collectivit6s locales. La loi precise que le FDD sera
r6parti en trois dotations: (1) dotation de compensation pour les charges resultant
du fonctionnement des competences transf6r6es, (2) dotation globale de
fonctionnement pour les regions, (3) dotation globale pour les services exterieurs
de I'Etat.
3.2.3. Fonds d'Equipement des ColIecttvites Locales (FECL)
Le FECL recevra un pourcentage de la TVA dans les memes conditions que
le FDD. 11 est d6sormais reparti chaque annee, entre les regions, par arr&t6
conjoint du Ministre charge des Collectivites locales et du Ministre charge des
Finances. Les Prefets seront charges de repartir les fonds entre les differentes
collectivit6s locales b6neficiaires.
Les modalit6s d'attribution seront rationalisees et privilegieront les
investissements justifies dons un document d'orientation dOment approuve par les
autorites competentes.
Elles tiendront compte des modalites de financement retenues dans les
differents projets d'appui aux collectivites locales.



Annexe I
Page 5 / 7
3.3. Les Structures de pilotage
La mise en oeuvre de la politique de decentralisation releve principalement
du Ministere de l'lnterieur, traditionnellement en charge des collectivites locales.
Differentes structures de pilotage sont amen6es a intervenir dans la conduite de
cette politique (1) I'ARD, (2) les services d6concentres, (3) les organismes de suivi,
(4) I'ADM.
3.3. 1. L'Agence Regionale do Developpement (ARD)
La loi n 96-06 institue, au niveau de chaque region, une Agence R&gionale
de Developpement.
Un decret precise leurs attrbutions qui comprennent notamment : (1)
constitution d'une banque de donnees destinee a faciliter la planification du
d6veloppement des collectivites locales, (2) realisation d'etudes socio-
economiques, (3) 6laboration et harmonisation des differents Plans de
D3veloppement des collectivit6s locales et mise en coherence avec le Plan
National de Developpement 6conomique et social.
Les ARD pourront faire appel aux services deconcentres de l'Etat et au
secteur prive.
3.3.2. Les services deconcentr6s de l'Etat
Les services deconcentres continueront a jouer un r6le imoortant dans le
developpement de la decentralisation. L'appui a ces structures sera renforc6.
3.3.3. Les organismes de suivi
Ces organismes sont composes du Conseil National de Developpement
des Collectivites Locales (CNDCL), du Comite Interminist6riel de l'Administration
Territoriale et du Comite Interministeriel d'Amenagement du Territoire.
Le Conseil National de D6veloppement des Collectivites Locales sera
charge de faire le bilan de la politique de decentralisation et de proposer toute
orientation appropriee. 11 donnera un avis pr6olable sur la r6partition du FDD.
3.3.4. L'Agence de Developpement Municipal
Des 1997, I'Etat cr6era une Agence de Developpement municipal a
caract&re autonome dont la vocation sera d'appuyer l'ensemble des communes.
Ses missions consisteront 6 mettre en oeuvre une politique partenaridae
circonscrite dons des contrats de ville signees entre l'Agence et les communes.

Elle interviendra dans le redressement de toutes les communes du Sen6gal. Elle
sera la principale Agence d'execution du Programme d'Appui aux Communes.
IV. APPORT DU PAC
4.1. Presentation du PAC
Dans la perspective du renforcement de la d6centralisation, I'Etat du
Senegal a promu, avec le soutien de la Banque Mondiale, le Quatrieme Projet
urbain appele "Programme d'Appui aux Communes".
11 vise une meilleure prise en charge du developpement urbain par les
communes. Le PAC s'appuiera sur:
, I'ADM qui a pour r6le d'harmoniser les investissements au niveau
communal:
* les contrats de villes comprenant un Plan de redressement de la gestion
municipale et un programme d'investissements prioritaires.
La mise en place de ces contrats de ville s'accompagnera d'une
harmonisation des financements communaux par un mixage approprin des
dotations du FECL, d'une part, et de nouvelles formes de prets et de subventions
financees sur fonds exterieurs, d'autre part.
L'ex6cution du programme d'investissements prioritaires pourra etre confi6e
notamment 6 I'AGETIP par convention de maetrise d'ouvrage delegue.
L'Agence apportera, par ailleurs, un appui aux reformes: reforme de la
fiscalite locale et adaptation du FECL aux nouvelles regles de financement des
investissements communaux.
4.2. Mesures d'occompagnement
Ces mesures seront de trois ordres:
4.2. 1. La reforme fiscale
L'Etat du Senegal prendra les dispositions necessaires en vue de reformer la
fiscclit6 locale. Une 6tude approfondie permettra de finaliser, dans le courant de
l'annee 1997, le contenu de ces reformes. Trois axes sont, 6 ce jour, prvilegies:



Annexe 1
Page 7 / 7
* Taxe fonciere sur les Propri6t6s Baties et non Baties;
* Taxe d'Habitation;
* Patente tenant compte de la capacites contributive des secteurs
moderne et informel.
4.2.2. Adaptation du FECL
Les nouvelles regles du FECL permettront de financer les contrats de ville.
Une quote-part forfaitaire de 1 milliard de F.CFA par an sera affectee au
minimum a ce financement a compter du d6marrage du Programme.
4.2.3. Mise a disposition des fonds de contrepartie
Tant pour les apports du FECL que pour ceux des communes, des
dispositions garantissant la mise a disposition effective des fonds aupres de
l'institution financiere du Programme seront adopt6es.

Evolution R6cente du Processus de D6centralisation
Cette note porte sur les reformes intervenues depuis le debut de l'annee 1996 en matiere de
decentralisation et sur leur impact sur la preparation du Programme d'Appui aux
Communes.
La r6forme
Le contexte de la decentralisation a connu, depuis le debut de l'annee 1996, des 6volutions
significatives avec l'adoption, le 5 fevrier 1996, de six projets de loi venant modifier le
Code des Collectivites locales: (1) loi portant Code des Collectivites Locales, (2) loi portant
transfert de competences aux r6gions, aux communes et aux communautes rurales, (3) loi
modifiant le Code electoral, (4) loi organique relative a la limitation du cumul des mandats
electoraux et de certaines fonctions, (5) loi fixant l'organisation administrative et financiere
de la commune d'arrondissement et ses rapports avec la Ville, (6) loi modifiant la Loi n 72
02 du ler fevrier 1972 relative a l'organisation de l'Administration territoriale. Un d6cret a
ete signe modifiant le decret n72 636 du 29 mai 1972 relatif aux attributions des chefs de
circonscriptions administratives et des chefs de village.
Ces textes confirment l'ancrage de la decentralisation dans l'organisation administrative et
politique de l'Etat senegalais. Les debats ont principalement porte sur l'6rection des dix
r6gions au statut de collectivite locale, sur le transfert de comp6tences et sur l'allegement-
ddconcentration de la tutelle.
Ces reformes font suite aux lois du 8 octobre 1990 qui consacraient le statut de plein
exercice aux 48 communes urbaines et creaient 11 nouvelles communes.
Elles s'inscrivent dans un calendrier avec l'organisation d'elections municipales et
regionales qui ont eu lieu en novembre 1996. Un caractere d'urgence a 6te donne aux
decrets d' application des lois vot6es en fevrier 1996. La reforme est entr&e en vigueur en
janvier 1997.
Les points marquants A retenir
Les principales innovations contenues dans ce nouveau train de reformes sont:
1. Creation de dix regions erigees en collectivites locales avec Conseils dlus au suffrage
universel,
2. Transformation du statut des communes de l'agglomeration de Dakar par creation d'un
troisieme echelon d'administration avec les communes d'arrondissement: onze a Dakar,
six a Pikine, deux a Rufisque et a Guediawaye. Cette mesure s'accompagne d'un
partage des ressources entre les communes (ou villes) et les communes
d'arrondissement. La CUD serait maintenue dans ses statuts,
3. Transferts de competences de l'Etat aux regions et aux communes dans dix domaines
dont ceux de I'education, de la sante, de la gestion des domaines, de l'urbanisme et de
l'habitat. Ces transferts devraient s'accompagner d'un transfert equivalent des
ressources.



Annexe 2
Page 2/2
4. Confirmation du principe de contr6le a posteriori sur les actes des collectivites locales.
Le contr6le a priori est toutefois maintenu sur sept categories d'actes (au lieu de 26
precedemment): (1) les budgets, (2) les emprunts, (3) les conventions de financement
avec la cooperation internationale ou privee, (4) les marches administratifs superieurs a
un montant fix6 par decret et les contrats de concessions d'une duree superieure A 30
ans, (5) les garanties, les prises de participation et les creations d'etablissements publics
locaux, (6) les affaires domaniales et l'urbanisme, (7) les plans regionaux, communaux
et ruraux de d6veloppement et les plans r6gionaux d'amenagement du territoire.
Ce contr6le sera dorenavant exerce de maniere deconcentr6e par les Prefets (pour les
communes urbaines) et les Gouverneurs (pour les regions); ceux-ci disposeront d'un
mois pour exercer leur contr6le a priori.
Ce controle est qualifie de simple contr6le de legalite par opposition A un contr8le
d'approbation.
5. Creation d'un Fonds de Dotation destin6 A appuyer les services deconcentres de l'Etat et
les collectivites locales dans l'exercice de leurs nouvelles responsabilites. Les criteres de
repartition de ce fonds seraient fixes chaque annee par decret apres avis du Conseil
National de Developpement des Collectivites Locales pr6sid& par le Chef de l'Etat. Sa
r6partition serait operee par arr&6 conjoint du ministre charge des Collectivites locales
et du ministre des Finances. Ce fonds serait alimente par prelevement sur le produit de
la TVA hors taxes sur les operations bancaires et sur les operations douanieres(le taux
reste A fixer); il comprendrait deux parts: une part compensation des transferts de
competences et une part perequation.
6. Revision du fonctionnement du FECL: A partir de 1997, le FECL serait alimente par
pr6l6vement sur le produit de la TVA hors taxes sur les operations bancaires et sur les
operations douanieres. Sa repartition entre les communes serait effectu&e par les
Gouverneurs, apres avis des Conseils regionaux. Les enveloppes regionales seraient
attribuees par arte&  conjoint du ministre des finances et du ministre charge des
collectivites locales, comme cela est dejA pratique pour la region de Dakar.
7. Confirmation mais clarification du principe des avances de tresorerie aux communes:
I'article 255 du nouveau code stipule explicitement que I'Etat peut consentir des
avances aux collectivites locales sous certaines conditions: (1) leur"situation de caisse
compromet le reglement des depenses indispensables et urgentes", (2) cette "situation
n'est pas due A une insuffisance des ressources ou A un d6sequilibre budgetaire."
8. Reaffirmation de l'obligation faite aux communes (ordonnateur) et au Tresor
(comptable) de produire respectivement les comptes administratifs, et les situations
comptables mensuelles et les comptes de gestion.
9. Cumul des mandats: les fonctions de maire et de president du Conseil regional sont
incompatibles de m8me que celles de ministre et de president du conseil regional. Nul
ne peut exercer plus de deux mandats electifs.

Situation Financiere des Communes du Senegal
Les tendances 1996
La base de donnees tenue a jour par I'Unite de Projet comprend dorenavant les donnees 1996
actualisees de l'ensemble des 48 communes. Celles afferentes aux 12 nouvelles communes
secondaires ainsi qu'aux 43 communes d'arrondissement cr6ees par les lois de 1996 ne seront
disponibles qu'en fin d'annee 1997, ces collectivites ayant vote leur premier budget cette
annee.
Les quatre tableaux figurant ci apres comprennent les donnees suivantes
* tableau 1: situation des recettes ordinaires en 1994 - 1995 - 1996; il s'agit de recettes
r6alisees (encaissees)
* tableau 2: evolution des recettes ordinaires sur les trois demiers exercices
* tableau 3: capacite d'epargne des communes; cette capacit6 d'epargne est calculee hors
FECL.
* tableau 4: repartition du FECL par commune pour les trois dernieres annees.
Les principales tendances sont les suivantes:
1. les recettes ordinaires des communes depassent 18 milliards de Fcfa en 1996 et connaissent
une evolution de 7,4% par rapport a 1995, soit cinq points environ au-dessus de l'inflation,
2. une progression de pres de 30% avait ete enregistree en 1995, principalement alimentee par
l'amelioration des recouvrements sur les deux communes de Dakar et de Pikine mais
egalement de la plupart des autres facteurs: (1) amelioration generale de la situation de
tresorerie de l'Etat depuis 1995, (2) mesures post-devaluation en matiere d'augmentation
des tarifs, (3) effort de recouvrement des services deconcentres et des communes elles-
m8mes un an avant les elections municipales, (4) mise en place par le Tr6sor de plans de
redressement sur les communes de l'agglomeration de Dakar.
3. Les communes de la region de Dakar concentrent 71% des recettes ordinaires totales des
communes du Sen6gal pour 53% de la population; cette situation structurelle ne connait pas
d'evolution particuliere sur les trois ans etudi6s,
4. La ville de Dakar concentre A elle seule 55% des recettes ordinaires totales du secteur
local; sa population represente 22% de l'ensemble de la population communale,
5. Les 25 communes de moins de 20.000 habitants concentrent mois de 3% des recettes
ordinaires de l'ensemble des communes,
6. L'6cart des recettes par habitant va de moins de 400 Fcfa (Thionk-Essyl, 7.500 habitants) a
10.500 Fcfa (Dakar, 825.000 habitants), soit un ecart de 1 A 25,
7. La capacite d'epargne (recettes ordinaires totales moins depenses de gestion) a
consid6rablement augmente en trois ans: negative en 1994, elle s'eleve A 2,3 milliards de
Fcfa en 1996 soit l'equivalent de 15% des recettes ordinaires,
8. La situation de Dakar et de Pikine influe de maniere tres importante sur cette evolution;
toutefois a l'inverse des resultats relatifs aux recettes, la capacite d'epargne reste aliment6e
de maniere significative par les communes hors region de Dakar,
9. Les resultats de la repartition du FECL sur les trois derniers exercices montrent que cet
instrument financier sert surtout les villes secondaires: 80% des credits reserves aux
communes vont aux communes de moins de 20.000 habitants ; ainsi, ramene au nombre



Annexe 3
Page 2 / 8
d'habitants, c'est la commune de Foundiougne qui a obtenu sur trois ans la dotation
d'investissement la plus elevee (5.117 Fcfa), Dakar obtenant 61 Fcfa par habitant.
10. A 1'exception de Dakar et de Pikine, les dotations du FECL representent des sommes tres
significatives par rapport aux recettes ordinaires des communes, les montants de dotation
pouvant depasser les recettes propres des communes.
Synthese
Capacite definancement et dpargne
On retiendra de ces differents points une evolution relativement prometteuse des ressources
courantes des communes senegalaises au cours des trois dernieres annees. Cette augmentation
n'a pas ete neutralisee par une augmentation proportionnelle des depenses de gestion, mais a
permis aux communes de degager une capacite d'autofinancement significative.
Cette capacite d'autofmancement reste toutefois structurellement fragile; les communes
continuent pour la plupart a ne pas honorer les factures SDE et SENELEC afferentes a leur
consommation d'eau et d'electricite. Un reglement a e  progressivement trouve pour l'eau
avec la delegation syst6matique de la gestion des bornes-fontaines a des prives; les
apurements successifs autorises par i'Etat ont contribue a une certaine deresponsabilisation des
communes; la privatisation annoncee de la SENELEC pourrait toutefois modifier cette
situation.
Le FECL
Les r6sultats de la repartition du FECL, qui constitue le principal transfert financier de l'Etat
aux communes meritent d'etre reexamines. Une meilleure adequation entre les priorites du
d6veloppement urbain et municipal et la r6partition du FECL sera recherchee dans le cadre du
PAC. Le Ministere des Finances et la DCL ont manifeste leur accord pour une mise a plat du
mecanisme general de repartition.
On notera par ailleurs que l'indexation du FECL sur la TVA prevue par les lois de
d6centralisation a ete differde; de meme, le transfert de la repartition de ce fonds au niveau des
Gouvemeurs de Region a lui-meme ete differe, la DCL au Ministere de l'Interieur restant
responsable de cette repartition pour deux ans encore.
La reforme institutionnelle de Dakar
Les donnees dtudides nWint6grent pas les effets de l'evolution institutionnelle sur Dakar et son
agglomeration. La creation de 43 communes d'arrondissements dont 19 sur la seule ville de
Dakar et la disparition probable de la Communaute Urbaine sont amendes a avoir des
incidences importantes sur les dquilibres financiers.
Le transfert aux communes d'arrondissement de recettes jusque la revenant aux villes va
fragiliser la situation des six villes de l'agglomeration sans pour autant apporter de reponse
pertinente aux problemes de gestion urbaine que rencontre cette agglomeration. Ce transfert
entraine parallelement la disparition de la structure d'agglomeration que constituait la CUD et
met en peril le financement ddja fragile du service de ramassage des ordures mdnageres. Plus
largement, on retiendra la relative confusion qui caracterise la mise en oeuvre de cette reforme
de la ville de Dakar. Par rapport au PAC, il a ete recommande de rendre les seules ville
signataires des contrats de ville, les communes d'arrondissement ayant un r6le consultatif pour
la validation du programme d'investissements prioritaires.

Modalit6s du financement des investissements:
principes, base des calculs et evaluation des enveloppes par commune
L. Principes generaux du financement : PAC1 et PAC 2
Ils reposent sur les 4 principes suivants:
- eligibilite
- financement conditionne a la signature d'un contrat de ville,
- harmonisation des guichets de financement
- repartition entre communes sur criteres objectifs.
A) Eligibilite
Toutes les communes urbaines du Senegal sont eligibles sauf les communes n'ayant pas rempli
leurs obligations envers le Credit communal.
B) Contrats de ville
Les contrats de ville comprennent
- des engagements de redressement communal adaptes a la situation des communes, apres
r6alisation d'un audit urbain et d'un audit financier et organisationnel,
- un programme d'investissement.
C) Harmonisation des financements
L'harmonisation s'exprime par l'acces pour chaque commune
- A un mode de financement tres favorable, appele PAC1, equivalent A celui du projet
AGETIP2 (90% de subvention et 10% de contrepartie, financee par une quote-part du
FECL)
- et a un mode de financement complementaire attractif, appele PAC2 (70% de subvention,
20% de pr8t, et 10% de contrepartie communale).
Les pr8ts du PAC2 sont proposes avec un taux de 4,25% sur 12 ans. Ils sont remboursables par
mensualite.
Une troisieme categorie de financement denommee PAC3, reservee aux communautes rurales
et dont l'agence d'execution est l'AGETIP, est comparable au PAC1 (90% de subvention et
10% de contrepartie, financee par une quote-part du FECL).
Par ailleurs:
- le Cr6dit Communal sera restructure: adaptation des pr8ts consentis dans le cadre du
CCC aux nouvelles conditions, utilisation des fonds disponibles en complement du PAC;
- et de son c6te, le FECL fera l'objet d'une 6tudel destinee a preciser son avenir.
Ainsi, il s'agit autant que possible de:
- limiter au maximum la concurrence entre modes de financement,
- prendre en compte la faible capacite financiere des communes (difficultes A autofinancer
les investissements, ou a supporter un recours massif A l'emprunt),
- remedier a l'impossibilite de mobiliser des montants important A date fixe pour des
remboursements d'annuite ou d'autofinancement m8me r6duit en proportion.
financ&e par l'ACDI en complement de l'etude fiscale.

II. Repartition globale des financements
Elle est calcul6e sur la base d'un credit IDA de 75 millions US$, dont
- 15 millions US$ pour le PAC 3, reserves aux communautes rurales,
- 10 millions US$ destines au fonctionnement de l'ADM et au programme d'appui aux
communes,
- 50 millions US$ destines au PACI et PAC2, soit une enveloppe A repartir de 30 milliards
de Fcfa (au taux de 1 US$ = 600 Fcfa)
A) Determination des criteres de repartition
Diverses simulations ont ete effectuees afin de determiner les parts respectives de chaque
mode de financement et les criteres de determination de l'enveloppe par commune:
- pour le PAC1, plusieurs niveaux du plancher d'investissement destines A prendre en
compte la situation des nouvelles communes,
- pour le PAC2, test de sensibilite de plusieurs ratios de capacite de remboursement,
- enfin parts relatives du PAC 1 et du PAC2 sous les contraintes prec6dentes.
Finalement, les criteres suivants ont ete retenus:
- une repartition des 30 milliards de Fcfa A raison de 50 % pour le PAC 1, soit 15 milliards
de Fcfa, et 50 % pour le PAC 2, soit 15 milliards de Fcfa, solution equilibrde qui exprime
(apres v6rification et simulations) que le PAC doit accorder autant d'importance aux
besoins des nouvelles communes, qu'aux communes anciennes satisfaisant aux criteres
de gestion des contrat de ville.
- pour le PACI, un plancher de 75 millions de Fcfa par commune eligible, ce qui doit
permettre aux nouvelles communes de se doter d'un minimum d'equipement, expression
concrete de la politique de decentralisation du gouvernement du Senegal.
- pour le PAC2, une evaluation des enveloppes communales calculees a partir d'un ratio de
6% des recettes mensuelles ordinaires;
B) Mode de calcul pour une commune
Pour chaque commune, on calculera sa dotation PAC A partir des deux sous dotations PAC 1 et
PAC2:
- la sous dotation PACI est calculee A partir d'une dotation par habitantde 3 550 Fcfa avec
un plancher de financement de 75 millions de Fcfa par commune.
- la sous-dotation PAC2 repose sur une capacite de paiement d'une mensualite selon les
conditions suivantes:
o la mensualite maximale ne doit pas depasser 6 % des recettes moyennes mensuelles
(reference du compte de gestion de 1996)
o le montant de la dotation est obtenu A partir de la mensualitd maximale A raison de 10
millions de Fcfa d'investissement par tranche de mensualite unitaire de 28 000 Fcfa,
o la dotation est soumise A un plafond de 4 900 Fcfa par habitant.
C) Exemple de calcul
Le calcul qui suit concerne la ville de Ziguinchor.
Pour le PACI, on multiplie la dotation par habitant de 3 350 Fcfa par la population, 178 776
habitants et on obtient 634,6 millions de Fcfa. Cette somme etant superieure au plancher (75
millions de Fcfa), le plancher ne s'applique pas.



Annexe 5
Page 3 / 5
Pour le PAC2, on observe que le montant des recettes annuelles au compte de gestion de 1996,
est de 395 millions de Fcfa. Les recettes mensuelles moyennes sont donc de 395 / 12 = 33
millions de Fcfa.
La mensualite maximale est de 6% de la recette moyenne mensuelle, soit 6% x 33 millions de
Fcfa = 2 millions de Fcfa.
A raison de 10 millions de Fcfa d'investissement par tranche de 28 000 Fcfa, on obtient le
montant du PAC2:
10 millions x 2 000 000 / 28 000 = 705 millions de Fcfa
Au total le PAC de Ziguinchor s'616ve A 634 + 705 = 1 339 millions de Fcfa.
On observe que la regle du plafond ne s'applique pas dans le PAC2, le ratio par habitant du
PAC2 pour Ziguinchor est de 3 944 Fcfa par habitant pour un plafond de 4 900 Fcfa.
D) Caracteristiques des financements:
Les structures du financement (par combinaison de PAC1 et 2) sont en g6neral de 85%
subvention, 10% emprunt et 5% autofinancement. Mais les nouvelles communes dont la
capacite de financement est insuffisante n'ont acces qu'au PAC 1 et sont donc financees a 100%
par apport exterieur (IDA et FECL).
D'un point de vue g6ographique, 50 % des financements (PAC 1 et PAC2) sont affectes aux
communes de la communaute urbaine de Dakar qui representent 52% de la population urbaine
du Senegal, les 50% restant a l'ensemble des communes de l'int6rieur. La ville de Dakar
disposerait d'environ 23 % des financements.

Circuits de Financement
L'execution du Programme d'Appui aux Communes s'articule autour de contrats de ville
signes entre I'ADM et les communes beneficiaires et comporte deux composantes: un Plan
d'Ajustement Municipal (PAM) et un Programme d'1nvestistaments Prioritaires (PIP).
L'evaluation des projets d'investissement et l'accord de financement qui en decoule, sont du
ressort exclusif de l'ADM.
Le programme d'investissement prioritaire est fixe au terme de deux audits (urbain et
financier) qui auront permis sa justification en termes notamment de priorite et de faisabilite
financiere.
Dans le cadre du programme d'investissement, deux modes de financement sont prevus:
 le PAC 1 : 11 s'agit d'un mode de financement a des conditions tres souples. Ce
programme ne repond pas A des criteres financiers particuliers puisqutil s'adresse a
toutes les communes sur une base relativement egalitaire et ne fait appel ni a un
autofinancement des communes bendficiaires ni a des credits; il est - du point de vue
des communes bendficiaires - completement subventionne.
 le PAC 2: ce deuxieme mode de financement aux conditions moderees renvoie
principalement a la capacite des communes a honorer leur part d'autofinancement et leur
capacite future A rembourser les credits generes (le schema de financement dtant 70%
de subventions, 20% de credit et 10% d'autofinancement). Ce premier mode devient
obligatoire (pour une partie du PIP) des lors que les communes concernees presentent
des conditions favorables d'acces.
On peut rappeler egalement que:
 La signature d'un contrat de ville (comportant soit l'un des deux modes de financement
ou les deux en meme temps) entre l'ADM et la commune bendficiaire comporte I'accord
de financement par l'ADM d'un certain nombre de projets nommement designes.
L'ensemble de ces projets constitue le Programme d'investissement prioritaire ( PIP)
dont le montant est indique dans le contrat de ville et pour lesquels les montants
respectifs de subventions, credits (eventuellement) et autofinancement (dventuellement)
ainsi que l'echeancier prdvisionnel de realisation sont autant d'elements precises;
* L'execution de ces projets selon le mode de maitrise d'ouvrage deleguee est confiee par
le beneficiaire A un maitre d'Ouvrage Delegue (MOD).
* Aussi bien la contrepartie des communes (au titre de l'autofinancement propre exige
dans certains contrats) que les remboursements ulterieurs des communes (au titre des
credits qu'elles auront contractes), donnent lieu A des flux fnanciers emanant des
communes selon une formule de mensualites.
* Parallelement a l'execution des projets d'investissement, un programme d'appui
institutionnel est mis en oeuvre, les beneficiaires etant soit les communes soit d'autres
institutions. L'execution financiere de ce programme est confiee A l'ADM.
Aussi et dans ces conditions, les circuits de financement et de circulation des fonds peuvent etre
explicites comme suit:

11 s'agit de:
* B.F. Extdrieurs:
L'IDA apportera ses financements pour
* les programmes d'investissement (avec les deux modes de financement) dans des
proportions et volumes qui seront precises dans le tableau de financement global
du projet.
* le financement du programme d'appui institutionnel.
* le financement des depenses de fonctionnement de I'ADM sur la periode du projet.
D'autres bailleurs de fonds ont exprime leur inter8t a participer au PAC sous forme
de financement parallele (i.e. CFD 10 millions dollars)

Apportera son concours essentiellement par le biais de deux mecanismes:
 une quote part sur le FECL pour abonder les fonds destines aux PIP; 1 milliard Fcfa
pour PACI et PAC2 par an, plus 200 milliards Fcfa pour PAC3
 le reliquat des disponibilites du Compte de Credit Communal A la date demise en
vigueur du projet (d6duction faite de tous les engagements contractualises par cet
instrument et des besoins necessaires A la restructuration de la dette constituee).
* Les communes
Pour celles qui b6neficient du PAC 2, elles apporteront leur concours par des
mensualites correspondant a leur part d'autofinancement et (ult6rieurement) des
mensualites correspondant au remboursement des credits contractes.
b. Autres intervenants principaux
II s'agit de:
* I'ADM, Agence d'execution du Projet ( PAC 1 et PAC 2): dont le role principal
est la gestion des contrats de ville (apres contractualisation avec les communes), le
financement des projets du PIP ( dont l'execution revient aux MOD) et la gestion
directe des composantes d'appui institutionnel.
* le MOD dont le rOle principal est la maitrise d'ouvrage deleguee pour le compte des
communes en vue de la realisation de la composante investissement des contrats de
ville.
2. Le circuit des fonds
a Les fonds destines au financement de l'appui institutionnel et le fonctionnement de
lADM
L'ADM, au fur et mesure de l'execution, procedera au tirage - sur le Compte special
du Projet- des montants requis.
L'alimentation du Compte special du Projet - au titre de cette composante - se fait
selon les proc6dures habituelles i.e.;
* une avance calcul6e en fonction du volume previsionnel sur une periode de 4
mois.
* des alimentations successives justifiees par le niveau de d6caissements.



Annexe 6
Page 3 /6
b. Les fonds destines au financement des investissements( PIP) et mobilises aupres de
l 'IDA
Tout en rappelant
* que le "decideur" en matiere d'engagement est I'ADM (lors de la signature des
contrats de ville)
* que c'est le Maitre d'ouvrage delegue - le MOD - qui en est l'utilisateur.
* que ces fonds couvrent - lors de leur utilisation - les deux modes de financement
mentionnes plus haut ( PAC 1 et PAC2) et servent donc de ce fait a financer les
subventions ainsi que le credit.
On suivra le dispositif suivant:
* L'ADM, au fur et A mesure de l'execution des contrats de ville, procedera A des
appels de fonds aupres de l'IDA en vue d'alimenter le Compte sp6cial. Et a partir
de ce compte, elle ordonne les virements en faveur du MOD dont la domiciliation
se trouve Aupres d'une ou plusieurs Banques. Cependant, nombre de regles seront
observees:
 Le MOD beneficie d'une avance de demarrage egale a 20% du volume
previsionnel d'activites ( sauf accord particulier) tel qu'il ressort des devis-
programmes executoires ( pour lesquels des conventions de maitrise d'ouvrage
deleguees ont ete signees avec les communes beneficiaires). Pour les
decaissements ulterieurs, une justification de consommation des fonds sera
requise.
 Lors des appels de fonds aupres de I'ADM, la justification de consommation de
fonds detaillera en particulier les utilisations par commune et par projet ainsi
que le poste de remun6ration du MOD.
En amont - et quant a l'alimentation du Compte special du Projet au titre de cette
composante - les procedures habituelles seront appliquees i.e.;
* une avance calculee en fonction du volume d'activit6s( inherentes a cette
composante) prdvisionnel sur une periode de 4 mois.
* des alimentations ulterieures justifiees par le niveau de consommation realise
(on remarquera dans ce cas que la justification de consommation du ( des)
MOD foumira les 6l6ments de base).
* L'ADM, au fur et mesure des virements effectues en faveur du ( des ) MOD tient
une comptabilite des decaissements par commune precisant notamment les
montants et dates de mise a disposition des credits de maniere A produire
ulterieurement les tableaux definitifs d'amortissement.
c. Les fonds provenant de l'Etat:
Ces fonds - en principe composes d'une quote part FECL et du solde disponible du
CCC - sont mis a disposition annuellement par l'Etat (cas du FECL) et en principe en
une seule fois pour le cas du CCC.
La quote part de FECL allouee aux PAC1 et PAC 2 sera mise A disposition de
l'ADM sur un compte au Trdsor detenu par cette dernire.
Selon des regles similaires A ce qui a ete explicite plus haut ( Cf. b sur les procedures
enclenchant l'alimentation du MOD), I'ADM ordonne des virements en faveur du
MOD ( qui dispose d'un compte au tresor);



Annexe 6
Page 4/ 6
Quant au reliquat du CCC alloue au PAC, il sera mis A la disposition de l'ADM dans
un compte aupres d'une Institution financiere. Selon les memes regles de
decaissement, I'ADM ordonnera progressivement des virements en faveur du MOD.
d Lesfonds des communes:
Les mensualites correspondant A l'autofinancement des communes sont versees par la
commune sur le compte au Tresor de I'ADM. Ces fonds seront transferes ensuite par
celle-ci au MOD ( qui dispose d'un compte au tresor)selon les memes regles de
d6caissement explicitees plus haut.
Quant aux mensualites de remboursement, elles seront versees par les communes sur
le compte au Tresor de l'ADM. Ces fonds, qui seront disponibles en cours
d'execution du projet, seront g6res par I'ADM et leur utilisation se fera pour
abonder une deuxieme tranche du PAC. Les memes dispositions sont prevues quant
au remboursement et la reutilisation des fonds provenant des remboursements des
prets anterieurs accordes par le CCC et dont la gestion est d6sormais confi6e A
I'ADM.

Credit aux Communes
Fermeture du CCC
Le recours au credit pour le financement des investissements communaux, inaugure dans le 3e
projet urbain avec le Credit Communal, devient quasi-systematique dans le PAC, avec le mode
de financement PAC2 (70% de subvention, 10% de contrepartie communale et 20%
d'emprunt). Seules, les communes nouvellement crdees ou quelques communes A la surface
financiere tres etroite voient le financement de leur PIP limite au PAC 1 (90% de subvention et
10% de contrepartie FECL).
Le Credit communal etait base sur des conditions financieres qui ne sont plus aujourd'hui
compatibles avec celles proposees dans le PAC. Il est donc propose d'harmoniser par exemple
le taux d'intdr&t, et de reprendre les encours du Crddit communal ainsi que les fonds
disponibles non-engages. Au total, la gestion de cet encours, auquel s'ajoutera le nouvel
encours du PAC contribuera aux ressources permanentes de l'ADM qui doit d6s la 4e ann6e
financer 20% de son budget. Enfin I'avenir du PAC repose sur une securisation du versement
de l'autofinancement des communes et le remboursement de leurs prets. Ces trois points (i)
Credit communal, (ii) recyclage des credits aux communes, et (iii) sdcurisation par
mensualisation sont presentes ci-dessous.
A. LE TRAITEMENT DES PRETS DU CREDIT COMMUNAL
Les conditions financieres du Credit communal se sont trouvees concurrencees par d'autres
guichets, pratiquement des son ouverture. Aujourd'hui, ses conditions de pr6ts apparaissent
comme peu realistes (taux d'inter& de 6% sur une duree de 7 ans), surtout compte tenu du
demarrage du PAC qui s'appuie sur des pr8ts A 4,25% sur 12 ans.
Ceci pose 2 problemes
- la restructuration des pr8ts accordes,
- l'utilisation des financements disponibles.
10 la restructuration des prets accord6s
La restructuration des pr8ts du Crddit communal retiendra les conditions de taux d'interet du
PAC2 soit 4,25%:
- pour les communes a jour de leur remboursement, le capital restant dui sera reconverti
en un pret A 4,25% sur une duree de 10 ans, payable par mensualite;
- pour les communes n'ayant pas regle tout leurs remboursements, le capital restant do,
y compris les annuites impayees (inter8t + capital) sera reconverti en un prt A 4,75%
pour une duree de 10 ans payable par mensualite ; rappelons que ces communes ne
sont pas eligibles au PAC tant qu'elles n'ont pas regularise leur situation.
Le versement des mensualites sera effectue sur le compte de l'ADM au Tresor. Les obligations
d'inscriptions budgetaires et les responsabilites de l'Administration seront equivalentes a celles
prevues pour le PAC
2 I'utilisation des financements disponibles.
Les financements non utilisds et disponibles seront verses au compte de l'ADM dans une
institution financiere. Ces financements comprennent:
- les sommes libres de tout engagement,



Annexe 7
Page 2 / 5
- les engagements n'ayant pas fait l'objet d'une signature effective d'un contrat de pret,
et qui ne seront pas concr6tis6s (environ 1 milliard).
B. LE RECYCLAGE DES CREDITS AUX COMMUNES
Les futurs remboursements de pret formeront une dotation en capital. A terme, cette dotation
destinee au recyclage des cr6dits representera un montant d'environ 5 milliards de Fcfa.
Pour la part interet des emprunts, l'encours des pr8ts initiaux (PAC + Credit communal) aura
atteint son maximum a la fin de la 3e annee et atteindra donc environ 5 milliards de Fcfa. Cet
encours generera une remuneration de 212 millions de Fcfa. II est donc envisage qu'au cours
de la 5eme annee de l'ADM, 20% des frais de fonctionnement de l'ADM seront couverts par
les ressources des fonds de recyclage.
C. SECURISATION PAR MENSUALISATION DES VERSEMENTS COMMUNAUX
Dans le cadre du contrat de ville, les communes contribuent au financement des
investissements par leur autofinancement (contrepartie) et le remboursement des emprunts
necessaires.
Afin de resoudre la difficulte de mobiliser en une seule fois I'autofinancement ou des
remboursements d'annuite, le principe general est le recours a une mensualite qui comprend a
la fois 1Peffort de contrepartie de la commune et le remboursement de la dette, lorsque celle-ci a
6t6 contractee.
La mensualite est exigible des le premier mois suivant la signature du contrat de ville. Le
montant cumuli des mensualites qui precede les depenses formne l'autofinancement de la
commune. Par la suite, en fonction des tirages de pr8t, la mensualit6 est peu a peu consacr6e
entiWrement aux remboursements d'emprunt. II s'agit donc d'une forme d'epargne-
investissement proche de I'pargne logement.
Le montant de la mensualite est calculi en fonction d'un echeancier previsionnel du programme
d'investissement communal, lui m8me dimensionn6
- en fonction d'une capacite globale de financement (PAC 1 et PAC2)
- et des audits urbains et financiers.
La partie PAC2 des financements repose sur les modalites suivantes:
- autofinancement    10%
- subvention        70%
- pr8t PAC2         20%
Les pr8ts du PAC2 sont proposes avec un taux de 4,25% sur 12 ans. lus sont remboursables par
mensualite.
Avec les modalites de financement prevues, le montant de la mensualite est de 280 000 Fefa
pour un programme de 100 millions de Fcfa d'investissement PAC2. Ce montant a dte
determine de telle facon que pour 100 millions de Fcfa d'investissement:
- il soit superieur au remboursement de pr8ts effectivement mobilis6 (soit pour un
maximum de 20 millions de Fcfa, un remboursement mensuel de 178 000 Fcfa),
- que l'autofinancement degage, environ 100 000 Fcfa par mois dans la p6riode de
financement, permette d'atteindre l'objectif d'une contrepartie communale de 10%.



Annexe 7
Page 3 / 5
La mensualite definit les limites des programmes d'investissements
L'objectif est d'adapter la mensualit6 aux capacites financieres et de tresorerie des communes.
II est raisonnable de limiter la mensualite A 6 % des recettes moyennes mensuelles ordinaires.
Ainsi,
- pour une commune dont les recettes r6elles de fonctionnement sont de 120 millions
de Fcfa,
- et les recettes mensuelles moyennes de 10 millions de Fcfa,
- 1'effet du financement du PAC2 ne doit pas exceder 6% de 10 millions de Fcfa, soit
0,6 millions de Fcfa.
Cette proportion induit de fait une limite au recours aux financement du PAC2. En effet,
chaque fraction de 100 millions de Fcfa d'investissement repr6sentera une d6pense mensuelle
de 280 000 Fcfa. Dans le cas precedent le programme d'investissement sera limite a
100 millions de Fcfa x 600 000 Fcfa /280 000 Fcfa = 214 millions de Fcfa
Cette limite forme un premier plafond, chaque commune pouvant d6cider de retenir un
programme d'investissement inf6rieur (200 millions de Fcfa par exemple). II existe un second
plafond qui n'interesse que quelques villes: le PAC 2 ne doit pas apporter des ressources
sup6rieures A 4 900 Fcfa par habitant.
Rappelons que le PAC 2 vient s'ajouter au PAC 1 (3 550 F/habitant), avec un plancher de 75
millions de Fcfa minimum par commune urbaine.
Interpr6tation financiire de la mensualite
La mensualit6 correspond a une capacite d'epargne brute mensuelle (cash-flow brut) destin6e
selon les cas:
- a effectuer de I'autofinancement (contrepartie communale)
- ou a rembourser les emprunts contract6s (tant pour les int6rets - ou frais financiers -
que pour le remboursement du capital)
L'autofinancement ne peut 8tre effectue que prealablement (6pargne prealable) ou en meme
temps que la depense.
Les mensualit6s d'emprunts dependent des montants effectivement emprunt6s.
En bonne gestion financiere, les communes, en fonction des decaissements a operer vont
utiliser
- d'abord leur autofinancement pr6alable,
- puis les ressources de subvention qui leur sont accordees
- enfin, mais plus tardivement, les emprunts.
Ceci est illustre dans le graphique suivant, correspondant au tableau d'amortissement propose
en annexe a cette note.

La mensualite ne peut 8tre fixe et doit s'adapter A ces contraintes. Elle comprendra
g6n6ralement 3 phases
- phase 1: il n'y a pas de decaissement, la commune accumule une capacite
d'autofinancement; le montant de la mensualit6 est A son maximum: 280 000 Fcfa
pour 100 millions de Fcfa de d6penses financees par le PAC21
- phase 2:
* premiers d6caissements, la commune utilise I'autofinancement accumule et
complete avec la dotation de subvention;
* selon le cas, un emprunt complementaire est necessaire ou pas;
* si c'est le cas, le remboursement mensuel de l'emprunt est calcule ainsi que le
tableau d'amortissement distinguant les frais financiers et le remboursement du
capital.
- phase 3:
* apres le premier emprunt, la commune continue A payer une mensualite maximum
(280 000 Fcfa par 100 millions de Fcfa) dont une partie represente le
remboursement mensuel de l'emprunt (100 000 Fcfa par exemple) et le
complement est I'autofinancement disponible (180 000 Fcfa, par exemple).
- phase 4:
* pour de nouveaux decaissements, la commune utilise I'autofinancement accumule,
complete avec la dotation de subvention;
* elle emprunte a nouveau, ce qui genere un nouveau remboursement mensuel de
l'emprunt auquel on associe un nouveau tableau d'amortissement distinguant les
frais financiers et le remboursement du capital.
- phase 5:
* Ia commune continue A payer une mensualitd maximum (280 000 Fcfa par 100
millions de Fcfa) tant qu`il reste des decaissement A effectuer et des emprunts a
contracter
- phase 6:
* Iorsqu'il n'y a plus de decaissements A effectuer,
* I'autofinancement n'est plus necessaire;
'Rappelons que les financements ne sont pas individualises par equipement, et que le programme
communal cumule les financement PACI et PAC2. La distinction ne sert qu'A mesure le capacite
financiere de la commune et sa dotation globale.

Le remboursement d'emprunt est calcul6 selon le principe d'un versement constant tout au long
de la duree prevue, soit pour 12 ans, sur 144 mensualites, avec un taux d'int6ret de 4,25 %.
Le graphique ci-dessous montre mois par mois le contenu de la mensualite et son 6volution tout
au long du processus.

La solution preconisee est n6anmoins, par souci de simplification de retenir une mensualit6
constante. Les diverses simulations effectu6es montrent que le montant de 280 000 Fcfa pour
100 millions de Fcfa de travaux couvre la plupart des situations.
En revanche, en comptabilite, il sera necessaire de bien identifier les montants qui
correspondent a l'autofinancement et au remboursement d'emprunt. Ceci est pr6cis6 dans la
convention de financement.

Convention Tripartite
entre l'Etat du S&nigal, l'Association des Maires du Senegal (AMS) et
l'Agence de D6veloppement Municipal (ADM)
Preambule
Le gouvernement de la Republique du Senegal dans le cadre de sa politique de
decentralisation entend realiser avec le concours de I'Association Intemationale   pour le
D6veloppement (IDA) et en liaison etroite avec l'Association des Maires du Senegal (AMS), un
Programme d'Appui aux Communes qui se fixe les objectifs suivants:
- Mettre les communes dans les conditions optimales leur permettant de mieux gerer le
developpement local, A travers une serie de r6forrnes institutionnelles;
- Contribuer a la clarification des engagements reciproques de l'Etat et des communes a
travers la definition d'un cadre juridique global;
- Mettre en oeuvre un appui institutionnel aux communes en vue du renforcement du r6le et
de la responsabilite des autorit6s locales;
- Assainir la situation financiere des communes afin de promouvoir le developpement de leur
capacite d'investissement;
- Financer des investissements coherents fondes sur une justification economique et sociale
des operations et visant a favoriser lPemergence de p6les de d6veloppement economiques;
- Renforcer la capacite de gestion des communes.
La reussite d'un programme de cette envergure postule une demarche fondee sur le
partenariat.
L'atteinte des objectifs susvises depend de l'appui de l'Etat par le biais des directions centrales
de certains ministeres (Direction du Tresor, Direction des Collectivites Locales, Direction de
l'Urbanisme etc.) et des organismes des secteurs bancaire et technique.
De meme, il est clair que toute action visant A accroitre l'autonomie et les pouvoirs des
communes ne saurait donner de resultats probants, si les communes ne s'engagent pas d'abord dans
une revision en profondeur de leurs modes de fonctionnement administratif et financier (recouvrement
des recettes, contr6le des d6penses, recrutement du personnel etc.).
L'effort exig6 des communes necessite, face aux moyens limites de l'Etat, un concours
financier et technique de certains bailleurs de fonds et la creation d'une structure de pilotage et de
gestion dont la flexibilite et l'autonomie pourraient garantir la prise en compte de la complexite des
operations envisagees.
Reconnaissant l'interet majeur que presente cet organisme, I'Etat lui conferera toute
l'assistance administrative et financiere ainsi que les garanties juridiques et les avantages fiscaux
necessaires a sa creation et A son bon fonctionnement.  La mise en oeuvre du partenariat
6nonce ci-dessus sera d6clin6e dans un contrat de ville qui constitue un moyen destine A faciliter le
redressement municipal, ainsi que le developpement communal dans le cadre d'un projet de ville
formule par l'Etat.
Les parties envisagent leurs relations dans le cadre d'une collaboration etroite de longue durde
en vue d'assurer la reussite de ce programme.

Dans le prolongement de cet appui aux communes et afin d'assurer un developpement
6quilibre entre le milieu urbain et le milieu rural, l'Etat va aussi apporter son concours aux
communautes rurales a travers un programme d'investissements pilotes qui devra preparer les
communautes rurales a assurer une meilleure rationalisation de leurs investissements.
Le PAC comprend ainsi deux (2) volets:
a) un volet destine aux communes et fonctionnant avec deux (2) guichets qui sont le PAC I et
le PAC 2;
b) un volet destine aux communautes rurales denomm6 PAC 3.
Les parties conviennent que leurs relations sont regies par la presente convention ainsi que par

entend r6aliser avec le concours de l'Association Internationale pour le Developpement (IDA) et en
liaison etroite avec l'Association des Maires du Sen6gal (AMS), un Programme d'Appui aux Communes
qui se fixe les objectifs suivants:
- Mettre les communes dans les conditions optimales leur permettant de mieux gerer le
d6veloppement local, a travers une serie de reformes institutionnelles;
- Contribuer a la clarification des engagements reciproques de l'Etat et des communes a travers la
definition d'un cadre juridique global;
- Mettre en oeuvre un appui institutionnel aux communes en vue du renforcement du r6le et de la
responsabilite des autorites locales;
- Assainir la situation financiere des communes afin de promouvoir le developpement de leur
capacite d'investissement;
- Financer des investissements coherents fond6s sur une justification 6conomique et sociale des
operations et visant a favoriser l'emergence de p6les de d6veloppement economiques;
- Renforcer la capacite de gestion des communes.
La reussite d'un programme de cette envergure postule une d6marche fondee sur le partenariat.
L'atteinte des objectifs susvises depend de l'appui de l'Etat par le biais des directions centrales de certains
ministeres (Direction du Tresor et de la Comptabilite Publique, Direction des Collectivites Locales,
Direction de l'Urbanisme etc.) et des organismes des secteurs bancaire et technique.
De m8me, il est clair que toute action visant a accro^itre l'autonomie et les pouvoirs des communes
ne saurait donner de resultats probants, si les communes ne s'engagent pas d'abord dans une revision en
profondeur de leurs modes de fonctionnement administratif et financier (recouvrement des recettes,
contr6le des depenses, recrutement du personnel etc.).
Dans le prolongement de cet appui aux communes afin d'assurer un developpement equilibre
entre le milieu urbain et rural, I'Etat va aussi avec I'appui de l'IDA apporter son concours aux

L 'application d 'un pourcentage pour determiner le cou^t de fonctionnement du maitre d 'ouvrage delegue
sur les travaux qui lui sont confies obeit a plusieurs regles etablies a partir de la pratique de l 'AGETIP'
qui exerce cettefonction depuis 1989.
Le cou^t de fonctionnement de  'A GETIP' a ete fixe a S% en relation avec la Banque Mondiale apres
observation des couts reels de fonctionnement de l'Agence entre 1989 et 1992 mais ce cozit varie
naturellement enfonction de plusieurs parametres
* couit du projet;
* nature de projet;
* duree du projet;
0 eloignement du site;
* typologie des entreprises qui ex&cutent les travaux;
p prise en compte de la dimension creation d 'emplois.
Pour la d6termination du pourcentage, un plancher qui tient compte de la pratique et qui se situe a 3% a
ete defini. En deca, il devient tres aleatoire pour le maitre d 'ouvrage delegue' d 'assurer le recouvrement
de ses couats, etant etendu qu 'il devra maintenir une structure permanente lui permettant de pouvoir faire
face a tout moment a ses obligations. C'est en quelques sorte point d 'equilibre et ce chiffre ne peut etre
atteint que si le volume des travaux executes est relativement important.
La grille qui est proposee en annexe tient compte de toutes ces considerations. Cependant, pour des
raisons de simplicite, seul les parametres les plus determinants ont ite retenus.
1. COUTDUPROJET
Plus ce cout est eleve, plus on peutjouer sur 1 'effet d 'chelle pour amoindrir les couats de fonctionnement.
Le. regroupement de plusieurs projets pouvant sefaire defacon concomitante permet d'arriver au mme
resultat.
Ainsi, 5 (cinq) plages de remuneration ont etdi retenues suivant le volume des travaux. Une relation
lineaire a ete definie entre le volume des projets et la remuneration.
2. NATURE DUPROJET
De nature, certains types de travaux (f entreprises d'egale capacite) sont plus faciles a realiser que
d'autres et ncessitent moins souvent la presence du personnel du maitre d'ouvrage de'ligue. Ainsi,
suivant les travauxfigurant dans le catalogue, deux grands types de travaux ont ete deflnis:
* Ti =       Infrastructures - Projets Environnements
* T2  =      Infrastructures scolaires et de sante - Equipements administratifs -
Equipements socio-collectifs - Equipements marchands - Projet de
protection du patrimoine.

Analyse Economique des Sous-Projets
Principes de base et approche gen6rale
1. L'analyse economique des sous-projets qui seront finances dans le cadre des Contrats de Ville doit
etre un element important de leur justification en plus de nombre d'autres avantages sociaux...
2. On peut rappeler les principes de base d'une etude economique d'un projet:
* II s'agit essentiellement de comparer la situation qui resultera de l'execution du projet A la
situation de reference la plus pertinente et qui est A definir: par exemple une situation ofi l'on ne
fait rien, ou une situation ofi l'on met en oeuvre un projet alternatif.
* Cette comparaison consiste en une evaluation des cofits - avantages economiques entre les deux
situations mentionnees plus haut, evaluation qui permet de degager quelques ratios ou indicateurs
classiques tels que le taux de rentabilite interne (economique) qui devra etre au-dessus d'un
certain seuil pour justifier le projet.
On notera que cet exercice suppose:
* l'identification et le calcul des cofits avantages selon la nature et la specificite du projet. Cela
signifie qu'au moins une etude preliminaire (pre-faisabilite) a ete effectuee pour foumir les
donn6es A prendre en consideration.
* I'etablissement des coefficients permettant le passage des co&its du marche (co&its financiers) aux
couts de reference (couts economiques -"shadow prices"). Cet aspect vient du fait qu'il s'agit,
dans le calcul economique, de considerer les co&ts - avantages pour 1'ensemble de la collectivite
(les flux intemes n'etant pas pris en consideration).
3. Si l'utilite et l'importance de cette approche sont incontoumables, on notera toutefois certaines
limites et difficultes rencontrees fr6quemment:
* pour les petits projets le niveau d'effort (et donc de co&t) pour reunir des donnees precises et
r6alistes devant alimenter le calcul economique sera prohibitif et generateur de delais excessifs.
Les estimations grossieres pour contourner cette difficulte conduiraient A des evaluations
artificielles.
* l'utilisation d'approches plus simplifiees est recommandee compte tenu de la nature de certains
projets et de ce qui est couramment applique pour des projets similaires: et c'est ce que l'on
proposera dans la suite.
Aussi I'approche suivante sera generalement suivie:
* Pour tous les grands projets, c'est A dire un delA d'un co&t de 200 millions Fcfa, 1'elaboration
d'une etude de rentabilit6 6conomique complete;
* Pour le reste des projets, on suivrait une demarche adaptee A la nature des projets:
* Pour les projets d'equipements socio-collectifs, de sante, education ou a caractere fortement
environnemental (assainissement liquide ou solide), on s'appuiera sur une justification en
termes de co&ts/efficacite. Dans cette optique, le projet est A priori eligible car appartenant A un
secteur d'intervention prioritaire; il s'agira surtout qu'il constitue la meilleure solution c'est a
dire celle qui repond au mieux aux besoins avec le moindre cout. On trouvera, a titre
d'illustration, une fiche de justification economique pour un projet de construction d'un poste
de sante.
* Pour les projets d'infrastructures voiries urbaines, on developpera une methode A adopter et qui
sera illustre par deux exemples,
* Pour les projets marchands, on etablira les indicateurs financiers du projet: taux de rentabilite
inteme financier, tableau de tresorerie ...Un exemple de justification financiere est pr6sente.

Projet d'Equipement Socio-Collectif: Construction d'un Poste De Sante a Kaftine
Justification Economique
1. Le projet
Il s'agit d'un projet identifi6 au "Programme d'Investissements Prioritaires" dans le cadre du
"contrat de ville pilote" de Kaffrine.
2. Situation actuelle des equipements sanitaires et population desservie
Actuellement, seul un centre de sante est implante A Kaffrine. Ce centre pourvoie aux soins
primaires de 1'ensemble de la population de Kaffrine (22 000 Hab. et de son Departement
170 000 Hab.) Aussi, la saturation de cet 6quipement est manifeste et se traduit par un
encadrement sanitaire en deca du minimum requis.
En outre, le centre actuel etant vetuste et de conception non adaptee, sa seule rehabilitation ne
permettra pas de repondre aux besoins exprimes.
3. Appreciation de la demande future
* Selon la grille du Ministere de la Sante, un centre de sante est requis pour une population
de 20 000 Hab. alors que le seuil d'apparition d'un poste de sante est de 10000 Hab.
* La population actuelle de Kaffrine est estimee a 22 000 Hab. et passerait a 31 000 Hab. en
l'an 2005. A cela, il faudra ajouter la population de son Departement (cf. Paragraphe 2).
* Aussi, la programmation d'un poste de sante permet de repondre a une demande actuelle
largement insatisfaite et qui ne fera que s'amplifier a l'avenir. En fait, la demande actuelle
peut meme justifier la cr6ation de 2 postes de sante.
4. Gestion et entretien du poste de sante
La loi portant transfert des competences aux regions, communes et communautes rurales
prevoit le transfert de certains equipements de base dont les postes de sante aux communes,
ce transfert inclut evidemment la responsabilite en matiere de gestion et entretien.
Par ailleurs, il est prevu dans le "contrat de ville" que la commune consacre annuellement 3%
de son budget ordinaire A l'entretien des infrastructures equipements (a faire executer par
l'entreprise); cette disposition permettra de prendre en charge progressivement l'entretien du
patrimoine communal.
5. Dimensionnement du projet et estimation des cofits
Le programme des postes de sante est normalise par le Ministere de la Sant. Aussi, les
composantes du programme sont;
Designation de la composante                        Caracteristiques - Couits
* batiment du poste de sante                        145 m2- 25 Millions de Fcfa
* Equipements du poste (selon une nomenclature standard)  * 5 Millions de Fcfa
* Logement d'infirmier (necessite d'assurer les urgences)   * 8 Millions de Fcfa
* Total                                             * 38 Millions de Fcfa
6. Justification globale
Le projet est prioritaire et repond * des besoins urgents et non satisfaits. Par ailleurs, le cout
du projet est strictement circonscrit a un niveau minimal repondant au comblement de
l'insuffisance constatee dans un secteur prioritaire.

Amenagements de Voirie
Justification Economique
I. G6neralit&s
Le calcul des avantages economiques apportes par un projet de voirie urbaine est
essentiellement fonde sur ceux qui sont g6neres par l'amnlioration des couts d'exploitation
des v6hicules ainsi que ceux qui vent resultant de la diminution des temps de deplacement
des usagers. L'estimation des cofits et des avantages se fait en considerant les deux situations
suivantes:
* situation sans amenagement (situation de reference) dans laquelle on suppose que
l'investissement n'est pas realise;
* situation avec amenagement (situation avec projet) ou l'on suppose au contraire qu'on
realise l'investissement consid&e.
a. Liste des Avantages
Les avantages sont de differentes natures. Pour l'essentiel, ils consistent dans les surplus
economiques apportes aux consommateurs; mais ils s'etendent egalement aux autres agents
6conomiques: il s'agit de la variation du revenu net des entreprises (priv6es ou publiques) et
6ventuellement de l'Etat.
Pour un projet de voirie urbaine les avantages les plus determinants sont:
-1 les avantages apportes par le projet et lies aux cofits d'exploitation des vehicules; il
s'agit notamment des gains suivants: differentiel de consommation de carburant
resultant d'une augmentation de la vitesse moyenne (sur section courante et aux
carrefours) gain sur les frais d'amortissement et d'entretien...
92 les avantages resultant du gain de temps des usagers par la r6duction des distances
et/ou I'augmentation de la vitesse; ce gain de temps est traduit en avantage economique
en attribuant une valeur moyenne au temps des usagers;
D'autres avantages peuvent egalement provenir du gain sur les cofits d'entretien de la voirie
(pour les communes) et les gains procures pour les entreprises.
La prise en compte des seuls avantages 1 et 2 procedera d'une demarche conservative.
b. Le Trafic
En ce qui concerne le trafic on peut le dissocier en trois composantes:
* le trafic normal
* le trafic derive
* le trafic induit
Le trafic normal
Ce trafic est celui qui circule sur la voie dans les conditions actuelles c'est-a-dire sans la
realisation du projet.
Le trafic derive:
Le trafic derive est le trafic qui circule actuellement sur un itin6raire concurrent mais qui est
derive par 1'execution du projet pour beneficier des nouvelles conditions de transport.



Annexe 14
Page 7 / 18
Le trafic induit:
C'est le trafic supplementaire du au developpement de la ville garce a la realisation du projet.
A moins que l'on soit dans une grande ville ou les effets de "reseau" se font sentir, on peut
g6neralement s'en tenir dans la plupart des cas au trafic normal en sous estimant les
avantages apportes par les deux autres composantes de trafic.
c Calcul des avantages et cofits
II s'agit de degager l'echeancier des "couits - avantages" annuels (en effectuant la somme
algebrique des avantages et des couits resultants annuellement et ce sur la duree de vie
economique du projet).
Le probleme considere et celui d'un investissement initial I donnant lieu a une suite
d'avantages annuels Al, A2, A3... An i partir de la mise en service dont l'ann6e 1 est
supposee choisie jusqu'a une annee n consideree comme horizon economique.
Rappelons que le taux de rentabilite inteme est la valeur du taux a d'actualisation tel que
l'avantage total actualise soit nul:
A l      A2                At             An
A- 1         + ----+---------+----- -  +- --------------- - -------- =0
(1 +a)   (l+a)2           (1+a)t        (1+ a)n
dL Prix economiques
Le calcul 6conomique etant fait pour la Collectivite Nationale, iH s'agira d'adopter une
demarche qui permette de ne comptabiliser que les cofits - avantages reels resultant pour la
Collectivit6:
* d'abord, les flux internes entre agents economiques ne vent pas pris en compte, il s'agit
d'integrer uniquement les couits des facteurs et les avantages resultants pour 1'economie
(ainsi les taxes ne vent pas prises en compte)
* ensuite, il s'agit de prendre en compte les veritables couits economiques (differents
generalement des prix du marche) exprimes par les "prix de reference". Si l'on ne
dispose pas des prix de reference pour le cas de l'economie Senegalaise, on peut - en
premiere approximation - consid6rer:
* les prix de marche expurges de toutes les composantes fiscales (prix HT)
* pour certains postes importants de couts tels que la main d'oeuvre non qualifiee, applique
un coefficient d'abattement sur le couit moyen du marche de cette main d'oeuvre.
H. Hypotheses pour la d6termination de la rentabilit6
Pour des 6tudes preliminaires il est possible de disposer de methodes rapides et simples pour
la determination du taux de rentabilise interne. Aussi, nous adopterons les hypotheses et
donnees suivantes:
a. Cofit de l'investissement
Le cout de l'investissement de chacune des voies est donne dans les devis estimatifs
correspondants resultant des propositions de l'audit urbain. Ces couits prennent en compte les
caracteristiques des voies et sont hors taxes.



Annexe 14
Page 8 l 18
b. DuFJe de vie des ouvrages realises
Le calcul sera fait pour une duree de vie de 20 ans.
a Trafic annuel a considirer
Suivant l'importance des voies A amenager, il s'agira:
* pour les amenagements importants d'effectuer une campagne significative de comptages
de trafic donnant: le trafic journalier moyen, la repartition de ce trafic selon les
differentes categories de vehicules (vehicules legers, minibus ou cars rapides, bus,
vehicules de transport lourd), taux d'occupation moyens, les elements economiques
caracterisant les usagers tels que leur revenu moyen et leur motivation de d6placement;
* pour les amenagements moins lourds, estimer visuellement le trafic journalier moyen et
sa repartition entre les differentes cat6gories de vehicules, et classer la voie par son
niveau de trafic, classement sommaire par exemple
* classe 50 A 100 Wh /jour
* classe 100 a 200 Wh / jour
* classe 200 a 300 Veh /jour
* classe 300 A 500 Wh /jour
d Taux d'accroissement du trafic
LA aussi, et selon les outils de prevision dont on dispose (et adaptes A la plus ou moins
grande importance du reseau et des voies A amenager), on pourra:
- soit 6tablir des previsions de trafic a partir de modeles de prevision de trafic (cas de
reseau de Dakar)
 ou bien dans le cas des am6nagements de voirie des villes de l'interieur, justifier
l'evolution du trafic sur la base de l'evolution pr6visionnelle des variables explicative
pertinentes (population, emplois, economie, croissance observee et previsionnelle de la
motorisation)
e. Cofit d'entretien des voies
A defaut d'estimations plus fines pour les voies rev8tant une certaine importance, on pourra
adopter l'hypothese d'une depense globale (entretien courant et periodique) d'entretien de
5%/an de la valeur de P'amenagement (a partir de la 50 ann6e).
f Co&it d'exploitation des vehicules (C.E. V.)
Ces cofits (differenties selon le type de vehicules) comprennent generalement:
* les cofits d'amortissement
* les cofits fixes (assurance)
* Ia consommation de carburant
* les cofits d'entretien
La aussi, pour les amenagements importants, des estimations relativement fines gagneraient
a 8tre faites sur ces postes en faisant ressortir les C.E.V. dans les deux situations (r6f6rence
et projet).
Pour les petite anienagements, on pourra adopter une demarche plus simplifiee focalisee sur
deux principaux postes:
* les couits d'amortissement: on estimera la duree d'amortissement realiste selon le type de
vehicules dans les deux situations: reference et projet.
* les cofits de consommation de pneumatiques, de carburant et lubrifiant: d'une part, on



Annexe 14
Page 9 / 18
estimera les consommations horaires par type de vehicule et d'autre part on estimera les
vitesses moyennes par type de vehicule pour les deux situations (reference et projet). II
en resultera le differentiel de cout entre les deux situations.
g. Estimation des avantages resultant du gain de temps pour les usagers
La aussi, la demarche sera differentiee selon l'importance des amenagements
* pour les projets importants, des estimations fines seront faites: soit a partir de modeles de
simulation de transport urbain (cas de Dakar) soit a partir de methodes empiriques
(estimation des gains de temps en section courante resultant du gain de vitesse et
estimation des gains au niveau des carrefours dont le fonctionnement serait ameliore).
* pour les amenagements moins importants, on pourra se contenter des gains de temps
resultant des gains en vitesse moyenne apportes par l'amenagement.
Par la suite, la traduction des gains de temps en avantages economiques se fera selon la
demarche suivante:
* la ddtermination de la valeur horaire economique du temps des usagers: la base de la
d6termination est le revenu moyen des usagers qui beneficieront d'un gain de temps dans
leurs deplacements a motivation professionnelle. Aussi, pour les amdnagements
importants, les enquetes fourniront les donnees de base sur la population b6neficiaire:
revenu moyen, motifs de deplacement... Pour les amenagements mineurs, on pourra se
contenter d'estimations moyennes.
 ensuite, la valeur dconomique moyenne du temps des usagers 6tant ddterminee, la
connaissance des taux d'occupation moyens des vehicules permettra la quantification des
avantages economiques par vehicule et ulterieurement les avantages globaux compte
tenu du trafic de depart et des hypotheses de son evolution.
-IH. Calcul de rentabilite
Ce calcul se soldera par l'elaboration des tableaux reprisant l'echeancier des - cofits
avantages - tel que defini ci-avant. Cet ech6ancier permettra de degager les ratios et valeurs
pertinents dont notamment:
* Le taux de rentabilite interne economique (TRI) tel que defini plus haut. Le niveau de ce
TRI devrait depasser le seuil d'eligibilite fixe par le manuel de procedure de l'ADM;
* La valeur actuelle nette (VAN) etablie sur la base d'un taux d'actualisation de reference
(10%).
IV. Test sur deux exemples:
Pour la voirie urbaine, nous prendrons deux exemples:
* un projet important d'amenagement de voirie. II s'agit du Projet d'Amenagement de
I'Avenue Blaise Daigne (Troncon Malick Sy - Gueule Tapee), projet prepard par le
Bureau de la Voirie et de la Circulation urbaines. Dans ce cas, les donnees d'etude ont
ete mise a jour en tenant notamment compte de celles publiees par le Ministere de
l'Equipement et des Transports Terrestres en Mai 1995 (Cofits et conditions
d'exploitation des vehicules routiers au Senegal - Direction des Transports Terrestres -
Mai 1995)
* un projet d'amenagement de voirie d'un portance limitees. II s'agit duProjet de Voirie
Rev8tue (Liaison RN1 - KAF 2 Nord) identifie dans le cadre de l'audit urbain de
Kaffrine etabli par l'Unite du PAC.



Annexe 14
Page 10/18
Dans le premier cas les donnees de base ont ete generalement etablies avec les enquetes et
investigations importantes (campagne de comptages, releves de vitesse sur le terrain banc
d'essai a la SOTRAC pour la consommation de carburant)
Dans le deuxieme cas, il s'agit d'estimations rapides apres une visite du terrain (classe de
trafic....)
V. Quelques implications pour mener l'analyse economique des projets de voirie
On notera que cet exercice suppose:
* l'identification et le calcul des cofuts avantages selon la nature et la specificite du projet.
Cela signifie qu'au moins une etude preliminaire (pre-faisabilite) a ete effectuee pour
fournir les donnees a prendre en consideration.
* En particulier, un niveau d'investigation minimal est a entreprendre: comptages de trafic,
determination des temps de parcours (ou vitesses moyennes sur le troncon avant
amenagement)...
* En outre, 1'estimation des couts economiques relatifs aux frais d'exploitation des
vehicules, la valeur du temps pour les usagers beneficiaires..
Aussi, les deux exemples de voirie traites plus loin montrent qu'un certain nombre d'outils
seraient utiles lors de la programmation des projets et leur justification:
* d'abord et d'une maniere generale, il serait pertinent que l'ADM (notamment en
collaboration avec le Ministere competent) constitue et maintienne une base de donnees
comportant notamment:
* les couits d'exploitation des vehicules (consommations specifiques, frais d'entretien...)
* des elements sur les vitesses de base des vehicules selon la classe (de trafic de la
voirie, son etat et niveau d'am6nagement ...)
* les couts standards d'amenagement selon differents parametres: etat initial, niveau
d'am6nagement cible, conditions particulieres locales multiples...(A developper dans
le catalogue d'investissement)
* les coefficients de passage entre les cofits de marche et les coats economiques (prix de
reference)
- ensuite, et pour les projets sur les reseaux importants (notamment Dakar), inciter au
developpement de modeles de prevision (modeles de transport urbain) qui permettent
une planification rationnelle de la voirie structurante et permettent de fournir les
elements de pr6vision economique.

Projet d'Equipement Marchand
Gare Routiere a Joal Fadiouth
Analyse Financiare
1. Le projet
II s'agit d'un projet figurant au programme d'equipement de la commune. Ce projet a fait l'objet
d'un accord de financement de la BHS sur le compte de Credit Communal.
II est presente ici A titre d'illustration pour l'analyse economiques d'un projet d'equipement
marchand. Notons par ailleurs que dans le cadre du PAC, les projets economiques d'un montant
inferieur A 250 millions de Fcfa ne sont traites qu'au niveau de la rentabilite financiere.
2. Situation actuelle
Cette situation est caracterisee par l'absence d'infrastructure et equipement: la gare routiere actuelle
est une simple place non amenagee du centre ville pressentant des insuffisances et problemes aigus:
securite, absence d'organisation, absence de commodites aux usagers...
3. Appreciation de la demande actuelle et future
3.1 Demande Actuelle
Le trafic actuel de vehicules de transport collectif a ete estime A partir de statistiques et comptages
effectues A differentes periodes caracteristiques de l'annee. II est ventile en diff6rentes categories
de vehicules et reparti selon les saisons:
Mois moyen   Juin   Octobre       Mars
Vhicules de 25 places             544            507  577           543
Vehicules de 14 places            580           5339  840           653
Taxis de 7 places                 707            631  542           627
Taxis brousse de 7 places          57             51   85            64
Taxis brousse de 14 places        223            132  335           250
3.2 La Demande Future
Cette demande est difficile A apprecier compte tenu de l'absence de statistiques relatives a
l'evolution du parc de vehicules de transport collectif. Neanmoins, il est realiste de supposer que
cette demande sera croissante eu egard a la croissance demographique et au developpement
economique qui s'appuie sur le secteur agricole et de la p8che (Joal etant le premier port de p8che
artisanale du Senegal).
3.3 Besoin d'Integration de Certaines Activites Commerciales au Sein de la Gare Routiere
Le fonctionnement d'une gare routiere fait appel a des activit6s annexes pour concourir A la
satisfaction de la demande des voyageurs: souks, gargotes, petite commerces...
4. Dimensionnement des equipement
L'etat actuel des equipement existants, le niveau de demande actuelle et potentielle ainsi que le
besoin d'integration de certains activites commerciales annexes ont conduit A la conception d'un
equipement comportant les amenagements suivants:
* aires de stationnement (devant satisfaire la demande actuelle et une demande futur
correspondant A un horizon de 5 ans)
* 5 restaurants (garrottes)
* 25 souks pour le commerce
* edicules publics
* un bloc administratif (bureau, poste de controle)
* un espace d'attente pour les voyageurs
Ces amenagements se traduisent par des investissements totalisant 107,316 Millions de Fcfa.

5. Etude de rentabilite financiere
5.1 Hypotheses
* Evaluation des d6penses
l'hypothese retenue par la commune est une gestion en regie de la gare routiere (hormis l'edicule
qui sera privatise)
Aussi, l'ensemble des charges recurrentes se ventile en:
* Depenses de main d'oeuvre: elles sont circonscrites a la prise en charge de collecteurs, les
frais de gardiennage et de nettoiement etant du ressort des transporteurs chauffeurs et
commercants
* Maintenance des ouvrages:
* pour la voirie: 8% du couit de l'investissement de cette composante seront consentis tous
les 3 ans
* pour les bitiments: 2% du cofit de l'investissement de cette composante seront consentis
annuellement (hormis l'entretien des souks suppose a la charge des commercants)
* les frais d'eau et eclairage
* Evaluation des recettes
Les recettes attendues concernent les droits de stationnement (sur les vehicules), la location des
garrottes et souks, les droits de place journaliers recouvres aupres des marchands ambulants et la
patente recuper6e par la commune sur les activit6s de la gare routiere.
Les tarifs unitaires sont estimes sur la base de ceux actuellement en vigueur avec cependant une
r6vision partielle A la hausse pour tenir compte des ameliorations apportees par le projet. Quant
aux taux de recouvrement, ils sont 6galement fixes a un niveau comparable au taux observes
actuellement.
5.2 Resultats
Les tableaux en annexe explicitent les resultats de l'tude financiere. II s'en degage notamment que
ce projet:
* pr6sente des indicateurs financiers atteignant des seuils acceptables: TRI de 14% environ, une
valeur actualis6e nette (au taux; d'actualisation de 10%) egale a 55 Millions de Fcfa
* un cash flow positif tout au long de la vie du projet (et des la premiere annee) ce qui sous-
tend que la commune n'aura pas de difficultes a honorer le remboursement du cr6dit.
Notons enfin que ces rdsultats sont obtenus sur la base d'hypotheses realistes sur:
* les taux de recouvrement
* les niveaux de tarifs a appliquer
* les recettes escomptees puisque certaines recettes n'ont pas e  a titre conservatif - prises en
compte: droits sur les gros transporteurs et vehicules hippomobiles
* une valeur residuelle evaluee a 50% de l'investissement initial au bout de 15 ans et ce compte
tenu de charges d'entretien (courantes et periodiques) prises en comptes dans les depenses
recurrentes.

Evaluation de l'Impact Environnemental pour la preparation des Sous-Projets
]L'objectif du Programme d'Appui aux Communes (PAC) est de stimuler l'effort de redressement
des Communes d'une part, et de soutenir leur effort d'investissement pour la production et la
fourniture des infrastructures, equipements et services prioritaires. L'organe de mise en oeuvre
du PAC est l'Agence de Developpement Municipal (ADM). Les communes doivent identifier
des "sous-projets" d'investissements. A cette fin, une grille de criteres d'eligibilitd des sous-
projets a ete elaboree, et est accompagnee d'une liste de criteres d'evaluation "d'impacts
environnementaux".  Cette liste d'impacts environnementaux est extraite des rapports et
documents suivants: Etude sur I'Environnement Urbain au Senegal (1993), Compldment de
l'Etude sur I'Environnement Urbain au Senegal (1994), les Procedures et Methodologie
Environnementales du Projet de Developpement de Lome IV, rapport d'dvaluation du
Programme de Developpement de la Gambie et l'Evaluation des Impacts Environnementaux des
Projets de Rehabilitation Urbain en Tunisie. Ce canevas d'evaluation a ete conqu de facon a: (a)
6valuer les sous-projets avec des criteres pratiques et (b) sensibiliser les communes aux impacts
environnementaux des projets. Les criteres sont adaptes a chaque type d'investissement: (a)
voirie et reseaux divers; (b) assainissement et d6chets; (c) equipements marchands (marche, gare
routiere, abattoir...); et (d) dquipements socio-collectifs (equipements sanitaires, ecoles, etc.).
