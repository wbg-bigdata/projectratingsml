MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
IDA TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF MAURITANIA
FOR A GENERAL EDUCATION PROJECT
1.          I  submit for your  approval the  following  memorandum  and
recommendation on a proposed development credit to the Islamic Republic of Mauritania
for SDR 23.8 million (US$35.0 million equivalent), on standard IDA terms with a
maturity of 40 years, to help finance a general education project. The Government will
contribute US$4.3 million equivalent, and local communities will contribute US$3.3
million equivalent.
2.          Country Background. Mauritania is a vast desert country of about one
million square kilometers, with a very limited resource base and a population of just over
two million, growing at a relatively high rate of 2.8% per year. Per-capita income is
US$510, placing Mauritania at the upper end of low-income economies. The level of
urbanization is 48%, the highest in the Sahel and well above the Sub-Saharan Africa
average of 29%. Standards of living are low: life expectancy at birth is only 47 years;
infant mortality is 120 per thousand live births; and 66% of the population aged 15 and
over is illiterate. Major economnic activities include iron ore mining in the North, irrigated
agriculture in the Senegal valley, and the fishing industry, which together account for all
export earnings (mining 39%, fishing 57%). The commercial fishing industry is dominated
by foreign interests and employs fewer than 10,000 Mauritanian workers. Agricultural
production fluctuates as a result of periodic droughts; however, subsistence agriculture is
the largest employer (about 50% of the working population) and contributes about one-
fourth of GDP.
3.          Between 1980 and 1991, GNP per capita declined in real terms by an
average of 1.8% a year due, inter alia, to a fall in world prices for iron ore, many years of
drought and the 1989 conflict with Senegal coupled with subsequent cutbacks in external
financing.  However, past adjustment programs (Economic and Financial Recovery
Program, 1985-88 and Consolidation Program, 1989-91) were notably successful in
reorienting Government policy in public resource management, credit, pricing, trade,
banking, public enterprise management and private sector promotion. By late 1992,
inflation had stabilized; the current account deficit fell; the Ougiya was devalued by 27%
against the US dollar (in October 1992) to boost competitiveness and exports; and GDP
grew in real terms by 4.9% in 1993. The plan for 1993-96 emphasizes sustainable GDP
growth (3.5%), containment of inflation (to 3.5%), equilibrium in external current
accounts, strong promotion of the private sector, broadening the tax base and raising
domestic savings.
4.          Sector Background.  The general education system, operated by the
Ministry of Education, consists of six years of primary schooling (enseignement
fondamental) and three years each of lower- and upper-general secondary education
(college and lycee). Instruction is provided in two separate streams, the filiere Arabe,



- 2 -
which uses Arabic as the language of instruction, and the fihire bilingue, which uses
French. The Arabic stream accounts for 94% of primary students and 89% of secondary
students. Higher education is offered by the University of Nouakchott and five post-
secondary specialized institutions while primary teachers are trained at two teacher
training colleges--Ecole Normale d'Instituteurs in Nouakchott and Aioun -- and secondary
teachers are trained at the Ecole Normale Superieure in Nouakchott. In 1993/94, about
220,000 students were enrolled in primary schools (72% of the school-aged population),
and 40,000 in general secondary education. The ENIs enrolled about 800 students, the
ENS 200, and the University 7,500.
5.          The Government's education sector policies were last formulated within the
context of the 1986 national plan for economic, social and cultural development, which
recognized education as a development priority. Based on this plan, a number of short-
term action programs, generally of two years duration, have directed the development of
the sector. Little progress was registered up to 1990. But since then, the demand for
education has increased significantly due to a combination of factors internal and external
to the education system. Between 1990 and 1993, the number of students enrolled in
primary grade 1 increased from 33,000 to 57,000, representing 48% and 88% of the
population of six-year olds, respectively. The primary enrollment ratio increased from
51% to 72% as a result, the largest increase achieved in any Sahelian country in such a
short time. Communities put up classrooms, often with Government assistance, and the
Government provided operating inputs. Pressures for increased access to secondary and
higher education are mounting also. Between 1990 and 1993, enrollment increased from
35,000 to 40,000 in general secondary education and from 7,500 to 10,000 in higher
education.
6.          For the period 1995-2000, the Government's priorities for education are
formulated in a Letter of Education Development Policy. Primary education will remain
the priority sub-sector, with the specific objective of increasing capacity to accommodate
all 6 to 11 year olds by the year 2000 while improving educational services (programs,
materials, and teachers). In secondary education, the focus will be on expanding access to
the lower cycle to accommodate an increasing number of primary school graduates, and
on improving the quality of education in both cycles. In higher education, the emphasis
will be placed on admission control and quality improvements, and on the development
and implementation of a long-term restructuring program to rationalize functions and
resource use, strengthen academic autonomy and management, improve scientific and
technological programs, and strengthen applied research. At all levels of education,
improved resource management and cost control will be emphasized, notably at the
primary and secondary levels through support for the expansion of private schools, and in
higher education through reductions in social costs.
7.          Project Objectives.   The IDA  credit would finance part of the
Government's education sector development program for the period 1995-2000, by
supporting policy measures and investments to: (a) increase primary enrollment in six
underserved regions and in peri-urban areas of Nouakchott to increase the average



- 3 -
enrollment rate to 80% and 90% in those areas respectively, and the national average to
87%; (b) increase girls' enrollment; (c) expand the capacity of lower-secondary education
to double intake; and (d) improve education quality and planning, management and
resource use at all levels of education.
8.          Project Description. To achieve these objectives, the IDA credit would
finance the following investments at the primary level: (i) the construction of 1,430 new
classrooms mostly in six educationally disadvantaged regions and in peri-urban areas of
Nouakchott and water supply and sanitary facilities for some 200 schools; (ii) a program
to boost girls' participation; (iii) the development and distribution of about 1,000,000
textbooks and teachers' guides in core subjects which would be loaned to students at a
ratio of one set per student; and (iv) improvements to curricula to incorporate health and
environmental education, and to pre-service teacher training and in-service teacher training
to diffuse special programs in multigrade and double-shift teaching and the promotion of
girls' education.
9.           At the secondary level, the project would finance: (i) the construction of
120 middle-school (collges) classrooms and auxiliary facilities (a maximum of 20
colMges) in towns currently without a secondary school; (ii) the provision of about
400,000 textbooks and teachers' guides in core subjects which would be rented to students
in sets at full cost recovery prices; (iii) the provision of science kits to improve science
instruction, and (iv) the rehabilitation and stocking of 20 libraries for Iycee students. In
higher education, the credit would finance urgent, but minor, rehabilitation of select
facilities at the University of Nouakchott and the preparation of a long-term restructuring
program which would form the basis of a future project in support of higher education.
To improve planning, management and resource use, the IDA credit would finance
equipment and consultant services in the areas of school mapping, personnel management,
project management, program implementation and evaluation in addition to a pilot
program to decentralize certain pedagogical support and education management functions
from the regional to the departmental level.
10.         In addition to these investments, the project would  support the
implementation of the following policy measures at the primary level to ensure the
attainment of enrollment targets within reasonable budgetary limits: (a) generalizing
double-shift and multigrade teaching to all eligible schools in urban and rural areas,
respectively, (b) reducing the repetition rate and (c) increasing the proportion of lower
paid instituteurs-adjoints to 75% of new recruits. At the secondary level, (a) average
teaching time for teachers would be increased from 18 to 25 hours a week through a
continuation of the re-deployment of lycee professors to the collges and by training
teachers to teach more than one subject; and (b) expenditures on non-teaching staff would
be reduced from 42% to 35% of the budget by continuing the policy of not replacing
retirees. At both the primary and secondary levels, the Government would implement
measures to promote the expansion of private schools.



- 4 -
11.         In parallel to this support, the Caisse fran,aise de developpement is
financing additional classroom construction at the primary and secondary levels and the
Cooperation fran,aise is supporting a program (Programme d'Appui a la Renovation du
Systeme Educatif Mauritanien 1994-1998) to improve the quality of programs and
instruction in mathematics and languages mainly at the secondary level.
12.         Project Implementation. Day-to-day management and implementation of
each project component would be carried out by designated units in the Ministry of
Education and it affiliates, with the Directorates of Primary Education (DEF), Secondary
Education (DES) and Planning (DPC), the University of Nouakchott, the National
Pedagogical Institute and the two Ecoles Normales d'Instituteurs responsible for
implementation of project components falling under their jurisdiction. The DPC would be
responsible for monitoring and evaluating the implementation of sectoral policies.
Coordination of project activities, monitoring of project implementation and outcomes,
procurement of goods and services, maintenance of project accounts, liaising with the
IDA, and inter-agency coordination, and the maintenance of an effective dialogue with
agencies and donors active in the education sector in would be provided by the
Directorate of Education Projects (DPE) which has been serving in that capacity for over
1 0 years.
13.         Responsibility for managing the community classroom  construction
program would be delegated by the Ministry of Education to the DPE, following
established procedures. Implementation would be governed by a procedural manual
specifying classroom designs as well as implementation and financing arrangements, all of
which are currently being applied under the ongoing education project (Cr. 1943-MAU)
while the DPC would prepare annual classroom construction and replacement programs,
based on an existing inventory of facilities. Management of the remaining civil works
programs and the procurement of related furniture and equipment would be delegated to
AMEXTIPE (Agence Mauritanienne d'Execution des Travaux d'Inter&t Public et de
l'Emploi), a non-governmental contract management agency established under the IDA-
financed Construction Capacity and Employment Project (Cr. 2455-MAU) under contract
to the Ministry of Education, following a procedural manual acceptable to IDA.
14.         Project Sustainability. The primary classroom construction program is
demand driven and executed by communities who contribute the equivalent of 30% of
estimated construction costs in cash or in kind. This arrangement has been shown to
reduce the burden on the Government budget and increase the likelihood of full usage.
The main sustainability issue concerns the ability of the Government to sustain the
recurrent costs of teachers' salaries required to expand access to primary education.
Mathematically, it is feasible but only if other important cost-saving avenues are
pursued, such as generalizing double-shift and multigrade teaching, recruiting a
majority of less credentialed teachers, reducing the number of teachers and
administrators in secondary education, controlling costs in higher education and
eliminating all civil servants from the budget who do not actually work for the Ministry
of Education. Each of these has proven difficult to achieve in other Sahelian countries.



- 5 -
This notwithstanding, the demand for primary education has risen so dramatically in
recent years, a demand partly generated by the effectiveness of the on-going classroom
construction program, that the Government is committed to taking the necessary
measures to ensure its continuity. It can ill afford to do otherwise and the
implementation of these measures will be monitored regularly during project
supervision.
15.         Lessons Learned. The Bank Group has supported the education sector in
Mauritania since 1975. The first two projects (Cr. 459-MAU, US$3.8 million, closed
1982; Cr. 1214-MAU, US$5.7 million, closed 1988) financed vocational and maritime
training, teacher training and strengthening of planning capacities. The third (ongoing)
operation (Cr. 1943-MAU, SDR 13.2 million, cofinanced by the AfDB) supports the
expansion of primary education and teacher training, the development and provision of
textbooks, a restructuring of secondary technical education, and quality improvements in
vocational training. Relatively good results with the last two components led to a free-
standing Technical Education and Vocational Training Support Project (Cr. 2521-MAU,
SDR 8.9 million) which became effective in March 1994.
16.         Completion reports of past and supervision reports of ongoing education
projects indicate that implementation is slowed down by cumbersome administrative
procedures, an out-of-date procurement system and delays in providing counterpart funds,
problems which also affect other sectors. Structural administrative problems will be
addressed on a country-wide level through a proposed Economic Management Project,
currently under preparation and scheduled to become effective in FY96. Procurement
problems are also being dealt with on a country basis through ongoing IDA reviews of
Mauritania's procurement procedures, while the issue of timely provision of counterpart
funds, particularly in foreign exchange, is being raised in the context of the 1995 public
expenditure review. In the education sector, the Government's continued reliance on
long-term technical assistance for many of its planning, programming and management
functions will be modified through the use of twinning arrangements with foreign
institutions having recognized experience in the areas of concern and capable of providing
short-term, sharply-focused assistance over the duration of the project.
17.         Rationale for IDA Involvement. The rationale for the proposed project
is consistent with the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy as discussed on March 8, 1994
in conjunction with the Board presentation of the Agricultural Extension Services Project.
The country strategy aims mainly to promote human resource development, efforts to
reduce poverty, private-sector led growth, improved economic management and capacity
building in core Government services. The focus of the proposed project on expanding
access to primary and lower secondary education in underserved areas and particularly for
girls is expected to increase literacy rates, improve productivity and health care and
provide a labor force better equipped to adapt to changing economic trends.  The
significant capacity building efforts supported by the project contribute directly to the
improvement of one of the main services provided by the Government. The proposed
project also forms part of our overall education strategy which emphasized sustained



- 6 -
policy dialogue with the Government on sectoral issues, the importance of primary
education to national development, expanding access to education for the most
disadvantaged groups, supporting the implementation of efficiency measures in the sector
and mobilizing donor support for sector investments.
18.         Agreed Actions. As conditions of credit effectiveness, the Government
would submit: (a) signed contracts for the regional construction coordinators; and (b) a
draft action plan and timetable, acceptable to IDA, to finalize the personnel inventory and
clean up the salary budget . There are no disbursement conditions.
19.         Environmental Aspects. This is a Category C project. Classrooms and
related structures would be located on vacant Government or community property, and
constructed following procedures and design standards approved by the Bank under the
ongoing education project (Cr. 1943-MAU).
20.         Project Objective Categories.  The project responds to the human
resource development and antipoverty objectives of the Government. Increasing primary
enrollment in poor rural areas and among girls increases opportunities and productivity
among the most disadvantaged groups, lowers infant mortality, improves health and
nutrition and results in higher levels of education and improved living standards in
succeeding generations.
21.         Project Benerits. Project benefits would be widespread. Over the five-
year period 1994/95-1999/2000, through classroom construction and efficiency measures,
the project would provide about 64,000 additional student places mostly in underserved
peri-urban areas of Nouakchott, and in six regions where access to primary education is
lowest, raising their enrollment ratios from between 60%-70% to an estimated 80%-90%
and the national enrollment ratio from 77% to nearly 90%. Mutually reinforcing
qualitative improvements, in the form of better trained teachers, an adequate supply of
textbooks and improved school management would improve learning and reduce
repetition and drop-out. The project would introduce or continue to support several
innovative measures, with potentially significant returns, such as: (i) programs to boost
girls' primary school enrollment from 44% to 50% of the total, and corresponding
increases in secondary education and teacher training; (ii) delegation of pedagogical
support from the central ministry to regional and departmental levels to make the system
more responsive to local needs; and (iii) improvements in environmental and health
education. Local communities would be required to participate financially in primary
school construction and maintenance, reducing the burden on the Government budget and
increasing ownership and sustainability.
22.         Project Risks.  There are three main risks. First, the Government's
capacity to manage a program of the scope envisaged under the project is not assured.
For the civil works components, this risk would be addressed by transferring responsibility
for implementing construction from the ministry to AMEXTIPE and communities, and
limiting the Government's role to oversight and quality control. Second, the innovative



- 7 -
programs proposed under the project, in particular those to boost girls' participation,
strengthening decentralization, and in-service teacher training, are risky and may not fully
reach their objectives. Risks in these areas would be addressed by detailed planning,
careful monitoring and annual reviews of progress, and making adjustments to project
scope and content during implementation when necessary.  Third, institutional and
management capacities may take longer than five years to improve. Recognizing this risk,
the proposed project would continue the process of capacity building begun under the
ongoing education project (Cr. 1943-MAU) with the expectation that additional support
would need to be provided under future projects.
23.         Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve it.
