MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO INDIA
FOR A THIRD NATIONAL SEEDS PROJECT
1.      The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed developtnent
credit of SDR 108.6 illion (US$150 million equivalent) to India is submitted
for approval. The proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms with 35
years maturity, and would helo finance the Third National Seeds Project.
2.      Background.  Agriculture in India accounted for about 35% of GDP and
25% of exports in 1986, and employed about 65% of the labor force.
Agricultural output has grown steadily during the past decades, with par-
ticularly impressive gains in foodgrain production which amounted to about
150 million tons in 1985/86, compared with 121 million tons in 1975/76. This
has been possible as a result of substantial increases in the area under
irrigation, increased use of high yielding varieties, fertilizer and improved
farming practices. However, the continuing increase in demand for food in
the country requires that agricultural productivity and production be
increased substantially in the medium to long term. The evolution of Indian
agriculture has also reached a stage where special attention is being given
to rainfed agriculture, in addition to irrigation development, to increase
food production. Also, greater emphasis is being given to expanding produc-
tion of oil-seeds, pulses and horticultural crops and sorghum and millets
which are the staple diet of the rural poor. It is clear therefore that
there is need for continuing improvements in the critical support services to
agriculture if the future challenges facing Indian agriculture are to be met.
In this respect, good quality seed is a vital agricultural input and the
availability and quality of seeds of suitable varieties will be key deter-
minants to increasing agricultural productivity.
3.      A major seed production program, "National Seed Program" (NSP), was
launched in the mid-1970s, based on the concept of a successful Bank Group
assisted project in Uttar Pradesh. The main emphasis of NSP was on creating
a national institutional framework for support and coordination of all facets
of production, storage, marketing and quality control of certified seeds.
One important feature of the program was the formulation of two Bank assisted
National Seeds Projects (NSP I and NSP II) which, inter alia, established
State Seeds Corporations (SSCs) in nine states to take over from the state
Departments of Agriculture (DOA) and the National Seeds Corporation (NSC) the
responsibilities for the production and handling of seed in their respective
states. NSP I and to a lesser extent NSP II were implemented considerably
behind schedule, particularly with respect to construction of physical
infrastructure, though by the extended Loan/Credit closing of these projects
most of the intended civil works were completed. The NSP concept was
expanded to cover other states and currently there are SSCs in 13 states.
4.      However, while the growth in the seed industry has been significant,
an effective and efficient seed industry has not yet fully evolved in India.
The public sector' B role in the industry is conotrained by: (a) the failure
to develop public corporations along commercial lines; (b) insufficient
managerial authority in these corporations; and (c) government intervention
in their operations, pricing and marketing decisions. In addition, there is



-2-
significant potential for private sector involvement in the industry on a
larger scale in an operating environment which has become increasingly
favorable for private initiative in recent years. In order for the industry
to perform more effectively there is a clear need for a realignment in its
structural and institutional framework, aimed at creating financially strong,
independent and business oriented public seed corporations and encouraging an
expanded role for the private sector.
5.      Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The project reflects the Bank Group's
assistance strategy to support the Government of India's (GOI) efforts co
improve the efficiency of key services and to adopt those policies which best
contribute to a resilient agricultural production environment in which
farmers can efficieatly respond to emerging market opportunities.  IDA par
ticipation would assist GOI efforts to undertake the significant
administrative, institutional and financial reforms needed to improve the
management and efficiency of the public sector seed corporations, consolidate
earlier investments made under Bank Group assisted projects, enhance private
sector involvement, and foster overall competitiveness and efficiency in the
industry. Through these efforts, the project would help meet the farmers'
requirements throughout the country for good quality seed of suitable
varieties.
6.      Project Objectives.  Key objectives under the proposed project would
be to promote "ve development of a market responsive, financially viable seed
industry. The emphasis would be on reorienting the operations of selected
public sector seed corporations along commercial lines in order to improve
their financial viability and long-term sustainability, encouraging greater
private initiative by providing investment .-nds, and developing the institu-
tional environment conducive to the long term growth of the industry.
7.      Project Description.  The proposed funding would consist of a project
component (US$68 million) and a program component (US$110 million). The
project component would be in two parts. Part one (US$54 million) would be a
line of investment credit channelled thro.'gh the National Bank for
Agricultural and Rural Development (NABARD) and eligible Participating Banks
(PBs) which would finance seed production (farm development), processing and
associated storage facilities in public sector seed corporations and private
sector seed companies. Part two (US$14 million) would directly finance
equipment and limited operating expenses and consultancy services for The
Indian Council for Agricultural Research's (CAR) variety development
programs, breeder and foundation seed farm development in State Agricultural
Universities (SAUs), infrastructure necessary for seed industry regulation
and quality control, equipment for promoting on-farm seed cleaning, consult-
ancy services aimed at financial and management strengthening of public
sector corporations, and training to enhance the managerial and technical
skills of managers in the industry.
8.      The program component (US$110 million) which would become available
for disbursement in 3 stages would support a series of institutional and
administrative reforms aimed at improving productivity and operational
efficiency of about 13 public sector corporations. These reforms by
emphasizing autonomy of management, financial and institutional strengthening
and the progressive phasing out of government financial support would aim to
reorient the operations of these public sector corporations along commercial
lines, leading to the restoration of their financial viability and long term
sustainability as business entities. The release of funds under the program



-3-
component would be structvtrd to recognize -ritical steps taken by GOI and
the State Governments (GOSs) to first, appoint suitable consultants to review
the financia. structure and operational procedures of  their respective
corporations; second, draw up an action plan for each seed corporation to be
recorded in an Action Plan Implementation Agreement (APIA) between NSC/SSCs
and GOI/GOSs acceptable to IDA, specifying tile corrective measures to be
undertaken to address key administrative and institutional weaknesses iden-
tified by the consultants; and third, to implement the APIA as scheduled.
The conditions for release of the program component are specified in para 11.
Funds under the program component would be used to finance imports of items
needed for the agricultural sector consisting mainly of agr.cuitural inputs
(including pesticides), veterinary medicines, animal feed and, petroleum and
petroleum products. The latter imports are destined for end-use in the
agricultural sector. Annual diesel fuel use by tractors and pumpsets is
currently estimated at 4 million tonnes (approximate import value of about
US$700 million) and is expected to increase by about 2-3% annually. India's
diesel requirements are either imported directly, or refined from petroleum
imports.
9.      The project would be implemented by a Project Management Unit (P?Q)
under the overall direction of the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) and is
expected to be carried out over 6 1/2 years. The total cost of the project
is estimated at US$177.5 million equivalent. A breakdown of costs and the
financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement
and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B.
A timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank group
operations in India are given in schedules C and D, respectively. A map is
attached. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 6982-IN is being distributed
separately.
10.     Agreed Actions.  GOI and the state Governments (GOSs) have agreed on
the following actions: (a) to carry out a review by suitable consultants
of the financial and management structure and operating procedures of seed
corporations receiving funds under the credit and the drawing up of suitable
action plans to be recorded in a APIA .atisfactory to IDA addressing areas of
weaknesses; (b) following the consultants' review and as required in the
APIA, financially restructure tbeir respective corporations and allow the
corporations to exercise their autonomy in pricing, production and management
decisions; (c)  realign the roles of the public sector seed institutions as
necessary to rationalize seed production activities; (d) allow the applica-
tion of stringent loan approval criteria by the PBs to ensure viability of
proposed investments; and (e) provide appropriate staffing, reporting and
auditing requirements under the project.
11.     In addition, GOI has also agreed that the program component would
become available for disbursement in 3 stages: (a) the first of US$40 million
on:  (i) appointment of the consultant to the PMU; and (Tii  commencement of
consultant reviews of at least 3 SSCs and NSC; (b) the second of US$35 mil-
lion on: (i) completion of consultant reviews of at least 3 SSCs and NSC
and implementation of resultant action plans in a manner satisfactory to IDA;
and (ii) commencement of consultant reviews of at least 5 additional SSCs;
and (c) the third of US$35 million on: (i) completion of consultant reviews
of the 5 SSCs referred to in (b)(ii) above and satisfactory progress in
implementation of the action plans by all the corporations which have com-
pleted the consultant reviews; and (ii) commencement of consultant reviews
of all remaining participating corporations. The second and third stages of



-4-
the program component are expected to become available for lisbursement
approximately eighteen months and thirty-six months after the first.
12.    Benefits.  The main benefits from the project would be the development
of an efficient seed industry through the creation of financially self sus-
taining and market responsive public sector corporations, and the encourage-
ment of greater private initiative in the industry. The financial independ-
ence of public sector seed corporations would also reduce and ultimately
eliminate the need for GOI/GOSs budgetary outlays to sustain these institu-
tions in the future. Economic benefits from the project are expected from
the increases in agricultural production and productivity as a result of the
availability of good quality seed. Directly quantifiable benefits would
result from the production of wheat, rice, maize, jowar (sorghum), baira
(millet), gram, soyabeans, groundnuts and mustard from improved certified
seed produced by the public sector corporations. The project is expected to
have a direct impact on poverty alleviation As many of the users of project
produced improved seed would be small farmers. The internal economic rate of
return of the project component is 32%.
13.     Risks.  The main risk relates to the project's reform objectives for
the corporations considered essential for their financial viability and long
term sustainability as business entities responsive to farmer needs. These
reforms will require very substantial measures to be taken by both GOI and
the GOSs. The program component has been designed and structured to support
iOI's efforts to ensure the GOSs' commitment to implement the neccssary
reforms. In addition, to allow for delays that may arise as a result of firm
application of onlending conditions based on financial viability, project
implementation has been scheduled over 6 1/2 years.
14.     Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
