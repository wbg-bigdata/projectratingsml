                         has been satisfactory. Almost all the agreed actions of the February 2012 fifth review and implementation support mission have been effectively fulfilled well before the due dates.
                         •         Completion rate of carried over community sub-projects was successful. Out of the 631 community sub projects carried over from 2003 EFY (2010/2011) and planned to be
                         completed in the 2004 EFY (2011/2012). Accordingly, the project has successfully completed 568 (90%) sub projects. Another 17(3%) sub projects that were at very early stage have

                         been canceled with the decision of the community and the woreda development committee (WDC) and the rest 46 sub projects (7%) have been carried over to the 2005 EFY

                         . As part of the awareness creation and capacity building exercise, the project managed to mobilize and consult close to 1,073,821 beneficiary communities or 52 % of the target
                         population during the 2004 EC (2011/12) Community Action Plan (CAP) preparation process. 45% of participants were women and 20% were youth. This is an important activity that
                         ensures ownership and sustainability of development interventions in pastoral areas.
                         •         Beneficiary communities are effectively fulfilling their commitment to implement the FY 2004 EC (2011/12) new sub-projects. Accordingly, ETB 12.6 million or 98 % of the
                         plan was collected from beneficiary communities as part of the 5% cash contribution to implement the 488 new sub-projects. From the 488 new sub projects planned for the 2004
                         EFY, implementation of 422 was initiated and 145 (30%) were completed. The remaining 343 sub projects have been planned to be completed as part of the 2005 EFY plan.
                         •         During the reporting period, a total of 946 sub-projects were made fully functional (97% of the plan) through the provisions of equipment, furniture and trained manpower;
                         including 283 schools, 236 water development, 118 health posts, 136 vet posts, 75 small scale irrigation schemes, 75 community roads, 4 range development and 25 others.
                         •         A total of 131 Pastoral Saving and Credit Coops (PaSACCOs) were established in 2004 EFY with a total membership of 7701 (70% female members). The members
                         mobilized ETB 1.11 million as paid share capital and ETB 1.19 Million as saving. Most of these groups have already started the inter-loaning for income generation and livelihood
                         diversification activities. So far the project has managed to establish a total of 449 PaSACCOs (81 % of the project plan) in the project Regions with a total membership of 27,901 (67
                         % female) with ETB 4.48 Million paid share capital and ETB 12.44 Million savings. Till the end of 2004 EFY, 446 (99%) PASACCOs have been registered and have a legal entities
                         and 347 (70 %) have opened bank account. Todate, 293 PASACCOs provided ETB 10.93 million inter-loaning to 10,568 members from their own saving. The project has also
                         disbursed ETB 11.48 million as seed capital for 185 PaSACCOs that fulfilled the required criteria. This was made possible after the required training and capacity building efforts.
                         •         Under the Pastoral Risk Management component of the project, the Pastoral Early Warning System has been effective in collecting, analyzing and interpretation early
                         warning data for informed decision making purposes. Accordingly, during the reporting period, 48 weekly and12 monthly early warning information were produced by the four major
                         pastoral regions of the country. The Early Warning and Response Directorate of MoA has been disseminating the monthly early warning reports to all concerned stakeholders.
                         •         The Disaster Preparedness Strategic Investment Program (DPSIP), with longer term disaster preparedness, reduction and mitigation objectives, has also been active in
                         supporting the beneficiary regions to design and implement strategic investments to complement the pastoral livelihoods resilience building efforts. During the reporting period, a total
                         of ETB 43.95 Million has been transferred to Somali, Oromiya and SNNP regions to implement DPSIP sub-projects that obtained the safeguard clearances. This makes the
                         cumulative budget transfer of ETB 87.19 million for DPSIP investments . Accordingly, activities in areas of range management, water development, small scale irrigation works,
                         livestock market development, forage production and road construction are underway in various pastoral areas of the country.
                         •         Implementation of the Knowledge Management and Networking component of the project is also progressing very well. The dynamic web site of the project www.pcdp.gov.
                         et, which is being used as one of its communication strategies, has been visited by 9556 in the fiscal year and more than 16 858 users since its launch. Experience sharing visits
                         among communities were conducted in Afar, Oromiya and Somali regions. Under the knowledge management sub-component, encouraging activities are underway, including
                         establishment of pastoral resource centers, establishment of 38 school mini-media clubs, production of newsletters, brochures and posters, documentary film production and
                         broadcasting of community radio programs through FM channel in four regiona and nine local languages.
                         •         Under the Policy Implementation Studies, all regions have established PLKM review committees. These committees are now functional in assessing policy implementation
                         issues. During the reporting period, the Oromiya Pastoral Commission is at the final stage to undertake an important Policy Implementation Study in collaboration with Horomaya

                         resolution strategy. Similarly Afar, Somali and SNNPr have identified policies for study with the support of the project. The project is also registering encouraging progress on the
                         identification and documentation of best practices in the pastoral context. Oroimiya region has established three PAL (participatory action learning) groups with a focus on vegetable
                         production, drip irrigation and cattle fattening. Afar region has also identified and documented two best practices.
