                         Implementation Status Overview
                         • Implementation progress of PCDP II is gathering satisfactory momentum and is moving in the right direction to fulfill its development objectives. The demand driven and community
                         centered development model of the project has effectively ensured ownership and sustainability of the investments prioritized and implemented by the target communities. The
                         commitment of the administrative structures at federal, regional, woreda and kebele levels to the project objectives and its demanding implementation arrangements has been
                         exemplary. Almost all the agreed actions of the fifth review mission have been effectively fulfilled well before the due dates.

                         •           As part of the 2005 EFY (2012/13) Community Action Plan (CAP) preparation process, the project managed to mobilize and sensitize close to 596,229 pastorals or 54% of
                         the target population in Somali, Oromiya and SNNP Regions. Female and youth attendants in this important meetings were 294,806 (49%) and 139,725 (23%) respectively.
                         •           In 2005 EFY (2012/13) a total of 394 new sub-projects were selected by beneficiary communities in 39 project woredas and most of the beneficiary communities have
                         fulfilled their commitment by contributing Birr 11.34 million in cash or 93% of the planned amount. So far, 358 (91% the total) sub-projects have reported a 100% cash contributions

                         from the beneficiary communities. In addition, in kind contribution valued at Birr 8,09 (27% of the annual plan) was made by the community for the implementation of the new
                         subprojects. .
                         • During the reporting period, out of the 202 completed sub projects, a total of 166 (82%) sub-projects were made fully functional through the provisions of equipment, furniture and
                         skilled manpower. These include 77 schools, 37 water development, 17 health posts, 12 vet posts, 13 small scale irrigation schemes and 9 community access roads.
                         •           A total of 448 Pastoral Saving and Credit Coops (PaSACCOs) were established up to the end of 2004 EFY (2011/12) with a total membership of 28,467 (70% female
                         members). The members mobilized Br 5.0 million as paid share capital and Br 14.4 million as saving. Moreover, while 446 PaSACCOs are legally registered some 365 have opened
                         bank accounts. To date, 300 PaSACCos provided loans totaling Birr 11.12 million from their own savings to 10,659 members, of which 6,802 (64%) are women members engaged in
                         different business activities based on their business plans. The project has also disbursed Birr 15.9 million as seed capital for 246 PaSACCOs that fulfilled the required criterion. A
                         total of 11,933 members (63% women) benefited from the seed capital. Repayment rate of mature loans at 91% is satisfactory.
                         •           Under the Pastoral Risk Management component of the project, the Pastoral Early Warning System (PEWS) has been effective in collecting, analyzing and interpretation
                         early warning data for informed decision making purposes. Accordingly, during the reporting period 24 weekly and 6 monthly early warning information focusing on conditions of
                         pasture, water supply, livestock body conditions, market prices, human health and amount of rainfall, were produced by the four major pastoral regions of the country. The Early
                         Warning and Response Directorate of MoA has been disseminating the monthly early warning reports to all concerned stakeholders. Based on the information from the PEWS, the
                         project transferred Birr 1.43 million for emergency water distribution to Afar Regional State to assist affected communities due to the total failure of Sugum rainfall.
                         •           The Disaster Preparedness Strategic Investment Program (DPSIP), with longer term disaster preparedness, reduction and mitigation objectives, has also been active in
                         supporting the beneficiary regions to design and implement strategic investments to complement the pastoral livelihoods resilience building efforts. During the reporting period,
                         establishment of nursery centers, construction of underground cisterns and ponds, establishment of secondary livestock market centers are under implementation in Somali, Oromia
                         and Afar regions following the approval of the plans by the respective Regional Steering Committees. The FPCU has also transferred a total of Birr 42.3 million to the four regions to
                         finance the DPSIP sub-projects, making the cumulative total of DPSIP transfers Birr 121.73 million during the last three years of PCDP II.
                         •           Implementation progress of the Knowledge Management and Networking component of the project is also progressing well. The dynamic web site of the project, www.pcdp.
                         gov.et, which is being used as one of its communication strategies, has been visited by more than 24,225 users since its launch.
                         •           Under the Policy Implementation Studies, all the project regions have established Pastoral Learning and Knowledge Management (PLKM) review committees. These
                         committees are now functional in assessing potential policy implementation issues and during the reporting period, policy implementation constraints identified by Oromia, SNNP,
                         Afar and Somali regions were reviewed and approved by their respective Regional Steering Committees for further study. Accordingly, Oromia region is at an advanced stage to
                         conduct a study on implications of Pastoral Sedenteralization in collaboration with Haremaya University.
                         •           The monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system of the project, which is being complemented by a management information system (MIS), is effectively collecting, analyzing
                         and documenting data on key performance indicators of the project at all levels.
                         •           Internal Audit unit has also been busy during the reporting period to ensure that the project resources are used effectively for the intended purposes. The unit has done a
                         good job in assessing and identifying risk factors. In doing so, the riskiness level of all the project woredas and entities have been determined. Accordingly, 20 entities were labeled
                         as high risk, 26 entities moderate and 17 entities low risk, followed by action plans for the mitigation measures.
                         •           According to the advances and aging analysis done by the Project, as of January 8, 2013 the outstanding advance to all regions amounts to Br. 158.5 million. All of these

                         advances are below 4 months old (19% below one month; 65% two months; 12% three months and 4% four months old). This is a significant improvement from previous records
                         which showed that significant amount of advances were more than six months old. The total disbursement rate of the project at 79 percent is also encouraging.
