                                     RESTRUCTURING PAPER

I. Introduction
    1. The proposed restructuring is for additional financing of US $ 1.3 million to support the external
        audit component of the project in the audit of MDTF and Republic of South Sudan financial
        statements. This would enable the project support all MDTF projects in implementation and
        closure of project activities. In September 2010, the project sought and obtained an extension to
        the project’s closing date from June 30, 2011 to September 31, 2012; use funds from procurement
        component financed under additional financing (TF097653) to support expenditures related to
        accounting and auditing components which were originally financed under the original grant
        (TF56336) as well as update of the project’s results framework. The Grant Agreement for
        TF097653 was amended to suitably reflect this change.

   2. The project’s development objective continues to be achievable, the performance of the borrower
      and project implementing agency is satisfactory and an action plan acceptable to the Bank has
      been prepared by the borrower to complete the project.


II. Background and Rationale for Additional Financing in the amount of USD $ 1.3 million
    3. The Core Fiduciary Systems Support Project (CFSSP) was approved on February 21, 2006 for an
       original amount of US$8.147 million. GRSS counterpart fund contribution is US$3 million. The
       project was designed to put in place a robust framework for channeling of MDTF-SS and GoSS
       counterpart funds to provide reasonable assurance regarding the use of these funds. An additional
       financing (TF097653) of US$3 million was approved by the Oversight Committee of the MDTF-
       SS in September 2010, with the same Project Development Objective (PDO) and closing date as
       the parent project at the time of the additional financing. The original grant focused on accounting
       and auditing components, while the additional financing focused on accounting, auditing and
       procurement component. All funds under the two grants have been fully disbursed.

   4. The project’s original closing date of November 30, 2008 was extended twice, first to June 30,
      2011 and then to September 30, 2012 to enable it provide fiduciary support in auditing and
      accounting to projects that were still under implementation.

   PROJECT STATUS
   5. The performance of the project is rated satisfactory. 100 percent of the original grant of US$8.1
      million and additional financing of US$3 million has been disbursed. All GRSS contribution of
      US$3 million has been fully disbursed. The progress towards achieving of PDO and overall
      implementation progress are satisfactory. Quarterly bank reconciliations and Statement of Sources
      and Application of Funds are prepared according to established standards; annual audits are
      prepared for all MDTF-SS and Bank projects as well as GRSS accounts; and efforts are on-going
      to ensure that the Ministries, Departments and Agencies carry out their procurements based on laid
      down guidelines. Financial Management and procurement are rated satisfactory and there is no
      outstanding audit or financial reports. There is no change to the existing financial management and
      disbursement arrangements for the two grants.

   6. The project has three components (parent plus AF)

                                                    6
           a. The accounting component which supports GRSS in project accounting and disbursements
              for all MDTF projects is progressing well and the quarterly and annual financial reports are
              regularly prepared. It would need to be on-going to provide accounting support and
              produce financial statement for all projects in the MDTF portfolio after their closure.

           b. The Auditing component which supports the Audit Chamber in institutional strengthening
              and audit of GRSS and MDTF Accounts is progressing well and all MDTF audits are up to
              date. Audits of GoSS and MDTF financial statements for years ended December 31, 2009
              is in progress and 2010 is expected to commence soon.

           c. The procurement component supports GRSS with the services of Procurement Agents and
              strengthening the Procurement Policy Unit in MoFEP. With the end of the contract of the
              Procurement Agent, an individual consultant as been engaged as a Procurement Advisor to
              support the Procurement Unit.

           d. There is no change in the PDO or results framework.


   III. PROPOSED CHANGES
   7. The proposed change is additional financing of US$1.3 million under TF097653 to support the
       external audit component of the project in the audit of MDTF and Republic of South Sudan
       financial statements.

APPRAISAL SUMMARY
IV. Appraisal Summary

Economic and Financial Summary
7. The GOSS was established in 2006, after the more than 20 years of devastating conflict. With the
independence in July 2011, the name changed to GRSS. The capacity and resource of GRSS for providing
primary health care and emergency services to its citizens has been severely limited. GRSS has been
struggling with budget credibility problems, illustrated by large deviations of actual spending from plans.

8. Technical: The project design remains the same and supports accounting, auditing and procurement
functions of GRSS.

Fiduciary
9. South Sudan is building its fiduciary system. The financial management arrangements for the project
are designed to address the country’s post-conflict situation and with the objective of building

                                                    7
 sustainable management. The system seeks to facilitate sound and prompt disbursements and use project
 resources and funds to ensure effective implementation. There are no changes to the financial
 management and procurement arrangements for the project.

10. Procurement Arrangements: The additional financing involves retention of an international audit
firm, engaged on the basis of international competition. The recruitment was carried out through the use
of the quality and cost based selection (QCBS) procedures stated in sections 2.1-2.31 of the Bank
Consultant Guidelines.

11. Financial Management Arrangements: This is a high risk – high reward operation in a weak
fiduciary environment. A detailed financial management assessment had been carried out at project
inception. Necessary fiduciary framework has been put in place to reduce the risk to an acceptable level
for both GRSS and the MDTF including use of a Monitoring Agent (MA) for the MDTF who monitors actual
expenditures and ensures compliance with fiduciary standards; a Project Financial Management Unit (PFMU)
responsible for ensuring proper accounting and reporting of transactions ; and a Procurement Agent (PA) to ensure
that procurement is conducted in a transparent and accountable manner, and in line with MDTF requirements.

12. Safeguards: An Environmental and Social Assessment Framework (ESAF) for MDTF Investments in
Southern Sudan has been finalized and approved by the Directorate of Environment in the Ministry of
Housing, Physical Planning and Environment and shared with all major GRSS sectors.

 13. Social Issues: There are a number of post conflict issues such as a lack of government institutions,
 procedures, legally defined rights, continuing conflicts in some areas, grievances arising from perceived
 lack of inclusiveness and equity that have the potential to undermine project activities and affect the
 distribution of goods procured under this project to the end users. Social risks largely arising from
 differential access to benefits, traditional rights and entitlements, adequacy of targeting mechanisms, and
 varying public perception of benefits will be addressed through continuous monitoring of agreed social
 indicators. For this particular project there are no social issues.

 14. Environmental Issue: There is no environmental issue in the project.

 15. Policy Exceptions: The Project does not seek any policy exceptions.
