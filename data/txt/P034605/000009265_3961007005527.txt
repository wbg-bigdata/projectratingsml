MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMNDATION OF TIE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTRNATIONAL DEVELOPMNT ASSOCIATION
TO T   EXECUTIVE DECTORS
ON A IPROPOSED CREDIT--TO THE REPUIBUC OF GUYANA
FOR A FINANCIAL SECTOR AND BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT PROJECT
1.           1 - I submit for your approval the following report and recommendeton on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Guyana for SDR 2.4 million tUS$ 3.5 million), on standard IDA
terms with a maturity of 40 years to help finane a project for the establishment of a strengthened
financial sector enviromnent and regulatory capacity, privatization of key public enterprises, and
improvement in the environment for foreign and domestic private investment.
County Backgound
2.           Begining with the Economic Recovery Program in 1988, Guyana has undertaken
far-reaching adjustment measures and structural reforms shifting towards a market-oriented economy,
supported by an IFM Standby/ESAF arrangement and IDA Structural Adjustment and Tecbmical
Assistance credits approved in June 1990. The 1993 Public Administration Project included support of
public sector management strengthening measures aimed at improving financial, regional, personnel and
general management for select ministries and regional administration. While growth resumed in 1991
and continued strongly in 1992-93, significant weaknesses continue to hamper private sector investment.
In particular, concerns about divestment procedures, together with a debate within goverment on the role
of the state have caused delays in the implementation of the privatization program and slowed investment.
Although there is significant growth potential in Guyana, the realization of this potental will require the
deepening of the market-oriented reforms, addressing the severe infrastucture constai  and facilitating
an inflow of foreign direct investment, in part through continued privaization.
3.           Achieving the objectives of private sector investment and sustained growth will require
the adoption of clear and consistent policy reforms supported by the Private Sector Development
Adjusmen Credit (PSDAC).  The PSDAC provides support for reforms in the financial sector
presentation and passage of banking and other financial sector legislation and restructuring and
privatizing state-owned institutions); restrucring and privatization of public enterprises, including bank
(privatization of majority and minority participation over a three-year period); and reforms in the business
environment and trade regime. The PSDAC has been appraised and is expected to be negotiated and
presented to the Board shortly after this project, in early 1995.
4.           The proposed Financil Sector and Business Environment Credit (ISBEC), seeks to
ensure that the above reform measures are carried out and implemented on a sustainable basis. The credit
would provide support for institutional strengthening in the above reform areas where institutions have
been found to be the weakest and where support is not provided or idenified. In deermining the areas
where IDA can have a catalytic effect, the following facts have been taken into account:
(i)  baning supervision began with IMF assistance in 1990 but needs sreng ing, in particular
to accommodate the wicer scope of institutions soon to be under the Bank of Guyana's (BOG)
purview under proposed legislation;
(ii) BOG monetar management has also received assistance from the IMF, and needs further
institutional strengthening and capacity building;
(iii) two sate-owned financial insttions (GNCB and GAIBANK) have faced isues regarding their
business mandates and financial viability, as well as their management and staffing procedures;



(iv) a privatDion unit established in late 1993, needs significant capacity to carry out its objectives
due to lack of staffing and operating procedures. Furdter strengthenng is required for the ability
to bring state-owned institutions to the point of sale for privatization;
(v)- the envirn tl =unit in the Office of the President is in the process of developing its own
objectives and regulatory capacity yet requires specialized epertise to assess the environmental
impact of individual companies to be privatized;
(vi) the embryonic investment promotion agency (GO-INVEST) which promotes and facilitates foreign
direct investment, requires substantial capacity building; and
(vii) implementing regulations are needed for the Companies Act; and the Regitry of Companies (in
the Deeds Registry Office) requires significant strengthening in order to effectively apply the Act.
Project Objectives
5.           The objectives of the project are to implement sustainable institution building mechanisms
supporting the financial and private sector, and to facilitate the effective implementation of policy
measures supported by the PSDAC. By the end of the three-year period, the following results aim to be
achieved, supported by this Credit and the PSDAC: (i) Strengthened regulation and supervision of
financial institutions to improve the solvency and efficiency of financial intermediation in Guyana, and
development of BOG open-market operations and foreign exchange trading, resulting in gains in market
efficiency. The Government has agreed that its capital in state-owned fiancial institutions could be put
to better alternative uses, therefore, state-owned finmcial institutions, including a merger between GNCB
and GAIBANK, and other public financial institutions, are planned to be brought to the point-of-sale for
transfer to the private sector in accordance with its strategy articulated in the PFP for 1994-1996; (ii) In
the same manner, as reflected in the Government's privatization strategy, a large majority of public
enterprises are earmarked for privatization, liquidation, or otherwise disposed of during the same period,
while in the process ensuring that any environmental risks associated with such enterprises are properly
identified a priori; and (iii) Foreign investment is expected to increase and will be encouraged by easier
information access and assistance in dealing with bureaucracy, through the Guyana Office Investment
(GO-INVEST). The business climate will also be improved by the application of the Companies Act
through regulations and institutional capacity building.
6.           The institutional strengthening measures supported are findamenl to achieving the
implementation of the policy reforms contemplated: The development of a sustainable framwork for
financial institution regulation and monetary management are fimdanental to providing a stable and
transparent enabling environment conducive to efficient resource mobilization for private investment.
Restrcturing and privatizing state-owned financial instiuxtions is vital to focusing the State's role on
activities more aptly under its purview. Facilitatng public enterprise privatization will enable a
transparent and equitable reallocation of State-owned assets to more efficient use. Strengthening
GO-INVEST will assist in providing clarity to foreign investors and influence the reduction in the barniers
to such investment. Similarly, strengthening the implementation of the Companies Act and the Registry
of Companies will remove a deterrent to transparent business transactions and encourage domestic
investment. Effective implementation capability in each of these reform areas will be criffcal in Guyana
in order to strengthen administrative capacity.
Project Description
7.           The project will achieve these three objectives through the following components. The
first component will seek to strengthen ) fnBcial sector operaton and regulton through: (a) support
to the Central Bank in banking supervision through regulatory advice, traiing and equpment; (b) support
to the Central Bank in improving monetary management through assistance in developing procedures and
related staff training; and (c) support in restructuring of stateowned financial institutions including GNCB



.3-
and its merger with GAIBANK, through advisors in credit policy, accounting systems, financial controls,
restructuring and rationalization (US$1.73 million). The second component seeks ,(H) throug
privaston, to transfer public ownership of a majority of public enterprises (including financial
institutions) to private hands and in this manner, to also stimulate investment. For this component.
support would be provided for: (a) Privatization Unit operations for public enterprise privatization (both
commercial entexprises and financial institutions) imcludg the development of prospectuses,
prequalification and privatization execution; and (b) support to the Office of the President (which has the
portfolio for Enviromnental Protection) through the financing of environmental audits of select public
enterprises (US$1.26 million). The third component aims to (ill) segthe the busns environnme
through (a) support to the Office of GO-INVEST with training of staff to help simplify procedures for
foreign investors, and (b) consultant support in the development of regulations under the Conmpanies Act
and training of staff of the Registry of Companies to strenghen its capacity to implement this Act
(US$0.68 million).
Projed Fhianoung
8.           The Credit would finance US$ 3.5 million equivalent (87% of total project costs of US$
4.0 million), including 100% of foreign exchange costs and the remaning US$ 0.5 million would be
financed by Govermment counterpart resources. The Govermment has been reserved about borrowing IDA
funds for institutional strengthening measures and, as a result, complementary financing has been actively
identified as follows:
*  Some of the studies in the preparatory phase have been financed by a Japanese Grant established
in connection with the PSDAC;
*  An earlier IDA Public Admlnistration Credit provides support, inter alia, for tax and customs
administration;
*  The U.K. OversesDeveloast Admin            has agreed in principle to finance a privatization
advisory firm in an initial phase and is considering select financing of environmental audits of
public enterprises;
•  The IMF has provided financing to the BOG in banking supervision and for a macroeconomic
advisor, and may also provide fimding for monetay management strengthening. IDA has worked
closely with the IMF in all aspects of the project, including, in particular, the strengthening of the
BOG;
*  Ongoing support is being provided by IDB in strengthening customs and tax administration;
*  A parallel IDB Technical Coopertion Fadifty (under preparation) would provide support for
institutional development in securities markets regulation, improvement in the financial management
of the National Insurance Fund (Social Security Fund), strengthenin of collateral and registry
procedures, and courses for commercial bank credit officers in investment and project financial
analysis; and
*  A USAJID facility will soon assist in developing implementation capacity of the Ministry of Finance
and the Ministry of Trade, and will also begin execution of a Judicial Reform project.
9.           Procurement would be according to normal IDA review procedures and disbursements
would be made against 100% of net-of-tax costs of local and foreign consultants, 100% of training
expenses, 100% of the CIF costs of imported goods and of the ex-factory cost of local goods and 85%
of the cost of locally-procured goods. For goods and consultant services below $25,000, disbursements
would be made against statements of expenditure. Goods and consultant service contracts at $25,000 and
above would be subject to prior review by IDA. At appraisal, it was detrined that no retroactive
financing would be required. A technical annex describes procurement and disbursement arrangements
for the proposed Credit. The Project is expected to be completed by end-1997 and the closing date wouild
be June 30, 1998.

Project Imlannato
10.          The Credit would be a techical assistance facility managed through a Project Unit to be
established in. the Ministry of Fine. The Project Unit would be responsible for coordinating the
requests from each of the counterpart agencies, ensurng that proper procurement procedures are followed
and overseeing the disbursement process& During appraisal, a procuremert specialist working with IDA,
established guidelines and requirements for the Project Unit to follow, including the use of a procurement
specialist for the purchase of equipment and contracting of consultants, as well as auditing and other
staffing requirements. The project iplenion period is expected to Last for a period of three
years-the period for policy reforms supported by the PSDAC. Project administration would be in close
coordination with potential U.K., IMP, and other parallel financing'. Performance under the project will
be measured against monitoring indicators agreed at negotiations.
Project Sustnabity
I1.          The project seeks to assist in initial measures in the development of strong, sustainable
Government institutions conducive to long-term private sector growth. An important measure taken to
ensure sustainability is the linkage of this credit to policy measures required under the PSDAC. While
there is no formal cross-conditionality between credits, monitoring indicators linked to policy reforms and
implementation of institutional strengdtning measures are reflected in the PSDAC tranche release
conditions and the corresponding Letter of Development Policy. Such measures include the maintenance
of a sound macroeconomic framework, presentation and passage of financial sector legislation and the
privatization of selected enterprises indicated in the PSDAC Policy Matrix. The project would not be
conditioned on approval of the PSDAC, since the project's components are essentially freestanding in that
ihey would permit the build-up of institutional capacity and sustainability of various key functions. Thus,
while it is anticipated that the PSDAC program will proceed as planned, any delays or developments to
the contrary would still provide justification for executing the FISBEC project.
12.          Sustainability beyond the three-year period supported by the Credit will be sought through
the following measures: (i) in banking supervision, a funding mechanism through fees and/or budgetary
allocations, whereby the Banking Supervision Department would be assured a reliable revenue base from
financial institutions (via bank supervision fees) to defray regulatory costs. Under this arrangement,
financial institutions would demand appropriate service for fees paid and thus provide an incentive for
responsiveness by the BOG. (ii) Currently, BOG has set out a long term budget plan for implementation
in BSD, consisting of a substanti staff complement to carry out and sustain its functions. In addition,
operating policies and procedures, including inspection manuals are to be developed to ensure continuity
and sustainability; (iii) improved salary guidelines for Central Bank employees would be implemented,
training underken, and revised operating procedures developed while cultivating a cadre of Central Bank
professionals; and (iv) the Office of GO-INVEST created to facilitate private investment would develop
expertise and sustainable institutional capacity by ultimately charging fees and/or ensuring a permanent
budget to carry out its services in the medium-term.  In the same way, it is anticipated that
implementation of the Companies Act of 1991 through a strengthened Registry of Conpanies will be
institutionalized through improved operating procedures and stronger staffing.
1. Cofinamig fom the above-mentioned soures is curcnty beig dicussed and is yet to be finalized. However. project fimding is not
dependent on such cofinammug, and sufficient lDh resources would be avalable to enst9t that all key actions hae fimacial support. if
other fimding does not matedalie.



-5-
13.          Three reform areas supported by the Credit are designed to only last through the
medium-term: (i) assistance in the restructuring of GNCB (and its merger with GAIBANK) is intended
to bring the institution to profitability, and reduce its large indebtedness to the government, and thereafter
to proceed with the privatization of the institution in line with the government's objectives in the financial
sector; (ii) measures to prepare other institutions for privatization are also intended within a three-year
period to place these institutionsm under private ownership, competitively operated and well-managed; and
(iii) the Privatization Unit should, in the medium-term, cease to exist as its mandate is fulfilled.
Ultimately the restructuring and privatization of public enterprises will lead to a transfer of ownership
to the private sector in a way which, when combined with other economic liberalization measures, will
lead to a process of market driven development.
Lessons Learned from Previous IDA InvOlveient
14.          The project has been designed to take into account the experience of previous IDA
operations in Guyana, including the Technical Assistance Credit (Cr-2169-GUA), the Public
Administration Program as well as the overall IBRD/1DA experience with respect to technical assistance
projects of this nature. IBRD/IDA-wide experience suggests that: (i) regulatory reform and institutional
strengthening need to be supported by an adequate macroeconomic policy enviromnent; (ii) operations
shoula be designed within a broad sectoral context, including a medium-term strategy for sustainabiity;
(iii) project design should include a realistic assessment of the implementation capacity of counterpart
agencies; (iv) technical assistance design should be preceded by carefil analysis of institutional factors,
including borrower commitment and borrowers should be closely involved from the earliest phases of
preparatione; (v) projects should be focused and limited in breadth and size so as to facilitate achievable
objectives; (vi) projects should have well-defined loan admiistation/financing arrangements; and (vii)
projects should include verifiable indicators of performance.
15.          The issues above have been addressed as follows: (i) the project is supported by
macroeconomic policy conditions specified in the PSDAC and the IMF ESAF; (ii) the operation has been
designed in a sectoral context, including a separate report on private sector development which included
a thorough analysis of the financial sector; (iii) the project design has established mechanisms to
overcome limited counterpart project implementation capacity. The project will aim to remedy delays
in project implementation noted in other projects in Guyana and difficulties with procurement through
the staffing and operational guidelines of the project unit; (iv) the project concept was jointly developed
by IDA and Government authorities after analysis of the objectives and institutional constrais to private
sector development; (v) the Borrower has had considerable input into project objectives and design from
initial project identification; (vi) the project is limited in scope and size to perform focused
implementation; (vii) loan administration/financing arrangements have been defned and agreed-upon with
the Borrower; and (viii) an implementation plan was agreed upon at negotiations.
Rationale for IDA Involvement
16.          Support of institutional strengthening is essential to carrying through the policy reform
measures supported by the PSDAC. IDA provides a critical catalyt. function through its support of these
policy reforms and the linkage between these reforms and the instiutional capacity to implement them.
The objectives of the Credit are critical to the agreed-upon country assistance strategy whereby IDA
would focus measures which it supports in Guyana, towards private sector development and social sector
improvement. Finally, IDA offers institutional expertise (in accordance with the PSDAC) in finnncial
institution regulation, state-bank restructuring, privatiztion-and tax reform, which are of importance to
2.    See Operations Policy Oepartnent, Handbook on Technical Assisance, The World Bank, 1993, pp. 33.41.



-6-
GuyanYs development program. Thus, the proposed project is fily consistent with the Bank's country
assistance strategy dated November 24, 1993 (contied in Report P-6155.GUA).
Agreed Actions
17.          During negotiations, agreements were confirmed concerning: (i) mechanisms to ensure
compliance with counterpart financing requiments and the establishment of a project administration unit;
(ii) the Inplementation Plan in the form of key project activities (Implementation Letter), including
objectives, scope of work tasks, outputs, instiutional arrangements, projet timetables, implemention
plans, performance indicators, and milestones; (iii) a condition of disbursements for the financing of
project activities for the GNCBtGAIBANK component after the merger of the two institutiQns has been
completed and a new entity created, (iv) the privatization work for other state-owned financial institutions
to be coordinated under the Privatization Unit, and (v) financing of the loan recovery unit (during its
existence) with counterpart funds. Credit effectiveness will be conditioned on the establishment of a
project unit, and appointment of the head of the unit.
UNiromnental Aspects
18.          While the project is not expected to present significant environmental risks, IDA has
recommended a "B" environment rating because of the environmental audits for public enterprises
financed by the project. An assessment of environmental regulation performed by IDA indicated that
improvement in regulation of environmental issues is currently underway with support in the drafting of
legislation by the US Environmental Protection Agency and with institutional strengthening supported by
IDB through UNDP.
Progam Objective Categories
19.          The project would contribute to the financial intemeiation, private sector development
and institutional development categories.
Participatory Approach
20.          In order to ensure participation and ownership of the project by the executing emities and
beneficiaries, several actions have been taken as part of the project implementation strategy including (i)
undertaking an extensive public awareness campaign especialy with respect to privatization issues and
to evoke public participation, (ii) ensuring utilization of local skills in most project components, both for
cost-effectiveness reasons as well as to promote long-term sustainability, (iii) involving the borrower in
developing incentive mehanisms to retain local staff once they have taken up responsibilities for
managing specified project components (e.g.: in bankdng supervision and foreign direct investment
promotion), and (iv) including a structured training component managed by supervisors under the
respective project components, in order to assure ownership and establish sustainable functions to be
executed by local staff.
Project Benefits
21.          The principal benefit of this Credit would be the initiation of a process of realizing
sustainable results from the reforms supported by the PSDAC: (a) financial sector reform, (b)
privatization and (c) strengthening the business emironment. The benefit of improved financild sector



-7-
regulation and of restructuring and privatization of state-owned financial institutions, would be increased
solvency of financial institutions, and efficiency of financial intermediation. Privatization is expected to
yield revenues to the Goven.ment of some 25% of GDP, not including the sugar company which could
yield an additional 10% of GDP. Such capital could be redeployed to better use. Further, most public
enterprises are starved for capital and privatization is expected to yield significant additional invesument
which otherwise could not be mobilized. Full development of GO-INVEST would ease infonration costs
for investors and thus mobilize additional investment. Improvement in the administration of the Registry
of Companies should improve the business environment in such a way as to facilitate greater business at
lower cost.
22.          Measurement of benefits will be through the assessment of. (i) the improvement in the
substance of banking regulation tirough the issuance of revised regulations, more in-depth and improved
inspections, and improved offsite financial analysis; (ii) strengthening of monetary managemen through
the development of improved monetary policy tools in accordance with the IMF program established as
well as development of improved analytical, policy design, statistical gathering and processing
capabilities; (iii) effective restructuring of state-owned banks (GNCB and GAIBANK into a merged entity)
in terms of meeting the objectives set out in the action plan; (iv) effectiveness of the privatization unit
in preparing public enterprises (including financial institutions) for privatization, and in privatizing such
institutions so as to lead to a sustainable path of private sector driven development; (v) effectiveness of
the Office of GO-INVEST as measured by the demand for its services and its ability to deliver these
services on a cost-effective basis; and (vi) effectiveness of Registry of Companies as measured by the
implementation of the Companies Act.
Project Risks
23.          Principal project risks are: (i) the Government may not continue its adherence to a strong
macroeconomic program so that the impact of institutional reform measures is overshadowed by potential
elements of macroeconomic istability; (ii) the Government may not undertake the policy reform
measures supported by the PSDAC or such reforms may not become implemented in the future and thus
the technical assistance will not have the desired impact; (iii) the Government may not on all fronts,
provide the support and take the requisite institution-building measures concerning staffing, salaries, other
resources and counterpart funds-the latter could lead to weak results and threaten a sustainable impact;
and (iv) in spite of a commitment to recruit local staff and consutat, an inability to recruit effective
personnel, given linitations in the pool of silled professionals in Guyana.
24.          These risks are being addressed as follows: (i) lack of adherence to a strong
macroeconomic program would trigger non-compliance with tranche release conditions of the PSDAC.
Moreover, the indicators monitored in the matrix of Key Project Activities would suggest perfarmance
problems providing leverage to limit disbursement.  On the positive side, it is expected that the
momentum of measures since the ERP in 1988 will lead the Government to maintain a firm and solid
macroeconomic program; (ii) similarly, halting the undertaking of policy reform measures in the financial
sector, in privatization, and in the business environment as supported under this credit, would trigger
non-compliance with tranche release conditions of the PSDAC (including conditions requiring
inmplementation of laws and regulations). Again, it is anticipated that there will be positive synergies,
between policy reform measures and institutional strengthening; (iii) up-front agreements on staffing,
salaries and counterpart contributions (indicated above) will seek to initiate a commitment that will
mitigate against the risk that the Govermnent's promise towards institution-building would wane. More
important is the expectation that the Government will develop a stake in, and increasingly a belief in the
policies and institution-building measures as being in its best interests; and (iv) difficulties in recruiting
staff will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis. Since the ability to attract qualified personnel (including
overseas Guyanese) is a function of salary and other incentives, salary guidelines for the key agencies
need to be established.
