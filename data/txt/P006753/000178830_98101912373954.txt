1. THE SECTOR 1/
Energy Resources
1.01      Colombia's main indigenous commercial energy resources are hydro-
power, coal, gas and oil. Potential hydropower appears to be the most promis-
ing at some 100 GW of capacity and 250-300 TWh of annual energy capability,
as shown by the preliminary investigations made by the Government with
technical assistance from the Federal Republic of Germany.
1.02      Colombia is also endowed with very large coal and gas deposits.
Crude oil output has declined since 1971 at an average rate of 7.5%/a.
Over the same period, consumption has increased by 7%/a. As a result, Colombia
is now a net importer of crude oil (it was a net exporter until 1976) and pros-
pects are for these imports to rise sharply to onerous levels by the early 1980s
unless additional reserves are discovered and developed quickly. Measures are
being taken (1.05) to deal with this problem and to develop alternative energy
sources. In the case of coal, there have been various obstacles to more adequate
utilization of the existing potential: prices as low as one-fifth of those
prevailing on international markets, the competition of low-priced petroleum,
fragmentation of production among a large number of very small mines with low
output and productivity levels, and lack of efficient marketing and transport
infrastructure. However, the Government is currently taking action to address
these problems, and large-scale development of coal reserves is planned (1.04).
With respect to natural gas, a previous decline in known reserves and output has
been dramatically reversed with the discovery of large deposit5 in the Atlantic
Coast region. These reserves (estimated at over 5 trillion ft ) will provide
energy and petrochemical feedstock to this rapidly industrializing region.
1.03      Output of primary energy during 1965-75 has not kept pace with
overall economic expansion. It increased only 1.7%/a during 1965-70 when it
reached its peak at 657 trillion Btu, and declined since then to 625 trillion
Btu in 1975, mainly due to falling crude oil output:

In contrast to the declining energy output, domestic consumption has grown by
5.4%/a during 1965-70, and 8.5%/a during 1971-73, when economic growth was
high and energy prices declined sharply in real terms. During 1974-76, the
economic down-turn and increase in real energy prices had a dampening effect
on consumption, which now has settled at a growth of about 4.5%/a compared
with a GDP growth of some 6% in recent years.
1/   The difference between primary energy output and final energy consumption,
expressed in heat equivalent, constitutes the approximate sum of total
losses and exports.
2/   Calculated at:  11,100 Itu/kWh for power, 5.6 MBtu/bbl for oil and its
products, 1 MBtu/10 ft for gas and its products and 28.69 MBtu/t for
coal and coke.



-3-
1.04      The Government's development strategy is aimed at achieving a more
favorable balance between domestic energy supply and use, thus utilizing more
fully those energy sources which are in abundant supply, i.e., hydropower,
natural gas and coal. The Government is planning a large-scale development of
coal deposits by state entities in association with foreign investors. For
that purpose, a new enterprise, CARBOCOL, has recently been created and is
likely to emerge as the Government's chief agency in coal-related matters.
The Government attaches high priority to developing the thermal coal deposits
at El Cerrejon (near Riohacha in the department of La Guajira on the Atlantic
coast) under CARBOCOL's responsibility. An exploration contract has been
concluded with the Exxon subsidiary INTERCOR, covering part of the coal field;
the remaining section is planned to be developed by CARBOCOL itself or by
foreign companies on the basis of special contracts. Reserves are believed
to be as high as 600 million tons and the combined capacity of both ventures
is estimated at about 10 Mt/a. On the other hand, small private firms which
own coal mines are pursuing plans to expand output in order to supply fuel
for heat intensive industrial processes and in-plant power generation. In
order to expand potentially viable mines, a well-coordinated Government
program is needed to provide a more rational price structure and improve
mine safety, credit facilities and support for marketing and infrastructure.
Such a program would need substantial technical and capital assistance from
abroad.
1.05      In the hydrocarbon sector, the Government has taken action to stimu-
late investment in exploration and field development, which had declined after
1971 because of unrealistically low prices applied to domestic sales. The
Government is encouraging foreign participation in exploration and development
on the basis of association contracts with ECOPETROL (the Government oil
agency). The prices paid for oil produced by increasing yields from existing
fields and from new fields have been raised, the latter now being close to
world market levels, and the discriminatory exchange rate for petroleum has
been eliminated. As a result, interest among foreign petroleum companies to
expand or start operations in Colombia has been intensified and a significant
up-turn in exploration is expected. In order to explore more adequately
Colombia's sedimentary basins, outlays of close to US$1 billion appear to be
necessary through the early 1980s, with another US$2 billion required for
developing possible fields. ECOPETROL is also studying the possibility of
increasing the output of existing fields through secondary recovery techniques.
1.06      Plans are underway to explore the country's uranium potential and
the Government has concluded an exploration contract with the French Minatome
group. The development of any uranium potential that might exist would
provide the country with another long-term energy option.
Power Supply
1.07      Electricity is the fastest growing form of energy use in Colombia;
its share in overall energy consumption has grown from 14% in 1960 to 24% in
1975. This process has been assisted by the gradual consolidation of isolated
facilities into regional systems and the interconnection of these systems to
facilitate development of Colombia's low-cost hydro resources. The main
systems are (see Map 3948) the Central System, covering the interior and the



- 4 -
Pacific coast, and the Atlantic (or Northern) System covering the northern
part of the country. The proposed San Carlos Hydro Project will be located
in the Central Sytem; the 500-kV Interconnection Project will interconnect
these systems. Public electricity service is presently provided by:
(a)  municipally-owned companies, independent of the Central
Government, of which the largest are Empresa de Energia
Electrica de Bogota (EEEB), Empresas Publicas de Medellin
(EPM) and Empresas Municipales de Cali (EMCALI);
(b)  national enterprises such as Instituto Colombiano de Energia
Electrica (ICEL), the Corporacion Autonoma Regional del
Cauca (CVC), and the Corporacion Electrica de la Costa
Atlantica (CORELCA);
(c)  a large number of local subsidiaries of ICEL, CORELCA and
CVC 1/; and
(d)  a generating and transmission company, Interconnexion
Electrica S.A. (ISA).
E]EEB, EPM, ICEL, CVC and CORELCA are the major shareholders of ISA which would
be the borrower for the San Carlos I Project and would construct, own and
operate the 500-kV Interconnection Project to be financed by the Government
(which would be the borrower for the latter project). Colombia has a number
o:E public entities known as Regional Autonomous Corporations with a range of
functions relaited to development of the regions under their jurisdiction,
including legaL capacity to generate, transmit and distribute electricity.
CVIC is the largest of these entities. IBRD Map 3948 shows the service areas
of the major retailers; further details on the major utilities are given in
Chapter 2.
Regulation
1.08      Through its Electric Energy Division, the Ministry of Mines and
Energy is charged with formulating a national policy for the generation,
transmission and distribution of electricity.  This division, which is being
organized, was also given the responsibility for coordinating and supervising
power sector planning. However, it does not have the powers assigned to
similar agencies in other countries (issuance of licenses, regulation of
tariffs, approval of expansion programs) to enforce its policies and program.
1.09      The Ministry of Mines and Energy owns a part of the sector directly
(through ICEL and CORELCA). EEEB and EPM (presently the largest power utilities)
are controlled by autonomous municipal governments. CVC reports to the
National Planning Department (NPD) as do other regional development corporations
which may, as already noted, undertake power projects.
1/   In most cases the ownership of these subsidiaries is shared with local
governments.



- 5 -
1.10      Public utility retail tariffs (including those for electricity) are
regulated by the Junta Nacional de Tarifas de Servicios Publicos in the NPD,
which has customarily approved requests for rate increases. However, utilities
are free to set tariffs at levels lower than those approved by the Junta and
have done so in the past.
1.11      ISA was established to provide a rational framework for sector
expansion by interconnecting the systems of its shareholders, thus creating
a national grid capable of sustaining large hydroelectric developments. By
pooling their financial resources through ISA, its shareholders have been able
to undertake much larger and more economical projects than would have been
feasible under the previous arrangements. However, ISA is still in the process
of growing into a strong national utility. The municipal utilities have been
reluctant to relinquish their role in generation and have experienced severe
financial constraints which reduced the availability of funds to ISA. Decisions
on system expansion have required protracted negotiations among the shareholders
and the Government, further complicated by the original shareholders' reluctance
to allow the incorporation of CORELCA into ISA. Throughout these
negotiations, the Bank continued to support the concept of centralized planning,
construction and operation of the national grid and has resisted proposals that
would weaken ISA. Because of the time required by the shareholders to arrive
at decisions on these fundamental issues, Bank consideration of San Carlos I,
the 500-kV Interconnection and EEEB's proposed Mesitas hydroelectric project,
all of them urgently needed to avoid power rationing in Colombia (3.07)
suffered considerable delays. A compromise solution was evolved in extensive
discussions between Bank staff, the Government and the shareholders over the
past eighteen months. In addition to the financial measures detailed in
Chapter 6, revisions have been introduced into ISA bylaws which specify that ISA
would define the future generation expansion program in the interconnected system.
ISA would own plants requiring the joint effort of all its shareholders. Plants
of regional interest may be built by one or several shareholders, subject to ISA
approval of such regional plants. Under this arrangement, ISA would, in effect,
be responsible for an important part of sector regulation and planning; only
utilities which do not participate directly in ISA and the regional development
corporations other than CVC, would not be covered by its decisions. Voting
arrangements in ISA have been restructured to require the concurrence of four
of its five major shareholders in all important decisions, thus protecting the
interests of the municipal utilities and encouraging a more positive participa-
tion in its deliberations.
World Bank Participation in the Sector
1.12      Since 1950, the Bank has made 18 loans to Colombia's power sector,
totalling MUS$350 (see Annex 1.1). Sixteen loans have assisted the expansion
of capacity in the systems of Bogota, Medellin, Cali, Cartagena, Bucaramanga,
and Manizales. The most recent loan (874 CO, 1973) included expansion of
of electricity distribution in low income areas and the Bank is currently
supporting rural electrification under the Integrated Rural Development
Project (1352-CO, 1977). The general reviews of Bank lending in the power

sector and in Colombia prepared by the Operations Evaluation Division (OED)
of the Programming and Budgeting Department 1/ contained a detailed analysis
of early Bank activities in the Colombian power sector. The main findings
of Lhese reports were _ddressed to general issues of Bank policy in the
power sector. A further report of OED 2/ has summarized the actions taken
by the Bank on these recommendations.
1.13      The recommendations specifically addressed to further loans in the
Colombian power sector include the need to give greater attention to power
distribution; the improvement of financial recording and financial planning
capabilities; and the need to give more attention to public utility tariff
structures. These concerns have influenced the Bank's work in the sector
(1.16, 1.20, 1.30, 6.05, 6.13, 6.18). However, priority attention has had to
be given to 3 issues on which satisfactory progress was expected when the last
loan was made: sector planning, organization and financing (1.11, 1.26-1.34).
Performance uncer recent loans for power in Colombia (which have all been made
to ISA and its shareholders) is discussed in Chapter 2.
1.14      The two proposed loans, totalling MUS$176 (one to ISA, amounting to
MUS$126 million for construction of the first stage of the San Carlos hydro
station and one to the Government amounting to MUS$50 for the 500-kV Intercon-
nection system) are urgently needed to avoid possible energy rationing in
Colombia from 1981 onward, which would have serious consequences for the
country's economy. These projects would increase ISA's role substantially
since it would control the national interconnection system and, upon completion
of the second stage of San Carlos (1984), would own 35% of the country's total
generating capacity.
Power Market
1.15      Electricity generation in Colombia expanded by an average of 9.7%/a
over the period 1960-70 and then decreased to about 8.6% on average until the
end of 1976 due to the slackening in industrial growth after 1974 (industrial
consumption decreased to 7.4%/a compared with 9.5%/a during the sixties).
Present per capita electricity generation is estimated at about 600 kWh, which
is below average for Latin America. Installed capacity at the end of 1976 was
3,300 MW, including self-production. Hydro stations accounted for 68% of total
energy generation.

-7-
1.16      Colombia has about 1.84 million electricity subscribers in an esti-
mated total population of 24.2 million; 87% of these subscribers are residen-
tial, and electricity service reaches 60% of the population. Studies by the
Bank's Development Policy Staff indicate that Colombia has been able to
provide electriciLy service to a very high proportion of its urban population
(85%, with the connection rate exceeding 98% in the larger cities). However,
only 16% of rural families had service in 1974. Of the electrified municipal-
ities, 88% have continuous service, while the other 12% have service only
during certain hours of the day. Also, in many towns the quality of the
service is unsatisfactory because of lack of maintenance.
1.17      Residential consumers were responsible for the largest share of
electricity sales by the major utilities in 1976, followed by industry:

1.18     Public utilities accounted for 93% of total electricity supply; the
rest was provided by self-production.  EEEB generated 26%, EPM 25% and CVC,
ICEL and CORELCA about 13% each. Self-suppliers (mainly oil refineries,
petro-chemical plants, steel mills and cement works) owned 5.8% of the country's
installed capacity; these plants are also connected to the public electricity
service. The public-service labor force totalled 13,358 at the end of 1976,
including 6,663 manual workers; this gives ratios of 233 kW/employee and 138
subscribers/employee, which compare favorably with the average for Latin
America. The following table summarizes (Annex 1.2) installed capacity and

Rural Electrification
1.19      About 30% of the population live in areas classified as rural.
Most of the rural villages with electricity service are close to the urban



centers. In 1974 only 16% of the rural population had electricity service.
It is estimated that the cost of a rural electrification network, for the
country as a whole, would be about US$500 per household and that over a
p. iod of six years electricity could be brought to about 20% of the rural
population presently without service (about 40,000 dwellings a year) at a
cost of some MUS$120.
1.20      Rural electrification programs are currently under way in a number
of regions in the country. Among the most important are (a) the electrifica-
tion subproject of the 1977-79 Integrated Rural Development Program supported
by IDB, Canadian International Developement Agency and Bank financing
(Loan 1352-CO); (b) the electrification program in the department of Choco
financed by the Netherlands Government); and (c) the electrification program
in the coffee-growing areas, financed by coffee sector resources.
Sector Investment Program and Studies
1.21      Investment in generation and transmission facilities during 1977-84
is expected to amount to about Col$250 billion in current prices (about US$5
billion in 1976 prices), some 60% of which would be in foreign exchange. The
investments in distribution are only partially known (for EEEB and EPM amount-
ing to some Col$22 billion) because details are not available for the subsi-
diaries of CVC, CORELCA, ICEL and the smaller entities. A master plan for
power development to be prepared by ISA (1.24) would provide such information.
1.22      The jprogram of investments in generation and transmission includes,
im addition to the projects already decided upon by the Government and ISA's
shareholders (4.01), the start of construction of projects that will form part
of the 1984-90 expansion program. ISA has recently submitted to the Bank
a study 1/ indicating that the 1984-88 portion of this program would be the
least-cost alternative for system expansion. Thermal plant should be analyzed
in detail to establish location, unit sizes, fuels and other technical aspects.
In addition, since additional thermal plant will be required mainly to provide
r-eserves for the interconnected system, thus benefitting all utilities connected
to the grid, proposals for sharing investment and operating costs and agreement
oni dispatch responsibilities must be worked out soon (3.09 and 4.02). The
Bank expects to review these issues with ISA in the course of the preparation
of- the generation projects which would follow San Carlos I and Mesitas.
1.23      The study described above was undertaken by ISA in view of the
delays encountered in the execution of a more comprehensive study which the
Government decided to carry out when the Bank made its last loan for power in
Colombia (874-CO for the Guatape II project - 1973). ISA is cooperating in
the comprehensiLve survey of hydro resources included in the study (1.32) and
1/' Programa cle Expansion del Sistema Interconectado-Periodo 1984-1988 (ISA,
Junio 197,7).



- 9 -
a long-term expansion program based on the survey's findings is expected to
be available in mid-1979. The Government agreed to present this portion
of the study to the Bank for review not later than September 30, 1979.
1.24      In order to improve the allocation of resources between the various
categories of investment which the power sector will have to carry out,
ISA and its shareholders agreed to prepare and present to the Government and
the Bank for comments by December 31, 1979, a Power Sector Development Master
Plan. This plan would cover the period 1980-90 in detail and 1991-2000 in
general terms and consolidate the programs for generation and transmission.
Similarly ISA's shareholders have agreed, under coordination of the Ministry
of Mines and Energy, to prepare and present, as part of ISA's, Master Plan, to
the Government and the Bank for comments, by December 31, 1979 a Sector
Development Master Plan for Distribution for the period 1980-2000, which would
consolidate all existing and future programs for distribution; the period
1980-85 would be covered in detail. The Master Plan would overall provide a
valuable framework for long-range decisions on sector financing, pricing and
rural electrification which are presently being based on partial and
uncoordinated information.
1.25      The generation investment program will impose a heavy financial
burden on ISA and its shareholders. To ensure that only sound projects are
undertaken, assurances have been obtained that ISA and its shareholders would
not undertake construction of any generating plant or combination of plants
of more than respectively 200 MW (ISA) and 100 MW (shareholders) capacity
prior to completion of the proposed San Carlos I Project unless satisfactory
evidence has been presented to the Bank that it is economically justified and
that adequate financing is available to carry it out without jeopardizing the
proposed Project.
Finances and Tariffs
1.26      The power sector has relied heavily on borrowings and budgetary
contributions to finance its investments. EEEB and EPM, which operate low-
cost systems, have received a large share of the borrowings and have been able
to charge low rates in their service areas, which cover the most affluent
markets in the country. CVC, ICEL and CORELCA, which operate high-cost systems,
have had to rely on budgetary contributions from the Government and subsidies,
despite their higher rates.
1.27      Rate adjustments have lagged considerably behind yearly inflation;
for 1971-1976 the developments were the following:

1973                0.243        10.2         22.0           0.157
1974i               0.277        14.2          25.2          0.143
1975                0.355        28.2         23.6           0.148
1976                0.423        19.2         20.0           0.147
Over the period, average rates increased only by about 13%/a, while inflation
averaged 19%.  Thus, the 1976 average revenue - at prices of 1970 - was equiva-
lent to only Col$0.147/kWh (73% of the 1970 average revenue of Col$0.202/kWh).
Despite recent increases the current rates are among the lowest in the world.
Residential consumers in Medellin pay from one-tenth to one-fifth of the price
charged to the average consumers in the rest of Latin America. This is the
principal reason for the per capita residential consumption in that city being
among the highest in the region.
1.28      The lag of adequate rate. increases, particularly until 1975 (as can
be observed in the above table, rate increases in 1975-77 have about kept pace
with inflation), appears to have been attributable mainly to the Government's
concern with the impact of energy prices on overall cost of living and the
pressures of local and regional interests. In view, however, of its extremely
low cost to the average consumer, the price of electricity is a marginal con-
tributor to the cost of living and the problem appears to have been mainly
political. The favorable trend in rate setting which began in 1975, is
expected to continue with gradual increases in real terms (see Chapter 6 for
the agreements reached with ISA and its shareholders). In view of the
importance to economic growth of adequate electricity service, the Government
has adopted a policy calling for adequate rates in order to ensure that
the sector generates internally a reasonable portion of the funds required.
1.29      In order to increase the contribution of power sector consumers to
the financing of its investment program, the Minister of Mines and Energy
submitted legislation to Congress in late 1976 creating a National Energy Fund.
The Fund would be financed by a surcharge on power tariffs and would be used
to finance rural electrification (25%) and projects approved by ISA and the
Ministry of Mines and Energy (75%). The Fund was expected to raise a modest
amount of resources for the sector (on the order of US$25 million annually)
and to increase the role of the Ministry of Mines and Energy in shaping
sector development. However, largely as a result of opposition from municipal
authorities to the basic objectives of the legislation, its enactment appears
doubtful at this time.

1.30      As pointed out by OED, 1/ the greatest distortion in retail tariffs
results from the low level of residential rates noted above. To address this
problem, ISA's shareholders agreed to carry out, coordinated by the Ministry
of Mines and Energy, a study of the cost of service to final consumers and its
implications fr_- power pricing, in the following major markets: Bogota,
Medellin, Cali and Barranquilla, under conditions and terms of reference
satisfactory to the Bank. The study, which also includes the area covered by
the rural electrification component of Loan 1352-CO, would be completed not
later than December 31, 1978 and its recommendations (together with the views
of the Ministry) would be discussed with the Bank not later than June 30,
1979.
1.31      The implementation of the agreed recommendations of the tariff
structure study would be a major objective of further Bank lending in the
sector.
Constraints on Sector Development
1.32      In the past, the large number of entities associated with the power
sector, the lack of adequate regulation, coordination and planning at the
national level and low electricity rates have contributed to the poor perform-
ance of the sector in making rational use of Colombia's abundant hydroelectric
resources. The regionalized nature of the sector, reflecting the political
and economic decentralization of Colombia, led to a lack of technical coopera-
tion and difficulties in coordinating investment allocation; decisions were
made on a local basis without due regard to overall country planning for power
development. This, together with the lack of funds, resulted in uneconomic
use of fuel and caused recurring power shortages, a problem that will not be
solved before well into the early eighties, provided the agreed development
program is implemented expeditiously (the latter in turn, being largely
dependent on adequate rate setting). In an effort to address the sector
problems, the Government indicated in 1973, when the Bank made its previous
loan for power (Guatape II, Loan 874-CO), that it planned to carry out with
the assistance of consultants a study of the sector covering its institutional
and financial problems and its long-term expansion program. The study, for
which assistance was obtained from the Federal Republic of Germany, is being
executed by two groups of German consultants. The first of these, working
with NPD, concentrated on sector institutions and financing. The Government
would present this report to the Bank by June 30, 1978. The second group of
consultants is working with ISA on a hydro survey and long-term expansion plan
(1.23).
1.33      The Government has recently taken a number of positive measures
to address the sector's institutional constraints. In 1975 it eliminated the
jurisdictional overlap between ICEL and CORELCA on the Atlantic Coast by
transferring control over the electricity distribution companies in that
region to CORELCA. Another positive measure was the reorientation of ICEL,
1/   Report No. Z-17, pages 59-63 (1.12) contains an analysis of tariff structure
problems in Bogota.



- 12 -
which in future will be responsible basically for electricity development in
rural and semi-rural areas, where the Government will continue to subsidize
the service since it cannot be financially self-supporting in those areas. 1/
-order to remedy Lhe problems that exist between the generating and dis-
tributing companies in the Cauca Valley as a consequence of the complex
organization of electricity service in that region, the Government has
supported the establishment of a regional power company whose basic function
w:ill be to consolidate that region's electricity sector in a single enterprise
(2.14). With the incorporation of CORELCA into ISA, most of the sector is
represented directly or indirectly 2/ in ISA's Board and a better coordina-
t:ion of power sector planning in Colombia will now be possible.  ISA's effec-
tiveness in achieving this coordination, however, will depend on its ability
to sustain the consensus developed over the past 2 years among its shareholders.
1/   The sector's organization fragmentation has to date precluded the usual
practice of deriving resources from well-developed urban markets to
support service in rural areas (1.26). The proposed National Energy Fund
(1.29) would, if approved, make this type of cross-subsidization feasible.

2.  ISA AND ITS SHAREHOLDERS
The Borrowers
2.01      The borrower for the San Carlos I Hydro Power Project would be
Interconexion Electrica S.A. (ISA). ISA would also construct, own and operate
the 500-kV Interconnection Project; this is highly desirable to ensure cen-
tralized operation of the national grid. Because of the high priority which
it attached to the fuel savings arising from the project and in view of the
fact that CORELCA would be the principal initial beneficiary, the Government
decided to finance the entire local cost of the project (CORELCA has always
relied on the Government for such financing) and proposed that CORELCA should
opwn the facilities. Te Bank suggested, for the reasons noted above, that IDA
be the owner. This was accepted by the Government; however, it did not wish
to reverse its prior decision that it should be the borrower for the foreign
loans (including the proposed Bank and KFW loans) for the project and that
ISA and its shareholders should not be required to assume any financial
obligations in connection with it. The Bank agreed, in view of the measures
adopted by CORELCA and other ISA shareholders to strengthen their finances and
carry out their large investment program while reducing CORELCA and CVC's
dependence on budgetary resources in the future. The Republic of Colombia
would thus be the borrower for the 500-kV Interconnection Project.
ISA
2.02      Bylaws.  ISA is a public corporation established in 1967.  Its share-
holders (with their holdings as of March 1978) are:

As already noted in 1.11, ISA's bylaws give it many regulatory and planning
functions. They also contain important provisions with regard to the financing
of the major generation projects entrusted to ISA which are detailed in
Chapter 6. The bylaws are consistent with the decentralized structure of
the power sector; when taken together with the agreements for the proposed
loans, they would provide a basis for improved sector performance. ISA
has agreed to secure the assent of the Bank before amendments are introduced
in the bylaws.



- 14 -
2.03      Organization and Administration.  ISA is administered by its
Shareholder Assembly, a 5-member Board of Directors and a General Manager.
The Assembly must act on all major issues, and decision-making is slow as
the interests of the various shareholders may differ. To ensure that decisions
are based on a consensus, ISA's bylaws specify that the decisions of the Share-
holders Assembly require the concurrence of 75% of the shares.
2.04      The General Manager, who is appointed by the Board of Directors for
a 2-year term, renewable indefinitely, is in charge of the day-to-day manage-
ment of the company. He is assisted by the chiefs of four departments
(Technical, Operations, Finance and Administration). ISA's organization
is adequate (Aknnex 2.1). With the help of consultants, it has handled well
the technical and administrative aspects of the 230-kV interconnection and
Chivor I, and is not expected to encounter problems in implementing the
proposed projects. ISA's transmission facilities are being operated satis-
factorily and operation of Chivor I is proceeding smoothly. Financial planning
is expected to improve following the recent creation of the Finance Department.
[SA's main off-ice has recently been transferred from Bogota to Medellin, a
consequence of the Government's decentralization policy.  The transfer should
prove generally advantageous, as ISA 's major projects for the foreseeable
future will be closer to Medellin than to Bogota.
2.05      Employment and Training.  ISA's staff is sufficiently large (about
500 people) and experienced to handle its responsibilities and its pay levels
are satisfactory.  ISA has a satisfactory training program at various national
institutions (technical schools) offering different levels of training.
2.06      Accounting and Auditing.  ISA's accounting and data processing
systems are good. Its monthly financial statements are produced promptly and
contain the required data. ISA is reorganizing its internal auditing office
to ensure that its auditing procedures keep pace with the company's growth.
2.07      Until 1975, ISA's annual financial statements were audited by
independent external auditors acceptable to the Bank. In compliance with
Government regulations, ISA's financial statements for 1976 and subsequent
years will be audited by the Office of the Comptroller of the Republic.
However, because this audit does not satisfy the Bank's requirements, the
financial statements for 1976 have also been audited by an independent auditor,
Cuellar, Feged & Co., which is satisfactory. ISA agreed that independent
auditors acceptable to the Bank, will continue to be used and that audited
financial statements, together with a detailed auditor's report, will be
submitted to the Bank within 4 months of the end of each financial year.
2.08      Insurance.  ISA's transmission facilities are insured in accordance
with normal utility practice. ISA agreed to take out appropriate insurance
for the Chivor I project by June 30, 1978.
2.09      Prior Bank Lending.  ISA has received two Bank loans totalling
MUS$70.3. The first (Loan 575-CO for MUS$18) was made. in 1968 to finance part
of the foreign cost of the 230-kV interconnection project, which linked ISA's
original shareholders, and a series of hydroelectric studies. The intercon-
nection was completed in 1972 at a cost below the appraisal estimate and the
Bank agreed that the savings could be used to finance the 230-kV Guatape-
Barrancabermeja transmission line.  Studies of the Cauca and Saldana rivers



- 15 -
were respectively completed by Integral (Colombia) and Compania de Estudios
e Interventorias (CEI, Colombia); a feasibility study of the Sogamoso hydro-
electric project was carried out by the consortium Hidroestudios (Colombia)-
Harza (US); a prefeasibility study of projects on the Guavio river was carried
out by Ingetec 'Colombia); similarly a study of projects in the Rio Sinu basin
in the Atlantic region was completed by the Consorcio Alto Sinu (Colombia)-
Chas. T. Main (US). As a result of these studies a project on the Guavio
river (1,300 MW) and 2 on the Rio Sinu (Urra I, 340 MW; Urra II, 710 MW) have
been identified and included in ISA's long term development program.
2.10      The second loan (681-CO for MUS$52.3) was made in 1970 to finance
part of the foreign cost of the 500-MW Chivor I hydroelectric project, ISA's
first power station. The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) made a MUS$35
loan for the project, and is providing MUS$48.5 in financing for Chivor II,
which would add a further 500 MW capacity for operation in 1980. Chivor I was
completed in mid-1977, two years behind schedule, with a cost overrun of approx-
imately MUS$86 (75%). The delay was due mainly to a contractor defaulting oLn
construction targets (and being replaced) and to geological problems encoun-
tered during construction of the project's dam and tunnel. The cost overruns
resulted from these problems and from higher-than-expected bids and Colombian
and foreign inflation.
2.11      In connection with the above loans, ISA agreed to review its bylaws
with the assistance of consultants. The review was carried out by Motor
Columbus of Switzerland and completed in 1974, two years later than the agreed
schedule. After delays resulting from the negotiations referred to in 1.11,
the most important of Motor Columbus' recommendations are reflected in ISA's
bylaws or in the proposed loan documents. The experience gained in the
implementation of these projects has influenced the technical, financial and
institutional arrangements for the proposed San Carlos I Project:
(a) To reduce the risk of unexpected geological problems (such as
those encountered with Chivor I) the appraisal mission included
a consulting geologist (4.28);
(b) To prevent a recurrence of the financial problems of
ISA's shareholders during implementation of the first two
projects and the resultant difficulties in meeting their
commitments to ISA in a timely manner, financial targets were
agreed with four of the five major shareholders and programs
of rate increases have been initiated which should ensure
availability of adequate funds to ISA (6.19-29); and
(c) Finally, agreement was secured on various amendments to
ISA's bylaws to establish a clear basis for the utility's
future operations and its relations with its shareholders.
ISA's Shareholders
2.12      ISA's shareholders fall into two categories:
(a)  The two major municipal utilities, EEEB and EPM, which own
50% of ISA shares; and



- 16 -
(b) The t:hree National Government utilities, CVC, ICEL and
CORELCA, which, together with their subsidiaries, own
the balance.
2.13      The municipal utilities have been generally successful and
relatively well-managed. Both serve concentrated urban markets in Colombia's
two largest urban areas and have access to low-cost source of power.  In
1974-75, EPM encountered some difficulties as a result of political inter-
ference in management and both utilities' finances were adversely affected by
low power rates. These problems are now being corrected and EEEB and EPM's
performance is expected to improve. The other three major shareholders of ISA
have in the past been less successful than EEEB and EPM as a result of the
nature of the mlarkets they serve and the complexity of their organization,
briefly summarized below. Annex 2.2 contains additional details on the five
major shareholders and Chapter 6 reviews their financial outlook.
2.14      CVC is an autonomous corporation which, together with other regional
development corporations, reports to NPD. It is responsible for multipurpose
development of the Cauca Valley. It is active in the fields of power, coal
mining, irrigation, rural development and hotel operation. The largest city
in the Cauca VaLlley, Cali, is served by a municipally-owned utility, EMCALI.
Most of the othier important communities in the area are served by CVC directly
or through 26 subsidiaries. CVC owns 65% of the shares of CHIDRAL, the
principal bulk power supplier in the area; the balance of the shares are owned
by EMCALI and the Municipality of Cali. CVC and EMCALI have agreed to set up
a new regional power company to take charge of power generation and transmission
in the Cauca Valley. They have expressed their intention of consulting their
creditors (among which the Bank is included as a result of its early power
loans to CVC and CHIDRAL - Annex 1.1 - and its more recent loans to EMCALI for
wa,ter supply: 682-CO and 1523-CO in 1970 and 1978, respectively) on this
proposal.
2.15      ICEL is a government institute reporting to the Ministry of Mines
and Energy. Through 11 subsidiaries, ICEL is responsible for power development
in most of the country, with the exception of the areas covered by CVC,
CORELCA and the various municipal utilities. ICEL's subsidiaries will be major
users of the output of the San Carlos I project. To enhance their efficiency,
ICEL agreed to take all necessary action to strengthen the management, planning,
operations and finances of its subsidiaries. To formulate an improvement program,
ICEL's central staff would conduct a study of at least five of its subsidiaries.
ICEL would present the study to the Bank, together with its proposals for
imtplementation, by December 31, 1979. Implementation of the proposals, with any
modifications resulting from the comments of the Bank, would be completed by
December 31, 1981.
2.16      CORELCA is a government-owned corporation reporting to the Ministry
of Mines and Energy. It is responsible for generation, bulk supply and the
coordination of power development in Colombia's Atlantic Coast region. The
newest of ISA's shareholders, it has been functioning since 1972 and in 1975
took over ICEL's controlling interest in the 7 local utilities serving the
area. In order to increase its effectiveness in handling its rapidly growing



- 17 -
operations, CORELCA agreed to strengthen its management and finances. To
this end, it would carry out a study with the assistance of consultants acting
under terms of reference to be furnished to the Bank for comment by September
30, 1978. The study's conclusions would be presented to the Bank for comment
by June 30, 1979, together with CORELCA's proposals for implementation. By
December 31, 1980, CORELCA would carry out an improvement program based on its
proposals and the Bank's comments thereon.

3. THE POWER MARKET
HisLoric
3.01      In 1976 total electricity requirements in the country were about
14.6 TWh (1.18). Of this, the Central Market system (serving the Pacific
Coast and the interior), with the main utilities EEEB, EPM, EMCALI and various
subsidiaries of CVC and ICEL accounted for about 76% (11.1 TWh), the Atlantic
Coast system (CORELCA and subsidiaries) about 14% (2 TWh) and numerous isolated
public utilities about 3% (0.5 TWh). The remainder (7% or about 1 TWh) was
generated by industrial plant for its own purposes.
3.02      The overall 1972-77 power data for ISA's shareholders (Annex 3.1)
is summarized as follows:
Average
1972          1974      1976             Growth
Generation (Gross) (GWh)  8,868           10,719   13,087              10.2
Maximum demand (MW)        1,740           2,010    2,460               9.0
Sales (total) (GWh)        7,405 (100%)   8,862   10,542 (100%)         9.2
Residential              3,018 ( .41%)   3,650    4,384 ( 42%)       9.8
Industrial               2,612 ( 35%)   3,056    3,656 ( 35%)        8.8
Commercial                 940 ( 13%)   1,176    1,385 ( 13%)       10.2
Others                     835 ( 11%)      980    1,117 ( 11%)        7.5
Losses (%)                  16.5            17.3      19.4             14.8 /1
/1   For losses expressed in GWh.
In 1967-1976 the country's growth rate of electricity production was about
10.5% compared with a growth rate of GNP of 6%/a. Growth of sales, which
averaged 9.2%/a, varied from a low 6.1%/a for the CVC-CHIDRAL system to a high
of 11.7% for ICEL's system. The pattern of supply and demand has not changed
materially: the share of each system in the market hardly varied and the
distribution among the various consumer categories was the same in 1972 and
1976. The rather large difference in the 5-year growth pattern of generation
compared with maximum demand and sales appears to be due to the combination
of the rationing in 1976 (suppressing maximum demand) and the increases in
losses. Losses increased considerably in the three largest systems (probably
due to the rapid expansion of urban networks and an increase in theft). For
the CORELCA system, where generation is practically all thermal, losses are
comparatively low (taking into account that these losses include plant use).
In view of the importance of reducing losses to a minimum, ISA agreed to carry
out, with the assistance of consultants satisfactory to the Bank, a study of
the nature, size and occurrence of losses in its own system and those of its
shareholders. The study is expected to make recommendations for reduction of
losses and (if required) improved metering systems. The report would be



- 19 -
completed and submitted to the Bank for review and discussion not later than
June 30, 1979. This study would be financed by the proposed San Carlos I loan
(4.14) and ISA's shareholders agreed to assist in its execution.
3.03      During late 1976 and early 1977 supply was seriously rationed (about
5-10% of requirements could not be met during the 5-month dry season depending
on the supply area) in the Central Interconnected System, principally in the
areas served by CVC and CHEC. The 1976/77 rainy season was unusually dry,
and commissioning of Chivor I hydro and the thermal plant at Barranca were
delayed. Supply was also rationed in the Atlantic system due to the gas
shortage resulting from delayed completion of a gas pipeline to Barranquilla.
Forecasts
3.04      Projected demand and energy requirements are based on ISA's detailed
analysis of past consumption trends in the market served by each of ISA's
shareholders and on a study of the correlation between power sector growth
and growth of GNP at rates of 6%, 6.5% and 7%. During appraisal some adjust-
ments have been made in the industrial forecast in order to reflect possible
construction delays for new factories and their ability to reach full produc-
tion. From 1981 onward the Central and Atlantic systems are considered as
integrated in view of the completion of the 500-kV Interconnection Project
(Chapter 5).
3.05      The 1977-85 electricity requirements in the interconnected system
are expected to grow at an average of 10.6%/a, approximately in accordance
with historic trends. As a result, gross energy requirements of the utilities
would be the following:
Coincident
Year     EEEB       EPM       CVC      ICEL      CORELCA   Total /1  Maximum Demand
---------------------------(GWh)-------------------------------             (MW)
1977    4,079      3,514    2,126    2,971        2,076      14,766        2,843
1980    5,600      5,072    2,690    4,590        2,814      20,766       3,898
1983    7,689      6,314    3,402    6,022        4,224      27,651       5,123
1985    9,273      7,337    3,979    7,164        5,030      32,783       6,068
/1   The differences between these totals and the total generation shown in
Annex 3.2 represent the losses in ISA's system.
This forecast appears reasonable.
Balances of Capacities and Energies
3.06      In accordance with information obtained during appraisal, in order
to meet the forecast power requirements in the national interconnected system
by 1984, about 4,200 MW in effective generating capacity would have to be
added to the 3,250 NW (2,970 MW effective) installed at the end of 1976. The
1976-85 balances for energies and capacities are shown in Annex 3.2 for
average water availability. Summarized they show the following:

Due to delays in hydro plant construction the capacity margin in the central
system is expected to decrease to 16% until interconnection. This is low,
because in dry years the effective capacity of the hydro stations could be
reduced by some 20-25% due to the lower water head above the turbines.
Even after interconnection, the overall capacity margin is not expected to
improve (although reserves would be shared) before 1984. The average for
1981-85 would be 15%, which appears to be lower than the minimum required
in view of the large hydro share.
3.07      Because the proposed San Carlos I and Mesitas projects, originally
scheduled for 1980, are not expected to be commissioned before 1982, and
because certain reservoirs may not have reached the normal water-level,
energy rationing may be required during 1982 to 1985 if hydrology conditions
are below average. The energy shortfalls in any of the years (1 in 5 years
probability) could be as follows:
Dry Year                Shortage
(GWh/%)
1982                   797/3.1
1983                   672/2.4
1984                   705/2.3
1985                 1,662/5.0
To avoid this situation ISA has recently introduced some changes in its program
(4.02).
3.08      With the commissioning of Chivor I (Loan 681-CO) in September 1977,
ISA for the first time generated energy in the interconnected system. Its
generation is expected to rise rapidly from 1.2 TWh in 1977 to some 11 TWh in
1985 when it would meet about 35% of total requirements:

ISA's sales to its shareholders for 1977-85 are shown in Annex 3.3; the energy
to be transferred from the Central system to the Atlantic system (by means of
the 500-kV Interconnection Line, see Chapter 5) would be in the order of 1.1-1.3
TWh by 1984/85, representing an average capacity of 125-150 MW.
Operation of the Interconnected System - Load Dispatching
3.09      ISA's bylaws give it the function of coordinating the operation of
the systems of its shareholders in order to use the available resources
economically. Its activity in this area has been limited due to lack of
adequate control facilities; a national dispatch center in Bogota and
2 regional dispatch centers (Medellin, Manizales) are scheduled for completion
by 1981 under a project expanding Chivor II project, financed by IDB. It is
expected that by that time agreements will be reached on the responsibilities
to be assigned to ISA and the entities operating in the interconnected system,
with a view to efficient operation of all facilities, optimum reliability of
the system and the creation of an intersystem power sale and purchase pool
(Annex 3.4).

THE SAN CARLOS I HYDRO POWER PROJECT
The Program
4.01      The 620-MW first stage of the hydro plant at San Carlos (and the
500-kV Interconnection--see Chapter 5--of the Central and Atlantic Coast
systems) forms part of the 1977-84 national expansion program. At the time of
appraisal the program comprised the following:

- 23 -
4.02      The plants assigned to specific shareholders have been approved
by ISA's Board, as has the 180 MW power component of CVC's Salvajina multi-
purpose project 1/. Construction of Mesitas is underway, and ISA has intro-
duced some revisions to avoid shortages in the event of a dry year during
1982-85. These include diversion of additional water into the Chivor reservoir
to increase its average generation from 3.7 TWh to 4.5 TWh and addition of 200
MW of steam plant in 1980-81.
The Project
4.03      The San Carlos hydro plant will be located in northwest Colombia
at an elevation of 775 m above sea level. The inlet to the plant would be
at the confluence of the San Carlos and Guatape rivers, downstream of the
outlet of EPM's existing Guatape hydro plant (Annex 4.1). The output of both
Guatape and San Carlos would be regulated by the large Santa Rita reservoir
(which is being expanded under Loan 874-CO to EPM). As reported in Annex 2.2
filling of this reservoir has been delayed, and action is being taken to
ensure that it commences in mid-1978.
4.04      Objectives.  The San Carlos Project will considerably increase
ISA's capacity in generating plant and, together with the 500-kV Inter-
connection system (Chapter 5), enhance ISA's role'as the agency, operating
throughout the country on behalf of the main utilities, to harness the
larger hydro potentials for meeting future power requirements. One of the
principal objectives would be to strengthen ISA's role as coordinator of
sector development and as dispatch agency in the interconnected system.
ISA, through the Project, would meet incremental power requirements in the
Central system and would additionally supply firm and secondary energy to the
CORELCA system in order to replace part of its expensive thermal generation.
4.05      Construction and Location.  The San Carlos plant will be built in
two stages. San Carlos I (4.07) comprises the Punchina dam on the Guatape
River, inlet and discharge tunnels and an underground power station suitable
for ten 155 MW generating units (and their transformers) of which four will
be installed initially (620 MW). San Carlos II comprises construction of
a second inlet and discharge tunnel, some civil engineering works (main
excavation will be completed during Stage I) for the power station and the
installation of six 155 MW generating units, increasing the total installed
capacity to 1,550 MW.
4.06      The project area is at a distance of 150 km from the city of
Medellin by a road of which 60 km are paved; the remaining 90 km correspond
to a serviceable all-weather road. The Project design takes into account
the weight limit (60 tons) and volume limit imposed by the existing roads.
1/   Not included in the program examined in Chapter 7 because its generation
will be subordinated to irrigation requirements and the construction
schedule has not yet been defined.

In 1979, ISA will begin constructing the San Lorenzo dam and the Jagual power
station (120 M!W) on the Nare river, to harness additional waters (39 m Is on
average) whiclh will be discharged into the Guatape river upstream of the
San Carlos plant, thereby providing for additional generation at San Carlos.
4.07      Description.  The San Carlos I Project will use an average discharge
of 98 m /s supplied by the Guatape River and the flow diverted from the
Nare River via the Guatape power station and regulated by the Santa Rita
reservoir, with a useful capacity of 1,200 million , for generating an average
of 3.7 TWh/a. The Project comprises:
3
(a)  An iearth dam 70 m high with a volume of 6 Mm , 1/ a cut and
cover double diversion conduit later serving as bottom outlet
on the right abutment, 413 m long, and a concrete lined chute

diameters ranging from 5.50 m to 3.30 m;
(d) Two caverns, one for turbine-generators and one for trans2
formers, Iach 203 m long and with cross-sections of 510 m
and 190 m respectively, interconnected by a number of
galleries. Both caverns will be excavated completely to
accommodate final development of the power station, but
concrete structures would only be built for the powerhouse
and for the first four generating units at this stage;
(e)  A two-lane, concrete-paved access tunnel 2to the powerhouse.
802 m long, with a cross-section of 39 m ;
(f)  A dLschirge tunnel, 1,471 m long, with a horseshoe cross-section
of 74 m , which will not be lined except at the terminals and
in fault zones;
3                3
I/   The reservoir will have a total storage of 72 Mm , of which 50 Mm   are
useful storage for power generation. The dam will serve both the first
and second phase of construction.

transmission line between San Carlos and Torca (near Bogota) and
related terminal substations;
(1) A study of losses in the systems of ISA and its shareholders (3.02).
4.08      Estimated Cost.  The Project is estimated to cost MUS$367, with a
foreign component of MUS$204. The costs, which are detailed in Annex 4.2, are

4.09      A first cost estimate was made by ISA's consultant (Integral-
Colombia) in 1972. In 1973, the US firm of Jacobs Associates (financed
by loan 575-CO) reviewed both the construction program and the estimate.
Integral later introduced a number of changes in the project as surveys
and final design advanced (4.13), and prepared the final estimates.
4.10      The cost estimate of the civil works is based on the cost of similar
work being carried out in Colombia (Chivor II, Guatape II); the bids received
by ISA for the major civil works correspond closely to the total estimated



- 26 -
base cost for these works (4.08). The equipment estimates are based on the
prices quoted at the end of 1976, in response to an international call for
bids on similar equipment for the Chivor II power station.  The physical
conwingencies have bee'n estimated to average 15% for the power station, 10%
for the remaining civil works and 8% for equipment. These percentages are
considered appropriate, having regard to the status of detailed design. The
base estimated cost is in prices calculated for the end 1976, to which a price
contingency has been added; the following percentages have been used for
external inflation:

Internal inflation was assumed to decrease gradually from 36% in 1977 to 8% by
1982, remaining constant thereafter. The exchange rate (Col$ 36.50 per US$ in
1977) has assumed to increase to Col$ 58.58 per US$ by 1984. Construction
equipment accounts for about 56% of the foreign cost component of the civil
works.
4.11      Financing.  Including financial charges on loans and credits, the
total foreign exchange requirements are estimated at MUS$258. A Bank loan of
MUS$126 is proposed, representing 49% of these requirements, which would
finance part (MUS$99.2) of the foreign cost of the Project and the financial
charges on the Bank loan during construction, as follows:

(MUS$70) which would finance the Punchina Dam, some equipment including the
penstock and financing charges on the IDB loan; supplier's credits (MUS$40)
and ISA's shareholders (MUS$22, mainly for the access tunnels, financing



- 27 -
charges, down payments and price adjustments). The local costs would be
financed by equity contributions and bonds to be subscribed by ISA's
shareholders (6.10).
Engineering ard Construction Schedule, Studies
4.13      With the assistance of Integral, ISA completed a study of the
hydroelectric potential of the Nare-Guatape-Samana river complex in 1971.
This study identified the projects of San Carlos, Jaguas apd Las Playas.
Subsequently (1972) ISA engaged Integral for final design of San Carlos and
with the Bank's agreement, ISA has retained the services of these consultants
for all phases of the project. Integral will engage outside expertise for
specialized tasks during construction, as needed.
4.14      IDB will finance the services of a group of international experts to
advise ISA on specific technical aspects and problems during construction.
The estimated cost of these services (excluding price contingency) is MUS$0.5.
The proposed Bank loan will finance the remaining foreign cost (MUS$1.2 base
cost) of (a) the purchase of laboratory equipment (MUS$0.25) and vehicles
(MUS$0.40); (b) factory inspection (MUS$0.25) and testing of equipment
(MUS$0.10); and (c) study of losses (3.02; MUS$0.25). Contingencies on these
items amount to MUS$0.5. About 70 man-months of consulting services is
required at an average base cost of US$7,000/man-month.
4.15      The access tunnel is being constructed, for completion in 1978, by
the Brazilian firm Mendes Junior. The contract amounts to MUS$4.6 equivalent
and ISA is financing the works with its own funds.
4.16      The main underground works, which are expected to be started during
the second quarter of 1978, would be concluded by mid-1982. The critical path
of construction is the excavation of the caverns for the generating units and
transformers. The Project implementation schedule of which key dates are
shown in Annex 4.3 would be used to monitor progress during the project
construction period; this schedule also covers the transmission lines to
connect San Carlos to the system and the study of losses (3.02).
Procurement
4.17      Procurement of goods and services to be financed by the proposed
Bank loan (other than those of consultants) would be in accordance with
international competitive bidding consistent with the Bank's Guidelines
for Procurement. Colombian manufacturers would receive a preference of
15% or applicable duties, whichever is the lesser, for purposes of bid
evaluation. The cost estimate assumes that local manufacturers would supply
conductors, towers and certain miscellaneous electromechanical equipment, with
an estimated cost of about MUS$10, the ex-factory cost (net of taxes) of which
would be financed by the proposed loan. In view of legal freight preferences
for Colombian ships, satisfactory evidence is to be provided to the Bank for
the purpose of financing, that freight cost are in accordance with
international levels.



- 28 -
4.18      A total of 14 firms were perqualified for the major civil work
contract in accordance with procedures acceptable to the Bank and ISA called
bids in June 1977. Bids were opened in November 1977 to permit award of
s_ntract in early kpril 1978 because major construction activity is limited to
the dry season (November/December to April/May of the following year (see also
4.24)). This would provide the contractor 6 months for mobilizing all required
construction equipment, construction of the workers' village and clearing of
sites during the wet season of 1978.  Any delay beyond April 1978 for award of
contract would cause a delay in Project completion (and give rise to severe
rationing of electricity in Colombia during the period of delay). The Bank
therefore concurred with ISA's proposal to award the contract to the lowest
evaluated bidder, a consortium comprising Ingenieros Civiles Asociades (ICA)
of Mexico and GRANDICON of Colombia. Retroactive financing is proposed for
the downpayment of this contract, expected to be signed in the near future
l(MUS$ 4.0) and for consulting services for the preparation of the Project
subsequent to January 1, 1977, estimated to amount to MUS$ 0.2.
4.19      Bid documents for the remaining components to be financed by the
proposed loan are being prepared by Integral in accordance with the implemen-
tation schedu:Le for Bank review. The recommendations for award of the various
contracts wou:Ld be prepared by ISA with the assistance of Integral.
Disbursements
4.20      Funds from the proposed loan would finance 100% of (a) the foreign
expenditures iEor underground civil works; (b) the foreign expenditures for
imported equipment and materials; (c) the foreign expenditures for erection of
works; (d) the foreign expenditures for consultants' services or 50% of total;
and (e) 94% ofE the ex-factory cost of locally produced materials and equipment;
and (f) interest and other charges on the Bank loan accrued up to March 14, 1983.
Annex 4.4 shows the estimated loan disbursements, assuming loan effectiveness
in September 1978. The first unit is expected to be operational in September
1982 and the Project is expected to be completed by June 30, 1983. The
closing date would be June 30, 1984 to allow for the payment of retention
moneys.
Environmental Aspects 1/
4.21      The project area is characterized by extremely hilly topography,
lpoor soils and high rainfall, making the entire area unsuitable for farming or
stockraising. A small village in the reservoir area with about 70 families
will be displaced by the Project.  An adequate program for acquiring all
properties in the area and the evacuation of people has been communicated to
the Bank. Evacuation would be completed by June 1979 and implementation of
the first part of the agreed program would be a condition of effectiveness, in
order to assure that construction is not affected by delays. The construction
of San Carlos I and the other power plants (San Carlos II, Jaguas and Playas)
to be built in the area would create new sources of income for the local

- 29 -
population during the respective construction periods. Thereafter, employment
opportunities would arise in connection with the control of the land use in
the area (4.22).
4.22      ISA will have to take adequate measures to control development of
water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) in the reservoir area; conditions
there are favorable to its development, and it has already caused problems
in Colombia in hydroelectric and irrigation projects. Before December 31,
1980, ISA would, in consultation with the Bank, formulate a satisfactory
medium-range program for rational use of the Project basins, including
reforestation. ISA also agreed to organize a unit with adequate funding,
staffing and facilities to carry out the program not later than December 31,
1981.
Project Risks
4.23      The Project is subject to the risks normally associated with large
civil works in difficult terrain as summarized in the following paragraphs.
4.24      Climatic Conditions.  Climatic conditions will not greatly affect
the underground works except that landslides on the access roads could
temporarily hold up the work. Heavy rains may affect dam construction,
although this should be mitigated by careful selection of materials and maxi-
mum utilization of construction equipment during the dry season. Another
factor that could affect the Project is the flooding of the Guatape and
Samana rivers. In view of this, the cofferdams have been designed to be
built in two stages. The first stage (to be started at the beginning of
the 1978 dry season) will protect the works against a dry-season flood
occuring once in 25 years and the second stage (to be completed before
the end of the 1978 dry season) against a 25-year wet-season flood. The
water level in the Samana River can rise by more than 12 meters within a
few hours, but the discharge tunnel outlet has been located above the
maximum recorded cresting elevation, in order to avoid interruption of
operations during floods.
4.25      Geology.  The Punchina dam, the intakes and the greater part
of the pressure tunnels (80-85%) are located on and in sound igneous
rocks, not requiring any kind of support. The remaining part of the
pressure tunnels, the power house and the discharge tunnels are located in
metamorphic rock requiring rock bolts or shotcrete and possibly some steel
rib supports. A small portion (5-8%) of tunnelling would be done across
fault zones, where metal supports will be used in combination with shotcrete.
4.26      Before the first stage of San Carlos is completed, the adduction
tunnel for the second phase will be under construction. The consultant
therefore recommended concrete lining throughout, to avoid water leaks to
the works under construction through faults and to better protect the San
Carlos I works against the effects of blasting of the San Carlos II tunnel.
This measure has been shown to be advisable by recent experience with Chivor I
and II which have similar parallel tunnels.



- 30 -
4.27      Although excavation of the caverns is not expected to present any
major problems, unforeseen situations may arise having regard to the volume
of the excavation work and the width of the galleries. To minimize this
ri k, once the acce--  tnnel now under construction is completed, two
exploratory tunnels will be built for the length of the caverns in order to
ascertain the rock conditions at the powerhouse site more precisely and to
define the final orientation of the caverns. The bidding documents allow for
this contingency and indicate the maximum permissible limits for locations of
the powerhouse.
4.28      In order to review the Project's geological aspects, the Bank
engaged Dr. A. Merritt, a U.S. engineering geologist, to participate in the
appraisal. Dr. Merritt agreed with the design recommendations of INTEGRAL
and additionally recommended that the method of supporting the cavern roofs
and walls should be restudied as and when more information on geologic condi-
tions becomes available once the access tunnel and the exploratory tunnels are
completed.
4.29      Seismicity.  There are a number of faults in the zone located within
a radius of 15-20 km around the project area. Two of them (the Mulato and
Jetudo faults) are classified as probably active (though there is little
evidence). The others are regarded as inactive. However, the works have been
designed for a seismic acceleration of 0.4 g (3.9 m/s2) with its epicenter in
one of the faults and with a spectrum similar to that recorded at Lima, Peru,
during the earthquake of October 1966. The dam is provided with an impervious
core and a clhimney-type filter of adequate thickness to be self-sealing in the
event of rupture due to an earthquake. The dam will be adequately instrumented
to continuously monitor its soundness. ISA agreed to engage qualified experts
for annual inspections of its dams and related facilities in accordance with
sound engineiering practices.

5. THE 500-kV INTERCONNECTION PROJECT
Objectives
5.01      The 500-kV Power Interconnection Project will interconnect the
country's two largest electricity systems: the Central System, which is
predominantly hydro, and the Atlantic Coast (CORELCA) System, which is
totally thermal. The Project will result in more economical development
and operation of the national power system, by substituting some hydro
for thermal generation and obtaining substantial savings on equipment through
reduced capacity reserve requirements.  ISA would construct all facilities on
behalf of the Government in accordance with an agreement on Project financing
and execution satisfactory to the Bank to be signed between the Government
and ISA before effectiveness of the proposed loan. The Government agreed
that, by December 31, 1981 ISA will operate and own the 500-kV Interconnection.
Description
5.02      The Interconnection Project comprises:
(a) a single-circuit 500-kV transmission line, 523 km long,
between San Carlos in the central region and the Sabanalarga
substation in the Atlantic (Northern) region;
(b) two 500/230/34.5-kV terminal substations, each with an initial
capacity of 450 MVA, one at San Carlos and the other at
Sabanalarga;
(c) two intermediate 500/115/34.5-kV substations, each with an
individual capacity of 150 MVA, one at Cerromatoso and one
at Chinu;
(d) A shunt compensation system with a capacity of 600 MVAr.
Transmission Line
5.03      The southern section of the transmission line between San Carlos
and Cerromatoso, which is 210 km long, crosses a mountainous region at
elevations of up to 2,000 m over its first 130 km. On this section lattice
towers will be used carrying four bundl2d conductors per phase of 740.8 MCM
aluminum alloy, shielded by two 46.5 mm Alumoweld wires. Over the
313-km northern section between Cerromatoso and Sabanalarga the terrain is
slightly rolling as far as the Chinu substation (km 342 from San Carlos).
The line then continues over similar terrain to a marshy area (at Dique
Canal) which it crosses for a distance of 15 km until about 43 km from the
terminal point. The last part of the line is on solid and flat terrain.
Over most of the northern section the line will be on guyed V-type towers
supporting sour bundled conductors per phase of 559.5-MCM aluminum alloy and
two 46.4-mm Alumoweld shield wires. The profile of the line, a single line
diagram and some details of construction are shown in Annex 5.1.



- 32 -
5.04      The diameter of the conductors was selected so as to limit the
radio interference level to obtain a signal-to-noise ratio of not leFs than
22 db for 90% of the time at a distance of 80 m from the axis of the line.
The arrangement of quad bundles was adopted because it offers a lower imped-
ance and lower conductor, structure and foundation cost for a given radio
interference level, low Corona losses and minimal wind vibration. The
insulator strings will be V-strung, consisting of 24-29 units per string,
depending on the elevation and the level of saline pollution (which occurs on
the northern section in the vicinity of the Sabanalarga substation and in some
intermediate areas). The total weight of the structures will be approximately
9,700 t. Where the line crosses marshy areas, prefabricated piles will be
used; for most of the rest of the line conventional foundations will be
used.
Substations
5.05      Terminal Substations.  The initial layout of the 500/230/34.5/kV-
San Carlos and Sabanalarga substations will be a ring arrangement using a
double-circuit-breaker scheme. Owing to the transport limitations, the
San Carlos substation will have a transformer bank consisting of six 75-MVA
single-phase units connected in groups of two parallel units per phase,
with a 75-MVA reserve unit. At Sabanalarga the transformer bank consists
of three autotransformers of 150 MVA and one reserve unit. The transformer
capacity can be doubled in a later stage in both substations for full utiliza-
tion of the transmission capacity of the line (900 MVA).
5.06      Intermediate Substations.  A three phase autotransformer of 150 MVA
(500/115/34.5 kV) will be installed in the Cerromatoso and Chinu substations
with a breaker-and-a-half scheme for the outgoing lines.
5.07      Shunt Compensation.  In order to compensate for reactive power at
low-load conditions, to provide better control of the voltage under the various
operating conditions, to facilitate single pole reclosings, and to reduce
voltage surges at service frequency caused by line switching or by single-
phase faults, the system will have 100% compensation (600 MVAr), of which 60%
will be connected solidly to the 500-kV line at the beginning and end of each
of the three line sections, while the remaining 40% will be connected to the
transformer's tertiary winding (34.5 kV) at the Cerromatoso and Chinu sub-
stations. Full inductive compensation and reclosing are of great importance
in the first stage until a second transmission line is installed, because at
500 kV most faults are expected to be transient ground faults.
Voltage Selection
5.08      The Colombian firm of Salgado, Melendez y Asociados (SAMEL), ISA's
consultants for the 500-kV Interconnection Project, carried out the studies
to determine the service voltage for the future national interconnection
network. The voltage of 500 kV was selected as the most economic over
alternatives of 400 kV and 700 kV, taking into wccount the transmission
distances and the transmission capacities required over a period of 20
years. In its comprehensive system design study, SAMEL was assisted by
Kennedy and Donkin (UK) which jointly with Westinghouse (USA) carried out
detailed transient-switching studies.

Project Cost
5.09      The construction cost of the 500-kV Interconnection Project. esti-
mated at MUS$167 with a foreign component of MUS$100, as shown in Annex 5.2
is summarized as follows:
Local   Foreign    Total    Local    Foreign  Total
-------- MCol$ ------          -------  MUS$ --------
Transmission line           851    1,342      2,193      23.3     36.8      60.1
Substations                279    1,372       1,651       7.6     37.6      45.2
Engineering                 222      121        343       6.1      3.3       9.4
Subtotal            1,352    2,835      4,187      37.0      77.7    114.7
Contingencies Physical       74      146        220       2.1      4.0       6.1
Price               1,305    1,087      2,392      28.1      18.3     46.4
2,731    4,068      6,799      67.2    100.0    167.2
5.10      The cost estimates for the equipment and the civil works were based
on current world and local prices for works of this kind. SAMEL has carried
out a detailed study of all elements, equipment, manpower utilization and
work quantities that will be required in the execution of the works; the
physical contingencies include 20% for right of way, 8% for the civil works
and 5% for the equipment, which are considered appropriate. The price
contingency factors used, are the same as for the San Carlos project (4.10).
Financing
5.11      A Bank loan of MUS$50 is proposed to finance the total foreign
exchange cost of the transmission line (50% of the total foreign cost of
the transmission facilities):
MUS$
(a)  Engineering                               1.8
(b)  Materials                                40.3
(c)  Civil works and erection                  7.9
Total                                 50.0
5.12      Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW) of the Federal Republic of
Germany would finance part of the foreign exchange components of the sub-
stations, for a total of DM 80 million, equivalent to about MUS$40. The
remaining foreign cost would be covered by suppliers' credits (MUS$10); the
Government would finance interest and finance charges on any loan or credit.
The local components of the Project (MUS$67 equivalent) would be financed by
the Government.



- 34 -
5.13       Bank financing for expenditures incurred by ISA for foreign engineer-
ing services for the Project during 1977 and early 1978 has been requested.
Retroactive f inancing up to an amount of US$200,000 from January 1, 1977
onword is proposed to -r^er these services.
Engineering aLnd Construction Program
5.14       ISA and CORELCA engaged the services of SAMEL and Commonwealth
(USA) in 1972 to study the feasibility of the Interconnection Project. The
study, which was completed in early 1975, shows the economic benefits of
interconnecting the Central and the Atlantic systems in view of the fuel
savings that would result from substituting thermal energy to be generated in
the northern system by hydro energy from the central system. Subsequently,
because the Board of ISA did not authorize the funds for execution of the
field work (surveys and selection of line route), ICEL assumed responsibility
for this work. A steering committee composed of ISA, ICEL and CORELCA repres-
entatives presented the feasibility study to the Government which approved the
Project.
5.15       SAMEL, with the assistance of Kennedy and Donkin (UK), also prepared
the bidding documents, with financing by Fondo Nacional de Proyectos de
Desarrollo (FONADE) from the proceeds of Loan 971-CO. ISA has also engaged
SAMEL, assisted by Kennedy and Donkin, for continuation of their services for
the detailed design of the line and substations and for supervision of the
works. Colombian law requires engagement of independent consultants to ensure
that work is executed in accordance with the contracts. ISA is currently
negotiating writh Integral for this service. Because multiple expertise
appears justified for the Project (the first 500-kV facilities in Colombia),
these servicets would also be eligible for financing by the loan. The
engagement of these consultants under conditions satisfactory to the Bank
should be a condition of effectiveness of the proposed loan.
5.16       The! foreign base cost of the consulting services to be financed by
the proposed loan amounts to MUS$1.5, with the following breakdown: engineer-
ing, MUS$0.3; supervision during construction, MUS$0.9; and inspection and
testing of equipment, MUS$0.3. About 200 man-months of consulting services
are required at an estimated cost of US$7,200 per man-month. The foreign cost
of engineering services (also by SAMEL) for the substations (US$1.5 million)
is included in the proposed KfW loan.
5.17       The! construction of the 500-kV line would start in the third quarter
of 1978 and works would be completed by April 1981. The construction of the
four substations would start in early 1979 and would also be completed in
April 1981. The critical path of construction is the supply of power trans-
formers, reactors and circuit-breakers. The project implementation schedule
Annex 5.3, based on the critical path program, would be used to monitor
progress during the construction period.



- 35 -
5.18      ISA has not previously encountered major problems in acquiring
right-of-way for construction of its transmission lines. It has submitted
a satisfactory program to the Bank for obtaining right-of-way and permits to
ensure that the contractor can enter the various work sites at the appropriate
time. Acquisit ons would be completed by June 30, 1979 for the line. ISA has
already acquired the lands on which the substations would be built.
Procurement
5.19      Procurement for goods and services to be financed by the proposed
Bank loan (other than consulting services) would be through international
competitive bidding under Bank guidelines. Bids for the transmission line
were called in July 1977 and opened in November. The lowest evaluated bid was
received from a consortium comprising Sul Americana de Engenharia (SADE,
Colombia, Brasil), Sociedad Venezolana de Electrificacion (SVECA, Venezuela)
and Societa Anonima Electrificazione (SAE, Italy). Award is expected to be
made immediately following approval of the proposed loan.
5.20      The supply and erect contract would cover all works for each
of both sections of the line (materials and civil works). Though local
manufacturers did not bid (because they lack experience with equipment of the
kind included in the Project), any qualified Colombian bidder would receive a
preference margin of the lesser of 15% or applicable custom duties on minor
equipment that still has to be procured. With respect to freight, financing
of these costs would be subject to the conditions mentioned in 4.17. The bid
documents for the substation, transformers and reactors have been issued in
February 1978, after KfW review, and award is scheduled for October.
Disbursements
5.21      Funds from the proposed loan would finance (a) 100% of the foreign
expenditures for the imported materials and equipment; (b) 94% of the ex-factory
cost of locally produced materials and equipment; (c) 100% of the foreign expendi-
tures for civil works and erection; (d) 100% of the foreign expenditures or 50%
of total cost for consultants' services. Annex 5.4 shows estimated loan dis-
bursements, assuming loan effectiveness in September 1978. The closing date
would be June 30, 1982 to allow for the payment of retention moneys.
Environment
5.22      No environmental problems are anticipated. 1/  The transmission
line will cross a rural area that is partly mountainous, with few inhabitants,
little farming activity and sparse woodlands. People affected would be
compensated for any damage to property or crops and for the use of rights-
of-way. Radio and television interference would be minimal (5.04). Visual
impact will be reduced because the line will, for most of its length, be
carried on V-type pylons.

Project Risks
5.23      While this would be the first 500-kV transmission system to be
installed in Colombia, ISA has incorporated adequate safeguards in the design
against anticipated problems (5.07).  ISA agreed to prepare by the end
of 1978 a satisfactory program for training of the staff required to operate
the interconnection system and to implement it thereafter. Because the
Government considers the project to be of top priority, the implementation
schedule (Annex 5.3) appears realistic.

6. FINANCES
Introduction
6.01      ISA will continue to depend heavily on its shareholdezs to finance
its investments during the project construction period. In the past, ISA
has encountered major problems when its shareholders had financial diffi-
culties (as a consequence of their low rates). ISA's financial situation
during the project construction period, therefore, depends largely on the
application of adequate tariff policies by the shareholders, based on technical
and financial rather than political and regional considerations. The tariff
policies agreed with ISA, EEEB, EPM, CVC, and CORELCA together with Government
assurances on the provision of funds to CVC, ICEL and CORELCA, would provide a
sound financial basis for the projects.
ISA's Performance and Financial Position
6.02      ISA was created in 1967.  Over the following ten years it functioned
in accordance with its original bylaws, which were based on the concept of
sharing ISA's operating costs, debt service and local construction expenditures
among its shareholders according to agreed formulae. The revenue covenants
for IBRD Loans 575-CO and 681-CO were consistent with those provisions. 1/
ISA's main financial problems during this period resulted from slow payment
by its shareholders of amounts owed; secondary problems included ISA's failure
to include depreciation charges in the operating expenses recovered from its
shareholders and the tendency of some shareholders to invest in ISA's bonds
while allowing arrears to accumulate on accounts payable for transmission
charges, energy and equity contributions. To avoid a recurrence of these
problems, the Government, ISA and its shareholders agreed that:
(a) ISA would:
(i) recover from any shareholder the financial costs arising from
borrowings incurred by ISA to cover cash shortfalls caused
by delays in receiving payments from that shareholder; and
(ii) apply any payment made to it by its shareholders (except if
such payment were to be made pursuant to legislation which
precludes this procedure) in the following order of priority:

1/   Except that they required that ISA earn a 9% rate of return on generating
assets. Since ISA's first generating plant, Chivor I, did not commence
operations until mid-1977 (at which time the arrangements described in
6.13 were being discussed) this provision was never applied.

(b) the shareholders would:
(i) reimburse ISA by December 31, 1979 for amounts due on
account of depreciation for 1977 and earlier years; and
(ii) pay all other accounts within sixty days of billing; and
(c) the Government would:
(i) make available to the ISA shareholders it controls (CVC,
CORELCA and ICEL) any funds they may require to fulfill
their financial obligations to ISA; and
(ii) assist the other two ISA shareholders (EEEB and EPM) in
securing any loans they may require to comply with their
financial obligations to ISA.
6.03      The recent amendments of ISA's bylaws specify that ISA will earn
a reasonable rate of return on its revalued investment in the transmission
system (financed by IBRD Loan 575-CO) and on its generating plants and
associated transmission facilities. This is a major improvement over the
previous proc,edure, since it would allow ISA to generate funds internally
for future expansion (6.12).
6.04      ISA's long-term capitalization (see Attachment 6/2 to this chapter,
page 48) reflects the provisions of its bylaws which require that the foreign
cost of its projects and a high proportion (previously 60%, now increased to
up to 80%) of local costs be financed by debt. As of December 31, 1976, it
was as follows:
MCol$             %_
Equity                            1,533               19
Bonds (held by shareholders)      1,284               16
Other long-term debt              5,225               65
Total                         8,042             100
ISA's high debt/equity ratio is mitigated by the fact that the bylaws specify
very favorable terms for its bonds, which make them practically equivalent to
equity. After the recent amendments, the bylaws provide that bonds will mature
when ISA is wound up (the bylaws specify a 50-year life for ISA, which may be
extended) and that their yield will be equal to the dividend on ISA's shares.
The bylaws require each shareholder to make a contribution in the form of shares
and bonds to cover the portion of the local costs of each plant which cannot be
obtained from other sources. This contribution should be proportional to the
shareholder's agreed participation in the output of the plant.
6.05      ISA's equity is understated, since Colombian legislation only
allows, for ac:counting purposes, revaluation of assets to offset exchange-
rate adjustments on borrowings. ISA, EEEB, EPM, CORELCA and CVC/GHIDRAL have



- 39 -
revalued their assets fully, for purposes of performance measurement. They
agreed to continue revaluing their assets annually and to present an annual
report on the revaluation; the first report would be presented by June 30,
1978 (for 1977) and those for succeeding years by March 1 of each year.
6.06      ISA-s long-term debt on December 31, 1976 (Annex 6.1) comprised:
(a) Bank loans 575-CO and 681-CO (transmission project, Chivor I) totaling
MCol$2,603; (b) IDB loans 214-OC-CO and 263-OC-CO (Chivor I, Chivor II)
amounting to MCol$1,606; and (c) supplier's and other credits amounting to
MCol$1,015; and (d) bonds, held by ISA shareholders (MCol$1,284).
Financing Plan
6.07      ISA's 1977-1984 investment program includes:  (a) the proposed
Projects (San Carlos I and 500-kV Interconnection); (b) the completion of
Chivor II; and (c) future expansion in generating facilities (4.01) required
by the national interconnected system and the corresponding transmission
expansion. ISA's funds statements for the eight-year period are shown in
Attachment 6/3 to this chapter (page 49). The financing plan for the
disbursement period of the bulk of the proposed loans (1978-1982) is
summarized as follows:

6.08      During the period, ISA's net internal cash generation represents
9.5% of the investment program. This is low, but acceptable when viewed in
conjunction with the shareholders' contribution of 26.7% towards ISA's expan-
sion program. The latter represents an important consumers' contribution
of the main cities of Bogota, Medellin and Cali through EEEB, EPM and CVC.
The annual amounts contributed (in the form of equity and bonds) by each
shareholder are shown in Annex 6.2. Since ISA will not be in a position to
pay cash dividends to its shareholders and would have to borrow to service its
bonds, the shareholders agreed to reinvest any dividend (or debt service on
ISA bonds) during the construction period of the San Carlos I Project.
Financing of interest during construction on the proposed Bank loan for the
San Carlos I Project is recommended in view ot the heavy strain imposed on ISA
by its large construction program, the cost of which is far in excess of the
capacity of its existing assets to generate revenues.
6.09      In line with ISA's bylaws, the financing plan assumes that borrowings
would cover most of the foreign cost of San Carlos I (4.12). The terms assumed
are as follows:
(a) Proposed IBRD loan: interest 7.5%, maturity 17 years,
including four years of grace;
(b) IDB loan: interest 8.0%, maturity 20 years, including
5-1/2 years of grace; and
(c) Supplier's credits: interest 8.5%, maturity 10 years,
including two years of grace.
The effectiveness of the Bank loan for the Interconnection Project would be
conditional on receipt of evidence that ISA has complied with the conditions
precedent to the first disbursement of the IDB loan and has made satisfactory
arrangements for the balance of the foreign exchange requirements.
6.10      The shareholders would cover the portion of the foreign cost of
San Carlos I not covered by the above financing, as well as local costs which
exceed ISA's net internal cash generation, in the following proportions:
EEEB, 19%; EPM, 22%; CVC, 16%; ICEL, 30% and CORELCA, 13%. At least 60% of
these contributions would be in the form of equity.
6.11      The Government has agreed to finance the full cost of the 500-kV
Interconnection Project. It expects to cover substantially all foreign costs
with borrowed funds, including the proceeds of the proposed Bank and KfW loans
and of supplier' credits (5.12). Effectiveness of the proposed Bank loan would
be conditional on satisfactory arrangements having been made to finance the
project's foreign exchange costs.

Future Finances
6.12      ISA's forecast income statements 1978-84 (See Attachment 6/1 to
this chapter, page 47) are based on the assumption that starting in 1978 ISA
will operate on a sound commercial basis ensuring an adequate rate of return.
ISA's sales are based on a program simulating the operation of the inter-
connected system under average conditions of hydrology. The supply of secondary
hydroenergy, therefore, has not been taken into account which, under favorable
hydrological conditions can be of major importance in substituting thermal
generation, particularly in the CORELCA system, once the 500-kV Interconnection
Project has been completed. The forecasts are based on purchase of all of
ISA's output: by the shareholders as provided by a recently negotiated sales
agreement. The shareholders have agreed to perform their obligations under
this agreement, which specifies the amounts of capacity and energy to be
purchased in each hydro year by each shareholder, until the expected entry
into operation of Chivor II in 1980. At that time the agreement is expected
to be modified to cover forecast sales through the commissioning of San Carlos
I in 1983. The effectiveness of this sales agreement would be a condition of
effectiveness of the proposed San Carlos I loan.
6.13      ISA agreed to charge tariffs which would enable it to achieve a rate
of return on its revalued assets (excluding the 500-kV Interconnection) of not
less than 5.5% in 1978, 8% in 1979, 9% in 1980 and 11% in 1981. These targets
would result in ISA achieving an average 9% rate of return for 1978-81. The
9% rate of return target would be maintained for 1982 and subsequent years.
6.14      The charges for the 500-kV Interconnection would be set to achieve a
gradually increasing rate of return on revalued assets between the years
of initial operation (1982-84) and full loading of the line in 1987. Based
on transfer of 30% of the value of the facilities to ISA's plant in operation
in each of 1982-83 and the balance in 1984, the return would average at least
2.5% in this period. It would be not less than 4% in 1985, 6% in 1986 and 9%
in 1987 and subsequent years.
6.15      As can be seen from Attachment 6/3 (page 49), ISA faces extremely
heavy debt service obligations, which, despite its satisfactory forecast finan-
cial performance, are expected to increase at a faster rate than internal cash
generation. Unless ISA is able to secure financing of interest during con-
struction for projects subsequent to San Carlos I, the margin between gross
internal cash generation and debt service would be inadequate starting in 1980,
even after taking into account the fact that ISA's shareholders have agreed to
reinvest debt service on ISA's bonds during the construction period of San
Carlos I. ISA and its shareholders agreed to prepare and present to the Bank
no later than December 31, 1978 a review of ISA's finances covering the period
1979-85 which would include proposals for achieving an annual coverage of ISA's
debt service of at least 1.5 times in the period, thus providing an adequate
margin of safety for any borrowings which ISA might have to incur to meet con-
tingencies. The shareholders agreed to reinvest ISA dividends (or debt service
on ISA bonds) in any year in which ISA fails to meet the 1.5 test. In addition,



- 43 -
the shareholders would guarantee principal and interest on the proposed San
Carlos I loan in proportion to their shareholding. The shareholders also agreed
to provide any funds required by ISA to cover debt service.
6.16      In addition to the general restriction of future major generating
projects described in 1.25, ISA agreed to seek the Bank's concurrence,
until the Projects are completed, before undertaking any project costing in
excess of 2.5% of the value of its net fixed assets in operation. To ensure
sound financing of its future expansion, ISA agreed to seek the Bank's
concurrence before contracting any long term debt unless internal cash
generation is more than 1.5 times its maximum future debt service requirement
(excluding interest on bonds held by its shareholders and interest during
construction financed by loans).
Financial Outlook of ISA's Shareholders
6.17      To assure that the shareholders will be able to meet their obliga-
tions to ISA on account of capital contributions, bond subscriptions and
payments for the purchased energy, the financial situation of EEEB, EPM,
CVC and CORELCA over the project construction period has been reviewed
(Annexes 6.5-6.8). ICEL's obligations will continue to be covered with
Government contributions from the national budget. Because of the importance
of shareholders contributions to the project financing plan, the shareholders
agreed that they would not transfer any assets or take any other action which
would interfere with compliance with their obligations to ISA.
6.18      The financial projections of EEEB, EPM, CVC and CORELCA assume a
rate increase program, based on the requirements and possibilities of each
utility. The necessary rate increases for 1978 (based on presently forecast
inflation rates) have been approved by each shareholder. These increases
(and longer-term performance targets for 1979 onward) have been translated
into estimated rates of return based on revalued assets.
EEEB
6.19      Despite the decline in real terms of its rates through 1976 and
a relatively low rate of return on revalued assets (estimated to have averaged
6.6% in 1976-77) EEEB has been able to meet its obligations to ISA and to
make a reasonable contribution to its investment program. The utility has
operated under extremely favorable technical conditions, serving a highly
concentrated urban market with very low-cost generation and transmission
facilities. It has also benefited from prudent financial policies, relying
largely on long-term financing from the Bank, IDB and suppliers.
6.20      EEEB's low rates appear to have reduced its capacity to invest
adequately in distribution. Faced with the need to generate substantial
resources for distribution expansion and to carry out the Mesitas hydroelectric
project, EEEB has been implementing substantial rate increases. These increases
would amount to 46% in real terms over the period 1977-80, based on the current
forecasts of inflation. As a result, EEEB's rate of return on revalued assets
would improve to 7.8% in 1978 and 11.6% in 1979. Over the period covered by
the approved rate increase program (through 1980), EEEB's rate of return would
average 12%, and EEEB has agreed to achieve this target. The projections in



- 44 -
Annex 6.5 assume that rates would subsequently be kept constant in real terms.
EEEB's financial performance would be very satisfactory: debt service coverage
would be ample and a very substantial proportion of investment requirements
(including contributions to ISA) would be financed by net internal cash genera-
tion.
6.21      The main uncertainty underlying EEEB's financial projections relates
to the substantial borrowings it will have to undertake in support of its
investment program. The largest item in EEEB's construction program, Mesitas,
has been appraised with a view to a possible Bank loan. Bank financing is also
under consideration for EEEB's distribution investments. It is expected that
EEEB would be able to attract sizeable commercial and supplier financing,
partly as a consequence of the proposed Bank loans.
EPM
6.22      EPM's financial situation was very difficult in 1974 and 1975; it
improved in 1976 and 1977, as result of rate increases approved following
lengthy discussions with the Bank. EPM experienced cash shortages during
1974-75, which led to difficulties in timely payment to ISA and delays in
the Guatape II project. These financial problems were the direct consequence
of an inappropriate tariff policy adopted by EPM's previous Board. The new
Board (composed mainly of industrialists) and management are acting to reverse
this situation.
6.23      EPM's financial projections (Annex 6.6) are based on a monthly
increase of 2.2% starting in January 1978, which would produce a rate increase
in real terms of 4.7% in 1978. Application of the proposed rate increase
was initiated on schedule. If continued, it will improve EPM's financial
situation in 1978 and 1979. However, EPM's rate of return on revalued assets
will decline from 10% in 1977 to 7% in 1978 and fall further in 1979 as result
of (a) the addition of Guatape II to the rate base in 1978 (40% of the plant
cost) and 1979 (the remaining 60%), representing a 40% increase in total
assets; and (b) in these same years EPM will store water in the Santa Rita
reservoir in order to provide a back-up to the interconnected system in
1980/1981, when the reserves may be critically low. If instead, the Santa
Rita reservoir operation were based on EPM's own requirements (independently
of optimal interconnected system operations) the amounts of power purchased
from ISA would be considerably lower with consequent reduction in operating
costs. If the energy purchases were excluded from operating costs in 1979,
EPM would achieve a 9% rate of return in this year. Based on these considera-
tions EPM's rates of return in 1978 and 1979 are considered acceptable.
To achieve a rate of return of 6% in 1979 an additional rate increase of about
11% on average (in addition to the 2.2% monthly increase) would be necessary,
if the current inflation forecast proves correct. EPM agreed to apply the
rate increases needed to achieve at least the following rates of return on
revalued assets: 7% in 1978, 6% in 1979, and 9% in 1980 and later years.
o.24      As can be observed in Annex 6.6, attainment of these targets would
enable EPM to cover a very substantial proportion of its financial requirements
(including its investments in ISA) from net internal cash generation, amounting



- 45 -
to 34% in 1978 and increasing thereafter. EPM is reviewing its investment
program for 1981-1984, which could result in somewhat higher investments,
mainly in distribution. As a consequence, the proportion of the program
financed by internal cash generation could be lower than shown in Annex 6.6,
but is still expected to be satisfactory.
Cvc 1/
6.25      CVC's financial situation has been poor in the past because it
charged inadequate bulk rates to its main customer, EMCALI. Its 1976-77
rate of return on revalued assets averaged less than 3% and it failed to
generate sufficient funds internally to cover its debt service in the latter
year (Annex 6.7). However, CVC has initiated a program of rate increases
which should lead to a considerable improvement in its finances. These
increases (equivalent in real terms to 12.2% in 1977-78), would allow CVC to
achieve a 5% rate of return in 1978 and to finance 25% of its investment
requirements from internal resources. Performance would improve further in
1979-80, when the rate of return would average 9%. Debt service coverage
would also be satisfactory, rising from 1.3 times in 1977 to 1.7 times in the
following year and remaining above that level thereafter. CVC agreed to
charge rates as required to achieve a rate of return on its revalued assets of
5% in 1978 and 9% thereafter.
6.26      The main item in CVC's investment program is the Salvajina Multi-
purpose Project (4.02) which the IDB and the Japanese Government have been
requested to finance. CVC would require Government contributions of MCol$ 600
to undertake Salvajina.
ICEL
6.27      ICEL functions essentially as a holding company for eleven local
power utilities (2.15). It does not have any revenues of its own and its
expenses, debt service and investments (including its contributions to ISA)
are covered with Government budgetary appropriations. ICEL's largest
subsidiaries are currently applying monthly tariff increases similar to those
approved by other utilities.
CORELCA
6.28      CORELCA's system depends entirely on thermal generation.  The Govern-
ment provides a heavy subsidy to CORELCA in the form of low oil prices.
Despite this subsidy, the utility's operating costs are substantially higher
than those of other bulk suppliers in Colombia, which generate most of their
power in hydroelectric plants. These costs have not been adequately reflected
in CORELCA's rates, and its financial performances has been poor. CORELCA's
1/   This section and Annex 6.7 cover the financial projections of CVC and
CHIDRAL's power generation and transmission activities, which include
the Yumbo coal mine. Other CVC activities (2.14) are excluded.



- 46 -
rate of return, on revalued assets averaged 4% in 1976-77 and it relied on
Government contributions and borrowings to finance its entire investment
program and part of its debt service. CORELCA has recently started to convert
its thermal plants to burn natural gas (which is available in very large
quantities in its service area); this should result in some reduction in
the adverse economic impact of the Government's fuel subsidy. Over the longer
term, however, the subsidy will have to be eliminated to encourage a rational
use of energy resources.
6.29      The imeasures agreed under the proposed loans would lead to a gradual
increase in CORELCA's fuel costs, accompanied by sizeable rate increases to
offset these higher costs and improve the utility's financial performance.
Except in 1978 and 1981, CORELCA's internal cash generation would cover debt
service; the utility would gradually reduce its dependence on Government
contributions after 1982. Because of the size of its investment requirements
(arising from the planned development of thermal generation based on the
E:L Cerrejon steam-coal deposits) CORELCA will require sizeable support from
the Government through the latter year (Annex 6.8). CORELCA agreed to charge
rates as required to achieve rates of return on its revalued assets of 4% in
1978, 5% in 1979-80, 6% in 1981, 7% in 1982 and 9% thereafter. The Government
agreed that beginning in 1978 it would gradually increase prices for the fuel
purchased by CORELCA so that by the scheduled commissioning of the 500-kV
IrnterconnectiorL (1982) it would be more costly for CORELCA to generate electricity
irn its own thermal plants than to purchase it from ISA.
Performance Indicators and Reporting
6.30      Over the project implementation period, ISA is expected to generate
an. increasing share of the power sold by its shareholders and to achieve
generally satisfactory financial performance. Based on their projected
financial data, ISA's shareholders with the exception of ICEL and CORELCA
would achieve satisfactory levels of debt service coverage. ISA and the
shareholders would finance a high proportion of their investments with funds
derived from consumer charges. The expected performance of ISA and the
shareholders is reflected in the forecast indicators in Annex 6.9, which would
be used as a basis for monitoring performance during project execution.
6.31      ISA and its shareholders agreed to report quarterly on their
performance in mneeting the agreed revenue targets. In addition, ISA agreed
to include in its quarterly reports on the progress of the two projects,
deltailed information on its financial condition and the status of payments
from the Government and the shareholders to ISA. These reports should enable
ISA and the Bank to identify any deviations from the agreed financial
performance early enough to permit timely corrective action.

7.   ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
7.01      San Carlos I would be the largest facility in the integrated system.
It would be located near the center of the load in the central system but
would also allow acceleration of development of energy-intensive heavy industry
on the Atlantic coast. It would be complemented by the 500-kV interconnection
between the predominantly hydro-oriented central system and the thermal-operated
northern system, which would ensure integrated optimal operation (with consider-
able reduction in fuel cost and reduced requirements for overall capacity
reserves). Both projects are urgently required to avoid a recurrence of the
power rationing experienced in early 1977.
Comparison of Alternatives
7.02      Three alternative development programs were examined (Annex 7) for
an integrated system (the main differences are replacement of hydro plant by
thermal plants to meet the same requirements and reliability) and two for the
systems to remain isolated, under average water availabilities, using appro-
priate border prices, and the opportunity cost of capital in Colombia (esti-
mated to be 11%) as the decision-making paremeter. This comparison shows that
the present worth of the cost of the program with the highest proportion of
hydro development would be least up to a discount rate of 12.5%. Sensitivity
analysis indicates that the equalizing discount rate would decrease to 10.5%
if there were a 15% reduction in fuel cost (resulting from the maximum possible
use of coal and natural gas). However, average hydro conditions have been
assumed for the comparison of alternatives, which do not reflect the consider-
able amount of oil-fired generation in the central system during drier years.
Because of the need to maintain a minimum level in the system's reservoirs
during dry years, the amount of thermal generation increases more than propor-
tionally to the amount of thermal capacity installed. It was therefore
concluded that, on balance, the almost exclusively hydro development is more
attractive economically and techically than a program which includes a higher
proportion of thermal plant. The thermal plant included in the program
selected is mainly required for reserve purposes and operation during below
average water years. Comparing this program for an integrated system with
isolated developments shows least-present value of costs up to a discount rate
of 45% (indicating the high economic benefits of interconnection).
Return on Investments
7.03      The return on investments is the discount rate which equates the
present value of the cost and benefits streams associated with a project (at
constant prices) during the lifetime of this project using appropriate border
prices. The cost streams comprise capital cost (including, for San Carlos I,
a commensurate distribution network development) and operating cost (including,
for Interconnection, thermal energy to be transferred) and maintenance cost.
The benefit streams comprise the average revenue for the regions to be
integrated (USJ1.4/kWh), taking into account losses and the consumption
conversion factor (for border pricing) and, in the case of the Interconnection
Project, the cost avoided due to reduction (250-300 MW) in overall capacity
reserves required for maintaining the same degree of system reliability.






- 51 -
7.04      San Carlos I.  The rate of return on San Carlos I alone is 7.5% when
the standard Colombian consumption conversion factor of 0.785 is used (Annex
7). While this return is of little significance as a measure of the economic
worth of the Project, it reflects the inadequate tariff policies pursued in
the past. It should also be noted that the tariff rates (and, consequently,
this rate of return) do not adequately reflect the expansion in .riadustrial and
commercial activities, increased employment opportunities and the social
benefits of public lighting and domestic supply. Although the consumers'
surplus (with respect to electricity) has not been measured, it is probably
high because rates are low by any standard while the negligible effects of the
recent rate increases on electricity usage indicate a wide margin within which
the consumer is prepared to pay for electricity. The proliferation of captive
plant during periods of restrictions is a further indication of this surplus.
For this reason it appears appropriate to assume that a consumption conversion
factor of 0.9-1.0 is applicable to electricity, in which case the rate increase
required to achieve a return on investment approximating the opportunity cost
of capital in Colombia (estimated at about 11%) would range from 25-35%.
Since ISA's major shareholders will have to introduce rate increases within
this range to achieve the financial performance targets specified in Chapter
6, the attainment of an 11% rate of return on the San Carlos I investment,
based on revenue considerations alone, appears reasonably assured.
7.05      500-kV Interconnection.  The rate of return on the Interconnection
Project alone is high, about 35%, indicating that the project is overdue.
The return would exceed 11% even if all costs were to increase (or all
benefits decrease) by 50%.
7.06      San Carlos I plus 500-kV Interconnection.  Considering both Projects
combined as an isolated incremental investment, the rate of return is 12.7%.
A sensitivity analysis shows that the overall rate of return would range from
10% to about 14%, the higher figure representing a 25% rate increase (with a
consumption conversion factor of 1) in real terms and the lower a 20% increase
in capital cost combined with a 20% decrease in fuel cost.
7.07      The returns on investment discussed above indicate that, once the
rates have been increased by ISA's shareholders as agreed, the average level
of the rates will be in approximate accordance with marginal costs. Consider-
able efforts will be required to improve the tariff structures to align charges
for different classes of service with the respective marginal cost. The study
described in 1.30 would provide the data on the cost of service to final con-
sumers needed to prepare a program of action in this area.
Risks
7.08      As noted in 4.23-29, the San Carlos I Project is subject to the
risks normally associated with large civil works in difficult terrain, while
the 500-kV interconnection faces somewhat lower technical risks (5.23). The
design and construction program for both projects makes adequate provisions
for such risks. Both projects are subject to considerable institutional



- 52 -
uncertainties, and financing of San Carlos I will depend on the expected
improvement in financial performance of ISA and its shareholders. The
substantial economic benefits which will accrue to the economy as a result of
the two investments and the agreements reached with the Government, ISA and
its shareholders to improve sector finances, provide sufficient assurance to
justify proceeding with the projects.

8. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
8.01      During negotiations agreement was reached on the following principal
points.
A. San Carlos I Hydro Power Project
Studies
8.02      (a)  The Government would present to the Bank before
June 30, 1978 the institutional and financial part
of the ongoing sector study (1.32) and by September
30, 1979, the part pertaining to hydro surveys afid
the long-term development program (1.23). ISA would
carry out before December 31, 1979 a Power Sector
Development Master Plan for 1980-2000 and its share-
holders a similar plan for distribution as part of
ISA's Master Plan (1.24).
(b) ISA's shareholders would carry out a tariff study
(1.30).
(c) ISA, with the assistance of its shareholders would
carry out a study of the losses in its own system and
those of its shareholders (3.02).
(d) ICEL would present to the Bank by December 31, 1979 a
management, planning, operations and finances study of
at least five of its subsidiaries (2.15); CORELCA would
present a similar study by June 30, 1979 (2.16).
General
8.03      (a)  ISA and its shareholders would not undertake construc-
tion of generating plant of respectively 200 MW (ISA)
and 100 MW (shareholders) unless economically justified
and provided suitable financing is available (1.25).
Additionally, ISA would not undertake any further project
costing in excess of 2.5% of the value of its net fixed
assets (6.16).
(b) Any changes in ISA's bylaws without prior agreement of
the Bank would be an event of default (2.02).
(c) ISA's shareholders would not transfer any assets or take
any action that would interfere with their compliance with
their obligations to ISA (6.17).



- 54 -
Proj ect
8.04      (a)  ISA would take adequate environmental measures and, not
later than DecemB'er 1>. 1981 formulate a nrogram for
rational use of the Project basin and organize a unit for
carrying out the program (4.22).
(b)  The shareholders would finance all costs of the Project
not covered by loans, in the following proportions: EEEB,
19%; EPM, 22%; CVC, 16%; ICEL, 30%; and CORELCA, 13%
(6.10).
Financial
8.05       (a)  ISA would recover from any shareholder the financial cost
arising from borrowings incurred by it to cover cash short-
falls caused by delays in receiving payments from that share-
holder and would apply payments made by its shareholders
in te following order of priority: energy sales, equity
subscriptions, bond subscriptions; ISA's shareholders would
reimburse ISA by December 31, 1979 for amounts due on account
of depreciation for 1977 and earlier years and pay all other
amounts within 60 days of billing; the Government would
make available to CVC, CORELCA and ICEL any funds they may
require to fulfill their financial obligations to ISA; it
would also assist EEEB and EPM in securing any loans they
may require similarly (6.02).
(b)  ISA, EEEB, EPM, CORELCA and CVC/CHIDRAL would continue to
revalue their assets annually (6.05).
(c)  ISA and its shareholders would achieve not less than the
following rates of return:
ISA - (i)  All assets excluding te 500 kV facilities:
5.5% in 1978, 8% in 1979, 9% in 1980, 11% in
1981, and 9% in 1982 and thereafter (6.13); and
(ii)  500 kV facilities:  3% in 1982, 2% in 1983, 2.5%
in 1984, 4% in 1985, 6% in 1986, and 9% in 1987
and thereafter (6.14);
EEEB   -   12% over the period 1978-80 and thereafter (6.20);
EPM    -   7% in 1978, 6% in 1979, and 9% in 1980 and there-
after (6.23);
CVC    -   5% in 1978, 9% in 1979 and thereafter (6.25); and



- 55 -
CORELCA -  4% in 1978, 5% in 1979 and 1980, 6% in 1981,
7% in 1982 and 9% in 1983 and thereafter. The
Government would, beginning with 1978, gradually
increase prices of CORELCA's fuel so that from
1982 onward it would be more costly for CORELCA
to generate thermal energy than to purchase it
from ISA (6.29).
(d) ISA's shareholders would reinvest any dividend (or debt
service on ISA bonds) during the Project construction
period (6.08) and thereafter any time ISA would fail to
meet the 1.5 annual debt service test; and would present
to the Bank not later than December 31, 1978 a review of
ISA's 1979-85 financing, including proposals for achieving
annual debt service coverage of not less than 1.5 times
(6.15).
(e) ISA's shareholders would perform their obligations under
their sales agreement with ISA (6.12).
(f) ISA would not borrow without the agreement of the Bank
unless it can meet a debt service test (6.16).
B. 500-kV Interconnection Project
8.06      (a)  The Government would by December 31, 1981 take all necessary
actions to ensure that ISA would own and operate the 500-kV
facilities (5.01).
(b) Acquisition of the land required for the substations would
be completed by December 31, 1978 and for the line (including
rights-of-way) by June 30, 1979 (5.18).
(c) ISA would prepare by December 31, 1978 a satisfactory program
for the training of staff required to operate the system and
implement it thereafter (5.23).
(d) The Government would finance all costs (including debt
service) of the Project not covered by loans (6.11).
8.07      The provision applicable to ISA described in 8.03(a) and (b), and
8.05(a), (b), (c) and (f) would also apply under the 500-kV Interconnection
Project.
8.08      The following would be conditions of effectiveness of the San Carlos
I Project.



- 56 -
(a) Satisfactory progress should have been made in implementing
the first part of the evacuation program for the project
area (4.21).
(b) ISA should have complied withthe conditions precedent to
the first disbursement of the IDB loan and made satisfactory
arrangements for financing the balance of the foreign exchange
requirements (6.09).
(c) ISA and its shareholders should have entered into a satis-
factory sales contract for the Chivor I power (6.12).
8.09      The following would be conditions of effectiveness of the 500-kV
Interconnection Project:
(a) A satisfactory agreement should have been signed between
the Government and ISA for the financing and execution of
the Project (5.01).
(b) Satisfactory arrangements should have been made for financing
the balance of foreign exchange requirements (6.11).
(c) Consultants should have been employed for special services
related to supervision of execution of the works (5.15).
8.10      With the assurances listed above, the projects would provide a
suitable basis for loans of MUS$126 and MUS$50 to ISA and the Government,
respectively.  The loans would be repaid over a period of 17 years with
4 years of grace.

COLOMEBIA
SAN CARLOS I HYDRO POWER AND 300-kV INTERCONNECTION PROJECTS
Description of ISA's Shareholders
Empresa de Energia Electrica de Bogota
1.        EEEB is an autonomous company, owned by the Municipality of the
Special District of Bogota, which generates, transmits and distributes
electricity. It serves some 458,000 consumers in metropolitan Bogota
directly and sells power in bulk to ICEL's subsidiary in the department
of Cundinamarca  EEEB has received three loans from the Bank totalling
MUS$85.6, which have been fully disbursed. A Project Performance Audit!!
on the most recent loan (537-CO of August 2, 1968) concluded that EEEB
was a well-managed utility, and that the project was successfully executed,
although financial performance was not as good as expected.
2.        EEEB is administered by a 7-member Board of Directors and
a General Manager. The Mayor of Bogota, or his representative, serves as
the Chairman of the Board of Directors. The General Manager, who is
responsible for the day-to-day management of the company, is appointed by
the Board subject to the Mayor's approval. EEEB's management is adequate
for the execution of its expansion program and for the operation of its
facilities.
3.        EEEB has an installed capacity of 717 MW, 581 MW from hydro
and 136 MW from thermal power stations. EEEB has asked the Bank to provide
finance for the Mesitas hydro project (520 MW), which has been approved by
ISA and is scheduled to come into operation by mid-1982, and for the
expansion of transmission and distribution facilities. The Mesitas project
was appraised in December 1977/January 1978 and a report is currently
being prepared.
Empresas Publicas de Medellin
4.        EPM is an autonomous company, owned by the Municipality of
Yedellin, which provides power, water, sewerage, and telephone services for
the city of Medellin and vicinity. It serves some 247,000 power consumers
in metropolitan Medellin and sells in bulk to ICEL's subsidiary in the
department of Antioquia. EPM has received four loans from the Bank totalling
MUS$129. A Project Performance Audit2/ on the third project (Loan 369-CO
1/ Project Performance Audit Report on Colombia: Third Power Expansion
Program (Sec M77-536 of June 29, 1977).
2/ Performance Audit on Colombia: Third Medelln Power Project (Sec
M74-376 of May 24, 1974).



ANNEX 2.2

of February 7, 1964) concluded that the project was worthwhile and that,
with the exception of the distribution component, it was well executed.
The most recent project financed by the Bank (Guatape II--Loan 874-CO) is
currently undcr construction and is scheduled for completion by the first
quarter of :L979, 15 months behind schedule. During construction dif-
ficulties have been encountered in relocating the population of El Penol,
which will be flooded by the Santa Rita reservoir, mainly because of poor
planning and excessive demands for compensation. Because closing of the
Santa Rita clam by mid-1978 is crucial to the proper operation of the
system, the Government and EPM have speeded up resettlement, and most of
the problems have now been solved with the help of various specialized
agencies (education, housing, sports, settlement, etc.).
5.         EP'M is managed by a 7-member Board of Directors and the
General Manager. The Mayor of Medellin, or his representative, is the
Chairman of the Board of Directors. After some difficulties resulting
from political interference in EPM by the municipal government, EPM's
management is now generally adequate and the improvements recently made will
increase its capacity to execute its expansion program and to operate its
facilities.
6.         The various services of EPM are managed as separate entities
with separate accouting systems. EPM has an installed capacity of 729 MW
(all hydro) and this will increase to 1,014 MW with the completion of the
Guatape II project. In addition to this project, EPM's investment program
for 1977-84 includes expansion in generation, transmission, and distribution
facilities, as well as the initial expenditures for the new Guadalupe IV
hydro station.  EPM has asked the Bank to provide finarring for this program.
Corporacion Autonoma Regional del Cauca
7.         CVC is an autonomous multipurpose State corporation under the
National Planning Department, responsibile for developing the Cauca
Valley. One of its main activities is generating and transmitting power in
the Valley, undertaken in part through CHIDRAL, which is owned by CVC
(65%), the Mlnicipality of Cali (17%) and Empresas Municipales de Cali
(EMCALI--18%). CVC-CHIDRAL sells power in bullk to EMCALI and other
distributing companies (subsidiaries of ICEL and CVC) serving a total of
some 250,000 consumers.
8.         CVC-CHIDRA1. has received five loans from the Bank totalling
MUS$44.6 (the last of which was made in 1963) which have been fully disbursed.
CVC-CHIDRAL has an installed capacity of 598 MW (540 MW hydro, 58 MW thermal).
The CVC-CHIDRAL program includes the execution of the multipurpose
Salvajina project (intended mainly for flood control and irrigation) which
includes 180 MW of generating capacity, and the corresponding transmission
facilities.
9.         CVC is administered by a  7-member Board of Directors and an
Executive Director appointed by the President of the Republic.  CVC's various



ANNEX 2.2
Page 3 of 4
activitiesl are managed as separate enterprises with relatively independent
accounting systems. Some of CVC's generating and transmission facilities
are leased to and operated by CHIDRAL. CHIDRAL is administered by a
member Board rf Directors and a General Manager. EMCALI is responsible for
power distribution in the city of Cali and vicinity. It is a municipal
company which also provides water, sewerage and telephone services.
Corporacion Electrica de la Costa Atlantica
10.       CORELCA is an autonomous corporation created in 1967 (although it
has only functioned since 1972). It is responsible for power generation
and transmission in 7 departments on the Atlantic Coast. The 7 distri-
buting companies in the area are subsidiaries of CORELCA and buy power
in bulk from it. Together they have an installed capacity of 425-MW (all
thermal) and serve about 184,000 consumers. One of CORELCA's subsidiaries,
ELECTRIBOL, which at the time was a subsidiary of ICEL, received a MUS$5 Bank
loan (347-CO) in 1963, which is fully disbursed. CORELCA is in the process
of completing a 132-MW steam station. CORELCA's investment program until
1980-81 comprises 132-MW of gas-fired steam plant in the Barranquilla/
Cartagena area, the expansion of its existing power stations (25-MW), and
the expansion of its transmission system. A 125-MW steam station that is to
use coal from the Carrejon project is planned for commissioning in 1983.
From San Carlos I onward it will participate in ISA's generating and trans-
mission projects.
11.       CORELCA is administered by a 7-member Board of Directors
and a Managing Director. Its organization, budgeting, budget control,
administration and accounting require improvement to enable it to keep
pace with its rapid growth.
Instituto Colombiano de Energa _E_lctrica
12.       ICEL is a government institute, responsible to the Ministry of
Mines and Energy, which provides electric power services for the rest of
the country through 11 su'.sidiary companies in which it is the majority
shareholder (the other shareholders are the respective local governments).
ICEL's subsidiaries have an installed capacity of 543 MW (340 MW hydro,
203 MW thermal) and serve about 580,000 customers.  ICEL's role was initially
conceived as that of coordinating the development of the power sector. It was
not, however, successful in this function and its mission presently consists
largely of supervising the extension of service to smaller towns and rural areas.
In keeping with Government policy, ICEL will concentrate its activities in areas
not served by other entities. These are expected to be largely
1/ Which, in addition to power generation and transmission, include rural
electrification (carried out through the local subsidiaries); irrigation
and rural development; development of natural resources (including
operation of a captive coal mine for thermal power generation); and
operation of hotels.

ruraland the Government would continue to subsidize their electric power services
through ICEL. ICEL is also responsible for the investment program of most of
its subsidiaries, which essentially comprises expansion to the various
1:rp'nsmission and distribution systems connected to the interconnected system,
and generating additions to isolated systems. The projects executed by
:ECEL are transferred to its subsidiaries in the form of capital contribution.
Threel! of ICEL's subsidiaries have received four loans from the Bank,
totalling HUS'S14.6, which have been fully disbursed. ICEL is the executing
agency for the rural electrification component (US$2.1) of Loan 1352-CO,
which is proceeding well after some initial delays.
13.       ICEIL is administered by a 5-member Board of Directors (chaired
by the Minister of Mines and Energy) and by a General Manager appointed by
the President of the Republic. ICEL and its subsidiaries have organizational
and administrative problems, resulting from frequent changes in middle
management, low salaries, lack of qualified staff, poor accounting systems
and insufficient control by ICEL over the operations of its subsidiaries.

SAN CARLOS I HYDRO POWER AND 500-kV INTERCONNECTION PROJECTS
Operation of the Interconnected System--Load Dispatching
Overall control of the interconnected system is expected to be
instituted by 1981, when ISA's dispatch center would be operational. The
development of ISA's dispatch function since 1972 and tentatively for
future years, is the following.
1972-77. Because ISA's first power station (Chivor) was
not fully operational and a dispatch center is still in the design stage,
ISA's function was Limited to coordinating the operation of the systems
of its shareholders. It carried out this function in a modestly equipped
coordinating center in Manizales under an operation agreement dating from
1972. ISA's main tasks were:
(a) Each month ISA proposed a basic energy exchange program for
the following month. This program served as a basis for
calculating the guaranteed energy purchase and sale
commitments, and set the requirements for optimum use of
the system's resources.
(b) On a daily basis, taking account of each system's situation,
ISA prepared. an hourly program for least-cost energy
exchanges for the next day. Each sponsor then worked out the
detailed dispatching arrangement within its own system.
(c) ISA supervised performance in executing the exchange programs
and coordinated any changes required to take account of
unforeseen changes in generating availabilities or in demand.
1978-80. ISA will only operate Chivor I and sell energy to the
Central System. Because the dispatch centers, in Bogota (national dispatch)
and Medellin and Manizales (regional dispatch) which will be constructed under
a project expanding Chivor (Chivor II), cannot be completed before 1981, ISA will
still lack facilities for full supervision or control of operations in the inter-
connected system. ISA's functions would continue to be as described above.
1981 Onward. Although it is too soon to forecast the agreements
to be reached with respect to ISA's dispatch function, a rough outline of
the main requirements for efficient dispatch can be given. The dispatch
center would, inter alia:
(a) coordinate all aspects of dispatching with the system, at
all transmission voltage levels, that would materially
affect the reliability of supply and the interconnections
between subsystems;



ANNEX 3.4
Page 2 of 2
(b) have executive control over all 230-kV and 500-kV networks;
(c) automatically control frequency (using ISA's stations and those
plants in the system that are designated as regulating
stations) and voltages;
(d) operate all facilities to minimize total system operating cost;
(e) have total emergency control in situations where cascading
outages could endanger the system;
(f) would supervise and coordinate re-establishment of service in
the event of major breakdowns;
(g) program and coordinate maintenance of all generating facilities
and all 230-kV and 500-kV transmission facilities; and
(h) constitute an intersystems power sale and purchase pool; all
programming of future operations, in close cooperation with the
utilities connected, would be the responsibility of the dispatch
center which would register all aspects of pooling and invoice
the energy exchanges.

San Carlos I Hydro Power and 500-kV Interconnection Projects
Economic Analysis
500-kV System Benefits
1.        The benefits of the interconnection are sizeable, as the integration
of the two major power systems in the country will permit:
(a) Optimization of the hydro-thermal operation of the integrated
system, with consequent reduction in the incremental cost of
production and sharing of costs and benefits accruing from
such operation. Substantial savings in natural gas and imported
fuel oil can be achieved when CORELCA replaces parts of its
thermal power generation by hydro power available in the Central
system and operation is optimized.
(b) Support from CORELCA's thermal plant for the Central System during
the dry season (mid-December to mid-April). This is of fundamental
importance to avoid a recurrence of the outages experienced in early
1977 and the economic problems associated with power rationing.
(c)  Reduction in the overall capacity reserves required for main-
tairning the same degree of system reliability. These savings
in capacity are estimated to be some 250-300 MW (4-6% of the
1982 effective capacity). Assuming an average (1977) cost of
US$4OO-450/kW of generating plant; this would eliminate the
neecd for capital investments about equal to the cost of the
500--kV facilities at January 1, 1977 prices.
2.        The magnitude of the Project's benefits to the national economy is
such that the Government has decided to proceed with it, despite the fact that
the municipal utilities would not share in its cost.
ISan Carlos I E'roject Benefits
3.        The San Carlos I station would be the largest power generating
facility within the integrated system, averaging an energy capability of about
3.7 TWh/a at a plant factor of 0.68 during the first phase of 620 MW and 0.27
after completion of the second phase adding 930 MW.
4.        The main benefits of the Project would be the following:
(a)  Because the project is located near the center of the load in
the central system, it would permit the deferment of extra
high voltage transmission facilities (500-kV) in this system.
In addition, because it is closer to the Coastal system than

other potential new plants, total transmission losses would
be smaller than under any other possible generating project;
(b) The energy generated by San Carlos would be fully absorbed by
the growth of sales in less than two years from the date of
commissioning; and
(c) The pace of energy-intensive heavy industrial development on
the Atlantic coast could be stepped-up, thus accelerating the
prospects for exports of petrochemicals based on the region's
abundant natural gas resources.
Comparison of Alternative Power Development
5.        Alternative power developments to meet energy requirements through
1985 were examined for average hydrology conditions as well as for adverse
conditions (20% and 5% probability of occurring), taking into account the
16-year records available. Because of high economic benefits of interconnec-
tion (para 13), it was assumed that interconnection would in any event take
place in early 1985 and that integrated development would be equal beyond
that year. The three alternatives (Program 1, 2 and 3) examined for an
integrated system and the two (Program 4a and 4b) for the systems to remain
isolated are shown in Annex 7.1, page I under average water availabilities.
These programs do not take into account (because the effect would be
negligible) the recent changes made by ISA to avoid rationing in the
early eighties (4.02).
6.        The programs were compared using border prices (Annex 7.1, page 3)
for construction, labor, operating and maintenance costs including fuel,
and for the exchange rate. The cost of local construction labor was broken
down into skilled, semi-skilled and unskilled. Operating and maintenance
personnel were treated as skilled labor in view of the limited availability
of such personnel. The opportunity cost of capital in Colombia is esti-
mated to be about 11%. Border pricing was not applied to local supply of
materials and equipment; the effect on the conclusion would be minor since
these costs probably do not exceed 10% of the cost of the Project.
7.        Comparing Program 3 with Program 2, using the discounted cash flow
method, resulted in an equalizing discount rate in excess of 26% (the cause
is replacement of Mesitas hydro by a 250 MW thermal plant) and for this reason
Program 2 was rejected.l/ The comparison of Program 3 with Program 1 (Program 3
includes EPM's proposals for river diversions and additional generating plant
as proposed for financing by the Bank, which in Program 1 is replaced by gas
turbines) shows (Annex 7.1, page 2) that up to a discount rate of 12.5% the
present worth of the cost of Program 3 is less than that of Program 1.
Sensitivity analysis indicates that the equalizing discount rate would be
reduced to 10.5% if a 15% reduction in fuel costs (resulting from the maximum
possible use of coal and natural gas) is assumed. This rate is slightly below
1/   Since the unit cost of San Carlos I (US$67 per MWh of annual energy
capability) is lower than that of Mesitas (US$75), a program in which
San Carlos I was replaced by an equivalent thermal plant would be even
less economical than Program 2.

the estimated opportunity cost of capital in Colombia.  However, the analysis
based on average hydrology does not reflect the fact that - because of the
need to maintain a minimum level in the system's reservoirs during dry years -
the amount of thermal generation ncreases more than prcportirn2lly to the
amDunt of thermal capacity installed. For this reason, it was therefore
concluded that Program 3 is, on balance, more attractive economically and
technically than Program 1.
8.        Program 4 (independent development of the Central and Atlantic
systems) requires 293 MW in additional capacity over the integrated system
of Program 3, estimated to be equal in cost to the 500-kV interconnecting
facilities. It is obvious that the execution of Program 3, which avoids
the additional fuel cost incurred under Program 4, would have substantial
economic benefits. This was confirmed by comparing Program 3 and Program 4
(similarly to the comparison of Program 3 and Program I as shown in
Annex 7.1, page 2). Program 3 shows least-present worth of costs up to
a discount rate of 45%, compared with Program 4.
9.        The comparison of alternative development programs shows:
(a) Interconnection should be completed as soon as possible; and
(b) Program 3, which not only includes the San Carlos and Mesitas
Hydro Project, but also EPM's river diversion and generation
expansion related to it and 2 x uu rlW in steam plant (CORELCA)
constitutes the least-cost development program. 1/
Return on Investment
!LO.      The return on investment is the discount rate which equates the
present value of the cost and benefits stream associated with a project over
the economic 'Life of the project. Three calculations (Annex 7.2) were made
for the San Carlos I and 500-kV Interconnection Projects, using border prices
as indicated above for the comparison of alternatives:
(a) for San Carlos I Project,
(b) the 500-kV Interconnection Project, and
(c) both Projects combined.
11.       San Carlos I.  The cost streams comprise capital cost, including the
1980-1984 expansion in distribution networks commensurate with the San Carlos I
hydro development, and operating and maintenance cost related to these works.
1/   It should be noted that the 200 MW thermal capacity recently added to ISA's
progrEm (4.02) does not form part of this least-cost stream because the
latter hnas been defined under average hydrological conditions. This
capacity is required--for any of the alternative integrated developments--
to meet adverse hydrological conditions and for this reason could be
ommitted from the cost stream.



Annex 7
Page 4 of 5
As a proxy for the benefits the average 1976 revenue for the Central and
Atlantic Regions of USJ1.45/kWh multiplied by the standard consumption
conversion factor (0.785) was used, taking into account the San Carlos I
generation and deducting losses. The resulting return of 7.5% indicates that
the 1976 rates did not adequately reflect the average marginal cost of
service. The 7.5% return is of little significance as a measure of the
economic worth of the Project; while the full benefits of a kWh of electricity
have not been quantified reliably, they are believed to be several times the
current level of average revenue. Among the benefits that would not be fully
reflected in rates are the expansion in industrial and commercial activities
and employment resulting from the availability of a reliable supply of
electricity and the social benefits of public lighting and domestic supply.
12.       A sensitivity analysis (Annex 7.2, page 5) was carried out to
measure the impact of major uncertainties underlying the return calculation.
It may be summarized as follows:
(a) The return on investment would be substantially higher if
more realistic rates were to be applied that would enable
ISA's shareholders to meet both their financing needs for
expansion and their current obligations in a timely fashion.
Using the 0.785 consumption conversion factor, a rate in-
crease of about 50% would be required to increase the return
to 11%, the estimated opportunity cost of capital. However,
the application of this consumption conversion factor to power
revenues may not be justified because the consumers' surplus
(with respect to electricity), although it has not been
measured, is probably high. Rates are low by any standard
while the negligible effects on demand of the recent rate
increases indicates a wide margin within which the consumer is
prepared to pay for electricity. The proliferation of captive
plant during periods of restrictions is a further indication
of this surplus. Assuming that a consumer conversion factor
of 0.9-1 is applicable for electricity, a rate increase of
25-35% would be required to meet the incremental cost of
supply. Since ISA's major shareholders will have to introduce
rate increases within this range to achieve the financial
performance targets specified in Chapter 6, the attainment of
an 11% rate of return on the San Carlos I investment, based on
revenue considerations alone, appears reasonably assured.
(b) The sensitivity to changes in operational cost is negligibly
small. As noted in 4.23-4.29, the Project cost estimate is
subject to the uncertainties normally associated with large
civil works in difficult terrain. An analysis was therefore
carried out to determine the impact of cost increases over
and above the physical contingencies already included in the



Annex 7
Page 5 of 5
estimate. Within a reasonable range, the sensitivity of
percent changes in capital cost and in revenues is practically
eq[ual, except for the sign (a 20% increase in the cost of
the project decreases the return by about 1.5 percentage
points, a 20% increase in revenue increases the return by
about 1.5 pLLcentage points) and, provided that rates are
increased about commensurate with construction costs, the
return is insensitive to the combined equal percentage
increase in construction cost and revenues per kWh.
13.       500-kV Interconnection.  The cost streams comprise the capital cost
of the facilities, their operational cost and the cost of thermal energy to be
transferred from the Atlantic to the Central region. The benefits comprise
the cost avoided due to the reduction in reserve capacity required of some 250-
300 MW (para 1) because the interconnection line would be constructed, and
savings in fuel costs.  Because this reduction in reserve capacity is about
equal to the additional plant to be installed in CORELCA's system without
interconnection, it was assumed that the capacity saved is all thermal and
amounts to 293 MW (equal to the difference of Program 4 and 3, see para 8).
The resulting return is very high (35%) indicating that the Project is overdue
and, detailed sensitivity analysis was not deemed necessary. Changes in cost
and benefits beyond the range which can reasonably be expected must be assumed
in order to arrive at a return approximately 11% (e.g. all costs would have to
increase, or all benefits decrease, in excess of 50%).
14.       San Carlos I plus 500-kV Interconnection.  Both Projects were com-
bined by adding their costs and benefits respectively. Considering both
Projects combined as an isolated incremental investment, together with a
reasonable portion of the investments in distribution, the rate of return is
about 13%. A sensitivity analysis (Annex 7.2, page 5) shows the following:
Assumptions                         Rate of Return (%)
Basic                                                  12.7
25% increase in revenue
(a consumption conversion factor of I assumed)   13.9
20% increase in fuel cost                              13.5
20% increase in capital cost and
20% increase in fuel cost                           11.6
20% increase in capital cost                           10.8
20% increase in capital cost and
20% decrease in fuel cost
(i.e. increased use of coal
and gas and less fuel oil)                          10.0
Because the use of a higher consumption conversion factor appears appropriate
(para 12) and because capital cost increases and fuel cost may continue to
increase about commensurately for some time to come, the probability appears
high that the return on both Projects combined exceeds the opportunity cost of
capital by a comfortable margin, particularly if tariffs are, as is expected,
raised to adequate levels in the future.
