(LOAN 1583-CO)
HIGHLIGHTS
1.       The loan 1583-CO (US$50 million equivalent) helped to finance the
construction of the 523 km 500 kV line San Carlos - Cerromatoso-
Sabanalarga, which interconnected the Central and the Atlantic power
systems. The Project was successful in meeting its objectives oft (a)
decreasing the proportion of thermal generation in the Atlantic power
system from 1002 ex.sting prior to the interconnection to about 79Z in
1986; (b) supwoort4:ag the central system in the dry season beginning in
1982, when the line was provisionally energized at 230 kV; and (c) reducing
the investment in the new generating plants in CORELCA's system (paras.
4.1.1 and 4.1.2).
2.       The Project was completed in November 1985, about four and a half
years later than the target completion date.1 The main cause of delay is
attributed to the failure to complete the US$40 million cofinancing
arrangement with KfW for the foreign exchange costs of the substations
component. The withdrawal of KfW from financing that project component was
due to a disagreement between ISA and KfW over the awarding of the contract
for the circuit-breakers (para. 3.2.2). This obliged the Government and
ISA to look for other sources of financing; however, even though they
managed to accomplish this expeditiously, the contract signing took some
time to materialize (para. 3.2.3).
3.       The financial performance of ISA during the period of project
implementation was adequate, though the company experienced some financial
constraints due to the high amount of the shareholders arrears in
electricity purchases and capital contributions, higher inflation than
expected at appraisal, and ISA's commitment to the sector's ambitious
investment program, under which it participated simultaneously in the
construction of San Carlos, Jaguas, Guavio, and Betania hydroelectric
projects (para 5.1.1).
1/ The line was provisionally put into operation at 230 kV in February
1982, or 10 months later than forecast at appraisal.

PROJECT COIPLETION REPORT
COLOMBIA
500 KV INTERCONNECTION PROJECT
(LOAN 1583-CO)
I. BACKGL J
1.1 Bank LendinR to the Sector
1.1.1    Since 1950, the Bank has made 31 loans to the Colombian Power
Sector, totalling US$2.2 billion (Annex 1.1).
1.1.2    At the start of Bank lending, in the 1950s, the Bank's lending to
the sector was to individual utilities (CHIDRAL, CHEC, LEBRIJA, EPH and
EEEB). The objective was to expand the coverage of the electric service at
minimum cost in the area of each individual utility. However, the most
economical and large hydro potential sites were beyond the needs and
investment capacity of isolated systems; hence, interconnection and pooled
investments became a major objective in the second half of the 1960s. To
this end, the Bank strongly supported the creation of ISA (Interconexi6n
Eldctrica S.A.). ISA was created with the purpose of interconnecting the
regional power systems, defining the expansion program for the
Interconnected System, and developing large hydro sites. The Bank
subsequently made four loans to ISA. The first loan (575-CO), amounting to
US$18 million, helped to finance the 230 kV interconnection lines La Mesa-
Esmeralda-Yumbo and Esmeralda-Guatape, and the corresponding substations.
The second loan (681-CO), in the amount of US$52 million, helped to finance
the construction at Chivor I hydroelectric plant (500 MW). The third and
fourth loans (1582/1725-CO), amounting to US$126 million and US$72 million,
respectively, helped finance the construction of San Carlos I and II
hydroelectric plant (1240 MW). All facilities are operating
satisfactorily. Loan 1583-CO in the amount of US$50 million, which is the
subject of this report, was made to the Government of Colombia, which
transfe-r,d the proceeds of the loan to ISA to help finance the
construction of the 500 kV line, San Carlos-Cerromatoso-Chinu-Sabanalarga,
which would interconnect the Central and the Atlantic Systems. The service
of this loan would be made by the Government. In the early 1980s, the Bank
supported the creation of Financiera El4ctrica Nacional (FEN) to assist the
sector in tapping the domestic and external capital markets to fund its
heavy financing needs. At present, in the context of the Power Sector
Adjustment Loan (US$300 million) made in 1987, the Bank is focusing its
efforts on improving the efficiency of the weaker utilities in the power
sector, strengthening sector finances and providing reliable electric
service at minimum cost to the country.



2-
1.2 Power Sector Organization
1.2.1    Six main utilities currently dominate the power subsector: Empresa
de Energia Electrica de Bogota (EEEB), Empresas Pdblicas de Medellin (EPM).
and Corporaci6n Aut6noma Regional del Cauca (CVC) are strong, independent
utilities serving the major markets (Bogot4, Medellin, and Call).
Instituto ColombiRno de Energia Electrica (ICEL) is the main shareholder of
thirteen smaller utilities; Corporaci6n Electrica de Costa Atlantica
(CORELCA) is the main shareholder of nine utilities; and Interconexi6n
Electrica, S.A. (ISA) is a generation and transmission utility. Five other
smaller utilities play a minor role.
1.2.2    EEEB is a large utility (800,000 customers, 3,800 employees)
serving the city of Bogota. It is fully owned by the municipality of
Bogota. EPM is fully owned by the municipality of Medellin, Colombia's
second largest city. It operates power, water, sewerage and telephone
services. It is responsible for serving about 10 of the customers and
represents 2z02 of total national electricity sales in the country. CVC is
a regional development corporation whose main function in the sector is to
sell bulk power to the integrated system, mainly to the distribution
company serving Cali (EMCALI).   CORELCA and ICEL are fully owned by the
Government and together account for about 502 of the customers and 352 of
electricity sales. Both companies serve generally poorer and isolated
market areas. ISA is a utility owned by EPM, CORELCA, ICEL, CVC, EEEB and
CHEC. It has the responsibility for generation, interconnection of
regicnal systems, operation of the integrated system, and sector planning.
1.2.3    ISA was established in 1967 as a corporation whose shares were
owned by the regional and municipal utilities. The Bank played an
important role in ISA's establishment, which reflected a concern dating
from the early 1960s with the fragmentation of decision-making power among
increasingly autonomous utilities. Initially, the Government was not
represented on ISA's Board. This changed in 1985 when ISA's by-laws were
amended to allow Government non-voting representation on the Board. The
lack of direct Government representation between 1967 and 1985 was an
important impediment which prevented the Government from taking effective
action to ensure that power sector policies were fully in line with macro-
economic programs. Initially ISA had the responsibility for building all
major generating plants. However, this task as well as its role in the
critical area of overall sector planning has been seriously constrained by
the strong pressures from individual region-based utilities to develop
their own generation facilities and their general resistance to
intervention. In 1979, at the insistence of the regional utilities which
were facing the threat of electricity rationing, the Government agreed to
permit the regional utilities to initiate their own generation projects.
However, it was agreed by the Government and ISA's shareholders that ISA
would operate the trunk transmission lines, act as national dispatch agency
and, in the long run, own at least one-third of the total generation
capacity in the sector. In retrospect, the decision to allow the regional
utilities to own and to construct large generation projects was not sound,
since it led to competition among them for projects in their respective
areas without due consideration of national interests. This weakened ISA's
ability to ensure that the investment program constituted the national



least-cost solution and to adjust programs to changing circumstances. Once
projects were included in the investment programs of the municipal or
regional utilities, ISA lacked the authority to adjust the pace of
execution to take into account changes in demand. To solve these problems,
under the Sector Adjustment Loan, the Government agreed that in order to
achievs a harmonious development of the power sector and guarantee the
execution of the least-cost plans, all generating plants with an installed
capacity of more than 100 MW will be owned by ISA (with the exception of
Urra I Project).
1.2.4    The Ministerio de Minas y Energia (MME) plays an important policy
and regulatory function in the power sector and, specifically, is
responsible for issuing regulations on the provision of electricity and on
technical standards. The tariff board, JNT (Junta Nacional de Tarifas)
which is under the Departamento Nacional de Planificaci6n (DNP), is
empowered under Decree 201 of 1974 and Decree 149 of 1976 to set
electricity tariffs. Since 1986, the Government has established clearly,
in policy directions and by law, that JNT sets the actual tariffs to be
charged, and the utilities generally have been complying with the JNT's
tariff resolutions.
1.2.5    Another sector institution is FEN (Financiera Eldctrica Nacional),
a financial intermediary set up by the Colombian Government in 1982 to help
finance the investment programs of the power sector, oversee the sector's
finances, and coordinate the sector's financing strategies. FEN's
shareholders are the National Government (95Z) and the sector utilities
(5?). FEN has recently begun to act as advisor to the Government on
financial issues facing the sector.
1.3 Power Demand
Electricity use is extensive in Colombia and is increasing at
rates higher than those for total energy consumption. About 58? of
Colombia's population of 28.4 million had access to electricity in 1985.
Electrification is higher in urban areas (about 95? in Bogota, Medellin and
Cali), but large areas of the country still lack electricity service.
Electric power provided 28? of total commercial energy in 1985, which
compares with 24? in 1980. The increasing share of electric power in total
energy consumption is largely the result of gradual substitution of oil
products and nontraditional fuels by electricity, mainly in the residential
sector.
II. PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
2.1 Origin and Rationale for the Project
2.1.1    The 500 kV Interconnection Project had its origin in discussions
held in October 1974 between ISA and the Bank staff during the supervision
of Loans 575/681-CO. Initially CORELCA, in cooperation with ICEL, was
authorized by the Government to build the project. However, the Bank was
opposed to this scheme because it considered that the Project could more



-4-
suitably be built by ISA, which was the Colombian utility charged with the
interconnection responsibilities. ISA at that time was facing some
financial constraints and, perhaps forced by this situation, preferred that
the project be built by CORELCA. Under this circumstance, the Bank was
willing to go along with the project provided thats a) the loan be made to
CORELCA and ISA, b) CORELCA become ISA's shareholder, and c) the line be
transferred to -- and operated by -- ISA, once it was completed. CORELCA
becoming ISA's shareholder became an issue because of the amount of
CORELCA's share of capital stock and the need for CORELCA to adopt ISA's
expansion program. Later on these problems were resolved and CORELCA
became a shareholder of ISA (para. 2.2.3).
2.1.2    The objectives of the project weres (a) to link the Atlantic Coast
and Centra.l systems which at that time were totally thermal and
predominantly hydro, respectively; (b) to substitute some hydro for thermal
generation; and (c) to obtain savings on equipment through reduced capacity
reserve requirements.
2.2 Project Preparation and Appraisal
2.2.1    The feasibility study for the project was prepared by a Colombian
and an American consultant hired by ISA and CORELCA. The detailed
engineering and the preparation of bidding documents was done by the
Colombian consultant, assisted by a British consultant.
2.2.2    During project preparation, the Bank had the opportun.ty to
comment on the feasibility study prepared by the consultants; those
comments were taken into account in the final version of the study.
2.2.3    The Bank sent seven preparation missions between October 1974 and
project appraisal in May 1977. Although the feasibility atudy was ready in
March 1975, it was necessary for the Bank to postpone the departure of the
appraisal mission several times as there were issues that took time to
solve, particularly the incorporation of CORELCA as a shareholder of ISA,
the ownership of the line, definition. of the borrower, and improvement in
the finances of the power companies. After lengthy discussions the Bank,
MME, ISA and CORELCA, agreed that CORELCA would be incorporated into ISA,
the interconnection line would be built by and would belong to ISA, the
Borrower would be the Government and tariff increases would take place
before negotiations. The other element that delayed project appraisal of
the interconnection line was that ISA at the same time was also processing
the loan for the San Carlos I Hydroelectric Project (which became Loan
1582-CO). The parties involved agreed that it would be more efficient to
have only one appraisal report covering both projects.
2.2.4    The appraisal took place in May 1977.  The mission found that ISA
and the Government had made substantial progress toward the solution of the
main issues and recommended that a loan amounting to US$50 million be
processed. It was agreed that before negotiations ISA and the Government
would do the following: (a) ISA would confirm that it would change its by-
laws giving CORELCA full status as ISA's shareholder, indicating explicitly
that all future major system expansions would be owned by ISA -- and other
changes to give ISA more flexibility for an efficient administration and
operation of the company; (b) the Government would introduce tariff



-5-
increases of 20? for ISA and its shareholders, effective July 1, 1977,
except for EEEB for which the increase would be 1OZ; (c) ISA would confirm
its acceptance of the principle that it should earn a 9? rate of return on
existing transmission facilities; (d) the Government would propose a
program for increasing the prices of petroleum and natural gas for use in
electricity generation (para. 3.4.2); and (e) ISA would prepare the financial
projections of ISA and its shareholders, incorporating full asset
revaluation and tariff increases.
2.2.5    The interconnection project consisted of the following components:
(a)  a single-circuit 500-kV transmission line, 523 km long,
between San Carlos in the central region and the Sabanalarga
substation in the Atlantic (Northern) region;
(b)  two 500/230/34.5-kV terminal substations, each with an
initial capacity of 450 MVA, one at San Carlos and the other
at Sabanalarga;
(c) two intermediate 500/115/34.5-kV substations, each with an
individual capacity of 150 MVA, one at Cerromatoso and one at
Chin*; and
(d)  a shunt-reactive power compensation system with a capacity of
500 MVAr.
2.2.6    The appraisal mission estimated the cost of the project at
US$167.2 million (excluding interest during construction), with foreign and
local costs estimated at US$100.0 and US$67.2 million, respectively. The
project was estimated to be financed as follows:
Millions US$
IBRD                        50.0
KfW                         40.0
Suppliers' Credit           10.0
Government                  67.2
167.2
IBRD would finance foreign currency requirements for the transmission line
and its engineering costs; KfW would finance the foreign components of the
substations; the suppliers' credit would finance the remaining foreign
costs, and the Government would finance the local costs and the interest
during construction of any loan or credit.
2.3 Negotiations, Board Presentation and Effectiveness
2.3.1    Negotiations took place during the period of March 10-17, 1978, 10
months after appraisal. It was necessary to undertake a post-appraisal
mission in September 1977 in addition to two missions by the Loan Officer
for Colombia. The delay was caused partly by the slow way in which tariff
adjustments were approved as well as the slow preparation of financial
projections by ISA's shareholders. The biggest delay was created by the



- 6 -
approval of changes in ISA's bylaws to incorporate: (a) CORELCA as a full
shareholder; (b) the principle of reasonable rate of return on assets in
service; (c) the principle of least-cost development programs in ISA's
planning (the regions wanted to exclude some projects from the options to
be analyzed on the ground that those projects had already been assigned to
them); and (d) the rule that ISA would build and operate the future major
expansion. The Bank and the Colombians made a tremendous effort to fulfill
the conditions agreed to be resolved prior to negotiations. Even though the
Bank demonstrated flexibility by accepting a tariff adjustment lower than
envisaged at appraisal, and made a dated covenant the elimination of the
subsidy of fuel prices for CORELCA (see Annex 2.1, iii), there was
irritation caused by the delay. The Colombians formed the opinion that the
Bank's requirements seemed to be endless. With the benefit of hindsight,
it seems that the main reason for delay was the lack of preparation of
substantial elements of the project at the time of appraisal. Moreover,
financial projections and the changes in ISA's bylaws should have been
ready at the time of appraisal.
2.3.2    Negotiation of the loan was substantially completed during the
meeting held in Washington on March 10-17, 1978; however, there was one
issue that required still more time to be resolved. This was a covenant
for ensuring that ICEL, CORELCA and CVC --three of ISA's sihareholders in
which the Government had majority ownership-- would have '.;e necessary
funds for the sector projects they had been committed to rinance in part.
This point was solved satisfactorily and the Board approved the loan on May
30, 1978. Representatives of the Bank, ISA, and the Government signed the
Loan and Project Agreements on July 14, 1978. The Loan amounted to US$50
million; the term was 17 years, including 3.5 years of grace. The interest
rate was 7.5Z. April 1981 was set as the project completion date and June
30, 1982 for loan closing date.
2.3.3    The Bank declared the loan effective on October 17, 1978, one
month later than forecast at appraisal.
2.4 Major Covenants of the Loan Agreement
2.4.1    Annex 2.1 includes the major covenants of the Loan and Project
Agreements. The Colombian Government and ISA complied with their
respective major covenants, except regarding the rate of return and debt-
service coverage ratio, as explained in detail in Chapter V.
III. PROJECT EXECUTION AND COST
3.1 Initiation of the Prolect
3.1.1    Even though there was substantial delay between the appraisal
mission and Board approval, this did not affect the initiation of the
project, as ISA continued preparing the detailed engineering and bidding
documents for the project. The Bank also reviewed and approved some of
these documents at this time.
3.2 Timetable and Changes in the Project
3.2.1    Implementation of the Project ended in November 1985, or about
four and a half years later than the original completion date. It is



important to point out that the 500 kV line was completed in February 1982
and energized provisionally at 230 kV (para. 3.2.4). Annex 3.1 shows the
detailed works components and a comparison between the actual and forecast
completion dates. All the project facilities are working satisfactorily at
present.
3.2.2    The main cause of delay was the failure to complete the
cofinancing arrangements with KfW, which was going to fund approximately
US$40 million for the foreign exchange costs of the substation component.
The reason for this was the disagreement between ISA and KfW over the
awarding of the contract for circuit-breakers to a French supplier because,
according to the German development financial institution, the contract was
awarded to a bidder that did not meet the requirement of two years
experience, and this involved a technical risk, which was a deviation from
the tender terms established in the bidding documents. ISA, on the other
hand, presented a different view, arguing that: (a) the French supplier had
adequate experience, (b) KfW had accepted it as qualified bidder during the
bidding process; and (c) KfW raised its objection to the experience of the
bidder for the first time when it was analyzing the evaluation report. The
final decision of KfW not to sign the proposed Loan Agreement with the
Government of Colombia was communicated in December 1980. The Bank could
find no substantive objections to the contract award, but it did not try
early and hard enough to convince KfW of its position, even though the Bank
had known about this problem earlier as a result of project supervision.
3.2.3    The failure to sign the Loan Agreement with KfW obliged the
Government and ISA to look for alternative sources of financing. In the
meantime, ISA had to suspend the shipment and fabrication of some of the
substation equipment that was being manufactured by a Japanese supplier.
Even though there was a surplus of about US$8.2 million in the Bank loan,
the Bank did not propose that ISA use it to finance part of the substation
components. After some delay, the Government solved the financing problem
bys (a) entering into contracts with Export-Import Bank of Japan to finance
the contract for the transformers and reactors (this contract had been
awarded to a Japanese supplier and KfW had already accepted it for
financing); and (b) negotiating a loan with PARIBAS amounting to FF 113
million to finance the contract with a French supplier for the circuit-
breakers and ancillary equipment. Suppliers subsequently submitted claims
resulting from delay in the execution of the contracts, which were accepted
by ISA. As of December 1987, the balance of these claims represented about
US$4.0 million. These debts would be settled with funds that ISA would
receive from the government budget in 1988.
3.2.4    The transmission line, which was the component of the Project
financed by the Bank, was finished February 2, 1982, 10 months later than
forecast at appraisal. Because of the delay that already had been
anticipated in the completion of the 500 kV substations, ISA decided to put
the line into provisional operation at 230 kV using borrowed and rented
terminal and substation equipment. The cost of this additional work was
about US$0.5 million. The line operated at this voltage level between
February 1982 and November 1985.



-8-
3.2.5    As there was some surplus of the Bank loan, due to savings
obtalned in the construction of the line, ISA presented to the Bank in
August 1983, a request to use the balance of the loan of about US$8.2
million to duplicate the 500 kV transformer capacity at San Carlos and
Sabanalarga (to 450 MVA), to add spare transformer capacity (150 MVA) at
Chinu substation and to install all the respective connections, protection
and control equipment.  The Bank agreed to this financing in February 1985
after voluminous correspondence and a delay of about one and a half years.
The processing of ISA's request took many phases. First, the Bank informed
ISA in August 1984 that it did not agree to finance additional transformer
capacity, since it was not Bank policy to finance components which were not
included in the original project, and that the completion of this work
would require the extension of the closing date three years beyond the
original date, also not in keeping with Bank's normal practice. The Bank
proposed ISA to cancel the balance of the loan, retroactively to the date
of ISA's request, in order to avoid financial charges. Secondly, due to
the fact that the Bank could not finance the expansion in transformer
capacity, ISA requested in September 1984 that the Bank finance local costs
of the project. The Bank considered the request, but no final decision was
reached. Thirdly, the Bank finally agreed in February 1985 to ISA's
initial request to finance the expansion in transformer capacity. In
retrospect, it seems that the Bank might have done better to offer ISA
financing for part of the substation component of the Project when KfW
withdrew from financing it (para. 3.2.3), which had higher priority than
the expansion in the transformer capacity that will be fully utilized only
when a second 500 kV circuit comes into operation in early 1992.
3.3 Technical Problems During the Construction and Operation of the Line
3.3.1    The main problems found during construction and operation of the
line weres (a) construction of the foundation to support the towers was
difficult because of the instability of the soil in some parts of the San
Carlos - Cerrowatoso section, which crosses mountainous areas. During
construction, this problem was solved by increasing the size of the
foundations and/or making minor variations in the route of the line.
During the operation of the line, ISA has been actively monitoring the
stability of the towers and has taken adequate measures to ensure their
safety, such as cleaning and improving drainages and building protection
works. Though slides have occurred on slopes close to the foundation of
some towers, ISA has been able to repair them promptly; (b) corrosion of
the grounded structure was detected in the project construction in the
Carmen de Bolivar-Sabanalarga section, which is located in the coastal
area; and even though the tower bases were coated with anticorrosive paint,
the problem has continued. ISA is presently studying ways to permanently
solve this problem, and (c) about 902 of the insulators of the shield cable
were burned in a relatively short time of operation of the line, which was
designed to have total insulation between the shield cable and the tower.
After studying the problem, the solution found was to ground the shield
cable in each tower. This scheme has been working satisfactorily. As
regards the substations, the main problem detected was the damage suffered
to one of the autotransfonmers at San Carlos Substation at the time of
testing. Even though it was not clearly established that the failure was
due to imperfection of the equipment, the supplier agreed to repair it



under the supervision of its staff. Judging by statistics of operation of
the line, this has worked satisfactorily.
3.4 Restrictions in the Utilization of the Line
3.4.1    Annex 3.2 presents statistics of the operation of the line in the
period 1985-1987. The percentage of availability of the line for operation
is adequate. Forced outages are within acceptable levels and are due
basically to errors in operations, lightning and other natural phenomena.
Programmed outages seem to be rather high, but they are justified due to
the need to complete the installation of equipment and line maintenance.
Although the availability of the line is adequate, CORELCA does not use it
to its full capacity because there is a technical restriction imposed by
CORELCA system, which allows a maximum power inflow equal to the
compensating capacity of CORELCA through its generating plants, which at
the time is approximately 350 MW. The rationale for this criteria is to
avoid the collapse of the CORELCA system when the 500 kV line is
disconnected due to a line fault, because with an inflow of power larger
than 350 MW the system becomes unstable and may collapse if there is a line
fault. The operational reestablishment of the system is lengthy and
costly, which CORELCA is trying to minimize. This situation, which
prevents the use of the line to its full design capacity of 450 MW,l will
be corrected with the increase in reliability when the second 500 kV
circuit comes into operation, which is expected for February 1992. It is
noteworthy that the technical restrictions in the operation of the line
were not addressed in the SAR, probably because the second 500 kV circuit
was originally planned to operate one year after the first one. In
retrospect, the SAR should have analyzed the risk of a substantial delay in
the construction of the second circuit of the interconnection lines and its
effect on the overall project effectiveness.
3.4.2    The utilization of the line is also restricted, to some extent, by
financial considerations. This is due to the fact that the price that ISA
charged for the power sold to CORELCA is generally higher than the cost of
generating it by the latter. In 1987 the average cost of the energy bought
from ISA was COL$ 2.77/kWh, compared to COL$ 0.77/kWh which represented the
fuel generating costs of CORELCA plants. This low cost is influenced by
the heavy subsidy that exists on fuel.2   If this subsidy were removed,
CORELCA would have additional incentive to buy power from ISA. The Loan
Agreement included a covenant that indirectly called for the reduction/
elimination of the subsidy, because it established that the energy
generated by CORELCA would be more expensive than the energy bought from
ISA when the line was put into operation (Annex 2.1, iii). The Government
did not comply with the covenant and the Bank did not press the Government
to fulfill its commitment, perhaps on the basis that the utilization of the
line has been adequate, and that it is the technical restriction (para.
3.4.1), not the financial one, which puts major limitation on the use of
the line. The issue of the fuel subsidy has been addressed again in the
context of the Power Sector Adjustment Loan.
1/ This is given by the transformer capacity at Sabanalarga substation.
2/ At present, the cost of gas for CORELCA is US$ 0.35/MBTU compared to a
commercial price of about US$ 0.84/MBTU.

3.5 Project Costs
3.5.1    Annex 3.3 shows actual and forecast costs.  Excluding interest
during construction, the final Project cost was US$153.86 million (in
current prices) as compared with the appraisal forecast of US$167.2
million, or a cost underrun of 13.42. A more meaningful comparison is
between the project components that were planned and executed, which gives
an actual cost of US$143.22 million, or a cost underrun of 24Z. Savings
were obtained mainly in equipment and materials due to favorable prices
obtained through international competitive bidding.
3.6 Changes in Closing Date, Allocation of Loan Proceeds and Timing of
Disbursements
3.6.1    The closing date was postponed to December 31, 19e6, or 4-1/2
years later than the covenanted date. This was due to the fact that the
Bank honored ISA's request to employ the unutilized part of the loan for
works not included in the original project (para. 3.2.5). Annexes 3.4 and
3.5 compare actual and forecast data on disbursements and allocation of
loan proceeds by categories.
3.7 Performance of Consultants and Contractors
3.7.1    The feasibility studies were done by a Colombian and an American
consultant hired by ISA and CORELCA. The detailed design of the line and
substations was done by a Colombian consultant. ISA also employed an
English consultant to assist the principal consultant in the engineering
design, the preparation of bidding documents and in the bid evaluations.
The English consultant also assisted in the supervision and testing of
equipment and materials constructed abroad. A German consultant was hired
to perform a similar job regarding the equipment and materials for
substations. Due to the problem with the KfW loan (para. 3.2.2) this
contract was cancelled, and the work was completed by the English
consultant. ISA hired a Colombian consultant to perform the supervision of
the works. According to ISA and the Bank staff who supervised the project,
the performance of the consultants was satisfactory.
3.7.2    The principal contractor for the line work was a Brazilian-
Colombian-Venezuelan consortium responsible for fabrication, installation
and construction of the line.
IV. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
4.1      Need to Interconnect the Atlantic and the Central Systems
4.1.1    The main objective of the Project wes to interconnect the Atlantic
Coast and the Central System, which before the construction of the line,
were isolated. This would result in more economical development and
operation of the national power system, by substituting some hydro for
thermal generation, by supporting the Central System in the dry season and



- 11 -
by obtaining substantial saving in new plant installation due to reduced
capacity reserve requirements. The project would also strengthen ISA's
role as dispatch agency in the interconnected system.
4.1.2    The Project was successful in meeting its objectives by: a)
decreasing the thermal generation in the CORELCA system from 1002 existing
previous to the interconnection to 79Z in 1986, b) supporting the Central
System in the dry season beginning in 1982, when the line was provisionally
energized at 230 kV -- which was particularly important with the
occurrence of poor hydrological years, such as 1983 -- and c) reducing the
investment in new generating plants in the CORELCA system. Annex 4.1 shows
the evolution of the interchange of energy between the two systems for the
period 1982-1987 and Annex 4.2 presents the total installed capacity until
1980 and details of the different plants added through 1987, specifying the
year of commissioning.
4.2      Rate of Return on Investment
4.2.1    The appraisal included an estimated rate of return of 352
including in the cost stream the investment in the 500 kV line and
associated substations, the operation and maintenance costs and the costs
of the energy transferred to the Central System. On the benefits side, the
appraisal included the value of the energy transferred to CORELCA and the
estimation of the capital that would be saved due to the operation of the
line. In the reestimation of the rate of return presented in this report
(Annex 4.3), two minor changes have been introduced in the methodology of
estimation: i) the electricity transferred to the Central System has been
divided into normal transfer and emergency transfer. The electricity
transferred in emergency circumstances is included in the benefits side,
valued at outage cost or the average costs that for the economy represent
the rationing of electricity, and ii) the estimate has been prepared at
market prices (adjusted for transfer payments), instead of at border prices
used in the SAR.3   With these minor changes in methodology, the rate of
return is estimated at 302, which is close to the SAR estimate of 35X. If,
as in the SAR, the value of electricity transferred in emergencies were not
taken into account, the rate of return would be approximately 26?, which is
higher than the opportunity cost of capital in Colombia of about 12?.
4.2.2    There was no information available to estimate the capital savings
due to reduction in capacity requirement in a conventional way. In this
report the estimate of capital savings consists of a thermal plant of 205
MW, which would be necessary for CORELCA to build to produce 1441 GWh
(amount purchased by CORELCA from the Central System in 1986 and forecasted
for the period of life of the interconnection line) if the line did not
exist. But the interconnection line would be justified even if this
capital savings were not taken into account in the calculation. In this
case, the rate of return would be approximately 16Z.
3/ The rate of return calculated restating the data of the SAR in market
prices is 34?, which is similar to the one calculated using border
prices. This is so because the border prices in the SAR were
calculated for the investment in the project and the capital savings
for the reduction in capacity requirement produced by the
interconnection, which being of similar magnitude, offset each other.

V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
5.1      Comparison of Actual and Forecast Data
5.1.1    Annexes 5.1 through 5.4 compare the actual and appraisal forecast
income statements, sources and applications of funds, balance sheets and
key performance indicators for the period 1977-1986. ISA's financial
performance during that period was adequate, though it experienced
financial constraints due to the arrears of shareholders in their accounts
with ISA, higher inflation than expected at appraisal and ISA's commitment
to the sector's ambitious expansion program, under which it participated
simultaneously in the construction of San Carlos, Jaguas, Guavio and the
Betania hydroelectric projects. The financial indicators presented in Annex
5.4 show tnat the rate of :eturn was somewhat lower than covenanted.4   The
contribution to expansion was lower than that expected at appraisal,
ranging from 35.4Z in 1978 to 18.7Z in 1986. The lowest value was 1.12 in
1985. The debt-equity ratio and debt-service coverage ratios were
generally satisfactory, but deteriorated significantly in the period,
1983-86.
5.2 Tariffs
5.2.1    Average tariff, in current prices, increased from Col$ 0.361/kWh
in 1977 to Col$ 3.135 in 1986, or around 800%. In end-1976 prices, this
represents an average annual increase of about 3.1Z. The policy followed
by ISA and other power utilities in Colombia has been to make small monthly
adjustments in the tariff, which has allowed real increases. Preliminary
estimates made by ISA indicate that the average tariff of 1986 was about
502 of the long-run marginal cost (LRMC). This heavily subsidized tariff
affected ISA's finances and sent a wrong price signal to sector companies.
Under the Power Sector Adjustment Loan, approved in December 1987, the
Government agreed to continue the gradual adjustment in tariffs, having the
LRMC as a benchmark.
5.3 Accounts Receivable
5.3.1    The level of accounts receivable on electricity sales as a
percentage of annual sales revenues increased from 36.12 in 1977 to 68.82
in 1986, compared with 16.72 established as a performance indicator. The
level of this ratio was extremely high during all the years covered by this
report (1977-1986), and was one of the main reasons for ISA's financial
difficulties. Annex 5.5 shows the accounts receivable by shareholder for
years 1980, 1984 and 1987. Expressed in current US dollars, ISA's claims
against its shareholders were 77, 227 and 199 millions, respectively. The
accounts receivable, which consist mainly of amounts overdue from ISA's
shareholders for electricity sales and capital contributions, were
concentrated in EEEB, CVC, CORELCA and ICEL, companies that have
4/ The shortfall in operating income to fulfill the covenanted rate of
return was about ColS 10,490 million (US$65 million) for the period
1981-87.



- 13 -
experienced financial difficulties during the period. Partly due to this
situation, ISA had to negotiate loans with the Fondo de Moneda Extranjera
(FODEM) and the Government to cover the debt service. The Bank, during the
supervision of the project, pressed ISA and the Government to solve the
problem of overdue accounts receivable, without success, even though
measures were adopted, such as an increase in the rate of interest for
overdue balances and arrangement for payment of the overdue balances by
installments. This problem was also addressed in the context of the Power
Sector Adjustment Loan. It was agreed with ISA and the Government that all
past debt from its shareholders should be settled by end-1988.
5.4 Finances of ISA's Shareholders
5.4.1    Annex 5.6 presents the appraisal and actual annual level of
performance for the period 1978-1986 for EEEB, EPM, CVC and CORELCA, the
shareholders included in the SAR. Energy sales, debt service coverage and
self-financing ratios were lower than established at appraisal. This is
consistent with the financial difficulties experienced by the utilities,
with CORELCA and CVC the most adversely affected.5   The reduction in sales
was caused by the economic recession from which the country suffered during
the period; also, but to a lesser extent, to the occurrence of dry years
that made it necessary to ration electricitv. The debt service coverage
and self-financing ratios were affected by: (a) decrease in sales, (b) low
tariff adjustment, (c) high devaluation which took place which increased
substantially the outstanding debt and the debt service; and (d)
substantial increase in power sector energy lcsses, which increased from
17.7? in 1977 to 23.8? in 1986. To solve the sector's financing problems
for the period 1988-90, the Government negotiated the Power Sector
Adjustment Loan (US$300 million) to which a cofinancing package of about
US$1,030 million will be added. This loan also includes actions that would
be taken to improve the operational efficiency and financial conditions of
power sector utilities.
VI. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
6.1      ISA
6.1.1    ISA is a well-managed utility with high quality staff.  It
operates the interconnected system with modern technical standards.
6.1.2    Though the Project suffered from financial problems that delayed
its commissioning by about about four years, caused by the withdrawal of
KfW financing for the substation components, ISA acted satisfactorily under
the circumstances in the solution of the problem. However, Bank staff who
supervised the Project complained that ISA did not keep the Bank informed
of the problems that it was having with the KfW financing; and that had the
Bank known sooner, it would have had more opportunity to try to persuade
the German agency not to renounce the original agreement.
5/ No performance indicator was included in the SAR for ICEL, which
probably would also show inadequate performance indicators.



- 14 -
6.1.3    The prompt action that ISA took to develop an emergency plan in
order to provisionally energize the line at 230 kV made it possible to
begin the utilization of the line before the remaining project components
were completed.
6.2      The Government
6.2.1    Throughout Project implementation, the Government performed, for
the most part, satisfactorily, except in the area of financial support to
CORELCA and ICEL to the extent that these utilities needed to maintain
their accounts for energy purchases and capital contributions to ISA on a
current basis. The arrears of these utilities, as well of ISA's other
shareholders, was one of the main issues during the period of
implementation of the Project. The problem continues and is being
addressed in the context of the Power Sector Adjustment Loan. The
Government was slow in providing the funds or authorizing ISA to obtain
additional financing to cover the claims of contractors and suppliers, and
in persuading its agency (INCOMEX) to authorize expeditiously the licenses
to import equipment and material for the Project.
6.3      The Bank
6.3.1    The Bank's staff dedicated considerable time and energy toward
supervision of the Project and was generally responsive to ISA's requests.
Nevertheless, when the loan from KfW failed to materialize, the Bank should
have recognized that the financing of the substation's equipment was
critical, and should have proposed, early-on, that ISA use saving from the
loan of about US$8.2 million for this purpose. Even though this idea was
explored briefly within the Bank, it was abandoned on the grounds that the
Bank could not finance this equipment because it was not included in the
components of Project to be financed by the loan. Contrary to this
criterion, later in project implementation, the Bank agreed to finance
transformer equipment for the second 500 kV circuit between the Central and
the Atlantic Coast, to be in operation in early 1992. The Bank's agreement
to finance part of the substation's equipment, once KfW's withdrawal from
cofinancing of the Project was known, would have helped to speed up Project
execution.
VII. LESSONS TO BE LEARNED
7.1.1    In retrospect, it seems that the Bank should have devoted more
time to helping solve the problem created with the cofinancing. Although
the Bank was aware early on that ISA was facing some difficulties in
arriving at a final settlement with KfW, it failed to assist in the matter
promptly. When the cofinancing arrangement did not materialize, the Bank
should have proposed that ISA use the loan savings to fund part of the
substation's component.



- 15 -
7.1.2    As mentioned in this report, one of the main problems causing
ISA's financial constraints was that their shareholders accumulated
substantial arrears in payments to ISA for electricity sales and capital
contributions. The Bank did not press the shareholders hard enough to keep
their accounts with ISA current, even though there were specific covenants
under other Bank loan agreements with the shareholders that entitled the
Bank to take a strong position on the matter. Failure to do this made the
Bank lose credibility.

Maior Covenants of the Loan and Project Agreements
Performance of ISA and the Government under the major covenants of
the Loan and Project Agreements of the 500 kV Interconnection Project was
generally satisfactory, except as noted:
Loan Agreement
i)   Section 3.01 (b) required the Government to make available to
ISA the proceeds of the loan and an additional US$50 million for the
financing of foreign exchange and US$64 millionl for the financing of the
local costs of the Project.
ii) Section 4.02 required the Government to grant all necessary
authorization, import licenses, foreign exchange permits and approvals to
ensure the timely procurement of the goods and services required for the
Project. Part of the delay in the project execution was due to the slow
action of INCOMEX to issue the import permits required to release goods
from customs.
iii) Section 4.03 required the Government to increase the prices
for the fuel purchased by CORELCA, so that from the year 1982 it would be
more costly to generate electricity in its own thermal plants than to
purchase it from ISA.
Project Agreement
iv)   Sections 2.01 and 3.01 required ISA to carry out the Project
and manage its affairs with due diligence and efficiency and in conformity
with appropriate administrative, financial, engineering and public utility
practices and under the supervision of experienced and competent staff.
v)    Section 2.02 required ISA to employ consultants satisfactory
to the Bank to prepare the project design, to supervise the carrying out of
the Project and to inspect and test the equipment for the Project.
1/ This is the amount established in the Loan Agreement. However, the SAR
estimation was US$67 million.



- 19 -
ANNEX 2.1
Page 2 of 2
vi)   Section 2.07 (c) required ISA to prepare quarterly reports
on the carrying out of the Project, including detailed information of the
payments to ISA from the Borrower and furnish to the Bank such reports
promptly after completion.
vii) Section 3.04 required ISA to prepare a program for the
training of its staff responsible for the operation and maintenance of the
facilities included in the Project, furnish it for Bank comments and carry
out such program.
viii) Section 4.02 required ISA to audit its accounts and
financial statements by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank and
furnish to the Bank a certified copy of such statements not later than four
months after the end of each fiscal year.
ix)   Section 4.03 (a) required ISA to inform the Bank and give it
the opportunity to comment on any proposal for increasing its power
generating capacity by more than 200 MW, and not commit itself to projects
like that unless they were economically and financially justified. ISA was
also committed to obtain the Bank agreement if capital expenditures, other
than the ones agreed for projects financed with Bank participation,
exceeded 2.52 of the net current value of ISA's fixed assets in operation.
x)    Section 4.04 (a) and (b) required ISA to maintain tariffs
that generate a rate of return of at least 5.5Z in 1978, 8Z in 1979, 9Z in
1980, 11 in 1981, 9Z for 1982 and thereafter, on the average net current
value of its fixed assets in operation (excluding the assets of the
Project).2   ISA was also committed to maintain tariffs that generate a
rate of return of at least 32 in 1982, 22 in 1983, 2.52 in 1984, 42 in
1985, 62 in 1986, 9Z in 1987 and thereafter, on the average net current
value of the assets of the project once it came into operation. The
covenant also provided that the rate of return would be calculated in each
calendar quarter for the twelve monthp period beginning with such quarter
and the twelve months period immediately preceding, and that any shortfall
or overrun in the rate of return in the historical period would be carried
forward. Tariff would be adjusted accordingly if there were a shortfall in
the covenanted rate of return. ISA's actual rate of return was somewhat
lower than that covenanted (para. 5.1.1 and Annex 5.4).
xi)   Section 4.05 required ISA to seek Bank agreement prior to
contracting new long-term debt, if its future debt service coverage ratio
is less than 1.5.
2/ Under Loan 1725-CO (1979), it was agreed to have a common rate of
return for all ISA's assets. The covenanted rates, for 1979 and
thereafter, were the same as stated above.

COM-MENTS FROM THE BORROWER

Ref.: 500 kV Interconnection Project
(Loan 1583-CO)   -
Dear Mr. Buky:
Reference is made to your letter of March 21. 1991. received in our offices
only on April 8. 1991 and your Fax of May 11. 1991. Please be advised that aside
from some cowaents that will follow later, your document titled "Project
Completion Report - Colombia - 500 kV Interconnection Project (Loan 1583-CO).
February 6. 1991", coincides with the information presented to the Bank by ISA
in its final report under the title "Interconexion Electrica S.A. - Interconexion
with the Atlantic Coast Project - First Circuit, Final Report."
After review of the document it was found that the information regarding
costs does not differ from ours, however, in the descriptive information of the
project we did find differences that should be corrected as follows:
1.    Page 8, paragraph 3.2.5, fifth and sixth lines:
"Sabanalarga (450 MVA) and Cerromatoso (to 150 MVA), to add spare
transformer capacity (50 MVA) at Chinu Substation ..."
2.    Page 8, paragraph 3.3., Title
The title also includes the construction problems, however, the content of
the section makes 'only a passing mention of one of such problems under (a)
of paragraph 3.3.1. We suggest one of two things: either eliminate the
word "Construction" from the title or amplify with more detail such as it
appears in our final report presented to the Bank at the time.
Section 2.1.2, Special problems during construction

COMMENTS FROM THE EXECUTING AGENCY

INTERCONEXION ELECTRICA S.A.
Medellin, May 24, 1991
Nr. Jossef B. Buky

Re: 500 KV Interconnection Project (Loan 1583-CO)
Dear Mr. Buky:
Following our communication No. GG-91-4939 of May 17, 1991, I wish to add
some observations to the Project Completion Report on the aforementioned project
dated February 6, 1991.
1.    Section 3.5.1 - Project Cost:
This section makes reference to Annex 3.3 where the final cost of the
project is compared with the SAR estimated cost; there is an error in the
figures presented since they are shown as percentages where in reality
they are values, thus:
D I F F E R E N C E
SAR          ACTUAL         VALUE           (X)
Total Cost                 167.20         153.85         -13.35          8%
Final Cost without         167.20         143.22         -23.98         14%
including extension
of transformation
2.    Section 3.6 - Disbursement Plan:
Annex 3.4 shows the actual accumulated disbursements up to June of each
year. The real figures are as follows:

Dec. 31/78    -          Dec. 31/79    10.90      Dec. 31/80      30.00
June 30/79    1.50       June 30/80    22.20      June 30/81      33.50
1981-1982                1982-1983                1983-1984
Dec. 31/81   35.20       Dec. 31/82    38.60      Dec. 31/83      38.90
June 30/82   36.20       June 30/83    38.90      June 30/84      39.00
1984-1985                1985-1986                1986-1987
Dec. 31/84   39.00       Dec. 31/85    39.90      Dec. 31/86      40.50
June 30/85   39.20       June 30/86    40.30      June 30/87      48.50
1987-1988
Dec. 31/87   49.70
There are small differences with the information presented by ISA in the
project's Final Report.
3.    Section 5.1.1
Annex 5.4:   In 1985 the self-financing rate was 1.4Z and not 1.1% as
indicated in the Bank's report. This is because in Sources and Uses for
1985 the Bank made a reclassification in the "disbursements" and "working
capital" accounts.
The real Debt/Assets index had a satisfactory outcome in the period under
analysis since it was below SAR estimates. The real Debt Service Coverage
index was higher than estimated in the SAR except for 1983 and 1985 where
there was some deterioration.
It would be good if the Project Completion Report prepared by the Bank
explains the reasons for non-compliance in some indexes as indicated in
the final report presented by ISA.
4.    Annex 2.1 - Major Covenants of the Loan and Project Agreements:
Section 2.07 (c) Project Agreement: The company prepared and submitted to
the Bank, on a quarterly basis, detailed information on technical and
financial aspects of project execution.
Section 4.02: ISA has always used the services of an independent auditing
firm, as known by the Bank, to carry out the audit of financial accounting
statements and these were sent to the Bank in accordance with the
contractual provisions.
Section 4.04: Makes reference to the calculation of the rate of return
which can be seen in Annex 5.4 of the document. During the period 1978-
1980 the rate of return was met but in 1981 the established rates in the

SAR were not achieved.   However,  in the period 1988-1990 there was a
significant improvement in this index. Likewise, it is expected that with
the tariff measures adopted by the Government this index will recuperate
completely.
Section 4.05: Although the real indexes of Debt Service Coverage were
lower than the limits specified in the corresponding clause in the SAR,
ISA has always requested Bank authorization for new long-term investment
credits using the methodology agreed upon under Loan 1583-CO.
In view that the PCR presented by the Bank required a detailed analysis, please
forgive our delay in presenting these comments.
Sincerely,
Silvio Trujillo Acevedo
General Manager
