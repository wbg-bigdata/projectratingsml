1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1 Context at Appraisal

Country Background

1.1.1. Samoa is an island nation in the South Pacific with a total population of approximately 182,000
and, at appraisal, total GDP (gross domestic product) of $261 million. The population was (and remains)
predominantly rural, with two-thirds of the labor force engaged in agriculture. GDP per capita income at
market exchange rates was estimated at $1,525. Samoa experienced unsteady growth of GDP, and was
largely impacted by the contractions of the Asian economies from 1997 to 1999. The report of the
Commonwealth Secretariat/World Bank Joint Task Force on small states: “Small States: Meeting
Challenges in the Global Economy? (Washington, D.C., April 17, 2000), emphasized the economic and
administrative implications of remoteness, particularly when viewed together with the small size of
Pacific countries. Samoa was included in the group of highly-vulnerable countries, characterized by
highly-volatile economic growth, dependency on a limited number of exports, and a lack of economic
diversification (concentration of production created additional vulnerabilities).

1.1.2. The Pacific Strategy 2000 noted that development of the postal and telecommunications sectors
was considered crucial to development, and would create an environment wherein Samoa could overcome
the constraints of being a small-state, including, among others: economic and environmental
vulnerability, changing global trade regimes, and lack of institutional and human capacity.

1.1.3. Sector reform was consistent with the broader reforms that Samoa introduced. Since the 1990s,
Samoa became the leader in the Pacific in terms of forging ahead with fiscal consolidation and structural
reforms, thereby setting the economy on a relatively higher growth path than previously, despite still
remaining inevitably vulnerable to external shocks.

Sector Background

1.1.3. Samoa’s telecommunications and postal sectors suffered from structural limitations that hindered
their development, affecting, in turn, the competitiveness of the Samoan economy:

    (a) Limited coverage and access to the telecommunication network. Fixed-line telephone penetration
        was 6.5 per 100 inhabitants, while other countries in the same income group had an average
        penetration of 12. Mobile penetration was 1.7 percent, compared to 5 percent penetration in other
        countries with similar income levels. A waiting list of more than 1,500 customers for fixed and
        mobile lines indicated that there was room for growth. The fixed line backbone infrastructure
        (with low quality of service) needed upgrading and expansion.
    (b) High communications costs hindered the competitiveness of the Samoan economy. The price of
        international voice calls was high and did not reflect the real cost of service provision. This
        contributed to Samoa’s isolation and was considered a major obstacle to firms that operated in the
        export-oriented sectors. A three-minute phone call to the United States was priced 10 times
        higher than in Australia, and 64kbps dedicated lines were estimated to be priced at 10 times its
        cost.
    (c) Lack of adequate postal services. The collection and delivery of postal items by SamoaTel were
        extremely limited, and well below the standards of universal service set by the Universal Postal
        Union. Samoa lacked home and business delivery, and mail was delivered to mail boxes located

           in post offices. The average number of inhabitants per post office was 21,250 in Samoa;
           compared to 17,800 in Comoros; 2,400 in Fiji, and 11,500 in Mauritius.
       (d) Lack of effective sector regulation. The sector’s performance was hindered by the lack of
           adequate regulation. SamoaTel played the roles of both operator and regulator of the sector.
           Despite some policy and regulatory attributions given to the MCIT, the lack of a regulatory
           framework and legislation limited its capacity to regulate the sector. This situation created
           bottlenecks to sector development, as evidenced by the failure of SamoaTel and TSC (mobile
           provider) to reach proper interconnection agreements, thereby hindering the capacity of TSC to
           deploy a nationwide network.

1.1.4 The Government of Samoa (GoS) recognized the clear need for change, and requested assistance
from the International Development Association (IDA) to introduce reforms in both sectors.

Rationale for Bank Assistance

1.1.5. The proposed project was consistent with the Pacific Island Strategy 20001 noting that
development of the postal and telecommunications sectors was considered crucial to development, and
would create an environment where Samoa could overcome the constraints of being a small-state,
including: economic and environmental vulnerability, changing global trade regimes, and lack of
institutional and human capacity.

1.1.6. The World Bank/IDA had relevant and extensive experience in sector reforms in the region and
in other small-states around the world that could be used to reform Samoa’s telecommunications and
postal sectors.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved).

1.2.1 The development objective of the project remained constant throughout the project; it was to
assist Samoa to improve the performance of its telecommunications and postal sectors by: (a) increasing
competition and private sector participation in the telecommunications and postal sectors,
(b) strengthening its institutional and regulatory capacities, and (c) enhancing the provision of
telecommunications and postal services in selected areas.

1.2.2. Table 1 shows the key performance indicators (KPI) for the project from the Project Appraisal
Document (PAD).

    1.3.2. The KPIs were reduced (from the seven included in Table 1 to five) after the July 2007 mission,
    as the focus was directed on the telecommunication component. The final KPIs and output indicators at
    project closing are given in Table 2.

    1.4 Main Beneficiaries

    1.4.1. The project was designed to benefit consumers of telecommunications/postal products by
    increasing the access, quality, and lower the cost of the products. The components dedicated to capacity
    building would improve sector governance, competition, and liberalization. Combined, the project was
    expected to benefit all of Samoa’s users of telecommunications and postal services, and contribute to the
    strengthening of Samoa’s environment for economic development.

    1.5 Original Components (as approved)

    1.5.1      The project included five components to achieve the PDO:

               (a) Competition and Sector Reform ($0.73 total, $0.55 IDA financed),2 to finance: (i) technical
                   assistance to assist changes to sector legislation in order to increase competition, in the
                   accession to the World Trade Organization, and in the design of a postal policy;
                   (ii) engagement of advisors for the award of a digital cellular license; and (iii) professional
                   development (training, study visits).

        All dollars are United States dollars unless otherwise indicated.



                                                                  -4-
        (b) Regulatory Reform ($1.52 total, $1.23 IDA financed) to assist the Ministry of Information
            Communication Technologies (MCIT)3 to introduce effective regulation of the
            telecommunications sector and strengthen the regulatory capacity of MCIT to carry out the
            regulatory oversight functions of a modern, independent telecommunications regulator.
        (c) Corporate Reform of SamoaTel ($0.79 total, $0.59 IDA financed) included the assistance to
            explore options to privatize SamoaTel, and to carry out its privatization. This involved
            providing options to enhance the corporate performance of SamoaTel, including options to
            restructure and privatize SamoaTel. The project financed the technical assistance and the
            studies to be carried out, including advisors for privatization.
        (d) Postal Reform ($3.19 total, $2.03 IDA financed) was envisaged in two phases:
            (i)   Phase I involved technical assistance to the government to elaborate a postal sector
                  strategy, including introduction of competition, definition and implementation of an
                  adequate regulatory framework, extension of access, and review of the postal tariff
                  regime.
            (ii) Phase II included the investment to upgrade SamoaTel’s postal capacity, both on the
                 production side and the retail side.
        (e) Project Management Team ($0.10 total,$ 0.08 IDA financed) supported the Project Steering
            Committee and the three implementation agencies with the implementation of the project.

1.6 Revised Components

1.6.1 The project’s components were not revised, however there were some activities/subprojects
added to respond to the needs of the client. These activities fit within the mandate of the components, and
were critical in achieving the development objective.

1.6.2 To respond to the momentum of the telecommunications reforms and their potential impact on
Samoa’s economy, and to direct the focus on the liberalization and the privatization, the postal component
(Component 4) was reduced to $0.7 million. This reduction also reflected GoS’s concern that SamoaPost
(whose creation as an independent entity was decided in 2007) would be burdened by the size of the loan,
and would not be able to face the reimbursement schedule. Further explanation on reduction of
Component 4 is provided under sections 2.1 and 2.2 below.

1.7 Other significant changes

1.7.1 At the request of the GoS, the project’s original closing date of April 2008 was extended three
times. Additionally, the project also had a reallocation of funds between categories, as well as the
inclusion of types of procurement. Table 4 shows the reallocation of funds for 2007 and 2009.

       The first extension (approved September 2007) of the closing date was for 18 months for a
        closing date of October 2009, to allow for the privatization of SamoaTel, the Output-based Aid
        (OBA) Universal Access Program, and the purchase of SamoaPost fixtures. The Development
        Credit Agreement was amended to include the Consultant Qualifications to allow the

         and to reallocate the proceeds of the credit.
        The second extension (approved October 2009) of 12 months for a closing date of October 31,
         2010; the Development Credit Agreement was amended to further reallocate funds (from Goods
         to Consultant Services) to fund activities requested by the Ministry of Finance (MoF) and
         SamoaPost: (a) a cost assessment of universal postal service, (b) legal advisory services in
         connection with undersea cable infrastructure and services, (c) the purchase of antivirus software;
         (d) support on interconnection rates, (e) alternative dispute resolution, (f) capacity building,
         (g) update of the Telecommunications Policy, (h) the update of the National ICT Policy, and
         (i) update of the Broadcast Policy. The monitoring and evaluation framework was updated to
         reflect the “results framework? that evolved from the KPI model used at the project’s appraisal.

        The third and final extension (approved October 2010) of 4.5 months (to February 2011) was
         requested to allow time to complete the technical assistance contract by the privatization advisors
         for the privatization of SamoaTel. All other activities under the project were closed by October
         2010. Final closing of the privatization of SamoaTel occurred on March 31, 2011.

1.7.2 It is worth mentioning that, at the time of the second extension in September 2009, the Sector
Management Unit and the Country Management Unit acknowledged that pending activities would most
probably not be completed in 12 months. The 12-month extension was approved with the understanding
that a third extension would be granted if key milestones were met by late 2010. This kept pressure on
the Bank and Borrower for rapid implementation, and provided the project with an additional decision-
point in the event that progress in 2010 was not at the level anticipated in 2009.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

2.1.1. The project benefitted from the Bank’s/IDA’s experience (at the time of appraisal) gained from
working in over 50 countries around the world, on similar operations that focused on implementing
liberalization, privatization, and opening monopoly telecommunications sectors to competition. There are
risks in pursuing liberalization in the telecommunications sector in a country with a small population, and
in a remote location, such as Samoa. The end-goal of liberalization is to maximize the impact of market
forces as opposed to state intervention, and this requires critical mass in demand for private operations to
be profitable and to provide incentives for continued innovation. However, lessons learned from the
Caribbean countries and other small economies have indicated that if sequenced and managed properly,
countries with small populations can also introduce and benefit from increased competition in their
telecommunications sectors. In these cases, liberalization needs to be tackled in a holistic manner by
addressing policy and regulatory issues, opening competition, and establishing an independent regulator
to evolve along with the sector. The project was designed to enable Samoa to address the key elements of
liberalization, making it the first among Pacific island countries to take this holistic approach.

2.1.2. At appraisal, the postal component represented about half of the project cost. This was an
unusually high proportion, and can be explained by the fact that a significant part of Component 4: Postal
Reform, namely the development of a corporate strategy and implementation of information systems,
aimed to improve the management and business performance of both the telecommunications and postal
units of SamoaTel. The GoS’s decision to separate the two units was made only two years after project
launch and was not foreseen at the time of the project preparation. Although, in hindsight, the separation
of the business units is thought to have led to the successful privatization of SamoaTel as a
telecommunications provider, the fact that the project could not take into account the necessary steps for
the separation caused delays. Further, once the decision for separation was made, much of the focus and
resources of the project were directed towards preparing for the privatization of SamoaTel. The activities
related directly to the postal sector—and the newly-formed SamoaPost—were delayed significantly and it
was evident that the budget needed for the component had been overstated. The component was reduced
subsequently, and the remaining activities in the component focused on refurbishing and upgrading
SamoaTel’s postal retail outlets, and upgrading operation management capabilities.

2.1.3. Key lessons from other Bank operations in the telecommunications and postal sectors were
considered in the design of the project, and these lessons were:

    (a) Competition is the driver of sector performance. A procompetitive framework and rapid
        transition of a multi-operator environment increases service coverage, quality, and affordability
        of service faster than a state monopoly operator, or a private monopoly. Privatization of the
        incumbent operator is a key step for effective reform;

    (b) Capacity to regulate the sector is necessary to enable fair competition, to address emerging issues
        such as interconnection, pricing of noncompetitive services, spectrum (a scarce resource)
        management, and other disputes that may arise between service providers. There is a steep
        learning curve for the regulatory agency, particularly when the sector opens to competition and to
        new technologies;

    (c) Speed is vital to introducing competition. The design of this project was intended to achieve a
        quick win in the opening of the mobile market, as a cornerstone of sector reform; and




                                                   -7-
    (d) Despite the postal sector’s diminishing relevance to development efforts (a global trend), it still
        benefits from competition and a sound policy framework.


2.2 Implementation

2.2.1 The project suffered from initial delays due to the fact that the implementing agency, the MCIT,
lacked experience in implementing World Bank/IDA projects. There were delays in the submission of
procurement and other project related reports. To build capacity, an external consulting firm experienced
in supporting donor-funded projects was hired as the Project Management Unit (PMU) to support the
Project Steering Committee. Further, the frequency of financial reporting requirements was reduced from
every quarter to every six months. Long delays were caused due to the protracted negotiation processes
between the various stakeholders, particularly once the decisions were made to separate the post and
telecommunications business units, and to privatize SamoaTel.

2.2.2. Prior to the issuance of the second mobile license, the GoS had first to tackle the exclusive rights
granted to Telecommunications Samoa Cellular (TSC) in its10-year license to provide analogue mobile
services. TSC’s license locked Samoa into a low-quality and high-cost service. For example, at the time
of project preparation in 2002, a three-minute call (fixed line) from Samoa to the United States was priced
at $4.20, while a similar call from Australia to the United States cost $0.42. Following an analysis of the
GoS’s options (and likely consequences of each option) to deal with TSC’s exclusive rights, GoS decided
to renegotiate the terms of TSC’s license. TSC agreed to a renegotiation process and, pursuant to a
mutually acceptable Deed of Settlement, TSC agreed to relinquish its exclusive rights in exchange for
being granted a GSM (digital mobile) license. The GoS then proceeded to tender, and to award through
an international, open, and competitive process a second license to introduce competition in the mobile
market. Currently, a three minute call to the United States is priced at $1.20.

2.2.3. The award of the second GSM license was based on coverage obligations and rollout schedules
rather than monetary bids. The emphasis was placed on coverage obligations and not on maximizing
fiscal revenue to enable the new operator to accelerate mobile network expansion across the country. The
GoS was of the view that Samoa had been deprived of new technological developments (including
affordable services) for too long and needed to catch up with its neighbors (i.e., American Samoa,
Australia, New Zealand). Both the coverage obligations as well as the introduction of competition led to
the rapid increase of mobile network coverage, and concomitant introduction of new telecommunications
services throughout Samoa, thereby effectively diminishing the need for a rural telecommunications OBA
scheme.

2.2.4. At the same time it introduced competition in the sector, the GoS created an independent Office
of the Regulator (OoR), following international best practice, to regulate competition in the sector.
Additionally, in 2004, the GoS decided to separate SamoaTel’s telecommunications and postal business
units, a decision that was implemented effectively in 2007. Although not envisaged during project
preparation, splitting SamoaTel into separate postal and telecommunications companies enabled the
successful privatization of SamoTel. The sale of SamoaTel would have been more difficult had
SamoaTel retained the postal business. The postal business, at the time, was perceived to be unprofitable
whereas the telecommunications business was becoming increasingly profitable. However, the complex
process of separation resulted in further delays in implementation.

2.2.5. These two decisions (the creation of the regulator and separation of SamoaTel) are significant in
that both actions required considerable building of institutional capacity. Although there was no need to
revise the components (as the capacity building activities could be migrated to the new entities) the



                                                    -8-
project team intensified its efforts to ensure that both entities were on the right track in terms of
management and operational capacity.

2.2.6. Towards the end of the project, the GoS’s commitment to privatize SamoaTel strengthened, and
upon its request, the project was extended a third time for the purpose of the privatization transaction.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation, and Use

2.3.1 The M&E plan was based on KPIs that were linked to achievements of the various project outputs.
Data for the KPI were sought by the Bank team at regular intervals—usually during supervision
missions—from the OoR, MCIT, SamoaTel, SamoaPost, Digicel, and CSL. However, throughout
implementation collecting data on the indicators was challenging in terms of data availability, delays, and
thoroughness. The challenge stemmed from limited resources (staff time and capacity, and technology)
that hindered the ability to gather such data. In July 2007, as part of the reduction of Component 4:
Postal Reform, the Bank dropped two indicators related to the postal sector (number of letters or items per
inhabitant, and number of inhabitants per full postal service outlet). In 2009 the monitoring and M&E
framework was updated to reflect the “results framework? that evolved from the KPI model used at the
project’s appraisal.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
2.4.1.   This was an Environmental Category B project.
2.4.2. Safeguards compliance is rated satisfactory. During project implementation no issues were
reported regarding compliance with the Bank policy and procedural requirements.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

2.5.1 As a result of the project, Samoa’s telecommunications sector was strengthened with private
investment, a clear regulatory framework, and a functioning regulatory authority. The OoR will continue
its regulatory oversight with the income from annual licences and spectrum fees; and its staff will
participate in and have access to the programs and services provided at the Pacific Regulatory Resource
Centre (in Fiji).

2.5.2 Samoa’s story of reforming its telecommunications sector has had a positive demonstrative effect
throughout the region, and other Pacific Island nations (Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Kiribati,
Marshall Islands, Palau, Solomon Islands, Papua New Guinea, Timor-Leste, and Vanuatu) have followed,
or are in dialogue with the World Bank/IDA for technical assistance in their telecommunications and ICT
sectors:

    (a) Solomon Islands Telecommunications and ICT Development Project (approved 2010);
    (b) Papua New Guinea Rural Communications Project (approved 2010);
    (c) Tonga/Fiji: Phase 1 Pacific Regional Connectivity Project (Adaptable Program Loan [APL],
        approved 2011); Samoa, Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu have also made formal requests for IDA
        support for similar connections;
    (d) The University of the South Pacific in Fiji hosts the Pacific Regulatory Resource Centre (opened
        in fall 2011);
    (e) Federated States of Micronesia, Kiribati, Palau, Republic of the Marshall Islands, and Vanuatu
        are involved in nonlending activities in their telecommunications and ICT sectors;



                                                     -9-
2.5.4. Samoa is, however, now reviewing its options for an undersea cable network to link to other
Pacific Island nations, Australia, New Zealand, Hawaii and the mainland United States. The World Bank
will work with the GoS to explore Samoa’s participation in the APL for the Pacific Islands Connectivity
Project (approved August 2011). A World Bank mission is scheduled to be in Samoa in early November
2011 to discuss Samoa’s options, the APL, and Samoa’s potential participation.

2.5.5. Another outgrowth of this project is the Pacific Regional Infrastructure Facility-funded Pacific
Regulatory Resource Centre (Centre). The centre is currently operational and is expected to provide
training and support to the region’s telecommunications and ICT regulators on a range of technical and
economic issues.

2.5.6. The GoS is considering the option to expand the OoR’s responsibilities beyond
telecommunications and broadcasting to encompass other utilities (electricity, water).

3.1.1. The project has a high relevance of objectives and was in line with the Pacific Island Strategy
2000 as well as the country’s economic development priorities. The project was consistent with the
Pacific Island Strategy 20004 which stated that the development of the postal and telecommunications
sectors is considered crucial to development, and would create an environment where Samoa could
overcome the constraints of being a small-state, including: economic and environmental vulnerability,
changing global trade regimes, and lack of institutional and human capacity. The relevance remains
pertinent at the time of the writing of the ICR. A recent paper Pacific Islands: Directions in IDA 15,
2011 notes that telecommunications and other critical infrastructure expansion have benefitted people
throughout the Pacific.

3.1.2. The PDOs were fully aligned to the GoS’s telecommunications sector strategy that was based on
the premise that the availability of efficient, reliable, and affordable telecommunications services is vital
to promoting rapid economic and social development, as well as facilitate regional integration. The
PDO’s were also aligned to the GoS’s postal sector strategy which aimed to develop the sector by
creating a competitive environment for the existing service providers including those operating without
licenses; to modernize existing postal services through product and pricing reforms; and to improve
management of and access to postal facilities.

3.1.3. The project had a moderately satisfactory design. The components supporting
telecommunications reform were well-designed and the design was based on the success of other similar
projects, with similar PDOs, led by the Bank in 50 other countries. The postal component was not fully
conceptualized in the PAD, and was subsequently reduced during the midterm review. However, the
project components were designed with enough flexibility to allow for changes to adapt to the changing
environment during implementation. This flexibility, and the changes made, enabled the project to
achieve the key development objectives.

  There was no Country Assistance Strategy Samoa at the time of project preparation instead the Bank worked with
a Pacific Island Strategy 2000; the first CAS for Samoa is expected in 2012.

3.1.4. Finally, the project had a moderately satisfactory implementation. The project achieved the key
objectives for the telecommunications sector, despite that this was the first World Bank/IDA project for
MCIT; that the project took on the momentous tasks of issuance of a second mobile license and the
privatization of a state-owned telecommunications provider; and that the project had to develop necessary
policy and regulatory frameworks for liberalization to occur.

3.1.5. Implementation for the telecommunications activities on its own would merit a highly satisfactory
implementation rating. However, the overall rating is moderately satisfactory for two reasons. First, the
activities under the postal component were not fully realized and delayed significantly leading to the
reduction of the component during midterm review. Second, the OBA activity was prepared under the
project, in order to extend services to the rural areas, but was not executed. This was mainly due to the
fact that the obligations set in the second license together with the aggressive competitive dynamics (both
were facilitated by the project) of the sector accelerated the expansion of coverage of telecommunications
services for much of the rural areas of Samoa. Subsequently, despite three extensions of the closing date,
the project was not able to disburse all the resources.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

3.2.1. The first PDO, increasing competition and private sector participation in the
telecommunications and postal sectors, was met successfully for both the telecommunications and postal
sectors, and all but one of the KPI targets were met.

3.2.2. One of the key outcomes for the telecommunications sector was the Samoan people’s increased
access to affordable mobile phone services through the introduction of competition. The target to issue a
second digital cellular license was achieved in April 2006 (Table 2). While the PAD indicated that the
KPI: Total number of customers (fixed and mobile) would likely reach 46,000 by 2008, however, mobile
growth exceeded expectation and this number was surpassed in 2006. The project also surpassed the
revised 2010 target of 115,000 fixed and mobile phone customers (Table 2) which reached 168,000
customers by the end of 2010.

3.2.3. Figure 1 shows that the announcement of the government’s decision to award a second license in
2005 triggered growth in mobile phone subscribers. The threat of competition moved operators to expand
networks and reduce prices preparing themselves for the new competition. The growth in the number of
mobile phone subscribers can be attributed to both expansion of network coverage to previously un-
served areas and to the decline in the price of calls made on a mobile phone.

3.2.4. In particular, two technical assistance outputs under Component 1: Competition and Sector
Reform, facilitated the preparation and award of the license. First, was the technical assistance to support
the revisions to the telecommunications legislation to allow for more competition as well as technical
assistance for accession to the World Trade Organization. The second output provided support to the
MCIT for the drafting of the tender documents and procedures to allow for a competitive and transparent
tender; and support to the evaluation of the bids. The Bank’s support to prepare the policy framework for
competition, as well as the preparation for and support throughout the tender process ensured that the
process was consistent with international good practice, namely, that it was competitive and transparent.
The tender process ended with the disclosure of “Reasons for the Decision? to the public by the GoS,
presenting the ranking of the five bids (Annex 9).

3.2.5. The other key project output for the telecommunications sector was the privatization of SamoaTel
(Table 2) and its sale to BlueSky, a telecommunications company based in American Samoa. The sale
was completed March 2011 for $11 million for 75 percent of the company. Component 3: Corporate
Reform of SamoaTel, supported MOF to carry out the separation of the telecommunications and postal
business units and the privatization of SamoaTel by conducting a restructuring and privatization options
study to assess the options for privatization of SamoaTel, and provide advisors for the valuation of the
company. SamoaTel was heavily debt ridden with loans from the GoS. The project provided support for
the valuation of assets and liabilities of the two enterprises and preparation of audited accounts (following
international standards) with debt restructuring (needing Cabinet approval).

3.2.6    The target for the KPI on Increase in the number of Internet subscribers was met in 2010 when
the number of subscribers increased to about 12,000 (Table 2). The technical assistance provided for the
policy and regulatory framework as well as for the issuance of the second mobile license also had a
positive impact on the accessibility and affordability of Internet service as it is being carried over mobile
networks. Further, the operator that was awarded the second digital license has a partnership with an
Internet service provider.

3.2.7. Despite room for improvement in the design of the postal component, the PDO was met.
Competition was reinforced namely through the establishment of SamoaPost as a commercially-viable



                                                    - 12 -
operation. The key issue with the new entity, SamoaPost, was to build internal capacity to manage the
postal operations, and for it to be financially viable once it separated from the telecommunications unit.
The Bank’s technical assistance involved developing and implementing a corporate strategy for the new
SamoaPost, building management capacity through defining a cost recovery structure, and readjusting the
tariff structure to a more cost-based approach. As a result of the project, SamoaPost is self-sustaining and
saw revenues increase from about WST 1 million in 2003 to WST 2.5 million in 2010.5 Although
SamoaPost is the only postal entity that provides a full-range of postal services (including access to the
Internet), it competes in a market with the informal postal channels provided by the networks such as
church communities and universities.

3.7.8 Although the project achieved the overall PDO, it did not meet one out of the three KPI targets
related to the postal sector. As shown in Table 2, the 2010 target for the KPI on Increase number of post
office mail boxes per 100 inhabitants, was three mail boxes per 100 people. The actual number came
slightly short at 2.8 mailboxes per 100 people. The 2010 target for the KPI on Increase number of letter
item/inhabitant, was three letters/items per person, which was met. The Postal Bill and Postal Policy
were endorsed by the Parliament in 2010. The first two targets were revised in 2009 to reflect the
growing global trend in the decline of the use of postal networks.

3.2.9. The second PDO, strengthening the institutional and regulatory capacities for the
telecommunications and postal sectors, was largely achieved through the establishment of the OoR.
Establishing an independent regulatory authority is a major undertaking, particularly as capacity building
takes time and high turn-over of personnel makes it difficult to retain knowledge, experience, and
institutional memory. It is an institution that is costly to operate, and requires a team with both legal and
technical expertise. Currently, larger markets in the Pacific (such as Fiji and Tonga) are without
independent regulators. The administration costs to fund a regulator for a small country such as Samoa is
high and therefore, to leverage economies of scale, the plan is for the OoR to eventually become a multi-
sector regulator. Funding for the OoR comes from annual license and spectrum fees. The MCIT which
retains the policy function for the telecommunications, postal and broadcasting sectors were supported
through the project in the development of policy and legal documents. The two targets to put in place an
interconnection regime and new spectrum monitoring system were achieved in October 2010 (Table 2).

3.2.10. The third PDO, enhancing the provision of these (telecommunications and postal) services in
selected areas, was met successfully namely through the coverage obligations tied to the second mobile
license as well as the introduction of competition into the market. The 2010 target for the KPI on
Increase number of telecommunication customers in rural areas, was 7,000, as shown in Table 2. The
actual number reported of customers in rural areas at the end of 2010 was 57,943. The unrealistic jump
reflects an underestimation of the expected targets; and weakness in gathering data. A universal fund was
created and preparation for the OBA pilot was conducted under the project in order to cover additional
areas. However, at the tail-end of the project focus was directed to the privatization of SamoaTel.
Implementation of the $100,000 OBA pilot would have required an additional extension, as
disbursements under OBA tenders would have had to be made upon service delivery. On the postal side,
the number of district post offices remain at four (with four more to open in Savaii in 2011), but the
number of subpost offices went from 30 in 2002 (25 in Upolu, 5 in Savaii) to 41 in 2010 (37 in Upolo, 4
in Savaii).

3.3 Efficiency

3.3.1. Despite all the challenges listed above, the project achieved its objectives and created economic
benefits that far exceed the cost of the project. Annex 3 analyzes the economic benefits created by: (a)
the liberalization of the mobile sector and introduction of a second operator; and (b) the privatization of
SamoaTel.

Liberalization of the Mobile Sector

3.3.2. The increase in consumer welfare created by the introduction of the second mobile operator has
been calculated. For this exercise, consumer welfare was assessed using an estimation of price elasticity
done over a sample of 143 countries, and information on subscribers for Samoa. The period covered is
between 2005 (just before the second mobile license was issued) and 2009 (latest information on price
and subscribers). Additionally, a more conservative scenario was calculated using previous calculations
on elasticity done in 2008. Table 5 shows the results:


       Table 5. Consumer Welfare Created by the Introduction of a Second Mobile Operator
                                                      Conservative               Optimistic
            Price elasticity                               0.28                    0.1109
            Subscribers in 2005                           24,000                   24,000
            Subscribers in 2009                          151,000                  151,000
            Price/month 2009 ($)                           8.75                     8.75
            Increase in welfare (2005-2009)           $20.03 million           $50.56 million


3.3.3. The analysis suggests that the introduction of the second mobile operator created between $20
million and $51 million in consumer welfare.

Privatization of SamoaTel

3.3.4. The third extension of the project was requested (and approved) so that Bank assistance would
continue to the GoS during the privatization of SamoaTel. As explained earlier, privatization was
contemplated in the design of the project, but the GoS and the Bank agreed to proceed with the
transaction towards the end of the project.

3.3.5. In order to evaluate the privatization, a valuation of the company was done. The main
assumptions and calculations are included in Annex 3. Conservative and optimistic scenarios were
created, assuming different revenue growth rates, EBITDA margins, and CapEx ratios for SamoaTel.

3.3.6. Using these assumptions, the value of the company has been estimated to be between $5.9 million
and $17.1 million. Using the average of these two values, $11.5 million and knowing that 75 percent of
the company was sold for $11 million (an implied $14.6 million company valuation), the operation has
produced approximately $2.4 million in profits to the GoS.

3.3.7. In conclusion, it could be said that the benefits the project created through the liberalization of the
mobile sector and the privatization of SamoaTel are between $14 million and $53 million.

Other Benefits

3.3.8. It is important to mention that the project has created other benefits that have not been quantified
in this exercise. Among others, the most important are:

    (a) Impact on postal sector. Private participation in the postal sector was formalized, and SamoaPost
        has posted profits since the separation from SamoaTel, thanks in part to the strategic planning
        study carried out by the project.
    (b) Impact of conflict resolution in mobile. Stakeholders have confirmed that without the Bank’s
        intervention in the negotiations with TSC, Samoa, most probably, would have remained in a
        monopolistic market for mobile. The benefits of this effect are included in the analysis of the
        liberalization presented above.
    (c) Regional reform agenda. This project not only represented the first of its kind in the Pacific
        region, but triggered other requests from countries in the region that want to replicate the success
        of the Samoan experience to transition towards a competitive telecommunications market.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

3.4.1. The rating is based on relevance, PDO achievement and efficiency, and reflects the GoS’s success
in reforming the sector (through liberalizing the sector, and privatizing SamoaTel) and increasing
telecommunications penetration from 7 percent to 95 percent, its endorsement the Postal and
Broadcasting Bills, and SamoaPost’s profitable split from SamoaTel, and the privatization of SamoaTel.

3.4.2.    The project has met its main development objectives.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

3.5.1 The Samoan population, academia, and the public and private sectors are expected to benefit from
the reforms through:

    (a) The reduced price of communications services enabled by competition;
    (b) The extended access to communications services due to reduced prices brought by the upgrade to
        digital cellular technology, and the coverage obligations included in the license for a digital
        cellular operator;
    (c) Samoa’s geographic remoteness will be reduced by the cellular roaming and Samoa will enjoy
        higher regional integration given the reduced costs for international communications. The
        capacity building activities supported by this project will facilitate the participation of Samoan
        officials in regional professional development activities. Increased competitiveness of enterprises.
        The reduced price of communications services, extension of digital cellular services and


                                                    - 15 -
        international roaming are benefits that the project will have on the competitiveness of Samoan
        enterprises. Expanded rural access is expected to facilitate the development of economic
        activities outside Apia; and
    (d) Effective delivery of traditional and new postal services (billing service for utilities, payment
        service for utility customers, courier services, cyber café, leasing space in Post Office to Western
        Union for money transfer, etc.).

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

3.5.2. The OoR was created to regulate the telecommunications sector. The OoR is funded by revenues
from the telecommunications sector which MoF collects, and MoF provides the OoR with a budget. The
institutional success of the OoR (design and implementation) is also witnessed by the fact that the GoS is
considering appointing the OoR to become the regulator for other infrastructure sectors in Samoa.

3.5.3. All implementing agencies, MoF, MCIT, SamoaTel/SamoaPost, as well as the OoR received
training for capacity building from the project. MCIT received technical assistance to draft its
Telecommunications, Postal Bills, and Broadcast Bills, and with the deployment of the spectrum
management system. The OoR was strengthened by technical assistance in the areas of interconnection,
dispute resolution; and the MoF was supported for the privatization of SamoaTel (options study and
privatization advisors), and SamoaTel and SamoaPost were split into separate entities (an important
action that enhanced SamoaTel’s profile to prospective buyers) and the privatization of SamoaTel was
supported by the project through its technical assistance for the transaction advisors.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

3.5.4. Despite the final extension intended for the implementation of the MCIT-managed Pilot for
Output-based Aid for Rural Communications ($100,000), was held in bottleneck and work was not started.
However, the market forces set in motion by the liberalized and competitive market, facilitated mobile
penetration throughout Samoa—including rural areas— and has reached 95 percent for all of Samoa.

3.5.5. Cabinet approval of the Postal and Broadcast Bills (technical assistance for this was funded by
the credit). The National ICT Strategy is drafted and is awaiting approval by the Cabinet.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

3.6.1   Surveys were not generated and stakeholder workshops were not conducted.


4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Low

4.1.     Reversal of liberalization of the sector, as well as renationalization of SamoaTel is remote. The
GoS is committed to liberalization of other sectors including the privatization of other state-owned
entities. The benefits of liberalization, including increase in affordability and accessibility of
telecommunications and postal services are evident to both the GoS and to the citizens of Samoa.

4.2.    The second mobile license was awarded to Digicel Ltd. in 2006. The thriving competition
triggered by the introduction of competition has increased accessibility and affordability of
telecommunications services to both urban and rural areas of Samoa. Further, additional services are



                                                   - 16 -
being provided over the mobile phone platform. Within weeks of the Bluesky’s acquisition of SamoaTel,
Digicel began its mobile banking services with its “Mobile Me? for overseas transfers.

4.3.     The OoR today regulates the telecommunications, postal, and broadcasting sectors, and
discussions are underway with GoS to extend its responsibilities to the electricity and water sectors. The
regulator will have access to the Pacific Regulatory Resource Centre (in Fiji) for further capacity building
in the telecommunications and ICT sector. The OoR’s budget is now completely sustained through
revenue generated from the sector; these revenues are collected by the MoF and the MoF provides the
OoR with an annual budget. Litigation of disputes continues, and such litigation initially placed a
tremendous burden on the resources of the OoR, but fewer decisions are being disputed in the courts
largely due to the technical assistance to develop a mechanism for alternative disputes resolution with a
focus on mediation, and to a nonrefundable fee to subsidize the court costs that is required (by the
Attorney General’s office) by the operator bringing forth the dispute.

4.4.    SamoaTel’s privatization was completed in March 31, 2011. The GoS received $11 million for
75 percent of the shares of SamoaTel. The remaining 25 percent of the shares were transferred to the Unit
Trust of Samoa. Bluesky SamoaTel is making progress in providing improved services to customers, and
maintaining its investment in its new incarnation as a privately owned company.


5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.1.1 The Bank/IDA team worked closely with the GoS and stakeholders to design a project that would
address and strengthen weaknesses in Samoa’s telecommunications and postal sectors. The components
supporting telecommunications reform were designed based on the success of other similar projects, with
similar PDOs, led by the Bank in 50 other countries. However, the technical assistance needed for the
postal component was over-estimated at appraisal, and during the midterm review, funds from it were
relocated to the components supporting telecommunications reforms. The project was designed to allow
for changes to adapt to the changing environment during implementation. This flexibility, and the
changes made, enabled the project to achieve the key development objectives.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

5.1.2. Focus on development impact. The team’s focus on development impact was constant, and used
sector-proven approaches towards corporatization, liberalization, privatization, and the creation of an
enabling environment that was based on experience of supporting sector reforms in more than 50
countries.

5.1.3. Adequacy of supervision inputs and processes. The task team remained flexible and responsive
to the GoS and the implementing agencies to manage key tasks so that they could be completed within the
project, and to add additional support to enhance the capacity of the MCIT (for instance, the development
of a regime for alternative dispute resolution, with a focus on mediation; support to resolve
interconnection issues, etc.). The credit’s proceeds were reallocated twice, two additional procurement
methods were added, and there were three extensions of the closing date, all to ensure that the
development objectives of the project were met.



                                                   - 17 -
5.1.4. The team was proactive and maintained frequent communications with the clients, making every
effort to respond quickly and to follow-up with pending matters. The management of the implementation
(in general with all aspects of the project, but particularly with procurement matters, and issues related to
the privatization transaction). Monthly audio conferences (and more frequent during crush periods, such
as the closing date for all activities but those related to the privatization) were conducted to review and
provide guidance where it was needed to move meet the deadlines of the scheduled actions.

5.1.5. The team was effective in managing the extensions of the closing date (three), reallocation of
proceeds of the credit (two). Working with the government to design clear and implementable action
plans for the duration of the project.

5.1.6. Candor and quality of performance reporting. The team was candid in its reporting of
performance issues, both to World Bank/IDA management and to the clients. Key issues were reported
consistently. The quality of performance reporting was strong, with supervision documents being written
clearly and shared with all implementing agencies and other officials relevant to the process (for instance,
the Attorney General’s Office).

5.1.7. Supervision of fiduciary and safeguard aspects. Supervision of fiduciary aspects was thorough
and proactive, and there were no major issues throughout the project.

5.2.1. The GoS was unwaveringly committed to implementing the sector reforms needed to address the
constraints to development of Samoa’s postal and telecommunications sectors. The team leveraged this
support to make progress on the activities financed by the project. This commitment was particularly
strong with creating the OoR, opening competition in the telecommunications market with the offering of
the second GSM license, splitting the postal and telecommunication business of SamoaTel, and lastly,
with the privatization of SamoaTel.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

5.2.2. The implementing agencies: MoF, MCIT, and SamoaTel (and later SamoaPost) were committed
to achieving the development objective of increasing access to affordable services.

5.2.3. Early in project implementation the areas of financial management identified for strengthening
were: information systems, budget systems and financial reporting. These areas were hampered by the
existing MTX software, and in response to the need to provide accurate and timely reporting, the PMU
adopted the use of an Excel-based system. The PMU provided quarterly project management reports
containing updates on disbursement, procurement, and financial management.

5.2.4. The overall pace of implementation reflected the limited institutional capacity in Samoa (with its
shortage of skilled staff, and high-turnover of staff, both are widespread features in Pacific regional
governments), the borrower and the implementing agencies performed relatively satisfactory.




                                                   - 18 -
5.2.5. Leading to the preparation for the privatization of SamoaTel, the transaction advisors identified
financial management-related tasks that were vital to the privatization transaction: the transfer and
valuation of assets between GoS and SamoaTel, write-off of debt, and the audit of financial statement of
SamoaTel. The valuation of SamoaTel and the audited financial statements of SamoaTel experienced a
three-month delay, which led the government to request a third extension of the closing date to February
28, 2011, so that the privatization transaction (among others) could be funded by the proceeds of the
credit.

5.2.6. Disbursements: Of the original Credit of SDR 3.4 million, SDR .744 was undisbursed and
cancelled at project closing. Total disbursement at project closing was SDR 2.655. The cancellation of
funds did not compromise the project’s ability to achieve its objectives. Other than the slow rate of
disbursement and the undisbursed/cancelled amount, there were no further issues.

Rating: Satisfactory


6. Lessons Learned

6.1.    Liberalization of the telecommunications and postal sector is possible in a small country such as
Samoa when it is approached in a comprehensive manner (encompassing liberalization, regulatory
framework, and private sector participation/privatization of SamoaTel). The reforms radically changed
the landscape for ICTs in Samoa. The project provided capacity building to the MoF, MCIT, and the
OoR. More capacity building in MCIT and the OoR may have enabled their ability to increase the depth
and width of the reform agendas. MCIT, and OoR were slow to act on the agenda for rural access, and
ICT reforms (that usually follow telecommunications reforms) were not undertaken.

6.2.     Opening the telecommunications sector to competition and new technologies presents
governments with a new set of learning curves. SamoaTel’s market position was critically affected by the
entry of a competitor (Digicel) in the sector. Digicel soon became the dominant provider in Samoa, and
despite its position in the market, it liberally and systematically litigated disputes that paralyzed the
business of its competitor, and mobilized the OoR's limited resources. Rather than focus on regulatory
matters that would benefit the market – interconnection, quality of service, pricing policy, broadband
strategy, etc. – the OoR instead was tending to matters under litigation. In a small market where the
incumbent has long been protected by its status, a comprehensive reform should commit more resources
to prepare stakeholders for new market rules, and assess realistically the speed at which new competition
can overtake and dominate the marketplace.

6.3.     Lack of leadership in drawing the appropriate policy framework in a timely manner is a key
factor in delays for sector reform. The MoF took the lead on a few items related to the reform agenda
items (particularly, SamoaTel’s restructuring and privatization), but the rest of the sector reform agenda
lacked momentum; and this inertia slowed project implementation. In addition, there was limited
capacity to implement the reforms, and this translated into delayed progress, and into extending the
project three times (for a total of 34 months beyond the original closing date). In the future, project
designs should assess the strength of leadership, and provide for effective capacity for adequate project
implementation.

6.4.     In a small island economy, postal services have limited space for growth, and need more support
to build a diversity of business streams (such as money transfers and payments) and improved quality of
service to regain market shares in the parcels and express segments.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component


1. Competition and Sector Reform to assist Ministry of Communications Information Technology
   MCIT to implement GoS policy to introduce competition in Samoa's posts and telecommunications
   sectors.
  Policy and legal reform (including World Trade Organization accession) for the Telecommunications
  and Postal Sectors (1.1). The technical assistance provided support to identify reforms necessary for
  Samoa’s telecommunications sector to transition from a monopoly to a more competitive market with
  incentives for operators to reduce prices and innovate. The technical assistance supported the
  revisions to the telecommunications and postal legislation to allow for more competition as well as
  start the process of accession to the World Trade Organization.

  Advisors to MCIT for the award of a digital cellular license (1.2) to a private operator through an
  open, competitive international tender. The technical assistance provided support to the MCIT with
  the drafting of the tender documents and procedures to allow for a competitive and transparent tender;
  and support to the evaluation of the bids. The license was awarded in March 2006 to Digicel Samoa
  Ltd. The Bank’s support in preparing the policy framework for competition as well as the preparation
  for and support throughout the tender process ensured that the process was consistent with
  international good practice, namely that it was competitive and transparent (Annex 9).

2. Regulatory Reform to assist MCIT to introduce effective regulation of the telecommunications sector
   and to strengthen the regulatory capacity of MCIT.
   Provision of Advice to MCIT on Regulatory Matters (2.1) undertaken to address key issues such as
   interconnection between operators, management of spectrum which is a scarce resource, and drafting
   license templates. The Corporate Plan was developed jointly by the OoR staff and consultants
   provided technical assistance. The project also included the preparation of key policies:
   Telecommunications Policy, Postal Bill, and its update (2010), Broadcasting Bill (2010), and
   National ICT Policy (pending); these provide the framework to facilitate the separation of the policy
   arm (MCIT) and regulatory arm (OoR) which is in line with international good practice.

  Information systems (2.2) were supplied/installed/ and a maintenance program provided to MCIT for
  its business operation (PCs, docking stations, monitors, notebooks, servers, UPS for servers, back-up
  drives software and media, printers, projector and accessories, copier, fax/scanner machine,
  conference telephone, RAM drive, PC operating system, Microsoft Office software, Adobe PDF,
  project management software).

  An integrated spectrum management system (2.4) was procured to allow MCIT to monitor/manage
  Samoa’s spectrum with modern tools.

  Monitoring and evaluation of poverty impact (2.5) was conducted to explore options to increase
  access to communications services beyond the level sustained by commercial operators in the rural
  areas. The options submitted included a pilot project for an output based aid scheme that would allow
  operators to bid for the minimum subsidy in a public tender process to reach unserved areas of the
  country. The activities supporting the roll-out of services into the unserved areas was initiated late
  2010 when it was handed over from MCIT to the OoR. This left very little time for roll-out and
  Samoa was unable to access and make full use of $100,000 that was available for the pilot OBA
  scheme (2.8), and the pilot was not conducted. Further, the original intention to extend postal
  services was not achieved.



                                                - 22 -
     Interconnection Cost Study(2.12) was conducted to assist GoS to establish fully cost based
     interconnection rates for mobile- and fixed-lines services, in keeping with international best
     practices. The rates were to be fair and nondiscriminatory and to include a fare rate-of-return on
     investment to the fixed and mobile operators. (2.16) Strengthening the Institutional Capacity of the
     Regulators was undertaken to conduct an independent assessment of the OoR via multiple
     methodologies and analysis to illustrate a comprehensive “roadmap? based on existing operations
     and functions of the OoR and the key regulatory challenges. The consultants assisted in the
     development and review of the overall strategic approach proposed by the OoR for the next five
     years. (2.17) Alternative Dispute Resolution, or ADR, with a focus on Mediation was undertaken to
     is to assist the OoR to develop an appropriate alternative to litigation as the traditional form
     of dispute resolution. Conscious of the range of ADR methods available, the OoR specified
     its preference for a regime that focuses on mediation. In order to ensure efficiency and the
     proper utilization of resources, the OoR intends to develop this regime in collaboration with
     the Ministry of Justice and Court Administration, the administrator of the Alternative
     Dispute Resolution Act 2007 (ADR Act).

 4. Corporate Reform of SamoaTel to develop and assess options to enhance the corporate performance
     of SamoaTel for privatization. SamoaTel Scoping Study (3.1) was undertaken to advise and assist
     the GoS to identify the options for the reform of SamoaTel by reviewing the current business
     environment and sales issues for SamoaTel, and provided a broad framework within which further
     specific due diligence and sale management tasks were to be undertaken. The Privatization Advisors
     (3.2) provided technical assistance to the GoS to perform a valuation of SamoaTel, to prepare the
     privatization transaction, or sale of SamoaTel. The privatization transaction was delayed (due to
     limited capacity at MoF and to health reasons of a key member of the consulting firm), and a third
     extension to the closing date was approved to allow the privatization to proceed under the project.
     SamoaTel was privatized on March 31, 2011.
5. Postal Reform including technical assistance to construct a postal sector strategy
    The technical assistance provided to the postal branch of SamoaTel were, overall, high-quality,
    although, one could argue, that the SamoaTel postal staff did not fully embrace and reap the full
    benefit of the high-level advise, in part because of the high turn-over of staff.

    The technical assistance on (4.1.1) Corporate Strategy and Implementation for the Postal Services
    was undertaken by Transend, Zealand. Transend had earlier provided support to the postal services of
    SamoaTel, so it was well versed in its market structure and its dynamics. Transend conducted a
    detailed market analysis and SWOT analysis of the SamoaTel's postal services to structure a strategic
    recommendations and action plan. Transend insisted on the need to strengthen the commercial and
    marketing capacity of the branch to discover the demand and the client's needs; it also provided
    advice on adjusting the tariffs to set them at a cost-recovery level. The study prepared a pro forma
    profit-and-loss statement for the postal branch for the years 2004 and 2005, which showed that the
    postal service was run at a profit, a conclusion that surprised most stakeholders, but which has since
    proved to be factual.

    The technical assistance on the (4.1.2) Legal Dimensions of the Postal Business provided valuable
    advice in the field of partnership/service level agreement contracting, as well as on the more
    institutional front, ideas to spur increased compensated for the universal service obligations. This
    assistance aimed to strengthen the ability of the postal service to negotiate access of the postal retail
    access points by partners, and seek an optimal outsourcing policy with a view to focus on its core
    business. The outcome of this assistance was, unfortunately, only partially implemented by the post.


                                                    - 23 -
  The technical assistance relative to the (4.1.3) Audit, awarded to Comgate, mainly aimed to prepare
  the separation between the telecommunications and postal branches of SamoaTel, and to provide a
  cost methodology for SamaoTel so it could replicate the cost accounting system over the years until
  actual separation between the two branches. The study covered both the balance sheet of SamoaTel,
  providing a pro forma split between assets/liabilities, and the income statement, with the separation
  between telecommunications and postal revenues, and telecommunications and postal expenses. It
  provided SamoaTel with a detailed methodology for asset valuation, cost accounting, and pricing
  policy.

  Equipment and furniture purchased by SamaoTel for the postal business mainly aimed to improve its
  retail services (IT equipment and mail electronic scales) and its commercial orientation and image
  (particularly, the set- up of a modern cyber cafe, and new furniture/display cases for the refurbished
  headquarters). This equipment contributed a tangible and improved image of the soon-to-be
  SamoaPost.

5. Project Management. Technical assistance to support the Project Steering Committee and
   implementing agencies to implement the project. The PMU provided support to the implementing
   agencies and the Project Steering Committee in the areas of procurement, financial reporting,
   implementation reporting, and record keeping.

  The project financed professional development (training, study visits) to build the capacity of staff in
  all of the implementing agencies: MCIT, OoR, SamoaTel, and SamoaPost.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

1.       This section provides an estimation of the economic and financial analysis of two outcomes of the
project, namely: (a) the liberalization of the mobile sector and introduction of a second operator; and
(b) the privatization of SamoaTel.

Liberalization of the Mobile Sector

2. Liberalization and introduction of competition brought prices down and increased penetration of
mobile services in the country. The economic benefits created by this reform can be measured by the
increase in consumer welfare. A conservative calculation of consumer welfare is given by the following
equation:

                                 ?W = [ 1 / 2 ]*[ Q1 + Q2 ] * [ P1 - P2 ]

where:
   ?W is the increase in consumer welfare
   Pi is the price in period i
   Qi is the quantity in period i

Since information on a weighted average price is only available for the years 2008 and 2009, the increase
in welfare has been calculated using price elasticity. Price elasticity is given by:

                                          ?P = [ ?Q /?P ] * [ P / Q ]

where:
   ?P is the price elasticity of demand
   ?Q is the change in quantity
   ?P is the change in price

3. Then, the increase in welfare can be expressed as:


                               ?W = [ 1 / 2 ] * [ (?Q)2 / ?P ] * [ P / Q ]

4.     To calculate the price elasticity, the demand for mobile services was estimated using information
from 143 developing countries for the year 2008. The results of the demand calculation are provided in
Table A3.1:


                             Table A3.1. Demand for Mobile Services
              Dependent variable: L(Q/T)

                                                     - 25 -
                 R-Squared             65.68%
                 Adj. R-Squared        65.19%
                 F-statistic           133.973
                 Probability (F)       0.00000

5.      The dependent variable was penetration of mobile subscribers (Q/T), and the independent
variables were monthly price (L(P)) and GDP per capita (L(Y)). The underlying demand function is a
loglinear one, so Logarithms were used to estimate elasticities. As shown in the table, price elasticity is
estimated to be 0.1109.

6.      Knowing that the weighted average price of mobile services in Samoa was $8.756 and that users
increased from 24,000 in 2005 to 151,000 by year-end 2009, consumer welfare increased by $50 million.
A similar exercise was done by Favaro, Halewood, and Rossotto in 20087 to evaluate the value of reform
in 2006. Price elasticity was estimated in -0.28. Using this estimation, consumer welfare would have
increased by $20 million. Table A3.2 shows these two estimations:


       Table A3.2. Consumer Welfare Created by the Introduction of a Second Mobile Operator
                                                Conservative           Optimistic
             Price elasticity                       0.28                  0.1109
             Subscribers in 2005                   24,000                 24,000
             Subscribers in 2009                  151,000                151,000
             Price/month 2009 ($)                   8.75                   8.75
             Increase in welfare (2005-2009)   $20.03 million         $50.56 million


7.       The changes between the two estimations suggest that as mobile markets expand and worldwide
users increase, the mobile service becomes more inelastic. That is, people are less sensitive to change in
prices in terms of their use of the mobile service. Thus, the analysis suggests that the introduction of the
second mobile operator created between $20 million and $50 million in consumer welfare.

Privatization of SamoaTel

8.      The privatization of SamoaTel, despite being included as part of the project since its design, was
only done towards the end of the project, in 2010. Moreover, the third extension of the project was
requested so that the Bank could assist the GoS during the process.

9.      In order to estimate the benefits created by the privatization, a valuation of the company was
carried out. Tables A3.3 and A3.4 show Balance Sheet and P&L information for 2008-2010, while Table
A3.5 includes the main assumptions for the valuation:

        (a) According to Wireless Intelligence, revenue growth for mobile operators was 25 percent in
            2010. Even though a portion of revenues from SamoaTel comes from fixed line services
            (which in turn has a lower growth rate), this growth rate was used for the optimistic scenario.
        (b) SamoaTel had an EBITDA margin of 20 percent in 2010. However, industry estimates are
            between 40 percent and 50 percent. The optimistic scenario assumes efficiency gains for the
            next ten years that will increase EBITDA margins to 50 percent.
        (c) Depreciation has been assumed to be equal to the amount included in 2010.
        (d) New investments in SamoaTel will focus on their mobile business. Mobile operators invest
            approximately 30 percent of their revenues.
        (e) SamoaTel did not have any debt by the time it was privatized. For the calculation of the cost
            of capital, a debt ratio similar to the one in the United States telecommunications services
            industry has been assumed as optimal.
        (f) Debt rate is given by the average commercial debt in Samoa as reported by the Samoan
            Central Bank in June 2011.

10.      Table A3.6 shows the estimated Cash Flows. The net present value of the cash flow is $17
million in the optimistic scenario and $6 million in the conservative scenario. The average is $11.5
million, below the implied valuation of $14.6 million given by the $11 million paid for 75 percent of the
company.

11.     From this analysis, it could be said that the benefits the project created through the liberalization
of the mobile sector and the privatization of SamoaTel are between $23 and $45 million.

Other Benefits

12.      It is important to mention that the project has created other benefits that have not been quantified
in this exercise. Among others, the most important are:

    (a) Impact on postal sector. Private participation in the postal sector was formalized, and
        SamoaPost has posted profits since the separation from SamoaTel, thanks in part to the
        strategic planning study carried out by the project.
    (b) Impact of conflict resolution in mobile. Stakeholders have confirmed that without the
        Bank’s intervention in the negotiations with TSC. Samoa, most probably, would have
        remained in a monopolistic market for mobile. The benefits of this effect are included in
        the analysis of the liberalization presented above.
    (c) Regional reform agenda. This project not only represented the first of its kind in the
        Pacific region, but triggered other requests from countries in the region that want to
        replicate the success of the Samoan experience to transition towards a competitive
        telecommunications market.

News Release




                                 Government of Samoa

              Ministry of Communications and Information Technology

Apia, Samoa, 8 March, 2006 – Today, the Minister of Communications and Information
Technology, the Honourable Palusalue Faapo II, announced a decision to award a new GSM
digital cellular telecommunications licence in Samoa. The decision concludes a competitive
licensing process that was launched on 4 October, 2005. Five applications for the licence were
received on 10th February, 2006.

The Minister announced that the licence will be awarded to a new company to be jointly owned
by Computer Services Ltd. (CSL), Samoa’s largest internet service provider and a wireless
network operator, and Digicel Ltd. which operates GSM networks in 15 Caribbean island nations.
The new company will be called Digicel Samoa Ltd.

In making the announcement, the Minister said: “The Government of Samoa is very pleased to
have received five good applications to provide GSM services. We have selected the applicant
that best met the criteria established in our competitive process. Digicel Samoa Ltd demonstrated
that it has the most experience and the strong financial capability to quickly build and operate a
world-class new GSM network to serve all areas of Samoa.?

Digicel Samoa Ltd’s application proposes to build a state-of –the art GSM cellular network, with
over 40 cell sites throughout Samoa. The company will hire 27 permanent employees, and
create up to 200 indirect jobs in construction, sales and distribution channels. The new network
will be operational within six months.

The Minister added that: “The licensing of a new GSM cellular service is the next step in our
program to modernize the telecommunications sector in Samoa. Last year we passed the
Telecommunications Act 2005, and established a modern telecommunications regulatory
framework. We have now successfully completed an open competition to licence an experienced
new telecommunications operator for Samoa. As a result of our telecommunications

modernization program, the people of Samoa will see more competition, lower prices and a wide
range of new services.?


The Government of Samoa was advised throughout the licensing process by McCarthy Tétrault,
a large Canadian law firm with a leading international telecommunications practice. They have
advised on similar licensing processes in over a dozen countries.

Minister Palusalue Faapo II added: “We are pleased with the recent progress made by both
existing telecommunications operators, Samoa Tel and Telecom Samoa Cellular Ltd. to expand
coverage in Samoa. Introduction of the new GSM network operator will provide a stimulus to
ensure that there is healthy competition among all Samoan telecommunications service providers.
The result will be that Samoans will receive among the best telecommunications services at the
best prices in the South Pacific.?

                                       Reasons for Decision

This document sets out the reasons for the decision made today, to select a one of the five
applicants to receive a new GSM digital cellular telecommunications licence in Samoa, and to
deny the applications of the other four applicants.

This decision concludes a competitive licensing process that was launched by issuance of an
Information Memorandum (InfoMem) on 4 October, 2005. Five applications for the licence were
received on 10th February, 2006. These applications were filed on behalf of:

   ATH - Amalgamated Telecom Holdings, owner of Fiji Telecom and Vodafone Fiji,
   BSC - Blue Sky Communications, a mobile operator based in American Samoa,
   CSLD – Dicigel Samoa Ltd, a company owned by CSL, a Samoa-based Internet service
    provider and Digicel, a mobile operator in the Caribbean,
   PSW - Pro-Com-Samoa Wireless, a Samoan wireless and technical services company,
   SDC - Samoa Digital Cellular, a Samoan wireless and technical services company.

The applications were evaluated in accordance with 5 evaluation criteria that were described in
detail in the InfoMem. The maximum points available for each criterion were as follows:

                                                                  M aximum
              Evaluation Criteria                                 Points
        (a)   Demonstrated telecommunications sector experience       35
        (b)   Demonstrated financial capability                       35
        (c)   Viable business plan                                    10
        (d)   Service commitments                                     10
        (e)   Proposed local benefits                                 10

An assessment of the 5 applications against the evaluation criteria produced the following main
results:

Three bids did not meet the minimum requirements set out in the 5 evaluation criteria:

      PSW and SDC have no experience in operating GSM cellular mobile systems, and no
       partners with 10,000 or more mobile subscribers (as required by the InfoMem). While
       PSW and SDC have some private mobile wireless experience, neither have GSM mobile
       experience, nor partners with any. PSW and SDC therefore failed to obtain the minimum
       points required under criterion (a).

      ATH did not clearly demonstrate its commitment to fund its business plan nor to
       investment in Samoa and it provided an incomplete business plan. ATH thus failed to
       obtain the minimum points required by the InfoMem under criteria (b) and (c). ATH’s
       application provided few details of the services it would provide in Samoa; nor was
       detailed information provided on local benefits. There was no analysis of the Samoan
       market nor proposed services, pricing plans, distribution channels, etc. ATH thus also
       failed to obtain the minimum points required under criteria (d) and (e).

For these reasons, the bids from ATH, PSW and SDC were ranked well below those of BSC and
CSLD.

Comparing the two leading applicants – BSC and CSLD:

      With respect to the criterion of telecom sector experience, Digicel (the majority
       shareholder of CSLD) is a bigger and more experienced operator than Blue Sky (BSC)
       with 1.7 million subs in 15 Caribbean island markets, compared to 16.5 thousand in one
       market for Blue Sky. In addition, CSL operates Samoa’s largest internet and private
       wireless communications networks. Thus CSLD has more mobile GSM and, generally,
       more wireless telecommunications sector experience, and was awarded significantly
       more points for criterion (a).

      Digicel is a much larger operator than Blue Sky and it has much larger and more credible
       financial capability. CSLD’s ST$81.6 million in investment, with 50 percent in equity is
       fully funded at the outset of the business plan. Blue Sky committed less than ST$1
       million in investment and proposed to finance more than 90 percent of its project with
       debt. Digicel is a large and profitable operator, while the information submitted by e-
       Landia, the recently restructured parent company of BSC indicated that it has
       significantly less financial capability than Digicel and CSL. CSLD thus obtains more
       points under criterion (b).

      BSC’s business plan is more conservative than CSLD’s, and BSC was awarded slightly
       more points under criterion (c).




                                             - 41 -
      The BSC and CSLD bids are both strong and relatively equal with respect to criterion
       (d) service commitments, with both offering the required services; but with CSLD
       proposing more sites and coverage.

      Both bids were strong on local benefits. BSC may have more tendency to try to run
       operations from American Samoa (where their MSC and other operations systems are),
       but overall the two bids will likely bring similar local benefits. BSC probably understands
       the Samoan community better than Digicel, but CSL’s partnership in CSLD will likely
       offset that. Both have credible local partners. Digicel appears to have a plan to expand to
       other Pacific Islands, which could create opportunities for Samoa-based employees.

In conclusion, therefore, CSLD clearly has more telecommunications sector experience than
BSC, and definitely has a stronger financial capacity. BSC presented a more conservative, and
thus somewhat more viable business plan than CSLD. Both of the two leading bidders provided
strong, and essentially equal proposals for service commitments and local benefits.

Based on this evaluation, the comparative ranking of the applications for the digital cellular
licensing process is as follows:

      CSLD filed the highest-ranked application, met other requirements set out in the
       InfoMem, and accordingly should be treated as the successful applicant;

      BSC is ranked a strong second, but well behind CSLD; and

      The applications from ATH, PSW and SDC were ranked well below the two leading
       applications. Each of the three failed to meet one or more of the minimum points
       requirements in the evaluation process.

For these reasons, it was decided that the licence should be issued to Digicel Samoa Ltd., the
new mobile operating company formed by CSLD. Since only one licence will be issued, the
remaining four applications will be denied.

These reasons do not constitute the awarding of a licence. The licence will be issued to the
successful applicant in accordance with the conditions described in the InfoMem, including the
requirement to file of a Letter of Credit to secure performance of the licence commitments.
