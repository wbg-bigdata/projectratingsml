                         Most notable progress is in the area of the budget consolidation, i.e, so-called “off-budget funds? were consolidated into the budget, although the Social Fund remains to be linked to
                         the budget. The budget transparency has improved significantly as a result of daily publication of the budget execution data on the MoF’s website. In addition, the MoF has started
                         "e-Map" on its portal through which the amount allocated for each region can be found. An initiative for e-Procurement has begun and the work on Medium Term Budget Frame

                         (MTBF) has been progressing. The new Minister of Finance has made a decision to roll out the program budgeting in 88 budget organizations. The Task team welcomes this new
                         approach, and is ready to provide necessary support for the MoF with an emphasis on capacity building where the significant capacity constraints exist. Furthermore, the MoF has
                         launched another important reform initiative that is to prepare a Budget Code by September 2012. This is the first time that Kyrgyz MoF introduces a comprehensive Budget Code
                         which will provide a legal basis for budget ceiling for the line ministries. By June 2012 a first draft is expected to be prepared.
