1. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A. The Role of Transport
1.01     Transport is vital for the economic, political and economic devel-
opment and integration of a country as large as Turkey, with populations and
economic activities spread over a wide area and where people and goods often
have to trav-' long distances over difficult terrain under severe climatic
conditions. Its economic role extends beyond its direct contribution to GDP
and employment through its indirect impact on such related activities as
construction, manufacturing, retail trade, insurance, police and taxation.
It has been one of the more dynamic sectors of the economy prior to 1978,
when traffic growth rates were about 1-1/2 times the growth rate of GDP.
Since that time, the growth of domestic traffic was practically halted under
the impact of the increases in oil prices and the 1980 economic stabiliza-
tion policies. The transport system of Turkey provides also a vital bridge
between Europe and the Middle East.
1.02     The system consists of about 60,000 km of state and provincial
highways which comprise the heavily trafficked interurban and interregional
network; about 220,000 km of rural roads and tracks; about 8,000 route-km of
railways- about 100 port and landing facilities, including 15 major ports,
ana 16 airports of which 2 handle scheduled international traffic.
1.03     Road transport, which is in the hands of the private sector domi-
nates the industry (see Table 1.1); in 1982 it accounted for 702 and 90% of
total freight and passenger traffic respectively.  The corresponding share
of railway freight was about 10%, down from 20% in 1976 (the peak of railway
freight) and also about 10_ for railway passenger traffic. Data on coastal
traffic are not very reliable but coastal shipping's share in total freight
transport is estimated at about 20%, primarily oil products.

1.04     A  Transport  Sector  Memorandum  (TSM)  which  is  presently  being
discussed with the Government provides an overview of the current situation,
issues and prospects of the sector. Following is a summary of its principal
findings.
B. Current Situation and Issues
1.05     The Bank's knowledge of Turkey's transport sector has been progres-
sively improved since the Public Sector Investment Review of 1980.  It is
particularly derived through preparation and implementation of the ongoing
Highway Rehabilitation and Ports Rehabilitation projects and from an active
sector dialogue with the Government. However, although up-to-date knowledge
of the Highway Sector is particularly detailed and can be coordinated with
the National Transport Master Plan (NTMP), experience of other modes is less
detailed and recent work has concentrated on identifying priority institu-
tional and policy issues. Although the proposed project is designated as a
Second Highway Project, it focusses on the size, composition and quality of
the General Directorate of Highway's (KGM) investment and maintenance
programs for 1985-1988 and the arrangements for their implementation.
Expansion of Bank activity to encompass the entire transport sector will be
a step by step process, including;  (i) a dialogue on the TSM, which has
already started; (ii) a loan for the proposed Second Highway Project;
(iii) the preparation of projects for the railways and ports to address
policy and institutional issues in these modes; and (iv) a review of public
investment in the transport sector.
1.06     The transport system will have to be developed to keep pace with
the expected growth of traffic as overall economic growth resumes. Further-
more the system will have to adapt to major structural changes, in particu-
lar:
.i)   to support a shift in Turkey's foreign trade pattern, resulting
from liberalization of imports and policies to improve export
incentives, especially the increased emphasis on exports to the
Middle-East;
(ii)   to accommodate a major expansion in transit traffic between
Europe and the Middle-East;
(iii)   to meet the transport requirements of proposed new industrial
and mining developments in coal, iron ore and other basic
commodities which may lead to changes in traffic patterns and
the demand for bulk transport;
(iv)   to support  the  increasing  emphasis  on  developing  the  less
advanced areas of the country and the rapid growth of urban
centers; and
(v)   to incorporate new technological and operational developments,
especially the rapid containerization of sea-borne general
cargo.



- 3 -
1.07     Turkey's transport system has generally been able to meet transport
demand, although short-term bottlenecks do occur and transport costs are
often higher than they would be if modern equipment and the appropriate
infrabtructure were in place.  Railway bottlenecks have caused cutbacks in
production in industries such as cement, textiles and paper, and have caused
diversion to road system of bulk traffic which could be carrie  more econom-
ically by road.  At present, road transport is highly competitive and is
able to handle expeditiously the trade offered apart from occasional unusual
peak demands. Even if policy to shift large amounts of freight to railways
and coastal shipping, described in the NTMP, is successfully implemented,
highway transport would still be the major carrier. The principal problem
in this area is that the road infrastructure is below standard for current
traffic and is deteriorating seriously, especially on the principal transit
and export routes, despite an important maintenance program. The ports have
little modern container handling equipment with the result that loading and
unloading operations are sometimes very slow and costly.  The most serious
problem, however, rests with the railways where traffic is being diverted to
other modes because of the poor quality of their services and their opera-
tional capacity is so low that they cannot accept all traffic that is being
offered.
1.08     The Government will  also have  to address  some basic  issues  in
pricing, investment and in operational efficiency (para. 1.11).  Prices do
not always cover costs; road user charges on trucks may not appropriately
reflect costs, the railways operate at a loss, and port tariffs are
unrelated to the cost of specific activities.  In the area of investments,
the process from project preparation through project implementation is weak
in several key sub-sectors.  Operational efficiency is frequently wanting,
especially in the railways leading to low quality and uncompetitive
services.  To a large extent, these issues reflect institutional deficien-
cies in management, organization, staffing, etc., which will require persis-
tent and long-term efforts to remedy.
C. The National Transport Master Plan
1.09     The  Government's  plans  for  the  development  of  the  sector  are
embodied principally in the stabilization programs pursued since 1980 and,
espec'ally, in the National Transport Master Plan (NTMP) for 1983-1993,
which was approved by Government in 1982.  The principal features of the
NTMP are as follows:
(i)  total  freight  transport in ton-km is expected  to grow at an
average rate of 4% per year and total passenger-km at 4.6% per
year, assuming an average annual growth rate of GDP of 5.5%;
(ii)  total investment in the transport sector is expected to increase
from 1.66% of GDP in 1983 to 3.35% in 1993;
(iii)  an objective will be a major shift of traffic from road to rail
and coastal shipping and this has led to a corresponding policy
objective of a shift in the modal allocation of investment
mainly from roads to the railways and shipping although roads
retain the largest share;



- 4 -
(iv) an identification of transport corridors where bottlenecks exist
or are expected to arise; and
(v) major investment projects selected on the basis of a multi-
criteria analysis.
1.10     The NTMP is a valuable component in the planning process for the
sector in that it provides a first comprehensive long-term forecast of
transport demand, as well as a general framework and general directions for
the development of the sector. It also draws attention at an early stage to
several corridors where bottlenecks are likely to arise.  Furthermore, the
NTMP is to be supported by detailed five-year plans, now being prepared for
1985-89 for each mode by each agency; these plans are to be rolled over each
year. The proposed project focusses on the 1985-88 investment and mainte-
nance plan for state and provincial highways. The Bank is also discussing
the plans for railways and ports as part of the preparation of possible
projects for these modes.  Rural roads and tracks are closely associated
with rural development and need  to be  looked at in that context.   The
authorities also intend to update the NTMP every three years, the first time
in 1985, to take into account the experience with its implementation during
the preceding years and changing economic forecasts.
1.11     The TSM was initially discussed with the previous Government in
July 1983 and these discussions are continuing.  At  that  time,  a broad
consensus was reached on the principal issues in the sector and the basic
goals and policy principles to be pursued.  In particular, the authorities
agreed that tariffs should be based on costs, although specific programs to
reach this goal gradually would have to be prepared for each mode. In fact,
studies are already being carried out under the ongoing ports and highway
projects as a basis for establishing appropriate port tariffs and road user
charges.   The authorities  also  accepted  the need  for  improving  project
preparation, including the preparation of feasibility studies for major
investments, and to strengthen existing institutions with a view to raise
their performance. As explained in the following chapters, the Directorate
for Highways (KGM) in the Ministry of Public Works and Resettlement has
already made an impressive start during the past two years in introducing a
system of comprehensive detailed planning. A master plan for the develop-
ment of the ports has been prepared by Louis Berger International (USA)
while discussions are underway with the railways for the introduction of
comprehensive corporate planning.
D. Previous Bank Experience in the Transport Sector
1.12     The Bank has participated in four projects in the transport sector,
two ports projects of which one (Loan 1741-TU) is ongoing, one railway
project (Loan 893-TU - completed) and one highway project (Loan 2137-TU)
which is also ongoing and scheduled for completion in June 30, 1987.
Details of these projects and their status are included in the Project File
(see item B.19 in Annex 13). Project implementation, although experiencing
delays, has generally been satisfactory in achieving physical targets. Most
problems have occurred in implementing policy decisions.   However, during
and after preparation of the NTMP, Government has adopted a more coordinated



-5-
and realistic approach  towards  transport  sector  policy.   This has been
reflected in the quality of preparation of the proposed project and in
Government's willingness to discuss the important sectorial issues raised in
the Transport Sector Memorandum.
1.13     Onl,  the  Railway  Project  (Loan 893-TU  of  US$47 million)  which
covered the first three-year tranche of the Railways 1972-1977 Investment
Plan and closed June 30, 1981 has been the subject of a Project Completion
Report (PCR).  This PCR is currently under review by Operation Evaluation
Department which is preparing a report on the project.  The main conclusions
of the PCR were that the project was largely successful in meeting its
physical objectives, especially track renewal.  However,  it was less than
successful in achieving institutional and policy objectives, particularly
relating to improved productivity and financial viability. These issues are
being addressed in the transport sector discussions between the Bank and the
Turkish Government.
II. THE HIGHWAY SUB-SECTOR
A. The Network
2.01     Responsibility  for public  roads  is divided between KGM  of  the
Ministry  of  Public  Works  and  Resettlement  and  the  Road,  Water  and
Electricity Directorate (YSE) of the Ministry of Agriculture.l/ The KGH is
responsible for construction and maintenance of state and provincial roads
totalling about 61,000 km, of which about two-thirds are paved.  Rural roads
are part of the agricultural system and this is reflected in their being
attached to the Ministry of Agriculture for administrative purposes.  There
are some 220,000 km of rural roads and tracks, of which approximately
6,000 km were paved in 1983. During 1984 about 1,100 km of low volume roads
will be transferred from KGM to YSE, or deleted from the network, because
they are no longer considered to be of regional importance or critical to
socio-economic needs.
2.02     The state and provincial highway system is vital for the transpor-
tation system since they carry about 70% of total land freight traffic and
about 90% of land passenger traffic. A major part of the system was built
in the 1950's and 1960's and is therefore nearing the end of its normal
service life, especially since actual traffic volumes have been higher than
had been anticipated when the roads were built. Traffic counts and surveys
of existing road conditions, carried out by KGM as part of the preparation
of its five-year plan, indicate that many roads are deteriorating rapidly,
despite heavy maintenance, and carry traffic volumes in excess of economic
capacity.   Road  conditions  are  worst,  mainly,  on  the  roads  that have
experienced the rapid increase in transit and export traffic in recent
1/ Prior to 1984, the Ministry of Village Affairs was responsible for
rural roads.



years. To cope with current traffic, their pavements must be strengthened
and some roads have deteriorated to such an extent that they require
complete reconstruction.  The road rehabilitation program  initiated under
the ongoing Highway Project and to be extended under the proposed project
with Bank financing are designed to remedy this situation (para. 2.15).

B. Road Transport Industry
2.03     The road transport industry is mainly privately owned and includes
companies in a wide range of sizes, some of which are grouped into associa-
tions or cooperatives. In 1983, 682 Turkish trucking firms were engaged in
international trade with a total  capacity cf 124,000  tons.   Competition
between operators keeps tariff levels low, but they at least cover operating
costs. The rate of company failure does not present unusual problems.
2.04     Vehicle overloading is an issue,  but which  is being effectively
addressed  by  the' authorities.   New  legislation 1/  has  been  introduced
concerning penalties. This legislation contains a graduated scale of finan-
cial penalties and, although these still appear to be relatively low, the
authority to compel vehicles to unload in order to come within the legal
limits before proceeding is a very severe deterrent.   Fixed point weigh-
stations and mobile weigh-bridges procured under the ongoing Loan 2137-TU
provide adequate facilities for checking loads.
2.05     Vehicle fleet statistics in Turkey are not up-to-date.  The most
recent figures available are for 1980 and show the composition of the fleet
to be as follows:

Cars                                   710,915                      9.8
Total                  1,134,803                      8.6
Recent estimates indicate that during the period 1980/83 the numbers of
light trucks, pick-ups, buses and cars have remained relatively static,
whilst medium and heavy trucks have shoyn an increase of about 3%.  This
trend is supported by the following data in Table 2.3 on fuel consumption,
which show that gasoline consumption declined by about 16% between 1.979 and
1983, whereas diesel fuel consumption increased by about 20%.
Table 2.3: Fuel Consumption*

Gasoline       1.79    1.67    1.65    1.53        1.50
Diesel         3.65    4.05    4.03    3.93        4.40
A These figures exclude the unrecorded quantities of cheap diesel
oil imported in specially fitted out-size fuel tanks on trucks
serving the export and transit trade with Iran and Iraq.
The decline in gasoline consumption reflects a major shift from the more
powerful car type to smaller fuel efficient cars, and showe that Govern-
ment's fuel pricing policies have been effective. The rise in diesel fuel
consumption is at least partly attributable to the sharp rise in transit and
export traffic. Recent traffic counts indicate that traffic volumes on the
roads have started to increase again.
C. Highway Administration
2.06     The organization of KGM is effective and it is competent and well
run.  The labor force of KG!4, while  still large, has been reduced  from
34,200 in 1981 to 31,600 in 1983.  In general, KGM higher level staff is
competent, although in many cases refresher courses and courses designed to
expose them to up-to-date techniques of planning, supervision, and works and

2.07     Under the ongoing highway project and in preparation of the pro-
posed project, KGM has made important steps to improve its organization:
the planning staff has been strengthened and the planning approach broadened
to cover the entire network in a systematic way; a project monitoring unit
has been established which is beginning to function efficiently; the number
of field supervisory staff has been increased significantly and is being
trained to check the work of contractors, and initial steps have been taken
to improve highway safety.  The proposed project aims to consolidate and
extend the progress made in these fields (para. 3.08).
D. Engineering, Construction and Maintenance of Highways
2.08     Engineering,  construction and maintenance functions are performed
to a generally satisfactory standard by or under the supervision of KCM.
Road design standards are appropriate to traffic flows and physical charac-
teristics. Insufficient compaction of the road bed has been a fault in the
past. However, KGM is well aware of this problem and is now rigorously
addressing this issue through close supervision of new works (see item B8 of
Annex 13).
2.09     KGM  used  to  implement  75%  of  its  consLruction  work  by  force
account. This percentage is being reduced under the ongoing and proposed
projects to approximately 40%. In fact, KGM plans to increase the works to
be carried out by contract to about 75% by 1993.  The Turkish contracting
industry is large and efficient and, in 1t83, had contracted ongoing works
overseas of about US$12 billion.  The industry has adequate equipment to
take  on  the  increasing contract  works  of KGM.   Routine maintenance  is
carried out by force account. While the proportion of work carried out by
contract is scheduled to increase this is within an expanding overall
program and the work carried out by force account on the investment and
maintenance programs together would remain at about present levels.
2.10     To carry out its force account maintenance and investment opera-
tions, KGM has a fleet of about 9,000 major items of equipment spread
through 17 regional divisions.  This equipment has a replacement value of
about US$550 million. Equipment is well maintained and efficiently used.
However, due to economic and financial constraints, the equipment park is
older than economically acceptable: over 40% of the park in 1983 was older
than 11 years and this proportion would increase rapidly during the next 5
years to well over 75% of the fleet. Moreover, the composition of the fleet
has become unbalanced, mainly due to the fact that some items of equipment
wear out faster than others and also because of the declining kilometrage of
unpaved roads and the increasing kilometrage of surface dressed and bitumi-
nous concrete roads. Consequently, an equipment renewal program associated
with selective scrapping is needed urgently. The proposed program is based
on a careful analysis of needs in relation to work. About 802 of the equip-
ment to be bought is primarily for road maintenance. An exposition of this
analysis and the four-year renewal program in relation to the proposed works
program is given in Annex 1. The proposed project would finance part of the
equipment renewal program.

E. Highway Planning
2.11     Planning and  design  for  state  and  provincial  highways  is  the
responsibility of the KGM, with most work being carried out "in house" and
consultants only being used for specialized works.  In the past, planning
tended to be ^'n an ad hoc basis, and frequently national and local political
pressures led to over-ambitious programs. However, despite these pressures,
the KGM investment programs generally sought to address important needs and
were cost conscious: the road network has not been overbuilt and serves the
country well.  On advice from the Bank and in line with the framework
provided by the NTMP, KGM has improved planning discipline and has shown
greater acceptance of economic criteria in project preparation and planning
and of project monitoring.
2.12     Tnis improvement in discipline has led to the preparation of the
KGM 1984/85-88 detailed investment plan. The planning approach consists of:
(a) comprehensive detailed studies for major projects such as the proposed
second Bosphorus crossing; (b) feasibility studies by KGM for medium sized
works; *'c) analysis according to the Bank's RAM model using Turkish cost and
benefit data for smaller size highway projects; and (d) a special study of
equipment including equipment to be scrapped and to be bought, for KGM's own
forces to implement specified items of the proposed road maintenance and
investment programs.  This approach represents a major advance and places
KGM in the forefront of Turkish organizations with a country-wide approach
to investment and maintenance planning based on sound economic criteria.
However, further development and refinements of the planning process are
required as explained in more detail in Chapter IV, and these will be
pursued under the proposed project  (para. 4.04).  The rural road system
carries only about 10% of total freight ton/km, but the size of investment
resources scheduled for this sub-seckor are such that, as a first step,
appropriate socio-economic planning systems should be used based on agricul-
tural needs.
F. KGM Highway Investment Program
2.13     The total cost of KGM's 1985-88 investment program is estimated at
US$1,488 million equivalent, at April 1984 prices. The size of the program
was decided taking into account not only the needs of the network, but also
the availability of budgetary and other financing resources as well as
certain KGM staff constraints.  The program comprises:  Ci) rehabilitations,
(49% of total); (ii) paving of gravel roads to black-top standards (2X);
(iii) town bypasses (6%); (iv) gravel roads (28%); (v) bridges (3%); and
(vi) motorways (12%).
2.14     Table 2.4 also shows that  the increase  in total expenditure  is
entirely attributable to an increase in investments and that expenditures on
routine maintenance remain the same throughout the period, despite the
expected growth  of  traffic.   The  reasons  are  that  routine  maintenance
requirements will decline as more roads are rehabilitated and that KGM
expects to raise the efficiency of its routine maintenance operations with
the arrival of new replacement equipment.

2.15     The rehabilitation works include asphaltic paving of about 3,000 km
of primary roads which carry over 500 heavy vehicles a day on average, and
double surface dressing of about 4,000 km of state and provincial roads as
part of the NTMP objective of upgrading to black-top standard 70% of such
roads by 1993. Other works include road widening, short deviations, con-
struction of base and pavement, and include resealing or asphaltic overlays,
drainage works, road marking signs, short deviations and sections through
villages and towns. New surface dressing comprise the upgrading to black-
top standards of a selection of priority state and provincial roads in
conformity with the NTMP objective of paving all state roads and 70% of
provincial roads by 1993. Bypasses comprise the realignment and upgrading
oc main state roads through or around the larger towns selected on a
priority basis because of traffic congestion and urban needs. Gravel roads
comprise realignment, earthworks, drainage and gravel surfacing on sub-
standard earth and gravel roads selected on a priority basis from the state
and provincial road network. Bridge works comprise the new construction and
rehabilitation of medium sized bridges selected on the basis of struct'ral
need aid traffic safety. Motorway works mainly cover the completion of
ongoing works as well as an allocation for studies, design and the first
stages of construction of a second Bosphorus bridge and its approach roads.
A final decision on this bridge is dependent on the results of ongoing
consultancy studies.
2.16     The  investment  program will be updated by KGM  every year and
reviewed by the Bank as a basis for selecting projects for financing in the
coming year. Each project, in particular those submitted for Bank finan-
cing, will be prepared according to engineering and economic criteria agreed
during negotiations (Annex 3).

2.17     The proposed project includes support for the KGM's highway mainte-
nance program, since the proposed loan would finance new equipment zo imple-
ment the program.  Maintenance  is defined as regravelling,  patching and
repairs to pavement, bridges, shoulders, side slopes and drainage and
emergency  maintenance  such  as  snow  clearance  and  flood  repairs.   The
resources needed for this maintenance have been calculated vy KGM on the
basis of the kilometrage of roads of each type, for each year, and classi-
fied according to their maintenance requirements, which then have been
converted into resource requirements. This evaluation has been carried out
under the First Highway Project and includes the analysis of equipment
required for all KGM construction, maintenance and general services (Annex 1
and para. 3.05).
2.18     The KGM intends to further improve its maintenance and pavement
management system.  The first steps in this process are:  (i) on the basis
of technical and economic evaluation, to reschedule the amount of resealing
and replacing it with longer lasting repair or rehabilitation works; and
(ii) to provide an adequate number of suitable equipment for road mainte-
nance. To begin with, KGM is selecting obvious priority sections regionally
and deriving cost estimates of alternative solutions. This process will be
continued and the result will be reviewed annually. In conclusion, as the
maintenance program evolves, it will be subjected to additional benefit-cost
analyses and further operational planning reviews to ensure that it is
appropriately scaled and balanced.
2.19     The proposed expenditure program is in line with the proposals of
the NTM4P. It is based on the assumption that GDP would grow at an average
rate of 5.5% per year and road passenger and freight traffic at 4% and 4.6%
respectively. On these assumptions the proposed increase in the expenditure
program over the years is reasonable. In fact, the assumed traffic growth
may be too low, since experience during previous years indicates that road
traffic growth clearly exceeded the growth of GDP.  In other words,  the
proposed increase in expenditure is in line, or below the growth in traffic
that can be expected, even if actual growth of GDP were somewhat lower than
assumed. KGM has estimated that road traffic increased in 1984, at a rate
of about 4%.
2.20     Government tax revenues should normally increase at about the same
rate as GDP and should therefore be able to cover the increase of KGM
expenditures. However, GDP growth could be lower than assumed in view of
the slow pace of world wide economic recovery and Government's continuing
efforts to stabilize the economy. In this event, modest downward adjustment
of the investment program may become necessary by postponing the start of
some new activities. Table 2.7 shows proposed program financing.

2.22          KGM and YSE highway expenditures are primarily financed through the
budget. The NTMP states that road users will have to pay the cost of the
roads by means of road user charges and tolls (para. 1.11). The revenues
from road user charges are estimated as follows in Table 2.6:
Table 2.6: Revenue from Road User Charges and
Highway Expenditures (1979-83)

2.23          The above table shows that total revenues from road user charges
continue to exceed total highway expenditure by a significant amount despite
the fact that, in real terms, the revenues from licence fees have declined
and also that the revenues from taxes on vehicles and spare parts have been
depressed after 1979 as purchases of new vehicles have fallen.



- 13 -
2.24     In November 1983, the pump prices of gasoline and diesel fuel were
US$0.48 and USt0.32 per liter, respectively. These prices have kept pace
with inflation since 1980 and exceed border prices by a substantial margin,
even in the case of diesel fuel. The price of diesel fuel is low by Western
European standards, but similar to US prices; the price of gasoline is at
the low end of Western European prices, but much higher than in the US.
Nonetheless, while trucks pay substantial user charges through a tax incor-
porated in the fuel prices, it remains to be demonstrated that they pay
their fair share of the cost of road-use, especially since the scale of
licence fees for different vehicles may not fully reflect differences in
road damage by each type of vehicle. Under the ongoing highway project, KGM
undertook a study on axle load control, which included an analysis of heavy
vehicle user charges.  The study was scheduled to have been completed in
December 1983. By that time, KGM had completed most of the study and had
started to implement axle load control and to require off-loading of over-
loads as penalty for overloading (para. 2.04). However, the study component
on assessing annual licence fees on heavy vehicles, to reflect the cost of
the damage they cause to the roads, had not been completed by the end of
1983. KGM has agreed to a new work plan and timetable for the completion of
the study by December 1985.
2.25     The planned overall financing of the KGM 1985-88 Highway Investment
and Maintenance Program is summarized in Table 2.7 and it can be seen that
estimated road user revenues should be adequate to cover total costs in 1984
prices.

H. Performance of First Highway Project
2.26        The   First   Highway   Rehabilitation   Project   (Loan 2137-TU)   became
effective   in   August   1982.             It   concentrated   on:   (i)  rehabilitation   of
highways critical to the export trade and the valuable transit traffic;
(ii) improved highway planning and control; (iii) traffic safety and vehicle
load controls; and (iv) training. Although it is a first highway project,
careful preparation and close supervision together with a basically simple
design have resulted in satisfactory progress in achieving both its physical
and institutional objectives within KGM. In particular, we would highlight:
(a a major advance in project evaluation and the preparation of soundly
based investments; (b) establishment of an effective project monitoring
unit; (c) the acceptance of ICB for civil works; (d) strengthening the field
supervision of civil works under contract; and (e) significant advances in
technical aspects of civil works, design and construction.



- 15 -
2.27     Despite  initial  problems with  the adopt-ion  of new  construction
techniques, the works are of good quality and have proceeded quite well as
is reflected in the rate of disbursements.  Delays 1iave, however, occurred
in meeting loan covenants requiring Government: (i) 7o study and prepare a
highway safety program; and (ii) to study the incremencal damaging effect of
heavy vehicles in relation to vehicle taxation. The study of -ighway safety
has proved much more difficult to carry out than was envisaged at the time
of appraisal. However, progress is now being made in implementing certain
fundamental safety measures, including crash barriers, road signs and
markings and traffic police seminars, without waiting for the results of the
study. KGM has agreed to a new study schedule with a provisional Phase I
target completion date of December 1985 and the Phase II by December 1986.
This phase would include identification of "black-spots" on the network and
a program of remedial work.   To assist in carrying out this work on a
continuous basis KGM proposes to recruit one or two English speaking traffic
and highway safety specialists to its permanent staff as a matter of
urgency. KGM has already complied with the greater part of the covenant
relating to heavy vehicle control, but the complementary study of the
incremental damaging effect of heavy vehicles and possible modifications to
taxation levels is also a more complex task than originally envisaged.
Based on a review of the situation, especially relating to data availabil-
ity, a new work program has been prepared by KGM and is scheduled for
completion  in December  1985.   It  should  be  emphasized,  moreover,  that
overloading is not a major problem on Turkish roads and that overall road
user revenues are adequate to cover highway costs.
2.28     Staff training under the ongoing  project has  been  carried  out
through short overseas  courses  for  senior  and middle management.   This
training has proved useful and will be continued and expanded under the
proposed project (para. 3.08). At the same time regular seminars are being
held by KGM in Turkey to train and upgrade its supervisory personnel; this
program will also continue.
III. THE PROJECT
A. Objectives
3.01     The proposed project would continue and expand upon the objectives
of the First Highway Project, whose primary objective was to support KGM in
the preparation  and  implementation  of  a  sound  investment  program.   In
particular, the proposed project focusses on the identification, prepara-
tion, planning and implementation processes adopted by KGM.  To this end,
the proposed project would address key aspects and components of KGM's
1985-88 investment, maintenance and equipment programs, with the Bank
financing selected components of these programs.  At the same time,  the
proposed project would help improve pavement research and management,
computerization, and equipment management.



- 16 -
3.02     The objectives of the proposed project, which correspond closely to
NTMP objectives, are: first, to promote comprehensive highway planning and
control systems for both capital investments and maintenance works; second,
to improve, through rehabilitation and strengthening, priority and quick
benefit yielding sections of the highway network, in particular those
sections which contribute towards foreign exchange earnings; third, to
develop the management system of a well balanced equipment fleet in KGM;
fourth, to develop road pavement research and management; fifth, to ensure
appropriate road user taxation for heavy vehicles; sixth, to provide
training for highway staff; and seventh, to continue a highway safety
program currently being implemented under the ongoing Highway Rehabilitation
Project.
B. Description of the Project
3.03     The components of the proposed project are:
(a)  selected sub-projects from KGM's civil works investment program
covering road sections to be started during 1985-88;
(b)  procurement  of  equipment  and  spare  parts  needed by KGM  to
modernize its highway investment and maintenance equipment fleet;
(c)  fellowships for training KGM staff; and
(d)  consultant services for KGM to promote pavement research and
planning, and for other services related to the KGM investment
program.
Civil Works
3.04     The first-year program of road rehabilitation to be financed under
the proposed loan has been identified from the KGM 1985-88 investment
program.  It includes six road sections of which one, Akyarma-Gerede of
37 km is situated on the Ankara-Istanbul highway and five sections cover the
first 242 km, from Gerede to Osmancik of the Northern branch of Trans-Turkey
Highway which leads to the Iranian border crossing point at Gorbulak. The
details of these highway sections are shown in Annex 4.  The work would
comprise rehabilitation and upgrading of the existing road including earth-
works, drainage, bridges and pavement.   On the section Akyarma-Gerede a
second carriageway will be constructed in continuation of the program to
transform the Ankara-Istanbul highway into a dual carriageway road, which is
fully justified by the traffic level (para. 4.09).  Sections located on the
Northern Trans-Turkey Highway will have their pavement widened to 7.2 or
7.0 m and strengthened to bear heavy international transit traffic.
Detailed engineering of roads included in the first-year program is being
completed and implementation schedules in the form of critical path diagrams
have been prepared (Annex 7). The engineering design was carried out satis-
factorily by KGM in-house, to the design standards included in the Detail
Master Plan 1983-93 (Annex 13, Bll).

Equipment and Spare Parts for Mechanical Services
3.05     K-Uli nas carried cut a study of the new equipment and spare parts
needs  which  represent  27% of  the  total  revised  fleet  over  the  period
1985-88. The study also covered the control and costing system to be used.
The equipment renewal program invjilves both international and local procure-
ment (Annex 2,. The proposed loan would finance, in the 1985-88 four-year
program, equipment and spare parts procured under ICB estimated at
US$92 million equivalent, and equipment and spare parts procured under LCB
procedures acceptable to the Bank and open to foreign bidders estimated at
US$31.7 million equivalent.   The remaining equipment to be procured under
reserved procedures is estimated at US$32 million equivalent and will be
financed entirely by the Government. The equipment to be procured under LCB
consists of items for which Turkish suppliers are in a strong competitive
position (para. 3.23).
3.06     Spare parts inventory and use management  are the primary areas
needing improvement in KGM's mechanical services.  These improvements are
being undertaken by KGM. Details of the status and requirements for control
over the fleet and spares, are at Annex 1 and in Bank's report "Overall
Equipment Services Study for the Turkish Public Sector" dated September 12,
1983, which is in the Project File.
3.07     Initially a short training course abroad for 3 middle management
staff has been arranged for mid-1984 under the First Highway Project to
assist in the development of a computerized management information system
for the mechanical services. Following this introductory course, KGM will
draw up a program and schedule for implementing the control and management
system for equipment.
Fellowships
3.08     To assist KGM in improving its planning, control over the equipment
fleet and spare parts inventory, design and construction, and for pavement
research and management, a program of fellowships abroad (about 250 man-
months depending upon cost) are proposed for its technical staff.  These
fellowships are a continuation of the 60 man-months provided under the First
Highway Project.   The fellowships will be provided in Western Europe, by
agencies such as contractors, consultants, State Highway Departments and
Universities.  In particular, a training program (10 man-months) has already
been drawn up to assist senior mechanical and computer staff of KGM to set
up and implement their equipment control program under the First Highway
Project. This program and the remaining fellowships will be arranged by the
KGM Training Department directly with the agencies concerned.  Particular
attention will be paid to the need to have planning and executive staff
trained in modern pavement management techniques and methods as a stage in
introducing modern pavement management systems. Detailed program of fellow-
ships will be reviewed by the Bank annually during the overall annual
program reviews (para. 3.25).



- 18 -
Consultancy Services
3.09     The project would include approximately 200 man-months of consul-
tancy services to KGM in such fields as: (i) engineering design and supervi-
sion of large and complex projects; (ii) pavement research and management;
(iii) improvements of highway safety; and (iv) continuation of research of
pavement deterioration under heavy vehicles, all as may be agreed with the
Government.
3.10     A design and supervision contract for the second Bosphorus bridge
was signed on December 2, 1983, between KGM and Freeman Fox and Partners
associated  with  a  Turkish  firm,  BOTEK.   The  cost  of  the  contract  is
US$5.5 million equivalent, for a duration of 18 months for studies and 42
months for supervision of works. The Bank is financing 85% of the cost for
updating the feasibility study (about US$30,000 equivalent), under the First
Highway Project, but its subsequent participation in the cost for the
design, documentation and supervision components of this consultancy
contract, under either the First Highway Project or the proposed loan, is
conditional upon the completion of a feasibility study acceptable to the
Bank and the proposed investment showing an acceptable rate of return.
3.11     The  objectives  and  terms  of  reference  for  pavement  research
(Annex 5), and the need for the services of highly specialized experts were
confirmed  between  the  Government  and  the  Bank  at  negotiations.   The
project's objectives to improve highway safety and to ensure economically
based heavy vehicles taxation may also require specialized consultancy
services.  The progress of highway safety program and the status of road
user charges will be reviewed at the annual project reviews (para. 3.25).
C. Cost Estimates
3.12     The estimated total base cost of the total 1985-1988 investment and
maintenance program (including about US$200 million of taxes and duties) is
US$2,137 million equivalent, of which US$1,235 million are estimated to be
foreign costs. Government's policy is to adjust the financing requirements
to reflect inflation annually through the investment and current budgets
process;  this procedure has worked satisfactorily.  A summary of the cost
estimates is shown in Table 3.1.  The estimated cost of the Project, i.e.
Part A of the program to be financed under the proposed loan, is
US$232 million equivalent, including a foreign exchange component equivalent
to US$185.9 million.

3.13           The costs of highway rehabilitation put forward by the Government
for Bank financing under the first year of the proposed loan, are based on
quantities which are derived from the engineering already done and the -.vC's
1984 unit price schedule for contract works. These costs are comparable to
those obtained from bidding on similar works in Turkey.   Costs  for the
rehabilitation in subsequent years are based upon the costs of the first
year's program. For 1984, the foreign exchange component of the total cost
of pavement works is estimated at 65%, and of related earthworks and
drainage works at 49%, based on a foreign exchange rate of TL 320 = US$1.
Five percent quantity contingencies have been allowed for civil works.



- 20 -
3.14     The costs of the remainder of the highway investment program and
the maintenance program are based on preliminary estimates of quantities per
km by KGM based upon a positive identification and detailed assessment of
each road section concerned. These quantities have been multiplied by KGM's
1984 schedules of unit prices for contract and force account work (as the
case may be).  Physical contingencies are not included for the investment
and maintenance programs as a whole, since the extent and timing of works
will be reviewed annually by the Government to ensure appropriate works are
carried out within the financial constraint of the Government's financing
plans.
3.15     Since KGM is exempt from custom duties and sales taxes on equipment
purchases, the capital cost of equipment and spares has been estimated using
1983 CIF prices for imported goods, net of import duties, and the ex-factory
costs net of taxes for local goods.  For locally supplied equipment,  the
cost of the foreign component ex-factory is estimated at about 70% of total
cost.   All  equipment  costs  include  an  allowance  of  about  15%  for  the
purchase of spare parts. On the above basis, total equipment costs for the
four-year renewal program 1985-88 are about US$156 million equivalent
including spare parts, of which US$92 million will be procured through ICB
and US$32 million will be procured through LCB open to foreign bidders and
financed under the  proposed  loan.   The remaining  US$32 million will  be
financed by the Government under reserved procurement.
3.16     Fellowship costs are based on current costs in Western Europe of
US$2,500 per man-month. For consultancy services on pavement research and
such other needs as may be agreed, a lump sum of US$2.3 million is included,
based on 1984 prices.
3.17     In TL terms, the price contingency allowance for civil works is 20%
for 1985, 15% for 1986 and 12% p.a. thereafter, and the corresponding
US Dollar price contingencies are 7.5% for 1984, 7% for 1985 and 6% p.a.
thereafter.   No price  contingencies  in US$  terms have  been allowed  on
equipment,  training,  or  consultancy  services  since  recent  experience
indicates that no significant increase over 1984 prices on these items is
expected.
D. Financing
3.18     The overall financing plan for the KGM 1985-88 highway investment
and maintenance program is discussed in para. 2.25. Details of the proposed
project financing plan are given at Table 3.2. It shows overall expenditure
of TL 74.24 billion (April 1984 costs) with the World Bank financing 80%
(the estimated foreign exchange component) and the remaining 20% being
financed  by  Government.   The  evaluation  of  the  entire  investment  and
maintenance program provides scope for adding additional external financing
at a later stage if Government so desires.

3.19     The proposed loan would finance the following components selected
-within  the  1985-88  investment  and  maintenance  program  as  follows:
(i) contracts for civil works on selected road sections to be initiated
durinr 1985-88 period to be submitted by KGM to the Bank in accordance with
agreed orocedures; (ii) contracts for equipment and related spare parts for
the KGM maintenance and construction fleet; (iii) fellowship training; and
(iv) specified consultant services.  The Government agreed at negotiations
that it will provide funds for the local costs of project, as and when
required.
E. Implementation
3.20     KGM will be responsible  for  implementing all components of the
project.  KGM will be responsible for overall loan and project administra-
tion.  These arrangements were agreed with the Government at negotiations.
Project implementation will be based upon detailed annual project implemen-
tation scheduling similar to that carried out for the First Highway Project
and estimated to be spread over a six-year period ending December 1990,
since some works contracted, especially in the later years of the program,
will have to be completed after the end of the program period.  Critical
path analysis is used for each component of project implementation: an
example for one of the first year's highway rehabilitation sections is shown
at Annex 7.   A  summarized  Overall  Implementation  Schedule  is  shown  at
Annex 8. The Overall Implementation Schedule has been adjusted to allow one
extra year to complete the rehabilitation works in line with the Bank's
projects profiles.  The project completion date is therefore estimated at
December 31, 1990.  During negotiations,  KGM confirmed  the  implementation
schedule (Annex 8).

3.21     Contracts for paving or rehabilitation works will be let in two
phases, the first in 1985 and the second in 1986.  Civil works needed ahead
of pavement rehabilitation will be carried out under separate contracts in
advance of the paving contracts because of seasonal factors and because the
nature of these works do not lend themselves to cost effective combination
with the major paving contracts. These advance works comprise intermittent
and variable works such as road widening, supply and stockpiling of mate-
rials in advance, minor route deviations, small bridges, extensions of
culverts and the preparation of work sites and camps.  In addition, it is
necessary to have contracts spread over time and space to facilitate traffic
control on major transport routes and to take advantage of short working
seasons, particularly in northern and eastern Turkey.   Let separately to
smaller local contractors,  similar advance works under the First Highway
Project have proved  cost-effective  and  practical.   In order  to provide
necessary flexibility it has also been agreed to aliow up to US$9 million of
paving contracts below US$3 million each to be procured under LCB acceptable
to the Bank and freely open to foreign contractors. KGM will supervise the
rehabilitation contracts with its own staff through its field divisions
under both Divisional and Head Office controls.
3.22     KGM is developing adequate resources for supervision of contract
works and has included training courses for its staff since 1981 to build up
the quality of its control.  KGM is further developing its Project Control
and Coordinating Team to coordinate the standards and timing of construction
and design, to deal with financing arrangements and to develop management
information and reporting systems for the implementation of the investment
program (para. 3.25 and Annex 10). During negotiations, KGM agreed to main-
tain its Project Monitoring and Control team and to develop it as necessary
to meet its responsibilities under the proposed project.
3.23     Equipment to be procured by the KGM under ICB and LCB will be in
three tranches, the first in 1985, (40% of total) the second in 1986 and the
third in 1987 (each 30% of total).  Smaller and more frequent tranching has
not been recommended in order that KGM may develop an adequate degree of
standardization in its fleet, without detracting from competitive supply.
It was agreed at negotiations that about US$32 million of equipment was
appropriate for local competitive bidding acceptable to the Bank and open to
foreign suppliers. Domestic manufacturers of equipment items to be procured
under LCB (Annex 2) are actively competing in the market and the chance of
foreign suppliers winning a contract is low.  The equipment to be procured
in each tranche should be agreed at the annual reviews for the forthcoming
year, starting with the October 1984 review.  This procedure was confirmed
by the Government at negotiations.
3.24     The fellowships under the proposed project are a continuation and
expansion of those under the First Highway Project and are expected to
commence in 1985 and be complete by 1989.   Consultancy  services will be
based upon scheduling proposed by KGM and will be in agreement with the
Bank. It is estimated that these studies will start before mid-1985 and be
completed by the end of 1990.

3.25     Project monitoring and reporting procedures include the preparation
by KGM of: (i) indicative multi-year overall project programs on an annual
basis; (ii) detailed annual programs each year, including the results of
project implementation during the past years; (iii) quarterly progress
reports on Bank-financed elements (physical and financial); (iv) feasibility
study reports as required for the investment and maintenance programs;
(v) bid evaluation reports; and (vi) audit reports prepared by Ministry of
Finance inspectors on Bank-financed elements of the project supported by
detailed official investment and maintenance budgets showing previous years
expenditure and proposed expenditure on a project by project basis. Details
of the required reports and programs are shown at Annex 9. Annually, and
not later than October 31 of each year, commencing with 1985, the Government
and the Bank will review; Ci) project performance during the current year;
(ii) the detailed work and training programs of the project for the forth-
coming year; (iii) the next year's selection of sub-proiects for financing
under the loan; (iv) the proposed next year's procurement of equipment;
Cv) the indicative program of highway investment and maintenance for the
remainder of the four-year period, 1985-88; and (vi) the progress of highway
safety program and status of road user charges. During negotiations, agree-
ment was reached on the annual review arrangements.
3.26     A format of quarterly  financial  reports has  been designed  and
agreed with the KGM for purposes of monitoring project expenditure, finan-
cing resources and Bank disbursements. These financial reporting arrange-
ments were agreed at negotiations.  Financial control procedures are essen-
tially based on a priori checking. During negotiations, the Government and
the Bank agreed the reporting procedures (para. 3.25) and the auditing
requirements for the project, and that the KGM will submit to the Bank not
later than September 30  each year,  starting  in  1986,  appropriate  audit
reports for the preceding financial year (Turkish FY ending December 31).
3.27     The base cost of civil works which KGM intends to submit for finan-
cing under the loan are estimated to cost about US$83 million equivalent
(US$106 million including contingencies), of which US$63 million equivalent
(US$79 million including contingencies) would be let under ICB for paving
contracts.   Small  paving  contracts,  less  th.aa  US$3 million  equivalent,
within an aggregate ceiling of US$9 million equivalent, including contingen-
cies, may be let under LCB procedures acceptable to the Bank and open to
foreign contractors. Contracts for earthworks, small bridges and ancillary
works less than US$3 million equivalent each, within an aggregate ceiling of
US$13 million equivalent (US$18 million including contingenzits) will be let
under LCB under terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank and for which
foreign contractors would also be eligible.   It is expected that foreign
contractors will win 25% of the ICB paving contracts and that local firms
will win all the earthwork and drainage contracts.
3.28     Equipment and spares to be financed under the loan are estimated at
US$123.7 million equivalent of which US$92 million will be let under ICB and
US$31.7 million will be let under LCB acceptable to the Bank and open to
foreign manufacturers. The equipment and spares to be procured under LCB is
equipment that can be supplied by Turkish manufacturers.   It is expected
that local suppliers will win about two-third of LCB equipment contracts.

F. Procurement
3.29     Consultant services will be provided in accordance with terms and
conditions satisfactory to the Bank, and training fellowships proposed will
be reviewed in advance by the Bank. A summary of procurement is given in
Table 3.3 and full details of procurement procedures are set out in
Annex 11. These procurement procedures were agreed between the Government
and the Bank at negotiations.

3.31     The closing date for the proposed loan is June 30, 1991.  To enable
prompt payment of all reimbursable expenses, and as the Government
requested, provision will be made tor a revolving fund through a special
account in US$, opened and operated in a Turkish Bank authorized te deal in
foreign exchange.   On loan effectiveness,  the World Bank would disburse
immediately into this account US$9 million, an estimated three-months needs
of the World Bank share of eligible expenditures.   The account would be
replenished periodically on the basis of withdrawal applications supported
by the correspondent bank's statements of account and details of expendi-
tures.   During negotiations  agreement  was  reached  on  this  disbursement
mechanism.



- 26 -
3.32     So as not to discriminate against the use of local consultants and
to avoid the Borrower having to finance a proportion of foreign costs, the
Bank will disburse against 100% of total expenditures for consulting
services. The schedule of cumulative disbursements (Annex 12) is based upon
the implementation schedule showing the first batch of equipment and civil
works contracts being let in 1985.   This schedule was confirmed by the
Government at negotiations.
H. Environmental Impact
3.33     The environmental impact of the project will be favorable.  Con-
tinued actions to improve highway safety and to control vehicle size and
loading are positive environmental objectives.  Moreover,  the longer term
objective to divert through traffic away from city and village centers where
this is economically viable would have favorable impact on the environment.
IV. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A. Introduction and Economic Context
4.01     An overview of the KGM highway investment and maintenance program
for 1985-88 is given in Chapter II. The main thrust of the program is on
the rehabilitation and improvement of existing roads, especially those roads
serving foreign currency earning activities, and their periodic and routine
maintenance.   The  related  expenditures  account  for  about  86%  of  total
proposed expenditures during 1985-88.
B. Investment Program
4.02     The initial investment proposals were originated by KGM's regional
offices on the basis of their knowledge of the network and by the central
government.  In total, 610 individual works were proposed and subsequently
evaluated using the RAM model developed in the Bank. As a result, KGM has
retained 226 proposals for the investment program, including 180 ongoing
projects and 46 new projects. Although the RAM model and data inputs have
some limitations, its use by KGM as a first step in a comprehensive evalua-
tion exercise is acceptable. During the coming years, KGM intends to refine
the data input and use of the model and to test more advanced models such as
the Bank's Highway Design and Maintenance Model III (HDM) and/or the Trans-
port Investment Model II (RTIM) of the Road Research Laboratory in the UK.
4.03     The following Table 4.1 summarizes the results of the cost-benefit
analysis carried out by KGM.

Annual Cost
Note:
1. It is not possible to calculate a mean rate of return for this total program, since it includes many
ongoing projects for which no rate of return was estimated. However, the mission estimates abour 27%.
2. The annual totals in Table 4.1 will be seen to be lower than those in Table 2.4. This is due to:
(a) Table 2.4 includes tax elements whilst Table 4.1 is net of tax; and (b) Table 2.4 is based on
investment targets whilst Table 4.1 excludes projects which remain to be evaluated before inclusion in
the outer years.
Source: KGM
4.03      The above results show some interesting trends; in particular, that
between 1984 and 1988 the number of projects per year is steadily declining
from 195 to 117 and the average cost per project is rising from TL 387
million to TL 632 million. These trends reflect an effort by KGM to concen-
trate its resources on fewer projects to ensure their speedier completion
and thereby to improve the efficiency and benefits of its investments.
4.04      The proposed investment program, which  is  estimated  to yield an
overall rate of return of about 27%, is balanced and in keeping with identi-
fied  national  priorities.   The  evaluation  of  sub-projects,  according  to
special studies or through using the Bank RAM model, shows that about 75%
yield rates of return in excess of 10% and 25% yield rates of return of less
than 10%. These results require interpretation. Typically about 80% of the
low yielding sub-projects are physically ongoing and a legacy of the past
whilst about 20% or 25% of the total program are in the program's outer
years, and the majority are low standard earth or gravel roads in less
developed regions carrying low traffic volumes and which are to be upgraded
to  all-weather  paved  standards.   Whilst  it  is  not  practicable  to  stop
ongoing works, continued close cooperation with KGM should permit outer year
projects to be reevaluated as part of a continuing review process. Although
sub-project analysis data inputs are considered to be realistic they are
rather limited and reevaluation should take into account a broader range of
data, in particular: (i) actual traffic growth will probably be higher than
the assumed growth rates; (ii) generated traffic is probably understated for
sub-projects designed to achieve major improvements in operating conditions;
and (iii) neither passenger value of time benefits nor benefits from
improved safety have been included.



- 28 -
4.05     The KGM "Detailed Plan" for 1985-88 describes in its chapter on
"Network Review" that a major goal is to ascertain the economic benefits of
each of the routes of the existing network and to stop investments in roads
that are  found to be uneconomic.   Furthermore,  the KGM has  applied an
evaluation methodology satisfactory to the Bank to the entire 1985-88
investment  plan.   Since appraisal,  the KGM  program  of reevaluation has
continued as a result of which approximately 1,100 km of road may be elimi-
nated from the network and this will include some of the uneconomic
proposals.  Also evaluation data inputs are being re-examined and this may
also lead to modifications in the program and reduce the apparently uneco-
nomic element.
4.06     Taking the above considerations into account, the results of the
cost-benefit analysis indicate that the rehabilitation and periodic mainte-
nance program proposed by KGM for 1985-88 is sound. Within this program,
KGM intends to submit specific projects for financing under the proposed
loan.   These projects will be documented and evaluated  according to an
agreed methodology and criteria, as indicated in Annex 3.  Major complex
projects will be documented by comprehensive feasibility studies governed by
specific terms of reference; important but relatively straight forward
projects by feasibility studies prepared by KGM and relatively small and
simple projects by an evaluation using the RAM model only.
4.07     Within  this  program,  KGM  has  proposed  for Bank  financing  the
improvement of six contracts (see Annex 4 - Map IBRD 17913) on two main
highways, to be started during the first year of the project period.  In
fact, some advance works will already have been completed before the loan
becomes effective. The results of cost-benefit analyses in the feasibility
studies are as follows:

4.08     These six contracts are located on the main Istanbul-Ankara road
and on the northern Istanbul to Iran road. The Istanbul-Ankara road is an
important link between, not only the political and commercial centers of the
country, but also between the central and southern regions and the interna-
tional routes to Syria and Iraq.  The Istanbul-Iran road serves domestic
traffic in the northern third of Turkey, including the Black Sea coast and



- 29 -
several major ports, and also the valuable export and transit traffic to
Iran. Feasibility studies of the routes on which the proposed contracts are
located have been prepared by the KGM Planning Department and are included
in the Project File (Annex 13).
4.09     Ankara-Gerede Road Km 100 to 137.  In 1984, this road is forecast
to carry about 1980 light vehicles and 3,570 heavy vehicles daily, equiva-
lent to a passenger car unit count (pcu) of between 16,000 and 17,000 per
day. Such levels of traffic in rural areas normally warrant dual carriage-
way standards  on economic and safety grounds.   Future traffic growth is
expected to be at least 5% p.a. The proposed contract of 37 km covers the
second carriageway part of this road, where earthworks are virtually
complete. KGM proposes to complete construction of this carriageway and to
strengthen and rehabilitate the existing road.  In addition to conventional
savings from vehicle operating costs due to improved surface conditions and
reduced congestion, which yield a rate of return of 83%, the proposed works
will probably lead to a reduced accident rate, which will oe monitored under
a continuing road safety research program.
4.10     Gerede-Osmancik  242 km.   In  1984  this  road  is  forecast  to be
carrying about 535 light vehicles and 1250 heavy vehicles daily giving a pcu
count of about 5,500 per day. Since traffic is expected to grow at least 5%
per annum, pavement reconstruction and strengthening to a bituminous
concrete standard is justified. In addition to savings in vehicle operating
costs, due to improved road conditions, benefits also include savings from a
70 km distance reduction for traffic which is expected to divert from the
crowded southern route through Ankara and Delice:  in total the sub-project
will yield an ERR of about 66%. In 1983, export and transit traffic to Iran
comprised about 50% of the heavy traffic on the Gerede-Osmancik road;
transit traffic grew by about 40% p.a. between 1980 and 1983, but this
growth rate is expected to be lower in future years. However, even assuming
constant traffic the payback period for the investment is estimated at 2-1/2
years. Foreign exchange income from transit traffic on the road is esti-
mated at about US$250 million p.a.
C. Equipment and Spare Parts
4.11     KGM has justified the proposed list of equipment to be procured by
a comprehensive evaluation of total equipment requirements to carry out its
force account operations in maintenance and construction, taking into
account that the share of force account construction in total investment is
planned to decline from 50% currently to 25% by 1993.  These requirements
have subsequently been compared with the fleet of available equipment, after
a comprehensive survey of the exis'ing fleet and the elaboration of a
program for the selective scrapping of old equipment.   About 80% of the
proposed equipment procurement is required to support the periodic and
routine maintenance program (Annex 1). The highway maintenance program has
been reviewed by the Bank and found to be technically sound, financially
reasonable and relevant to the system's  needs.   The highway maintenance
program consists essentially of two parts, routine maintenance and periodic
maintenance (included in the investment program), both of which are essen-
tial to at least preserve the existing capital assets: the average cost in



- 30 -
1984 prices is US$3,800 per km. The program has been based on detailed road
condition inventories and proposed physical changes, such as pavement
upgrading, over the next five years together with data on geophysical and
climatic  conditions  and  traffic.   The  economic  justification  for  the
proposed expenditure is deemed obvious, in that maintenance is necessary to
protect the capital investment and is carried out at relatively low cost
- probably averaging between 1% and 2% of vehicle operating costs on good
pavements.   Recent  experience  shows  that  highway  maintenance  programs
typically yield rates of return in excess of 100% and there is no reason for
suggesting that Turkey will not follow this pattern.  Under these circum-
stances a calculation of a unique rate of return for the RGM maintenance
program would not be particularly  useful.   The  question of the correct
balance between highway maintenance and highway improvement is a related
issue which is currently being addressed in Turkey under research into and,
eventual, implementation of a modern pavement management system.  KGM has
started to compare the cost of routine and periodic maintenance with the
cost of rehabilitation and pavement works, which in many cases may be a
partial  alternative.   These  analyses  consist  of  a  simplified  approach,
derived from feasibility studies carried out under the Highway Rehabilita-
tion Project, using as input traffic flows, vehicle operating costs, and
estimated pavement condition in relation to design standards and maintenance
routines.
4.12     The problem with the existing fleet is that normal replacement has
not taken place during the past few years, especially due to the shortage of
foreign exchange.  As a result, a substantial part of the fleet is old and
should be scrapped and replaced.   In addition, certain types of equipment
are in short supply and need to be acquired to meet the changing character
of KGM operations, especially for the rapidly expanding program of pavement
resealing. KGM has estimated the total value of equipment to be procured at
about US$156 million during the 1985-88 program. When procurement is com-
pleted, the size of the fleet will be smaller than at present.
4.13     The  evaluation process  of  the  equipment  fleet  and  spare parts
inventory also revealed that inventory control and management procedures are
somewhat out-of-date and should be made more efficient to save resources.
KGM is considering proposals to this end, including the introduction of
standard coding, computerization and other modern equipment management
procedures and practices.  If implemented successfully, this approach could
also be implemented by other government agencies with large equipment
fleets.  As a first step towards its implementation,  the KGM is already
undertaking fellowships under the First Highway Project for senior officials
to familiarize themselves with modern equipment management and spare parts
systems in other countries (para. 3.07).
D. Training and Consultancy Services
4.14     It is not possible to provide a quantified "economic" or financial
justification for the proposed training or consultancy service components.
Both are necessary for the successful achievement of the project's objec-
tives of higher professional standards and the introduction of improved
techniques in the KGM and more effective planning. Furthermore, they should



- 31 -
also lead to: (i) improvements in highway safety; (ii) more economically
based road user taxations; and (iii) advances in pavement management and
research, especially the use of less expensive road construction materials
and methods.
E. Project Risk
4.15     The  prospects  for  satisfactory  project  implementation  are  good
considering that KGM has the capacity to meet the proposed expansion in its
activities and that the proposed increase in its expenditures, at an average
annual rate of 4% during the next four years, is in line with the forecast
growth in overall economic activity and government revenue.
4.16     The principal risks for the project are that government austerity
measures would lead to a decline in available finance; or that traffic,
particularly transit traffic, would be sharply reduced.  In the event of a
curtailment of government funding, the investment program would have to be
adjusted, preferably by postponing or eliminating investments of lesser
priority. As to a reduction of transit traffic, the prospects are that a
high volume of transit traffic will continue to be needed to meet the
demands of reconstruction after the Iran/Iraq conflict.   Furthermore, any
reduction in such traffic could be gradually compensated by rising volumes
of Turkish exports to the area.  At worst under these circumstances, the
benefits from the proposed investments on these transit routes could be
lower than expected, but still sufficiently high to more than justify the
planned investments.
V. RECOMMENDATIONS
5.01     During loan negotiations, the Government confirmed;

STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT OF
A SECOND HIGHWAY PROJECT
Analysis of KGM Equipment Requirements
Equipment Fleet Status
1.       According to the Highway Master Plan (September  1982)  equipment
fleet of the General Directorate of Highways (KGM) was composed of 18,664
items,  of which about half were auxiliary and miscellaneous units.  The
replacement value of the fleet was US$555 million, including about US$60
million for auxiliary units and about US$184 million for equipment in scrap
condition (para.  7).  The main characteristic of equipment fleet is its
advanced age:  In 1982, 26% of principal items were over 15 years old and
further 21% over 10 years, while only 20% were in the group below 5 years.
The details of fleet composition are shown in Table 1.
2.       Another important deficiency of equipment fleet is lack of balance
among the principal units required for efficient performance of work.  Due
to more rapid wear and tear of graders, dozers, loaders, dumpers and bitumen
distributors the proportion of such equipment in scrap condition is higher
than for other types of equipment.
3.       The utilization of equipment beyond its useful life, which is con-
sidered to be below 10 and maximum 15 years, was possible only because of
the excellent capability and capacity of the KGM central, regional and
district workshops, which carry out not only maintenance, repairs and over-
haul, but also converting and rebuilding of old units. However, keeping old
equipment working is costly, for the cost of spare parts required grows with
the age of machine and despite best efforts availability decreases.  For
example, the consumption of spare parts for graders as percentage of the
replacement cost was estimated by the consulting firm Louis Berger Int. in
their report OMAN: Road Maintenar.ce Study, December 1976, as follows:
Year of service       1    2     3     4      5     6     7       8     9    10
Spare parts   (M)    2   2.5   3.5   4.5   6.5   8.5   12.5   14   14.5   15
Equipment Rationalization Program
4.       In the framework of 10 years highway development program the KGM
decided to rationalize the equipment fleet in order to improve road mainte-
nance and carry out the program's works. The scope of rationalization is to
scrap and replace uneconomic overaged units and acquire the balancing equip-
ment, achieving an equipment fleet corresponding to the needs of user
departments, with due regard to decreasing force account operations.

5.       The KGM equipment department had formulated in the Highway Detail
Plan 1983-1993 (March 1983) the following objectives based on equipment
maximum economic lifetime of 15 years or 15,000 hours, or 500,000 km: 1/
(a)   in 1983 scrap all self-propelled equipment of more  than 20
years; for other equipment of more than 20 years carry out
individual assessment of serviceability;
(b)   in 1984 decide on all mobile equipment and vehicles in the age
group 16-20 years;
(c)   in 1985 decide on all mobile equipment and vehicles in the age
group 11-15 years;
(d)   in 1986 evaluate all equipment in the age group 6-10 years;
(e)   purchase, as far as is economically justified, all auxiliary
equipment and principal equipment of types manufactured in
Turkey on domestic market;
(f)   streamline procurement and management of spare parts; and
(g)   ensure adequate training of all personnel.
6.       The five main user departments of KGM (Maintenance, Construction,
Asphalt, Bridge, Traffic) and general services have submitted to the Equip-
ment Department their requirements of principal equipment, based on the work
program described in the Highway Detail Plan and summarized in Appendix 1 of
this Annex. On the basis of these requirements, Equipment Department com-
piled the list of equipment which included existing equipment in working
order (under 15,000 hours or 500,000 km) and requirements of new equipment
subdivided into two groups:   equipment to be purchased by  international
competitive bidding (ICB), local competitive bidding (LCB) and equipment for
reserved local procurement, in line with the objectives stated in the Plan
(para. 5(e)). Table 2 shows the compilation of equipment; Table 3 shows the
program of international competitive bidding and local purchase. The total
estimated cost, excluding contingencies and spare parts, of ICB equipment
(minus 15 dozers 300 HP being met from Kuwait Fund) is US079.0 million,
local competitive bidding US$32 million equivalent and reserved procurement
US$32 million equivalent. The ICB and LCB equipment would be proposed for
the Bank financing under the Second Highway loan, while equipment purchased
locally, which includes about 60% of foreign exchange component, would be
financed by the Government.
1/ This maximum economic lifetime is high as compared with generally
accepted criteria but it is not contested considering Turkish financial
conditions and excellent capability of the KGM workshops.

ANNEX 1
Page 3 of 5
7.       The analysis of equipment listed in Table 2 shows the following
figures:
(a)   total  replacement  value  of  existing  principal  equipment  in
working order is US$306 million;
(b)   total  replacement  value  of  principal  equipment  after  the
proposed purchase will be US$440 million;
(c)   the  new  equipment  replacing  scrap  is  estimated  at  US$67.7
million and balancing equipment USt65.8 million; and
(d)   the replacement value of existing equipment in scrap condition
which does not require renewal is UStll6 million.
Details of scrap equipment not to be replaced are shown on Table 4.  It
should be noted that in the equipment group classified as being in working
condition are included units of the age group 11-15 years, representing
about 20% of the fleet. This equipment will be subject to decision on its
further serviceability and replacement program in 1985 (para. 5(c)). Before
such program is implemented the proposed new equipment would serve also to
replace units scrapped after 1984, during about 3 years.
8.       The KGM highway works have two principal purposes:  maintenance and
construction. Maintenance works by definition include periodic maintenance:
resealing and regravelling, while construction would include all works of
improvement of the highway network. Thus, the needs of new equipment should
be also divided in two categories: maintenance and construction equipment.
Table 3 shows subdivision of new equipment as it was requested by the user
departments.   On the basis of percentage of maintenance works in Asphalt,
Construction, Traffic and other (general services) departments (Appendix 1)
the total of maintenance equipment in the estimated cost of new equipment of
US$133.5 million would be about US$103.0 million or 77Z. In the ICB lot of
new equipment this proportion will be about 80%.
Control and Operational Requirements of KGM Fleet
9.       KGM equipment is allocated to 17 geographical regions according to
the road maintenance and construction programs of the respective region. In
each region the workshops and stores organization are under the respective
regional director for the day-to-day operations.
10.      In Ankara, the Director of Machinery Park is responsible for the
overall inventory control of the fleet and its needs plus the operation of
central stores in Ankara, Istanbul and Iskenderun, and this is the normal
type of organizational structure of Turkish Government equipment fleets. In
the case of KGM, the organization has been especially effective in achieving
high levels of utilization and availability despite the problems of an
ageing fleet and it has achieved a fairly good level of computerized static
inventory for the fleet and its central stores spare parts.



- 36 -
ANNEX 1
Page 4 of 5
11.      However, there are two important areas of management of the fleet
which need to be improved and  for which  computerized programs could be
developed as follows:
Fleet Inventory
(a)   Monthly utilization and availability of units reporting at all
levels.
(b)   Annual positive scrapping and replacement program.
(c)   Annual equipment needs program for all users of the fleet.
(d)   Monthly costing of owning, maintaining and operating the fleet
for each unit and for the fleet as a whole.
(e)   Comparisons of the relativity of hire charges against actual
costs involved.
Spare Parts Inventory
(a)   Extend the computerized control program to all regions stores.
(b)   Establish maximum and minimum stocking at all levels of stores
based on the total usage within KGM.
(c)   Revise  and check  validity  of existing  formula  for  initial
purchase of spare parts stock for new units.
12.      The computer MIS section of KGM is well developed and has ample
capacity and capability for more dynamic programs to meet these revised
requirements.   There  is, however,  a  lack of appreciation by  the middle
management of MIS, Stores and Workshops of how the existing programs and
information in the computer could be used to develop better programs and
more accurate and better management information than tf:  present manual and
static inventory systems do at present.
13.      The Bank recommends that from three to five of the top and middle
management staff involved in the stores - workshops and computer sections -
should be jointly exposed to the operations and man&a,ement of successful
private and quasi government companies such as Wimpeys, Unipart, London
Transport, and IBM for at least 10 weeks in order tco identify themselves
with successful computerized management systems and controls and on their
return they should jointly produce a working paper for the implementation of
programs which would overcome the present shortcomings of the existing
programs, particularly the Spare Parts Stock Control Programs and the Fleet
Inventory Costing and Utilization Program.

Conclusion
14.      The analysis of equipment requirements shows .h%at about 80% of the
new equipment will be used to strengthen road maintenance operations.  In
the renewed equipment fleet valued at US$440 million (para. 7), equipment
for maintenance would account for about US$350 million. There is a clear
trend towards increased emphasis on maintenance and decreased use of force
account for construction.  In 1980, about 25% of construction was carried
out by contract, in 1983 - 50% and the forecast for 1993 is 75%.  Small
contractors (taserons) are employed in ever increasing numbers. As they do
not carry sufficient equipment to undertake a full range of tasks, the KGM
rents on an increasing scale equipment for earthmoving and compaction. In a
parallel study the KGM is reviewing the equipment rental system.
15.      There is a need to develop computerized systems to control the use
of the fleet and spare parts, viz to decide on when to repair, when to
scrap, what stocks of spares should be held and what appropriate hire
charges should be to cover the cost of owning, maintaining and repairing
equipment.

STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT OF
A SECOND HIGHWAY PROJECT
KGM Equipment Needs Related to Overall Work Program
(Full Details in KGM Highway Detail Plan in Project File)
1.       The following additional justification of equipment requirements of
the Construction, Asphalt and Maintenance Departments is in amplification of
the data included in the 1983-1993 Highway Detail Plan (See Item B 11 of
Annex 13).
Construction Department
2.       The Construction Department carries out earthworks,  drainage and
base course. The equipment needs are based on the 1983-1993 program which
includes; improvement (or construction) of 6000 km of state roads, 500 km
of 4-lane highways, 5400 km of provincial roads and about 1,000 km of State
Water Works Department (DSI) and touristic roads.  These works are carried
out by contract and force account, with force account participation declin-
ing from the present 50% to 25% in 1993.
3.       In order to establish the list of required equipment the Department
used 3 methods:
(a) the volume of earthworks in various types of soils and of base
course per km was calculated on the basis of 18 completed road
projects totalling 313 km, and the appropriate equipment
required to carry out the works during the plan period was
estimated on the basis of work quantities and equipment output;
(b) it was assumed that the work will be carried out by 50 con-
struction groups of which 18 would involve transporting
ordinary soil, 16 would not require transport and 16 would
involve excavation  and  transport  of  rocks.   The  equipment
composition of each group was determined to carry out the
related works; and
(c) the above method was refined by considering 7 types of work:
average soil excavation with and without transport; similar
types of work for hard soils and rock, and construction of
base course. On the basis of estimated quantities and equip-
ment output the number of construction groups and equipment
composition of each group was computed.

ANNEX 1
Appendix 1
Page 2 of 4
4.       The lists of equipment obtained were remarkably consistent,  and
were used to establish the Construction Department equipment requirements.
The final list appears to be reasonable and acceptable.
Asphalt Department
5.       The Asphalt Department is responsible for black-top roads pavement
construction and periodic maintenance. The department carries out by force
account surface treatment, but puts to contract nearly all construction of
asphaltic premix base course, binder and wearing course carpet, including
periodic overlays. The department's traffic related 10-year program calls
for about 11,000 km of new asphaltic carpet roads and 13,400 km of new
double surface treated roads. Periodic maintenance of 36,000 km of surface
treatment roads would require a seal coat at least once every 5 years.  It
is estimated that about 80% of Asphalt Department force account output will
be for periodic maintenance. The upgrading program provides for improve-
ments to achieve the following status (in km);
1983        1993
Premix paved roads                       2,937       14,130
Bitumen surface treatment               34,670      38,030
Gravelled roads                         16,169        6,420
Earth roads 1/                           6,337          -
1/ Certain earth roads will be declassified.
6.       The Department's program includes:
(a) bitumen pavement (premix or surface treatment) on all state
roads;
(b) premix on all roads with heavy vehicles average exceeding 500
per day;
(c) bitumen pavement on more than 70Z of provincial roads;
(d) double surface treatment on shoulders of all premix paved
roads; and
(e) periodic maintenance.
Nearly all premix paving will be carried out by contract, while all surface
treatment by force account. On a phasing out basis the Department operates
8 medium size premix plants for periodic overlays and small size premix
projects.

ANNEX 1
Appedix  1
Page 3 of 4
7.       The action plan includes  force account  operation of 40  surface
treatment units, 40 base course strengthening units, 34 aggregate crushing
units, 8 premix laying units, 16 gravel screening and washing units, and 31
contract work supervision units. The Department's equipment requirement was
based on the number of working units and their composition.   It appears
realistic and acceptable.
Maintenance Department
8.       The  Maintenance  Department  carries  out  routine  maintenance  of
black-top and gravelled roads and bridges, snow clearing and emergency
repairs.  It should be noted that Maintenance Department carries out only
routine maintenance.  Periodic maintenance of black-top roads (resealing,
overlay) is the responsibility of Asphalt Department, and is financed from
the investment budget.
9.       The Maintenance Department needs are based on the necessary main-
tenance crews and their equipment. The Highway Detail Plan criteria are:
(a) one crew for 75 km of bituminous concrete pavement roads (in
1982 - 2937 km, 1993 target - 14,130 km);
Cb) one crew for 50 km of surface dressed state roads or 75 km of
provincial roads (in 1982: state roads 22,695 km, provincial
11,975  km;   1993  target;  state  roads  17630  km,  provincial
20,440 km);
Cc) one crew for 75 km of gravel roads (in 1983 - 16,169 km, 1993
target - 6,420 km);
(d) 16 crews for bridge maintenance;
(e) support equipment (graders, loaders, mobile workshops);
(f) snow clearing equipment; and
(g) personnel transport.
10.      The  total  equipment  requirements  were  estimated  for  the  1993
horizon to comprise 250 bituminous concrete pavement crews, 570 crews for
surface dressed roads, 90 for gravelled roads and 110 for bridge mainte-
nance, a total of about 1000 crews. There are currently about 600 crews in
service, which is not sufficient to ensure adequate maintenance of roads.
While efforts are made to maintain pavement surface,  road shoulders are
neglected. In order to carry out the deferred work and ensure satisfactory
maintenance, the Department considers that it should increase the number of
crews by about 100 each year to reach 1000 in 1987 or 1988.  This program is
reasonable.  The details of equipment requirements of Maintenance Department
are shown in the Highway Detail Plan.

ANNEX 1
Appendix  1
Page 4 of 4
11.      The  program  of  Traffic  Department  is  placing  and  maintaining
horizontal markings on all roads with asphaltic carpet pavement and
important surface treatment roads, highway traffic signs, traffic protecting
rails,  control of vehicle weight and highway safety measures.   In gross
approximation 80% of the department activity will be related to maintenance.
12.      Other departments' equipment needs, as can be deduced from equip-
ment list in Table 2, are related mainly to general services and administra-
tion:    flat-bed  trucks,  truck-tractors,   cranes,   personnel  transport.
Considering composition of this equipment, it could be assumed that at least
50% would pertain to maintenance, 25% to construction and 25% to general
administration.

REPUBLIC OF TURKEY
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT OF
A SECOND HIGHWAY PROJECT
Technical and Economic Criteria for Evaluating
KGM Highway Investment Projects
A. Context of Project Evaluation
1.       Proposed projects of whatever size and location will be studied in
relation to Turkey's economic and social needs and these studies will be
applied to investment planning over the entire highway program as is
required in the NTMP. Thus, in addition to conventional economic justifica-
tion on the grounds of transport cost savings and road maintenance.or recon-
struction savings, special attention will be given to;
(a)   the  contribution  traffic  makes  to  direct  foreign  exchange
earnings through, for example, transit trade;
(b)   the importance of the traffic to the export of comnodities;
5c)   transport requirements of specific economic developments;
(d)   energy saving and the development of local energy resources; and
(e)   highway safety.
Whilst some of these criteria may not always be readily quantifiable, they
should be clearly described and related to the proposed investment.
2.       Evaluation reports should also describe how the project in question
is related to both the physical and institutional objectives of the National
Transport Master Plan.  This would include, as necessary, inter-modal con-
siderations and reviews of associated investment schedules.
B. General Criteria
3.       As far as practically possible the investment program should not
include new projects with rates of return significantly lower than the test
discount rate. Where it is proposed to include projects which do not meet
economic criteria this should be clearly explained and the cost to the
economy defined. Furthermore, in these cases a range of alternative solu-
tions should be examined to identify the lowest total cost solution.
Indicators.  As far as possible projects' analyses should produce
economic rates of return, first year returns and net present value/cost



- 53 -
ANNEX 3
Page 2 of 8
ratios. However, in some cases, "lowest total transport cost" (construction
+ maintenance + operation) may be a more appropriate  indicator.   Where
alternative solutions are tested incremental cost:benefit analysis should be
undertaken using the appropriate indicator.
Test Rates.  Test rates should be established annually with the
assistance of the ministries responsible for economic planning.  Presently,
20% is used as the test rate but where it is shown that important elements,
although identified, have not been quantified either a relaxation of the
test rate may be appropriate or multi-criteria weighting may be applied. In
these exceptional cases an explanation should be given.
Project Horizons. Generally major highway projects should use 20
year horizons although 10 years is frequently acceptable.  Small projects,
especially those where significant changes may take place, should be limited
to a 10-year horizon.  Primarily the decision on time period used should be
based on an evaluation of risk and probability.
Traffic Growth Rates. Whilst average national traffic growth rates
are specified in the NTMP (4% for freight and 4.6% for passengers) these
should be assessed for each project.  Where more appropriate rates can be
justified they should be used.
C. Types of Evaluation Study
4.       Depending on the nature of the proposed project or sub-project the
study methodology will be different. Broadly three types are identified:
ca)   large complex projects or projects which may have important and
far reaching network effects, such as the proposed second
Bosphorus bridge and peripherique roads, will be subjected to
major consultancy studies based on unique terms of reference
acceptable to potential financing agencies;
(b)   important  but  relatively  straightforward  projects,  such  as
rehabilitation of parts of the Trans Turkey Highway, will be
subject to feasibility studies undertaken or supervised by KGM
staff according to the methodology and criteria described in
the next section and already used in Loan 2137-TU;
(c)   relatively small and simple projects which comprise the bulk of
the investment program will continue, for the time being to be
evaluated according to present procedures based on the RAM
model; it is expected, however, that advances in project
analysis will be incorporated as appropriate.  When projects
analyzed in this way are included in the program even though
yielding a less than normal test discount rate a note
describing the reason should be included.  In addition,  this
procedure will be applied as a general planning tool to the



- 54 -
ANNEX 3
Page 3 of 8
evaluation of the entire investment program.  Such a process
has recently been completed for the 1984-88 program; and
(d)   during  the  course  of  investment  program  and  sub-project
evaluation an analysis will be carried out of the economic and
technical effect of investment works on the cost and resource
needs for maintenance. This information will provide input for
highway maintenance planning.
D. Structure of Feasibility Studies
5.       It is to be particularly emphasized that the feasibility studies
should be the means of identifying suitable projects and specifying optimum
solutions for subsequent detailed design and implementation; they should not
merely be a medium for rubber stamping already taken technical decisions.
6.       The overall layout of the reports on 4(a) and 4(b) should be as
follows;
(a)   Introduction and Socio-Economic Context
(b)   Engineering, Specifications, Standards and Costs
(c)   Traffic Surveys, Growth Rates and Forecasts
Cd)   Vehicle Operating Costs and Benefits
Ce)   Description and Display of Costs and Benefits
(f)   Calculation of results, Sensitivity Tests and Recommendation.
Appendices
(a)   General location map (e.g. 1:500,000 map of Turkey)
Cb)   Plan of project on 1:50,000 scale
(c)   Cross sections of proposed road
(d)   Deflection survey results
(e)   Axle load survey results
(f)   Speed Survey/journey time survey results
(g)   Detailed critical path diagram of recommended solution
7.       In greater detail the sections should include but not be limited to:
(A) Introduction and Economic Context
-   brief  summary  of  the  project  including  details  of  any
associated investments and administrative arrangements;
-   description of project location, terrain and climate;
-   population and settlements served by the road;
-   economic activity of the area through which the road passes
(i.e. its immediate area of influence) and a quantified
assessment of its importance to the national economy;

importance, quantified as far as possible, to the country; .arti
-   the relationship of the proposed project to the overall  .iglhway
plan and strategy and NTMP.
(B) Engineering Specifications, Standards and Costs
(a)   These should be given separately for homogeneous sections in

alternative solutions including a special evaluation of the
system and cost of the maintenance alternative.

Details of bridges and major structures should also be given and any .3pecial
problems should be described.
(b)   The road condition categories should be described as given for
"good", "fair", "bad", and "very bad" in Appendix 1.  However,
where considered appropriate, sub-categories may be identified
and the equivalent vehicle operating costs interpolated: it is
proposed to investigate the use eventually of more sophisti-
cated methodologies such as the World Bank's HDM model or the
Transport and Road Research Laboratory's RTIM II model. In the
same section information of road deterioration and maintenance
should also be discussed. With respect to these latter, if the
road is in the "very bad" category assume no further deteriora-
tion during the 10-year analysis period;
-   if  the road  is  in  the "bad"  category,  assume  that  it
deteriorates to "very bad" after 5 years;
-   if the road is in the "fair" category or "very good"/"good"
but inadequately designed for the traffic assume that it
deteriorates at a rate equivalent to a rise of 6% p.a. in
vehicle operating costs or until the "very bad" category is
reached;
-   for adequately designed new or rehabilitated roads with
appropriate maintenance assume a rate of deterioration
equivalent to 2% p.a. rise in vehicle operating costs;
-   concerning maintenance, if the road is below the appro-
priate construction standard and with more than 250,000
equivalent standard axles p.a. assume that the cost



- 57 -
ANNEX 3
Page 6 of 8
of routine and periodic maintenance is twice the normal
level and that at more than 500,000 equivalent standard
axles p.a. the cost of routine and periodic maintenance is
three times the normal level; the cost at intervening
levels should be interpolated.
(c)   Construction costs should be provided section by section and in
total (also major structures separately where appropriate)
including and excluding tax and calculating the estimated
foreign cost component.  This should be done for all alterna-
tive solutions.
(d)   An outline critical path diagram should be provided for each
alternative solution showing the activities and their durations
leading to contract award(s) and mobilization; and also stating
the contract period.
(e)   A semi-annual cash flow for construction payments against the
budget, drawn up from past experience on similar project and
from other data.
C. Traffic Surveys, Growth Rates and Forecasts
Ca)   Results of up-to-date classified vehicle counts differentiating
between Turkish and non-Turkish vehicles should be given and
also the results of origin and destination surveys where alter-
native routes are being examined. Based on these, AADT traffic
should be estimated.
(b)   Results of up-to-date axle load surveys differentiating between
directions ot travel.
(c)   Growth  ratec  for volumes  and  weight  of  traffic  should  be
estimated by category of traffic and these should be justified
according to economic and social parameters.
(d)   Forecasts of traffic for the analysis period should be given by
number of vehicle type (differentiating between Turkish and
non-Turkish vehicles) and by number of standard axles p.a.; and
when necessary adjustments should be made for the effect of
special events on traffic (e.g. the adjustment made in base
year traffic to allow for a possible reduction in the high
level of Iraq transit traffic) generated traffic should be
identified separately.
(e)   A description of major commodities carried should be given.

ANNEX 3
Page 7 of 8
D.   Vehicle Operating Costs and benefits
(a)   The base vehicle operating  costs  free of  tax calculated  in
May/June 1983 should be used suitably updated as free of tax
unit prices change (but also see HDM III and RTIM II calcula-
tions of vehicle operating costs).
(b)   Vehicle speeds/journey time tables should be included.
(c)   Continue using the existing road  condition category  coeffi-
cients applying to Very Good, Good, Fair, Bad and Very Bad
conditions (unless sub-categories are considered to be more
appropriate).
(d)   Vehicle operating cost  savings derived  by generated  traffic
should be multiplied by a factor of 0.5 and those derived by
non-Turkish vehicles should be excluded from the analysis.
(e)   A special section should be included describing the impact of
the project on fuel consumption and foreign exchange earnings.
(f)   Road maintenance savings should be calculated and compared with
vehicle operating cost savings.
(g)   Where considered appropriate additional savings such as value
of time and accident prevention may be included but these
inclusions should be explained and justified.
(h)   Any other benefits  (agricultural  exports,  greater port effi-
ciency etc.) should be described but care taken to avoid double
counting of the generated traffic.
E.   Description and Display of Costs and Benefits
(a)   The discount rate or cut-off rate should be specified (20% at
present).
(b)   Tables clearly showing discounted and undiscounted  costs and
benefits should be given in respect of all alternative solu-
tions examined: an example is given in the Annex. Maintenance
benefits should also be stated as a percentage of benefits
excluding value of time savings.
(c)   In cases where value of time (VOT) savings are included (apart
from salaried vehicle crew cost savings) the benefits should be
given with and without VOT benefits.

ANNEX 3
Page 8 of 8
F.   Calculation of Results, Sensitivity Tests and Recommendations
(a)   Internal Rates of Return (IRR), Net Present Value (NPV)/Cost
Ratio, First Year Rates of Return (FYR) and Benefit Cost Ratios
(BCR) should be calculated for each alternative solution
invescigated and set out as follows:
Solution A         Solution B
NPV/Cost
BCR
FYR
IRR
(b)   A description should be  given of the major  risks  (if any)
facing the project - for example, increases in construction
cost or period, declines in traffic growth estimates or failure
to achieve associated projects such as port expansion.  Once
such risks are defined the probability of their reaching
certain values should be assessed and, if the probability is
considered sufficiently high, the appropriate values should be
applied to the calculations to assess the impact on them. For
example,
Solution A     Solution B
Increase in construction cost due
to encountering hard rock + x%            IRR =           IRR =
Decrease in benefits due to over-
estimation of traffic growth
rates - Y%                                IRR =           IRR =
Increase in construction costs
+ x% and decrease in benefits - y%        IRR =           IRR =
(c)    Following the calculation off results, examination of risk and
tests for sensitivity a recommendation as to the preferred
solution should be made.   Apart  from  a necessity  to meet
minimum economic criteria (NPV positive and BCR > 1.0 when
discounted at 20%, IRR and FYR v 20%) this recommendation may
take into account a number of other factors and these should
be explained in justification of the decision. For example, a
solution with a low rate of return but virtually riskless
solution may be preferred to a high rate of return high risk
solution, or a solution may be given added importance because
of its links with economic activity in other sectors or
because of foreign exchange earning potential.
(d)    Once the final recommendation has been made a detailed criti-
cal path diagram for implementation should be drawn and
included in the feasibility study annexes.

earlier in 1974 with the Gebze experimental road section, the KGM initiated
pavement research, with a view to improving and refining their pavement
design methods. In the course of carrying out this research and in develop-
ing a planning system for the appropriate maintenance and investments of the
State and Provincial highway network, it is desirable to expand upon the
existing  program.   The draft KGM  report  (December  1983)  on  the Ankara
experimental project will be implemented and expanded upon in accordance
with the following terms of reference. Complementary studies will be under-
taken in continuance of the ongoing economic evaluation of the appropriate
balance between highway maintenance, rehabilitation and strengthening.
II. OBJECTIVES
2.       The objectives of the pavement research programs are;
Ca)   to review KGM's current design  and maintenance  methods  and
revise them where advisable:   this method will also be cost
analyzed;
(b)   to review and experiment with the use of construction materials
to enable the most economic pavement structures to be used for
Turkish conditions;
(c)   to survey pavement performance on selected existing roads in
relation to design standards, maintenance programs and traffic,
so as to produce an early evaluation (in about 2 years) of
existing   pavement   design,    construction   materials   and
maintenance methods and levels;
(d)   to undertake,  initially on a sample basis,  an analysis  and
evaluation of the appropriate balance between the maintenance
program and the rehabilitation and investment program; and

(e) to develop gradually a pavement planning system for the State
and Provincial road network, that will enable timely action to
be taken to maintain upgrade and preserve pavements.
III. SCOPE OF THE ?ROGRAMS
3.       The program of research will be designed so as to carry out the
field work upon which assessments can be made of appropriate design
standards and the use of construction materials.
4.       In particular the programs will include the following:
(a) the design, planning, construction, instrumentation, and moni-
toring of an experimental section near Ankara and later three
other sections in the Mersin, Erzurum and Diyarbakir regions
(one experimental section already exists near Istanbul);
(b) field measurements 1/ of selected existing road sections repre-
senting the five major climatic regions of Turkey, a range of
traffic,  pavement conditions  and paved  surface  types.   These
measurements, together with the evaluation of associated mainte-
nance routine, would be carried out on a continuing basis;
(c) continued measurement on the selected roads of maintenance
activities and their results on vehicle operating costs and
pavement condition; a detailed analysis of maintenance and other
costs shall also be undertaken for each section;
(d) review and analysis (say in 2 years) of the results of the con-
tinuing survey on selected roads to evaluate existing pavement
designs, construction methods and materials, and maintenance,
and thereafter, (say in 5 years) use the resu'lts of pavement
deterioration with pavement management models to gradually
introduce a Pavement Management System for Turkey; and
(e) reviews and analyses of data collected from the five experimen-
tal sections (say over 5 to 8 years) to determine together with
the results of the continuous survey on selected roads, what
revised designs should be adopted and to make recommendations on
the use of improved construction materials and techniques for
pavements: these studies will include the evaluation of design,
construction and materials and comparison of these with the
costs of different levels of maintenance and vehicle operating
costs.
1/ Including condition survey (cracking, rut depth, ravelling, etc.); road
roughness, deflection, cone penetrometer, falling weight deflectometer,
traffic volume and axle load surveys, and subgrade moisture conditions.

5.       The Research Department of KGM will set up a task force responsible
for these programs and will carry out the programs in conjunction with field
services from the Divisions and other headquarters Departments of KGM.  To
assist in carrying out the programs, KGM may hire consultants from time to
time. 1/
IV. TIME SCHFDULE AND REPORTS
6.       These are long term programs with complete results not expected
within 7 or 8 years though useful information can be expected within 2 or 3
years.  Based upon such a time frame, the following schedule of works is
suggested:
1984:    Construct   Ankara   experimental   section,   including   monitoring
arrangements and instrumentation, select existing roads for data
survey, and monitor Gebze experiment.
1985:    Monitor those experiments already constructed and carry out first
year's full survey on selected roads.
1986:    Monitor  all  experimental  sections  and  carry  out  second  year's
survey on selected roads.
1987:    Analyze and review data from all experimental sections and selected
roads and continue monitoring and  surveys.   Prepare  preliminary
recommendations on pavement designs, construction materials and
techniques and on a pavement management system - this would include
the necessary computer hardware and software applications and needs.
1988-90:   Continue  monitoring and surveys,  and  prepare  revised  pavement
design methodology, recommendatiot-s on use of materials and make
detail recommendations for implementing a pavement management
system.
1990-92; Implement the new design and maintenance methods and procedures.
7.       KGM will prepare annual reports by December 31, each year starting
in 1984 recording progress and results of the pavement research program for
that year and also showing the works planned for the forthcoming year. The
reports will be prepared in Turkish and in English (the World Bank will
undertake translation if necessary) and will be jointly reviewed by KGM and
the Bank.
1/  KGM has indicated in its draft report on the Ankara experimental section
that it would appreciate expert services from the TRRL to assist in the
planning, design, instrumentation and training of KGM staff in monitor-
ing the Ankara experimental  section.   This would be  the subject of
separate terms of reference between TRRL and KG?.

V. STAFFING AND FACILITIES TO BE PROVIDED
FOR THE PROGRAMS
8.           The KGM will provide staff to carry out the program and these
will include:
(a)   A Program Manager
(b)   An Assistant Manager (experimental sections)
(c)   An Assistant Manager (traffic and vehicle operating costs)
for whom terms of reference will be prepared. Engineers will be appointed.
within the Research Department, other KGM headquarters Departments and the
Divisions to be responsible for components of the programs as necessary.
9.       The KGM  will  construct  all  experimental  sections  and  provide
instruments and vehicles for research staff and will arrange for consultancy
services and training of their staff.   Specific  items of equipment and
vehicles and consultancy services may be provided under the Bank Second

REPUBLIC OF TURKEY
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT OF
A SECOND HIGHWAY PROJECT
Procurement Procedures
Introduction
1.       The Turkish procurement system provides  adequately for efficient
and economic procurement.   It is governed by the Law 2886 published  in
Official Gazette on September 10, 1983, which replaced with the effect of
January 1, 1984, the Law 2490 of 1979. A copy of the Law 2886 in Turkish
and a free English translation is in the Project File (Annex 13).
2.       The Highway Department system of bidding for civil works, for both
LCB and ICB, consists in requiring contractors to bid on priced bill of
quantities and comparing the overall discount offered.  The competition in
highway construction is keen and prices obtained are generally low.  Bids
for both LCB and ICB on civil works and on supply contracts are opened in
the presence of the Bidders. No alterations of bid prices are allowed after
bid  opening.   Negotiations  with  the  bidders  are  not  allowed;  if bids
received are not responsive, new bids are called.
Civil Works (US$106 million equivalent)
3.       Civil works on highway rehabilitation will be procured under ICB
for major paving contracts and under LCB for smaller paving and advance work
contracts.   Advanced  contracts  include  such  works  as  bridges,  culvert
extensions, widening through villages, short deviations, supply and stock
piling of pavement aggregates and the preparation of camps and work sites.
These works are, by their nature, relatively small and it is necessary to
keep the contracts small and spaced out over time not only because of their
nature, but also because of difficulties with traffic control on larger
contracts.
4.       It is expected that about ten ICB paving contracts will be let for
road lengths varying between 40 km and 110 km each, and with estimated costs
ranging between US$3 million and US$15 million  equivalent  each.   Small
paving contracts, less than US$3 million equivalent, and within an aggregate
ceiling of US$9 million equivalent including contingencies, may be let under
LCB procedures acceptable to the Bank and open to foreign bidders.
5.       It is expected that about 75 LCB advance contracts will be awarded
each not exceeding US$3 million equivalent, five of which will be between
USSI-3 million and the remaining 70 will average about US$100,000 equivalent
each.   The aggregate ceiling for LCB advance contracts  is US$18 million
equivalent.

ANNEX 11
Page 2 of 3
International Competitive Bidding
6.       Prequalification on an annual basis is required by Turkish regula-
tions  for contracts  to be awarded  under  ICB.   Suitably  qualified  local
contractors will be invited to participate in prequalification.  ICB bidding
and prequalification procedures are adequate.  Contracts are awarded to the
lowest evaluated bid, and firms are prequalified on the basis of their past
experience, financial and management capacity and availability of equipment
and staff.  Foreign firms are encouraged to form joint ventures with local
firms in any degree of joint participation they propose.
7.       KGM is authorized to call international bids for construction of
certain roads,  bridges and tunnels on the basis of Law  7054,  published
September 13, l157.  Under this Law the Ministry of Public Works makes the
request through the Ministry of Finance to the Council of Ministers, which
issues an appropriate Decree.  A copy of the Law 7054 and the Decree 8/848
of May 1980 showing its application to the Trans-Turkey Highway and other
important roads is in the Project File (Annex 13).
Local Competitive Bidding
8.       Participation  in  the  bidding  is  open  to  registered,  qualified
contractors. There is no restriction on participation of foreign bidders,
although payments are normally  in  local  currency.   However,  for special
cases, which require the Council of Ministers approval, bids are invited
from the prequalified foreign and local specialized firms and payments in
foreign currency are allowed to foreign contractors (para. 7).  Calls for
bids are advertised in local newspapers and for large contracts in the
official Gazette. Contract conditions are fair for contractors and payment
arrangements are satisfactory. Settlement of disputes is in local courts.
9.       Contracts are awarded in principle to the lowest evaluated bid.
However, the Law 2886 allows selection of the most advantageous bid in
preference to the lowest bid,if the lowest bidder; (i) is over extended;
(ii) has failed to complete or performed unsatisfactorily on previous
contracts;  (iii)  lacks  required  expertise;  and  (iv)  has  insufficient
resources to undertake the work.
Equipment and Spares
10.      About thirty contracts to be financed by the Bank for equipment,
and spare parts, estimated to cost USS92 million, will be awarded following
international competitive bidding in which local suppliers will be invited
to participate, and about fifty contracts, estimated to cost about
US$32 million, are expected to be awarded under local competitive bidding
open to foreign bidders. ICB equipment and spares contracts are expected to
range from about UStloo,o00 to US$12 million each and LCB contracts from
US$20,000 to US$3 million each. The LCB contracts will be let on the basis
of competitive bidding advertized locally in accordance with procedures
satisfactory to the Bank, in which foreign firms would be permitted to bid.



- 78 -
ANNEX I 1
Page 3 of 3
Under Bank financed contracts subject to ICB,  locally manufactured  goods
will be allowed a margin of preference of 15% or actual  customs  duty,
whichever is the lower.  All bids will be evaluated on the basis of cost,
delivery period, standardization, spare parts costs and subsequent dealer
service.
11.      Contracts for goods estimated to cost the equivalent of US$20,000
or less each and in the aggregate not exceeding the equivalent of
US$800,000, may be procured on the basis of local shopping, in accordance
with procedures satisfactory to the Bank.
Consultant Services and Training
12.      Consultants services will be provided by qualified and experienced
consultants, either domestic or foreign, or in joint ventures, and in
accordance with terms and conditions  satisfactory to the Bank.   Training
fellowships proposed by the Government will be reviewed in advance by the
Bank.
Bank Review Procedures
13.      All  contracts  for  civil  works  being  financed  under  Bank  loan
components and which are estimated to cost more than $5 million equivalent
each, and contracts for equipment over $750,000 equivalent each, would be
subject to the Bank's prior review of procurement documentation. All other
contracts being financed by the Bank will be subject to selective post-award
reviews. All fellowships and consultancy contracts will be reviewed by the
Bank as they are proposed by the Government.
