SECOND HIGHWAY PROJECT
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower:         Republic of Turkey
Amount:           US$186.4 million (including capitalized front-end fee)
Terms:            Seventeen years including four years of grace, with
standard variable interest rate
Project Objectives
and Description:
The proposed project would consist of components selected
from 1985-88 investment program of the General Directorate
of Highways (KGM). The loan would provide financing for:
(a) highway civil viorks; (b) procurement of equipment for
investment and maintenance works; and (c) consultancy
services and training. The project is designed to assist
KGM in the following areas: (i) project planning,
preparation and implementation; (ii) development of a
modern and more balanced equipment fleet for its investment
and maintenance works; (iii) pavements research and
management; and (iv) staff training and highway safety.
Benefits and
Risks:            The project would lead to savings in transport and highway
maintenance costs and would promote highway safety.
Savings would accrue especially on quick benefit yielding
routes, which also generate foreign exchange earnings
because of transit and export traffic. There are no
unusual technical risks. The principal risk is that a need
to reduce budgetary outlays could reduce funds available
for financing the project.  The annual review of budget
adequacy would give the Bank an early opportunity to assess
this financing risk which, though it might affect the KGM's
investment program as a whole, would not necessarily affect
the Bank-financed project. There is also a risk that
transport demand might be below projected levels
particularly in the case of transit traffic. However, risk
analysis indicates that the subprojects expected to be
financed by the Bank would remain economic, even if
transport demands were substantially below cturrent
expectations.

INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE IBRD
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
THE REPUBLIC OF TURKEY
FOR A SECOND HIGHWAY PROJECT
1.       I submit the following reporl: and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Republic of Turkey for the equivalent of US$186.4 million to help
finance selected components of the 1985-88 investment program of the General
Directorate of Highways (KGM). The loan would have a term of 17 years
including four years of grace, with interest at the prevailing rate.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.       An economic mission visited Turkey in June 1982, and its report
entitled "Turkey-. Country Economic Memorandum, Recent Economic Developments
and Medium-Term Prospects" (No. 4287-TU) was distributed to the Executive
Directors in June 1983. The report, in addition to analyzing Turkey's
medium-term prospects and overall creditworthiness, presents a synthesis of
earlier special economic reports on aspects of Turkey's adjustment process.
The report of the mission to review the financial system, entitled: "Turkey:
Special Economic Report - Policies for the Financial Sector" (No. 4459-TU),
was distributed in September 1983. An economic mission visited Turkey in
January 1984 to review the economic developments of 1983, the 1984 Annual
Program and selected structural adjustment issues. The findings of this
mission are reflected in this section.
3.       Turkey is about as large as France and Germany combined, with a
population of around 46 million and an estimated GNP per capita of $1370 in
1982. The density of population is low (78 per square kilometer of
agricultural land), and about 45 percent live in urban centers. Population
growth (2.2 percent per annum) is below the median for middle-income
countries. Despite rapid economic growth in the mid-1970s as well as
substantial emigration of workers (to Western Europe and more recently, to the
Middle East), the employment situation has deteriorated steadily with an
unemployment rate currently estimated at about 18 percent. There is, however,
little or no absolute poverty, although income distribution is skewed. There
are considerable regional differences in income and large rural-urban
disparities. Recent data indicate a probable worsening in income
distribution, especially of wage and salary earners, and a sharp real decline
in average earnings.  Educational enrollments have expanded greatly but the
level of adult literacy remains relatively low.

Background
4.       During the 1970s Turkey did not make the necessary adjustments to the
shocks caused by the steep rise in oil prices, stagflation in the OECD
economies, and the consequent deterioration in the terms of external trade.
Until 1977 Turkey maintained high rates of economic growth by raising the
share of investment in GDP. This was financed initially by workers'
remittances and, following the quadrupling of oil prices, increasingly by
short-term borrowing. The rapid GNP growth came to an abrupt halt in 1977 as
the massive external debt burden led to a sharp deterioration in
creditworthiness, severe shortages of imports, and disruptions in industrial
production with a rise in unemployment. By the end of 1979, domestic
inflation had also become an issue of critical importance.
5.       The Turkish authorities' response to the crisis of the late 1970s was
a major shift in development strategy in 1980, moving towards outward
orientation and giving an increased role to market forces. Policies were
adopted to expand exports and increase workers' remittances which, together
with liberalization of imports, encouragement of foreign investment and
prudent external debt management, were aimed at alleviating the balance of
payments constraint and import shortages.  On the domestic front, the
objectives were a reduction in the inflation rate, reform of the State
Economic Enterprises (SEEs), a more efficient financial sector, improved
resource mobilization and better selection of investments, especially in the
public sector.
6.       The adjustment program, which has been supported by the Bank through
four structural adjustment loans so far, involves far-reaching changes in
attitudes, institutions, and the legal and policy framework, all of which take
time and are difficult to put in place. In view of the severity of the crisis
in 1979, and the urgent need to bring down inflation and stabilize the balance
of payments as quickly as possible, the Government accepted the need for a
temporary sacrifice of growth and social objectives. Major structural changes
were made in the operation of the exchange rate regime, the tax system,
interest rate policy, export strategy, the SEE sector and public investment
policy.
7.       The implementation of the program was carried out under a military
regime which assumed power in September ;!980 following a period of sustained
unrest.  Subsequently a Consultative Assembly was set up to draft a new
constitution, which was overwhelmingly endorsed in a nationwide referendum in
November 1982. New election and party laws were then promulgated, and
parliamentary elections completed in November 1983. A new Government assumed
office in December 1983.
The Structural Adjustment Process -- 1980-83
8.       The Turkish economy has shown an impressive response to the
structural adjustment program and actual performance met or exceeded the
Government's own targets through 1982. By contrast, results in 1983 proved to



- 3 -
be mixed, due in part to adverse economic developments on the external front,
slippages in the monetary program, and Government inertia in the face of
upcoming elections.
9.       Real GNP, after falling for two consecutive years, expanded by
4.2 percent in 1981 and 4.6 percent in 1982. Growth was mainly export-led,
with less than one-quarter of the grDwth in 1982 due to domestic demand.
Demand for consumption increased by 3 percent while fixed investment grew at a
modest 4.1 percent (both in real terms) in 1982, and depletion of inventories
helped to expand supply. Public investment grew at a slower rate than private
investment, thus reversing the trend of previous years. However, unemployment
continued to grow as employment opportunities did not increase fast enough to
absorb the expansion of the labor force. GNP growth slowed down in 1983 to
about 3.2 percent as against the target of 4.8 percent, due in large part to
the effect of adverse weather conditions on agricultural production.
Industrial value added is estimated to have registered a growth of 6.6 percent
as against the program target of 5.5 percent. Total fixed investment
increased by about 4.2 percent. As in the previous two years, private fixed
investment grew faster than public fixed investment (5.7 percent versus
3.2 percent).
10.      The Government has been remarkably successful in reducing the rate of
inflation through a combination of fiscal, monetary and income policies,
although the downward trend was reversed in 1983.  After peaking at
107 percent in 1980, the annual average rate of increase in the wholesale
price index declined to 37 percent in 1981, and around 25 percent in 1982,
which was the program target.  In 1983, it rose to 31.4 percent, as against
the program target of 20 percent. The rise was fueled by an expansion of
Central Bank credits to firms and commercial banks in difficulty during the
second half of 1983. The resulting liquidity expansion, in conjunction with a
lowering of nominal deposit interest rates, encouraged consumption at the
expense of savings (consumption increased by 4.2 percent).
I1.      Commercial bank interest rates which were deregulated in July 1980
have increased substantially and are now markedly positive in real terms. As
a result, total bank deposits increased by 72 percent in 1980 over 1979, and
in 1981 this trend accelerated, with total deposits growing by 104 percent and
time deposits by 263 percent. Growth in deposits slowed somewhat in 1982 and
1983. The bankruptcy in late June 1982 of a major non-bank financial
institution shook depositor confidence and was followed by a shift of funds
into the larger banks. The Government averted an immediate crisis in the
banking sector and undertook actions to reform and strengthen the financial
sector as a whole. A new banking law was enacted in June 1983. It covered
many of the recommendations made by the Bank's report on the financial
sector 1/. including measures to reduce the undercapitlization of banks, place
limits on the real assets and investments of banks, link the establishment of
branches to the level of a bank's equity, reduce the interlocking between
banks and corporations, introduce a deposit insurance scheme and increase the
role of the Central Bank in the supervision of the banking sector. The
Government also took a major step towards reducing the cost of intermediation
1/ "Turkey; Special Economic Report - Policies for the Financial Sector"
(No. 4459-TU), dated September 21, 1983.



- 4 -
and strengthening the inter-bank market by reducing the level of the financial
transactions tax from 15 percent to 3 percent in December 1983. Separately,
the Government has reduced the level of withholding tax applicable to interest
payments on deposits and bonds from 20 percent to 10 percent.
12.      While positive real interest rates have provided an incentive to
save, they have also meant high borrowing costs. The current real interest
rate for non-preferential credits is about 30 percent, and there is
considerable disparity between the cost of preferential and non-preferential
credits. The high interest rates, together with the limited availability of
credit, have led to considerable liquidity problems for the private business
sector, particularly for businesses supplying the domestic market. In order
to reduce real interest rates, measures are also needed to lower the operating
costs of banks which are well above prevailing levels in comparable countries,
in addition to a reduction in the inflation rate.
13.      In the fiscal area the most notable feature is a marked retrenchment
of the public sector. The budget deficit to GNP ratio, which stood at
4.6 percent in 1980, decreased to 1.2 percent in 1982, while SEE transfers as
a percentage of GNP showed a steady decline from 4.8 percent in 1980 to
2.8 percent in 1982. The public sector accounts continued to show improvement
in 1983. Although there was a shortfall in tax revenues, this was more than
offset by savings in expenditure, so that the ratio of budgetary deficit to
GNP further declined to about 0.5 percent. Transfers to SEEs as a percentage
of GNP also registered a decline to 2.6 percent in 1983. However, total
profits of SEEs at TL 52 billion were somewhat lower than expected, implying a
slight increase in the ratio of the SEE financing requirement to GNP.
14.      On the external account, the flexible exchange rate policy under
which the Turkish lira has been adjusted daily since May 1981, together with
stagnation in domestic demand and a booming Middle East market have all
contributed to an unprecedented export growth in 1981 to $4.7 billion, or
63 percent higher in doLlar terms than the 1980 level. The increases were
concentrated in manufactured goods (a rise of nearly 120 percent). Product
groups with the largest increases included textiles, clothing, cement, iron
and steel, and non-electrical equipment. Exports in 1982 reached
$5.75 billion, about 22 percent above 1981, despite a significant decline in
export prices, particularly for agricultural products. Manufactured exports
were the major source of expansion, as exporters continued to develop markets
in the Middle East. In 1983, exports grew by about 11 percent in volume but
their value was slightly lower compared with 1982 at $5.7 billion, because of
a sharp downward movement in export prices.
15.      A new and rapidly growing source of foreign exchange is income earned
from construction contracts in the Middle East and North African countries
(with a gross value of around $12 billion in 1983). These activities are
expected to add to the normal flow of workers' remittances, which remained
strong throughout 1981 but declined in 1982 and 1983, reflecting the
appreciation of the US dollar vis-a-vis European currencies as well as the
impact of the recession in Western Europe.
16.      The shortfall in earnings from exports and workers' remittances in
1983 was partially offset by a less-than-expected increase in the value of
imports, which reached $9.0 billion as compared to the programmed level of
$9.7 billion. The net result was a substantial increase in the current
account deficit to $2.0 billion in 1983 (3.5 percent of GNP) as against
$1.1 billion in 1982 (2.0 percent of GNP).

The New Economic Program
17.      The new Government announced its economic program in December 1983.
The major structural measures are in line with the objectives contained in the
1980 reform program. Export growth and inflation control remain central to
the new program. The measures include:
(i)    a reorganization of the Government's administrative machinery
which, inter alia, concentrates authority over economic affairs
in the Prime Minister's office;
(ii)    a substantial import liberalization;
(iii)    a rationalization of export incentives;
(iv)    a liberalization of the foreign exchange regime;
(v)    an interest rate policy designed to provide a real rate of
return on savings while largely freeing lending rates set by the
commercial banks;
(vi)    a reduction in the financial transactions tax and the
withholding tax on interest payments; and
(vii)    a reaffirmation that with some exceptions, SEEs will be free to
set their own prices..
Medium-term Prospects
18.      The Government's draft Fifth Five-Year Development Plan (1985-89) is
expected to be submitted to the Grand National Assembly in the Fall of 1984.
The Government has announced its intention of preparing a Plan that is
consistent with the aims of the continuing structural adjustment process, and
has indicated its line of thinking on some of the key targets for the Plan:
(i)    the average annual real rate of growth of merchandise exports is
projected to be in the 8-11 percent range;
(ii)    the Government's intention is to restore an approximate balance
between public and private investment in the medium-term; given
the public/private balance of about 60:40 in 1983, this implies
a growth rate for private fixed investment which is tore than
double that of public fixed investment over the Plan period;
(iii)    under the above assumptions, and with reasonable expectations
regarding external capital flows, the Government's target
average annual GNP growth rate for the Plan period will be about
6 percent; and
(iv)    the Government will not allow a situation in which the targeted
growth rate of GNP will need to be supported by annual gross
external capital requirements which would push the debt service
ratio significantly above 25 percent.



-6-
19.      The Bank's projections for the medium-term take as their starting
point the Government's own targets for the key macroeconomic variables. The
Bank attempted to disaggregate the Government's overall targets for the Plan
and to check whether these were in line with domestic and foreign resources.
The Bank's projections indicate the need for a continuation of the
stabilization program well into 1986, an average annual GDP growth of
5.8 percent in 1985-89 and a manageable balanTce of payments. Two central
assumptions underpin these projections, namely export sustainability and
fiscal discipline. Table I below presents the Bank's projections of the key
economic variables for the Fifth Plan period (1985-1989).

20,      These projections assume that the 1984 program for export growth will
be achieved, so that in the base year of the Plan merchandise exports will
stand at $6.8 billion. 1/  Merchandise exports are projected to grow at an
average of 9 percent per annum in real terms, i.e. slightly on the
conservative side of the Government's 8-11 percent target range. Merchandise
imports, on the other hand, should grow moderately in real terms through 1986
and then pick up to an average 8-9 percent in the terminal years of the Plan,
to match the projected growth rate of merchandise exports. On these
assumptions, the current account balance shows a decreasing deficit through
1985 as stabilization policies act to curtail import growth while encouraging
exports.  As higher growth rates set in during the middle of the Plan period,
the trend reverses and the current account deficit rises again through the end
of the Plan, The terminal year 1989 would sholw a deficit of approximately
IL/ Merchandise exports during the first two months of 1984 totalled
$1,142 million, representing an increase oE 29.5 percent in dollar terms
over the level achieved during the corresponding period in 1983.



$2.5 billion as compared to a 1985 figure of $1.1 billion. The projected
capital account would remain manageable throughout the projection period even
in the face of some sharp increases in the amortization and interest payments
in 1985-1986 arising from the debts rescheduled during the 1978-1982 period,
and the imposed constraint on foreigni exchange reserves being equivalent to at
least two months' imports. The debt service ratio would average 23.8 percent
for the Plan period with a maximum o: 24.5 percent in 1986. Gross capital
inflows required to support Turkey in 1985-1989, on these assumptions, would
average about $4.0 billion per year, or one-third more than the amount in the
base year of the Plan. This inflow is consistent with a decreasing debt
service ratio from 1986 onwards.
21.      The projections indicate a GDP growth of 5.8 percent per annum on
average throughout the Plan period, with a low of 4.9 percent in the initial
year of the Plan and a high of 6.5 percent for the final year. The
achievement of these growth rates will depend on the growth of the productive
sectors, namely agriculture and manufacturing. This in turn will depend to a
large extent on the Government's determination to constrain the growth of the
public sector in line with public resources and to create a more favorable
investment climate for the private sector through its anti-inflationary
policies and its restructuring efforts.
22.      The scenario assumes progressive improvements in the public/private
fixed investment ratio throughout the Plan period, from the initial 59.41
ratio in 1984 to a terminal year ratio of 53.47. This translates into
projected real growth per annum in public fixed investment of about
4.7 percent. The comparable figure for private fixed investment is
9.6 percent, or a little more than twice the growth rate for public
investment.
23.      The medium-term scenario described here is of course, only one of
many possibilities and is used in this report to illustrate Turkey's potential
in the light of the Government's own targets. The Bank projections are
consistent with the more conservative of the Government's targets and are
considered realistic, given Turkey's record of structural adjustment, the
favorable responses from the international financial community to the new
Government's program and the present view of future resources and export
market possibilities. A scenario compatible with the upper ranges of the
Government's key targets would need to be supported by substantially higher
export growth rates that would be more difficult to realize, given the
transitional (stabilization-cum-growth) nature of the upcoming Plan.
24.      There are certain risks associated with achieving the Government's
targets. On the downside, with Turkey's export performance heavily dependent
on exogenous factors such as the world economic outlook and movements in
international prices, a slower growth of merchandise exports, say 6-7 percent
over the Plan period, would lead to a more difficult (but still manageable)
balance of payments situation, more external borrowing, a lower GDP growth
(averaging about 4.5 percent per annum) and a higher debt service ratio
(26-27 percent per annum). In such a situation the Government would have
little chance of absorbing the unemployed and improving tangibly the average
standard of living. However, given the Government's emphasis on export
promotion and the determined efforts to counter the bias towards producing for
the domestic market, the perspective set out in the medium-term scenario
presented above, would represent a balanced goal.

External Debt and Creditworthiness
25.      At the end of 1978, Turkey had $7.5 billion in short-term debt and
$6.8 billion in medium- and long-term debt. Service payment obligations
(mostly on short-term debt) were $5.1 billion (including arrears), or nearly
three times the value of merchandise exports in 1977. Between 1978 and 1980,
Turkey rescheduled some $9.2 billion of outstanding obligations through a
series of rescheduling arrangements concluded with official and commercial
creditors. Approximately $6.0 billion of short-term debt, including
$2.6 billion in convertible Turkish lira deposits and bankers credits and
$1.2 billion of non-guaranteed suppliers credits, were consolidated into
medium-term loans or partially converted into Turkish lira obligations.
Following the resolution of the debt crisis, inflows were mostly from official
sources -- major creditors being the OECD countries, the World Bank and the
IMF. Of the total debt outstanding of $18.6 billion at end-1982, 81 percent
constituted medium- and long-term debt. Short-term debt as a percentage of
total debt outstanding fell from 51 percent in 1978 to 11 percent in 1982.
Based on the growth scenario outlined earlier, debt outstanding and disbursed
as a percentage of GDP is projected to fall from 38 percent in 1983 to
30 percent in 1989.
26.      The debt service ratio increased from about 14 percent in 1981 to
27.2 percent in 1983 as a result of a large repayment of previously
rescheduled debt under the earlier OECD agreements. Debt service (interest
and amortization) obligations are likely to be high over the coming years and
would average about $4 billion per year in 1985-89. On the assumption that
the average annual gross capital inflows during the period 1985-89 will be on
the order of $4 billion, the projections beyond 1984 show a debt service ratio
of 24.7 percent in 1985 and 22.6 percent in 1989. The debt burden should
remain manageable provided current policies are successfully implemented, the
export drive is sustained and Turkey continues to receive further support from
international commercial and official sources. There are some recent
encouraging signs of Turkey's ability to enter the commercial market for
medium-term loans.  In July 1983 the Central Bank of Turkey received a
$200 million five-year syndicated loan for balance of payments needs. More
recently, an agreement was signed in March 1984 with a consortium of
36 foreign banks for a $300 million six-year syndicated loan for balance of
payments needs. In addition, a consortium of Swiss and German banks signed a
SwF 980 million credit in March 1984 for the financing of hydraulic and
electrical equipment for the Ataturk Daim.
27.      Turkey continues to be in good standing with the IMF.  A three-year
standby arrangement in an amount equivalent to SDR 1,250 million was approved
by the IMFts Board and became effective on June 18, 1980. The Government
purchased the full amount authorized under the arrangement. The Government
also purchased SDR 56.25 million against the one-year standby arrangement for
SI)R 225 million approved by the Fund in June 1983. Upon the election of the
new Government, Turkey requested cancellation of the existing standby and its
replacement with a new one-year arrangement in an amount equivalent to
SDR 225 million. This proposal was approved in April 1984 by the Fund's
Executive Board.

PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN TURKEY
28.      Through March 31, 1984 the Bank and IDA have lent $4,628.2 million 1/
to Turkey, through 77 projects. Agriculture accounts for 18 percent of funds
lent, industry and DFCs for 28 percent, power for 16 percent, structural
adjustment and program loans for 29 percent, and urban development,
transportation, education, tourism and technical assistance for the remaining
9 percent. As of March 31, 1984, I]FC commitments to Turkey totalled about
$240 million, of which about $74 million were still held by IFC. Annex II
provides a summary statement of Bank loans, IDA credits and IFC investments as
of March 31, 1984.
29.      The execution of Bank-financed projects in the public sector has been
slow, due in part to weak management, limited coordination amongst ministries,
staffing problems, and the serious external and domestic financial crises from
1977 to 1979. There has been notable improvement since September 1980.
Nevertheless, problems persist in many cases, reflecting difficulties in
staffing the public sector at current salaries, over-centralized bureaucratic
structures and continuing constraints on the availability of local funds. The
high interest rates for working capital combined with depressed domestic
demand and reluctance of investors to take the foreign exchange risk have
affected the implementation of private sector projects and led to slow
commitments under DFC lending. Disbursements for all sectors combined average
44 percent of appraisal estimates (excluding structural adjustment loans) as
compared to 54 percent for Tunisia and 42 percent for Morocco.
30.      Bank lending is aimed at supporting Turkey's medium-term objectives
of restructuring the Turkish economy by placing more reliance on market forces
and adopting a more outward-oriented strategy. These objectives also include
increasing domestic savings and reorienting a restrained public investment
program to reflect the Government's priorities of completing ongoing projects
faster and emphasizing quick-yielding new investments with positive balance of
payments impact. The main vehicle for the Bank's operational discussions with
the Government has been the structural adjustment lending (SAL) program. Four
SALs have so far been approved, and a proposal for a fifth is being
processed. The success of the SAL program has highlighted the need to develop
sector policy lending vehicles for continuing the policy dialogue at the
sectoral level.
31.      Agriculture, industry, energy and transportation will continue to be
the key sectors for Bank lending with the accent being placed on improving the
management of projects. In agriculture, the emphasis will be on irrigation,
credit, and reform of the extension and research services. In industry
(including DFCs), it will be on the promotion of exports, employment, and
increasing operational efficiency. Energy projects under preparation will
focus on power generation based on domestic hydro and lignite resources, as
well as enhanced oil recovery and oil and gas exploration. Lending for the
transport sector will focus on developing the infrastructure necessary
to facilitate exports and improve the efficiency of operations. Projects for
industrial training, urban development and public utilities may supplement
these efforts.
1/ Net of cancellations.

32.      The close macroeconomic and sector dialogue established with the
Government in recent years is expected to be pursued. The economic and sector
work undertaken recently includes studies of the agricultural and financial
sectors. Topics likely to be covered in the future include a review of the
next five-year development plan, including a review of major public sector
projects, a study focussing on the impact of structural adjustment, a review
of transport investments and studies of the engineering and agro-industries.
33.      This is the fifth loan to Turkey to be presented to the Executive
Directors this fiscal year. One other project is being processed, a proposed
fifth SAL.
34.      The Bank Group's share of the estimated total external debt was about
1L percent in 1982, and is expected to grow to about 16.0 percent by 1985; its
share of total debt service payments is projected to increase from about
12 percent in 1982 to about 15 percent in 1985.
35.      IFC has invested in synthetic yarns, textiles, pulp and paper, glass,
aluminum, cement, iron and steel products, heavy diesel engines, motor bicycle
engines, piston rings, food processing and tourism. It has also invested in
the Industrial Development Bank of Turkey (TSKB) and provided guarantees for
overseas contracting firms.  In addition, IFC is currently providing technical
assistance to the Government with respect to the development of the capital
market and a regulatory framework for leasing.
PART III - THE TRANSPORT SECTOR AND HIGHWAYS SUBSECTOR
36.      Transport is viital for the economic, political and social development
and integration of a country as large as Turkey, with populations and economic
activities spread over a wide area and where people and goods often have to
travel long distances over difficult terrain under severe climatic
conditions. Its economic role extends beyond its direct contribution to GDP
and employment through its indirect impact on such related activities as
construction, manufacturing, retail trade, insurance, police and taxation. It
had been one of the more dynamic sectors of the economy prior to 1978, when
traffic growth rates were about 1-1/2 times the growth rate of GDP. Since
that time, the growth of domestic traffic was practically halted under the
impact of the increases in oil prices and the 1980 economic stabilization
policies. During 1983 domestic traffic started to grow again at an annual
rate of about 4 percent.
37.      The transport system consists of about 61,000 km of primary and
secondary highways as well as about 220,000 km of tertiary roads and tracks;
about 8,000 route-km of railways; about 100 port and landing facilities,
including 15 major ports, and 16 airports of which 2 handle scheduled
int:ernational traffic. Road transport, which is in the hands of the private
sector, dominates the industry: in 1982 it accounted for 70 percent and
90 percent of total freight and passenger traffic respectively. The
corresponding share of railway freight was about 10 percent, down from
20 percent in 1976 (the peak of railway freight) and also about 10 percent for
railway passenger traffic. Data on coastal shipping traffic are not very
reliable, but its share in total freight transDort is estimated at about
20 percent, primarily oil products.



- 11 -
38.      Turkey's transport system has generally been able to meet transport
demand, although bottlenecks do occur and transport costs are often higher
than they would be if modern equipment and the appropriate infrastructure were
in place. At present, road transport is highly competitive and is able to
handle the trade offered apart from occasional unusual peak demands. The
principal problem is that the road infrastructure is below standard for
current traffic and deteriorating seriously, especially on the principal
transit and export routes, despite an active maintenance program. The ports
have little modern container handling equipment with the result that loading
and unloading operations are sometimes very slow and costly. The most serious
transport problem rests with the railways where traffic is being diverted to
other modes because of the poor quality of the railway services. Railway
operational capacity is so low that the Railways cannot accept all traffic
that is being offered. This has led to some bulk cargos being carried by
trucks on relatively long distances, with consequent additional costs of road
maintenance and repair.
39.      For the overall transport sector, there are some basic issues in
pricing, investment and in operational efficiency. For example, on pricing:
(i) road user charges for heavy trucks may not appropriately reflect costs
although overall road user revenues are adequate; (ii) the railways operate at
a loss; and (iii) port tariffs, while providing an adequate overall level of
revenues, are not related to the cost of specific activities in some areas.
User charges for heavy trucks and the question of relating port tariffs more
adequately to cost are being studied under on-going IBRD financed projects.
Investment planning and project preparation tends to be weak in the sector.
However, the State Highway Authority (KGM) has made significant advances in
these areas. Operational efficiency, is especially low in the railways,
leading to low productivity, poor quality and uncompetitive services.
40.      The Government's plans for the development of the sector are embodied
principally in the stabilization programs pursued since 1980 and, especially,
in the National Transport Master Plan (NTMP) for 1983-1993, which was approved
by the Government in 1983. In 1982, the most recent year for which reliable
figures are available, investment in transport amounted to nearly 20 percent
of total investment. This represenf:s a return to the share prior to the 1977
economic crisis. However, this recovery is largely the result of a surge in
the share of private investment, which has grown significantly with the growth
of international transit traffic and rising exports to the Middle East and
Gulf areas.
41.      The principal features of the NTMP are as follows:  (i) total freight
transport in ton-km is expected to grow at an average rate of 4 percent per
year and total passenger-km at 4.6 percent per year, assuming an average
annual growth rate of GDP of 5.5 percent; (ii) total investment in the
transport sector is expected to increase from 1.66 percent of GDP in 1983 to
3.35 percent in 1993 or from 18 percent of total public investment to
27 percent; (iii) an assumed shift in the modal allocation of investment
mainly from roads to the railways and coastal shipping, although roads retain
the largest share; (iv) an identification of transport corridors where
bottlenecks exist or are expected to arise; and (v) major investment projects
selected on the basis of a multi-criteria analysis.



- 12 -
42.      Although the NTMP has certain limitations, it is a valuable component
in the planning process for the sector in that it provides a first
coimprehensive long-term forecast of transport demand, as well as a general
framework and general directions for the development of the sector. It also
draws attention at an early stage to several corridors where bottlenecks are
likely to arise. Furthermore, the NTMP is to be supported by detailed
five-year plans, now being prepared for 1985-89 for each mode by each agency;
these plans are to be rolled over each year. The Government intends to update
the NTMP every three years, the first time in 1985, to take into account the
experience with its implementation during the preceding years and changing
economic forecasts.
43..     A draft transport sector memorandum was discussed with the previous
Government in July 1983. At that time, a broad consensus was reached on the
principal issues in the sector and the basic gDals and policy principles to be
pursued. In particular, the authorities agreed that tariffs should be based
on costs, although specific programs to reach this goal gradually would hlave
to be prepared for each mode. The authorities also accepted the need for
adequate project preparation, including the preparation of appropriate
feasibility studies for major investments, and the need to strengthen existing
institutions with a view to improving their performance. This understanding
needs to be confirmed with the new Government. KGM in the Ministry of Public
Works has already made an impressive start during the past two years in
introducing a system of comprehensive, detailed planning. A master plan for
the development of the ports has also been prepared. Discussions are underway
with the railways concerning the introduction of comprehensive corporate
planning.
Previous Bank Loans
44.      The Bank has participated in four previous projects in the transport
sector.  There have not been any Operations Evaluiation Reports on these
projects, but a report on the railways project is under preparation. In
general, the two earlier projects faced significant procurement and
administrative delays while the two more recent: projects are making reasonably
good progress. A $12.5 million loan for the First Port Project (28-TU),
approved in 1950, included extension of several ports, one new port and
equipment for handling specialized commodities. Following agreed project
changes, a supplementary loan of $3.8 million was made in 1954. Although
completion was delayed from 1958 to 1962, most of the physical works were
completed by 1959, with procurement for a relatively small part of the project
causing most of the delays.  A $75 million loan for a Second Port Project
(Loan 1741-TU), approved in 1979, aimed at the rehabilitation of the ten main
public ports. The project is expected to be completed during the current
year. Because of delays in procurement the Closing Date has been extended by
one year to June 30, 1984.
45.      A $46.7 million loan for a Railway Project (Loan 893-TU) was approved
in 1973. It included financing for track renewal, signalization and
telecommunications, manufacture of rolling stock, modernization of work shops,
training and technical assistance. Although much of the project had been
completed by the planned 1976 Closing Date, long delays due to management
problems and slbw procurement procedures resulted in completion of the project
only in May 1981. The project was largely successful in meeting its physical
objectives, principally track renewal.  However, it was less than successful
in achieving institutional and policy objectives, particularly those related
to improved procurement and financial viability.



- 13 -
46.      The First Highway Rehabilitation Project (Loan 2137-TU), approved in
April 1982, generally is being implemented satisfactorily. The rehabilitation
works are of good quality and are proceeding at a satisfactory rate. The
feasibility studies prepared by KGM for selection of road sections for Bank
financing have been of good quality. Progress has also been made under the
project in strengthening KGM project monitoring capability and supervision of
civil works under contract. However, two components of the project are behind
schedule. Under the loan the Borrower agreed that by December 31, 1983 as
part of a vehicle load control program, an analysis would be prepared of the
incremental damaging effect of heavy vehicles. Based on this, proposals would
be made for amending vehicle taxation regulations. The analysis has not yet
been completed although the vehicle load control program, which comprised a
major portion of the covenant's objectives, has been successfully
implemented.  A satisfactory interim report was submitted to the Bank during
negotiations of this proposed loan, and a revised schedule for completion of
the study by December 1985 was agreed. Similar delays have occured in meeting
the schedule under which the Borrower agreed to prepare a highway safety
program satisfactory to the Bank by July 31, 1984. A recent Bank mission
reports that progress is being made towards this goal. Revised terms of
reference for a highways safety study as well as a more realistic
implementation schedule were also agreed during negotiations of this proposed
loan. A first stage study, covering most of the scope of the study originally
agreed, is now expected to be completed by December 1985. A second phase,
including identification of safety hazards and preparation of a program of
remedial work, would be completed by December 1986.
The Highway Sub-Sector
47.      Responsibility for public roads is divided between the KGM of the
Ministry of Public Works and the Road, Water and Electricity Directorate (YSE)
of the Ministry of Agriculture. KGM is responsible for construction and
maintenance of primary and secondary roads totalling about 61,000 km, of which
about two-thirds are paved. YSE is responsible for the construction and
maintenance of some 220,000 km of tertiary rural roads and tracks, of which
approximately 6000 km are paved. During 1984 about 1,100 km of low volume
roads will be transferred from the responsbility of KGM to that of YSE or
abandoned, because they are no longer considered to be of regional
importance.
48.      The primary and secondary highway network carries about 70 percent of
total land freight traffic and about 90 percent of land passenger traffic, A
major part of the system was built in the 1950's and 1960's and is therefore
nearing the end of its normal service life, especially since actual traffic
volumes have been higher than had been anticipated when the roads were built.
Traffic counts and surveys of existing road conditions, carried out by KGM as
part of the preparation of its five-year plan, indicate that many primary
roads are deteriorating rapidly, despite heavy and technically satisfactory
maintenance, as they carry traffic volumes far in excess of their design
capacity. Road conditions are worst on the roads that have experienced the
rapid increase in transit and export traffic in recent years. To cope with
the current traffic volume, road pavements must be strengthened. In some
cases roads have deteriorated to such an extent that they require complete
reconstruction. The road rehabilital:ion program which was initiated under the
ongoing Highway Rehabilitation Project is to be extended under the proposed
project.



- 14 -
49.      KGM is carrying out an investigation of possible improvements in the
pavement design for Turkey and of the clevelopment of an economic pavement
management program. The proposecd project will assist KGM in both of these
Endeavors. It is hoped that the effort will lead to more economic designs of
pavements for Turkish conditions and also to improved allocation of
expenditures between highway rehabilitation, pavement strengthening and
highway maintenance. Related to this work it is expected that the
rationalization of the system of road user chlarges will be pursued.
50.      KGM is a compeitent and well run organization.  Its labor force, while
still large, has been reduced from 34,200 in 1981 to 31,600 in 1983. In
general, KGM higher level staff is competent., although in many cases refresher
courses and courses designed to expose them to up-to-date techniques of
planning, supervision, and works and equipment control are needed.  Under the
ongoing highway project and in preparation of the proposed project, KGM has
made important steps to improve its organizat:ion: the planning staff has been
strengthened and the planning approach has been broadened to cover the entire
network. A project monitoring unit, established in 1981, is making an
important contribution to improving project implementation; also the number of
field supervisory staff has been increased significantly. They are being
trained currently in mocdern methods to supervise the work of contractors. A
particularly important aspect is that initial steps have been taken to improve
highway safety, although research will continue in this field.
51.      Highway planning and design is the responsibility of KGM  with most
work being carried out "in house".  Consultants are only being used for
specialized works. KGM's investment programs, although prepared on an ad hoc
basis in the past, have been cost conscious and the road network generally has
not been overbuilt and serves the country well. More recently, and specially
in line with the framework provided by the NTMP and aided by the ongoing
Highway Rehabilitation Project, KGM has improved planning discipline.  Also it
has accepted more readily the use of economic criteria in project preparation
and planning.
52.      Highway expenditures are largely financed through the budget.  SPO's
approval is required for the investment budget and the Treasury's for the
recurrent budget (i.e. maintenance). Revenues obtained from road users for
the past five years show a substantial surplus over highway expenditure,
although vehicle license fees have not kept pace with inflation and revenues
from vehicle and spare parts taxes have been depressed.  The total 1984 KGM
budget, including maintenance, will be about $475 million (equivalent) and is
projected to increase by about 4 percent p.a. It is expected that the road
user revenues which reached about $800 million (equivalent) in 1983, although
increasing more slowly than the general level of prices, will continue to
cover expenditures. The Government will keep the relative trends under
regular review.
KGM's Highway Investment and Maintenance Programs
53.      The total costs of KGM's 1985-88 investment and maintenance programs
are estimated at $1,488 million and $650 million respectively, at April 1984
prices.  KGM highway investment and maintenance programs are based upon:
(i) projects identified and prepared at the Central Government's level,
including major projects such as motorways anc. major bridges; and
(ii) investment and maintenance programs prepared at local or regional level,
but subsequently analyzed and evaluated by the KGM Planning Department. The
program is translated on an economic priority basis into a rolling five-year



-- 15 -
program within the resource constraints laid down by the Central Government.
The financing plan is specified in the NTMP (Highway Section), which will be
subject to major review every three years: annual investment and maintenance
budgets may be affected by short-terra trends, but in 1983 and 1984 they were
appropriate to. financing plan targets. Should resources fall short of
targeted amounts or should traffic growth be less, the annual and five-year
rolling plans would be modified either by delaying start-up or cancelling
projects. A NTMP guideline, however, is to complete projects in the shortest
period practically and economically possible. Currently, routine and periodic
maintenance is to be given priority, but a careful study is being undertaken
to optimize the investment and maintenance mix, leading to a modern pavement
management system. The cost of routine and periodic maintenance averages
about $3,800 per km per annum and may be reduced or redistributed as more
roads are strengthened and rehabilitated.
54.      KGM's proposed investment program has been prepared according to the
methodology and criteria agreed for the selection of Bank-financed
subprojects. It is estimated to yield an overall rate of return of about 27
percent. The program is considered balanced and in keeping with identified
national priorities. The evaluation of subprojects shows that about
25 percent currently yield rates of return of less than 10 percent. This
conclusion requires interpretation. Typically the low yielding subprojects
are either physically ongoing or are in the program's outer years, and the
majority are low standard earth or gravel roads in less developed regions
carrying low traffic volumes and which are proposed to be upgraded to all
weather paved standards. While it is not practicable to stop ongoing works,
continued close cooperation with KGM should permit outer year projects to be
reevaluated as part of a continuing review process.  Although the data used in
subproject analysis are considered to be realistic, they are rather limited
and reevaluation should take into account a broader range of data, in
particular: (i) actual traffic growth may in some cases be higher than the
assumed average growth rates used in this model; (ii) generated traffic is
probably understated for subprojects designed to achieve major improvements in
operating conditions; and (iii) neither the value of passenger time savings
nor benefits from improved safety have been included. KGM's detailed plan for
1985-88 states that it is a major goal to ascertain the economic benefits for
each of the routes of the existing network and that investments in roads that
are found to be uneconomic are to be stopped. In fact, since project
appraisal in December KGM has continued the reevaluation of the investment
program. Approximately 1,100 km of roads are recommended for elimination from
the primary and secondary network; these will include some of the uneconomic
proposals.
55.      KGM's highway maintenance program consists of routine and some
periodic maintenance. Both are essential to the preservation of KGM's
existing capital assets. The program has been prepared on the basis of
detailed road condition inventories and proposed upgrading over the next five
years and data on geophysical and climatic conditions and traffic. The
preparation of the program has been reviewed by the Bank and is considered
technically sound and relevant to the system's needs. The question of the
correct balance between highway maintenance and highway improvement is being
addressed under a pavement research program which is expected to lead to a
modern pavement management system. However, this will be a gradual process in
view of the size of the country and the widely differing regional conditions.
Under these circumstances a calculation of a rate of return on the maintenance
program is not considered useful nor practicable. Recent experience shows



- 16 -
that highway maintenance program rates of return are typically in excess of
100 percent and, taking into account traffic volumes and climatic conditions,
there is no reason to expect that Turkey will depart from this norm.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
56.      A request for assistance for the project was received in
November 1982. It was prepared by KGM with the assistance of Bank preparation
missions. The project was appraised in Decemiber 1983. Negotiations were held
in Washington from April 24 to April 27, 1984L. The Turkish delegation was led
by Mr. Tunc Bilget, Chief Counselor for Financial and Economic Affairs of the
T,urkish Embassy in Washington D.C. It also included representatives of the
Treasury and KGM. A report entitled "Staff Akppraisal Report of a Second
Highway Project" No. 4978-TU, dated May 16, 1984, is being circulated
separately to the Executive Directors. The mrain features of the loan and
project are given in the Loan and Project Summary and in Annex III. Maps
showing the transport network of Turkey and the roads selected for
rehabilitation under the first tranche of this project are attached (IBRD
Map. Nos. 17912 and 17913).
Project Objectives
57.      The proposed project would continue and expand upon the objectives of
the Highway Rehabilitation Project (Loan 2137-TU), whose primary objective was
to assist KGM in the preparation and implementation of a sound highway
rehabilitation program. The proposed project would also assist in financing
art equipment renewal program primarily design(ed to improve highway maintenance
productivity. In addition, the proposed project would help improve pavement
research and management, and modernize the management and control of the
equipment fleet and spare parts. In the selection of subprojects for
financing under the loan, priority would be given to quick benefit yielding
sections of the highway network, especially those that carry transit or export
traffic.
Project Description
58.      The components of the proposed project are:  (i) selected subprojects
from KGM's civil works investment program covering road sections to be started
during 1985-88; (ii) procurement of equipment and spare parts needed by KGM to
modernize its investment and maintenance equipment fleet; (iii) fellowships
for training KGM staff; and (iv) consultant services for KGM to promote
pavement research and planning, and for other services related to the KGM
investment program.
Civil Works Subprojects
59.      A first-year program of subprojects suitable for Bank financing has
been identified from KGM's 1985-88 investment program. It consists of
rehabilitation and some upgrading of sections (totaling 279 km) of two main
highways that carry heavy volumes of traffic especially for the foreign
exchange earning transit and export traffic. It is estimated that this
program would yield a rate of return of about 70 percent. Detailed action
plans, including individual critical path programs for these subprojects, have
been prepared. The capacity of the existing monitoring and control unit would
be increased to meet the increased work load. Future years' subprojects to be
financed from the loan would be evaluated and selected according to



- 17 -
methodology and criteria acceptable to the Bank, from KGM's investment program
which would be reviewed on an annual basis (draft Loan Agreement,
Section 3.04).
Equipment and Spare Parts
60.      The maintenance of KGM's equipment fleet is of a very high standard.
However, due to past shortages of foreign exchange, the equipment fleet has
become over-aged on the basis of technical as well as economic criteria.
About 50 percent is currently more than 11 years old. In the absence of a
renewal program, in five years this could exceed 75 percent. Therefore, an
estimate of future requirements has been prepared on the basis of a detailed
study of road maintenance needs and an inventory of existing equipment. Based
upon this study, a four-year equipment renewal program was prepared, under
which obsolete and uneconomic equipment would be replaced and the equipment
composition would be changed to match the characteristics of the highway
system. Over the four-year period about 25 percent of the fleet would be
replaced and the size of the equipment fleet would be reduced. About
80 percent of the new equipment would be used for periodic and routine
maintenance. From the proposed $156 million program of equipment renewal,
about $32 million would be excluded from Bank financing due to the
Government's desire to use reserved procurement procedures, with the remainder
financed under the proposed project. In association with the proposed
program, the ongoing Loan 2137-TU is financing training for KGM personnel in
equipment fleet management and especially the control and management of spare
parts. Finally, KGM plans to introduce a nationwide, computerized spare parts
control system.
Consultancy Services and Training
61.      A program of fellowships abroad for its technical staff (about
250 man-months) is proposed to assist KGM in (i) management of the equipment
fleet and spare parts inventory; (ii) planning design and construction, and
(iii) pavement research and management. These fellowships would be a
continuation of a 60 man-months program provided under the Highway
Rehabilitation Project (Loan 2137-TU). The fellowships probably would be
provided in Western Europe by contractors, consultants, State Highway
Departments and Universities. A training program (10 man-months) has already
been drawn up to assist senior mechanical and computer staff of KGM to set up
and implement their equipment control program under the Highway Rehabilitation
Project. The ongoing program and the proposed fellowships are arranged by the
KGM's Training Department directly with the agencies concerned. A detailed
fellowship program would be agreed with the Bank during the annual program
reviews.
62.      The project also includes provision of consultancy services to KGM
for pavement research and management (initially two man-months), and for
engineering design and other specialized support (about 200 man-months).
During negotiations, KGM agreed that consultants would be employed with
qualifications, experience and termts of employment satisfactory to the Bank
(draft Loan Agreement, Section 3.03).

Project Cost and Financing
63.       The estimated total cost of the project, including physical and price
contingencies is $232.0 million. This includes about $87.4 million of
pavement works, $18.0 million of minor earthworks, $123.7 million of
investment and maintenance work equipment, and $2.9 million of consulting
service and training.  The foreign exchange cost of the project is estimated
to be about $185.9 million. The proposed loan would finance this amount plus
the front-end fee.
64.       The costs of highway rehabilitation proposed by KGM for Bank
financing for the the first year of the proposed loan, are based on quantities
derived from completed engineering studies and are based on KGM's 1984 unit
price schedule for contract works. These costs are comparable to those
obtained from bidding on similar works in Turkey. Costs for the
rehabilitation in subsequent years are estimated based upon the costs of the
first year's program. The foreign exchange component of the total cost of
pavement works is estimated at 65 percenit, and of related earthworks and
drainage works at 49 percent. These estimates assumed that 25 percent of the
pavement contracts will be won by foreign contractors and that local firms
will win all the earthworks and drainage contracts. 5 percent physical
contingencies and foreign exchange price contingencies at 7.5 percent for
1984, 7 percent for 1985 and 6 percent per year thereafter have been provided
for the civil works component.  (The do:Llar equivalents of local costs are
expected to escalate at about the same rate as the foreign exchange component,
due to the Government policy of floating the TL rate to accommodate the
difference between local and foreign inflation). No physical or price
contingency has been provided for the equipment, consultants or fellowship
components.
65.       Since KGM is exempt from custom duties and sales taxes on equipment
purchases, the capital cost of equipment and spares has been estimated using
1983 CIF prices for imported goods net of import duties, and the ex-factory
costs net of taxes for local goods. All equiJment costs include an allowance
of about 15 percent for the purchase of spare parts.
66.       Fellowship costs are based on current costs in Western Europe of
$2,500 per man-month. 'For consultancy services, which are expected to be
local and foreign, on highway safety and pavement research, a lump sum of
$2,300,000 is included based on up-to-date contract prices.
Project Management and Implementation
67.       KGM would be responsible for implementing all components of the
project and for overall loan and project administration. A Project Team would
be maintained within KGM, with organization and terms of reference
satisfactory to the Bank, to facilitate coordination and management of
execution of the Project (draft Loan Agreement, Section 3.02). Project
implementation would be based upon detailed annual project implementation
scheduling similar to that carried out for the ongoing Highway Rehabilitation
Project. Implementation is estimated to be spread over a six-year period
ending December 1990.  Critical path analysis has been used for each component
of project implementation. The overall implementation schedule has been
prepared taking account of experience under the First Highway Project and
includes an allowance of one extra year for possible slippages.



- 19 -
68.      A format of financial reports has been designed and agreed with KGM
for purposes of monitoring project expenditure, resources and Bank
disbursements. The annual financial reports would be prepared by KGM's
Accounts and Budget Department and sent separately to the Bank. Financial
control procedures are essentially a priori with auditing carried out by
Ministry of Finance inspectors. This has been proved to be satisfactory under
Loan 2137-TU. During negotiations, the Government and the Bank reached
agreement regarding the auditing requirements for the project (draft Loan
Agreement, Section 4.02).
69.      Project monitoring and reporting procedures include Government
preparation of; (i) indicative multi-year overall investment and maintenance
programs by October of each year; (ii) detailed annual programs each year,
including the results of project implementation during the past years;
(iii) quarterly progress reports on Bank-financed elements (physical and
financial); (iv) feasibility study reports as required for the investment and
maintenance programs; (v) bid evaluation reports; and (vi) audit reports on
Bank-financed elements of the project. Annually, and not later than October
31 of each year, commencing with 1935, the Government and the Bank would
review: (a) project performance during the current year; (b) the detailed
investment, maintenance and training programs of the project for the
forthcoming year; (c) the next year's selection of subprojects for financing
under the loan; (d) the proposed next yearts procurement of equipment; and
(e) the indicative program of highway investment for the remainder of the
four-year period, 1985-88. During negotiations, agreement was reached on the
annual review arrangements (draft Loan Agreement, Section 3.04).
Procurement and Disbursement
70.      The cost of civil works, including contingencies, which KGM intends
to submit for financing under the loan is estimated at about $106 million
equivalent, of which about $79 million equivalent of paving contracts would be
let under international competitive bidding (ICB) procedures. These contracts
are estimated to be between $3.0 million to $15.0 million each. The
contractors would be required to prequalify. Up to $18 million equivalent of
contracts below $3 million each for related earthworks and drainage and up to
$9 million of small paving contract:s below $3 million each may be procured
through local competitive bidding ILCB) procedures which are satisfactory and
which permit participation of foreLgn contractors. The local bidding
procedures are being used under the ongoing highway project with good
results. Equipment and spares to be financed under the loan have been
estimated at $123.7 million of which about $92 million would be let under
ICB. An additional $32 million of equipment, in contracts estimated to cost
under $3 million each, would be procured through LCB procedures. These would
be contracts for equipment for which Turkish suppliers are in a particularly
strong competitive position and the chance of foreign suppliers winning a
contract would be low. The LCB procedures have been reviewed and are
satisfactory. They permit participation by foreign firms on a
non-discriminatory basis. Contracts estimated to cost under $20,000 each, and
in the aggregate not to exceed $800,000, could be procured through local
shopping. Consultant services contracts would be awarded in accordance with
normal Bank procedures. Training fellowships proposed would be reviewed in
advance by the Bank.
71.      The proposed loan would be disbursed against the following items:
(i) contracts for civil works on selected road sections to be submitted by KGM
to the Bank in accordance with agreed procedures, 60 percent of the cost of



- 20 -
paving contracts and 45 percent of the cost of other contracts (earthworks,
drainage, and ancilliary works); (ii) contracts for procurement of equipment
and related spare parts for the KGM fleet, 100 percent of foreign expenditures
and 100 percent of local ex-factory expenditures and 40 percent of local
expenditures for items procured off-the-shelf; (iii) fellowship training,
100 percent; and (iv) consultants services, 100 percent.  The Government would
provide appropriate local counterpart funds. A revolving fund of $9 million
equivalent would be established to enable thE Government to make payments
directly for eligible expenditure (draft Loan Agreement, Schedule 5).
Establishment of the fund would be a conditicn of effectiveness (draft Loan
Agreement, Section 5.01).
Environmental Impact
72.      The net environmental impact of the project would be positive.  In
particular, the highway improvements would enhance highway safety and reduce
traffic congestion and air and noise pollution.
Benefits and Risks.
73.      The proposed loan would focus on the consolidation of the physical,
institutional and policy objectives of the ongoing highway rehabilitation
project. It would also serve to expand and develop the Government/Bank
dialogue in the transport sector, especially in highway project preparation
and evaluation.
74.      The first year's program of rehabilitlation subprojects includes two
sections, 37 km of the Ankara-Gerede road and the Gerede-Osmancik (242 km).
The former is an important link between Istanbul and Ankara, while the latter
services domestic traffic for the northern third of Turkey and the valuable
export and transit traffic to Iran. Project benefits from road user savings
for these sections produce economic rates of return of 83 percent and
66 percent respectively, or 70 percent on average. Additional benefits would
accrue from safety improvements and encouragement of increased export and
transit traffic to Iran. The equipment replacement program is based upon a
comprehensive survey of the existing fleet showing that a substantial portion
of KGM's equipment is beyond its useful economic life.  Equipment replacement
should reduce the cost and improve the quality of KGM's highway maintenance
program. The followship and training components should assist KGM in
improving investment planning, highway safety, and pavement management and
research, especially the use of less expensive road construction materials and
methods.
75.      The principal risks for the project are that government funding could
fall below total requirements, for example as a result of unforeseen economic
difficulties, or that traffic, particularly transit traffic to Iraq and Iran,
could be sharply reduced. In the event of a curtailment of government
funding, KGM's investment program would have to be adjusted, preferably by
postponing or eliminating investments of lesser priority. The annual review
of budget adequacy would give the bank arn early opportunity to assess this
financing risk which, though it might affect KGM's investment program as a
whole, would not necessarily affect the Bank-financed project. As to a
reduction of transit traffic, the prospects are that after the Iran/Iraq
hostilities cease, a high volume of transit traffic will continue to be needed
for some time to meet the demands of reconstruction. Furthermore, any
reduction in such traffic could be gradually compensated by rising volumes of



- 21 -
Turkish exports to the area. At worst under these circumstances, the benefits
from the proposed investments on these transit routes would be lower than
expected, but still sufficiently high to justify the planned investments.
This conclusion is supported by the results of sensitivity tests for the road
to Iran included in the first year's program.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
76.      The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of Turkey and the Bank
and the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of
the Articles of Agreement are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately. A special condition of loan effectiveness would be the opening of
the special account for the revolving fund (para. 71). Features of special
interest are listed in Annex III of this Report.
77.      I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENATION
78.      I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
