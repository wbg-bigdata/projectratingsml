I. SECTOR BACKGROUND
The Energy Sector
1.01     Preamble.  An overview on the energy sector and the power subsector
in the Yemen Arab Republic (YAR) is in the Staff Appraisal Reports for Credits
837-YAR (Power Distribution Project), 1102-YAR (Regional Electrification
Project), and 1361-YAR (Third Power Project). A brief account on these
projects is given in para. 2.08, while detailed information on the energy
sector, prior to the recent discovery of oil and gas, can be found in other
Bank reports. 1/ Most recent information regarding the oil and gas discovery
is sumuuarised below.
1.02     Energy Resources and Development.  With the exception of the recently
discovered oil and gas in the Marib Basin, YAR has no known commercial energy
resources.  Up to the end of 1983, efforts at locating commercially
exploitable petroleum resources had been unsuccessful. However, the oil
exploration activities by Runt Oil Company (HOC) in the Marib basin revealed
in July 1984 the presence of oil with associated gas. Although the size of
the reservoir has not yet been fully delineated, the Government in September
1985 announced the field comnercially exploitable; reserves are estimated at
about 500 bbl million. Following the HOC find the Government has signed three
separate concession agreements for on-shore and off-shore exploration for oil
and gas.
1.03     Since 1983 the Government has been studying a pipeline project to
meet economically the needs for supply and distribution of petroleum products
in YAR to year 2000. The original project design involved construction over
two phases. The first phase consisted of a marine terminal and storage
facilities at Salif, and a 40-km 10-inch pipeline from Salif to a tank farm at
Al Turbah; and the second phase consisted of an 8 inch pipeline to Sana'a
through Ma'abar. However, following the discovery of oil at Marib, the
Government decided to construct near the oil field a small refinery with a
10,000 bbl per day throughput. Production of the refinery would satisfy about
one third of YAR's demand for gasoline and diesel oil and about half the
domestic demand for fuel )il to 1987. In the light of the new developments
the Government decided to construct only the first phase of the pipeline
project.
1.04     There are indications of geothermal activity in several locations in
YAR. Consu7'-znt studies in the Dhamar area indicate sufficient potential to
justify an exploratory drilling program. Under a Credit (Geothermal

Energy Sector, Report No. 4892-YAR, February 1984; Yemen Arab Republic
Power Subsector Review, Report No. 4314-YAR, June 23, 1983; Yemen Arab
Republic Electricity Pricing Study, Report No. 5239-YAR, October 19, 1984.



Exploration Project, Credit 1484-YAR) granted by the International Development
Association (IDA) about US$13 million had been provided to assist in the
exploration for geothermal resources. However, following the recent discovery
of oil and gas, the Government requested, and IDA agreed, to cancel this
Credit because it is now clear that the project would not fit within the
development program of the sector.
1.05     Energy Consumption.  Gross energy consumption has grown over the last
decade at an average annual rate of 6.3% reaching 2.3 million toe in 1982
(last year for which reliable data is available). During the same year
traditional resources, fuel wood, crop residue and animal wastes met 60% of
total energy consumption; the balance was met by imported petroleum products
which, over the last decade, has grown at an annual average rate of about 20%,
principally due to the high level of economic activity, popuiation growth, and
rate of urbanization. A roughly estimated 3 million tons (1.35 million toe)
annual consumption of fuel wood, mostly by households, has resulted in severe
depletion of YAR's forest resource. The significant overcutting of fuel wood
-  which has led to scarcity and, consequently, high prices -  is resulting in
a desirable economic trend towards substitution by liquified petroleum gas
(LPG) for cooking.  Consequently, the share of co  ercial energy in the total
energy consumption is expected to increase from about 40% currently to about
70% in 1991. Annex 1.1 shows the historic consumption of petroleum products.
1.06     Net electricity consumption in YAR increased from about 100 GWh in
1975 to about 867 GWh in 1984, of which about 33% (287 GWh) was provided by
the public supply system.  The remainder was made up by private producers.
The growth rate of consumption from the public supply system was 34% per annum
between 1975 and 1980 and about 24% per annum between 1980 and 1984. Despite
these high growth rates, there was still a high level of unsatisfied demand
due to an inadequate public distribution system. Maximum demand on the public
supply system increased from about 11 MW in 1975 to about 86 MW in 1984.
Details are provided in Annex 2.1.
1.07     Electricity Demand Forecast.  Gross electricity consumption from the
public system is forecast to grow at an average annual rate of about 14% from
1985 to 1990 mainly due to the connection of new consumers. The highest
growth rate during this period is expected to be from the rural sector where
the expected growth is forecast at an annual average rate of 32%. This rather
high growth rate would result from the Government's extensive rural
electrification program in both existing markets with a high level of
unsatisfied demand, and new markets of which the proposed Project forms a
part. Forecast future demand is given in Annexes 1.2, 2.1 and 5.1.
1.08     Petroleum Products Pricing.  With the exception of LPG, all products
are priced at or above their economic costs. Fuel cost to the Yemen General
Electricity Corporation (YGEC), following the Government's decision to allow
the corporation to purchase fuel competitively on the world market, is at the
economic cost. Prices of petroleum products and their relationship with
economic costs is shown in Annex 1.3.
1.09     Electricity Tariffs.  YGEC's tariff structure consists of a simple
kilowatt-hour rate which is applicable at all times regardless of the time of
day in which consumption occurs, and a fixed monthly charge. The fixed



- 3 -
monthly charge is based on the type of consumer (domestic, commercial,
industrial, etc.) and type of supply (single-phase and three-phase). Large
medium voltage (MV) consumers pay a charge based on reserved capacity.
Details of YGEC's tariff structure are provided in Annex 1.4.
1.10     In addition to the above tariffs, each new consumer pays a connection
charge, part of which is refundable after termination of service. The
connection charge ranges from YRls 2,000 (YRls 1,350 is non-refundable) to
YRls 3,000 (YRls 2,000 non-refundable) for single-phase and three-phase
domestic supplies, respectively. New industrial and commercial consumers pay
a connection charge of YRls 6,000 (YRls 3,767 non-refundable).
1.11     The existing tariff structure does not provide any incentive for
large industrial consumers to shift part of consumption from peak to off-peak
period which would contribute to improvement in efficiency of power
generation. In accordance with the recommendations of the Electricity Pricing
Study undertaken by IDA, YGEC agreed to introduce time-of-day tariffs for
large consumers in 1988 when it would have installed appropriate metering
facilities and trained its commercial staff in the implementation of such
tariffs.
1.12     Economic Cost of Supply. At the request of the Government, IDA
undertook in 1984 a review of electricity pricing. 1/ The study's main
recommendations aimed at addressing YGEC's weak financial position in the
short-term, and the gradual introduction of economic cost-based tariffs for
all consumers by 1990. The recommendation to introduce fixed charges was
implemented by the Government in April 1985 to enable YGEC to meet its
financial targets covenanted under Credit 1361-YAR.
1.13     The weighted average economic cost of supply from the interconnected
system is estimated at YRis 0.96/kWh (US$0.128/kWh) compared to the existing
weighted average rate of YRls 1.36/kWh (US$0.181/kWh). Existing tariffs are,
therefore, on the average, about 142X of the economic cost of supply. Details
of comparison of existing tariffs with economic costs of supply is provided in
Annex 1.4.
1.14     Economic Cost of Supply and Cost of Private Generation.  The decision
of an existing autoproducer to take YGEC supply depends on the difference
between his avoidable financial cost, mainly fuel and lubricants estimated at
about YRls 0.64/kWh, and YGEC's industrial tariff of YRls 0.65/kWh which is
slightly less than the economic cost of supply (YRls 0.67/kWh). Since the
difference between the consumers' avoidable financial cost and YGEC's tariff
is small, it is believed that most existing autoproducers would opt to take
supply from YGEC because: (a) they would secure higher reliability of supply
(save their machines for standby purposes); (b) they would avoid the frequent
shortage of spare parts and the substantial heavy investments associated with
plant replacement; and (c) they are, in most cases, exonerated of connection
charges as long as their

guaranteed monthly consumption is at least 100,000 kWh. 1/ The cost of new
industrial autogeneration is estimated at YRls 0.92/kWh (US$0.123/kWh) which
is about 137f of YGEC's estimated economic cost of supply to large industry.
YGEC's tariff provides, therefcre, the right incentive to a potential
autoproducer to take YGEC supply. This is also economically efficient from
the national viewpoint.
1.15     Government's Energy Policy.  Prior to the Marib oil and gas discovery
the Government's energy policy was aimed at reducing the dependence on
imported energy and the rate of depletion of the country's fuel wood resource,
and at diversifying the country's energy resource base. The strategy to
achieve this objective involved the acceleration of the program for the
exploration for oil and gas, improvement in the efficiency by which petroleum
products were being delivered and consumed, and where it is found economic,
the extension of electricity supply from the interconnected national grid to
the major towns and villages which are supplied from small isolated generating
stations operating on diesel oil. At the Government's request, IDA has been
supporting the Government in all these efforts which are in line with IDA's
country assistance strategy.
1.16     IDA's Strategy.  IDA's strategy as agreed with the Government, for
the development of the power subsector in YAR is aimed at supporting
Government efforts to:
Ca) expand YGEC's distribution system in order to meet unsatisfied demand
and optimally use the available capacity;
(b) develop and implement a balanced least-cost investment program;
(c) improve YGEC's management and staff skills;
Cd) increase YGEC's efficiency of generation, transmission and
distribution; and
(e) reduce losses and increase revenues.
1.17     Although the recent discovery of oil and gas has not changed the
Government's strategy for the development of the power subsector, it has added
another dimension to it; investigation of the possible use of associated and
non-associated gas for power generation. Responding to the Government's
request IDA has planned to undertake in FY86, as part of its Economic and
Sector Work (ESW), a review of the implication of the domestic oil and gas
discovery on YAR's economy, including the power subsector.
1.18     Sectoral Context and Proiect Objectives.  Implementation of the
proposed Project dould displace the consumption of kerosene used for lighting,
1/ Recently YGEC has signed a number of supply contracts with large
industrial autoproducers, which incorporates a take-or-pay provision based
on a minimum monthly consumption of 100 MWh.



and diesel oil used in power generation from inefficient isolated (public and
private) generating sets. In addition, the proposed Project is aimed at
achieving a more balanced growth of the power system, and at following up on
the task specific programs initiated under previous IDA Credits to address the
principal causes of system losses, improve YGEC's management and financial
position, and enhance the skills of YGEC's staff. Thus the Project is in line
with both the Government's and IDA's objectives in the power subsector.



II. THE POWER SUBSECTOR
2.01     Power Subsector Development.  Public electricity supply in YAR is the
responsibility of YGEC. The corporation inherited a number of dilapidated
power systems when it was created in 1975. Since then YGEC embarked on rapid
expansion and system improvement programs; installed capacity increased from
15 MW in 1975 to 232 MW by 1984. By early 1984, the main towns (Sana'a, Taiz,
Hodeidah, Amran, Dhamar, Yarim, and Ibb) had been interconnected (either
permanently or temporarily) through the newly constructed 132-kV transmission
system mainly supplied by the thermal power plant at Ras Katenib (RK).
However, many large towns are still supplied by isolated diesel generating
stations equipped with small (500 to 1,000 KVA) sets. The Government's
objective is for YGEC to permanently connect all large towns to the national
grid, and to implement a program that would provide public electricity service
to about 80Z of the population by 1998. Considering that only about lOS of
the population is currently supplied by YGEC and 252 by private producers, the
dispersed nature of the rural population, the financial constraints and the
shortage of skilled labor, the Government's target seems very optimistic.
YAR's electrification program should be viewed within the broad macroeconomic
investment policy and objectives of the country, and should examine the
possibility of private participation in rural electrification as is currently
the practice. Details of YGEC's system are provided in Annex 2.1.
2.02     YGEC's past expansion program placed emphasis on the construction of
generating and transmission facilities without a comparable growth in the
distribution system. Currently a steam power station (4x40 MW) is being
constructed at Al-l!ukha (AM) which when fully commissioned (about 1988) would
bring the available generating capacity to about 75% in excess of the system's
maximum demand. However, by 1995, and provided additional distribution
facilities are constructed, the excess capacity would be fully exhausted and
additional generating capacity would be required. To achieve the Government's
objective (para. 2.01) while making full use of the available capacity,
emphasis should continue to be placed on the expansion of the distribution
system.
2.03     Since its creation, YGEC has undertaken a considerable number of
studies on generation, transmission, distribution, management, dispatching,
etc. Each study invariably made recommendations aimed at addressing the issue
at hand in isolation from other broader considerations, such as financing and
labor constraints. To remedy this deficiency which has led to unbalanced
investment decisions, YGEC has agreed under Credit 1361-YAR to appoint
consultants to review, update and consolidate into one study all
recommendations included in the existing studies, formulate a balanced system
development plan, produce cost estimates, and prepare a manpower plan. The
objective of this study was to help YGEC to rationalize its future investment
program, and enable the Government and the corporation to pursue in a timely
manner the necessary financing arrangements. In view of the implications the
recent oil and gas discovery would have on YGEC's investment program, it was
agreed to delay this study until the energy sector was reviewed in its
entirety (see paras. 1.17 and 2.04).



2.04     IDA and consultants' studies completed in the recent past indicate
that geothermal-based and coal-fired generation could offer the least-cost
means of meeting future demand for electricity. However, given the recently
discovered oil and gas fields, it is necessary to review these studies and
other existing studies associated with the development of the power subsector
(para. 2.03). Thus the scope of the study covenanted under Credit 1361-YAR
would be broaden to encompass: (i) the review of all system expansion studies
undertaken by YGEC since 1980, the load forecast, the choice of fuel and
generation technology, and the location of future power stations; (ii) the
consolidation into one report all recommendations pertinent to the evol-7ing
new environment; and (iii) the formulation of a balanced system development
plan, including cost estimates, and a manpower development plan.   The study
should be commissioned by December 30, 1986.
2.05     Subsector Organization.  The Ministry of Electricity and Water (MEW)
is responsible for the formulation of policies and plans for the development
of the power subsector in addition to its responsibility for the development
and exploitation of water resources in Yemen, and the control and licensing of
private and industrial autogeneration.  YGEC is entrusted with the generation
and distribution of public electricity supply. Private generation and
distribution systems, generally constructed to poor technical standards,
account for about 67X of total electricity consumption. There is a clear need
for MEW to codify construction standards of electrical networks and
installations for use by the private electricity producers, and monitor
compliance to those standards.  To assist MEW in this task, funds were made
available under Credit 1361-YAR for the hiring of a consultant to assist MEW
in developing simplified construction drawings and instructions. This study
has not yet been initiated due to MEW's staffing constraints and the priority
given in resolvirg claims arising from the implementation of important
contracts let by YGEC. MEW has, however, agreed to have this work completed
by December 1986.
2.06     YGEC's Organization and Management.  YGEC is managed by a
Government-appointed Board of Directors and a Management Committee (MC).
Policy making is the responsibility of the Board of Directors which consists
of a Chairman (the Minister of MEW), a Vice Chairman (the Deputy Minister of
MEW), and nine members. The MC, consisting of the Managing Director (member
of the Board of Directors), the Deputy Managing Director, and 12 members, is
responsible for day-to-day management of the company. Supported by central
staff departments for planning, engineering, finance, accounting and billing,
personnel, procurement etc., the MC prepares the plans of activity and budgets
which have to be approved by the Board of Directors before they are submitted
for final approval to the Council of Ministers.
2.07     Operations are conducted through six decentralized regions and 27
branch offices. The regional managers who are members of the MC report to the
Managing Director, while the branch offices report to the regional managers.
Although each region has its own technical, administrative, accounting,
billing, and purchasing department, all regions depend on the head office for
support in system planning, project preparation, and procurement of equipment
and materials. Branch offices, on the other hand, depend on the regions for
support in construction and supply of materials, and major maintenance of
facilities. The existing organization structure leads to overstaffing and



- 8 -
needs to be restructured in line with YGEC's needs to better serve its rapidly
increasing consumers and to manage its huge investment program. YGEC '8
management structure is being reviewed by the Electricity Supply Board of
Ireland (ESB), the consultants who have been appointed, as agreed under Credit
1361-YAR, for the preparation and implementation of a Financial Recovery Plan
(FRP) for YGEC. Details of YGEC's organizational structure are given in
Annex 2.2.
2.08     IDA Involvement in the Power Subsector.  The proposed Project would
be the fourth IDA operation in the power subsector in YAR. The first (Credit
837-YAR) granted in 1978 provided US$10 million to cover part of the foreign
exchange cost of a project involving the rehabilitation of the distribution
networks of Sana'a, Taiz and Hodeidah, the training of YGEC's staff, a study
for the formulation of the National Electrification Program (NEP), and
consultancy services. The project was cofinanced by the Netherlands, a
buyer's credit, the Government and YGEC. Implementation of the Project has
been slow (delayed by 30 months) because of difficulties experienced in
securing the buyer's credit to complete the financing package, and YGEC's lack
of experience in procurement through International Competitive Bidding (ICB).
Currently, the project is nearing completion, and YGEC with the assistance of
their consultant Kennedy and Donkin (K&D) has started preparing the Project
Completion Report (PCR). The second Credit (Credit 1102-YAR) granted in 1981
provided Standard Drawing Rights (SDR) 9.4 million to cover part of the
foreign exchange cost of a Project involving the supply of electricity service
to 18 villages and the three principal farmers' markets at the cities of
Sana'a, Taiz and Hodeidah, an energy study aimed at formulating a detailed
strategy for phasing out the subsidies for petroleum products, 1/ review of an
earlier tariff study conducted by British Electricity International, and
on-the-job training of YGEC's staff. The Project was cofinanced by the OPEC
fund, the Government and YGEC. In October 1984, the component relating to the
farmers' markets was completed with a delay of only four months, and the
supply of electricity service to the rural areas was completed in October 1985
with a delay of 16 months. Delay of the rural component was due to the
contractor's low performance. YGEC assisted by its consultants has started
preparing the PCR. The third Credit (Credit 1361-YAR) granted in 1983
provided SDR 17.5 million to cover part of the foreign exchange cost of a
Project involving the supply of electricity service from the national grid in
rural areas, the rehabilitation, reinforcement and expansion of the
distribution networks in the cities of Sana'a, Taiz and Hodeidah, the
connection of industrial load to the national grid, and the financing of
consultancy services. Implementation of the Project is about 18 months late
due to the Government's delay in meeting the effectiveness conditions and the
slowness of the National Bank of Yemen in opening the letters of credit for
contracts awarded. Currently all major contracts have been awarded and
implementation is scheduled to start by mid - 1986.
2.09     YGEC Power Supply Facilities.  By the end of 1984 YGEC's installed
generating capacity was 232 MW of which 91S (211 MW) was interconnected and
1/ After the Government's decision in 1981 to eliminate fuel subsidies in one
step, this study was considered inappropriate and it was not undertaken.

installed at the steam plant at RK (4x33 MW) and the diesel stations at
Sana'a, Hodeidah, Taiz, Hajjah, Ibb, and Dhamar (79 MW). The remaining 21 MW
was dispersed around the country in isolated stations. The network consisted
of 1,145 km of transmission (132 kV) and subtransmission (33 kV) lines and
cables, and about 5,798 km of medium voltage (15, 11 and 10 kV) and low
voltage lines and cables (Annex 2.1).
2.10     When the station at AM is brought into service (about 1988) YGEC's
installed capacity would be about 427 MW compared to the projected maximum
demand of about 170 MW.
2.11     YGEC's System Losses.  The dilapidated systems inherited by YGEC upon
its creation were beset with high le.els of losses which in 1980 were
estimated at about 30Z of gross generation. The projects which have been
implemented since then have reduced the distribution losses, but the
commissioning of the partially loaded steam power plant at RK - equipped with
a water desalination plant - and of the transmission line has brought YGEC's
system losses to an estimated level of about 35Z of gross generation. It
should be noted, however, that thest- losses include all unbilled energy
consumed at YGEC plants and premises, and employees' homes who enjoy free
electricity supply (para 2.12).
2.12     Within the context of the FRP and the metering consultancy contract
(para. 2.17), a plan for measuring, monitoring and gradually reducing system
losses was agreed between YGEC and IDA. This plan involves the following:
(a) installation of electricity meters in all YGEC premises and
employees' homes;
(b) reading of all such meters;
Cc) issuing of bills for all such meters even if payment is not due;
(d) creation of special teams to inspect all meters installed and report
damaged meterd, identified malpractices and unauthorized customer
connections;
(e) routine replacement of all old meters with new standardized types of
meters;
(f) construction of a new meter laboratory equiped with the necessary
testing, calibrating and measuring equipment and instruments;
(g) training of staff to man the meter laboratory and regional consumers'
departments; and
(h) amend the rule of free electricity supply to employees and set levels
of maximum monthly consumption beyond which employees will be charged
as regular customers.
2.13     By December 1984 meters were installed in all YGEC premises and
employees' homes, and by mid-1986 all such meters will be read and bills
issued on regular basis. By April 1985 three meter inspection teams had been



- 10 -
created in the Sana'a region and more staff is currently being trained to man
all regional offices. The metering consultant visited Yemen in September 1985
and his report incorporating his recomnendations would be available shortly.
Finally, YGEC's management is working on a proposal which would amend the rule
of free electricity supply. The proposal will be discussed with IDA and then
presented to the Minister of Electricity and Water for approval. The approved
scheme is expected to be implemented by mid-1986. The replacement of old
meters would be accomplished over a period of about four years and would
require the purchase of about 60,000 new meters. This task would be initiated
in 1988 and would be supported by the proposed Project which will finance the
purchase of the first tranche (about 8,000) of meters (para. 3.02). The
remaining steps of the plan are expected to be initiated in 1986.
2.14     YGEC's Manpower.  Currently, YGEC has 2,867 employees of which 60 are
expatriates, 51 are engineers and degree holders in other disciplines, 279
administrative, 90 foremen, 616 finance, accounting and comercial, 216
trainers and trainees, 913 skilled and 642 unskilled staff. Of YGEC's total
staff, 260 are at the head office in Sana'a, and the remaining are divided
among the regions. Considering the size of the system YGEC has excess of
unskilled labor but suffers from acute shortage of engineers, accountants,
skilled and semiskilled labor, which is one of the subsector's biggest
development constraints. Thus, since its creation YGEC has had to depend on
consultants and expatriate staff for highly technical operational matters.
Overall, the services provided by the expatriates and the consulting firms are
good. Taking into consideration the slow prpcess of training specialized
staff, YGEC's dependence on expatriate expertise is expected to continue for
some years to come.
2.15     Training.  To overcome the shortage of qualified personnel, YGEC
introduced in 1976 a program for the training of various levels of managerial,
administrative and technical staff. Training was to take place, both abroad
and in Yemen supported by aid agencies and international lending institutions
including IDA and the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development (AFESD).
Training abroad had a slow start due to the difficulty in identifying
candidates possessing the required academic background. Up to 1979 only 17
persons were sent for language and technical training abroad. At present 33
trainees, partly financed under Credit 837-YAR, are undertaking in the UK
degree, higher diploma and diploma courses (3 to 4 years) in mechanical and
electrical engineering, a further 32 trainees are taking either an engineering
foundation course to be followed by higher diploma courses or initial English
language training, one staff member is attending a 3-year computer course, and
34 are being trained for one year by Ansaldo Impianti (Italy) in the operation
of the AM power plant. In addition, 36 staff members and four managers (also
partly financed under Credit 837-YAR) were sent to Italy, Greece, Ireland,
Jordan and the UK for 3 to 6 months training in steam power plant operation,
accounting and finance, and customer departments.
2.16      Training in YAR was also delayed till January 1, 1981, because no
facilities were available, and construction and manning of the training center
at Dhaban (suburb of Sana'a), financed by the French Cooperative Program (FCP)
and IDA, took a few years to complete. Currently, the center provides
training for 84 resident trainees per year. The programs offered vary from 6



- 11 -
months to 3 years. Although the first group of trainees completed the 3-year
program in June 1985, it is very early to make an evaluation of the quality of
training provided at Dhaban. There are indications, however, that a big
forward step has been achieved. The facilities of the center are also used
for on-the-job training provided by contractors who are constructing project
facilities. This form of training is proving to be more effective in meeting
YGEC's immediate needs of skilled and semiskilled staff.
2.17     in addition to the above training, IDA under Credit 837-YAR financed
training support material for the Dhaban Center, the hiring (for 2 years) of a
teacher of English stationed at RK, the hiring (for one year) of a senior
operator/trainer accountant (para. 4.02), the training abroad (for 3 months
each) of a metering engineer, a telecommmications engineer, and two
administrative employees associated with insurance and stores handling related
matters, and the execution of a training study conducted by the British
Council (BC). Under Credit 1361-YAR, IDA financed among other the undertaking
of a study which would examine the technical and training issues associated
with metering, energy losses and theft.
2.18     The study conducted by the BC concluded that training should continue
at the Dhaban Center, the RK power plant and abroad, and should be
complemented with:
(a) integrated on-the-job training in YAR, short courses and basic skills
training at bhaban for new recruits, and specialized training at RK
(i.e. in operations, and in maintenance);
(b) continued education of good performers studying abroad to the highest
qualification they can achieve;
(c) alignment of course preferences of students studying abroad with
YGEC's manpower requirements; and
(d) specialized training for about 9 months with electric utilities of
students who have completed their academic studies.
BC's recommendations and YGEC's manpower requirements are attached as
Annex 2.3, while a copy of the report can be found in the Project File.
2.19     Capitalizing on the experience gained to date, and following on the
training efforts initiated under previous IDA Credits, BC and ESB
recommendations, the proposed Project includes a training component consisting
of:
(a) support of the ongoing long-term academic training;
(b) support of short term specialized training abroad;
(c) support of on-the-job training abroad and in Yemen; and
(d) funding of experts/trainers to assist MEW in introducing the
developed electricity standards (para. 2.05), and to assist YGEC in
implementing ESB's recommendations regarding stores management,



- 12 -
inventory control and accounting (para. 4.08), implementing the
recommendations of the metering consultant (paras. 2.12 and 2.17).
and other activities not yet identified. 1,
2.20     Financing of formal training would start with academic year
1986-1987. Financing of operators/trainers and on-the-job training, both
abroad and in YAR, would start in 1987 and would be decided on a case-by-case
basis. Since the proposed Credit is not anticipated to be effective by June
30, 1986, retroactive financing of up to US$500,000 would be required to cover
incurred training and consultancy expenses (para 3.16).
2.21     Power System Planning.  YGEC is responsible for planning the
development of its system. Although YGEC's ability in project identification
has improved considerably during the last three years, most planning and
project preparation is still carried out by consultants. Proposed projects
are approved by MEW which, in consultation with the Central Planning
Organization (CPO), formulates the necessary project financing plans. Major
decisions involving generation and transmission are finalized by the Council
of Ministers.
2.22     Experience with Past Lending.  The previous thi.ae power projects
provided the opportunity for the Association to engage in a meaningful
dialogue with YGEC and the Government on the problems of the subsector, since
the early years of YGEC's creation. With other lending institutions and aid
agencies involved in the financing of generating facilities, the main thrust
of all IDA Credits was towards the development of the distribution system,
institution building, and manpower development. As a result of IDA's
involvement, YGEC's organizational structure was revised oncp and more
revisions are being studied in order to improve YGEC's management; shortages
in key operational positions were identified and continuing efforts are being
made to make available to YGEC qualified staff or operators/trainers financed
by various aid donors and IDA; a system planning department and a distribution
department were established and steps to improve YGEC's project identification
and preparation were taken; a monitoring and data recording system was
initiated; a utility accounting system was established (para. 4.01); a
reporting system was introduced; bidding procedures were set up and an
inventory control and stores management system was established; and training,
both in Yemen and abroad, was initiated. In addition, general policy issues
such as rationalization of fuel prices and electricity tariffs were
addressed. In all these fields progress has been uneven; IDA's first
involvement in the power subsector started when YGEC was only one year old
and, last but not least, the labor force is drawn from a population pool
which, although improving, is still characterized by very low levels of
education or training. Against this background, it is clear that YGEC has
come a long way in a relatively short period and that IDA's participation has
contributed significantly towards the improvement of the power subsector.
However, much remains to be done and IDA's continued involvement should
continue to be beneficial in assisting YAR in the development of the energy
sector, and in the institutional development of the entities associated with
this sector.
1/ Funding of expert assistance would be mainly under the AFESD's loan.

III. THE PROJECT
3.01     Project Obiectives.  The proposed power distribution Project is
designed to assist YGEC to capture the biggest possible share of benefits
accruing from the Corporation's earlier investment in more efficient
generating and transmission facilities. It would enable YGEC to increase its
sales (revenues), achieve fuel savings both by operating its steam units at a
greater level of efficiency and by supplying industrial customers who would
otherwise be using diesel oil, and discourage autogeneration. The proposed
Project, when completed, would initially extend electricity service to about
23,000 new consumers (potential consumers are estimated at about 41,000),
ensure 24-hour supply, and improve the quality of service to more than 15,000
existing consumers. In addition the Project would contribute further toward
YGEC's institutional development by providing suitable training, advisory
assistance, help in reducing system losses, and in improving YGEC's
management, planning and forecasting capabilities.
3.02     Proiect Scope and Location.  The proposed Project is a continuation
of the effort initiated under Credits 837-YAR, 1102-YAR and 1361-YAR and is
aimed at mainly extending service from the interconnected grid to the largest
possible number of consumers. It would consist of plant, works and services
required for:
(a) the reinforcement and ring connection of the temporary interconnected
towns of Ibb, Dhamar, Rada'a and Yarim and the extension of their J
distribution systems to supply the surrounding areas;
(b) the extension of the distribution system of the isolated power
station at Al-Beida, and the installation of isolated power stations
and the associated distribution systems at Al-Fara and Al Mantaqe;
(c) the connection to the national grid of large towns and large nearby
villages situated in the areas of Thila, Hababah, Shibam, Raydah, and
Khamer;
(d) the connection to the national grid of the town of Sanhan and large
nearby villages;
(e) the construction of a meter laboratory in Sana'a and the replacement
of old electricity meters; and;
(f)  the improvement of YGEC's technical, financial and administrative
capabilities by providing funds for expert assistance, construction
supervision, training, and the second phase of YGEC's Financial
Recovery Plan consultancy contract (para. 4.08).
3.03     The proposed project would be financed by four co-financiers (para.
4.14), and procurement of goods and works would have to comply with three
different guidelines (paras 3.11 and 4.14). To facilitate contract packaging,
implementation, disbursement and supervision, the proposed project has been
divided into five components; three relating to the supply of goods and works
associated with Area 1 (Ibb, Dba-ar, Rada'a, Yarim, Al-Beida, Al-Fara,



- 14 -
Al Mantaqe and nearby villages), Area 2 (Thila. Bababah, Shibam, Raydah,
Khamer and nearby villages), and Area 3 (Sanhan and nearby villages), one
relating to the financing of Technical Assistance (construction supervision,
financial recovery plan, and meter laboratory), and one relating to the
financing of training (expert assistance and training) and the purchase of
additional electricity meters.
3.04     Considering that any future generating plant would most likely be
constructed close to either the oil field at Marib, or the Marib-Salif oil
pipeline, or the Red Sea coast the transmission lines which would connect the
plant(s) to the national grid will not affect the proposed Project (see Map -
IBRD 19074).
3.05     Project Description.  The proposed Project consists of the supply,
construction and erection of:
(a) medium and low voltage lines;
(b) substations;
(c) distribution transformers and equipment;
(d)  three phase and single phase connections; and
(e) the replacement of old electricity meters (about 8,000).
In addition, the proposed Project would provide funds for:
(a) consulting services for Project engineering and construction
supervision;
(b) consulting services for the implementation of the second phase of the
FRP;
(c) the construction of a meter laboratory in Sana'a;
(d) the hiring of experts/advisers (para. 2.19); and
(e) implementing the recommendations of the BC and ESB reports regarding
training in Yemen and abroad (paras. 2.18 and 2.19).
Detailed lists of required materials and contract packages are given in
Annex 3.1.
3.06     Project Cost Estimates.  The estimated cost of the proposed Project
is YRls 451.5 million (US$58.9 million), of which YRls 361.4 million (US$47.2
million) would be in foreign exchange. The cost estimates do not include
customs duties and taxes from which YGEC is exempt. The breakdown of the
Project cost is suimarized below while Annexes 3.2 and 3.3 give the yearly
Project cost estimates.

3.07     The base cost estimates of the proposed Project are expressed in
December 1985 prices and were developed by Lahmeyer International based on the
US Dollar equivalent prices quoted on contracts for equipment and materials to
be delivered for ongoing projects. The project cost estimates were expressed
in Yemeni Rials using the exchange rate prevailing at the time of appraisal.
Physical contingencies of 10X are considered appropriate due to the
flexibility in covering a smaller or larger part of the target Project areas.
Annual price contingencies for the local cost components have been calculated
at 101 for 1986, 8Z for 1987 through 1990, and 5; for 1991 and 1992. For the
foreign cost components, price contingencies have been calculated at 7.5X for
1986, 81 for 1987 through 1990, and 5.0X for 1991 and 1992. Based on the
Regional power subsector project implementation profile the proposed Project
is expected to be implemented over 7 years (1986-1992). However, if YGEC
demonstrates diligence and avoids past mistakes, the Project could be
completed by 1990 at a saving of about US$3.5 million.
3.08     Status of Project Preparation.  In 1983, YGEC engaged Labmeyer
International to conduct a feasibility study for the connection of large towns
and villages to the national grid. This study was submitted to IDA for review
and following the Association's comments was revised in early 1985. A
supplementary report was issued in December 1985, following the comments made
by the AFESD during their appraisal in November 1985. The revised study and
supplementary report were reviewed by IDA and found satisfactory. Thus the
areas to be supplied with electricity service under the proposed Project have
been identified on the basis of the revised study and supplementary report,
and the Project design constitutes the least cost solution for providing
electricity service to these areas.
3.09     Through Credits 837-YAR, 1102-YAR and 1361-YAR materials, network
designs , and procurement procedures have been standardized. Thus, the
general conditions for tendering, the technical specifications for materials
and equipment, and the network designs used under these Credits would be used
for the proposed Project. The materials required to implement the proposed
Project have been estimated by Lahmeyer International. However, the
preliminary designs contained in their study need to be reviewed and
developed, and bidding documents need to be completed in order to enable
execution of the Project to start as soon as possible after Credit approval.
For this work, and for completing the bidding process up to contracts award,
YGEC will use Lahmeyer International. The consulting firm is currently in the
field and is involved in the implementation of the Stage III Project which
involves the construction of the AM power plant and associated transmission
lines and substations.
3.10     Construction Supervision.  Although YGEC 's capabilities have
improved substantially in the last five years, they are still inadequate for
YGEC to supervise Project construction. Thus, services for construction
supervision would be required in the proposed Project and it is estimated that
such a contract would require about 200 man-months at a total cost of about
US$2.7 million (at US$13,500/man-months), of which about US$2.3 million would
be in foreign exchange. In order to ensure timely appointment of these
consultants, YGEC agreed during negotiations to hire by June 30, 1987



- 17 -
consultants acceptable to the Association on terms and conditions satisfactory
to the Association for construction supervision of facilities financed under
the proposed Project.
3.11     Proiect Implementation and Reporting.  Construction of the proposed
Project would be undertaken through three supply and erection contracts (one
for each of the project areas). Given the pressing needs for training and the
greater success experienced with practical training, the engineering
construction firms would also provide on-the-job training to YGEC's staff. To
ensure successful implementation of the training component, the construction
contracts would include a specific provision covering training. The total
base cost of the supply and erection contracts is estimated at about US$35.8
million, of which about US$28.5 million would be in foreign exchange. The
project implementation schedule is given in Annex 3.4.
3.12     The existing Project Unit in the distribution department of YGEC
established under Credit 1102-YAR would also be responsible for coordinating
and supervising all activities associated with the proposed Project. In
addition, the Project Unit, assisted by the consultant supervising the
construction of project facilities, will prepare and submit to IDA quarterly
progress reports and a project completion report.
3.13     Procurement.  Except for contracts financed by BITS which would be
let through competitive bidding limited to Swedish firms, all other major
contracts would be let through international competitive bidding (ICB).
Except as indicated below, contracts financed under the proposed Credit,
whether they relate to the supply of equipment and materials, or the erection
and installation of Project facilities, would be let through ICB in accordance
with the Bank Group guidelines for procurement. Procurement of small
quantities of standard distribution equipment and materials, not exceeding the
equivalent of US$100,000 per contract and the equivalent of US$400,000 in
aggregate, would be procured through limited international bidding (LIB)
procedures on the basis of bids invited from a list of potential suppliers
broad enough to assure competitive prices. All contracts to be financed from
the proceeds of the Credit, with the exception of those valued US$100,000 or
less would be reviewed by IDA prior to award. Contracts for consultancy
services and financed by IDA would be let in accordance with the Bank Group
Guidelines for Use of Consultants.
3.14     The allocations proposed above show that out of the total investment
cost (excluding technical assistance and training) of US$52.3 million,
procurement through ICB would account for US$37.9 million, through reserved
procurement US$14.0 million, and through LIB US$400,000. The financing by IDA
of these procurement items would be US$7.8 million under ICB, US$400,000 under
LIB, and US$3.5 million for consultancy services and training. The proposed
procurement plans are summarized below:

3.15     Disbursement.  Disbursement from the proceeds of the proposed credit
would be made for: (i) lOOZ of total costs associated with the construction
of the meter laboratory, the Financial Recovery Plan consultancy contract, and
training; (ii) 100X of foreign expend'tures for equipment, materials and
erection associated with the supply and erection contract for Area 3 and the
purchase of electricity meters; and (iii) 50t of foreign expenditures
associated with the construction supervision consultancy contract. With the
exception of contracts valued at equivalent US$50,000 or less all withdrawal
applications will be fully documented. Withdrawal applications for contracts
valued at less than US$50,000 equivalent will be submitted on the bases of
Stastement of Expenditure (SOE). Documentation to support disbursements
against SOE's will be retained by the YGEC who will prepare and submit to IDA
all withdrawal applications. This documentation in addition to being held for
one year after the Credit Closing Date, will be audited by auditors acceptable
to IDA, correlated with the relevant withdrawal application and made available
for review by IDA representatives upon request. To avoid delay in Project
execution due to lack of funds the Government agreed to open and maintain in
dollars a Special Account (Revolving Fund Account) of US$500,000 in its
Central Bank on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Association.



- 19 -
3.16     Retroactive Financing and Advanced Contracting:  Since in 1985 YGEC
hired a consulting firm acceptable to IDA to prepare the feasibility study and
the bidding documents up to and including contracts award, and since funds for
training would be required prior to the credit becoming effective, retroactive
financing of up to US$500,000 would be required to cover incurred training and
consultancy expenses.
3.17     Environmental Aspects.  The Project has no adverse pollution effects
on the environment. Possible adverse aesthetic effects would be kept to a
minimum by suitable routing of overhead lines.  The social environment and the
quality of life will be enhanced by bringing electricity service and street
lighting to the residential areas affected, and by eliminating the presently
existing hazardous networks.
3.18     Risks.  There are no major risks associated with the proposed
Project. -However, possible risks that could have an adverse impact on the ROR
on the investment relate to delays which may be experienced in implementing
the Project, and the uncertainty surrounding the load forecast and projected
electricity sales. To reduce to the extent possible the impact cf
implementation delays, the Project cost estimates (including contingencies)
have been derived on the basis of the Regional power subsector project
implementation profile which indicates completion in 7 years; however, a
project similar to the proposed could be completed within 5 years. Regarding
electricity sales anticipated to result from the proposed Project, the load
forecast was derived on very conservative assumptions. However, the
sensitivity analysis indicates that with sales growth forecast reduced by 10%,
the proposed Project is still economically viable. It is therefore considered
that any impact on the return of the Project stemming from the above-mentioned
risks would be small.

IV. FINANCE
4.01     Introduction.  YGEC's accounting and financial department has
deteriorated during the past three years. The experienced seconded expatriate
financial manager and the internal auditor returned to their homeland in 1983
and were replaced with inexperienced local staff. The utility accounting
system recommended by Peat, Marwick, Mitchell & Co. (PMM - UK consultants) and
followed to that date by YGEC, was discontinued and replaced by a Government
prescribed uniform system of accounts which is inadequate for electric utility
operations. Technical assistance under IDA Credit 1361-YAR for the first
phase of the FRP provided consultants (ESB) to investigate the problem .nd
prepare recaomendations for strengthening YGEC's accounting and financial
department (para. 4.03).
4.02     Financial Department.  Certain irregularities and misappropriations
of funds were discovered in 1983. However, no IDA funds were involved in the
irregularities and misappropriations, and all funds have since been
recovered. This resulted in the replacement of the Financial Director, the
Chief Accountant and other accounting staff with inexperienced persons, due to
the lack of qualified and experienced utility accountants in YAR. The present
Financial Director has a degree in accounting and about five years' experience
with a local Yemeni bank; his assistant is also experienced only in bank
accounting. The newly appointed Financial Director was sent to Ireland for
about three months' on-the-job training, but this limited training cannot
replace the required years of utility accounting experience. ESB was
therefore requested by YGEC to provide an expatriate senior utility accountant
financed by IDA for one year to act on a daily basis in an advisory/training
capacity. A qualified person has been selected and he is currently installed
in Sana'a. In addition to the senior accountant-trainer, ESB recommended the
hiring of two qualified expatriate adviser-trainer accountants; one to be
assigned to the Sana'a regional office and the other to serve the remaining
regions and regional stores. YGEC is presently negotiating with ESB and the
Jordanian Electricity Authority for securing the two additional recommended
accountant-trainers who would ue financed under the training component of
Credit 1361-YAR. In addition, YGEC is currently contemplating hiring the two
expatriates who were working with the utility until 1983 (para. 4.01).
4.03     Accounts.  Under Credit 1361-YAR YGEC is required to formulate and
implement the FRP discussed in para7. 4.08. The terms of reference for Phase I
of this plan provide for the review of YGEC's accounts and financial
reporting. ESB have finished their review and their recommendations for the
implementation of new accounting procedures for the head and regional offices
are expected tc be finalized about the first quarter of 1986. The
recommendations include:
(a)  job descriptions for all financial, accounting, internal auditing,
store operator, credit controller, consumer administration, meter
reader, and debt collection personnel;
(b)  recommended training programs for above-mentioned personnel;
(c)  reimplementation of the PMM reconmended utility accounting system;



- 21 -
(d) budgetary control incorporating a work order system;
(e) financial planning for short, medium and long term;
(f)  implementation of a computer billing program;
(g) computerization of stores accounting, payroll and, in time, of all
accounting; and
(h) reorganization of accounting and financial responsibilities to
achieve proper operation of the department.
Implementation of the consultant's recommendations is a very large undertaking
and will require considerable effort by both the consultant and YGEC. A time
frame for implementing all the recommendations is about five years. Under
this Projet implementation of the second phase of the FRP will be supported
(para. 3.02).
4.04     Revenue Covenant.  Under Credit 837-YAR, YGEC was required to earn an
8S rate of return on revalued assets, starting in fiscal year 1979/1980.
During appraisal of the Regional Electrification Project (Credit 1102-YAR),
electricity sales were about 141 lower than the earlier projections because of
the constraivts experienced by YGEC in connecting the anticipated number of
new consumers and YGEC did not meet the target. In view of these difficulties
and the already relatively high electricity tariffs, the rate of return target
vas revised under Credit 1102-YAR to a minimum of 31 for 1981-1983, 51 for
1984, 6S for 1985, and 8S for 1986 and thereafter. During 1981 the Government
decided to remove all fuel subsidies in one step instead of reducing the fuel
subsidies gradually as covenanted. Because electricity tariffs were high
(above IMRC), the Government felt that an increase in tariffs commensurate
with the resulting fuel price increase was not politically feasible. However,
the abrupt increase in fuel prices had a devastating effect on YGEC's
financial performance, and YGEC was unable to achieve the revised financial
targets under Credit 1102-YAR. Taking into consideration that the abrupt
removal of fuel subsidies rendered the financial targets set under Credit
1102-YAR unrealistic and unattainable, the revenue covenants were again
revised under Credit 1361-YAR. Accordingly, YGEC had to cover at least 90S of
its operating costs in FY 1984, break even in FY 1985, and achieve a return on
revalued assets of not less than 31 in FY 1986 through 1988, 51 in FY 1989, 61
in FY 1990, and 81 in FY 1991 and thereafter. Under the proposed Credit, the
Government and YGEC agreed to take all measures that would enable YGEC to
achieve a rate of return on revalued assets of not less than 31 in FY 1986
through 1988, 51 in FY 1989, 61 in FY 1990, and 81 in FY 1991 and thereafter.
4.05     Past Performance and Present Position.  YGEC's actual income
statements and balance sheets for the fiscal years ended December 31, 1982 and
1983 and unaudited financial statements for 1984 are presented in Annexes 4.1
and 4.2. YGEC sustained net operating losses (before debt service) of about
YRls 17 million in 1982, YRls 19 million in 1983, and YRls 85 million in
1984. Government equity contributions of YRls 620 million were required for
YGEC to meet its operating losses and construction requirements during the
years 1982-84, placing a very heavy financial burden on the Government. The
operating losses in 1983 and 1984 were mainly due to the increased fuel bill



- 22 -
stemming from the devaluation of the YR1 and the absence of comparable
increases in electricity tariffs which were already well above LRMC.  Although
under Credit 1361-YAR the Government has agreed to introduce a fuel adjustment
clause in the electricity bill, the Council of Ministers felt that an increase
in tariffs, even in the form of a fuel adjustment to offset the fuel bill
increase was not politically feasible, and much more so since the
international price of fuel was declining and YAR had announced the discovery
of oil.
4.06     In 1984 YGEC's projections indicated that the corporation would fail
to meet the revised financial targets unless certain financial measures were
introduced. Thus in March 1985 the Government decided to allow YGEC to
purchase its fuel oil requirements from the free market instead of the
compulsory purchase from the Yemen Oil and Mineral Resources Corporation and
introduced the following revenue measures:
(a) a monthly service charge to all domestic, commercial, and low-voltage
industrial consumers ranging from YRls 15 to YRls 250;
(b) a monthly capacity charge of YRls 5 per kVA of reserved capacity to
all large commercial and industrial consumers charged at the rate of
Rls 1.1/kWh, and YRls 10 per kVA to all other large consumers
charged at a rate less than YRls 1.1/kWh; and
(c) an increase in connection charges by an average of about 50Z from
February 3, 1985 for new consumers.
The combined effect of the above actions is estimated to increase YGEC's
revenues by about 19% in 1985 and by about 25X from 1986 onwards. It is
estimated that with this substantial revenue increase, YGEC would be able to
meet the financial covenants under Credit 1361-YAR through 1987. The
Government, while discussing the package that was to improve YGEC's financial
position, found no grounds for introducing the fuel adjustment clause at this
time, since YGEC's current fuel bill after the permission to purchase fuel
from the free market and the fuel cost (based on fuel oil-diesel mix)
projected for 1985 represents a smaller share (42.6X compared to 46.3X) of the
utility's operating expenses than it did in 1983.
4.07     Accounts Receivable.  Under the existing credits, YGEC is required to
ensure that its accounts receivable for electricity supply do not exceed 60
days' billings. As of December 31, 1984, YGEC's accounts receivable for
electricity amounted to YRis 102 million (about 112 days' billings). The
major reason for the large receivables is the manual preparation of
electricity bills which is slow and results in collection delays. A separate
group of consultants is presently working to computerize the billing operation
and it is expected that YGEC would begin processing customer bills on the
computer beginning with FY 1987. YGEC agreed to repeat the existing accounts
receivable covenant under the proposed Credit.
4.08     Financial Recovery Plan.  One of the most important features of
Credit 1361-YAR was the introduction of the FRP for YGEC (para. 4.03). The
FRP is very broad in scope, consisting of programs to reduce system losses, a
series of measures encompassing all managerial aspects (planning, personnel



- 23 -
and finance) including a comprehensive training program, the timely planning
and implementation of adequate tariff adjustments, and cost reductions and
controls. The plan is to be implemented over two phases: (i) covering the
period up to July 1987 for recommending and implementing assistance in
organization, management, finance, accounting and stores management, study of
operating costs, and manpower planning and training; and (i) covering the
period up to July 1990 for implementing training and organization changes
required for YGEC's staff to take over from the expatriate staff the total
operations of YGEC. The contract for the second phase is estimated to require
about 110 man-months at a total cost of about US$1.37 million (US$12,500 per
man-month), of which about US$1.1 million would be in foreign exchange.
4.09     Because of delays in meeting the effectiveness conditions of Credit
1361-YAR, the appointment of ESB was delayed almost 18 months. However, the
consultants are progressing satisfactorily with the studies and are in the
process of preparing their recommendations (para. 4.03). During negotiations
YGEC agreed to hire, the latest by June 30. 1987, consultants acceptable to
IDA, under terms and conditions also acceptable to IDA, to carry out the
second phase of the FRP.
4.10     Future Financial Performance.  Projected financial statements are
presented in Annexes 4.1 through 4.3. The introduction of monthly service
charges and capacity charges (para. 4.06) would enable YGEC to increase
revenues sufficiently to meet the 3X rate of return covenant (para 4.04) for
the years 1986 and 1987. However, beginning in 1988, some Government action
to strengthen YGEC's finances either through an increase in revenues or
through some other cost reducing measures would be required. 1/ The need for,
or the extent of, these measures would depend on the rate of growth of
electricity sales after 1987. The assumptions used for preparing the
financial forecasts for the years 1985 through 1993 are presented in Annex
4.4.
4.11     Revaluation of Assets was agreed under the previous Credits and
should protect YGEC from future inflation and further devaluation of the
Yemeni Rial by providing increased annual depreciation. YGEC agreed to repeat
the covenant under the proposed credit whereby YGEC would revalue assets in
any year in which the indices of the "Unit Value of Manufactured Exports from
Developed to Developing Countries" for the foreign cost of assets and the
"Consumer Price Index" for the local costs have increased by more than 15S
since the date of the last revaluation.
4.12     As Government plays a major role in YGEC's financial matters, in
order to monitor YGEC's future financial performance, the Government and YGEC
agreed to the following:
1/ Increase in revenues or reduction in costs which would enable YGEC to meet
the rate of return covenants may come through any combination of the
following: reduced cost of fuel oil, substitution of domestic gas for
imported fuel oil, individual tariff increases, increases of sales over
forecasts, further reduction of losses, and possibly strengthening of the
Yemeni Rial vis-a-vis the US dollar.



- 24 -
(a) before September 30, 1986 for FY 1987 and prior to September 30
preceding each following fiscal year, YGEC shall review with the
Government the adequacy of YGEC's revenues to achieve, on the basis
of realistic forecasts, the agreed return for the following years;
and
(b) on the basis of this review, determine the measures to achieve the
agreed return, and consult with the Association on the measures and
on the implementation schedule for these measures before the
beginning of the following fiscal year.
4.13     YGEC's Expansion Program Financing Plan.  YGEC's projected sources
and applications of funds for the period 1985-1993 are presented in Annex
4.3. YGEC's debt service, balance of ongoing loans, the proposed Credit and
the proposed loans are stated at current and projected exchange rates which
average about 60X increase over the previously YRls 4.54 to US$1 used in the
appraisal of Credit 1361-YAR. Consequently the debt service associated with
the ongoing projects, including the AM power plant, is about 88X of YGEC's
projected net internal cash generation from net operating income and
depreciation. However, improvement of debt service coverage is noted from
0.79 in 1986 to 1.53 in 1991. Excluding the proposed Credit of SDR 10.9
million (about US$11.7 million), YGEC would have to borrow long term about
US$46.7 million to finance 421 of its expansion program estimated at a total
of US$201.7 million. It should be noted that under the proposed financing
plan no Government equity contributions towards future projects would be
required after 1987. A su-nmry of the 1986-1993 financing plan of YGEC's
expansion program is given below:

4.14     Project Financing Plan.  During project preparation the Government
informed IDA that the AFESD, the Islamic Development Bank (IDB), CIDA
(Canada), SIDA (Sweden) and the Dutch International Aid had indicated interest
in co-financing the proposed 7roject. The Association confirmed the interest
of the above institutions and agencies and kept them abreast with the
preparation of the proposed Project. However, in July 1985 the Dutch
International Aid informed IDA that presently it cannot participate in the
financing of the proposed project, while CIDA indicated that its participation
would be nominal, about US$2 million, and would probably be associated with
training. Thus, excluding IDA, the only possible sources of co-financing for
the proposed project were the AFESD, the IDB under its installment
arrangement, and the Swedish Agency for International Technical and Economic
Co-operation (BITS) under the Swedish concessionary credit system.
4.15     A co-financiers' meeting held in Sana'a from October 23 through 24,
1985, was attended only by representatives of the AFESD and IDA. The AFESD.
not having yet appraised the proposed project, reaffirmed its interest and
suggested another meeting be held around mid-January 1986, following their
appraisal.
4.16     In November 1985 a Yemeni delegation visited Sweden and agreement was
reached for Swedish participation (through BITS) in the proposed project to an
amount equivalent of US$10.5 million.
4.17     The second co-financiers' meeting held in Paris from January 16
through 17, 1986, was attended by representatives of IDB, AFESD, BITS, YGEC,
Government and IDA. The delegate of BITS announced that the Board of BITS had
approved a credit to the amount of US$10.5 million equivalent, on
concessionary terms (para. 4.21); the credit amount was subsequently (telex of
January 30, 1986) increased to US$11.1 million equivalent. The delegates of
AFESD, IDB and IDA reaffirmed the participation of their respective
institutions to the amounts listed below, subject to the approval of their
Board of Directors. Thus, the financing plan for the proposed project is as
follows:
US$ Million Equivalent
Local       Foreign        Total
BITS                                 -           11.1          11.1

Total                           11.7         47.2          58.9
A condition of Credit effectiveness is the completion of all arrangements,
satisfactory to the Association, to secure loans and credits in an aggregate
amount equivalent to US$36.1 million.



- 27 -
4.18     During the second co-financiers' meeting it was agreed that:  (i) IDB
would finance the foreign exchange cost of most equipment and materials
associated with the supply and erection contract for Area 1; (ii) the AFESD
would finance the foreign exchange cost associated with the remaining
equipment and materials, and the erection portion of the contract for Area 1,
one-half of the foreign exchange cost associated with the construction
supervision consultancy contract, and the cost of the expert assistance; (iii)
BITS would finance the foreign exchange cost associated with the supply and
erection contract for Area 2; and (iv) IDA would finance the items mentioned
in paragraph 3.15.
4.19     Debt Service Coverage.  Under Credit 1361-YAR, it was agreed that
YGEC shall obtain the Association's prior approval for any long-term borrowing
unless its net revenues for each year during the term of the debt (before
depreciation and interest) is at least equal to 1.5 times the projected debt
service requirements for such year, on all its debt, including the debt to be
incurred. On such a basis, YGEC's debt service coverage ratio during 1987-93
(after the implementation of the Financial Recovery Plan) is projected to be
0.53 in 1987, 0.65 in 1988, 1.10 in 1989, 1.22 in 1990, 1.31 in 1991, 1.24 in
1992 and 1.20 in 1993, which would require the Association's prior approval
before YGEC would undertake any additional debt. In order that YGEC may raise
quickly the funds required for the planned construction program, it may be
permitted to borrow in the period through 1993, for the exclusive purpose of
construction, amounts not to exceed the equivalent of US$1.0 million per
year. YGEC agreed to a debt limitation covenant similar to that included in
Credit 1361-YAR for borrowings exceeding the equivalent of US$1.0 million.
4.20     Lending Arrangement.  Government agreed that the proposed Credit of
SDRs 10.9 million made to the Government shall be on-lent to YGEC. The terms
for the on-lending arrangement shall be 20 years, including a 5-year grace
period and a rate of interest of 9Z. The Government shall bear the foreign
exchange risk on the loan.
4.21     The terms of the loans and credits secured from BITS, IDB and AFESD
are as follows:
(a)  the effective rate of interest of the BITS credit is 3% of the
principle outstanding as of the date of plant commissioning, and it
is payable over the principle amortization period of 10 years;
(b) the IDB installment arrangement carries a return of 8S on the value
of goods and is repayable over at most 14 semiannual installments
with the first payment due 6 months after delivery of goods; and
(c)  the AFESD loan is made to the Government at a rate of interest of 47
and is repayable over 16 years, including a grace period of 5 years.
4.22     Auditing.  The independent auditor's report of YGEC FY1982 accounts
submitted in September 1983 was unacceptable to YGEC, the Government and the
Association. In 1985 Saba & Co., in association with Touche Ross of London,
were appointed by YGEC as independent auditors to audit the accounts for
FY1982, 1983 and 1984. The audit of the FY1982 and 1983 accounts was



- 28 -
completed in May 1985 and the auditors gave only qualified statements for
FY1982 and 1983. The audit for 1984 was completed in March 1936 and restated
the accounts for FY1982 and 1983 and, due to the poor accounting practices and
lack of accounting controls, continued to carry qualifications. To remedy the
problems YGEC, in conjunction with the Government, has undertaken to devise
and implement a plan satisfactory to the auditors and the Association by:
(i) devising in consultation with the auditors and ESB, a program to institute
appropriate internal control systems; (ii) submitting by June 30, 1986 for
IDA's review a program for addressing the deficiencies; and (iii) initiating
by September 30, 1986 the implementation of the program agreed between YGEC,
the auditors and IDA. Under the existing credits, YGEC is required to submit
to IDA its annual financial statements, audited by independent auditors
acceptable to the Association, within 6 months after the end of each fiscal
year. The present audit arrangements under which Saba & Co. have been
retained by YGEC are acceptable. Although there have been delays in
submission of audited accounts in past years, the implementation of the
consultant's recommendations under the FRP are expected to enable YGEC to
submit its audited accounts within the prescribed 6 months after the end of FY
1986, and YGEC agreed to repeat the existing audit covenant under the proposed
Credit.
4.23     Insurance . YGEC insures its assets against the usual hazards of
fire, explosion, etc, through the Marib Insurance Company, which reinsures
with Lloyds of London. Under the existing Credits, the insurance coverage
requires annual inspection of plant and equipment by qualified inspectors to
ensure that YGEC complies with sound public utility practices. YGEC's
insurance coverage is considered adequate and YGEC agreed to extend such
insurance coverage to the facilities constructed under the project.

V. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
A. Electricity Demand
5.01     Electricity consumption in the towns of Ibb, Dhamar. Rada'a and Yarim
has grown over the last three years at an average annual rate of about 45Z
compared to the overall YGEC average of about 24X. This extremely high growth
rate is mostly a result of the high number of new consumer connections which
by December 1984. had brought the level of urban population with public
electricity service to about 86X. Although there is still a potential demand
for electricity in these towns, the unavoidable consequence of the high growth
rate is that the existing 33/11 kV substations and 11 kV network are
overloaded contributing significantly to the low reliability and high losses
of the system. To overcome these problems a ring connection will be built
under the proposed project (para. 3.02).
5.02     The smaller towns and villages included in the proposed Project do
not have YGEC supply; only a few private generating sets exist. Thus the
population with electricity supply currently ranges from zero to about 201.
5.03     Future demand for electricity in the Project area is based on past
trends in consumption, connection rates (where YGEC supply already exist)
demographic factors, and level of economic activity. An average population
growth rate of 2.31 per annum has been assumed. As the traditional average
family size tends to decline, it is expected that the growth rate of the
number of households will exceed the natural gr,wth rate of population, with
higher growth rates expected in the larger towns. Based on these assumptions,
specific consumption of domestic consumers to 1994 is expected to increase at
an annual average rate of about 6% in the larger towns and about 81 in the
smaller towns and villages, and to drop to about 4X on the average from 1995
onwards. Thus total electricity demand at the 33 kV supply points is forecast
to increase in the period 1986 to 1991 at an average annual rate of about 17Z
(from 34 GWh to about 73 GWh) compared to an annual average growth rate of
about 81 for the entire YGEC system over the same period.
B. Least Cost
5.04     The proposed Project is a continuation of the previous two IDA
projects (Credits 1102-YAR and 1361-YAR) which were derived from the urban
distribution program prepared by K & D and the National Electrification
Program prepared in 1981 by the National Rural Electric Cooperation
Association (NRECA). These programs have been designed to be implemented over
successive phases, where each phase considered on its own merit, would
represent the least-cost alternative for extending electricity service to the
beneficiaries. The proposed Project offers the least-cost means of extending
electricity supply in the areas affected by the Project. In the case of the
towns of Ibb, Dbamar, Rada'a and Yarim which were temporary connected to the
132 kV grid in early 1984, the only option of extending the electricity
service



- 30 -
provided by YGEC is to permanently connect these towns to the national grid
and appropriately reinforce the distribution systems. The design of the
proposed Project achieves this objective at least cost.
5.05     In order to provide electricity service to the smaller towns and
villages included in the proposed Project it was necessary to compare the
incremental economic cost of supply from the grid, to the incremental economic
cost of supply from isolated diesel stations. The analysis indicates that,
with the exception of the Al Beida area (including Al Fara and Al Mantaqe) the
least-cost solution involves the extension and reinforcement of the
interconnected system. As for the Al Beida area, the least-cost solution
involves the reinforcement of the distribution system of the isolated diesel
station at Al Beida, and the installation of a new isolated diesel station at
Al Fara and Al Mantaqe using 560 kVA engines. A summary of the least cost
analysis is provided below while details are given in Annex 5.2.

C. Return on Investment
5.06     The rate of return (ROR) of the Project was first calculated with
benefits measured as revenues at existing tariffs and consumers'
contributions. An adjusted rate of return (AROR) was then calculated for the
Project taking consumers' surplus as an additional project benefit to reflect
total consumers' willingness to pay for electricity. The ROR was estimated at
16% and the AROR at 16.4X, compared to the opportunity cost of capital to YAR
of 12X. This indicates the adequacy of tariffs in relation to the economic
cost of supply. The rate of return was estimated on the basis of quantifiable
costs and benefits expressed in mid 1985 prices. Costs consisted of capital
(including physical contingencies), fixed operation and maintenance and the



- 31 -
system's economic cost of supplying a kilowatt-hour to the final consumer.
Benefits were measured as incremental sales at existing rural average
electricity rate of YRls 1.66/kWh (US$0.22/kWh) and incremental revenues from
consumer contributions. Consumer surplus was calculated on the basis that a
consumer would ultimately be willing to pay the price for private supply to
avoid interruption in electricity supply (Annex 5.2).
5.07     Rate of return analyses were also performed for each cluster of
villages situated around the towns of Dhamar, Hababah, Sanhan, and Al Beida.
These analyses indicate that the rates of return on the investments associated
with these clusters range from 1 to 30S (see Project File).
5.08     Sensitivity analyses were made by:  (i) increasing the capital cost
of the Project by 101; and (ii) reducing the sales of electricity by 10 and
20Z. The results indicate that the AROR is relatively more sensitive to
changes in electricity sales than to changes in capital cost. A 101 decrease
in sales revenue results in an AROR of about 122 compared to an AROR of about
15S with a 101 increase in capital cost. Under the worst and most unlikely
scenario of 202 reduction in incremental sales revenue, the AROR would fall to
about 71 which is below the opportunity cost of capital (Annex 5.2).

VI. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMDWMATION
6.01     The Government agreed to:
(a) relend the proceeds of the proposed credit to YGEC through a
subsidiary loan agreement at an interest rate of 92 p.a. over a
20-year repayment period inclusive of a 5-year grace period.
Government shall bear the foreign exchange risk on the loan (para.
4.20); and
(b) open and maintain in dollars a special account of US$500,000 in its
Central Bank on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Association
(para. 3.15).
6.02     The Government and YGEC agreed to:
(a) take all measures that would enable YGEC to achieve a rate of return
on revalued assets of not less than 3Z in FY 1986 through 1988, 5Z in
FY 1989, 62 in FY 1990, and 8S in FY 1991 and thereafter (para.
4.04); and
(b) the following:
(i) before September 30, 1986 for FY 87 and prior to September 30 of
each year following fiscal years beginning FY 86, YGEC shall
review with the Government the adequacy of YGEC's revenues to
achieve, on the basis of realistic forecasts, the agreed return
for the following fiscal years (para. 4.12); and
(ii) on the basis of this review, determine the measures to achieve
the agreed return, and consult with the Association on the
measures and on the implementation schedule for these measures
before the beginning of the following fiscal year (para. 4.12);
6.03     YGEC agreed to:
(a) hire by June 30, 1987 consultants acceptable to the Association for
construction supervision of Project facilities (para. 3.10);
(b)  the existing covenant regarding management of receivables under the
existing credit being repeated under the proposed credit (para 4.07);
(c) hire by June 30, 1987, consultants acceptable to IDA to carry out the
second phase of the Financial Recovery Plan (para. 4.09);
(d) revalue assets in any year in which the indices of the "Unit Value of
Manufactured Exports from Developed to Developing Countries" and the
"Consumer Price Index" has increased by more than 152 since the date
of the last revaluation (para. 4.11);



- 33 -
(e)  a debt limitation covenant similar to that included in Credit
1361-YAR for borrowings exceeding the equivalent of US$1.0 million
(para. 4.19);
(f)  repeat the audit covenant under Credit 8376-YAR, 1102-YAR, and
1361-YAR in the proposed credit (para. 4.22); and
(g)  the covenants relating to insurance under Credits 1102-YAR and
1361-YAR being repeated in the proposed credit (para. 4.23);
6.04     With the assurances listed above, the Project would provide a
suitable basis for an IDA Credit of US$11.7 million equivalent on the standard
terms. The conditions for Credit effectiveness would be the:
(a)  execution of the subsidiary Loan Agreement;
(b)  ratification of the Project Agreement between YGEC and the
Association; and
(c)  completion of all arrangements, satisfacto.y to the Association, to
secure loan(s) and/or credit(s) from other co-financiers in an
aggregate amount equivalent to US$36.1 million (para. 4.17).
The Credit is expected to become effective within 90 days of signing.

YEMEN ARAB REPUBLIC
FOURTH POWER PROJECT
Summary of BC's Training Recommendations
Dhaban Training Center
The courses for young people should all incorporate periods of
integrated on-job training so that trainees are prepared for specific
types of post.
Short courses should be provided for new recruits and existing staff
in specific topics.
A basic skills training course should be provided for all recruits
for maintenance work.
An audio-visual package on the principles of electricity generation
should be prepared.
Steam Generating Stations
Instruction in the principles of electricity generation should be
provided either at Dhaban Training Center or by the use of an
audio-visual package at Ras Katenib and Al Mukha.
An additional training engineer should be appointed at Ras Katenib,
and of the two, one should specialise in operations training and the
other in maintenance training. This will be for the training of both
Ras Katenib and Al Mukha staff.
An operator training simulator be provided at Al Mukha.
YGEC Students in Great Britian
Provided that satisfactory examination results are achieved without
repeats of study, students should be allowed to proceed to the
highest qualification that they can achieve (up to first degree
level). .
Students should be interviewed twice by a YGEC representative during
their course and their work and course preferences aligned with the
manpower requirements of YGEC.

Yage Z ot 3
On completion of the educational course, the student should then
undertake 9 months specialised training with an electricity board in
Great Britian to prepare him for the post that he will be appointed
to with YGEC.
Students should be concentrated at a very small number of technical
colleges for electricity supply orientated TEC Diploma and Higher
Diploma courses.
Manpower
The balance between manpower supply and demand is shown visually in
the table following these recommendations.
Arrangements are made as soon as possible to meet the Planning
Engineer and Instrument Maintenance Engineer needs at Ras Katenib.
The planned recruitment level of technicians for Al Mukha is carried
out.
Transmission
The posts for engineers in Substations, Protection and
Telecommunications to be filled as soon as possible.
Contact to be established with the Institute of Telecommunications
(Ministry of Telecommunications) regarding the training of
telecommunications engineers.
The recruitment of linesmen and substation operators and maintenance
fitters is carried out.
Dis tribut ion
Dhaban Training Center should recruit an annual intake of 5
technicians in 1986, and 20 in 1987, 1988 and 1989.
Commercial
Dhabar. Training Center should recruit an annual intake of 5
technicians 1986, 15 in 1987 and 10 in 1988 and 1989.
General
An attempt should be made to recruit qualified Yemeni engineers now
training in Great Britain.
In the interests of manpower economy existing staff should be
redeployed into vacancies whenever possible.

ANNEX 4.4

YEMEN ARAB REPUBLIC
FOURrH POWER PROJECT
Yemen General Electricity Corporation
Notes and Assumptions for Financial Forecasts
A. General
1.       All financial forecasts are given for the fiscal years of YGEC
beginning January 1 and ending December 31. In addition to its power utility
operations, YGEC is engaged in small water supply operations in Al Beida and
Hajjah. Exchange rates used in the forecasts are as follows:
1985               US$1.00  =  YRls 7.50
1986               US$1.00  =  YRUs 7.59
1987 through 1993  US$1.00  =  YRls 7.67
B. Income Statement
2.       The forecasts assume annual kWh sales growth of 32.882 in 1985,
39.28% in 1986, 14.42% in 1987, 7.18% in 1988, 5.29Z in 1989, 9.92% in 1990,
8.98% in 1991, 5.34Z in 1992 and 4.73% in 1993.
3.       Average revenue per kWh is based on existing rates of YR1 1.1/kWh for
urban, YR1 1.5/kWh for rural and YRI 0.65/kWh for industrial and bulk supply
consumers. Service charges are based on monthly charges of YRls 15 to
YRls 250 for all domestic, commercial and low-voltage industrial consumers;
and monthly capacity charges of YRis 10 per kVA of reserved capacity to all
large commercial and industrial consumers.
4.       Increase in revenues or reduction in costs which would enable YGEC to
meet the rate of return covenants may come through any combination of the
following: reduction in the price of fuel oil, substitution of domestic gas
for imported fuel oil, individual tariff increases, increases of sales over
forecasts, further reduction of l?sses, and possibly strengthening of the
Yemeni Rial vis-a-vis the US Dollar.
5.       Salaries and wages are based on YGEC's forecasts and assume that
expatriates presently in many positions will be gradually replaced by Yemeni
staff.
6.       Fuel and lubricants are based on estimates of fuel consumption for
steam and diesel generating units. Fuel prices are projected at the YRI
exchange rate in effect each year. We assumed YRls 173/ton for the first 6
months of 1986, and 116 YRls/ton for the remaining 6 months; 106 YRls/tor. for
1987 increasing at 5X annually from 1988 through 1993.



- 62 -
ANNEX 4.4
Page 2 of 2
Maintenance charges are assumed to increase proportional to the
increase in fixed assets in service.
8.       Staff retirement now covered by Government plan.
9.       Depreciation rates conform to Government requirements and computed
using the straight-line method over the useful lives as follows:
Buildings                              50 years
Generating equipment                   12 to 25 years
Transmission and distribution          30 years
Vehicles                               5 to 8 years
Furniture and equipment                10 years
Tools and work equipment               4 years
10.      YGEC is exempt from income taxes.
11.      Interest expenses are calculated on YR1 exchange rate at time
interest is due.
C. Balance Sheet
12.      Gross fixed assets in service are carried by YGEC at historical
costs. However, for purposes of analyses, the forecasts have been made in
accordance with provisions of earlier Credit Agreement, at revalued costs.
13.      Inventories include a month's fuel and inventories equivalent to 2S
oif fixed assets.
14.      Accounts receivables are forecast on the equivalent of 2 months'
sales of electricity and on loans to employees based on forecasts by the
Corporation.
15.      Capital includes Government equity contributions and loans passed
through Government to YGEC as equity contributions without any formal
obligation of repayment by YGEC.
16.      Long-term debt is expressed in amounts equivalent to the foreign
exchange rate as of the end of each fiscal year.
17.      Accounts payable and accrued charges include one month's fuel costs
and salary expenses.

YEMEN ARAB REPUBLIC
FOURrH POWER PROJECT
Yemen General Electricity Corporation
Economic Analysis
A. Least-Cost Justification
1.       The project involves the reinforcement and the extension of the
existing distribution system in larger towns which are currently temporarily
connected to the YGEC national interconnected grid and the connection of small
towns and villages with and without YGEC isolated diesel generation to the
YGEC national interconnected grid.
2.       In the larger towns of Ibb and Dhamar with temporary connections to
the YGEC national grid, these temporary connections will be replaced with
permanent 11-kV lines. In addition, the weak 11-kV overhead lines (OHL) in
densely built-up areas which pose a danger to the population would be replaced
by underground cables. On the basis of load flow studies undertaken by
consultants, the loading and voltage drop in the distribution system in these
areas would reach critical levels by 1992. The 33-kV lines and substations
will be fully overloaded. The best solution, therefore, is to build
additional 33-kV substations to be tied to the li-kV systems near the
substations. This would relieve the network, reduce voltage drops, increase
reliability of supply, and allow for utilization of the existing equipment and
installations to their normal lifetime without modification or reinforcement.
The proposed reinforcement, which is based on detailed load flow studies,
provides the only means for reliable power supply in conformity with YGEC's
technical standards for its distribution system.
3.       For the smaller towns and villages, the least-cost justification was
established by comparing the incremental economic cost of extending the YGEC
interconnected grid to the towns and villages to the incremental economic cost
of isolated diesel generation. The results of analyses indicate that with the
exception of Al Bayda towns and villages extension of the YGEC interconnected
grid is the least-cost solution (para. 5).
4.       The main assumptions underlying the analyses are as follows:
(a) Grid Extension
(i) Capital Costs of grid extension were taken from project
cost tables (Annex 3.3) expressed in mid-1985 prices and in
economic terms to reflect their economic resource cost to
YAR. Capital costs include physical contingencies.

ANNEX 5.2

(ii) Fixed 0 & M were taken as 1% of capital costs based on
consultant's estimate.
(iii) Economic Cost of Supply was based on system's LRMC of
supply from the YGEC interconnected system of US$ 0.131/kWh
(YRls 0.97/kWh).
(b) Isolated Diesel Generation
(i) Capital Costs of installation of medium-speed diesels of
unit sizes ranging from 500 kW to 2.5 MW was assumed to be
about $1,000/kW.
(ii) Fixed 0 & M was assumed at 1.51 of capital cost.
(iii) Fuel Cost was based on economic cost of diesel fuel of
US$38.82/ 106 kilocalories and unit average heat rate of
2,220 kilocalories per kilowatt hour.
5.       Results of analysis for the seventy small towns and villages are
summarized in the table below.

Rate of Return
6.       The rate of return (ROR) of the project, as a whole, was estimated at
about 16.4%. The rate of return for the new market areas are as follows:

Al Beida town and villages   30%
The calculations are set out on pages 5 through 13 of this Annex. The main
assumptions underlying the analyses are presented below.
Capital Costs
7.       Capital costs, including physical contingencies and expressed in
mid-1985 prices, were taken from project cost tables in Annex 3.3.
Fixed Operation and Maintenance
8.       Annual fixed operation and maintenance costs were based on
consultant's estimates of 1Z of total capital costs.
Economic Cost of Supply
9.       Economic cost of supply from the main YGEC transmission system was
based on the long-run marginal cost (LRMC) of generation and transmission and
the short-run marginal fuel and variable costs. The economic cost of supply
was estimated as YRls 0.98/kWh (US0.131/kWh).
Benefits
10.      Benefits were measured as incremental net sales valued at the average
rural electricity price of YRls 1.66/kWh and the incremental revenue from
consumer contributions. However, this average price does not fully reflect
the benefits of electricity consumption in the rural areas where the price
paid for private supplies range from YRls 3.0/kWh (US$0.40/kWh) to YRls
4.3/kWh (US$0.573/kWh). In an attempt to capture the consumer surplus in
electricity consumption in rural areas, an estimate of the consumer surplus,
as a perceived consumers' willingness to pay, was added to the incremental
power sales revenue. The estimated consumer surplus is taken as a proxy for
the interfuel substitution that takes place, such as substitution of kerosene
for lighting, diesel fuel for private electricity generation and for use in
diesel operated pumps with the introduction of public electricity in the
Project area. The consumer surplus was calculated by the following formula:
1/2 (Qpublic - Qprivate) (Pprivate - Ppublic) x K
Where:
Qpublic    =  Average specific consumption of rural consumer on public supply
(1,000 kWh/year)
Qprivate   =  Average specific consumption of rural consumer on private supply
(240 kWh/year)

Pprivate   -  Price of private supply tYRla 3/kWh)
Ppublic    -  Average cost to a rural consumer of YGEC supply which includes
consumer contribution to investment. This is estimated at
YRls 1.92/kWh (wt. average price is YRIs 1.66/kWh).
K          -  Number of additional consumers per year.
11.      The benefits of improved reliability of supply, the multiplier effect
of increased economic and recreational activities, and reduction in
rural-urban migration attributable to the Project although not quantifiable
are to a certain extent reflected in the demand for electricity. Other
non-quantifiable benefits are noise and pollution reduction in areas with
isolated diesel generation which would be displaced as a result of the
project. The benefit of reduced fuel cost is expressed in the economic cost
of fuel.
