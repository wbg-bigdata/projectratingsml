THIRD HIGHWAY PROJECT
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower:     United Republic of Cameroon
Amount:       US$16.5 million IBRD Loan
Terms:        20 years, including 5 years of grace at annual interest rate of
7.45 percent.
Project
Description:  The proposed project is designed to reduce transport costs on
the south-north Transcameroonian rail/road route and to improve
overall transport planning and coordination. It consists of:
(a) reconstruction of the Garoua-Figuil road (95 km) to two-
lane paved standards; and (b) technical assistance and fellow-
ships to strengthen the planning and coordination capacity of
the Ministry of Transport.
The proposed project would improve land transport facilities for
the external trade of Northern Cameroon and Chad, and form an
important part of the overall development effort for Northern
Cameroon by serving agricultural, industrial and administrative
centers. It would also assist in better allocating scarce
resources in the transport sector. The risk that the main
project benefits would not materialize due to cost increases is
minimal, since the reconstruction contract has already been
awarded and work is starting.
Estimated
Cost:         Project c'osts, net of US$3.7 million equivalent in taxes, is
estimated at US$21.6 million, of which about US$16.5 million
(76 percent) is foreign exchange. Contingencies total US$3.5
million, with physical contingencies nine percent and price
contingencies ten percent of base cost:

INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE
UNITED REPUBLIC OF CAMEROON FOR A
THIRD HIGHWAY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan for the equivalent of US$16.5 million to the United Republic of Cameroon
to help finance the proposed Third Highway Project. The Bank loan would have
a term of twenty years, including five years of grace, with interest at 7.45
percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report, "Proposals for a Medium-Term Public Development Program,
A Special Study, Cameroon" (No. 1097a-CM), was distributed to the Executive
Directors on May 11, 1976. The findings of an economic mission which visited
Cameroon in October-November 1976 are incorporated below. The mission's
report is being reviewed by the Government. Annex I provides basic country
data.
Economic Potential
3.        Cameroon hag a population of about 7.6 million (1976) and covers
an area of 475,000 km . The country's natural resources are considerable
and varied, but not always easily accessible. Soils and climatic conditions
permit cultivation of a wide range of crops, and the forest areas of the
Southeast contain large untapped timber resources. The North holds promis-
ing potential for livestock development. The main opportunities for develop-
ment in Cameroon lie in the expansion of agricultural production, including
forestry, and the processing of agricultural and forestry products for ex-
port. Offshore oil and gas exploration has yielded modest results. Trade
transportation and transit services are other important economic activities.
Cameroon's main economic centers are separated by vast underpopulated areas;
furthermore the country's transport facilities also serve landlocked Chad.
As a result, a large port and inland transport infrastructure are essential
for promoting agriculture, forestry and industry, and strengthening Cameroon's
role as a regional trade center.



-2-
Past Performance
4.        During the Second Plan period (1966-1971), GDP increased at a high
rate of 7.6 percent per annum. However, during the Third Plan period (1971-
1976), output grew at only 2.5 percent per annum partly because of the drought
which affected the North of Cameroon in 1972 and 1973 and the impact of world-
wide recession and unfavorable terms of trade, partly because of serious dif-
ficulties in maintaining and expanding Cameroon's main tree crops which have
been compounded by the failure of producer prices to keep up with those of
competing food cash crops and inputs, and partly because of the limited size,
early saturation, and slow expansion of the domestic market for import sub-
stituting manufactures. Terms of trade improved during 1966-1971 but dete-
riorated during 1971-1976. As a result, gross domestic income increased
faster than GDP at 8.3 percent per annum during 1966-1971, but grew only by
2.4 percent per annum during 1971-1976. Population growth is estimated at
about 1.8 percent per annum in the 1960's, about 1.9 percent until the mid-
1970's and about 2.3 percent from 1975-1980. Per capita GNP reached about
US$300 in 1976.
5.        During the 1960's, a confluence of a number of favorable factors
led to the high growth of output and income. Agriculture, accounting for
about one-third of GDP, increased at a rate of 5.5 percent per annum during
1966-1971. Most agricultural crops (except cotton, rubber, millet/sorghum),
livestock, fishing and forestry experienced high growth rates, thanks to
favorable supply and demand conditions such as high domestic income growth,
favorable producer prices, and rapid economic expansion abroad. For example,
during the 1960's although Cameroon already faced the problem of the increas-
ing age of its cocoa and coffee trees, supply was still able to increase
reflecting the high amount of new plantings during the 1950's and early
1960's. In addition, the Government was able to maintain adequate cocoa
producer prices even when export prices dropped thanks to the reserves built
up earlier in the cocoa stabilization fund. Manufacturing and mining, account-
ing for 11 percent of GDP, increased at 10 percent per annum during 1966-1971
due mainly to the rapid development of import substitution industries, partic-
ularly manufactured consumer goods, facilitated by the high rate of domestic
income growth and the availability of foreign exchange for the purchase of
inputs and intermediate goods. The high rate of expansion of productive
activities was accompanied by the rapid growth of construction activities,
public administration and other services.
6.        In contrast, during the Third Plan period, a number of external
and internal factors led to a much reduced growth in output and income.
Agricultural growth declined to only 3.6 percent per annum, influenced par-
ticularly by commercial crops (1.3 percent per annum, or less than one-tenth
of the preceding rate). On the other hand, production of the main subsis-
tence food crops expanded at about 6 percent per annum reflecting increasing
demand and high prices for such crops in urban areas. Growth of commercial
forestry production declined sharply due to reduced Western European demand,
lower domestic construction activities, and some transportation bottlenecks,
while the drought cut growth in livestock production (mainly cattle in



- 3 -
the north) from 7.2 percent to 3.3 percent per annum. Cocoa and Arabica cof-
fee, accounting for about 55 percent of commercial crops, actually decreased,
mainly because of the failure of cocoa producer prices to keep up with those
of competing food cash crops, the termination of the fertilizer subsidy pro-
gram for Arabica coffee with the end of the supporting foreign assistance,
the increasing age of cocoa and coffee trees, unfavorable climatic condi-
tions in some years, and inadequate Government services to counter the black
pod disease of the cocoa trees. For the other main commercial crops, the
declining trend in cotton experienced in the earlier Plan period was reversed
in large part through the efforts of SODECOTON, a specialized public enter-
prise; reversal from decline to growth in rubber and an acceleration in growth
of oil palm were facilitated by two plantation projects assisted by the World
Bank Group and other co-donors. Growth in manufacturing slowed, following the
first wave of import substitution, and with rising costs and expanded claims
on available public revenues, real growth in public administration was also
reduced below the 1966-1971 rate. Construction actually declined during 1971-
1976 and with a deceleration in exports, near stagnation in imports and the
low growth in real income throughout the economy, other services (mainly trade
and transport) increased only at one percent per annum.
Investment and Savings
7.        During the Second Plan period, the investment rate, including
increases in stocks, exceeded 16 percent of GDP, and gross domestic savings
and gross national savings were respectively 13.4 and 12.6 percent of GDP.
Foreign resources financed about 33 percent of investment during this period.
During the Third Plan period, despite slow income growth, the investment rate
increased to 18.1 percent of GDP, as the share of public investment increased
to almost 70 percent of total fixed investment. Gross domestic savings and
gross national savings rose to 16.4 and 13.9 percent of GDP, but debt service
increased by 60 percent. External resources therefore continued to finance
about one-third of total investment during this period. This substantial
improvement in savings during 1971-1976 was due to a drastic reduction in the
real growth of consumption, particularly private consumption, to less than 2
percent per annum from 9 percent per annum during 1966-1971. One of the
prices paid for the substantial improvement in savings was, however, a limita-
tion on farmer's earnings in tree crops, which provided inadequate incentives
to induce farmers to obtain more output from the existing stock and to do
sufficient treatment and new plantings to maintain and expand production
capacity. The maintenance of a high investment rate during a period of low
output growth resulted in an apparent reduction in efficiency of investment.
Some reduction in capital productivity was also attributable to investments,
such as oil exploration, which would lead to production only a number of years
later, investment in transport infrastructure (about 20 percent of total
investment) which would result in increased output through the years, and
social infrastructure investments which would likely increase welfare more
rapidly than output. During this period there was considerable progress in
the development of high level human skills. For example, the number of
physicians increased by more than 50 percent (decreasing the population per
physician rate to about 20,000), dentists more than doubled and pharmacists
increased by more than 5 times.



-4-
Public Finance and Balance of Payments
8.        Budgetary revenue was respectively 16.6 and 17.2 percent of GDP
during 1966-1971 and 1971-1976, while gross public savings after debt ser-
vice in total public investment declined from about 39 percent in 1966-1971
to about 36 percent in 1971-1976. The balance of payments was not a major
constraint until recent years. However, imports increased rapidly in 1975
and 1976 as a result of worldwide inflation and heavy public development
expenditure, especially in capital goods. At the same time, agricultural
exports declined, particularly exports of cocoa and timber, causing sizeable
current account deficits. The bulk of the current account deficits was fi-
nanced by net capital inflows but a substantial drawdown of international
reserves was also made in 1975. Therefore, net official international re-
serves decreased from more than 2 months in 1974 to less than one month of
imports in 1975. In 1977, exports recovered substantially (by 35 percent)
but imports also increased (by 28.5 percent) because of economic recovery
and expanded investment. Gross official international reserves were rebuilt
in 1976 and 1977, in part by the use of IMF credit (Oil Facilities and Com-
pensatory Financing), but net official international reserves continued to
be less than one month of imports in 1977. This was a low level by inter-
national standards but still acceptable considering Cameroon's membership
in the Central African Monetary Union.
Development Issues and Prospects
9.        Cameroon's main medium and long term potential lies in the devel-
opment through both industrial plantations and smallholders of a diversified
agricultural sector, comprising export crops and domestic food crops to feed
the growing urban population and replace imports, particularly of grains.
Implementation of such a strategy depends on an appropriate mix of public
intervention and support and price and policy measures to stimulate private
initiative; net financial returns to the public sector are more difficult
to capture than in a less diversified foreign trade-oriented strategy.
Factors which complicate the agricultural development effort further in
Cameroon are the extensive dispersion of its main economic and population
centers separated by vast underpopulated areas, its regional and institu-
tional diversity, the competition between export and cash food crops, for
the dwindling agricultural labor in some parts of the country, the dependence
of a substantial part of public revenue and savings on cocoa and coffee, and
the limited availability of skilled agricultural agents and administrators.
Through its technical assistance and education projects and through its
normal project work, the World Bank Group is supporting Cameroon's effort
in manpower training and development in public services in agriculture, as
well as other sectors. In industry the Government has moved to channel more
financial resources for investment directly through the public sector, in
addition to the indirect support provided by tax incentive and other meas-
ures, which have been in existence for many years. The Government has
actively participated in a World Bank Group study of the manufacturing
sector whose results will help to identify bottlenecks and opportunities
to develop existing as well as new industrial activities.



- 5 -
10.       In the medium term, GDP growth will accelerate substantially because
of recovery of cocoa, Robusta coffee and logs spurred by high international
commodity prices, further expansion in most other commercial and food crops,
increase in manufacturing and mining production. and rapid growth in construc-
tion activities and services resulting from expanded investment activities
and rapid income growth. The outlook for considerable agricultural growth
during 1976-1981 is based on the maintenance of cocoa output at near the
previous peak level for a number of years, recovery for Robusta coffee, con-
tinuing expansion for Arabica coffee, cotton, rubber, oil palm and most other
commercial and food crops and livestock production, and continuing recovery
then further expansion of commercial forestry production. This projection
is also based on the assessment of the medium-term outlook for Cameroon's
exports, projects under implementation, and certain policy alternatives.
Continuing growth of manufacturing production from existing and expanded
facilities, particularly in food, beverages and construction materials, and
new mining and manufacturing output of crude oil, sugar, paper pulp and other
products, are projected to result in a marked improvement in manufacturing
and mining growth during 1976-1981. With high growth in productive and in-
vestment activities, construction and services are also expected to increase
at a high rate.
11.       Long-term growth in the 1980's is projected to be somewhat con-
strained because the expected high investment rate during 1976-1981 is not
likely to be sustainable due to worsening terms of trade, at least through
the 1980's, and the necessity of prudent debt management to maintain the
country's long-term capacity to borrow. Growth prospects will be impor-
tantly influenced by the extent to which Cameroon succeeds in the diffi-
cult task of maintaining and expanding the country's main traditional ex-
port crops, cocoa and coffee, and the large-scale development of still
unexploited forestry resources. Results of studies on the forestry poten-
tial, forestry sector development policy, investment plans and transport
requirements, many of which are parts of World Bank Group projects, will
support the latter development. In addition, there are still uncertain in-
dications for the exploitation of iron ore, but with heavy investment re-
quirements, and long lead times to establish commercially viable export
operations, production could probably not begin until the end of the 1980's.
Fourth Development Plan (1976-1981)
12.       Cameroon is implementing its Fourth Economic and Social Develop-
ment Plan. Private investment is included in the Plan, and is encouraged,
under Government guidelines, to expand production capacity in agriculture,
forestry, mining and manufacturing. A part of financing of private invest-
ment activities, however, will be publicly guaranteed borrowing. The Plan
investment program of some US$3.1 billion (in 1974/75 prices) is about 80
percent higher in real terms than the estimated level achieved during the
last Plan period and almost triples previous Plan expenditure in nominal
terms. The Plan gives greater emphasis to agricultural development (about
16 percent of total investment), power (11 percent, mainly the Song Loulou



hydroelectric scheme), manufacturing and mining (22 percent with a substan-
tial part in oil exploitation, refining and storage), transport infrastruc-
ture (26 percent), urban development and low-cost housing (7 percent) and
social infrastructure (7 percent). Public investment is expected to account
for 73 percent of total investment. However, because of the high dependence
of public revenues and savings on cocoa and coffee prices, which are projected
to decline substantially from their record levels in the last three years
(1979-81) of the Fourth Plan while import prices are expected to continue
their inexorable rise, and of the need for adequate producer prices to pro-
vide sufficient incentives for production and new plantings to farmers, and
because of the need to keep supplementary borrowing at commercial terms at
prudent levels to maintain Cameroon's long-term capacity to borrow, public
investment should be reduced by 10-20 percent from the planned level. The
investment rate during the Fourth Plan period would then be about 22 percent
of GDP, and total investment in current prices would be US$3.4-3.7 billion
or about US$690-740 million per year.
Financial Prospects and Creditworthiness
13.       In the first two years of the Fourth Plan period (July 1976-June
1978), thanks to favorable terms of trade, public savings after debt service
would finance about 65 percent of total public investment. However, in the
last three years (July 1978-June 1981), public savings after debt service are
projected to finance only about 30 percent of total public investment and
this share of domestic public financing is likely to continue in the longer
run. Cameroon will thus have to rely increasingly on external financing for
the bulk of its public investment, and foreign official lenders should con-
tinue to finance a high proportion of total project costs of externally fi-
nanced projects, including local costs in appropriate cases. An increasing
reliance on foreign borrowing during a period of deteriorating terms of trade
will require careful external debt management. Cameroon continues to be
creditworthy for World Bank financing on the basis of its ability to maintain
and improve productivity in the utilization of the country's resources in the
medium-term and its potential in the long-term to further diversify the econ-
omy by developing still unexploited resources. On the reasonable assumption
that at least 50 percent of foreign public capital will be on concessionary
terms, the foreign debt service ratio, 5.9 percent of export earnings in 1976,
could be maintained below 13 percent by 1983.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN CAMEROON
14.       The Bank Group's commitments in Cameroon now amount to US$309.6
million and cover twenty-four projects: ten in agriculture, eight in
transportation, three in education, one in public utilities, one small-
and medium-scale enterprise project, and one technical assistance project.
Transportation represents the largest share (44 percent) of our past commit-
ments followed by agriculture (38 percent). Annex II contains a summary
statement of Bank loans, IDA credits and IFC investments as of November 30,
1977 and includes notes on ongoing projects. Although delays and setbacks



- 7 -
have been occasionally encountered in the execution of projects, the Govern-
ment has consistently shown willingness to collaborate with the Bank in find-
ing solutions to such problems.
15.       For the future, the Bank Group's strategy is to support the Gov-
ernment in its effort to increase agricultural production, including export-
oriented crops, and in the process create productive employment in rural
areas; to upgrade and improve the operation and maintenance of the country's
infrastructure; to stimulate investment by local entrepreneurs and increase
employment in urban areas; and to increase the efficiency of Cameroon's
institutions.
16.       Bank Group assistance to Cameroon supports the priority the Gov-
ernment rightly attaches to the regional distribution of agricultural devel-
opment and to a sound balance between improving conditions in the traditional
sector and promoting plantation agriculture, including smallholder schemes.
Thus we have helped the Government create an effective and well-managed plan-
tation sector by financing oil palm and rubber plantations in the south and
west. At the same time, we have helped promote smallholder rice irrigation
in the north. The ongoing cocoa project is helping to modernize cocoa grow-
ing by smallholders and to raise rural productivity in areas south and west
of the capital. The rubber project approved in June 1975 is helping develop
the southwest coastal region. Rural development projects in populated but
poor regions are being established with the assistance of the Bank. The
Plaine des M'Bo Rural Development Project, which was approved by the Board in
February 1977, is helping to finance studies and three-year trial activities
required before a full-scale rural development program can be launched. The
Rural Development Fund Project is designed to help the Government establish
the machinery for processing and implementing small-scale rural development
schemes. The Second SOCAPALM Project approved in March 1977 and the Second
CAMDEV Project, approved in December 1977, are follow-ups to successful oil
palm projects (SOCAPALM I and CAMDEV I) and are a first step in promoting
smallholder oil palm plantations in Cameroon. A rice project in the north,
which is a follow-up to the successful SEMRY I project, was very recently
presented to the Board. Field appraisals for the Western Highlands and ZAPI
Rural Development Projects have been completed and these projects are sched-
uled to be presented to the Board during FY78. Besides promoting much needed
foodstuffs' production, increased Bank Group lending for agriculture will
support the Government's effort to focus on rural development in order to
improve income distribution and to achieve a better balance in regional de-
velopment.
17.       Recognizing the crucial importance of transportation to economic
growth in Cameroon and in neighboring countries, the Government has devoted
the largest portion of public investment to this sector. The Bank Group,
together with bilateral institutions, has substantially aided development
of adequate transport facilities. The First and Second Highway Projects
were designed to help complete the country's basic trunk road system. The
latter project encountered severe cost overruns which were partly alleviated
by a Supplementary Credit approved in March 1976, as well as by the elimina-
tion of the reconstruction of the Garoua-Figuil section from the project.



- 8 -
The Second Railway Project of 1974 has focused on track improvement and
expansion of the equipment needed to maintain and augment the railway's over-
all carrying capacity. Given projected sharp traffic increases, and the
backlog of required investments, substantial capital outlays are still nec-
essary, particularly for the expansion of the port of Douala, which is being
assisted by a Bank loan and IDA credit and for some related facilities such
as a railway station and marshalling yard to be built outside the port area.
An engineering loan, approved in May 1976, will help complete the engineer-
ing of this station and marshalling yard. A study of the improvements re-
quired in the Douala-Yaounde transport corridor, which was financed under a
Bank project and designed to help determine an economically optimal invest-
ment strategy for this corridor, has led to a proposed investment package that
is being discussed between the Government and a number of aid-giving agencies,
including the Bank. Future road investments should place greater emphasis on
road maintenance and on developing the network of feeder and farm access roads.
Our future operations in the road sector have been planned accordingly. The
Feeder Roads Project approved on November 15, 1977 will establish institutions
for feeder roads maintenance, in addition to providing the necessary resources
for a feeder road program to support high priority agricultural/rural develop-
ment projects. The proposed Fourth Highway project which is currently under
preparation will concentrate on road maintenance and rehabilitation. In other
sectors, the Small-and Medium-Scale Enterprise Project, approved in 1975,
focuses mainly on developing local entrepreneurship. A Third Education Proj-
ect, approved in April 1976, places special emphasis on rural education and
training.
18.       In all our projects we include, as needed, training, technical
assistance, and other provisions necessary for strengthening institutions
and improving sector policies. The Technical Assistance Project, approved
in June 1977, will help strengthen Government services in several key min-
istries involved in investment planning, policy analysis and project pro-
cessing. In addition, through our economic work we will continue to advise
the authorities, at their request, on development questions in general, and
on specific matters such as economic management, problems of industrial
development, and manpower development. To help achieve the Government s
priorities and to support our future lending, the Bank's strategy will re-
quire continuing emphasis on strengthening the institutional framework, par-
ticularly concerning sector planning and project preparation and implementa-
tion in transportation and rural and urban development.
19.       During the second half of the sixties, overall disbursements of
external aid to Cameroon amounted to about US$40-45 million a year. While
at the beginning of this period 65 percent of aid funds were grants, the
proportion of loans slowly increased. A major part of external assistance
was provided by France and was concentrated in infrastructure and productive
sectors. The European Development Fund and European Investment Bank directed
their lending mainly to agriculture, with infrastructure in second place.
Bank and IDA disbursements were small during this period. From 1972 to 1976
overall disbursements of foreign aid increased to about US$90 million with
one-fifth as grants. The Bank and IDA share of these inflows amounted to



- 9 -
about 23 percent. Our lending to Cameroon has been closely coordinated with
other donors; in twelve of our twenty-four projects, joint or parallel co-
financing arrangements have been made.
20.       Public debt outstanding and disbursed as of December 31, 1976
amounted to US$529.3 million and is projected to reach US$2.1 billion in 1983.
Public debt service as a proportion of export earnings amounted to 5.9 percent
in 1976 and is projected to reach 12.4 percent in 1983. At that time annual
foreign aid disbursements may be over US$400 million with only 7 percent con-
sisting of grants. At end-1976 IBRD debt accounted for 10.9 percent of Cam-
eroon's public debt outstanding and disbursed, and 11.4 percent of its public
debt service. IDA credits accounted for 12.8 percent of public debt outstand-
ing and 1.1 percent of public debt service.   The Bank and IDA are expected
to account for about 22 percent of total public debt and 13 percent of public
debt service in 1983.
21.       In October 1974, Cameroon became IFC's 100th member.    IFC's first
operation in Cameroon, a US$450,000 underwriting to bring domestic share-
holders into a previously wholly foreign-owned shoe manufacturing company,
was approved in May 1975. In September 1976, the IFC Board approved an
equity investment of nearly US$900,000 in a foreign-owned rubber estate
(SAFACAM). The investment will assist in the rehabilitation and diversi-
fication of an existing estate, producing rubber for export and palm oil for
the domestic market. The operation will also facilitate participation by
domestic shareholders. On November 29, 1977 the Board approved a third opera-
tion consisting of an investment of up to US$125,000 in the share capital of
a promotional company for maize development.
PART III - THE SECTOR
Infrastructure
22.       Cameroon's transport system consists of about 58,000 km of roads,
1,170 km of railway, one main port, two auxilliary ports and a river port.
Air transport is served by one international airport and 13 domestic air-
ports. The main transport system which is export-import oriented is focused
on Douala, the commercial center, which has both a deep-water port and an
international airport. Links to the rest of the country are provided along
two principal corridors - the Transcameroon rail/road route and the north-
south Douala-Bafoussam-Foumban axis. Emphasis on transport development to
date has been on modernizing the main system. However, rehabilitation of
secondary roads and feeder roads are now planned or in the early stages of
implementation. The port of Douala is currently being expanded with Bank
assistance.
The Road Network
23.       The road network in Cameroon totals about 58,000 km of which about
2,000 km are paved. The primary and secondary road networks total about



- 10 -
17,000 km, the remaining 41,000 km being rural and feeder roads. Although
the road system is extensive, many trunk roads were built more than twenty
years ago and standards are inadequate to accommodate current traffic, e.g.
the Yaounde-Douala road and the Yaounde-Bafoussam road. Many roads are
impassable during part of the rainy season. As a result, trucking costs are
high. Some of the most important roads, which are part of the Transcameroon
route and the Douala-Bafoussam-Foumban axis, have recently been or are being
reconstructed to paved standards. The rest of the primary and secondary
roads, although generally adequate in extent and distribution for the country's
economic needs, are mostly in poor condition due to inadequate maintenance.
To correct this shortcoming, a five-year road maintenance program is being
prepared by the Government for which Bank financing will be sought. The
recently approved Feeder Roads Project is designed to improve and maintain
the feeder roads network in three Bank agricultural/rural development projects
and to build the institutional framework for the development and maintenance
of the feeder road network.
Transport Investments
24.       The transport investment plan contained in the five-year economic
plan is a consolidation of the programs prepared by each ministry responsible
for a specific transport mode. Transport investment under the Third Plan
amounted to CFAF 99 billion (US$404 million) expressed in constant 1975/76
francs, or about 20 percent of total public investment. Foreign credits
covered 60 percent of the cost of transport projects. The target set for
transport investment in the Fourth Plan is CFAF 137 billion (US$559 million),
about 20 percent of the overall Plan investment. However, because of the
dependency on foreign financing and given considerable cost escalation, the
number of transport projects which may be realized by 1981 is likely to be
reduced. Establishing transport priorities and strengthening the planning
effort is therefore an immediate necessity. The Department of Highways has
separate budgets for road construction and for road maintenance. In 1977-78
the investment budget for road construction amounted to CFAF 15.2 billion
(US$62.0 million) and the road maintenance budget amounted to CFAF 2.8 billion
(US$11.4 million). The maintenance budget will be increased under the pro-
posed five-year maintenance program.
Transport Sector Management
25.       The Ministry of Economic Affairs and Planning, the Ministry of
Equipment and Housing, and the Ministry of Transport, which are all concerned
in varying degrees with planning and processing of transport projects, lack
adequate staff to deal with Cameroon's pressing transport needs. The Ministry
of Transport, created in 1970, has overall responsibility for sector policy,
planning and coordination, and for screening transport projects prepared by
other Ministries. From the beginning, the Ministry has been handicapped by
a shortage of qualified personnel, and its planning activities have remained
limited. Attempts to reinforce the organization and machinery for transport
planning and policy-making and for project preparation and execution, had only
limited success in the past. The Bank has had a continuing dialogue with the



- 11 -
Government on the need for strengthening transport sector management. Partly
as a result of this a Planning and Coordination Unit has been created within
the Ministry of Transport and technical assistance experts are being recruited
under the Technical Assistance Project to strengthen the capabilities of the
Ministries of Economic Affairs and Planning and of Transport. Further measures
required for reinforcing transport planning and coordination and ensuring the
integration of transport and other sectoral planning are being discussed
between the Government and the Bank.
26.       The Department of Highways within the Ministry of Equipment and
Housing is in charge of road planning, construction and maintenance, but has
no specific planning unit. However, one transport economist was provided
under the Second Highway Project, and preliminary discussions have been held
with the Government concerning the creation of a road planning unit. The
Second Highway Project also provides the services of two expatriate engi-
neers to the Department of Highways.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Introduction
27.       The project is based on data collected and analyzed by Cameroon
Government staff with the assistance of consultants. A Bank mission appraised
the project in October/November 1977. Negotiations were held on January 10,
1978 in Yaounde.
Background
28.       Preinvestment studies for the Garoua-Figuil road were included in
the First Highway Project (Loan 663/Credit 180-CM of March 1970) as part of
the Garoua-Figuil-Mora road. The studies were satisfactorily completed in
October 1973. Reconstruction of the Garoua-Figuil-Mora road was included in
the Second Highway Project (Loan 935/Credit 429-CM of September 1973), as
well as reconstruction of two other roads and consultants' services (see
Report No. 180-CM, Appraisal of a Second Highway Project, Cameroon, June 11,
1973). As a result of the extraordinary rise in world prices for road con-
struction, which started at the end of 1973, the total cost of the Second
Highway Project doubled. To help cover this cost overrun, the Bank Group
made a Supplementary Credit in 1976 of US$15.0 million. The Government
tripled the amount of its participation and agreed to postpone reconstruc-
tion of the Garoua-Figuil road, which was deleted from the project.
29.       The Second Highway Project also includes an overall road maintenance
study to prepare a five-year maintenance program which was expected to be one
of the main components of the present project. Execution of this study by the
consultants has been very slow. The consultants issued a revised First Phase
Report in September 1977, and the five-year maintenance program was pre-
appraised in October 1977. However, there are still several gaps in the
preparation of this program, which will be filled under the Second Phase



- 12 -
of the study, started in November 1977. Since the Government is eager to pro-
ceed with reconstruction of the Garoua-Figuil road under the advantageous
terms now available (see para. 36 below), and completing preparation of the
maintenance program would unduly delay the project, the maintenance program
was transferred to the proposed Fourth Highway Project, scheduled for FY79,
which would focus on: (a) maintenance of the primary and secondary road
networks; (b) rehabilitation of major gravel roads; (c) control of vehicle
loads; (d) promotion of the domestic contracting industry; and (e) improvement
of road transport planning.
30.       The necessity of improving overall transport planning and co-
ordination was identified during preparation of the First Highway Project.
Strengthening transport sector institutions has proved slow. The main con-
clusion of the Project Performance Audit Report for the First Highway Project
(No. 1574, April 19, 1977) is that further effort in transport coordination
and strengthening is required.
Project Objectives
31.       The objectives of this project are to reduce transport costs on
the south-north Transcameroon rail/road route by reconstructing its last
unimproved road section, and to improve transport planning and coordination
by strengthening the planning capacity of the Ministry of Transport.
Project Description
32.       The project consists of:
(a)  reconstruction of the Garoua-Figuil road (95 km) to two-
lane paved standards; and
(b) technical assistance and fellowships to strengthen the
transport planning and coordination unit (PCU) within
the Ministry of Transport.
33.       The Garoua-Figuil road (95 km) is the only unimproved road section
of the Transcameroon route. The road runs from south to north across a gen-
erally flat region.   The existing road was paved in the late fifties to two-
lane standards.   The contractor, however, went bankrupt before completing
pavement of about 20 km which remained gravelled. The road is deteriorating
rapidly, in spite of regular routine maintenance. On a gradually increasing
number of sections, where pavement failure is too advanced to allow mainte-
nance, the Department of Highways is temporarily returning the road surface
to gravel.
34.       Reconstruction would comprise complete rehabilitation of the drain-
age system, reconstruction of four bridges, improvement of the vertical and/or
horizontal alignment on limited sections, widening of the roadway where nec-
essary and overall strengthening and reconstruction of the existing pavement.
Three long and narrow one-lane bridges, which need only minor repairs, would
be kept. Consultants would assist the Government in supervising the recon-
struction.



- 13 -
35.       The Technical Assistance Project (Credit 673-CM of June 1977) pro-
vides for a transport economist to reinforce the PCU for three years. This
expert will play a major role in stimulating PCU's work and coordinating it
with that of other Government agencies. Furthermore, the terms of reference
of the PCU were agreed during negotiations. The proposed Third Highway proj-
ect would provide for a second economist/statistician for three years to
assist in improving basic data collection and analysis. The proposed proj-
ect would also provide for two one-year fellowships to give complementary
training abroad to PCU professionals existing or to be hired, and two three-
month fellowships to their supervisors, the Director of Transport and his
deputy.
Procurement
36.       In November 1974, after international competitive bidding, under
the Second Highway Project, the lowest evaluated bidder, contractor Wayss
und Freytag (Germany), was awarded the contract to reconstruct the Figuil-
Mora road and was also awarded the contract for the Garoua-Figuil road, but,
because of the project cost overruns, the Government never gave the order to
proceed with the works. In October 1977, the contractor offered to reactivate
his old contract with a five percent reduction on the original bid price --
plus price escalation -- provided work could start immediately. The contrac-
tor satisfactorily completed reconstruction of the Figuil-Mora road in July
1977 and expected to benefit from the continuity of working on the Garoua-
Figuil section during the 1977-78 dry season. The contractor's original bid
was about 50 percent below that of the second lowest bidder in 1974. It is
most likely that a new call for bids would result in substantially higher
prices. In addition to the five percent discount offered by the contractor,
the Government and the appraisal mission estimated that if work started im-
mediately, instead of during the 1978-79 dry season after a new call for bids,
another ten percent of project costs would be saved due to lower price esca-
lation. To take advantage of this low price, the Government accepted the
contractor's proposal. The Bank finds these arrangements satisfactory.
37.       The Government has awarded the contract for reconstruction supervi-
sion to joint venture Lamarre Valois/Ingeroute (Canada/France) who carried out
the preinvestment studies and satisfactorily supervised reconstruction of
the Figuil-Mora road. The consultant who would provide technical assistance
to the Ministry of Transport would be employed under terms of reference and
conditions satisfactory to the Bank (Section 3.03 (b) of the draft Loan Agree-
ment).
Execution
38.       The Ministry of Economic Affairs and Planning would have overall
responsibility for project execution. However, detailed execution would be
through the Ministry of Equipment and Housing (through its Department of High-
ways) for road reconstruction, and through the Ministry of Transport for
strengthening of transport planning.



- 14 -
39.       The reconstruction works would start in January 1978, and last until
July 1979. Technical assistance to the Ministry of Transport would start at
end-1978 and last three years. Fellowships would be awarded for the 1978-79
academic year. The project would be completed in four years (January 1978 to
end-1981).
Project Cost and Financing
40.       Project costs, net of taxes and duties, are estimated at US$21.6
million, with a foreign exchange cost of US$16.5 million (76 percent). The
reconstruction cost of the Garoua-Figuil road is based on the lowest evaluated
bid received in April 1974, including the contractor's rebate of five percent.
A contingency allowance of ten percent has been added to allow for increases
in quantities. The reconstruction cost per km (including contingencies, but
excluding supervision costs) amounts to US$188,000 net of taxes and super-
vision in January 1978 prices. The cost of reconstruction supervision amounts
to about eight percent of that of the reconstruction works. Price contingen-
cies, amounting to nine percent, have been calculated for the road reconstruc-
tion by applying the estimated variation of local and foreign parameters to
the price escalation formula of the contractor's contract. Other price contin-
gencies are estimated in accordance with expected international price trends.
The proposed loan of US$16.5 million would finance the project's entire for-
eign cost. The Government would provide all local costs (US$8.8 million,
including US$3.7 million of taxes and duties).
41.       Retroactive financing not exceeding US$300,000 is recommended for
the foreign cost payment of the consultants' advance for supervision of the
Garoua-Figuil road reconstruction. Reconstruction works would start in
January 1978, but the contractor has agreed to prefinance the works and
accept deferment of payments until the Bank loan becomes effective. For
these payments, which are limited to the contractor's advance and correspond
to a foreign cost of about US$2.0 million (12 percent of total Bank financ-
ing), the rebate would be reduced by the contractor from 5 to 2 percent.
Disbursements
42.       The loan would be disbursed to cover:
(a) 65 percent of total cost of civil works, including taxes,
(representing the estimated foreign exchange component):
US$12.5 million;
(b) 100 percent of foreign exchange costs of engineering
consultants' services: US$1.1 million; and
(c)  100 percent of foreign exchange costs of technical
assistance and fellowships: US$0.3 million.
US$2.6 million would be unallocated. Disbursements would be fully documented.
An estimated schedule of disbursement is in Annex IV.

Project Benefits and Justification
43.       The project road is the center link in a trunk road serving local
and inter-regional trade of the 2.2 million people of northern Cameroon. A
number of agricultural projects for northern Cameroon are being carried out
by the Bank and the other foreign donors. The current project would form an
important part of the overall regional development effort, serving directly
the economic and administrative center of Garoua, the agricultural marketing
town of Pitoa, and the expanding cement industry of Figuil. Cotton is the
main crop being transported on the project road. Ongoing agricultural and
settlement schemes will, however, stimulate transport demand for other
agricultural products. As a link in the Transcameroon route, the project
road carries the major portion of Chadian imports and exports. In 1976-77,
67 percent of Chadian imports (excluding petroleum) went through Douala. Of
the Chadian cotton exports, 59 percent or 38,000 tons went through Cameroon,
part of which was trans-shipped to river barges at Garoua. Despite the poor
condition of the existing road, average daily traffic in 1977 was about 480
vehicles. Traffic on the Garoua-Pitoa section (17 km) was estimated at about
900 vehicles per day, while traffic on the Pitoa-Figuil section (78 km) was
about 385 vehicles. Trucks constituted 31 percent of traffic composition on
the Garoua-Pitoa section and 43 percent of traffic on the Pitoa-Figuil sec-
tion. During the 1972-77 period, heavy truck-trailers and tractor-trailers
increased significantly their share of freight transport.
44.       Quantified benefits consist of savings in vehicle operating costs
and savings in road maintenance costs. Savings in transit time for passen-
gers have not been quantified. Another non-quantified benefit is the elimi-
nation of waiting time for truck traffic due to temporary road closings.
Routine maintenance cost is estimated at CFAF 208,000 per km. The cost of
resurfacing every fourth year is estimated at CFAF 2.2 million per km.
45.       The economic rate of return is estimated at 20 percent based on
a 20-year economic life. The first year return is estimated at 16 percent
for the Garoua-Pitoa section and 15 percent for the Pitoa-Figuil section.
The rate of return is based on an overall traffic growth rate of 8 percent,
with a 2 percent higher than average increase in heavy truck traffic for the
first ten years. This projection takes into account the accelerated economic
development in the northern part of Cameroon as well as recent traffic trends.
With a traffic growth rate lowered to 7 percent for the first 10 years and 5
percent for the following decade for all classes of traffic, the rate of re-
turn would be 18 percent. The latter growth rates were used during appraisal
of the project road in 1973, when the rate of return was found to be 17 per-
cent. Although construction costs have more than doubled, benefits have
increased through higher savings in vehicle operating costs and augmented
traffic in the first year after road construction.
46.       Bank experience with highway construction in Cameroon has demon-
strated that the two most serious problems are construction delays and cost
overruns. For the reconstruction of the Garoua-Figuil road, both of these
problems seem minimized, because the contractor is already in the field



- 16 -
and the contract has been awarded. However, if routine and periodic mainte-
nance costs included in the economic analysis should increase by 20 percent,
and at the same time benefits should decline by 20 percent, the economic rate
of the project would still be 15 percent. There are no special risks involved
in this project which is the center link of a trunk road with an established
average daily traffic of about 500 vehicles prior to reconstruction.
47.       Benefits from reconstructing this center link in the northern
axis road amplifies the benefits from the entire road investment under the
previous Bank projects. The savings to the economy of northern Cameroon
from reduction in transport cost will permeate the rural economy through
a growing volume of cash transactions. As an integral part of the develop-
ment effort for northern Cameroon, the project is thus expected to benefit
a population of more than two million people and, in addition, at least one
million people in neighboring parts of Chad.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
48.       The draft Loan Agreement between the United Republic of Cameroon
and the Bank and the Report of the Committee provided in Article III, Sec-
tion 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement are being distributed to the
Executive Directors separately.
49.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
50.       I recommend the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

Effectiveness Date: October 30, 1975; Closing
Date: March 31, 1978.
Implementation of this project was slow, especially in the initial
years, due to delays in both the construction and technical assistance pro-
grams. In 1975, a Supplementary Credit of US$1.2 million was approved to
cover cost increases due to currency realignments. Construction of all
buildings and delivery of all furniture and equipment have been completed, and
project accounts are now being finalized. The project was well managed,
particularly as project unit staff gained experience. A completion mission
which visited Cameroon in February 1977 found that project facilities are
generally well adapted to local requirements. However, because enrollments
greatly exceed capacity at some project secondary schools, specialized class-
rooms and laboratories are not always used as such, thereby reducing the
impact of the project on diversifying secondary education.
Cr. No. 320                  Second Education Project:  US$9.0 million Credit
of June 28, 1972; Effectiveness Date:
February 27, 1973; Closing Date: June 30, 1979.
Due to difficulties in selecting architects and agreeing on the
designs, project implementation is delayed by thirty months, construction
of the last school is expected to be completed by April 1978. To allow
full execution of the technical assistance component, an extension of the
closing date from June 30, 1979 to December 31, 1981, is expected. Selection

is now underway of members of the team to assist in launching the programs
of the adult vocational training center financed by the project, and all
specialists should be in post by the beginning of the coming school year.
The project is generally well managed. Following cost overruns due to
currency realignments and the accelerated price increases which have occurred
since 1973, the Government decided to finance the construction of one project
school with its own funds and another project school was transferred to the
Third Education Project (Loan 1245-T).
Cr. No. 429, Ln. No. 935     Second Highway Project:  US$24.0 million Credit

Effectiveness Date: December 20, 1973;
Closing Date: December 31, 1978.
Construction of the Pont du Noun-Foumban road (50 km) was completed
satisfactorily in December 1976 and of the Figuil-Mora road (163 km) in July
1977. Construction of the Douala-Pont du NKam road (161 km) is slow and its
completion is delayed by at least one year to July 1978. After a slow execu-
tion of the First Phase of the maintenance study, consultants started the
Second Phase in November 1977. The Government has hired technical assistance
for the Ministries of Equipment and Agriculture. The project has considerably
suffered from the 1973-1974 worldwide inflation, which nearly doubled its
total cost. Consequently, the Government agreed to postpone construction of
the Garoua-Figuil road (95 km). A Supplementary Credit of US$15.0 million was
approved in March 1976 to help alleviate the burden imposed on the Government
by the project's cost overruns.
Ln. No. 983                  Livestock Project:  US$11.6 million Loan of
May 14, 1974; Effectiveness Date: September 16,
1974; Closing Date: June 30, 1980.
Project implementation has progressed satisfactorily, although
some project components are behind schedule. Physical development and the
condition of livestock in two project ranches continues to be very good;
infrastructural works in the third are proceeding on schedule. Following
the bankruptcy of the first contractor, for the construction of two slaughter-
houses SODEPA has signed a new contract with the second lowest evaluated
bidder, TORVALE INTEC COPPAS, Ltd., U.K. Construction work started in August
1977 and is expected to be completed in 19 months. Sixty-six credits have
been disbursed, five more than the number anticipated at appraisal. The
first tsetse-fly eradication campaign ended in March 1977 with satisfactory
results; of the scheduled 160,000 ha, 51,000 ha were not treated because
the ongoing survey indicated there was not need to spray, 90,300 ha have
been freed, and the remainder carried over to the next campaign. Establish-
ment of a permanent 20 km anti-tsetse barrier was scheduled to start by
November 1977.

Ln. No. 1038                 Second Railway Project:   US$16.0 million Loan
to REGIFERCAM of September 18, 1974; Effective-
ness Date: December 18, 1974; Closing Date:
March 31, 1978.
Procurement of main project items has been satisfactory. The track
material was delivered and laid by December 1975, and delivery of rolling
stock was completed in 1976. Technical problems have been encountered with
the foundations of one of the piers of the Japoma bridge. Additional sup-
porting measures have been implemented and permanent monitoring of the
behavior of the bridge and its piers is being prepared. The works will be
completed in Spring 1978. Due to the fluctuation in exchange rates during
project implementation, additional financing was required to cover the cost of
the equipment already ordered and of the reconstruction of the Japoma bridge.
Consequently, the railway has obtained a supplier's credit of US$820,000 to
supplement Bank financing for the rolling stock, and the foreign exchange cost
of the consulting services (US$925,000) originally included in this Second
Railway Project has been transferred to the Third Railway Project financed
under Loan No. S-4. Due to the world slump in the timber market and substan-
tial increases in staff costs in 1974/75, REGIFERCAM experienced difficulty in
attaining the financial covenants included in the Loan Agreement. The Second
Railway Project financial targets were retained for the Third Railway Project
and the Government and REGIFERCAM are carrying out the necessary measures to
achieve the target set for 1978/79. Tariff increases averaging 34 percent
have been implemented since June 1976, and measures to increase productivity
and control operating costs are being taken. REGIFERCAM is thus expected to
achieve the agreed financial targets.
Ln. No. 1039                 Cocoa Project:  US$6.5 million Loan of September 18,
1974; Effectiveness Date: February 26, 1975;
Closing Date: June 30, 1981.
The recently instituted system of department-wide cooperatives does
not appear to be working well, although it is too early to form a definite
judgement. Incentives to farmers are now much better; apart from a higher
producer price (CFAF 220/kg compared to CFAF 150 last year) and free fungi-
cide, Government has announced plans to give grants and loans to young farmers
starting new cocoa plantations. SODECAO's management would also be improved
as soon as the choice is made between the two candidates who have been pro-
posed for the post of Director of Sector Operations.

Cr. No. 574                  Niete Rubber Estate Project:   US$16.0 million
Credit of June 3, 1975; Effectiveness Date:
December 1, 1975; Closing Date: June 30, 1981.
Progress in establishing Niete Rubber Estate has been steady;
planting is in fact slightly behind schedule; some 1,200 ha should be planted
by June 1978, compared with 1,500 assessed at appraisal, but construc.ion work
and land preparation are ahead of schedule. More labor has been available and
hired locally than anticipated and is sufficient up to now; recruitment from
other areas may become necessary soon. The 1977/78 budget, currently under
review, is to be revised to reduce development costs now estimated at 40 per-
cent above appraisal Estimates. The Terms of Reference for the regional mas-
ter plan studies have been drawn up.
Cr. No. 575                  Small- and Medium-Scale Enterprise Project;
US$3.0 million Credit of July 1, 1975;
Effectiveness Date: July 30, 1976 (Original
Effectiveness Date: December 1, 1976; First
Postponement: February 2, 1976; Second Post-
ponement: June 2. 1976): Closing Date:
December 31, 1980.
The Credit was declared effective on July 30, 1976. After consider-
able delay, two expatriate advisors for the Banque Camerounaise de Developpe-
ment (BCD) have assumed positions in BCD and commitment of the first sub-
projects has begun. The delivery of technical assistance to entrepreneurs
by the three agencies financed by UNDP under the Project is progressing and
interagency coordination has improved. The Government has requested that
the Bank Group and CCCE (the other co-financier) continue financing techni-
cal assistance once UNDP financing terminates.
Ln. No. 1245-T               Third Education Project:   US$17.0 million
Third Window Loan of July 2, 1976; Effective-
ness Date: December 31, 1976 (Original
Effectiveness Date: October 4, 1976); Closing
Date: December 31, 1981.
The effective date of the Credit was extended three months to allow
for signing of (a) the decree expanding the responsibilities of the Project
Unit, and (b) the contract between the Government and the consulting architects.
Progress on the construction program is now satisfactory: final designs have
been approved and construction has started at one school. Following the
Government's decision subsequent to project appraisal to change the location
of the two upper secondary agricultural schools, a new site in Dschang has
been selected. Members of the agricultural training team have arrived, and
the Government is ahead of schedule in implementing measures to strengthen
agricultural training in Cameroon. Project implementation is expected to
proceed on schedule.

Engineering Project: US$2.3 million Loan of
June 25, 1976; Effectiveness Date: October 5,
1976; Closing Date: September 30, 1979.
The first phase study (feasibility study) has been carried out by
Consultants. The final engineering study did start in end-1977 and will be
completed by September 1978. The Consulting service transferred from the
Second Railway Project are being carried out but additional Technical Assistance
will be still needed to implement the recommendations of the Consultants and
would be financed partly by another donor and partly under a possible Fourth
Bank Project.

tiveness Date: June 15, 1977 (Original Effec-
tiveness Date: January 24, 1977); Closing Date:
June 30, 1981.
Construction started in December 1976 and is proceeding reasonably
well, although there has been a delay in construction of the container berth
due to the need to undertake confirmatory sub soil investigations. A resump-
tion of scheduled progress is expected during 1978. Proposals to incorporate
facilities at the container berth to handle increasing volumes of roll on roll
off traffic have been circulated by the Port Authority to donors. Donors will
also be asked to agree to additional channel dredging under the civil works
contract to enhance project benefits and these proposals will be considered
early in 1978.
Cr. 672                      Plaine des M'Bo Rural Development Project:
US$2.0 million Credit of February 28, 1977;
Effectiveness Date: August 29, 1977; Closing
Date: June 30, 1980.
The 1977 season confirms the seriousness of the technical difficul-
ties that must be solved before full-scale development of the plain can take
place. While progress is being made in testing acceptable levels of mechani-
zation, the resolution of agronomic problems, recently compounded by climatic
fluctuations, has lagged. The agronomic program has been redesigned for 1978.
Ln. No. 1392                 Second Socapalm Project:  US$18.0 million Loan and

1977; Effectiveness Date: November 23, 1977;
Closing Date: June 30, 1982
The loans were declared effective on November 23, 1977 - the due
date.

ness Date: November 14, 1977 (Original Effec-
tiveness Date: September 13, 1977); Closing
Date: December 31, 1980.
The effective date of the Credit was extended from September 13 to
November 14, 1977 to allow for the recruitment of a senior economist by the
Ministry of Agriculture and the Credit was declared effective on that date.
Progress in project coordination and in recruiting long-term advisory consul-
tants is coming about slowly but is now expected to take place more rapidly
in parallel with the recent presentation of a comprehensive action program by
government. Several project-related studies are under active consideration
for financing under the Project.
Cr. No. 723                  Rural Development Fund Project:  US$7.0 million

tiveness date: December 2, 1977); Closing Date:
December 31, 1981.
The project is not yet effective but Government and FONADER are
actively taking measures to meet all prerequisites to that effect. In
particular, the Fonds Special d'Actions Rurales (FSAR) has been created,
the FSAR's bank account has been opened and the required deposit of funds
made, and the Chief Operations Officer has been appointed. It only remains
to select and appoint the FSAR Director. The credit specialist has been
appointed with IDA's approval. FONADER is actively proceeding with the
selection of candidates for other key project posts.
