project is estimated at about -uS$ 7.0 million equivalent, inciuding
interest during construction and working capital.
v.        The proposed loan of US$ 5.0 million equivalent, would cover
about 70% of the total cost of the project. Another loan from the Caisse
Centrale de Cooperation Economique (CCCE) of US$ 1.6 million equivalent,
would cover about 23% of the cost of the project; the balance of about
US$ 0.4 million equivalent would be obtained from SNEC's oam cash genera-
tion. Total foreign exchange costs for the project are estimated at US$
5.0 million equivalent, or about US$ 1.6 million less than foreign
financing provided by the Bank and CCCE.     The financing of local
currency expenditures is proposed in this case based on the economic
situation in the country.
vi.       All material and equipment as well as construction contracts
would be placed after international competitive bidding. The project is
technically sound; estimated costs and the construction schedule are
reasonable.

vii.     SNEC is in a satisfactory financial position, and water rates,
which have recentlv been increased, are adequate. In the future, it is
proposed that SNEC earn a return of at least 10% on net plant in use.
Based on the nresent rates and new rates proposed in the future. the
rate of return on the incremental project investment is estimated to be
about 22% in Dfuala. 131 in Yaounde or 17% overall.

1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Societe Nationale des Eaux du Cameroun, (SNDCj), Douala,
Cameroon has applied for a Bank loan to help finance a project to improve
and expand the water supply facilities in the cities of Douala and
Yaounde. The loan would be guaranteed by the Government of Cameroon.
1.02      In January 1966, the Government of Cameroon requested that the
Bank consider financing a water supply project for the capital city of
Yaounde. A Bank mission examined this proposal first in July 1966, and
found that an expansion of water facilities at Douala was also necessary.
A principal problem evident at the time was that the future organization
of water supply in the two cities was not clearly defined. Another mission
visited the country in April 1967 to assist in clarifying the issues of
organizational structure and the status of a future water authority. SNEC
was established soon thereafter, and has been managing the facilities
since July 1967.
1.03      The main items of work under the project would include the con-
struction at Douala of an additional water treatment plant with a capa-
city of 22,500 m3/day, pumping stations, reservoirs, and additions to
the distribution svstem. At Yaounre. a tiam wonild be constructed to im-
pound water during the rainy season; the treatment plant would be ex-
panded to produce 16.000 m3/mgv more TwAter, and an additional tranqmission
main to the city as well as necessary reservoirs and distribution system

2. THE WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE SECTOR IN CAMEROON
A. Relation to Cameroon's Economv
2.01      The Federal Republic of Cameroon was established in 1961 and
consists of two territories: - East Cameroon, formerly administered
by France and West Caineroon. formerlv administered bv the United
Kingdom. It covers an area of about 475,000 kmn and is about the size
of Flnain or Sweden, Total onnulation is estimated at about 5.4 million
in 1968.  In recent years, population has increased at 2.1% annually.
Population density is about 11.. per km2, but most of the neonle are
concentrated in the north, the south central and western areas.
Density per km2 of agricultlwral land is 31. rameroon has a gross
domestic product of about US$ 860 million or about US$ 160 per capita.
2.02      In Cameroon, there has been substantial migration from rural
areas to the towns and cities.  Urban populationr has increased from about
13% of total in 1959 to about 18% today; population growth in urban
areas is estim-ated to average about 5%.  The total pcpulationJof.ouala,
the country's business and industrial center and principal port, is
2L40,000; Yaounde, the coxixtryls capital since independence in 1960,
has grown very rapidly to 140,000.
2.03      During 1963-1967, average annual growth for the overall economy
has been about 14.7% bbut gro-wth in manufacturing has averaged about 17%
annually.  With the exception of a large aluminum smelter at Edea, about
100 km distant, manufacturing is concentrated in Douala, where industry
is a relatively large consumer of water.
2.04      Due to rapid urban growth, the country is faced with the need to
expand or create water supply facilities in a number of towns. Basic
data on urban areas which have water facilities are given in Annex 1.
For 13 small localities in East Cameroon, the Government has entered into
an agreement with Italy which provides for engineering studies and
supplier credit financing of water facilities. In West Cameroon several
cities have water shortages, and Government is enlisting the assistance
of West Germany for the engineering and perhaps the financing of enlarged
facilities in that part of the country.
2.05      There are no organized sewerage systems in Cameroon.   In the
cities, sewage is either disposed of by septic tanks, seepage pits, or
the storm drainage system.
B. Organization and Administration of lNunicipal lr.,ater Supplies in Cameroon
2.06      Originally, most of the water systems in Cameroon were developed
by the Trusteeship Administrations, often using foreign firms under long-
term "Gerance" or management contracts to build and operate the systems.
In East Cameroon, where Douala and Yaounde are located, the Administration
provided, through budgetary allocation or through foreign grants and
loans, all funds needed for capital works.   Under TGerance" agreements,



-3 -
Government retained full ownership of assets and was ultimately re-
sponsible for profits and losses.    The "Gerances" were remunerated for
the services performed of building the systems and producing and dis-
tributing water, on a cost plus profit basis.    The disadvantages of
these agreements were that there were no incentives to reduce operating
costs or construction c0sts since works were contracted to construction
departments of the same companies without any competitive bidding.    In
addition to all investments being Government financed, unprofitable
operations due to low tariffs often compelled Government to make up
operating losses.
2.07      In 196h, to try to improve the situation, the Government es-
tablished "Societe Provisoire des Eaux du Cameroun" (SPEC), a corporation
administered by the Public lJorks Department with the assistance of
foreign staff.   SPEC was responsible for the water systems of Donala,
Yaounde, Maroua, Nkongsamba and later INlbalmayo.
2.08      In 1965, the Government entered into a two-year "Gerance"
agreement with an association of the two foreign firmips, Societe Enu et
Assainissement (SOCEA) and. Caisse Centrale de Distribution d'Electricite
et d'Eau (GGDfE), which previo"3slv had operated the Douala and Yaounde
systems.   This association operated the systems for SPEC.    The water

Foumban and Kribi were managed under similar "Gerance" contracts by

2.0Q      Tn -Ainc 1967, Societe Nat-ionale Aes Eaux du C-mrou..t (SnNE)
the proposed Borrower, was created in order to regroup in a more orderly
and efficient .MIrMer t'he m,ajor walter supplies of East Cmeoo.   SNE- --- C,ATg
which now operates under "concession" agreements with Government effective
Decerber 1, 1968, started its operations in Juy 1967 by tak-ng ov-er the
"Gerance" agreements for Douala, Yaounde and the nine secondary centers
operated bhyr rCCDEE=SOC1rTA an-, EDC.
2. 10~ Inuu± Isits VCa±te- ouppjly oyjUUris have been mainaged
by the Department of Public IJorkcs of the West Cameroon Government.   Four
cities in East Cameroon - Abong-Nbang, Bafang, Bafia and Garoua - stili
have municipally operated water systems.    The status of all towns with
at-Oer s  ly s.ystMS isnoted on Na_ I and AnlInex 1-.
2.11      It is expected that   NzEC will eventually take over a number of
the other water supply systems in other cities and towns in Cameroon.
howeever, SNECGs management desires to first establish itself firmly in
Douala, Yaounde and -the nine secondary centers presently assigned.   WThen
these units are operating satisfactorily and a good organization estab-
lished, SNEC management will be agreeable to accepting responsibilities
for other systems.    Such other systems probably would be operated on the
basis of concession agreements negotiated at the time.



3.  EXISTING WATER SUPPLY FACILITIES AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM
A. Douala
3.01      Douala, economic center and main port of the Federal Republic
of Cameroon, is the country's largest city and has a population estimated
in 1968 at about 240,000. Douala is located on the Wouri River, 20 km
east of the Atlantic Coast, on the 4th parallel and has a humid equatorial
climate. The city area covers about 60 km2. Douala's water supply is
taken from the Dibamba River, a large tributary of the Wouri. This source
should meet all forseeable future demands.    The present water production
facilities (described in Annex 2), located 12 km east of Douala, built
in 1950 and expanded in 1957, have a rated capacity of about 22,200 m3/
day. An 800 mm transmission main extends to the city supplying storage
reservoirs totalling 5,350 m3 and feeding about 35 km of distribution
pipes ranging in size from 800 mm to 250 mm and 131 km of smaller pipes.
3.02      In Douala. although the system covers the entire area of the
city, only about 15% of the population lives in houses supplied with
water. The rest of the population is supnlied by carrving water from
public taps. This is the result of the high cost of water connections,
past management's reluctance to connect un lower-class houses because of
difficulties in collecting accounts and restricted quantities of water
available, as well as relatively high water rates.
3.03      The nual ity of Douala water i   ex aynl l-nt.- in the past, supply
has been continuous and pressure in the system adequate. Due to the

include production facilities with a 16,000 m3/day capacity at Mopfou,
a 50U mm pipeline to the city, a booster pumping station, storage reser-
voirs totalling 4,250 m3, 1 km of distribution pipes ranging in size
from 700 mm to 200 mm, and about 91 km of smaller pipes.

' Water cons-aziwipt±uon statistics (unlnex j3j) sbow tlJaL as iin £&Aual a,
municipal public taps and Government consumption represent about 45 to 50%
of total consumption, thus stressing the importance of Governeritl and
municipal accounts. In general, water quality is good, the exception
being water taken from some badly designed public taps where pollution
may occur. At present, a program of distribution works financed by the
CCCE is almost complete and will extend the distribution network to new
residential districts. Water supply is continuous but pressure in parts
of the system is low and water shortages will persist until the new pro-
duction and transmission facilities, to be provided by the project, are
completed.
C. Development Program - iater Supply
3.07      Over the period 1969-71, SNEC proposes to invest about US$ 10
million equivalent to expand and improve its water supply systems and in-
crease its working capital (see paragraph 7.01 for details). Except for
the project in Douala and Yaounde, no other firm plans have yet been made.
The proposed project is the main component of the development program
and represents about 70% (US$ 7.0 million) of the programts cost.    The
balance is for buildings, small extensions of distribution networks and
connections (US$ 1.1 million), completion of a prior program (US$ 0.8
million) and working capital of US$ 1.0 million in addition to that in-
cluded in the project.

4.  THE pROJT'rT
A. Description
4.01      The proposed project, based on engineering and feasibility
studies pr-epared by SNEC and t-wo French Consul tarits (Bureau Central
d'Etudes pour les Equipements d'Outre Mer (BCEOM), and Electricite de
France (EDF), will expand and improve the water supply an'd distribution
systems of Douala and Yaounde. A detailed project description is given
in Annex 4;  locations of the proposed works are shown on .`ap 2 for
Douala, and Map 3 for Yaounde.
h.02      Tne Douala sub-project provides for expansion of the production
facilities at Japoma and for additional reservoirs and main distribution
lines. The capacity of the system will be almost doubled and should
satisfy Douala's demand up to about 1978.  The works will include a treat-
ment plant, nominallx designed for 15,000 m3/day, but with an effective
capacity of 22,500 m-/day, low and high lift pumping stations, two 5,000
m3 reservoirs with booster pumping stations, and about 7 km of distribu-
tion pipe in diameters ranging from 350 mm to 500 mm.
4.03      The Yaounde sub-project provides for construction of a 15 m
high earth dam to provide a 5 million m3 reservoir, a new 16,000 m3/day
treatment plant, a pumping station and an 8.3 km transmission main
to carry the water to the city,,a new booster pumping station, distribu-
tion mains, and two new 3,000 m' reservoirs. The project will double the
capacity of the Yaounde water system and allow demand up to about 1980
to be met.
B. Cost of Project
8.04      Total cost of the project is estimated to be about CFAF 1,737
million equivalent to about US$ 7.0 million, including interest during
construction and increased working capital requirements due to the
project during the construction period (increased accounts receivable
and inventories reflecting, expanded operations). Foreign exchange costs
of the project represent about US$ 5 million equivalent or 70% of total
cost. Cost estimates, summarized below, are given in detail in Annex 5
along with quarterly expenditures during the construction period.
Assumptions used for estimating the foreign exchange component are shown
in Annex 6.

total foreign exchange cost of the project (us$5.0 million), because of
the joint financing with CCCE, another foreign source, and the pari-passu
disbursement, the Bank will in effect finance local costs amounting to
about US$1.1 million.

5.  JUSTIFICATION
5.01      The Government gives high priority to the provision of ade-
quate water supply to Douala as Cameroon's commercial and industrial
center, and to Yaounde as its capita.   TLn both cities the existing water
facilities are fully utilized and shortages are experienced during the
months of high demand and periods of peak flows. Tne proposed project
would nearly double water supply production facilities in each city, and
meet requirements until 1978-1980.   if the wrater supply systems are not
expanded, Douala's industrial and commercial growth will be hampered, as
will also the capital's development. Lack of adequate water from a public
system would result in the outright elimination of some development and
would cause individuals or companies to attempt to obtain water in other
ways and at higher gross cost to the country.
5.02      From 1956 to 1968, the population of Douala has increased at
an average rate of about 5% per year, due to annual growth as well as in-
tensive migration from other parts of Cameroon. During the last five
years, water demand has increased at a higher rate of about 8% annually,
but in the last three years, the increase wqas more than 10% annually,
primarily due to industrial development. About 34% of sales are to in-
dustry. For the future, it is estimated that water demand will increase
at a rate of 9-10% annually in Douala. Past consumption and forecasts of
demand are shown in Annex 8.
5.03      In Yaounde, ponulation growth since 1960 has been at an average
rate of about 8% per year, and water demand has increased comparably.
This reflects the establishment of Yaotnnde as the nationts capital and
intensive migration. It is expected that growth of water demand will con-
tinue to hb at a rate of about 8%.  Past consurunptinn and forecasts of
demand are shown in Annex 9.
5.04      As mentioned in paragraph 3.02, in the past new connections to
the T.e.ar systems have been discoliraged. The in rpaqed canacitv of the
systems after expansion will allow SNEC to encourage new connections and
management inntends to promote cornections to lower  lass houses, thereby
increasing the population served conveniently, as long as collections

systems are expanded to provide sanitary water to meet the increased needs.



- Il I
,.o6      As noted later in this report (paragraph 6.21), water rates
are expected to be increased substantially.   It is unlikely that this
will result in a reduction of demand of any significant magnitude. Me
majority of the population obtains water from public taps and does not
pay for water on a usage basis, although the municipality does.
Domestic consumers normally have quite high incomes and are not ex-
pected to reduce their usage as rates are increased. Industry and
business are also expected to maintain past water usage habits although
it is possible that higher rates would result in some water conservation
practice on the part of industry.
5.07      Alternative sources of water for Yaounde were considered by the
consultants before deciding on the proposed project; for Douala, the
present source is large enough to be utilized further. Selections of the
many different components of the proposed project were based on economic
evaluations of alternatives using a discount rate of 9%.
5.08      The incremental rate of return for the proposed project is
estimated to be about 17%, about 22% for the Douala sub-project and 13%
for Yaounde, (see Annex 10). These financial rates of return are calcu-
lated by valuing the water sold at its proposed selling price. The project's
economic return may exceed this since the value of water to most consumers
is higher than its price. Consumers' alternative methods of obtaining
water are much more costly than the supply of water through the proposed
water system.



6.  THE BORR0WE
A. Organization and Management
6.01      5i-EC is a corporation created in June 1967 to consolidate a
number of water agencies operating in East Cameroon. SNEC has a total
share capital of CFA' 100 million and its shareholders are the Cameroon
Government and political sub-divisions (22%), CCCE (11%), and EDC (67%).
The main shareholders of EDC are the Cameroon Government 51%, CCCE 37%
and EDF 5%.
6.02      SNEC is administered by a board of 12 mambers elected by the
shareholders. Government, through its direct holdings and its control
of EDC, can appoint the maj-ority on the Board.  SNEC has entered into
a service contract with EDC whereby EDC's management is actually re-
sponsible for SIEC operations, and SWEC will share staff with EDC with
costs prorated between the two organizations.
6.03      EDC was created in 1963, and has concessions for supplying
power in the same municipalities as SNEC has for water. EDC also shares
management with ENELCAM which produces electricity at a plant in Edea
and has only two customers, EDC and ALUCAM - an aluminum producer. The
integration of personnel reflects the integration of the public utilities
systems at the senior level of management, and the special relationships
between EDC and SEC.   The main advantages of these arrangements are to
provide SNEC with a highly competent management already successful in
Cameroon public utilities, to coordinate operations between water and
power seetors and to economize on overhead and operating costs of the
organizations.
6.04      Because of the SIEC/EDC service contract, the General Manager
of EDO is also the General Manager of SNEG. MEDfl. Gfeneral Manager is
appointed by the EDC Board, on the proposal of the Board member who
renresents EDF.  (Actually; the General Manager is an EDF staff member
assigned to Cameroon on a long-term contract.)   He exercises most
powers on a day-to-day basis, and is assisted by three senior executives in
charge of technical operations, finance, and administration. Since EDCO S
management is a knowm quan-tity and has performed well. it is to SNC' s
benefit that this management carry on its operations. It has been agreed
th--t tl.e p- ,--en s-rlie cor.tract bet.en EDO and S.hTEC .2ii not be
modified or cancelled without Dank approval, and that changes of the
General 'I-Inger wil;l be nAde only after prior conaultation ith the
Bank.
6.05      SNEC employs 369 people including staff shared with EDC (and,
through EDC, ENEIAM) . Ar. organization chart with a manpower smnmary
is given in Annex 11. Staff is sufficient and not excessive for the
contemplated level of operatiOnS.

currently performed by SNEC, is expected to be sub-contracted to local
contractors in the future. This will decrease the number of artisans
employed by Sli-.m In aondte, wnere many new connections ana extensions arie
being made, total manpower of the center is scheduled to decrease from the
present 152 to 77 by 1972. It is expected that this reduction wili be
aacomplished through attrition and reassignment of personnel to other cities.
6.07      SNEC plans to use its staff for supervising project construction.
Engineers will be those who supervised costruction of Mbakaou Dam for EDC.
This small technical control department will be common to EDC and SNEC.
6.08      Most of the executives are French (a total of 31).  All four
top executives are French, as well as five of the other eight senior
executives. African foremen, however, about equal their foreign counter-
parts. For upper levels, SNEC plans to recruit and train, in Cameroon
and in France, African Personnel and hopes with time to reduce the number
of foreigners employed. To overcome difficulties in recruiting qualified
African personnel at low and middle levels, SNEC has created a school to
train water treatment technicians and plans to adopt the same methods of
training now in use by EDC. EDC, in addition to its technical school
(5 instructors teaching 3 to 6 month courses to 80 students per class),
sends the best students to France to complete their studies in schools
run by EDF. These arrangements appear satisfactory and no funds are in-
cluded for personnel training in the Bank loan.
6.09      Personnel recruitment goes through a Governmental Agency "Office

agencies SNRr presently has three diffront. t.vnP of conventions bht.
is in the process of adopting a uniform convention tailored after EDC's.
The future convention is deemed at least as liberal as those used in

a conmercial basis and with full legal and profit responsibility.    Three
concessions have been granted to SNEC - one for Douala, one for 7aounde
and one for the nine secondarv centers. Each concession states SNEC's
rights and obligations to the Government and the customers.    The con-
cession documents, already reviewed bv the Bank. were signed NIovember 30,
1968 and became effective December 1, 1968. Both Government and SNEC
will guarantee that the concessions will not be cancelled or modified or
new concessions added without prior Bank approval.    From all present
indications, evidenced bv EDOts performance   SIEC will relieve the Govern-

6.13      As required by the Government, in 1968, SNEC presented separate
finsnc±al statements for each wa.ter operation and the Centra.l Services
but no consolidated statements. Under the "Gerance"' Statutes there were
eXtensive irlter=conpaqy transfers, the Central SerVice-s acting aS a bank
for the different centers. SNEC plans to eliminate inter-company trans-

mentv has beern fairly successful, Ln lYaounde especially, but it is too
early for results to be fully conclusive. Outstanding receivables for
private customers average about one mortlh due to a rigid SNEC/EDO policy
of cutting water and power when bills are overdue.  Such receivables are
more than covered by required customer deposits.
6.17      Bills rendered to Goverrment are settled slowly; in the past,
an average of eight months receivables have been outstanding. The Central
and territorial Governments have normally paid more quickly than have
the municipalities. To facilitate and speed up the collection from the
Governmient, SNEC/LDC requested that the Treasury centralLize the payment
of its power and water bills. This was approved in October 1968. Govern-
ment has agreed that governmental accounts for water billed by STNEC
before June 30, 1969 will be settled by December 31, 1969 and that in the
future it will pay or cause to be paid promptly, its bills or the bills
of its political subdivisions.

owned by or rented to the customers, but in the future customer owner-

meter which in turn is determined by the size of the connection.
Differen.t rate stu ructures apply to domestic connectionQ, industrial
customers, public fountains and Government.  Government and domestic
rates are the sam-,e, with lower rates Ior puDiiC fountains and volume
discounts for industry.  There are no exemptions from payment of rates
ad rno discrimnatory prices.
6.21      tMTew rates ar-e incl-uded as part of  cocesso-wre
approved on Movember 30, 1968 and became effective on December 1, 1968.
Th&e new rates are about 30o0 zugiler than recent rates.  Another rate
increase of about 40% is projected, at the time of project completion.
D- 1973, projected rates will be sufficient to provide a return on net
plant in service of about 12%, with increasing returns thereafter.
r-oposed rates as well as past rates are noted in Annex 12.

u .c*     in the concession agreements, a eeiling water rate is establisned;
this ceiling rate is adjusted according to a number of economic indices.
SNEC can establish its rates at or below tnis ceiling at its discretion
and in fact now projects that it will only charge 95% of the ceiling rate.

In tne zuuure, i; can 'e expected tnat if rates cnargea resuit in
excessive cash generation, water rates will be reduced below those
used in projections (Government nas a major,ty on SNECs Boaral.
6.23      In the case of development of the distribution system, the
interested customers are required to both pay for the extension of the
distribution pipes in new areas and for the comnection to the main.
As an alternative to paying for extending the distribution system,
customers may sometimes guarantee minimum water sales for five years,
based on the distribution pipe diameter.
E. Water Rate and Cost Levels
6.24      The water rates allowed under the concessions are very high,
equivalent to approximately US$ 1.00 per thousand US gallons after project
completion, or over double the rates charged under comparable conditions
in most developing countries. This reflects a high general cost structure
in Cameroon, and high estimates of costs by SNEC to be on the safe side
when past operating and cost data are either non-existent or of question-
able accuracy. Power costs are high because of very high electricity
tariffs. Chemical costs reflect the high cost of importation and merchant
mark-up. Salaries, especially those for the foreigners, are high to
comnensate for the hiah cost nf living and to attract Euroneans to the
country. Acministrative and general expenses reflect high general cost
level s. and t-he high nost of fringe henefits for nersonnel.  Spare narts
and maintenance costs are a function of high investment costs and, in
addition. nrobablv have been over-estimated to provide a safety factor.

6.26       The water rates proposed also result in 51sbistantial retr1-ns

F.  Taxes
6.27      SNEC as a corporation will be subject to income and other
taxes except import duties.
G. Financial Position
Balance Sheet
6.28      The estimated balance sheet as of June 30, 1968 is provided in
Annex 13. This balance sheet has been prepared from available data and
has not been audited; meaningful financial statements prior to 1968 are
not available. The balance sheet shows a satisfactory position. Long-
term debt to lenders, other than the Government, total CFAF 54 million
on original loans of CFAF 196 million, or 3% of total equity. No major
borrowing was made between 1958 and 1967. The limited investments were
made through internal generation of cash or Government grant. The last
two borrowings were CFAF 9 million in 1967 for improvement of Mbalmayo
and CFAF 190 million in fiscal 1969 for Yaounde. Both loans were made
by CCCE. The current ratio at 2.8 is satisfactory.
Past Income
6.29      Income statements for 1967 and 1968 are summarized in Annex 1L.
Operations were barely profitable with return on assets in use only
about 1%.
Adontion of I\NEfl' Glonessions
6.30      'ovaymyent is now undertaking a settlement of all accournts
with the various "Gerances", which operated the systems up until
DeeQmhper 1968  Thins settlment is expected to take place over a period
of two years. During this period, SNEC will liquidate "Gerance" accounts
for the rinver.m.ent. Goverr-ent has a-reed tlr-t ar.r accounts to bn

m=''..Lon ku± .lyF ofL requir±enents), ari cusrioirLer cont,rLbutions (FrAr 1525
million) cover the balance.   Requirements include a build-up of cash of
CFAr 178 million which provides a cushion if adverse events develop or if
expansion programs must be undertaken in the secondary centers.
7.03      The proposed Bank loan of US$5.0 million is assumed to carry
interest at -< and be amortized over 20 years, including a grace period
of 3 years.   The CCCE project loan is expected to carry 4h  interest,
with amortization over 15 years including 3 years grace; the CCCE project
loan on satisfactory terms and conditions would be a condition of effect-
iveness.
7.o4      The proposed Bank loan includes interest during construction;
CCCE policy does not allow for this and interest on its loans must
be paid from operations.   Interest during construction on the Bank loan
is justified on the basis that were it not included, the funds would
have to be borrowed elsewhere to arrive at a conservative financial plan.
7.05      This financing plan is satisfactory.   Government has agreed
to make available or cause to be made available, on terms and conditions
satisactory to the Bank, any funds needed to complete the project in
the event of a project over-run or insufficient cash generation by SNEC.
B. Financial Projections
7.06      Estimated Income Statements are shown in Annex 15.  The fore-
casts are based on the water rates noted in Annex 12; assumptions for
all financial forecasts are included in Annex 18.   Included on Dages 2-4
of Annex 15 are income statements for Douala, Yaounde, and the secondary
centers separately.   Returns on assets are adequate for each city.
7.07      Estimated Balance Sheet Projections for 1969-1975 are shown in
Annex 17.   These show the accounts projected under the concession agree-
ments, and are not a carrv-forward of the 1968 statement.s whinh were on A
tGeranceI1 basis.  Valuation of fixed assets has been estimated and must
be confirmed by a Dhvsical inventorv and val uatiAon which is to be completed
by June 30, 1970.   The financial position is satisfactory.   Long-term
debt is not expected to exceed )i1 of' onanital and will decrease rapidy
after 1972.
7.08      If the water rates assumed are maintained, the return after
taxes on net fixed assets (excluding distrhiio+rn pipes and conections
financed by customers) increases substantially over the years from 10%
in 1973.   The flovPrnmPent nnd SNEC have agreed that the water rates
be maintained so that a minimum return of 10% on net fixed assets
(excluring customer contributed pipes and connectior.) be achieved



- 21 -
after 1972.   (The percent return required could be altered in the future
when valuation of assets and futiire financial rpniirmpents are known=)
Net fixed assets are defined as assets in use at the beginning of
the year and will be readjiusted in accordance with econoicndi49ces.
The current value of SNEC's physical assets will be determined as
TnAntiAnno  in naragraph 7  to establish +he    -t        . ,,-1 1k
June 1970, in a manner acceptable to the Bank.
7.09      SNEC's cash position is more than sufficient.    The current
ratio is abovre 4.0 for the period 196,-1975.   ,n the projections, pro-
vision has been made for new investments which are not yet defined.
7.10      The debt service coverage as evidenced by the cash flow fore-
cast in Annex 16 is abo-ve 2.4 for the period i969-i975;  this is more
than adequate.   For future programs, SNEC is not allowed to incur
fuAUMe. deebt unfess past not. revenues after operating costs are at
least 1.5 times the maximum debt service requirement projected.

8. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMIYJENDATIONS
8.01      The proposed project offers the most practical and economic
sonliition for the  mater suiply problem..s in Til n andi Vaouinde, and nro-
vides sufficient water to meet requirements up to about the years
1978-1980.   The proposed project woulnd ield an additional suinppl of
22,500 m3/day at Douala and 16,000 m3/day at Yaounde;  it also would

water rates should provide for an adequate earnings position.
8.03      During negotiation of the proposed Bank loan, it was agreed
that
(a)  S1iEC will have acquired all land necessary as a condition
of loan effectiveness; Government will not allow contami-
nation of project wiater sources (paragraph 4.12);
(b) Changes in the General Manager position will be made only
after prior consultation with the Bank, and changes in the
service contract between ShTEC and EDC will only be made
with Bank approval (paragraph 6.04);
(c)  Both Government and SNEC guarantee that the concession
agreements will not be increased, cancelled or modified
without Bank approval (paragraph 6.10);
(d)  SNEC will discuss the concession arrangements with the Bank
from time to time in order to improve them.   SNEC will submit
its annual investment program to the Bank for approval during
project construction and for comments thereafter (paragraph
6.12);
(e)  Government and its municipalities will settle their old bills
outstanding by December 31, 1969 and will keep accounts current
in the future (paragraph 6.17);
(f)  Government has aereed that "Gerance"t or other accounts
assumed by SNEC would be subject to audit when "Geranee"
accounts are settled (paragraph 6.30);
(g) The loan from GCCE will be on satisfantorv terms and   onnditions
and will be a condition of loan effectiveness (paragraph 7.03);
(j)  SNEC and Government will discuss tariff policies with the
BP2nk t the tinme of project completionn nd from timae to
time thereafter (paragraph 6.26).   Except as the Bank shall



- 23 -
othenrise agree, rates will be maintained so that a
minimum return of 10% on net plant in use can be realized
after project completion; SNEC iwill carry out a physical
inventory and valuation to establish the initial rate base
acceptable to the Bank no later than June 1970 (paragraph 7.08);
(kc) Except as the Bank shall otherwise agree, SNEC will not incur
any debts in the future unless past net revenues are at
least 1.5 times the maximum debt service requirements to be
incurred (paragraph 7.10).
8.04      The proposed project is suited for a Bank loan of US.$5 million
equivalent for a period of 20 years, including a grace period of 3 years.

DOUALA AND YAOUNDE TWATER  JPPLY PROJECT
Existina Facilities
I.  DOUALA
Douala, the principal city of the Federal Republic of Cameroon,
had about 200,500 inhabitants in July 1-614.  Th recent years, ruiilation
has increased at a rate of about 5% per year. The port, on the mouth of
the Wouri R.iver, services all of East Cameroon and a large part of the
Republic of Chad. In 1950 a modern water supply was constructed at
Japoma, 12 k.- east of Tuala.  .Preriously, te C41 -     s     ed Iy we lls.
This limited source is used by the Cameroon breweries.
he water is take-n from the Dibamba River, a tributary of the
Wouri, whose large flow should meet all forseeable future demand.
The Japoma facilities consist of two treatment plants built in
1950 and 1957.  Tne first plant Dve remont), wqith eight pressure filters,
was designed to treat about 7,200 m-/day. Pump sets include four bO
1/second pumps.
The second plant (SOCEAj, designed for 15,000 ms/day, includes
an intake structure, a 500 mm raw water main, a low lift station with
three pump sets of 90 !/second, a chemical building, two settling basins,
each with a volume of about 1,000 m3, eight gravity filters with a total
surface of 160 mi2, a 500 m3 clear well, and a pumping station with three
90 1/second sets pumping against a head of 50 m into the 800 mm trans-
mission main to Douala.
B. Operation of Plant
In the SOCEA Plant, coagulation is obtained with aluminum sul-
fate (25 grams/m3) and lime (8 grams/m3).  Turbidity of the raw water is
about 15 and after filtration the effluent has a turbidity of 0.1. Wash
water represents about 2.5% when the filters operate at a rate of 4 to 5
m3/m2/hour. Tests with activated silica have demonstrated that a rate of
8 m3/m2/hour could be achieved without affecting the water quality, but
at this rate wash water losses are tripled. Power consumption in 1967
was 0.285 kwh/m3. Chlorination requires about 2.5 grams of chlorine per
m3 of water treated.

pairs due to the severe corrosion of all filter bottoms, provoked by the
lack of a proper liume feedUng system.   Due to its higher operating costs
and difficulty in keeping the quality of the effluent constant, this plant
is used as a stand-.by unit.
c. Transmission and Distribution Facilities
An 800 mm cast iron transmission main, 9.8 km long, with two
surge towers, carries water from Japoma to the reservoirs at Douala-Bassa,
water is pumped to the first surge tower, then goes on by gravity to the
elevated reservoirs at Douala-Bassa.
Douala's storage facilities include:
two 1,500 m3 elevated reservoirs at Bassa

and 131.  km of smaller diameter pipes.
II. YAOUNDE
Yaounde, capital of the Federal Republic of Cameroon, had about
120.000 inhabitants in January 1966 and in recent years nonollation has
increased at a rate in excess of 8% per year. The water supply of Yaounde
was built in 195O (SOcEA nlant.) and   panded A  in 1962 anti 19)1 (flJparpemnnf
plants).
A. Production Facilities
The water is taken from the Mefou River at Mopfou, 8 km to the
west of Yaitnden   The Mpefou River is a small stream with ar. nverage flo-wP
of about 720 liters per second and a low flow of 140-150 liters per second.

The Mopfou facilities consist of two treatment plants buut 'n
1950 and 1962-1964. The first facilities (SOCEA) are of the same type as
in Douala, but with only half the size and capacity (7,>00 m3/day). They
include: an intakq structure on the Mefou to take a minimum of 140
1/second (12,500 mrn/day) even in the dry season; a low lift pump station
with two 145 1/second pumps; a chemical building;   two settling basins
and four filters. The recent addition (Degremont) designed for about
8,000 m3/day includes two upAlow floculat4on units and six filters with a
total filtering area of 72 me. Two 500 m; reservoirs provide for clear
water storage and wash water. A pumping station (elev. 699) with four
sets of 60 1/second pump lifts the water about 60 m to Yaounde (Messa).
B. Transmission and Distribution Facilities
Facilities include a 500 mm oest iron transmission main, 7.8 km
long, that carries water from Mopfou to Messa.
Storaee facilities include a 2.500 m3 ground reservoir at Messa
(elev. 760.3); a 1,000 m3 ground reservoir at Atamenge (elev. 795), and
a 750 m3 elevated reservoir at the Presbyterian Mission (elev. 799). A
booster station at Messa with four 40 1/second pumps supplies the reser-
voirs at Atamenge and the Mission.,

day capacity, to give Douala a total production capacity of 45,000 m3/day.
The project will achieve the same goals at a much reduced cost.1/
Hydraulic capacity of the existing 800 mm transmission main will be in-
creased to about 55,000 m3/day by construction at Bassa of a ground reser-
voir with a booster pumping station. This increases the head availanie
for friction losses, and consequently the carrying capacity of the
existing transmission main.   The second main will therefore not be needed.
The capacity of the existing treatment plant which had been
nominally designed for 15,000 m3/day, can be increased to about 22,500 m3!
day by the use of coagulation aids. A duplicate unit will be built and,
during the dry season when demand is highest, with coagulation aids, its
capacity will also be about 22,500 m-3/day. The increased capacity of the
existing and one new treatment unit make unnecessary the construction of
a second new unit.
The distribution system will be improved by the construction
of adequate storage capacity (10,000 m3) and by the installation of key
sections of trunk distribution mains.
1/ About US$ 1.75 million will be saved.

II. YAOUNDE
In Yaounde the source of supply will be a 5 million m3 reser-
voir created by the construction of the Mopfou Dam on the Mefou River
whose regulated flow (after construction of a dam) is estimated at
720 l/second (60,000 m3/day).   The project includes the dam, a treat-
ment plant of 16,000 m3/day capacity, pumping stations, a transmission
main from Mopfou to Yaounde, reservoirs and some major distribution
trunk lines.
The source of supply, the Mefou River at Mopfou, was selected
after a study of possible development of sources available showed that
projected operating costs, as well as capital costs, were lower for the
Mopfou scheme than for any other scheme. This source of supply is ex-
pected to satisfy Yaounde's demand until about 1986, when estimated
average raw water requirements are expected to reach 55,000 m3/day.
Project facilities should satisfy demand for about 10 years, when,in a
second stage, treatment and transmission facilities will have to be ex-
panded. After 1986, SNEC plans to use the Nyona River, 40 km south of
Yaounde, as a source of supply.
A. Mopfou Dam
This structure designed by EDF consists of about 120,000 m3 of
compacted laterite with a height of about 15 m. and a length of about
200 m.  A concrete structure built upstream of the dam will include a
morning glory spillwav. an intake structure and sluice gates.
A e-onrerte aolley I j th raw water ei,ctsz o.rf_owj and sluice
ducts will run under the dam to a control chamber. A ductile iron pipe-

three raw water and three clear water pumps, two filter wash water pumps,
one air compressor, chemical feeders at Mopfou and two booster pumps at
Messa.
D. Electrical Equipment
Transformers and electric control equipment for the facilities
at Mopfou and Messa and liaison cables between Mopfou and Messa.
E.  Pipes and Fittings
(i)  Supply of pipes and fittings for:  about 950 m of 700 mm ductile
iron pipe to convey raw water to the Mopfou treatment plant, about 8.3 km
of 600 mm ductile iron pipe for a transmission main from Mopfou to Messa,
and about 600 m of 500 mm ductile iron pipe for modification to the existing
transmission main and connection to the main distribution trunk line. All
these pipe sizes were selected after a comparison of alternatives showed
them to be the most economical solution using discount rates of 9%.
(ii) Installation of above.
F. Reservoirs
Construc+ion of a 3jQ00 m3 elevated cencrete reservoir and of a
3,000 m3 concrete ground reservoir to provide Yaounde with an adequate
storage -apaci+ey*. TP  selectiorn of the elevated reservoir was made after
economic comparisons showed that in Yaounde, an elevated reservoir of
3,000 m3 is more economical than    a  3,000 33 ground resertroir wTith a booster
station.
G. Distribution System
(i) Supply of pipes and fittings for about 1.4 km of 600 mm ductile
iron p4pe, 1.9 Ai- of 500  l p:pe, and 1.6 kme of 450 A. ductAle pipe.  The
sizes of these pipes were determined for the Master Plan by computer

Determination of Foreign Exchange Costs
1.        The proposed project would be implemented through fifteen con-
tracts; eight civil work contracts and seven equipment supply contracts,
2.        For civil work contracts, the foreign exchange cost component
was estimated by computing the foreign exchange portion of each of the
main parts of these contracts as follows:

3.        For equipment supply contracts, the amount of foreign exchange
cost represents the estimated C.I.F. DOUALA cost of the goods. This cost
represents 95% of the suDDlv contracts. The remaining 5% represents port
handling and local transport costs.  These percentages were derived from
the estimates of SNEGC and are based on EDC's past experience for similar
work.
4.        The foreign exchange percentages, calculated as above, were then
anplied to the reAspective coomponrent of eaeh of the contracts to obtain the
foreign exchange costs shown in Annex 5.

Notes on Incremental Rate of Return
(1) The investment costs include distribution systue,m expenditures which
will be necessary to serve new areas and increase water sales.
(2) Project costs include contingencies and price escalation.
(3) Retail water sales assume 20% unaccounted-for water which is the
estimated loss at present.
(4) Incremental revenues have been calculated assuming the same average
rates as used in the projected income statements.

Notes on Balance Sheet - June 30, 1968
The Balarice "--eet as of Junle 30, 1968 was -establishe-1d fr-om
available data and is now being audited.    Audit is not expected to
change the statements significantly. This balance sheet is on a
"Geranceu" basis.
Plant in service has been carried at book value without
readjustments;  the readjusted value could be 2uC nigher.    At LIx±e
negotiations it must be agreed that SNEC will make a complete physical
inventory and revaluation of assets.    Plant does not include distribution
pipes and connections paid by the customers.
Accounts receivable are high.   Other accounts receivable are
mainly due to the "Gerances" by Societe Provisoire des Eaux du Cameroun
(SPEC) or the Government because SPEC was a branch of the Government.
These accounts are being settled along with the others since the con-
cessions were signed.   Other accounts receivable include also certain
sums due SNEC by EDC.
Long-term debts include loans made by the Government at
various stages of the "Gerances" history; these do not carry any
interest.   Terms of loans by CCCE are noted in Annex 18.
Other assets and other liabilities are principally accounts
with Government or past "Gerances" which are expected to be settled
over the next two years.

DOUALA AND YAOUNDE WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
SOCIETE NATIONALE DES EAUX DU CAMEROUN
Assumptions For Financial Forecasts
1.        All income and balance sheet forecasts were generally based on
projections developed by SNEC and reviewed at the time of the appraisal
mission.
Income Statements
2.        Unaccounted-for water is the difference between water produced
and water sold.
3.        In addition to revenues based on consumDtion. other revenues to
cover maintenance of connections and rental and maintenance of meters are
included. Revenues from meters increase sienificantlv (from CFAF 5. mil-
lion in 1970 to CFAF 28.8 in 1975) as meters now owned by customers are
progressively replaced. SNEC's rental and maintenance charae is mlGh
higher than past maintenance charged on customer owned meters. In addi-
tion, SNEC collects an installation fee for the new meters. Extension
of distribution systems and new connections are paid by the customers.
Returns from those works are estimated at 14% of the total cost to the
customers;  these profits are included in non-operating income.
4.        Power costs are based on 1968 price levels with quantities ad-
insted to reflect increased or decreased power requiremer.ts. Po-er cost
increases slightly in Douala after 1970 to reflect the increased power
rerni-ired to rnim,p increased water thro m> t-e - s+ing tra.mission line.

At Yaounde, power cost decreases after the completion of the Mefou Dam
since the wat-er levrel will be rv-4 sed and less po1e r f ,r ip n-gp in  4  re,,-e-.

Doual _- an-d v.a'o unde.  Th.Lese  C09tS are netlu of duLtieJK1s as thel duty exem,pt
should be extended to SNEC under the concession agreements.
6.        Spare parts and maintenance reflect SNEC's intent to introduce

7.        The projections of labor costs are based on nresent staffing
levels. These costs are increased 5% per year to reflect promotional
increases.
8.        Administrnt4ve exynPnses and qAArioq are increased 7% a yr-
Total central administrative expenses and salaries are increased 15% a
year to take acrouint of the increasing num.ber of accounts annd new
accounting, billing and collecting systems. Central expenses and
salaries are allor.te tio eaerh cnter on +.he basi Oi f the' Gent's
revenues.
9.        Depreciation averages 3.5% of total gross assets.   In addition,

10.       The balance sheet t  UUconider that thu concessions have been signed.
The 1969 base balance is estimated but audit would not be expected to change
±1.      r~lnt in service is Dasea on the DOOK value oI tne plant carriea
adjusted for cost increases. This new value does not, however, correspond
to a replacement value and must be reassessed after complete physical in-
ventory. Total plant includes also distribution pipes and connections at
cost paid by the customers.
12.       Inventories will be transferred to SNEC by the Government but SNEC
will not receive past accounts receivable. Accounts receivable are conser-
vatively forecast based on past experience: private and industrial accounts -
2 months; Government - 8 months. More prompt payment by Government as
required under the loan covenants would reduce accounts receivable and
increase cash balances.
13.       Of total equity, only CFAF 100 million has been paid in by share-
holders and will be eligible for dividends of 5%. The balance represents
mainly assets contributed by Government and customer contributions with
retained earnings increasing over time.
14.       SNEC carries all long-term debts contracted by the "Gerances" but
none of the past current liabilities.   The various loans are:
1954 - CCCE Loan CFAF 100 million at 3% and 20 years for Douala.
1957 - CCCE Loan CFAF  53 million at 3% - 14½ years for Ebolowa.
1958 - CCCE Loan CFAF   34 million at 2.5% - 1h½ years for Kribi.
1967 - CCCE Loan CFAF    9 million at 5% - 7 years for Nbalmayo.
1968 - CCCE Loan CFAF 190 million at 3.5% - 10 years for Yaounde.
