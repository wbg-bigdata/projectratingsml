Key Outcome         Four key outcome indicators have been drawn from a larger
Indicators           constellation of indicators that the Government has established
                     for itself to guide future implementation and strengtheningof its
                    program. For December,2011,these indicators include:

                     0  The National System for          Disaster Management and
                       Prevention will continue to address the needs of, on average,
                        at least 80 percent o f people in disaster affected areas that
                       request support.

                     0 Expand the number of municipalities that have disaster risk
                       management plans. On October 1, 2008, 10 municipalities
                       have disaster risk managementplans.

                     0 There will be a reduction inthe numberof people living inthe
                       high hazard zone of the Galeras volcano; on October 1, 2008,
                       7,935 people lived inthe highhazardzone.

                     0 The Government will have defined a framework for
                       contingent financing. On October 24, 2008, the Government
                       passed a policy document (CONPES 3545) providing the
                       basis for such a framework.

ProgramDevelopment   This operation would support policy and institutional reforms to
Objective(s) and     addressthe following objective:
Contribution to CAS      T o strengthen the Government's program for reducing
                         risks resultingfrom adversenaturalevents.
                     The DPL with a CAT DDO has been designed to provide a
                     financing bridge to funds from other sources. The operation i s a
                     natural follow-on to the Bank's existing engagement in disaster
                     risk management through the disaster vulnerability reduction
                     APL series, and is derived directly from Colombia's National
                     Development Plan.

Risks and Risk       The proposed operation supports an institutional effort widely
Mitigation           perceived necessary and which the Government i s already
                     actively implementing, in part with support from the Bank
                     through two previous lending operations. This CAT DDO will
                     replace an existing contingent line of credit included as a
                     component in the Disaster Vulnerability Reduction APL 1
                     (P082429). Some risks directly related to this operation include:

                            Implementation o f the policy reform program may be
                            hamperedby lack o f coordination among agencies. Over
                            the last four years, however, coordination has improved
                            and experience under the existing APLs demonstrates that
                            multi-agency cooperation has reached satisfactory levels.
                            Inthe context of APL 1 and APL 2, the Bank is working
                            with all involved agencies to improve coordination
                            further. Thusthis risk is perceived to bemoderate.

                            The procedures for disbursement could prove difficult to
                            implement rapidly. The Bank will continue to work
                            closely with the Government to ensure arrangements are
                            inplace for prompt disbursement. This riskis perceived to
                            be low.

                            The possibility of an economic downturn - e.g., from a
                            decline inexports to main trading partners- could make it
                            more difficult for the Government to devote resources to
                            disaster risk reduction and hence slow improvement of the
                            Government's disaster risk reduction capacity. This risk i s
                            perceived to be moderate.

                              OPTIONTO THE REPUBLIC OF COLOMBIA

                                               I. INTRODUCTION

     1.       Natural disasters are a challenge to sustainable development in Colombia. Inthe
     past 30 years, Colombia has suffered from six major earthquakes, four volcanic eruptions,
     major landslides, and extensive flooding.' Annually Colombia suffers more than 600 natural
     disasters. Recognizing that disasters are most effectively dealt with before they happen,
     Colombia has over the past two decades institutionalized a system for comprehensive disaster
     risk management that among other things seeks to reduce vulnerability by investing in risk
     mitigation and strengthening the integration of disaster risk management in urban and
     territorial planning.

     2.       ImprovingColombia's disaster risk managementhas been a centraltheme of the
     Government's overall policy program since 2002 and has been a key pillar of the Bank's
     support strategy. In 2004, the Government requested the preparation of an Adaptable
     Program Loan (APL) series to support the implementation of its disaster risk management
     policies, particularly with regardto five priority areas. This APL series was included as part of
     the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) Progress Report discussed by the Bank Board in
     September 2005, when it extended the CAS period through the end of the Bank's 2007 fiscal
     year. The request for a Disaster Risk Management Development Policy Loan (DPL) with a
     Catastrophic Risk Deferred Drawdown Option (CAT DDO) indicates Colombia's continuing
     interest inBank support inthis policy area.

     3.       The Government has requested a replacement of the contingent component of
     APL 1with the DPL and CAT DDO because the DPL serves the development purposes
     significantly better than the existing contingent loan facility. The DPL with a CAT DDO
     provides the assurance of immediate access to Bank funds that will bridge the gap betweenthe
     occurrence of the catastrophe and the arrival of funds from other sources, such as a Bank
     Emergency Recovery Loan, bilateral aid, or revenues from new taxation. While both loans
     would disbursefunds upon the occurrence of a natural disaster resulting inthe declaration of a
     state of emergency, disbursement from the APL contingent loan facility would require the
     Governmentto submit an initial recovery planwith related budget appropriations and proposed
     use of funds document, as well as a statement of expenses from a positive list of imports. This
     would delay disbursements significantly and reduce the Government's ability to avoid
     unrecoverable economic and humanlosses inthe immediate aftermath of a catastrophic event.
     Inaddition, unlikethe contingent loan facility, the DPL with a CAT DDO is renewablefor up
     to 15 years,* providing a long-term contribution to the country's catastrophe risk financing

2. The DPL with aCAT DDO can be extendedfor four additional three-yearperiods. See thee "Memorandum to the
Executive Directors, Subject: Proposalto Enhance the IBRDDeferredDrawdown Option (DDO) andto Introduce a
DDO Option For CatastrophicRisk", January29,2008. Reportnumber 42396.

      strategy. Finally the DPL with a CAT DDO does not require the Government to continue to
      pay an annual commitment fee.

      4.      The development objective of the proposed operation is to strengthen the
      Government's program for reducing risks resulting from adverse natural events. This
      objective will be achieved by supporting for strategic areas o f action for implementation o f the
      Government's program. These action areas are to:


      0   Improve risk identification andmonitoring, and increase awareness o f risk
      0   Increase prevention and mitigation measures for risk reduction
          Strengthen National System for Disaster Management and Prevention
      0   Reduce the fiscal vulnerability o f the state to natural disasters

A. RecentEconomicDevelopments

    5.       The Colombian economy is decelerating from the rapid and accelerating
    investment led growth of recent years. The economy i s estimated to grow approximately 3.5
    percent in 2008, less than half the growth rate o f last year. In addition, inflation has risen
    slightly above 7 percent this year, driven by price shocks to foodstuffs and fuel. The expected
    current account deficit for 2008 i s 3.4 percent o f GDP, but the external accounts are
    susceptible to economic outcomes in major trading partners: namely, the United States and
    Venezuela which together purchase almost half o f Colombia's merchandise exports.          The
    current account deficit in recent years has been driven by a sharp increase in imports of both
    consumer and investment goods. In 2008, net FDI i s projected to be larger than the current
    account deficit itself.

    6.       Over the past few years, real economic growth accelerated from 2.5 percent in
    2002 to 8.2 percent in 2007, while private investment rose from 9.9 percent of GDP in
    2002 to over 16 percent in 2007. Colombia's unemployment rate dropped from over 17
    percent in 2002 to approximately 12 percent in2007, while inflation dropped from 7.0 percent
    in 2002 to 5.7 percent in 2007 (see Table 1). The positive outcome was partly due to high
    world growth, lower cost o f international credit, and the prices o f Colombia's primary exports
    have risen.       Domestic factors, particularly the improved security situation and stable
    macroeconomic polices, have also driventhe country's recovery.

    7.       The public sector deficit has been improving although fiscal concerns persist,
    particularly in terms of expenditure rigidities. With the overall macroeconomic
    environment strong over the last year, fiscal performance has been much better than expected.
    The non-financial public sector fiscal deficit decreased from 3.2 percent o f GDP in2003 to 1.O
    percent in 2007 and is expected to increase to about 1.7 percent during 2008. The central
    Government deficit was 3.2 percent o f GDP in2007, down from 3.8 percent in2006. The non-
    financial public sector deficit was much smaller than the central Government deficit because it


                                                  3

   incorporates substantial budget surpluses of the regions, state-owned enterprises, and the social
   security system.

B. MacroeconomicOutlookandDebt

   8.      The economy is deceleratingsharply in 2008. According to the most recent survey
   by National Association of Industry, total industrial production dropped 0.6 percent in the
   January-August 2008 compared to the same period in 2007. Also, total retail sales only
   increased 0.1 percent in January-August 2008, compared to the same period in 2007.
   Moreover, the first signs of the impact of the crisis are evident infinancial markets. As shown
   in Annex 2 "Potential Impact of the U.S. Financial Crisis on Colombia", interest rates have
   risen, and the spreads between Government bonds and U S Treasuries had reached almost 700
   basis points in late October. (On November 10, 2008, the Colombia Global EMBI was 498
   basis points, still substantially higher than average levels over the last two years.) Similarly,
   the exchange rate has shown signs of depreciation and a much higher volatility than
   experienced during 2007. To some extent, the depreciation has been a welcome development,
   given concerns that the appreciation of the currency during the first half of the year might be
   impacting competitiveness.

   9.      The economy is expected to slow even further in 2009. The fiscal position is
   projected to worsen, with a possible increase of the non-financial public sector deficit (to 2.5
   percent of GDP in 2009, the highest level in the last five years). The Government already
   anticipatesinternational funding (from multilateral agencies) for its external financing needs in
   the order ofUS$2.4 billionfor next year.

   10.     Colombia faces a turbulent external environment,but the Governmenthas taken
   the necessary steps to mitigateit. To reduce external risks, the Government has reducedthe
   foreign currency share of its public debt and overall external debt of both the public and
   private sector is low at about 23 percent of GDP. In addition, international reserves have
   increased substantially and now stand at over US$23 billion. The authorities have a sound
   fiscal and monetary policy inplace, with an inflationtargeting mechanism establishedand with
   a medium term fiscal framework that targets a declining public debt to GDP ratio. Overall
   external indebtedness is low (21 percent of GDP), and as noted above, the current account
   deficit has been more than fully financed by net foreign direct investment-including         during
   the first half of this year. Overall annual external financing requirements are on the order of
   US$12-15 billion, but much of this is driven by the current account deficit, with the excess of
   importsinfluencedby flows of foreign direct investment itself.

   11.     Colombia's macroeconomicpolicy framework is appropriate. Monetary policy has
   been tightened substantially since mid 2006 in response to possible overheating of economic
   growth with rate hikes totaling 4 percent since over the period. The most recent Central Bank
   boardmeeting kept interest rates on hold, despite the recent sharp deceleration of the economy.
   The authorities are awaiting further anchoring of inflationary expectations prior to considering
   a loosening o f the policy rate-an   appropriate stance in light of the inflation targeting regime.
   Public sector debt has fallen sharply as a share of GDP and a slight loosing of fiscal policy
   during 2009 is areasonable responsegiven the slowdown ineconomic growth.

12.       Financial sector indicators are favorable; however, vulnerabilities remain as
the slowdown in economic growth is likely to lead to an increase in delinquency rates for
loans. Financial sector indicators remain sound and point to relatively modest chances o f
adverse macroeconomic spillovers in the near term. While credit growth has been rapid,
credit to GDP ratios are below their peak o f the late 1990s and close to the emerging market
average. The share o f nonperforming loans has remained low, both on average and,for the
weakest performing banks. Also, inlight o f the highlevels o f provisioning, credit risk for the
banking sector as a whole remains low. Liquidity ratios have declined, although liquidity
remains sufficient to cover short-term maturity mismatches.               Market risk remains the
predominant risk to the financial system, with the Banco de la Reptiblica (Central Bank)
estimating that a 200 basis point increase in interest rates would reduce the profits o f the
bankingsystemby 20 percent. Commercial banks appear resilient, with low estimated default
probabilities. The risk of contagion from a further worsening o f problems in the subprime
market, through its effect on parent banks in developed countries, i s small. Foreign banks
account for about 20 percent o f banking sector assets, compared with an average o f over 30
percent inother large Latin American countries.

       111.      THE GOVERNMENT PROGRAMAND PARTICIPATORY PROCESSES

      13.      Disaster risk reduction is a priority for the Government of Colombia. Colombia
      has the highestrate o f recurrent natural disasters inLatinAmerica, with an average o f over 600
      reported disasters every year.3 The Government's commitment to institutionalized disaster risk
      reduction dates back to 1983 when, inthe aftermath o f the Popayan earthquake, it initiated the
      creation o f a system for disaster preparedness and response. In 1989 this system was
      consolidated with the establishment of the National System for Disaster Management and
      Prevention (Sistema Nacional para la Prevencidn y Atencidn de Desastres, SNPAD). Since
      then, the country's approach has been expanded through national-level institutional
      strengtheninginthe 1990s, the opening o fthe way for municipalities to invest inriskreduction
      measures at the start of the new century, and, most recently, the inclusion o f reduction o f fiscal
      vulnerability as a concern in the National Development Plan o f 2002-2006 and disaster risk
      management inthe National Development Plan o f 2006-201 0. Colombia i s widely recognized
      as a leader in instituting a policy and legal framework that enables a comprehensive,
      multisectoral approach to disaster risk management.

      14.      The Government of Colombia's current development strategy is laid out in the
      NationalDevelopmentPlan 2006-2010. The National Development Plan (NDP) 2006-20 10:
      Estado Comunitario: Desarrollo para Todos defines five priority development programs and
      provides guidance for monitoring results and outcomes. The NDP was formally adopted
      through Law 1151 of July 2007. In one o f these programs in the NDP, the Government
      outlines a strategy with four specific areas o f action to improve the effectiveness o f reducing
      the risk associated with adverse natural events in its territory. These action areas are (a) to
      improve risk identification and monitoring and augment awareness, (b) to increase measures
      for risk reduction (preventionand mitigation), (c) to strengthen policies and institutions o f the
     National System for Disaster Management and Prevention, and (d) to reduce the fiscal
      vulnerability o f the state to natural events. Table 3 presents the five overall programs of the
      current NDP. Areas inbold are directly or indirectly supported by this operation.

15.     The NDP is the result of a broad-based consultative process overseen by the
National Planning Council. Consultations on the NDP were carried out over two years
between September 2004 and December 2006 in 27 departments and 24 large and mid-size
cities. An estimated 21,000 people participated, representing a wide range of nonstate
organizations such as academia, religious groups, private sector, trade unions, and youth
groups.

16.     The Government's long-term vision and development strategy is laid out in the
Visi6n Colombia 2019. In anticipation of the bicentennial anniversary of Colombia's
independence, the National Planning Department (DNP) launched an initiative to develop a
longer term vision o f the country and a strategy to reach it. The process involved the
development of a proposal, Visidn Colombia II Centenario: 2019-Propuesta para Discusidn,
followed by rounds of discussions with citizens and subnational governments to refine the
vision and generate national ownership. The process culminated in the elaboration o f Visidn
Colombia 2019, a policy-planning document outlining objectives for sustainable and equitable
development. It takes into account policy areas to be addressed as the country seeks to achieve
an economy that guarantees greater levels o f well-being. These areas include (a) strengthening
actions in disaster risk prevention and mitigation, (b) reducing the fiscal vulnerability o f the
Colombian Government to natural hazards, and (c) improving decentralization and
strengthening land-use planning.All of these policy areas are supported by this Disaster Risk
Management DPL with a CAT DDO.

                     IV.BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM

     A. Linkto the CountryPartnershipStrategy

      17.     The Country Partnership Strategy for Colombia from FY08 to mid-FY11is fully
     aligned with the country's development goals, expressed in the 2006-2010 National
     Development Plan, and the longer-term development strategy Vi`isidn Colombia 2019.
      Colombia's priorities in the National Development Plan are described in Table 3 above. The
      CPS proposes to maintain an active IBRD lending program o f up to US$4 billion and an
     International Finance Corporation (IFC) program in range of US$330 million to 400 million
     per year, along with a set of analytical and advisory services and specialized grants.

      18.     The disaster risk managementframework of the proposed DPL with a CAT DDO
     falls under the Environment Sustainability pillar of the Country Partnership Strategy.
     The key objective under this pillar i s to support the Government's NDP and Millennium
     Development Goal objectives o f ensuring environmental sustainability, an area deemed o f high
     priority for Colombia's development.

      19.     In addition, this DPL with a CAT DDO will lower the risk of interruptionto the
     overall implementation of all areas of the Government's development program and the
     CPS. The DPL with a CAT DDO would provide Colombia with a rapidsource of funds inthe
     event o f a major natural disaster, enabling a quicker response to address emergency needs and
     reducing the risk o f having to halt or divert resources from the implementation o f the other
     development priorities inits NDPS4

     B. Collaborationwith the InternationalMonetaryFund

     20.      Coordination between the Bank and IMF has been strong and there have been
     frequent consultations both on macroeconomic issues and financial sector issues. The
     Bank is reviewing financial sector issues as part o f the initial phases o f preparation of a
     potential DPL that could be presented to the Board during 2009. A mission was conducted in
     late October to assess the current situation and there has been substantial dialogue with the
     IMF mission (Article IV conducted during the last week of October and first week of
     November). This work also builds on a longstanding and intensive policy dialogue by the
     Bankon financial sector development.

    C. Relationshipto Other World BankGroupOperations

     21.      The Bank has played a prominent role in financing Colombia's disaster risk
     managementand reconstructionprogramsgoing back to the late 1990s, beginning with a
     comprehensive program to address the reconstruction o f the coffee-growing region of the
     country (the Eje Cafetero), which was hit by an earthquake measuring 6.2 on the Richter scale
     in 1999. There were 1,185 deaths, about 9,000 injuries, and more than 150,000 people left


4. In response to the Eje Cafetero earthquake in 1999 four Bank loans for a total amount o f US$93 million were
restructuredto finance the start-up ofthe reconstruction program.


                                                           8

homeless. The region's housing infrastructure suffered considerable damages. In the
immediate aftermath o f the earthquake four Bank loans for a total amount o f US$93 million
were restructured to finance the start-up o f the reconstructionprogram.

22.     The Government of Colombia and the World Bank signed the Earthquake
Recovery Project (Loan 7009-CO) in May 2000. This loan provided an additional US$225
million to continue the reconstruction effort and assisted the Government in its efforts to
rebuild communities. The development objective o f the loan was "to assist the project
beneficiaries to normalize economic and social activities through the restoration o f essential
housing and basic infrastructure following adequate seismic standards." Financed components
included (a) shelter assistance, (b) rehabilitation and retrofitting o f social infrastructure, (c)
rehabilitation o f public infrastructure, (d) capacity building for natural disaster management,
(e) social capital restoration, and (f) project management. This program was at closing
evaluated by the Bank to be highly satisfactory for having achieved high quality results and its
development objectives 1year earlier than expected.

23.     The Bank's involvement in the reconstructionproject and continued technical
discussions with the Government led to the Natural Disaster Vulnerability Reduction
APL 1 signed in 2005. The project was designed to strengthen the capacity of the national
Government to coordinate disaster risk management, to build capacity at municipal level, and
to reduce disaster risk. The project, implemented through the Ministry o f Environment,
Housing, and Territorial Development (MAVDT), helps local governments carry out risk
analyses and develop risk-reduction investment plans as part o f its comprehensive strategy to
monitor and support disaster risk reduction. Additionally, with support from the project, the
Government i s establishing a comprehensive strategy o f risk retentionand risk financing at the
national level. A little more than two years into implementation, the APL 1 has produced
results. To date, the project has supported considerable advances inthe policy area (new policy
documents, legal and institutional proposals, and so forth), and provided support for
municipalities to develop Action Plans that take into account disaster risk. According to
preliminary information, local investment in disaster risk management has since inception o f
the programincreased by 72 percent.

24.     Through the APL 1operation, and prior to the BankBoard approval of the DPL
with a CAT DDO instrument,the APL piloted an innovativecontingent loan facility to
provide faster availability of resources in case of national emergency. Designed with an
investment instrument, the disbursement from the contingent loan facility would require the
Government to submit an initial recovery planwith related budgetappropriations and proposed
use o f funds as well as a statement o f expenses from a positive list o f certified imports. This
contingent loan facility has not been disbursed to date, because there has been no declaration
o f national disaster since effectiveness o f the loan. However, simulations held during project
implementation to practice disbursement procedures and to analyze the time needed indicate
that it will take from two to four weeks for the Government to have access to the money from
the time ofthe declaration ofemergency. The DPL with a CAT DDOis designed to disburse in
24-48 hours.

25.     In 2006, the Government and the Bank signed the NaturalDisasterVulnerability
ReductionAPL 2. This operation, a sub national loanto the District of Bogota, aims to reduce


                                               9

      Bogota's exposure to human and economic losses in case o f natural disaster through the
      implementation o f risk reduction activities and through the development o f a risk-financing
      strategy. With the support o f this loan, Bogota has made substantial progress in the
      implementation o f a strong disaster risk management framework and development o f a
      complete analysis o f the city's exposure and vulnerability. The district has undertaken a large
      investment program aimed at improving the resilience o f priority structures, including schools,
      hospitals, and kindergartens, to adverse natural events and, under the project's resettlement
      framework, i s in the process o f resettling families from areas o f the city where disaster risk
      cannot be mitigated to safer and better housing facilities. The district's Secretariat o f Finance i s
      leading the strategy to reduce the fiscal vulnerability o f Bogota inthe event o f a disaster. Less
      than two years into implementation, this project has already surpassed its development
      objective o f reducing the number o f people at risk due to public buildings that do not meet
      minimumstandards from 575,000 to 475,000.

      26.      In addition, Colombia is              expected to request Bank support to join the
      Comprehensive Approach to Probabilistic Risk Assessment (CAPRA) initiative. CAPRA
      has been piloted in Costa Rica and Nicaragua and i s currently expanding to cover four
      additional Central American countries. CAPRA efforts inColombia will be developed by DNP
      and the National Directorate o f Disaster Prevention and Management (DPAD) in coordination
      with scientific and technical agencies. CAPRA is a knowledge platform which seeks to
      promote better decision making related to disaster risk management, covering the following
      areas: (a) identification o f risk; (b) risk reduction, to conduct cost-benefit analysis o f
      investment and to generate landplanning tools, (c) the management o f disasters inthe stages o f
      response, rehabilitation, andrecovery; and (d) financial protection.

      27.      The Bank has experiencewith various instruments to accelerate the availability of
      resources after major disasters: (a) the Organization o f Eastern Caribbean States Emergency
      Recovery and Disaster Management Adaptable Program Loan, launched in December 1998,
     was organized as a horizontal APL with a floating phase available in case o f emergency; and
      (b) the Caribbean Catastrophe RiskInsurance Facility, launched inJanuary 2007, has provento
     be an efficient use o f parametric insurance instruments to provide immediate liquidity to
      countries affected by adverse natural events. None o f these is as flexible and fast disbursing as
     the DPL with a CAT DDO.

     D.Lessons Learned

     28.       The risk of disasters can be managed rather than treating a disaster as an
     exogenous shock to development that cannot be proactively addressed. This has been
     documented in a wide array o f studies and is the underpinning o f the Hyo o Framework for
     Action,     the international agreement adopted by 168 governments!                               Colombia has
     acknowledged that hazard risk i s a manifestation o f development that i s not adequately adapted
     to the environment and that managing disaster risk i s good practice in sustainable

5. The Hyogo Framework for Action (HFA) was formulated as a comprehensive, action-oriented response to
international concern about the growing impacts o f disasters on individuals, communities, and national development.
Based on careful study o f trends indisaster risks and on practical experience indisaster risk reduction, and subjected to
intensive negotiations during 2004 and early 2005, the HFA was finally adopted by 168 governments at the World
Conference on Disaster Reduction, heldinKobe, Hyogo Prefecture, Japan, 18-22 January 2005.

     development. It has consequently included disaster risk management in its national
     developmentprogram and long-term developmentvision.

     29.       The design of this Disaster Risk Management DPL with a CAT DDO takes into
     account the lessons learned from 25 years of Bank operations and programs in the area
     of disaster risk management and 25 years of Colombia's experience with disaster risk
     management. The IndependentEvaluation Group (IEG) report, "Hazards of Nature, Risks to
     Development: An Evaluation of World Bank Assistance for Natural DisastersyYy6recommends
     that the Bank assist its clients most vulnerable to natural disasters to shift from focusing
     entirely on disaster response to implementing programs and policies for comprehensively
     managing disaster risk. This is inconsonancewith the conclusions reachedby the Government
     of Colombia to effectively integrate disaster risk management into its development planning.
     The design of this operation reflects the most important lessons from the more than 500 Bank
     projects evaluated by IEGand from more than 600 annual disasters inColombia. These are the
     following:


           0      Disaster risk management is most efficient when based on adequate risk
           identification. Risk identification i s one of the four strategic areas of action for disaster
           risk management in Colombia's National Development Plan. Through scientific agencies
           such as the Institute for Hydrological, Meteorological, and Environmental Studies
           (Instituto de Hidrologia, Meteorologia y Estudios Ambientales, IDEAM), IGAC, and the
           Colombian Institute for Mining and Geology (Instituto Colombiano de Mineriu y
           Geologiu, INGEOMINAS), Colombia has developed detailed hazard maps and hazard-
           monitoring systems covering the entire territory. The country is currently working with
           support from the Bank on integrating available technical information for improved
           functionality for policy makers.


           0      Ex ante investments should be undertaken in the area of disaster risk
           management. Colombia has made significant investmentsinmitigating disaster risk, both
           by resettling people living in high-risk areas and by investing in retrofitting critical
           infrastructure such as roads, bridges, hospitals, and school^.^ The NDP and the Visidn
           Colombia 2019 outline ambitious targets in terms of reducing the vulnerability of
           infrastructure to adverse natural events such as earthquakes.


           0      There is great value in having a prior risk financing strategy. It is essential for
           faster recovery after a disaster event that a country is prepared for the challenge of
          financing the recovery and reconstruction process. When this i s not done, global
          experience shows that the result is often expensive debt instruments, diversion ofresources
          from ongoing development programs, or slow and insufficient reconstruction financing.
          Addressing this issue is one of the mainpurposes of the DPL with a CAT DDO. Colombia
          has access to reconstruction financing through a variety of sources. The proposed

    operation will serve as bridge financing, thus providing liquidity inthe first period after a
    national disaster untilrecovery financing from other sources becomes available.

          I t i s critical to secure a flexible source of funding to cover early recoveryin case
    of a natural disaster. Colombia as well as other countries have experienced that the
    immediate availability of liquidity is essential for a government to reestablish critical
    services as fast as possible inthe aftermath of a disaster event. Ifa government has access
    to untiedliquidity this will accelerate recovery and minimize business interruption as well
    as secure the functioning of critical public facilities such as those for health services. On
    average 50 percent of the economic losses associated large natural disasters occur in the
    period after the event untilthe economy has recoveredits normal functionality.

32.     These documents have all contributedto maketangiblethe economic, human,and
financialriskassociatedwith adversenaturalevents andthereby sensitized policy makers
as well as the general public to be more proactive in managingdisaster risk. The studies
provide detailed actionable information, thus making rational the investment in risk
identification andreduction, the improvement of development planning as well as the use of ex
ante risk- financing instruments and make the argument that securing funds ex ante i s essential
for a cost-effective governmentrisk-financing strategy.

33.     Other analyses that have informed the preparation of the economic,
environmental, and social elements of the operation and helped guide the Government's
policydirectionin its disaster risk managementprogramincludethe policy notes prepared
by the World Bank for the current administration (Colombia 2006-2010: A Window of
Opportunity) and other economic and sector work, in particular the Country Environmental
Analysis (CEA). Cornerstones of the CEA include (a) an assessment of the cost of
environmental degradationinColombia, (b) a broad assessment of the institutional capacity for
environmental management in Colombia, and (c) an assessment of the effectiveness and
efficiency of existing policy, legislative, and regulatory frameworks to address environmental
concerns. The analysis of the cost of environmental degradation conducted as part of the CEA
shows that the most costly problems associated with environmental degradation are urban air
pollution, inadequate water supply, sanitation and hygiene, natural disasters (such as flooding
and landslides), land degradation, and indoor air pollution. The burdenof these costs falls most
heavily on vulnerable segments of the population, especially poor children under the age o f
five. The effects of environmental degradation associated with these principal causes are
estimated to cost more than 3.7 percent of GDP, mainly due to increased mortality and
morbidityand decreased productivity.

      36.      The principal action taken by Colombia under the program to improve its
      capacity to manage risk resulting from adverse natural events is the inclusion of a
      strategyfor (i) disasterrisk reductionand (ii) disasterriskmanagement,as a specificand
      prominent element in Colombia's 2006-2010 National DevelopmentPlan. The National
      Development Plan was enacted into law through Law 1151 of July 2007. Elevating
      disaster risk management to a national development priority embodied in law approved by
      parliament constitutes a very significant policy action. InColombia, the National Development
      Plan i s made into law by Congress and it includes budgetary appropriations and specifies
      institutional responsibilities as well as target indicators and reporting and monitoring
      mechanisms. The Colombian constitution mandates that national development plans should
      articulate economic, social and environmental dimensions in order to guarantee sustainable
      development. Inorder to comply with this mandate, and following similar principles as Vision
      2019, the NDP 2006-2010 establishes disaster risk management and environmental
      management as baseline conditions for sustainable development. Chapter 5 o f the NDP
      presents and describes the areas o f actions for disaster risk management: (i)               to identify and

   37.       The prior action agreed with the Government is consistent with the five good
   practice principles on conditionality as identified by the Bank's 2005 review and its
   updates. Information inBox 1describes how this disaster risk management DPL with a CAT
   DDOis alignedwith each ofthese principles.

               Box 1: Operational Consistencywith Bank Good Practices Principles on Conditionality

Principle 1: Reinforce ownership

  Alignment with Government goals: This operation is driven by the Government of Colombia and enjoys solid
  ownership in the country. The disaster risk management DPL with a CAT DDO is supporting the Government's
  National Development Strategy and is aligned with its Visidn Colombia 2019. This operation recognizesthe priority
  givento disasterrisk management by the Governmentof Colombia.
  Positive track record of reform by the Government: The Government has strong policy planningand implementation
  capabilities and has shown stable commitmentto the program and its objectives since 2002. This is the third operation
  with Bank involvement focusing on disaster risk management. The two existing APLs are on their way to meet or
  exceed expectedoutcomes.
  Timely and demand-driven analytical support: The operation is underpinnedby knowledge services under the APL
  series for risk financing and disaster risk reductionto the Government, which were requestedby the Government and
  have servedas inputs for relevantpolicy designand implementation.

Principle 2: Agree up front with the Government and other financial partners on a coordinated accountability
framework

The proposedloanis basedon a coherent framework of previous actions and expectedoutcomes that are drawn fromthe
Government's program.
  Jointly designedpolicy matrix. The Government and the Bank have prepared an operational policy matrix, agreeing
  on prior actions for Board approval and expected program outcomes based on the Government's National
  DevelopmentPlan2006-20 10.

Principle 3: Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to country circumstances

The loan features follow the client's requests andthe policy matrixhas beenadaptedto country circumstances.
  Adaptation ofBank services to a sophisticated MIC. Through the two APLs and with this disaster risk management
  DPL with a CAT DDO, the Bankhas offereddifferent products tailoredto the needs of the Government. Knowledge
  services have informed policy making and supported the implementation of the Government's disaster risk
  management program. The close ties to the Government's own Development Plan assures the Government's full
  ownership of the reform agenda supportedby the operation. Finally, loan features have been tailored to client needs,
  includinga short preparationperiod, a more flexible instrument allowing faster disbursement and availability of funds
  for disbursement for up to 15 years.
  Thepolicy matrix is based on the Government'sprogram. The accountabilityframework is filly consistent with the
  Government's program, and specific actions and outcomes are drawn entirely from its program. This operation does
  not supportpolitically sensitive reforms.

Principle 4: Choose only actions critical for achieving results as conditionsfor disbursement

  As indicated, funds may be drawn down upon occurrence of a natural disaster resultingin a declaration of a national
  level disaster of the president of Colombiathrough an executive decree, in accordancewith Law Decree No. 919 of
 May 1989.

Principle 5: Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-based financial
support

 The policy matrix contains outcomes that have been defined by the borrower and are closely linked to the supported
 policy actions. This will helpthe Bankand Governmentreviewprogressduringproject implementation.

     B.PolicyArea andPriorAction

     Policy Area: Evolution of Disaster Risk Management Policy in Colombia

      38.     Natural hazards are a challengeto sustainable development in Colombia. The risk
      o f natural disasters can be expressed as the probability o f a natural hazard affecting a
      vulnerable community. In the past 30 years, Colombia has suffered from six major
      earthquakes, four volcanic eruptions, annual major landslides, and extensive flooding.'
      According to the Global Hotspots Analysis, 85 percent o f its population and 87 percent o f its
      assets are located in areas exposed to two or more natural hazards." Colombia's urban
      population grows by an average o f 3 percent a year, makingit one o f the fastest-growing urban
      populations inthe world." The increasing concentration o f people and assets in areas exposed
      to natural hazards results ina rising disaster risk if there are no mitigations.

      39.     Colombia has 25 years of experience in institutionalizing the management of
      disaster risk. Following the devastating Popayan earthquake o f 1983, the Colombian
      Government established the National System for Disaster Management and Prevention
      (SNPAD),       articulated around a National Disaster Prevention and Attention Plan (Plan
      Nacional para la Prevencidn y Atencidn de Desastres, PNPAD). The SNPAD consolidated
      previous Government commissions and introduced consistent instruments to seek coordination
      among all actors, with particular emphasis on preparing for disaster-related emergencies.

      40.     Since the mid-l990s, Colombia has moved from disaster response to disaster risk
      management. In 1998, the Colombian Government ratified a new version o f the National Plan
      for Disaster Prevention and Response (Decree #93 o f January 13) which shifted the focus o f
      disaster management from emergency response to disaster prevention,                              through a
      comprehensive disaster risk management strategy, based on four lines o f action: (i)                       risk
      identification, (ii) reduction, (iii)
                            risk                     institutional development, and (iv) risk awareness.I2 At
      the same time CONPES (National Council o f Social and Economic Policy) 3146 o f 1998
      raised the issue o f the fiscal vulnerability o f the state to natural disasters for the first time,
      identifying concerns for the financing o f reconstruction should a major catastrophic event
      occur inColombia.

      41.     Since the early 2000s, Colombia has decentralized disaster risk management
      responsibilities and made disaster risk management a national development priority. In
      2001, recognizing the high cost that disasters extract from local authorities and the need to
      encourage investment in disaster mitigation, the national Government created an investment

     national revenue-sharing system. According to Law 715/2001, Articles 76.5, 76.9, and 79,
     municipalities can now elect to spend budgetary transfers on disaster prevention and response.
     At the close of the Pastrana administration, a National Policy Statement14(CONPES, 3146 of
     December, 2001) followed up on the earlier decree, raising disaster vulnerability reduction to
     the level o f national development priority for the first time, and stipulating its inclusion inthe
     NDP.

     42.       Colombia is currently implementing a four pillar strategy for disaster risk
     managementspecifically defined by the NationalDevelopment Plan. Under the presidency
     o f Alvaro Uribe the Government has integrated disaster risk management into its development
     plans through the inclusion of fiscal vulnerability and disaster risk management inthe NDP o f
     2002-2006 and disaster risk management in the NDP of 2006-2010.'5 Chapter 5 o f the NDP
     2006-2010 presents and describes the areas o f actions for disaster risk management: (i)to
     identify andmonitor risk and to disseminate its knowledge, (ii) reduce and prevent risk, (iii)
                                                                                 to
     to develop policies and strengthen institutions, and (iv) to reduce fiscal vulnerability usingrisk
     transfer instruments.

    First Area of Action under the NDP: Improving Risk IdentiJcation and Monitoring and Increasing
    awareness

     43.       Riskidentification is a key step indisaster riskmanagementand the starting point
     in any risk-reduction activity. A careful conceptual approach ensures the correct
     identification and communication o f risks a community faces.16 The process of risk
     identification must be guidedby the decisions it seeks to inform. Thus, data gatheredshouldbe
     transformed into information about expected loss or risk and analyzed to provide knowledge o f
     the sources o f loss and options for users to manage risk. This transformation process has data
     as the key challenge: its availability, acquisition, harmonization, and analysis. Meeting this
     challenge can involve extensive coordination o f disparate data sources or institutions that
     generate basic data with those who serve as repositories and administrators of data in order to
     analyze and communicate risk to decision makers.

     44.       In the past three years, Colombia has strengthened information collection and
     analytic capacity for early warning and risk mapping related to hydrological, seismic and
     volcanic events. With national budget and support from the APL 1, INGEOMINAS and
     IDEAMhave purchased and installed equipment to update existing systems for monitoring
     catastrophic events. The three regional volcanic observatories and the national earthquake

15. Annex 15 shows Colombia's performance on an index designed to assess disaster risk management.
16. This process requires multidisciplinary inputs-technicaUscientific disciplines work together to assess hazards and
model their effects, which must then be combined with vulnerability of elements exposed-     itself derived from both
physical and socioeconomic analysis of structures, economies, and cultural practices. A complete risk profile can
therefore be understood as the description of the damage or loss a community can expect from prevalent hazards
expressedinprobabilities of given loss or through maps for chosen scenarios.

monitoring network as well as seismic and strong motion networks managed by
INGEOMINAS are fully operational and provide real-time information and early warnings
also available via the Internet. IDEAM has recently modernized the hydro meteorological
monitoring network, installing close to 500 new automatic stations, which, added to the 2,500
existing conventional stations, make Colombia probably the most densely monitored country
in Latin America. The new stations provide real-time information on river levels and rainfall
through satellite communication usedwith daily satellite imagery to provide early warnings on
flooding, forest fires, and land slides. Both agencies will over the next three years continue to
update and expandtheir monitoring capacity.

45.     In the past five years, Colombia has improved and organized information and
information flows for disaster vulnerability, risk evaluation, and risk reduction
programs.At a national scale, hazard maps for the main river basins and for Galeras volcano
have been updated. At the local level, earthquake risk maps have beenproduced for more than
15 cities (including Bogota, Medellin, Cali, and Manizales). Urban landslide and flooding
maps have been produced for Bogota, Medellin, Manizales and Bucaramanga. This
information i s publicly available and has beenused for prioritizing investing inrisk reduction,
such as relocating communities and retrofitting hospitals in Bogota, conducting land planning
and urbanslope stabilization inManizales, and protecting urban streams inMedellin.

46.     Colombia has worked to build a culture of risk reductionthrough integrationof
disaster risk management in education and research. DPAD has worked with Colciencia
and the National System o f Science and Technology (Sistema Nacional de Ciencia y
Tecnologia, SNCyT) to develop a strategy to strengthen science and technology for disaster
riskmanagement. The strategy was adopted in2002. DPAD has also worked with the Ministry
o f Education to include risk management into environmental education.

47.     Currently, DPAD is          working on establishing an Integrated Geographic
InformationSystem for Disaster Preventionand Management. The system will provide a
platform for the agencies to make up the National System for Disaster Management and
Prevention to manage and to share information which will help other entities develop
knowledge o f vulnerability and risk, including scientific and technical data, geographic
information and mapping programs, and reports on mitigation programs and actions-in
particular, best practices from local entities.

48.     DNP is working with the Bank on a proposal to expand the CAPRA system to
cover Colombia. This would help facilitate a comprehensive understandingo f risk and risk
management. CAPRA provides a broad set o f sectors with a baseline catalogue o f data
required for risk evaluations as well reference methodology and interactive software tools to
support risk identification and applications for risk analysis. This will help establish standards
for sharing data and a common language for understanding risk. The applications CAPRA
supports are adjusted to the needs o f each sector and user, such as emergency response, land
use planning, investment works in mitigation, or financial protection strategies. The
transparent nature o f the models and open architecture o f the CAPRA system ensures that
future users can understand, adjust, and continue to evolve their tools as their needs change.

        49.      In spite of the important advances in data gathering and knowledge production
        and some advances in awareness raising, Colombia still has significant challenges. The
        immediate priority in regard to data collection and knowledge production i s to expand
        geographical coverage and scientific depth. The main challenge, however, lies in knowledge
        creation among decision makers and citizens at local levels. Successful implementation o f the
        DRISand CAPRA will helpaddressthis challenge.

       SecondArea of Action under the NDP: Increase Mitigation and Prevention Measuresfor Risk
       Reduction

        50.      When sufficient data exist to quantify the disaster risk, decision makerscan make
        informed decisions to invest efficiently in risk reduction. These investments can involve
        both structural mitigation works, such as seismic retrofitting, and nonstructural investments,
        such as relocating people from high-riskareas. Most often these decisions should be made at a
        decentralized level, as close as possible to the assets and people at risk. Given that a country
        like Colombia has such a highexposure to natural hazards, the challenge becomes politically to
        definethe acceptable level of risk andto finance the mitigation o fthe unacceptable risk.

        51.      Colombia has largely decentralized the legal responsibility for disaster risk
        reduction to the municipalities. l7The municipalities rely on three main instruments to
        mainstream disaster risk reduction in development strategies. These are the municipal
        development plans, the land-useplans, and the environmental management plans. The national
        Government i s currently implementing programs to provide technical assistance to
        municipalities to improve the integration o f disaster risk management into their land-use plans
        which inturn will inform the municipal development plans." Given the relatively highquality
        of its risk identification, the basic conditions then exist for municipalities to make significant
        and efficient investmentsindisaster riskreduction.

        52.     Investments in disaster risk management including risk reduction are done at
        three levels in Colombia;by the national Government, by departmental governments, and by
        municipal governments. Since the legal responsibility to invest in risk reduction i s
        decentralized, it i s not surprisingthat municipalities invest a larger share o f their total disaster
        risk management budgets inpreventive work than does the national Government. Pie charts 1,
        2, and 3 show the distribution o f the investments in accordance with the strategies laid out in
        PNPAD.19


 17. Law 9189, Law 291, Law 152194, Law 388197, Law 902104, and Decree 4002104 regulate the municipalities'
 responsibilities with respect to disaster risk management. Law 715101 offers municipalities the opportunity to use
 untied transfers to invest in disaster mitigation. Disaster response i s organized at four levels. Local communities are
 first responders, but ifan event is of such a scale that they cannot cope on their own, first Municipalities, then Province
 andthenthe Statetakes over the responseresponsibility.

entities are increasing. Table 6 shows the total investment by municipalities in disaster risk
management from 2004 to 2006.

54.        In addition to investments by the three levels of core public administration,
infrastructure agencies also invest significantly in risk reduction. INVIAS is responsible
for risk-mitigationwork related to roads, ports, and riverine infrastructure. Through the APL 1
project alone, INVIAS invested more than US$40 million in risk-mitigation works in 2007.
The Colombian Oil Company (ECOPETROL) i s seeking to retrofit all its critical installations

      to become seismic resistant.20The Bank has been following progress and quality closely due to
      its involvement through the APL 1. ECOPETROL expects to finalize this program o f
      investments in2009.

      55.      Most of the investmentsin risk reductionat municipallevelare done by a handful
      of the larger municipalentities, reflectingthat muchwork still needs to be done in terms
      of buildingawareness and capacitiesamonglocal governments.One indicator of the status
      i s that only 20 percent o f municipalities reporting floods in the period from 2004 to 2006 have
      investedinrisk-reduction measures for flood protection inthe same period. Both MAVDT and
      DPAD have active programs in building capacity and awareness among municipalities for
      disaster risk reduction which the Bank i s supporting. These programs will over the next three
      years expand coverage to up to 40 percent o f municipalities in the country and thereby form
      the basis for more widespread and more effective investments in risk reduction at municipal
      level. In addition the DNP will continue to monitor municipal investments in risk reduction to
      track ifthe capacity building efforts has any impact on municipal decision makingwith regards
      to risk reduction.

     ThirdArea of Action under the NDP: StrengtheningPolicies andInstitutions of the National
     Systemfor Disaster Management andPrevention

      56.      The main institutionalchallengein managingdisaster risk is to integrate a system
      that linksthe locallevelwith the nationallevel, on the one hand, and operations/executive
      functions with analyticalhformation-generating functions, on the other. These links are
      critical both for efficient vulnerability reduction and for efficient disaster response. The result
      ought to be a cohesive system o f clearly designated responsibilities and shared information.
      This will ensure that the comprehensive disaster risk management approach chosen by the
      Government i s carried out effectively. The results will necessarily always depend on the
      capacity o f the various links inthe system.

      57.      Colombia has built a National System for Disaster Managementand Prevention,
      articulated around a NationalDisasterPreventionand Attention Plan.The systemhas its
      mandate in Law 46 from 1988 and includes both public and private agencies with
      responsibilities for risk mitigation and prevention as well as emergency response and
      rehabilitation. The system i s coordinated by the Directorate o f Disaster Prevention and
      Attention presided over by the Minister o f Interior and Justice. Furthermore, the systemhas an
      operative arm coordinated by a National Operative Committee and a technical/scientific arm
      coordinated by the National Technical Committee. Vertically, the system has regional
      committees presided over by the provincial governors and local committees presided by
      mayors.21

      58.      Colombia, through its NationalSystem for Disaster Managementand Prevention,
      has been a leader in instituting a policy and legal framework that enables a
      comprehensive, multisectoral approach to disaster risk management. The role o f

existing key public buildings must be retrofitted or rebuilt to be earthquake resistant(Law 400 of 1997).

     Colombian experts and those graduate-level trainees in disaster risk management in the
     country has been important in this shift and its consolidation.22 The country i s a leader in such
     risk-reduction approaches and measures as the introduction of building codes and enforcement,
     municipal programs, and the integration o f science and technology with public policy making.


                        Box 2: Colombia's Capacity to Respondto NaturalDisasters

      It is hard to measure a country's preparedness and response capacity prior to seeing it in action. Experience
      shows, however, that if a country is blind-sided by a large event, the effectiveness o f its reaction is limited even
      ina country with highcapacity. Hence, adequate knowledge o fpotential risks to natural disasters is intimately
      linked to the efficiency o f a disaster response system. Countries can further improve their capacities for disaster
      response by training and practicing emergency response, clarifying command procedures for emergency
      situations, as well as planning for inter-institutional communication and coordination inemergency situations.

      In Colombia, the government has been buildinga national system for disaster prevention and response since
      1983. The disaster response structure has four levels o f organization. Response to a given natural event starts
      with the local level determining ifthe event is o f a magnitude that the local response committee can handle or
      ifhelpneedberequestedatthe Municipal, DepartmentalorNationallevel.

      The National Directorate o f Disaster Prevention and Response since 2006 has been providing training at local,
      municipal, and departmental levels through the Local, Municipal and Departmental Committees for Disaster
      Prevention and Response. A new plan for training municipalities was approved in 2007 and is under
      implementation with support o fthe A P L 1. In2008, 60 municipalities will be trained, and 150 in2009.

      T o test existing capacity simulations and drills have been carried out in major cities. The latest and largest
      exercise was a earthquake simulation, in Bogota. First responders, national and district authorities, and the
      general population all participated inthe exercise as part o f the mass prevention,campaign "with the feet on the
      ground" (www,conlospiesenlatirra.gov.co).

      Another way to assess the response capacity in Colombia is to look at the number o f people that have been
      affected by natural disasters and attended to by the SNPAD. Between 1999 and 2008, the System (Local
      Committees, Regional Committees and the National Committee) attended more than 75% o f the people that
      requested humanitarianhelp due to natural disasters received support.

      The response capacity o f all levels inthe system activated at the same time has only been tested once since its
      creation; this was in 1999 after the Armenia earthquake, which caused thousands o f deaths and a high level o f
      structural damage. Immediately after the earthquake the Government o f Colombia established the
      Reconstruction Fundfor the Coffee Region (FOREC). FOREC reported to the Office o f the President with the
      National Planning Department (DNP) acting as secretariat. FOREC was to finance, execute and coordinate the
      economic, social and environmental reconstruction o f the disaster-affected region. The operation's outcome
      was subsequently evaluated to be highly satisfactory due to its speed and quality. Judging from the response
      and reconstruction after the Armenia earthquake, Colombia has a well functioning response system.

      Colombia i s clearly better prepared for a disaster now than it was 20 years ago; firstly, they have stronger
      institutions and disaster response organization, at national, departmental, municipal and local levels; secondly,
      municipalities and major cities know their risks better; thirdly, important vulnerability reduction measures are
      being implemented. Colombia's effort to reduce vulnerability to diminish the effects o f disasters in a
      comprehensive way is a great example for the region and the world, however, there is a significant additional
      need to improve comprehensive disaster risk management, particularly at the local and municipal level.

     59.      The challenge for Colombia is to resist pressures to fall back into an emergency
     focus. To resist these pressures implies the need to upgrade, integrate, and further consolidate
     the National System for Disaster Management and Prevention. Responsibilities for disaster
     vulnerability reduction continue to be fragmented, and capacities to comply with mandates in
     some cases remain insufficient. The DPAD, now operating under the Ministry o f the Interior
     and Justice, is charged with organizing, training, and preparing local governments for disaster
     management. Regional and local development planningand investments, however, are guided
     by the MAVDT, which also regulates environmentalissues, many o f which are key for disaster
     riskanalysis andplanning. Technical knowledge andforecasting are dealt with by a variety of
     agencies, some under the auspices of MAVDT, such as IDEAM,the weather and hydrological
     information system, but others are independent-INGEOMINAS , for example, which
     monitors and evaluates geological hazards, i s under the aegis of the Ministry o f Mines and
     Energy. Finally, fiscal contingencies and issues related to risk financing are within the
     mandate o f the Ministry o f Finance (Ministerio de Hacienda y CrCdito Publico, MHCP).
     Though good work i s being done inall these institutions, technical capacity i s a limitingfactor
     inseveral, particularly at local levels, and institutionalcoordination remains a challenge.23The
     Government will continue to address these challenges over the next three years. Inthis period
     the DPAD in coordination with DNP and MAVDT will be working towards a stronger
     framework for coordination among the various institutions inthe SNPAD.

    FourthArea of Action under the NDP: Reducing the Fiscal Vulnerability of the State to Natural
    Disasters

     60.      The main challenge for the Government with regard to reducing the fiscal
     vulnerability of the state to natural disasters is to finance and rapidly initiate the
     recovery phase in the aftermath of a natural disaster. A risk-financing strategy should
     differentiate    between a range o f higher frequency/lower                          cost events and lower
     frequency/higher cost events. Lower layers o f risk (higher-frequency/lower-cost events) can
     generally be financed through retention, such as reserves, special budget appropriations, and
     budget reallocations. These sources of funds are rarely sufficient to cover large losses for
     which other risk-financing instruments are generally needed.

     61.     The DPL with a CAT DDO has been designed to provide a financing bridge-
     after a disaster of a scale that cannot be funded with the internal reserve-to                            other
     sources of relief as they become available. As part o f a catastrophe risk-financing strategy,
     this instrument will provide the Government bridge financing in response to adverse natural
     events generating losses beyond the capacity o f the annual budget allocation to DPAD for
     responding to disasters. The MHCP estimates that after a national disaster it would need three
     to six months to be able to raise alternative financing to carry out recovery needs. The US$150
     million available in this DPL would avoid a bottleneck in the early recovery and help start
     reconstruction activities immediately.

     62.     CONPES 3146 of 1998 raised the issue of the fiscal vulnerability of the state to
     natural disasters and identified concerns for the financing of reconstruction should a

     major catastrophic event occur. Cardona et al. (2005)24 estimate that the Government of
     Colombia would face a long-term resource gap, that is, a shortfall o f funding available
     compared to fundingneeds, ifconfrontedwith a disaster with a returnperiod o f 100years.25

     63.      The Government has a dual-risk financing strategy. First it is seeking to encourage
     the use of insurance inthe private sector so as to reduce its contingent exposure. Inaddition,
     the Government is seeking to reduce its own exposure by insuring public assets, securing
     contingent lines o f credits, and investinginrisk reduction.

     64.      The Government is working on a series of policy documents related to the
     retention and transfer of the residual riskinColombia. InColombia all public buildings are
     required by law to be insured (Law No. 42 de 1993).The MHCP is currently investigating
     options to design a cost-effective insurance program for public assets and a catastrophe
     insurance program for private dwellings. The MHCP has conducted a series o f technical
     studies on earthquake risk assessment to evaluate the physical damage caused by a major
     earthquake on public assets. This complements other studies carried out by the District o f
     Bogota on the impact o f earthquakes on public buildings and private dwellings. These studies,
     based on state-of-the art catastrophe risk-modeling techniques, provide the Government o f
     Colombia very detailed informationon earthquake risk assessment.26

     65.      Several municipalities have advanced work on their own risk financing strategies.
     These include the following:


        0    Manizales2' has implemented a voluntary collective private insurancestrategy. The
             premium, which covers earthquakes and other natural events, is paid through the
             dwelling tax. There is a subsidy for the most vulnerable population (strata 1 and 2); the
             amount o fthe subsidy is function o fthe insuredvalue o fprivate property.


        0    Sabaneta2*has implemented an obligatory collective private insurance policy, which
             covers all the private dwellings o f the municipality (7,800). To have access to the policy,
             which covers earthquake and other natural events, it i s required that the property tax has
             beenpaid.


        0    Bogoti has advanced work on a disaster risk-financing strategy. With support from
             the APL 2, the Secretariat of Finance has carried out earthquake assessment for each of

       the buildings in its cadastral database. Currently Bogota is developing a financial
       strategy for covering its public assets and for promoting the insurance of private
       dwellings.

66.     While progress has been made to institutionalize disaster risk management in
general, work remainsfor Colombiato institutionalizeits disaster risk financing.A main
challenge relatesto the risk to private housing. Legally this is private risk, but inthe event of a
major disaster, the Government is likely to be called upon as the insurer of last resort. A
solution is being sought that involves collaboration between the national Government and the
most important municipalities, as well as public-private partnershipsinvolvingthe national and
international insurance markets. With facilitation from the Bank MHCP, the Secretary o f
Finance of the District of Bogota as well as the insurance association will over the next three
years be working towards launching an insurance scheme to protect both private and public
assets from natural disasters.

                                   VI. OPERATIONIMPLEMENTATION

      A. Povertyand Social Impact

      67.      This operationis expected to havesignificantpositiveimpactsfor the poor.

      68.      Natural disasters have a disproportionateimpact on the poor.Ninety-nine percent
      o f people affected by the close to 6,000 large scale natural disasters worldwide registered
      between 1970 and 2002 were people in developing c~untries.~'           In Colombia in the last three
      decades close to 10,000 people have died and more than 14 million people have been affected
      just from recurrent small scale disasters like flooding and landslides. More than 1 million
      people were affected by various flood events in 2007. The vast majority o f these people are
      from the lowest income quintiles.

      69.      Poor populations are less resilient than others to exogenous shocks and when
      shocks occur the poor tend to suffer larger damages relative to their livelihoods. This
      statement i s true for natural disasters as well as other shocks. This is because the poorer
      segments o f the population often live inthe most vulnerable locations and live in inadequately
      constructed housing.30Inaddition, the poor have limited labor skills, fewer assets, and little or
      no savings. They have little opportunity for risk diversification and restricted access to credit.
      Because o f this, they are less able to cushion the impact on consumption o f disruptions to
      income. Exogenous shocks can also increase poverty indirectly through the effects o f lower
      economic growth, higher inflation (the poor are more vulnerable to inflation), and through
      consequential lower Government spending for social services.31

      70.      The implementationof the Disaster Risk ManagementDPL with a CAT DDO in
      Colombia is expected to have a positivedirect impact on poverty and other social issues.
      InBogota alone the Government's investment instrengthening public schools, most ofthem in
      the poorest areas of Bogota, since 2006 has created a safer education environment for about
      200,000 students and teachers. In addition to strengthening the buildings to reduce the risk o f
      collapse in an earthquake the investment has also improved the school environment making it
      more green, more environment friendly, with better light and safer. Another example is
      investments to reduce the risk of interruptions o f infrastructure and public utilities service
      networks due to adverse natural events. With technical support from the MAVDT under the
      Government's National Development Plan, private and public utilities are integrating disaster
      riskmanagement intheir investment plans.

      71.      The operation will also have an indirect positive impact for the poor. Since the
      project directly supports one of the pillars in the national development plan, and since the

disaster risk management DPL with a CAT DDO reduces the risk o f interruption and diversion
o f resources from the other pillars of the national development plan, the prior action taken by
the Government is expected to have indirect positive poverty and social impacts.

72.     Significantstakeholderconsultationhasbeencarriedout andis ongoingunderthe
APLl Component B1. These consultations consist of meetings and training sessions with
Municipalities to understand why some invest invulnerability reduction and others do not, and
with communities to understand why some communities are better prepared for emergency
response than others. This information i s being captured by the DNP, the DPAD and the
MAVDT. These agencies are seekingmore efficient ways to build awarenessand capacities in
communities and at municipal level to address disaster risk. Since 2006 360 municipalities
have been consulted and received training on disaster risk management and how to incorporate
disaster risk management in territorial planning. These activities will continue over the next
three years.

73.     The Government of Colombia has a strong track record in terms of addressing
broader social impacts of disaster management. The experience in Bank-financed
operations for issues related to resettlement o f disaster-affected peoples and o f inhabitants o f
high-risk zones, in particular in the context o f the resettlement framework elaborated and
implemented for the APL 2, shows that the Government's policy approach and implementation
capacity inaddressing the social impacts related to hazard risk management are strong and well
established.

B.EnvironmentalAspects

74.     This operationis likely to have a significantpositiveimpacton the environment.

75.     The Ministry of the Environment,Housingand TerritorialDevelopmentis one of
the key agencies for disaster risk managementin Colombia. Since one of the objectives of
the operation is to support the Government's effort to mainstream disaster risk management
into a number o f key sectors, the operation's design i s proactive with respect to internalizing
environmental concerns, reflected in the role o f the MAVDT as one o f the key agencies for
disaster risk management inColombia. Improving capacities for disaster risk management will
have positive environmental impacts through better environmental management in territorial
planning, through improving security o f water supply and sanitation, and through strengthened
integrated watershed management. The MAVDT i s mandated to support local municipalities in
implementingbinding land-use zoning regulations.

76.    The Government's commitment to improved environmental management is
wholly imbeddedin the 2006- 2010 NationalDevelopmentPlan.For the first time inthree
administrations, the NDP includes a chapter dedicated to the Government's environmental
management strategy. This strategy draws directly upon the work undertaken through the
Sustainable Development DPL series and the findings o f the CEA.

     C. Implementation,Monitoring,andEvaluation

      77.        Three agencies are involvedin the coordination and monitoringof the proposed
      program. While the Ministry of Finance is the main counterpart of the Bank for this disaster
      risk management DPL with a CAT DDO, implementation of the program will be coordinated
      by the National Planning Department andthe Directorate for Disaster Preventionand Attention
      (Direccidn para la Prevencidn y Atencidn de Des~stres).~~

      78.        Bank staff will assist the Government in monitoring the progress of the
      implementationof the proposed operationduring the entire drawdownperiod.Given the
      characteristics of the DPL with a CAT DDO, the Bank i s responsible for monitoring the
      implementation of the program supportedby the DPL during the drawdown period (the period
      o f three years, which can be extended for up to four additional three-year periods, during
      which the loan with the DDO can be disbursed). This will be done through frequent visits to
      the country and regular communication with MHCP, DPAD, and DNP. Table 7 summarizes
      the selected benchmarks that the Government is working towards andthat will form parto fthe
      Government-Bank supervision dialogue. These benchmarks are drawn entirely from the
      Government's existing program of actions to reduce risks resulting from adverse natural events

D.FiduciaryAspects

79.    In general, Colombia's fiduciary environment for DPL operations is considered
adequate. Important progress has been achieved inthe modernization of the Public Financial
Management (PFM) systems and institutions at the central Government level (see Box 3). The
Bank continues to contribute to this effort, through PFM-related investment lending and
analytical/advisory services support.




                                                 31

                                        Box 3: Public Financial Management

Colombia has made important progress toward improving transparency and enhancing accountability in its public
financial management (PFM) systems. The national tax administration has undergone significant improvements
over the past five years in its systems and practices. Similarly, controls in public expenditure have been
strengthened through a comprehensive integrated financial management system, implementation o f a standard
internal control model, and reforms to the procurement system, such as the recently approved Procurement Law.
There is still, however, room for reducing transaction costs and exposure to waste and abuse, through the
implementation of risk managementtools, better procurement practices, and audit mechanisms.'

The administration's current strategy, documented in the National Development Plan's pillar o f "A State at the
Service o f its Citizens: Efficient and Effective Government," provides, inter alia, for the continuous improvement
o f public sector administrative models aiming at improved expenditure efficiency. The N D P explicitly addresses
important P F M areas such as budget management, asset administration, procurement reform, internal controls, and
results-based management.

Relevant improvements to the procurement system, such as the introduction o f merit evaluation as criteria for
selection o f consultant services, create an opportunity to converge with international good practice. Framework
contracts are also foreseen, which should translate into important savings in public procurement. However, there
are several aspects o f the reform that are still under way and will need to be evaluated as their implementation
progresses.

A public financial management andprocurement performance study is currently underway.


E.DisbursementandAuditing

  80.      MHCP has elected the deferred draw-down option as the disbursement mode for
 this operation. The DDO feature gives an IBRD borrower the option o f deferring
 disbursements under a DPL for up to three years, which can be extended up to four additional
 three-year periods during which the DPL with the DDO can be disbursed. Each extension will
 require the approval o fthe RegionalVice Presidento fthe Bank.

  81.     The CAT DDO may be drawn down at any time subsequent to a natural disaster
 resulting in a declaration of national emergency in accordance with Law Decree 919 of
  1989, or as it may be amendedby the Borrower at the time of disbursement.

 82.      If during the drawdown period the Bank concludes that the hazard risk
 managementprogram is not beingimplemented,the Bank will advise the Governmentof
 the need for a subsequent satisfactory review before the Bank will be able to grant any
 request for drawdown. Adequacy o f the macro economic framework is verified at inception
 andupon any subsequent renewals.

 83.      Following a request for withdrawal, the funds will be transferred into an account
 of the Central Bank (Banco de la Republica, BdR) denominated in US dollars. BdR will
 immediately credit the disbursed amounts to an MHCP National Treasury Account, where it
 will become available for financing budgeted expenditures under the national integrated
 Financial Information System. Upon request from the Bank, MHCP will provide written
 confirmation o f the mentioned transaction.




                                                       32

84.     An IMF central bank safeguard assessment of the BdR found no systematic
vulnerabilities in the safeguards of the BdR as of 2003 and updated in 2005. During
program appraisal, the Bank found nothing that caused it to believe that the control
environment into which the loanproceeds will flow is other thanadequate.

85.     Because of the described conditions, no additional fiduciary arrangements (for
example, dedicatedaccounts subject to audit) are deemed necessary for this Disaster Risk
ManagementDPLwith a CAT DDO.

F.Risks andRiskMitigation

86.     The proposedloanis considered to be of moderaterisk. The prior action neededfor
this loan has been achieved. Even so, progress of the overall program is subject to moderate
risks primarily due to the challenges that may derive from the inter-institutional arrangements
that need to continue to exist for multisector coordination, such as those associated with the
decentralization o f capacities for disaster risk management.

87.     There is a low risk associated with the procedures for disbursement. These
procedures by design should allow for a fast disbursement subsequent to a natural disaster, a
declaration o f national disaster, and a request for disbursement. The Bank has run two drills
with the Government in the context o f the APL 1, in which all involved agencies have
practiced their specific roles in accordance with the existing Colombian legal framework for
declaration o f national disasters. Both drills have resulted satisfactorily. The Bank will
continue to work closely with the Government to ensure prompt disbursement.

88.     The possibility of an economic downturn       --e.g., from a decline in exports to main
trading partners   -- could  make it more difficult for the Governmentto devote resources
to disaster risk reductionand hence affect the improvementof the Government's disaster
riskreductioncapacity (See Annex 2). To the extent that economic and financial conditions
impact government creditworthiness, then the ability o f the Government to finance its disaster
risk reduction could be negatively affected. This risk is perceived to be moderate. The risk of
the downturn is substantial in the current environment, and a possibly strong economic
downturn naturally would affect public investments.The Government's sound macroeconomic
policy stance and commitment to maintaining macroeconomic stability mitigates this risk. In
addition, the successful improvement o f the Government's disaster risk reduction capacity
depends to a large extent on its ability to avoid constructing unacceptable additional risks. This
i s achieved by internalizing disaster risk management into development planning at all levels,
which does not require large investmentbudgets.

              The main concern is the likely impact of the worldwide growth slowdown on the demand
              for Colombia's exports and a decline inthe terms of trade due to fallingcommodity prices.
              Colombia i s particularly vulnerable due to a highconcentration o f exports in commodities and a
              highconcentration ofexports for two destinations: the United States and Venezuela.

              Colombia faces an unfavorable external environment but the government has taken the
              necessary steps to mitigate it. Increasing risk aversion and liquidity hoarding by foreign
              investors may limit capital flows for the foreseeable future. To reduce external risks, the
              government has reduced the foreign currency share o f its public debt and overall external debt o f
             both the public and private sector is low at about 23 percent o f GDP. Inaddition, international
             reserves have increased substantially and now stand at over US$23 Billion.

Short-term impact
           An immediate impact of the turmoil has been an increase in stock price volatility and a
           significant rise in the EMBI spreads. The decline in the IGBC stock market index has been o f
           about 19.3% inthe past month (similar to other countries inthe region), but has seen a mild recovery
           in the last few days. The rise in EMBI spread is low relative to other countries in Latin America.
           The spread has started to decrease since end-October 2008. After having shown evidence o f a
           negative relation with the international oil price, the EMBIspread i s presenting a path more in line
           with the behavior in international markets, unlike other countries inthe region that are net exporters
           o f oil and which still show strong signs o f increase inrisk like Ecuador.

     0     A key concernfor Colombia is the likely impact of the globalgrowth slowdown on the demand
           for Colombia's exports and commodity prices.Colombia has a relatively open economy (exports
           o f goods and services are equivalent to over 17% o f GDP while total trade amounts to about 45
           percent o f GDP). In particular, oil exports represent around 24 percent o f total exports. While
           exports have become more geographically diversified towards other countries/regions beyond the
           U.S., the risk o f a global slowdown heightens the probability that export volumes and prices may be
           adversely affected. Indeed, export volumes have decreased somewhat already in the second quarter
           o f 2008, evidenced by a -0.8 percent real growth rate o f total exports over previous quarter34. This


34This deceleration inthe pace of exports follows a -2.6 percent decline during the first quarter o f 2008. Growthrates
refer to the variation respect to the previous quarter o f the seasonally adjusted export value in constant terms as
published by the Departamento Administrativo Nacional de Estadistica (DANE).

        has translated into a deceleration in GDP, which grew by only 3.7 percent q-0-q during the second
        quarter o f 2008 (compared to 8 percent inthe previous year).

    0   Likely impact of the US deceleration. According to a recent analysis o f the impact o f the US
        slowdown inthe Colombian economy35,the country seems to be relatively resilient to a recession in
        the US. The Colombian economy business cycle shows a small and negative correlation with the
        U S business cycle. Indeed, the impact o f a 0 percent growth rate o f the U S economy on GDP
        growth in Colombia i s estimated to be 0.4 percentage points. In contrast, other countries like
        Canada, Mexico and Venezuela would experience an estimated growth loss o f more than 1
        percentage point. Naturally, if the US slowdown has a higher impact worldwide, then the effect on
        the Colombian economy could be stronger as the country has strong trade relations with other
        regions like the Euro Area.

     0  Pressures on the exchange rate. The peso/dollar nominal exchange rate had appreciated over most
        o f 2008. However, more recently the exchange rate has shown signs o f depreciation and a much
        higher volatility than the evidenced during 2007.          As a result, the exchange rate since mid-
         September 2008 is more depreciated than duringthe same period o f last year.

        Limitedcapitalflight. The recent U.S. financial crisis has not ledto a substantial increase incapital
        outflows. Colombia holds a relatively low level o f portfolio investment. This combination reduces
        the risks o f potential market volatility affectingthe economy.

        High level of reserves. The country holds a high level o f international reserves (Net International
        Reserves reached US$23.5 billions as o f end-October 2008) which increases its capability o f coping
        with a financial crisis affectingthe economy.

        Low levelof foreign denominated debt The Colombian economy currently holds an approximate
        o f 75 percent o f its debt in local currency denominated instruments and only 25 percent in foreign
        currency. This additional element serves as a cushion for the potential transmission o f the external
        financial crisis to the economy.

     0  Remittances. The level o f remittances received by the Colombian economy is yet to be
        significantly affected by the crisis; however remittances remain vulnerable to the impact o f the
        global slowdown. As o f September 2008, remittances account to approximately 2.5 percent o f GDP.
        Recently, the remittances growth rate has been declining.

     0  Interest rates and Inflation. The Central Bank has increased interest rates moderately to contain
        inflationary pressures. However, the price hikes the economy has been experiencing are expected to
        be contained as the international food prices, a major driver of price increases in the country,
        continue towards a stabilization trend.

     0  Liquidity and Lending. The country is not showing evidence o f liquidity constraints as the share
        o f liquid assets has not experienced sharp movements over the past months. Gross domestic credit
        to the private sector continues growing and, although with a lower moderate growth rate over the
        past couple of months, keeps a strong pace. A potential risk i s that current global conditions might
        lead to less FDIand to a decrease in liquidity inthe exchange rate market.

Medium-termoutlook

    The global financial turmoil could intensify pressures on Colombia's economic activity as the
    world economy slows down. A decrease in commodity prices (possibly driven by a decrease in global
    demand) will tend to reduce Colombian exports. An increase in risk aversion might lead to capital
    outflows, increased pressures on the real exchange rate, a decrease in international reserves and
    increased in inflation. Inaddition, a decrease in global liquidity might lead to less FDIflows.

    The government has taken the necessary steps to mitigatethe risks from currentlynegativeglobal
    environment. To reduce external risks, the government has reduced the foreign currency share o f its
    public debt and overall external debt o f both the public and private sector is low at about 23 percent o f
    GDP.36 In addition, international reserves have increased substantially and now stand at over US$23
    Billion.




36 According to the recent debt reports published by the Banco de la Republica de Colombia, external debt of the
private sector is estimatedto remain belwo 8 percentof GDP during 2008, andpublic externaldebt is approximately 14
percent of GDP. In addition, external public debt is less than 1/3 of total public debt. See September and October
reports on externaldebt andpublic debt.

0  The economy is expected to slow even further in 2009. The fiscal position is projected to worsen,
   with a possible increase o f the non-financial public sector deficit (to 2.5% of GDP in 2009, the highest
   level in the last five years). The Government already anticipates international funding (from multilateral
   agencies) for its financing needs inthe order of US$2.4 billion for next year.. The impact inthe external
   accounts would bringthe current account deficit to as highas 3.5 percent of GDP in2009

    SensitivityAnalysis. Two scenarios are evaluated: the first one shows the impact of a drop of the
    oil priceto a low of $60 per barrel during 2009; and a second scenario adds a further deterioration
    in the external environment. As a result of these potential shocks economic growth could further
    deteriorate and the government balance would exhibit a higher deficit. The exchange rate will be
    significantly depreciated as a result of capital outflows pressures. Colombia has enough reserves to
    cushion potential shocks. None of these scenarios pose a serious problem to the public debt
    sustainability.

                                     Key Commodities:RecentTrendsandProspects

Commodity prices have been declining during the past months and expectations are that prices will
continue to soften. This is particularly important for a country like Colombia where oil exports represent
approximately 25 percent o f total merchandise exports, followed by coal (12 percent), coffee (6 percent) and
ferronickel (6 percent). The graphs that follow present the favorable recent trends that major commodities
for Colombia have exhibited inthe past years and how they are expected to behave over the medium term.

                                 Annex 5: Exposureto NaturalHazards in Colombia

     Colombia has the 1lth economic risk to multiple hazards in the world according to the
                                   highest
    Natural Disaster Hotspot study by the World Bank; 84.7 percent o f Colombia's population and
     86.6 percent o f its assets are located in areas exposed to two or more natural hazards.37The
    exposure i s to both low-frequency high-impact events such as earthquakes, volcanic eruption,
     and an occasional Atlantic hurricane, and to high-frequency but lower-impact events, such as
    floods and landslide.

     Seismic exposure

     Colombia i s situated on the confluence o f three tectonic plates; the Nazca Plate, the Caribbean
     Plate, and the South American plate, where the subduction o f these plates creates high seismic
     risk, as do the various geological fault lines: the Romeral fault line, Cauca and Magdalena, and
     Palestina and Frontal de la Cordillera Oriental. In Colombia, earthquakes are high-impact, low-
     frequency events. As i s evident by the map below, most o f the country, including all major urban
     areas, i s located in zones o f high or very high seismic risk due to the triple conjuncture o f the
     tectonic

Volcanic exposure

Volcanoes inColombia are distributedalong the central mountain range of the country. There are
six that are still active: Nevado de Ruiz, Galera, Dona Juana, Purace, Tolima, and Huila.

Floods

Large parts of Colombia's territory are susceptible to flooding, especially inthe lower basins and
valleys of the principal rivers: the Magdalena, Cauca, Sinu, Atrato, and Putumayo. Figure 3
indicates regions that are susceptible to flooding, based on previous events that have occurred
and on the area's topography.

   Landslides

   As mentioned above, landslides are the second most frequently occurring disasters in the
   country. This i s partly due to the topography o f the country, but a higher number can be
   attributed to hydrological phenomena; the softening of the ground due to heavy rains and the
   flooding o f bodies o f water are the main causes. The Natural Disaster Hotspot study by the
    World Bank41indicates that Colombia has the highest landslide risk in the Central American
    region, interms o f the number o f fatalities peryear per square kilometer.

                            Annex 6: Determinantsof Vulnerability in Colombia


    A natural disaster is the result of the occurrence o f naturalhazard event that affects a vulnerable
    community or assets. While natural hazardevents are largely exogenous factors that are hard or
    impossible to control, vulnerability is a manifestation o f the development patterns o f a given
    community.

    Vulnerability i s the degree o f susceptibility and resilience o f a community's assets, population,
    and environment inthe face o f change due to external conditions. Vulnerability i s a key factor to
    consider when trying to understand historical trends and analyzing potential impacts o f natural
    events on the country.

    Vulnerable populations around the world are economically fragile by definition and often have
    few or no assets and savings to help them recover from disasters. When a disaster strikes, it can
    destroy their existing wealth as well as their income opportunities and livelihoods, thereby
    further increasing their vulnerability.

    The remarkable increase inthe number of reported disaster events in Colombia (see annex 8) is
    to a large extent due to an increase in vulnerability, and possibly in part due to climatic trends.
    Vulnerability has largely increased in Colombia due to insufficiently planned urban growth,
    inadequate environmental management and land use planning, and lax application o f building
    codes.



    IncreasingPopulationinUrbanAreas

    As is the case inmost LatinAmerican countries, Colombia has seen a large increase inits urban
    population in the last fifty years. From 1950 to 2005, the percentage of Colombia's population
    living inurban areas increased from 39 percent to 73 percent42,and it is projected that by 2020,
    80 percent o f the population, or approximately 43 million people, will live in cities. This trend
    will bring with it important economic, social, and environmental challenges. It is fair to say that
    the future ofthe Colombia will depend on the future ofits cities.43

     UnplannedUrbanGrowth

     InColombia, the seven most important cities house 40 percent o fthe country's households and
     60 percent o f total household income.44 The biggest city is by far Bogota, with 18 percent o f
     households and where 30 percent o f household income is generated.

     With increased urbanization has come increased vulnerability, as most Colombian cities have
     followed an unplanned growth pattern. Some o f the most important challenges in urban areas
     include: the predominance o f unplanned expansions, a sharp increase in informal settlements,
     lack o f adequate construction practices, environmental degradation, poor transport infrastructure,
     and a lack o f adequate public spaces.

     Informal settlements are a physical and spatial manifestation o f poverty and inequality in cities.
     According to the latest census, conducted in 2005, in four o f Colombia's main cities, 18 percent
     o f the residential area corresponds to informal settlements. These areas usually suffer from a lack
     o f basic and social services and from prevalent unemployment. Currently close to 1.3 million
     homes in the country are in this situation (affecting 16 percent o f the total urban families in
     Colombia). O f these homes, 63 percent suffer from poor construction quality, and 20 percent are
     located in high risk areas. It has been estimated that 17 percent o f homes are in such inadequate
     quality or highrisk that it is not possible to conduct retrofit them.

     The environmental degradation that has resulted from the development o f areas that are not
     suitable for urbanization, such as damage to important water sources, loss o f vegetation
     coverage, loss o f natural drainage capacity, increased erosion, and so forth, has led to increased
     riskto naturaldisasters.

    Although Colombia has made substantial progress through important urban reforms and
    comprehensive legislation on territorial planning,45 the implementation and reinforcement of
    these laws have beenvery weak. For example, by 2005, eight years after the Territorial Planning
    Law # 388 passed in 1997, 97 percent of all the municipalities in the country and every major
    city with more than 100,000 inhabitants had adopted a Territorial Organization Plan (POT). The
    quality o f the POTs varies substantially-there                are a few very high-quality plans, but most are
    very weak. Only a few of these plans have implemented the management and financial tools
    made available by the legislation. For most, the relation between the POT and the Municipal
    Development Plans is not very clear. The Government of Colombia is working to change the
    perception of the POTs, so that they are understoodas avaluable tool for long-term planning and
    notjust another documentto comply with.

    DisplacementI s ExacerbatingUnplannedGrowth inUrbanAreas

    Internal population displacement in Colombia is one of the sources leading to this increase in
    urban population in the country. According to official regi~tries,~~ million people were  1.9
    displaced between 1995 and 2006. The problem was exacerbated between 2000 and 2002 as a
    result of increased violence and internal conflict.                     During that time, internal displacement
    increased325 percent on average, affecting 900 of the country's municipalities.

        From the period of 1970 to 2007, Colombia reported the highest number of natural disaster
        incidences in Latin America, averaging more than 600 a year. O f these, 36.8 percent were
        attributed to flooding, 25.5 percent to landslides, and 7.6 percent to urban fires.47 These small-
        scale but high-frequency disasters have generated damages equivalent to US$2.2 billion, left
        more than 9,000 people dead, impacted the lives of 14.8 millionpeople, destroyed 89,000 homes,
        damaged 185,000 homes, and ruinednearly 3 million hectares of cultivated land.48

     Some of the most damagingearthquakes inrecenthistory includethe following:

             InDecember 1979 a magnitude 8 earthquake occurred on the Pacific coast of Colombia
             near Tumaco; 300 people were killed and it caused approximately US$28 million in
             damages. Immediately after the earthquake a tsunami swept inland, destroying fishing
             villages and taking the lives of 672 people, destroying 3,08 1houses, and damaging 2,119.
             In total, 1,011 people were affected, and it was estimated that damages amounted to
             US$16.7 million; 0.06 percent damages estimated inproportionto GDP.
         0   The Popayan earthquake in 1983 caused 300 deaths, the destruction of 2,470 houses, and
             damage of 11,722. Twenty thousand people were affected, and there was approximately
             US$377,8 million indamages: 0.98 percent inproportion to GDP.
         0   Another devastating earthquake (6.4 on the Richter scale), which occurred in Quindio in
             January 1999, heavily affected the town of Armenia, causing severe economic and social
             impacts inthis coffee plantation region. It resulted inthe death of 1,186 people, impacted
             the lives of 1,205,933,        and caused damages of approximately US$1,857,366.
             Additionally, heavy losses were experiencedas a result of the destruction of 8,000 coffee
             farms.
         0   Most recently, in May 2008, El Calvario, a 5.9 magnitude earthquake occurred in the
             town of Puente Quetame, in Cundinamarca. Houses collapsed and reconstruction of the
             affected structures cost approximately US$10 million.

     One of the most catastrophic volcanic eruptions of the 20th century was the 1985 eruption o f
     Nevado del Ruiz. It resulted in the thawing of a glacier that turned into avalanches and lahars,
     which wiped out h e r o and partially destroyed the town of Chinchina. These avalanches
     caused approximately 25,000 deaths and 5,000 injuries. Nearly 15,000 people were direct1                z
     impacted, andthere were widespread economic losses. Damage was estimated at US$1 billion.
     InAnnero alone, the losses due to damages assets and commerce exceededUS$240 million, as
     nearly20,000 hectares of cultivated landwere buried, and20,000 headof livestock were lost.50

     There have also been damaging floods. In November 1970, 307 people died and 5,105,000
     people were affected. In 1984, a devastating flood that ranged across 1,680 square kilometers
     affected 194 thousand people, causing an estimated loss of US$400 million. In 2000, floods
     covered an area of 19 square kilometers, killing 96 people and affecting 500,000. More recently,
     floods inFebruary 2005 caused US$lO million indamages.

     Colombia has also been affected by hurricanes historically, though its location is somewhat
     protected from the common hurricane tracks. In October 1988 Hurricane Joan caused severe
     damage to the Caribbean coast of Colombia estimated at US$50,000,000 before it continued its
     westward pathand made landfall inBluefields,Nicaragua.

                    Annex 8: PotentialEconomicLosses of DisastersinColombia

      Information on disaster risk can take many forms, one o f them is the country's risk from a
     macroeconomic and financial perspective. The Disaster Deficit Risk (DDI)" measures the
      economic loss that a country could suffer if a catastrophic event takes place and the implications
      interms ofresources neededto addressthe situation.

      The DDI is the relationship between the demand for contingent resources to cover the losses
      generated by the maximum considered event (MCE) and the economic resilience. The M C E is
      calculated based on a model that takes into account diverse hazards and the physical
      vulnerability o f elements exposed to it. The economic resilience i s defined as the availability o f
      internal and external funds for restoring affected inventories. The following equation shows the
      relationship:

              DDI =Maximum ConsideredEvent Loss /Economic Resilience

     A DDIgreater than 1.O denotes a lack of financial capacity to face extreme disasters, outstripping
      even resources available when accruing as much indebt as possible. A bigger DDIrepresents a
      biggerdeficit.

     Table 1 presents the estimations o f the DDI for Colombia between 1980 and 2000 (every five
     years) for an M C E with 50, 100, and 500 years o f return period (correspondingly 2 percent, 10
     percent, and 18 percent probability of occurrence in 10 years). The DDI i s greater than 1 for
     maximum events with 100 and 500 years o f return, implying that in this case, the country does
     not have enough resources to face losses and to restore the affected capital. On the other hand,
     for events with a returnperiod o f 50 years, Colombia has the capacity to cover the reconstruction
     costs with internal and/or external funds.

     According to comparative estimations o f the DDIfor an M C E with 500 years o f return period in
     year 2000, all countries in Latin America and the Caribbean region but Costa Rica have a DDI
     greater than 1 (see figure 1). Colombia, with a DDI o f 5.4, is the second most critical case after

Dr.Robert Zoellick
President
World Bank
Washington, D.C.

Dear Dr. Zoellick:

It is internationally recognized as a priority to find ways to adequately address tendencies as
global warming, the widespread pollution o f water, high levels o f energy consumption,
environmental deterioration, and the increase in the occurrence o f disasters o f natural and
anthropogenic origins. In light o f this, the second administration o f President Alvaro Uribe
VClez remains committed in its efforts to guarantee a sustainable development for Colombia.
Development that will allow the country to move towards its development goals, as stated inthe
National Development Plan2006 -2010 "Community State: Development for All".

The United Nations Environment Program's (UNEP's) principles of sustainable development
recommend the integration o f diverse factors that imply a reframing o f the political, economic,
social, productive, technological, and administrative systems. According to UNEP, sustainable
development should guarantee adequate conditions for the population and a safe quality o f life.
It should also ensure the existence o f appropriate conditions for economic growth. Inorder to
do this, planning processes should integrate environmental and risk factors, in addition to
economic and social ones.

Today, it i s widely accepted that disasters are, to a certain extent, the result o f inadequate
development processes. Increase in the vulnerability to a variety o f hazards, intensified by
environmental degradation and frequently manifested in scenarios o f disaster, ratifies the need
to integrate environmental and risk management and to promote its articulation with the
differenteconomic sectors.

There is evidence that the populations that are most vulnerable to the occurrence of natural
disasters are those who live in conditions o f poverty and that are settled in zones o f high non
mitigable risk. These populations are affected mainly in terms o f health and productivity. The
impact o f disasters o f natural and anthropogenic origins on human, economic and social losses
i s proportionately higher when affecting poor or developing countries.

Colombia has the highest level o f occurrence o f natural disasters in Latin America. On average,
there were more than 600 events per year during the past 30 years. Most highly recurrent
phenomena are floods, landslides and urbanfires. The negative impact o f some recent disasters
on economic and social development has been documented. According to estimations, the
damages o f the coffee region earthquake (1999) corresponded to 1.84 percent o f the National
Domestic Product, and those o f the Popayan earthquake (1983) to 0.98 percent.



                                              63

Colombia's commitment with disaster risk management has a long history. The Popayan
earthquake generated a process that had as a result the establishment o f the National System for
Prevention and Attention o f Disasters (SNPAD), Decree 919 o f 1989, and the adoption o f the
National Preventionand Attention o f Disasters Planin 1998,Decree 93 o f 1998.

The SNPAD i s an inter-sector and territorially decentralized system that promotes the
participation o f the private sector, the public institutions and the community. It i s characterized
by giving autonomy to the municipalities regarding risk reduction planning, emergency
attention, rehabilitation and post-disaster recovery activities. In this sense, the actions o f the
regional and national governments subsidy and complement the capacity o f municipalities
concerning risk control intheir jurisdictions.

Regarding risk reduction, it i s relevant to emphasize the profound effect o f the territorial
planning process started in 1997 with the passing o f Law 338. This process allowed the inclusion
o f corrective and prospective criteria for disaster risk management, by defining the uses and occupations
o f the territory, as well as other territorial planning aspects. This has allowed the local administrations to
correct and improve the urban development tendencies and to reduce illegality and informality within
these processes.

The Government has initiated the strengthening o f the National System for Disaster Prevention and
Management in order to use it as a strategic instrument for risk management. Therefore the National
Development Plan 2006-2010: Estado Comunitario: Desarrollo para Todos (NDP) specifically includes
the strategic lines o f environment and risk management to promote sustainable development. The
strategies expressed in the NDP correspond to the goals expressed in the document Visidn Colombia
2019.

The Government o f Colombia continues committed in its effort to strengthen disaster risk management
in the following areas: (i)improving risk identification and monitoring; (ii)increasing risk prevention
and risk mitigation measures; (iii)strengthening policies and institutions; and (iv) reducing
fiscal vulnerability in the event o f a disaster. Because o f this, during the following three years
Colombia expects to move forward inthe following aspects: (i)               increase the seismic and hydro
meteorological systems, increase the capacity to monitor volcanoes; (ii)technically assist
municipalities inthe inclusiono f disaster risk management intheir development planningand in
the development o f policy instruments for the management o f high risk non mitigable
settlements; (iii)   improve instruments for resettlement o fpeople inhighrisk areas, (iv) structure
a proposal to update the normative framework o f SNPAD; and (v) elaborate a national financial
strategy proposal for the event o f a disaster that allows the transfer o f disaster risk to the
insurance sector. This activities aim at the reduction o f people affected by volcanic eruptions,
the increase of people benefitted by flood risk mitigation activities, and the increase o f
municipalities that include risk management intheir territorial and development planning.

In regard to this last point, Colombia has given recent steps in the definition of financial
strategies at the national level and for some cities, with the purpose o f reducing fiscal
vulnerability inthe event o f a natural disaster. Today, the national government and some local
governments have started using strategies o f collective insurance instruments as soft loans and
contingent credits as possible solutions to the fiscal vulnerability problem.




                                                      64

A stable macroeconomic environment is essential for the implementation and strengthening the
disaster risk management program. In this respect, during the last years the Government o f
Colombia has successfully designed and executed an economic program that strengthens public
finances. Results of this program started to be seen in 2004 and have progressively
consolidated.

The main goals of the program are to stabilize public debt and to gradually reduce fiscal deficit,
which guarantees structural sustainability o f public finances, by focusing on a reduction o f
present and future expenses and on increasing fiscal income. The improvement o f the fiscal
trends has been significant, as evidenced by macroeconomic results o f recent years. For
example, the deficit o fthe Consolidated Public Sector went from 1.3% o f GDP in2004 to 0.8%
in2007.

Evidence of the success o f the plan is also shown by economic growth figures: the GDP grew
7.5% in2007, which i s higher thanthe 6.8% GDP growth o f 2006. Solid foundations o f growth
allow forecasting that Colombia has "jumped" to a more favorable growth path with clear
positive consequenceson employment and welfare. This growth i s due especially to an increase
ininternal demandthat was favored by the increase ininvestment (26.9% in2006 and 21-2%in
2007). In addition, final consumption o f households has also increased because o f the
improvement in the economic conditions and o f the rise o f the private sector's trust in the
economic situation o f Colombia. Moreover, the increase in exports contributed to GDP's
growth.

Meanwhile, the Government o f Colombia remains conscious o f the importance of persisting in
its efforts to develop and strengthen the national framework for risk transfer and funding, with
the goal of reducing the need to use external sources o f funding in the months following the
occurrence of a disaster o f highmagnitude. For all the above reasons, the National Government
requests the support and the technical assistance o f the Bank in the preparation o f a contingent
credit line of free use (CAT-DDO).

Inlight ofthe foregoing, the Government ofColombia wouldlike to reiterate its commitment to
the disaster risk management program presented in this document, and welcomes the
opportunity generated by the contingent credit line CAT-DDO.

               A nivel internacionales reconocida la importancia que durante las prdximasdbcadas
               tendre el calentamiento global, la contaminacidn end6mica del agua, el consumo de
                energla, el deterioro del medio ambiente y el incremento en la ocurrencia de
                desastres de origen natural y, antrdpico. Consiente de io anten'or, la segunda
               administracidn del PreSideRte Alvaro Uribe Vblez continlia comprometida en sus
               esfuerzos por garantizar un desarrollo sostenible para Colombia, que le perrnita al
               pais avanzar en 10s objetivos econdmicos, sociales y ambientaies, tal y como se
               evidencia en el Plan Nacional de Desarrollo 2006          -2010                                 I

               desarrollo paratodos".

                Los postuladosdel desarrollo sostenible acogidos por el Programa de las Naciones
                Unidas para el Medio Ambiente (PNUMA) consideran la integracionde factores que
               implican el replanteamiento de sistemas politicos, econdmicos, sociales,
               productivos, tecnoldgicos y administrativos. Ei desarrollo sostenible debe asegurar,
                entre otros aspectos, que la poblacidn tenga condiciones adecuadas y seguras de
               calidad de vida y que existan las condiciones propicias para el crecimiento
                econdmico. Por io anterior, ios procesos de planificacidn deben integrar no
               soiarnente consideraciones sociales y econdmicas, sino tambikn ambientales y del
                riesgo.

                Hoy en dia se reconoce que 10s desastres son, en buena parte, el resultado de
               procesos de desarrollo inadecuados. El aumento de las condiciones de
               vulnerabilidad ante ciertas amenazas, intensificadas en algunos casos por la
               degradacidnambientaly manifestada en escenarios de desastre, es una ratificacidn
               de la necesidad de integrar la gestidn ambiental y del riesgo, promoviendo su
               articulacidn con 10s diferentes sectores de la economia.

                Por otra parte, existe evidencia de que las poblaciones mas vulnerables ante la
                 currencia de desastres son aqueilas que viven en condiciones de pobreza y

            un promediode m8s de 600 eventos por afio durante ios ljltimos30afios,siendo ios
            fendmenosde mayor recurrencia las inundaciones,10s deslizamientosde tierray 10s
            incendios urbanos. Las cifras muestran el impact0 que algunos desastres recientes
            han tenido en el desarrollo econdmico y social de Colombia. Segljn estimaciones,
            10s dafios del terremoto del eje cafetero (1999) ascienden al 1.84% del Product0
            lnterno Bruto, y 10s del terremoto de Popaydn(1983) el 0.98%.

            El compromiso de Colombia con la gestidn del riesgo tiene una larga historia. El
            terremoto de Popaydn generd un proceso que Hevd al establecimiento del Sisterna
            Nacional para la Prevencidn y Afenci6n de Desastres (SNPAD), Decreto 919 de
            1989,y a laadopcidn del Plan Nacionalpara la Prevencidny Atenci6n de Desastres,
            Decreto93 de 1998.

            El SNPAD es intersectorial y descentralizado territorialmente. Asirnismo, promueve
            la participacidn del sector privado, las instituciones pljblicas y la comunidad. El
            Sistemase caracteriza por dar autonornlay responsabilidadesa 10s municipiosen la
            planeacidn de actividades de reduccidn del riesgo, de atencidn a emergencias y

            sentido, la acci6n de 10s gobiernos regionales y nacionalessubsidia y cornplementa
            la capacidadde 10s municipios.

            En lo relacionadocon la reduccidndel riesgo, vale la pena resaltar el efecto que ha
            tenido el procesode ordenamientoterritorialiniciado en 1997con laexpedicidnde la
            Ley 388, el cual ha logradoavanzar en la incorporation de criterioscorrectivos en la

            El Gobierno de Colombia ha asumido el compromiso de fortalecer su Sistema
            Nacional para la Prevencidn y Atencidn de Desastres, convirtihdolo en un
            instrumento estrategico para la gestidn del riesgo en el pals. Portal motivo, el Plan

   Colombia ha avanzado recientemente en la definicidn de estrategias financieras a
   nivelnacional, y para algunas de sus ciudades, con el fin de reducir la vulnerabilidad
   fiscal ante la ocurrencia de desastres naturales. En la actualidad, el gobierno
   nacional, y algunos gobiernos locales, han comenzado a utilizar las estrategias de
   aseguramiento colectivo e instrurnentos tales como crbditos blandos y creditos
   contingentes,como posiblessolucionesal problemade la vulnerabilidad fiscal.

   En este sentido, y con el fin de asegurar el fortalecimientode la gestidn del riesgo,
   es fundamentalcontar con un entorno macroecon6mico estable que sirva de base
   para su irnplementacidn. AI respecto, durante 10s dltimos afios el Gobiemo
   colombiano ha logrado diseiiar y ejecutar de manera exitosa un programa
   econdmico para ei fortalecimiento de 18s finanzas pdblicas, cuyos resultados se
   comenzaron a observar durante 2004y se han idoconsolidando progresivamente.

   Los principalesobjetivosde dicho programaeconornico han sido la estabilizacidnde
   la deuda pljblica y la reduccldn del deficit fiscal de una manera gradual para
   garantizar la sostenibilidad estructural de las finanzas pljblicas, enfocandose en
   disminuir 10s gastos presentes y futuros y en incrementar 10s ingresos fiscales. La
   tendencia hacia ei mejoramiento de la situacidn fiscal ha sido significativa y se
   evidencia en 10s resultados de anos recientes. Por ejemplo, el deficit del Sector
   PijblicoConsolidado pas6 de 1.3% del PIB en 2004 a un deficit de 0.8% del PIB en
   2007.

   El desarrollo del plan economico para fortalecer las finanzas pdblicas ha surtido
   efecto, considerando 10s logros en crecimiento econdmico que se han obtenido
   durante 10s dltimos aiios. Una evidencia de 10s excelentes resultados es el
   crecimientodel PI6 de 7.5% en 2007, mayor que el registradoen 2006 (6.8%).Las
   bases de este buen crecimiento permiten prever que Colombia ha "saltado" a una
   senda de crecimiento mls favorable con evidentes repercusiones positivas en
   materia de empleo y bienestar de 10s colombianos. Este crecimiento se debe
   especialmente al aumento de la demanda interna del pars, que se vi0 favorecidapor
   el aumento de la inversidn, la cual crecid 26.9% en el 2006 y 21.2% en el 2007.
   Adlclonalmente, el consumo final de 10s hogares tambien ha registrado un
   crecimiento favorable, dadas las mejores condiciones econdmicas y la mayor
                    sector privado en la situacidn econdmica del pais. De otra parte, el
                     las exportaciones contribuydpositivamente al crecimientodel PIB.

A pesar de estos avances, el Gobierno de Colombia es consciente de la importancia
de continuar con sus esfuerzos por desarrollar y fortalecer su marc0 nacional de
transferencia y financiacidn del rlesgo, con el objetivo de atender de rnanera
adecuada la necesidad de recursos requerida en 10s meses siguientes a la
ocurrencia de un desastre nacional de gran magnitud. Por Io anterior, el Gobierno
Nacional solicita el apoyo del Banco en la preparacidn de una llnea de credit0

              Annex 13: Colombian LegalFramework for Disaster Declaration

NationalConstitution

Declaration of a State of Emergency

Article 215 o f the Colombian Constitution establishes that, upon the likelihood o f events that
disturb or threaten imminently to disturb the economic, social, and ecological order in the
country, or that become a grave public calamity, the president i s empowered to declare a state
o f emergency for up to 30 days, not to exceed 90 days ina calendar year.

Through such a declaration, the president can create presidential decrees with the force of law,
aimed exclusively at addressing issues related to the crisis. Such decrees are limitedto matters
directly related to the state o f emergency or to the establishment o f new taxes or fees. In such
cases, new revenue measures will cease to apply at the end o f the next fiscal term, unless
Congress grants them permanent status. The Government, in the decree in which it declares a
state o f emergency, will signal the term during which it will make use o f the extraordinary
faculties.

Law Decree 919 of 1989

National Systemfor Disaster Management and Prevention

Law Decree 919 o f 1989 established the National System for Disaster Management and
Preventionand created the basis upon which the following legal instruments were created:

Article 19 establishes the mechanism for declaration o f disaster as follows:

 "The President o f the Republic can declare through decree and previous concept of the
National System for Disaster Management and Prevention, and in the same act will classify it
according to magnitude and effects, as o fnational, department, district, or municipal level."

The declaration o f a disaster can take place up to three months after the occurrence o f events. In
that way, as long as no declaration from the presidenthas been issued informing the return to a
state o f normalcy, he is empowered to modify the classification given to the disaster and thus
the regimethat can be applied.

Once disaster has been declared, the relevant norms from the special regime will be applied to
the disaster situation as specified in the decree. Administrative authorities, according to the
specific circumstance, can be established.

Article 24 refers specifically to the special administrative regime for disaster situations,
including applicable legal norms related to contracts; fiscal controls; procurement,
expropriation; occupation and demolition; imposition o f rights o f way and eminent domain;
conflict resolution; indebtness and debt refinancing; incentives for rehabilitation, construction

and development; administration o f grants; and the authorization, control, surveillance, and
investmentof granted goods.

Declaration of Public Calamity

Article 48 establishes that:

 "Any situation that does not rise to the level of gravity mentioned inArticle 18 of this decree,
produced by the same causes identifiedwithin, i s considered a situation o f public calamity, the
occurrence o f which may be declared by the National Office for Prevention and Attention o f
Disasters through an administrative act that will determine if such an occurrence i s considered
to be o f national, department, district, or municipal scale."

In the case of a declaration of Disaster or Public Calamity, the Director of the National
Directorate for Disaster Prevention and Management will "proceed to elaborate, based upon the
National Plan, a customized action plan to manage the situation o f the declared event, which
will be mandatory by character for all public and private entities who will be required to
contribute to its execution, withinthe timeframementioned inthe declaration."

customized action plan to manage the declared disaster, and such action plan will be o f a
mandatory nature for all public and private entities who will have to contribute to its execution,
within the timeframe mentioned in the declaration. Whenever such a declaration is related to
situations classified as department, commissary, district, or municipal in scale, the action plan
will be elaborated and coordinated in its execution by the respective Regional or Local
Committee, according to the established guidelines dictated by the decree o f declaration, or
those that modify it, and with the instructions received by the National Committee, Technical
Committees, and the National Office for Preventionand Attention o f Disasters."

                   Annex 15: Colombia's DisasterRiskManagementPerformance

    Table 1, below, shows Colombia's performance on an index designed to assess disaster risk
    management. The index, developed by the National University of Colombia and the IADB,54
    provides a qualitative measure o f management based on predefined benchmarks that risk
    management efforts should aim to achieve. The index i s a subjective evaluation by public
    officials in the system based on standardized questionnaires. As such the score i s relative to
    Colombia's stated goals rather than directly comparable to other countries scores on the same
    index. The table shows that Colombia has made significant advances over the past two decades.
    The two indicators in the areas of risk identification and risk reduction illustrate the important
    strategic move from disaster response to disaster risk management, which has been inprogress
    since the mid-1990s. Table 1i s inthe process o f beingupdated to reflect status as o f March 1,
    2009. The updated table will inform the Government on their progress on strengthening their
    disaster risk management framework.
