TANZANIA
FOODGRAIN STORAGE AND MILLING PROJECT
I. THE AGRICULTURAL AND RURAL SECTOR
A.  Background
1.01      Tanzania's population (for the mainland about 15.5 million in
1977) is increasing at about 3% per annum. Per capita GNP for 1978 is esti-
mated at US$230. Real growth of GDP averaged about 5.0% per annum over
1976-78. Roughly 50% of GDP is derived from agriculture and related activ-
ities, more than half of this from subsistence production.  More than 90% of
the population reside in rural areas, the majority engaged in agriculture.
About 70% of Tanzania's foreign exchange earnings from merchandise exports are
accounted for by unprocessed agricultural commodities, and a further 7% by
processed farm products. The major export commodities are coffee, cotton,
sisal, tobacco, tea and cashewnuts.
1.02      Large-scale agriculture is confined to a small number of private
estates and state farms producing sisal, coffee, tea, sugar, wheat, rice
and livestock. The largely traditionally managed national livestock herd,
estimated at 12 million head, is grazed extensively over the 40% of the
country free from tsetse fly.
1.03      Recent performance of the agricultural sector has been somewhat
sluggish. Over the period 1967-77, the average annual rate of growth of
agricultural production was about 2.7%, less than the estimated population
growth. From the late 1960's onward, food crop production also failed to keep
pace with population growth and, as a result, Tanzania became increasingly
dependent on imports of maize, rice and wheat. This slow growth was due to a
number of reasons (para. 2.02), and its effects were exacerbated in 1973 and
1974 by the effects of a severe drought which resulted in poor harvests and
the need for large imports of food grains. Since 1976, agricultural produc-
tion has recovered from the effects of the drought, increasing in real terms
at an average of about 7%, at the same time that there has been a shift in the
pattern of production away from cash export crops toward food crop production.
Nevertheless, increasing demand for food crops has meant that Tanzania has
continued to depend on imports of rice and wheat. Further information
on the food crop sub-sector is found in Chapter II.
B.   Agriculture and Crop Marketing
1.04      The Government has undertaken a comprehensive program to support
the development of the agricultural sector, in conjunction with efforts to
achieve balanced regional growth and equitable income distribution. Within
these objectives, Government is paying particular attention to achieving
self-sufficiency in food production and to supporting export crops. In the
past few years, greater emphasis has been placed on the productive rather
than on the social aspects of rural development projects than was true in the
late 1960s and early 1970s. Beginning in 1970, the Government launched a
wide-ranging program to resettle the country's rural population into villages
in order to facilitate the provision of infrastructure and services to the
rural population, and to encourage self-reliance and a community approach to
rural development. There are now about 7,700 registered villages, containing



over three-quarters of Tanzania's rural population. The village is intended
to be the country's primary social, economic and political unit. With respect
to crop marketing, village councils (elected in each village of 250 families
or more) now purchase crops from farmers on behalf of parastatals. This
serves to reinforce the village as an economic entity, receiving a commission
for its marketing services which can then be used for village infrastructure.
At the same time, however, it creates problems at the village level for record
keeping of individual farmers and, in villages without storage facilities, for
storing crops until parastatals can transport them to their own storage
facilities. Tnere is considerable potential for improvements in crop market-
ing at the village level through village investment in storage facilities and
in small-scale mills and through training of villagers in the proper grading,
handling and storage of crops. Funds for village stores are being provided
under several IDA-assisted projects, I/ and within 2-3 years it will be
possible to evaluate the demand for such stores.
1.05      Cooperatives.  Until 1976, local cooperative marketing societies
marketed all major agricultural commodities in Tanzania and private trading
in these crops was officially banned, although informal marketing channels
existed. These societies were affiliated with regional cooperative unions
which provided the link between the societies and the marketing parastatals.
Cooperatives were generally over-extended and suffered from shortages of
trained and experienced manpower and from financial difficulties. Neverthe-
less, they served an important marketing function for inputs and outputs. In
May 1976, because of increasing friction between the Ujamaa 2/ and cooperative
movements, the Government abolished all cooperative societies, and the villages
took over their crop marketing functions. Cooperative unions were dissolved
and their functions were transferred to national, regional and district
institutions such as the District Development Corporations, Regional Trading
Companies, and the parastatal crop authorities. Parastatals were expected to
purchase crops directly from villages, which greatly increased their burden
because of the large number of outlets, and since 1976 have been trying to
develop the organizational, transport and handling capacity to do this.
Particularly for food crop marketing, which is the responsibility of the
National Milling Corporation, the difficulties have been compounded by the
large number of (over ten) crops marketed and the fact that the marketing
encompasses the entire country.
1.06      Parastatals.  There are separate parastatals which deal with vil-
lages for coffee, cotton, sisal, tea, tobacco, cashelwnuts, pyrethrum, sugar,
livestock and dairy products and food crops. Generally, ambitious expecta-
tions have placed severe s rains on their manpower resources, since they not
only now provide marketing services directly to villages (para 1.05), but
provide processing services and have development responsibilities as well.
1.07      Parastatal marketing is usually characterized by lack of competi-
tion, high costs, poor service and slow payments to farmers. The Government

is aware of these problems and its Standing Committee on Parastatal Organiza-
tion (SCOPO) is reviewing the structure and managerial performance of para-
statals. The Bank Group is assisting in this process through its analysis
of parastatals involved in recent and proposed lending operations, e.g., the
Cashewnut Authority, the Tobacco Authority, the Tea Authority, the Pyrethrum
Authority, and the National Milling Corporation (NMC) (see Chapter III).
1.08      Rural Transport Services.  An adequate road transport system is
needed to ensure the efficient movement of crops to market centers and rail-
heads, and to support timely delivery of agricultural inputs to the farmers.
Despite Government's efforts to upgrade the road network, only about 10
percent of the 33,400 km of roads provide reliable, all weather service. The
remainder are, in general, little more than earth tracks impassable in the
rainy seasons. Rural roads are in especially poor condition. In addition,
the trucking fleet available for use by parastatals (either through owner-
ship or hire) has been limited, thus making crop movement even more diffi-
cult. Crop marketing has suffered from high transport costs, and deterioration
of crops in villages with inadequate storage facilities. While poor transport
facilities cause delays in payment to villages, often they also dictate
that villages receive sums large enough to handle crops over extended periods,
leading to inadequate supervision and accounting of funds advanced for pur-
chases. Current Government action to address these problems is directed
mainly at the public sector, and includes the provision of staff training and
equipment and construction of secondary roads under several IDA-assisted
projects, 1/ and the recent creation of the Betterment and Maintenance Units,
which are upgrading selected secondary roads in several regions. Assistance
to the public trucking industry is being provided through the IDA-supported
Trucking Industry Rehabilitation and Improvement Project (Cr. 743-TA). This
has not proved sufficient to overcome transport bottlenecks in the critical
areas of large procurement of food crops and the Government, under IDA
assisted projects 2/, has provided parastatals with additional transport
facilities.
II. THE FOOD CROP SUB-SECTOR
A.   Food Crop Production
2.01      Estimates of food crop production are unreliable, as most production
goes for subsistence consumption, and of the surplus that is marketed, a
substantial but unquantified portion goes into unofficial channels. Data on
acreage and yields are also imprecise, and estimates by various organizations
and agencies show considerable differences.
i/   These include the Highways Maintenance Project (Credit 507-TA), and road
components in the Tabora Regional Development Project (Credit 703-TA),
the Geita Cotton Project (Credit 454-TA), the Mwanza-Shinyanga Rural
Development Project (Credit 803-TA) and Kigoma Rural Development Project
(Credit 508-TA).

Maize Project (Credit 606-TA).



-4-
2.02      Food crop production in Tanzania is characterized by large year
to year variations, but over the past fifteen years there has been some
upward trend, which has not, however, kept pace with increases in population.
This is the result of a number of factors: intermittently poor weather, low
producer prices offering insufficient incentives, and villagization which
moved many farmers far from their cultivation and introduced greater un-
certainty into their situation. In 1973 and 1974, production was particularly
affected by drought, and resulted in large food crop deficits. Since 1975
there has been an apparent recovery, which can be attributed to a number of
factors: better weather, a concentration of Government effort directed at
subsistence production, and increases in producer prices. Nevertheless, the
food crop sector can still be generally characterized by traditional cul-
tivation methods, low yields and vulnerability to changes in weather.

1/   The sources for these series are the Marketing Development Bureau (MDB)
Price Recommendations, 1978/79 and 1979/80.  Other series, by FAO and
USDA, for example, present figures that are considerably different from
these, in some cases by a factor of 2 or 3, and although the general
trends are similar, year to year variations are sometimes in opposite
directions.  (See IDA preparation report on grain storage and milling).
2.03      Maize is the most important food crop, grown by more than 50% of
Tanzanian farmers, for both subsistence and commercial uses. Less than 1% of
total production comes from large-scale commercial farms. Rice is also an
important subsistence crop in Tanzania and second only to maize in terms of
volume and value of crops marketed officially. Smallholders have traditionally
dominated production, but the National Agricultural Farming Corporation
(NAFCO) state farms have recently produced about 5% of total supply and an
increasing portion (about 20%) of the officially marketed surplus. Wheat
production is dominated by large-scale farms, with smallholders accounting for
perhaps one-third of the area planted to wheat, but only about 5% of officially
marketed production. Production of other food crops, including cassava, white



- 5 -
sorghum and bulrush millet, has traditionally supplied, after maize production,
an important source of subsistence food in semi-arid areas. It is estimated
that about 40% of farming families in Tanzania grow these crops.
2.04      Research on individual food crops (maize, sorghum, millets, tuber
crops and legumes) is financed by several bilaterals, of which USAID is the
principal one, to find improved varieties and to improve input packages for
greater yields.
B.   Food Crop Marketing and Processing
2.05      The minor part of food crops that is marketed passes either through
informal private channels or through the official channel of the National
Milling Corporation (NMC, Chapter III). The quantity of crops marketed
officially in any year (Table 2) depends on the levels of production, the size
of the surplus available for marketing, and the official prices fixed by
Government relative to the prices in the informal market, including those
in neighboring countries, and the number of NMC's purchasing centers. Of the
total quantities marketed, roughly 50-70% of the maize and about 50% of the
paddy, rice and wheat pass through informal markets. Because of year-to-year
variations and the unreliable data base, it is difficult to project levels of
official purchases. Purchases of other food crops, including sorghum, bulrush
millet, finger millet and cassava, have only recently become official. These
have traditionally served as subsistence drought-resistant crops in semi-arid
areas, but as producer prices for these crops have increased, in some cases by
50-100% in two years, official purchases have increased dramatically.
This has created enormous problems for NMC, because it has been unable to
dispose of them in the domestic market (para 2.09).
2.06      About one-third of the milling activities are carried out by para-
statal organizations (NMC and NAFCO) and the remaining two-thirds by smaller-
scale private groups or individuals. Milling in the private sector is done in
village mills, owned by an individual or a small group and used as a substitute
for hand-milling. About 25% of the 8,000 villages in Tanzania now have one or
more maize or rice mills. The private sector also includes custom mills in
urban areas, which are used to help satisfy urban demand. Their number and
capacity are not known, and although NMC sometimes contracts them to meet peak
demand requirements, they are probably decreasing in numbers, because spare
parts are scarce and Government pricing policies have reduced profits.
C.   Consumer Demand and Projections
2.07      In spite of increased official purchases of paddy, rice and wheat,
Tanzania has been a net importer of rice and wheat; Tanzania, however, has
been able to export maize in some years, although it has also imported large
quantities in years of bad weather (Table 2). Projections of import require-
ments (Annex 1, Table T-1) are based on a number of assumptions about future
purchases, storage losses, extraction rates, and domestic demand and are
therefore approximate.   The projections do not take into account substantial
year-to-year variations in production surpluses due to weather changes, so
that for maize in particular, Tanzania will probably continue to be an exporter
in some years and an importer in others. For rice and wheat, Tanzania will
continue to rely on imports to satisfy at least half of domestic demand.

D.   Government Policies
2.08      Within the general goal of agricultural development. with emphasis
on interregional income distribution, the Government seeks to reduce the
country's vulnerability to drought and move toward self-sufficiency in
food production. Resulting policies include development projects aimed at
increasing foodcrop production, 1/ setting producer and consumer prices within
a system of panterritorial pricing (para. 2.11), establishing a strategic
grain reserve, and assuring marketing channels by requiring NMC to purchase
all crops offered for sale. Pricing policy in particular has been a problem
because Government has tried to achieve a number of goals through price-setting,
resulting in parastatal inefficiencies and losses (paras. 2.09-2.12).
2.09      Since the drought in 1973-74, and the resultant food crop short-
ages, Government has used producer prices to provide incentives to increase
production. Accordingly, producer prices of food crops relative to other
export crops, and producer prices of drought-resistant food crops (cassava,
sorghum, millets) relative to other crops have been raised considerably since
1972/73 (Table 3). The impact on the economy has been to encourage production
and increase sales to NMC, particularly of the drought-resistant crops, with
probably an adverse impact on export crop production. 2/ This policy has
created considerable problems for NMC. NMC has been able to sell only small
quantities of cassava and white sorghum flours, and the rest has accumulated
in NMC stores, taking up valuable storage space, and causing severe financial
problems for NMC (paras 3.18 - 3.19). In 1978, NMC was allowed to start
exporting these crops and has found European and Middle-Eastern markets where
they are being sold as animal feed, but at prices considerably below their
costs.
1/   Including IDA-assisted projects such as Kigoma Rural Development (Credit
508-TA), Tabora Rural Development (Credit 703-TA), Mwanza-Shinyanga Rural
Development (Credit 803-TA), and NMP (Credit 606-TA). There are also a
number of schemes proposed for rice production, and, for wheat, Canadian
bilateral aid is financing projects.
2/   Exports of agricultural cash crops have, except for tobacco and tea,
either decreased dramatically or stagnated since 1973. Exports of
cotton and cashewnuts, which are both grown in the same areas as cassava,
decreased in volume in 1978 to about one-half of the average for 1973 and
1974.

1/   A consumer price index using 1972/73 as a base year would be at 226 for
1978/79. In real 1972/73 terms, therefore, producer prices of all food
crops (except wheat) have gone up by at least 15-20%, while real
producer prices of cashewnuts and tobacco have decreased considerably.
2.10      Consumer prices for the processed food crops have been kept low
relative both to general price increases and to the rising costs of handling
and processing them. Although in real terms the retail prices of sembe, rice
and wheat flour were increased considerably between 1973 and 1975, they
declined again in real terms, so that by 1979 they had increased very little
since 1973 (Table 4). While consumers, mostly in urban areas, have benefited
from these prices, the margins between the producer and consumer prices have
been insufficient to cover NMC's costs, and NMC has consequently been incurring
losses on the milled food crops it sells.

2.11       The Government follows a policy of uniform prices known as panter-
ritorial pricing, where prices do not reflect costs of transport. While
having some impact on equalizing incomes, the policy has also placed a finan-
cial strain on parastatals, particularly on NMC. Producers in remote areas,
who would receive a lower price if transport costs were deducted from the
producer price, find it more profitable to produce and sell to NMC (than they
would if they were offered the lower price), and similarly, consumers in
distant areas do not pay the full cost of transport; the situation is the
reverse in the nearby areas. This encourages relatively greater NMC purchases
and sales in distant areas where transport costs are higher and discourages
those in nearby areas, thus raising overall costs of transport.
2.12       Tanzania's annual agricultural pricing policy reviews are carried
out by the Marketing Development Bureau (MDB) in the Ministry of Agriculture
which also advises the Economic Committee of the Cabinet. It was established
in 1970, but since 1975 MDB has been strengthened by provision of technical
assistance by FAO. Its price analysis has been improving to take account of
the complex considerations that enter such analysis, including the changing
world market situation, domestic producer incentives and equity. 1/ Analysis
has not, however, included the likely levels of procurement and costs of the
pricing policies in terms of their budgetary implications. Up to now it has
been mainly NMC, and to some extent other parastatals, that have borne the
costs by operating at a deficit and making use of bank overdraft facilities.
This system has served to mask temporarily the real costs of the pricing
policies. It is clear, however, that Tanzania cannot continue to finance
these policies through use of the banking system, and the impact on NMC should
be eliminated in the next few years by a combination of policy changes and
direct subsidies by Treasury. The Project would strengthen the mechanism of
the Annual Price Review by including an analysis of the likely financial
implications to NMC and to Government of various price recommendations. MDB
is capable of carrying out such analysis. Through a Financial Action Program
(paras 6.04-6.14), the Project would aim to eliminate the costs to NMC of
pricing policies.
E. Previous IDA Experience
2.13      Most of the Bank and IDA financed projects in Tanzania have dealt
with parastatals in Tanzania 2/, and successful implementation of these
projects has been hampered by parastatal inefficiency. This lesson of past
and ongoing projects has been incorporated into the proposed Project. The
1/   MDB is now financed by IDA under the National Maize Project (Cr. 606-TA).
The Project Preparation and Monitoring Bureau (PPMB), established in
Kilimo in 1978 to prepare and monitor projects, is also financed under
NMP. Funds are included in this project to provide them continuing
support for a five-year period.

III. THE NATIONAL MILLING CORPORATION
A. Background
3.01      The National Milling Corporation (NMC), the principal entity for
implementing the Project, was established in 1968 under the National
Milling Corporation Act as manufacturers and processors of agricultural
products. In 1975, these functions were expanded, through enactment of a
revised National Milling Corporation Act, to include purchase, procurement,
transportation and storage of all general grains and staples offered for sale
by farmers and other parastatals. 1/ This expansion of NMC's mandate occurred
at the same time as drought and crop failures (1974 and 1975), so that NMC
became involved in distributing large quantities of imported grain on an
emergency basis. With the abolition of all primary cooperatives in May 1976
(para 1.05), NMC became responsible for direct procurement from villages.
Since 1976, NEC has had to procure increasing quantities of food crops
domestically. While NMC has coped with these difficulties reasonably well,
its organization, staff, technical background, managerial capabilities, and
physical facilities have not been adequate to deal efficiently with expansion
of both responsibility and logistical problems. As a first phase of a long-
term development program, this Project would upgrade NMC to carry out its
mandate more effectively.
B.  Organization, Management and Staffing
3.02      NMC comes under the direction of the Ministry of Agriculture (Kilimo).
It is headed by a Board of Directors, appointed by the Minister of Agriculture.
The Board is chaired by the Executive Chairman, but responsibility for the
day to day operations of NMC rests with the General Manager, a Presidential
appointee.
3.03      Within the past year, NMC has improved its organizational structure
(to that shown in Chart C-1), on the basis of recommendations made by the
Standing Committee on Parastatal Organizations (SCOPO) and IDA. It is now
organized at headquarters along functional lines into eight departments:
Planning, Internal Audit, Manpower Development and Administration, Procurement
and Storage, Transport, Production and Sales, Finance and Maintenance.
3.04      Outside headquarters NMC operates through 24 branch offices; one
for each of the 20 regions and four others in Dar es Salaam, each headed by
a branch manager, who report directly to the General Manager. Each branch
is organized into six sections, responsible for Administration, Accounts,
1/  This increased role of NMC resulted from the dissolution of the National
Agricultural Products Board (NAPB). NMC and other parastatals took over
the assets and liabilities of the relevant components of NAPB.



- 11 -
Procurement and Sales, Storage and Transport, Quality and Pest Cotrol and,
where applicable, Milling or Processing. For certain functions (i.e. internal
audit), NMC is organized into six geographic zones, each covering several
branches.
3.05      At the end of 1978, NMC employed 4,200 people, of which about
400 were at headquarters, 1,200 in the Dar-es-Salaam branches, and 2,600 at
other branches. The corporation is hampered by lack of qualified specialist
staff (storage, transport, engineering, planning, finance), and this is most
apparent in the storage and accounting practices (paras. 3.07-3.09; 3.17). 1/
While there are a number of vacancies at the highest levels, NNC is over-
staffed at non-professional levels (it may be over-employing as many as 600
people in the branch storage facilities).
3.06      NMC organization and management practices have a number of inter-
related problems. A large number of people report directly to the General
Manager, and there is insufficient delegation of responsibility and communi-
cation among the departments and branches. Effective control or planning is
difficult because there is inadequate use of available information, and
financial monitoring and control is weak. NMC has made progress through
the recent reorganization and this Project would address some of these
problems further through provision of technical assistance, establishment of a
management information system, introduction of systematic planning, and a
training program. The problem of too-wide a span of control remains, however,
and will have to be addressed over time.
C.   Storage Practices and Facilities
3.07      Procurement.  NHC has recently procured 400-500,000 mt of crops each
year.  Crops are purchased from farmers by the Village Council on behalf of
NMC, and held until NMC can procure them.  In principle, payment is made
immediately upon purchase, except when there are insufficient operating funds.
Villages often lack weighing facilities, quality control capability and
godowns. This is compounded by problems of communication and transportation
(para 1.08) and, as a result, the crops handed over to NMC are often of
uncertain quantity and poor quality. 2/ In principle, a weighing procedure
and a grading system should be followed at the district godown, which could
verify the crop amounts and quality delivered from the villages. In practice,
however, weighbridges and moisture meters are out of order and virtually all
purchases are classified at the same (high) grade; seldom does NMC withhold
payment from the villages because of weight or quality loss on crops delivered.
This Project would establish quality control and fumigation teams at all NMC
branches to provide assistance and information to villages on proper methods
of grain handling, and would provide equipment and training at all NMC branch
depots to enable NMC to weigh and grade the crops properly. Until the demand
for village stores can be evaluated (para. 1.04), no further provision is made
in this Project.
1/   The number of trained and experienced specialist staff is probably about
25-30 individuals, low for an organization as large and complex as NMC.
2/   At the time of crop collection by NMC, the moisture content is probably
high (16-18%), and infestation of the crop has begun.



- 12 -
3.08      Transport.  NMC needs more vehicles, for procurement and transport
of personnel, fumigation teams and mobile workshops. In addition, NMC needs
to plan its procurement and storage patterns to minimize combined transport
and storage costs. The Project would provide increased transport facilities
and would strengthen the Transport Department through improving staffing,
training and planning procedures. The problem of poor roads (para 1.08)
will, however, continue to create difficulties in some areas.
3.09      Grain Storage and Quality Control.  The management of grain storage
is poor, with limited fumigation, improper ventilation, stacking and spacing,
and little effort to remove damaged or infested grain. District and some
regional godowns remain partially empty, while crops are transferred to
terminal storage points, where they must be stored outdoors. A number of
estimates of crop storage losses have been made by storage specialists, and
they vary widely, i.e., between 5 and 55% per annum, depending on the crop,
geographical location, condition of purchase, and storage conditions. In the
last three years, purchases have increased substantially, creating especially
difficult grading, logistic and storage management problems for NMC. Estimates
by the appraisal team, after field visits to about 60% of NMC's storage,
placed losses at about 25-35% per year in godowns, and for open storage, at
40-50% per year. Under the Project, a baseline survey would be carried out to
establish these estimates more precisely. Technical assistance would be
provided for improvement of grain storage practices both in closed storage
facilities and in the open (para. 4.19).
3.10      Planning.  Planning for procurement is difficult because of wide
year-to-year fluctuations and because of changes in the pattern of procure-
ment. Nevertheless, as noted above (para 3.06), planning capability is weak
and would be strengthened under the Project through technical assistance,
incremental staff and establishment of a management information system.
3.11      Facilities.  Some of the existing storage, including silos and
godowns- both owned and hired by NMC, are in poor condition. Many have
inadequate or no access roads, broken doors and windows, inadequate drainage,
defective weigh bridges, leaky roofs, poor lighting, inadequate fire alarm
systems and defective fire extinguishers, no appropriate ventilation system,
and damaged walls and floors. Even with proper crop handling, storage under
such conditions involves substantial losses from dampness and insects.
Storage capacity is insufficient to meet present requirements. Although on a
country-wide basis existing storage capacity, including silos and hired
godowns, is adequate for macro requirements, a regional analysis shows a
shortage in some areas and a surplus capacity in others (Table 5). The
shortages will increase with the growth in domestic demand for food crops,
leading to increasing quantities stored in the open. 1/ The Project provide
for rehabilitation of existing facilities (paras. 4.04 and 4.05), construction
of new storage facilities, (para. 4.06 and 4.07) and would upgrade crop
storage in the open (4.08).
I/  NiMC will soon have have use of about 60 transit sheds throughout the
country, of 1,000 MT storage capacity each, provided by bilateral
donors. Although not suitable for storage of any duration, they can
be used for short term (3-6 weeks) storage.

1982/83 because the investment proposed under this Project would
meet needs up to this year; a second phase with additional investment
would foll,w.
29/   In addition to this total, NMC stored about 250,000 mt in the open in
1978/79.
3/   Includes bag stores hired, which in Dar-es-Salaam, Morogoro, Arusha
and Kilimanjaro account for 40-60% of the storage, and storage under
construction as of 1979, and excludes storage being provided under SGR
(para. 3.12), as the SGR is not intended for seasonal storage.
4/   These estimates are based on assumptions about procurement, import and
consumption levels as found in Table T-1, and on assumptions about
storage of crops in region of procurement, milling, or consumption. In

these figures. Storage needs estimated for maize, wheat, paddy, rice,
and small amounts of minor crops only.

3.12      Strategic Reserves.  Bilateral donors have agreed to build 70,000
tons of storage capacity for strategic grain reserve, and Government is
seeking assistance for an additional 30,000 tons. NMC will be responsible for
managing this grain reserve, which, without help from Government, will further
strain its overburdened financial position. One objective of the Financial
Action Program (paras. 6.04-6.14) is to have NMC establish and maintain
separate accounts for the SGR and Government pay the costs of operating the
SGR.
D.   Milling Facilites and Practices
3.13      Facilities.  NMC's milling capacity for maize, paddy and wheat is
in Table 6. For maize, if the use of hammer mills is included, the nominal
capacity output of 189,000 mt/year should be sufficient to cover NMC's
requirements through 1982/83. 1/ In fact, however, NMC's hammer mills are not
reliable, breakdowns are frequent, the extraction rate cannot be controlled,
and the quality is therefore not high. The capacity of its roller mills alone
is not sufficient to cover current demand for maize flour (sembe) and NMC has
contracted custom mills. These latter are, however, not expected to provide a
viable alternative in the future (para 2.06), while demand for milling capacity
will exceed existing capacity by about 27,000 mt in 1982/83 (para 4.11). The
capacity of wheat milling is 127,000 mt/year, sufficient until 1982/83. NMC's
rice milling capacity of 132,000 mt/year, on the other hand, is more than
necessary because over half of the domestically procured rice sold by NMC has
already been milled at the time of purchase by NMC, and imports are also of
rice (rather than paddy).
3.14      Capacity Utilization.  The average capacity utilization for 1976/77
was about 76% for all maize roller mills, which was due to the low utilization
rates outside Dar es Salaam, and about 40% for hammer mills. For wheat it was
79%, and for rice only 25%. Capacity utilization rates for maize could be
increased by better planning of maintenance and repairs. For rice, there is
excess capacity which could be utilized profitably only if domestic produc-
tion increases significantly.
3.15      Extraction Rates and Quality Control.  Maize is currently milled at
an average extraction rate of 89%. If the rate were reduced to 85%, all the
bran and part of the germ would be removed, thus reducing the fat content and
increasing the shelf life of the sembe. Quality control of maize grain and flour
(sembe) is limited, and, as a result, NMC's reputation for its sembe has suf-
fered. For wheat, the extraction rate averages 75% and the quality of the
flour is generally good. Paddy is milled at about 65% extraction, and al-
though there is little qual:ity control for moisture and there are resultant
high percentages of broken grain (10-30%), the quality of the rice appears
to be acceptable to consumers.
3.16      As in the case of crop procurement and storage, the capacity of NMC
to manage its milling activities is limited, because of a lack of trained or
experienced staff and an absence of a systematic data system to provide the
necessary information. The Project would provide technical assistance (para.
4.19), rehabilitation and expansion of existing maize milling facilities
(paras. 4.11 - 4.12), and establishment of a management information system
(para. 5.08) to identify the causes of low extraction rates and poor milling
quality.

F. Financial Situation
3.17      Nature of Financial Information Available.  NMC's accounts are
insufficient in detail and accuracy to have a precise picture of NMC's financial
situation. The auditors have had problems in reconciling NMC's accounts for a
number of reasons: records of stocks and their interbranch transfers are
inadequate; the schedule of fixed assets are inaccurate and incomplete; debtor
balances do not reconcile with NMC's records. In addition, in FY1974 and
1975, NMC sold imported grains (for famine relief) at a loss and was reimbursed
by Treasury, but in the absence of supporting documents of physical stock
figures, the amounts recovered from Treasury did not necessarily reflect the
costs incurred.
3.18      Financial Situation.  The general picture of NMC's financial situa-
tion (Annex 1, Tables T-2, T-3) shows that it has deteriorated to an unten-
able level, with increasing annual losses and reliance on overdraft facilities
from the National Bank of Commerce (NBC) to finance operating costs. As of
November 30, 1978, NMC had an overdraft of approximately Tsh 1.8 billion
(US$217 million), backed primarily by NMC's inventory, valued at the cost of
procurement, handling and storage. The quality of this inventory is ques-
tionable, however, as the valuation does not take into account deterioration
of crops, which are estimated to be considerable (para 3.09). In addition,
some of the remaining 'good' stock can be sold only at a much lower price
than its valuation which is based on its cost. The actual market value of
the inventory backing the overdraft has been estimated after examination of
the crops at least Tsh 500 million less than its book value. Correcting NMC's
capital structure would involve doing a proper valuation of NMC's inventory and
writing off the resulting bad debt (para 6.05).
3.19      Sources of losses incurred by NMC include both Government policies
and NMC's own inefficiencies. NMC has little financial autonomy, since
farm gate prices of all crops and consumer prices are fixed by Government
such that NMC margins are insufficient to cover its costs. NMC's mandate
has included purchasing, transporting and storing drought-resistant crops
(cassava, sorghum, and millets) for which there is little domestic demand from
official channels, and for which export prices are considerably below their
estimated costs. In addition, NMC's high operating costs come from a com-
bination of factors, although because of the state of the accounts, it is
difficult to identify how much costs could be reduced by improving management.
These factors include high storage losses, low milling utilization rates,
overstaffing, high transport costs, 1/ and interest charges on the bank over-
draft, which amounted in FY1978 to about 60% of total overhead expenses. 2/
3.20      Projections.  Without improvement in efficiency and in margins
between producer and consumer prices, and if NMC is required to purchase
large quantities of crops it cannot sell domestically, NMC would incur heavy
annual losses in the future (para. 6.01). Although the Project would
identify sources of high costs and recommend changes in operations to
reduce inefficiencies (para. 6.07), any significant impact would be realized
only over a number of years. In spite of the expected decrease in unit
1/   Partly the result of panterritorial pricing.
2/   It is estimated that unit variable costs could be reduced by roughly
15-22% with improved efficiency (Annex 1, Tables T-4 - T-6.)



- 17 -
costs as a result of this, however, projections show that by 1985/86, for
sales of domestic and imported maize (sembe), wheat flour and rice, annual
losses before fixed costs and interest on bank overdraft would be on the order
of Tsh 173 million (US$20 million). 1/ For other crops (sorghum, cassava and
millets), if purchases remain at their 1978/79 levels, the annual losses
incurred would be at least Tsh 130 million (US$15 million). 2/ Other activities,
including fruit canning and animal feeds, would involve additional losses of
about Tsh 85 million (US$10 million) (Annex 1, Table T-9.) 3/
3.21      Losses of such magnitude cannot be sustained by Tanzania, either
by direct subsidy provided by Treasury or indirectly through bank overdrafts.
It is expected, therefore, that some of the pricing and/or procurement poli-
cies affecting NMC will be changed. The Project would assist by strengthening
the mechanism of annual price reviews carried out by MDB, to include analysis
to present to policy makers on the costs of policy options (para. 6.09). At
the same time, in order for NMC to operate on the principles of a commercial
entity, the Project proposes that Government reimburse NMC for losses incurred
by NMC as a result of Government policies (para. 6.11). The Project also
proposes the establishment of an appropriate capital structure for NMC
(para. 6.05).
3.22      The Project would provide technical assistance staffing (para.
4.19), and training (para. 4.17) to upgrade NMC's financial department, and
would establish a management information system to improve financial management
and planning (para. 5.08).
IV. THE PROJECT
A. Background of the Project
4.01      The need for additional milling and crop storage facilities was
recognized in 1975 at the time of appraisal of the IDA-financed National
Maize Project (NMP) (Credit 606-TA). Accordingly, NMP provided financing for
construction of about 500 village stores, about 80,000 mt of storage for the
National Milling Corporation, and a preparation study for future investment in
storage and milling to.meet requirements up to 1985. The study was carried
out by Coopers and Lybrand Association, Ltd., and in July 1977 a proposal
was submitted for a six-year investment program of US$90 million, whose major
components were construction of a strategic grain reserve of 100,000 mt
(para. 3.12), seasonal storage capacity of about 225,000 mt, of which two-
thirds was to be open storage, renovation and expansion of maize and wheat
milling capacity by 460,000 tons, transport and training facilities. IDA
discussed these proposals extensively with Government and raised a number of
issues, such as pricing policies, NMC's purchasing mandate, foodcrop export
policies, NMC's finances and viability, the need for long-term institutional
1/   Figures in constant 1979/80 terms.
2/   If the cassava, sorghum and millets cannot be exported, the losses
would be much higher.
3/   This analysis was done before the January 1980 change in prices for
Sembe, wheat flour and rice, which would result in a different financial
picture. See Annex 1, Table T-9, footnote 3 for discussion.



- 18 -
development of NMC, and projected levels of crop production and their implica-
tions for investment in facilities. IDA then prepared a report in September
1978 that emphasized the interaction   of policies with NMC's finances and the
need for institution building. The scale of the proposed Project was smaller,
with about 120,000 tons of storage capacity, half to be controlled-open
storage, restoration and expansion of maize and wheat mills by 156,000 mt,
over a six-year period of investment of US$38 million. Government had found
bilateral donors for the SGR.
4.02      The Government and IDA have had a long-standing dialogue on the
issues surrounding NMC, including those of policy and institution-building;
IDA has provided substantial input in the preparation and discussions on the
proposed development of NMC. Government and NMC have made efforts to change
NMC's working environment, including: recognizing NMC's financial problems,
exporting excess crops, reorganization of NMC and improvements in staffing.
These have been promising measures. Nevertheless, during appraisal (January
1979), it became clear that under existing policies NMC could not expect to be
a viable commercial entity nor could the Tanzanian economy continue to support
the costs of these policies. At the same time that politically difficult
decisions were and are required (para. 6.10) and will take time to implement,
NMC is in urgent need of rehabilitation and expansion of existing facilities,
as well as technical assistance and training. The strategy of the proposed
Project would be to provide limited investment to meet NMC's immediate needs,
to correct NMC's financial position and to clarify the costs to NMC and to
Government of policies affecting the foodcrop sector. This would be the first
phase of a long-term development program, and would establish the foundation
for expansion of NMC's operations. The project would involve investment in
NMC facilities, provision of technical assistance and training, and implemen-
tation of a Financial Action Program to correct NMC's capital structure and
reduce its annual losses resulting from policies, which should lead to
appropriate changes in policies (paras. 6.04 - 6.14). A second phase of
investment in facilities would be scheduled for 1983 to follow on the
investment in this Project, and overlap with the technical assistance and
training provided for five years. Financing for the second phase would depend
on progress in implementing the Financial Action Program.
B.   General Description
4.03      Within the context of a proposed Financial Action Program (para.
4.02), the objectives of this first phase would be to increase NMC's effi-
ciency, eliminate NMC's losses through government subsidies and changes in
prices and purchase policy, and strengthen the government agriculture policy-
making mechanism. The Project investment would improve management practices
and strengthen the institutional capacity of NMC to procure, transport, store
and mill foodcrops. Specifically, the Project provides for:
(a) rehabilitation of 40% of existing NMC godowns and all
existing silos, involving about 135,000 metric tons of
storage capacity;
(b)  construction of storage capacity, to equal 13,000 m 2, or
about 20-25,000 mt, in Dar-es-Salaai, Mtwara and Dodoma
Regions, and an additional 13,000 m , or about 20-25,000 mt
in as yet unspecified locations;



- 19 -
(c) tarpaulins and polythene sheets for existing open storage;
(d) implementation of pilot programs for controlled open-storage
and dryers;
(e) expansion of maize milling capacity by extension of the
mill in Dar-es-Salaam by 70 tons/day and construction of
a new mill at Dodoma with a capacity of 120 tons/day;
(f) rehabilitation of existing mills;
(g) central laboratory and satellites for grain and flour analysis;
(h) about 55 lorries for transport of grain, for fumigation teams
and for mobile workshops; radio communication network;
about 88 utility vehicles and passenger cars and about 45
motorcycles;
(i) training for NMC staff at all levels;
(j) technical assistance and staffing, and consultants' services
to NMC to improve management, information systems and planning;
(k) financing for the Marketing Development Bureau (MDB) and the
Project Preparation and Monitoring Bureau (PPMB) for staff,
vehicles, equipment, surveys and analytic work.
The Project with the exception of part (k), would be implemented by NMC, with
input from MDB and PPMB for certain features. Part (k) would be carried out
by Kilimo.
C. Detailed Features
Rehabilitation of Storage Facilities
4.04      About a fifth of the existing NMC godowns need major repairs and
improvement and a further fifth need minor repairs and improvement and all of
NMC's silos need repair or improvement. Such investment would provide
Tanzania with the most economic means of increasing storage capacity. The
Project, therefore, includes the drawing up of a detailed program of
rehabilitation and its subsequent implementation.
4.05      NMC's proposed supervising engineer (para. 4.19), in conjunction with
consultants to be hired on contract, would review existing facilities and draw
up the detailed program of rehabilitation. Any rehabilitation with an esti-
mated cost above US$100,000 proposed for one godown would be subject to
economic analysis to assure that for each godown to be rehabilitated: (a) the
net present value of the rehabilitation would be greater than zero (at a
discount rate of 10%) and (b) the net present value of rehabilitation would
be greater than that of replacement of the godown. To facilitate bulking
procurement of both equipment and civil works, the complete detailed program,
with the analysis indicated above, will be submitted to IDA for comment no



- 20 -
later than December 31, 1980 for approval prior to tendering. 1/ Assurances to
this effect were obtained during negotiations.
New Storage Facilities
4.06      Without investment in new storage facilities from this Project,
NMC would have about 311,000 mt of seasonal storage capacity (Table 5), and
the rehabilitation component of the Project would ensure that this capacity
is effective. Looking at global requirements for storage of maize, paddy,
rice, wheat, and minor quantities of other crops, this capacity should be
sufficient up to 1982/83. A regional analysis, based on storage needs for
these crops, shows, however, that NMC needs additional storage in specific2
areas (Table 5). The project makes provision for construction of 26,000 m
(40-50,000 mt), which would meet the need up to 1982/83; a second phase of
storage construction would follow this (para 4.02). 2/ The decision to invest
in closed flat storage was based on economic analysis of the alternative
investment possibilities. The new facilities would include civil works
(including, inter alia, access roads, drainage and drying platforms), and
equipment (including, inter alia, weighbridges, lighting, exhaust fans, fire
alarm system and fire extinguishers).
4.07      A part of the funds for new storage would be used to construct
storage in Ireas with the largest and most clearly identified shortages:
(i) 7,800 m  in Dar-es-Salaam Region, a! a major consumption center and port
of entry for imports; (ii) some 2,600 m in Mtwara Region to replace exist-
ing facilities no longer useable or capable of economic rehabilitation; and
(iii) some 2,600 m in Dodoma Region, a major procurement area. Detailed
designs for this storage would be prepared by consultants financed out of
the PPF, under the guidance of the supervising engineer, and submitted to IDA
for approval no later than December 31, 1980. Assurances to this effect were
obtained during negotiations. The remeining funds would become available for
storage construction of about 13,000 m (20-25,000 mt), on the condition that
NMC submit a master plan satisfactory to IDA, showing financial, economic and
technical viability of each additional store. Assurances to this effect were
obtained during negotiations. Funds for the design work have been provided
under PPF.
Tarpaulins and Sheets for Open Storage
4.08      In 1978/79, NMC stored about 250,000 mt of foodcrops in the open.
NMC will continue to store foodcrops in the open because procurement patterns
often vary widely and unpredictably from year to year. In addition, NMC will
1/   Funds have been provided under the Project Preparation Facility (PPF) for
preparation of the rehabilitation program.
2/   Storage needs estimated for maize, wheat, paddy, rice, and small amounts
of minor crops only. Storage requirements for cassava, millets, sorghums,
and other crops not included. See Table 5 in text and Table T-1 in Annex.



- 21 -
continue in the near future to purchase cassava, sorghum and millets, until
Government pricing, procurement and sales policies are changed, and these
crops will also require storage. The tarpaulins currently used in open
storage need to be replaced, 1/ and in addition to provision of technical
assistance to improve open storage practices (para 4.19), the Project would
provide for replacement of the tarpaulins through 1982/83, sufficient
for about 100,000 mt of open storage.
Pilot Programs
4.09      Controlled Open Storage.  Technical opinions vary on the efficiency
of controlled open storage, in terms of management requirements and the
savings in crop losses. A pilot program would be carried out in three
locations to evaluate an improved technology for controlled open storage under
different climatic conditions and on different crops. This would involve
constructing a cement plynth with appropriate access road and drainage, at
Dodoma for about 250 mt of sorghum and millet and at Babati for about 250 mt
of maize, and making use of the existing cement plynth at Arusha for about
500 mt of maize and wheat. This pilot program would be carried out within the
context of regular storage operations at the respective branches, with moni-
toring and evaluation carried out by NMC's Planning Department.
4.10      Dryers.  To test the effect of mechanical drying on storage losses,
three dryers each with a capacity of 5 tons/hour would be located at three
different branches and/or district godowns and would be operated under closely
controlled conditions.
Maize Mill Construction
4.11      Existing maize milling capacity is shown in Table 6 and milling
problems are described in paras. 3.13-3.16. By 1982/83, demand projections
show an incremental requirement for milling capacity of 27,000 mt over and
above existing capacity (Table 7). Private millers would be unable to meet
this demand. Apart from technical assistance in milling (para. 4.20), the
Project would provide for the construction of new maize milling capacity, and
the rehabilitation of existing mills, so that NMC can meet the projected
demand for maize flour (sembe). This investment is in keeping with the
Government policy to promote milling in the public sector (para. 3.13), and
particularly for urban areas there is an important role for NMC to play in
meeting demand for milled products. Specifically, the project provides for
the extension of the maize mill in Dar-es-Salaam from its current 50 mt/day to
120 mt/day (space is available at the existing site for additional rollers),
and the construction of a new mill of 120 mt/day at Dodoma. This additional
capacity of 190 mt/day is equivalent to 57,000 mt/year, assuming operations
during 300 days/year. Added to the existing capacity, this should be sufficient
to meet demand projected for 1982/83 (Table 7), provided NMC can raise its
capacity utilization from 75-80% to something over 80%. 2/ It is anticipated
1/   Tarpaulins normally last 2-3 years when used in open storage.  Purchase
of some tarpaulins were provided under the PPF.
2/   This capacity is an optimal level and assumes operation of mills 6
days/week, 52 weeks/year. If capacity utilization cannot be raised to
over 80% of this figure, NMC will continue to resort to its hammer
mills or private contractors.



- 22 -
that by improvement in mill management, capacity utlization can be raised to
90%, thus providing some excess capacity by 1982/83. Although the Dodoma mill
would not be fully utilized during its first years of operation, the proposed
investment would take advantage of the economies of scale in investment in new
maize mills. Funds for the design work have been provided under the PPF.

44,000 mt capacity if they could be operated at full capacity;
however, in practice they are frequently out of order.
Rehabilitation of Mills
4.12      The Project would provide funds for rehabilitation of existing
mills including those in Iringa, Arusha and Dar Es Salaam, to consist mainly
of replacement of parts and, where necessary, of the roller mill, plus provi-
sion of additional facilities and equipment for a small laboratory to be
established at each maize mill for routine analysis of grain and flour. In
order to facilitate bulking equipment in the event that it would be appro-
priate, assurances were obtained during negotiations that the detailed
rehabilitation program would be drawn up by consultants satisfactory to the
Association, and would be submitted to IDA for approval by December 31, 1980.
Funds for the detailed preparation have been provided under the PPF.
Central Laboratory
4.13      A central laboratory would be constructed at NMC's Pugu Road maize
mill site in Dar-es-Salaam for analysis of grain and flour for nearby branches.
For outlying branches, smaller satellite laboratories would be set up at four
other locations (Iringa, Dodoma, Mwanza and Arusha), including civil works and
equipment, e.g., lab scale, moisture testers, ash furnace, and other necessary
apparatus.



- 23 -
Transport
4.14      Trucks.  To supplement NMC's current trucking fleet of just c;-ver '60
trucks and to meet year round baseload transport requirements, the Proj_:_ct would
provide an additional 46 4-7 ton trucks for procurement of crops from villages
to depots, and from depots to branch godowns. These additions would permit
NMC to cover its baseload requirements plus about 25-30% of peak procurement
requirements. NMC would rely for the rest of its transport requirements on
private transporters and, in those regions covered by IDA-assisted Trucking
Industry Rehabilitation and Improvement Project (Credit 743-TA), on public
sector trucking companies. 11 In addition, a number of special purpose
lorries would be provided; four 4-7 ton trucks to be used as fumigation
vehicles, which added to NMC's trucks already used for this purpose would
provide one such truck for each zone; one 10-12 ton wrecker and six 4-7 ton
trucks to be used as mobile workshops (one for each zone), which would supple-
ment the other equipment and facilities being provided for NMC's trucking
maintenance by BADEA under NMP. Provision would be made for spare parts for
these vehicles. There would also be provision for a communication network of
two-way radios for the trucks.
4.15      Passenger Transport.  NMC's transport facilities are particularly
limited for NMC personnel at the branch and depot levels. There are currently
about 70 cars and utility vehicles in NMC's possession, with a concentration
of them at headquarters in Dar-es-Salaam. The Project would provide 56
four-wheel drive vehicles and 34 passenger cars. This would bring the average
number per branch to five and two, respectively, for use by the branch manager,
procurement officers, and depot managers; each mobile training team (para
4.17) would have use of a four-wheel drive vehicle; in addition, 8 of the
four-wheel drive vehicles would be allocated specifically as follows:
one each for use by the Planning and Management Advisor, the Senior Storage
Advisor, the Training Advisor, and the Transport Manager, to be hired as
technical assistance and staff under the Project (para 4.19); one to be used
by the Planning Manager; one to be used by the Silo Specialist and Fumigation
and Quality Control Specialist; one by the supervising and maintenance engineers;
and one for use by the Chief Accountant and staff accountants, (para 4.19).
The provision of 45 motorcycles would allow for use of two per branch by
quality control teams. Provision would be made for spare parts for these
vehicles. To help assist in adequate maintenance of these motorcycles,
agreement was reached at negotiations that these will be sold to NMC staff on
credit, with adjustment for mileage allowances.
Training
4.16      NMC needs to develop an in-service training system capable of iden-
tifying and meeting the training needs of its staff. The objective of the
training program would be to upgrade NMC staff at all levels in all operations;
this would include staff at headquarters, at branch offices and at depots
involved in technical, administrative and financial operations, as well as
management.
1/   The Regions covered under that project are Mwanza, Tabora, Mtwara, Dodoma
and Ruvuma.



- 24 -
4.17      The Training Advisor to be employed under the Project (para. 4.19),
in conjunction with NMC's manpower development and training manager, would
train a core training staff at NMC, consisting of NMC's manpower development
officer and training officer. This core staff of two people, in conjunction
with the Training Advisor and the manpower development and training manager,
would focus as a priority on storage practices, with later phases in other
activities including, inter alia, milling, transport maintenance, accounting,
budgeting and management. The program would consist of in-service training
wherever possible and practical, through use of mobile two-person teams who
would train NMC staff in the branch offices. This in-service training would
be supplemented by local causes at various institutes in Tanzania. For
certain specialized courses not available in Tanzania, e.g., milling technology,
funds would be provided for overseas courses. NMC staff at various levels
would make use of overseas visits to other milling marketing organizations.
4.18      The costs of the training component have been based on a preliminary
program drawn up at the time of appraisal, and include staffing, transport
facilities for the mobile teams, training facilities and equipment such
as films and manuals for headquarters and for depots, as well as expenses
incurred for external financing, including local and overseas courses and
visits. The PPF would be used to employ the Training Advisor, and assurances
were obtained at negotiations that a more specific training program would
be drawn up and submitted to IDA by April 30, 1981.
Technical Assistance, Staffing, and Consultants
4.19      Additional staffing is required in NMC to fill positions created by
the reorganization, to strengthen NMC's management and to provide technical
expertise in specific areas, where such expertise is particularly important
both for NMC's day to day operations and for Project implementation. Accord-
ingly, the Project would include provision for employment of the following
positions, on terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA:
(a) Senior Storage and Grain Handling Advisor, to assist
in establishing operational procedures, policies and
criteria for appropriate grain handling practices;
(b)  Silo Specialist, to assist in implementing and supervising
storage operations in NMC's silos and in the designs for
rehabilitation of silos (para. 4.04);
(c) Fumigation and Quality Control Specialist, to assist in
improving the grain handling procedures that affect
quality including drying procedures and supervision of
quality control teams, both in storage and at mills;
(d) Planning and Management Advisor, to advise the Planning
Department in its major activities of producing NMC's
procurement plan (para 6.11), establishing and making use
of the management information system (para 5.09), and
monitoring the cost effectiveness of NMC's operations;
(e) Chief Accountant, to assist NMC's Financial Manager to
establish an accounting system to permit effective
financial control and to keep NMC's accounts up to date;



- 25 -
(f) Training Advisor, to assist NMC's manpower development
and training officer to establish an in-service training
system (para. 4.17).
(g) Supervising Engineer, who would be responsible for reviewing
all designs and contracts for new construction and
rehabilitation, and for supervising these activities;
(h) Maintenance Engineer, who would be responsible for establishing
and supervising building maintenance schedules and implemen-
tation;
(i) Transport Manager, who would be responsible for operating
and maintaining NMC's transport fleet;
(j) Cost Accountant, who would be responsible for implementing
an adequate accounting system;
(k) Five Staff Accountants, one for each zone outside
of Dar-es-Salaam, who would be responsible for the
accounts for each branch within his/her zone.
The first six positions above (a-f) call for highly specialized skills and
experience; in the event that suitable candidates cannot be identified in
Tanzania, funds would be provided for international recruitment. The aver-
age man month cost including salary, benefits, international travel and
subsistence, would be about TSh 55,000 (US$6,600). The total cost for these
six positions over a five-year period would be TSh 24.5 million (US$3.0
million) and includes housing, office equipment and other minor items, which
are listed separately in the cost table. For the remaining positions (g-k),
experience has shown that staff can probably be recruited in Tanzania, and
the funds provided are at average man month cost of Tsh 5,800 (US$700). The
total cost of these positions is about TSh 3.7 (US$.4 million). Additional
office space would be provided for all the additional staff (a-k). Detailed
terms of reference for these positions have been prepared and agreed between
NMC and IDA. With PPF funds, international recruitment for the first six
positions has begun under Agricultural Development Services (ADS). Assurances
were obtained that NMC would employ qualified and experienced candidates
on terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA, and that the experts and staff
would be appointed by October 31, 1980.
4.20      Short-term Consultants.  In order to provide technical assistance
for specific matters on a short-term basis, funds have been provided so that
NMC could employ consultants as necessary. These would include, inter alia, a
milling technologist, 1/ a workshop maintenance engineer, and a management
information specialist. The average man month cost, based on individual fees,
international travel and subsistence would be about TSh 63,000 (US$7,500), and
the total cost of providing short term consultants would be TSh 1.9 million
(US$225,000).
1/   The milling technologist would recommend, if appropriate, a longer-term
milling advisor who would be financed by the Project.



Marketing Development Bureau and the Project Preparation and Monitoring
4.21      MDB carries out annual agricultural price reviews and PPMB prepares
and supervises projects from Kilimo (para 2.12), and in this Project, both MDB
and PPMB are expected to play a critical role, the former through the Price
Policy Review and the implementation of the Financial Action Program (para.
6.09), and the latter, with NMC's Planning Division, in the monitoring and
evaluation of this Project (para. 5.10). Support is now provided under NMP
(Cr. 606-TA) to these two agencies up through June 1980. Funds are, therefore,
provided under this Project for the ongoing requirements of MDB and PPMB for
international staffing, vehicles, operating costs, surveys, studies and
analysis as well as for additional analysis under this Project (for MDB, see
para 6.09; for PPMB, paras 5.10-5.13), and a small office building for PPMB
staff. Functions and terms of reference of MDB and PPMB were discussed
and assurance obtained at negotiations that the work program and staffing
levels of PPMB and MDB would be reviewed by IDA on an annual basis. At the
end of the current contract with UNDP/FAO to provide technical assistance
(December 1981 for MDB and December 1982 for PPMB), the level of staffing,
including the required technical assistance, would be reviewed to ensure that
staffing would be adequate to carry out their functions.
D. Project Costs
4.22      The total cost of the Project would be TSh 484.6 million (US$58.4
million) of which US$36.0 million (62%) represents the foreign exchange
costs. The costs include about Tsh 8.3 million (US$1.0 million) of taxes
on locally procured items. The phasing of Project costs is shown in
Table T-8 and Project costs are summarized below:

- 27 -
Project base costs have been estimated at January 1980 prices. Physical
contingencies of 10% on both specific civil works and equipment have been
included. 1/ Price contingencies have been included on vehicles and equipment
at 10.5% in 1980, 9% in 1981, 8% in 1982, and at 7% thereafter, on staff,
consultants and studies at 8% per annum, and on civil works at 12% in 1980 and
1981 at 11% in 1982 and 10% thereafter.  Price contingencies on civil works
reflect the pressure on construction industry capacity in Tanzania.  Price
contingencies total 18% of Project costs.
E. Financing
4.23       The financing of Project costs net of taxes and duties will be as
follows:
US$ Million          %
IDA                                43.0             75
Government of Tanzania             14.4             25
57.4           100
The proposed IDA credit of US$43.0 million would be on standard terms to
the Government of Tanzania and would cover all the foreign exchange costs of
the Project (US$36.0 million) and US$7.0 million,, or 31%, of local costs, or
about 75% of net Project costs. The Government would provide the remaining
US$14.4 million net of taxes and duties.
4.24      NMC is not now in a financial position to increase its indebtedness
(para 3.18) by borrowing the funds required for the Project; the future finan-
cial situation of NMC depends on pricing policies pursued by Government and it
is unlikely that NMC will accumulate surplus (para 6.02). Funds required by
NMC for the Project would therefore be channelled to it by Government in the
form of equity. During negotiations assurances to this effect were obtained.
4.25      To ensure that storage and milling facilities could be built quickly
the Association provided US$0.9 million through the Project Preparation
Facility (PPF). About 50% of this facility was to be used for payment of
consultant fees so that all design works would be completed by the start of
the Project, and for early recruitment and hiring of technical assistance
personnel and staff. The balance was to be used for emergency purchase of
tarpaulins. The PPF was approved in June 1979 and as at February 29, 1980,
US$121,000 have been disbursed.
1/   Because cost estimates are notional for rehabilitation of stores and
mills, construction of classrooms and classroom and library equipment, no
physical contingencies were included. The total physical contingencies
is therefore considerably less than 10% of total Project cost.

V. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A.   Organization
5.01      The recent reorganization of NMC is a more logical grouping of
functions (Chart C-1 and para. 3.03), and has created several new and impor-
tant units (internal audit and maintenance sections). The Planning Division
has been strengthened by increased staffing, and in addition to the Planning
Manager, will include the Planning and Management Advisor and Supervising
Engineer financed by the Project, and additional economists/statisticians.
The other staff financed by the Project would be part of the appropriate
departments. 1/
B.   Management
5.02      The National Milling Corporation would have responsibility for
implementation of the Project, except for: Implementation of the financial
action program, which would rest with NMC, MDB, and MOF (paras 6.04-6.14),
and Project monitoring, which would rest with PPMB (para. 5.10). Day-to-day
responsibility for the Project would rest with the Planning Manager. The
other advisors under the Project would report to him, who would in turn report
to the General Manager, who would have final decision-making authority. One
of the problems of NMC management has been insufficient communication among
managers (para. 3.06), and it is expected that the recently strengthened
Planning Division will improve coordination of NMC activities. It would be a
condition of disbursement against civil works that the Storage and Planning
Advisors (para. 4.19) be in post, and against the transport component that the
Transport Manager (para. 4.19) be appointed. Assurance was obtained at
negotiations that NMC would ensure prompt employment of all its key staff,
including the Planning Manager.
C.   Implementation Schedule
5.03      All Project investments and financing for technical assistance,
training, MDB and PPMB are provided over a five year period. Charts C-2
and C-3 indicates the anticipated rates of implementation of the various
project components. PPF funds should facilitate early start of implementation
by advancing recruitment of technical assistance and local staff (para. 4.19),
preparation of detailed plans for rehabilitation and construction programs,
architectural designs, preparation of bid documents (paras. 4.05, 4.07) and
the baseline survey (para. 5.11), all of which are underway. The schedule for
implementation of the financial action program is discussed in Chapter VI and
shown in Chart C-3.
D.   Procurement
5.04      Procurement under the credit would be in accordance with Bank/IDA
guidelines. Specifically:
1/   Storage specialists in the Procurement and Storage Department, the
accountants in the Finance Department, the maintenance engineer in
the Maintenance Section, etc.



- 29 -
(a) Orders for new vehicles (including mobile training teams)
and associated spare parts (US$3.47 million) 1/ and equip-
ment for open and closed flat storage, silos, mills, labor-
atories, training and offices (US$9.95 million) would be
bulked as far as practicable, and orders of US$100,000 and
above would be procured by NMC through international com-
petitive bidding (ICB) from suppliers who maintain (or agree
to maintain) in Tanzania an adequate after sales service and
inventory of spare parts;
(b) Orders for goods and vehicles below US$100,000 would be
procured in accordance with existing competitive procedures
which are satisfactory.
(c) Construction of new stores (US$10.19 million), the new mill
(US$1.14 million), the mill extension (US$0.24 million),
silo rehabilitation (US$0.9 million), and housing (US$ 0.5
million) would be grouped as far as practicable, 2/ and
construction of US$500,000 or more would be procured by
NMC through ICB;
(d) Construction of new stores, milling facilities, silo rehabili-
tation and housing at a cost of less than US$500,000, construction
of training facilities, open storage plynths, laboratories,
and office building (US$0.63 million), and rehabilitation of
closed flat storage (US$8.13 million) would be too small and
scattered to attract international interest. For rehabilitation
of closed flat storage facilities, there may be as many as 40
locations throughout the country, the largest of which is
estimated at a cost of US$250,000. Procurement would therefore
be by contracts awarded following locally advertised bidding,
although foreign firms would be entitled to compete.
Draft tender documents for all contracts expected to cost in excess of
US$100,000 would be submitted to the Association for approval befor2 invita-
tions to bid are issued, and bid analysis and recommendations for award
would be submitted to the Association for comment before contracts would be
awarded. In the evaluation of bids for (a) above, bonafide domestic manufac-
turers would be accorded a preference of 15%, or the prevailing rate of duty,
whichever is lower. In the evaluation of bids for (c) above local contractors
would be given a preference of 7 1/2%, or the prevailing rate of duty, which-
ever is lower. The Government would make land available for all civil works
to be constructed under the Project. During negotiations assurances were
obtained that the procurement procedures outlined above would be followed.
E. Disbursement
5.05      Disbursement of funds from the credit would be on the following
basis:
1/   All figures in this paragraph exclude contingencies.
2/   It is envisaged that 3 stores and the mill extension would be built
in Dar-es-Salaam.



- 30 -
(a) 80% of total expenditures for civil works, including new and
rehabilitated storage and silos, open storage cement piynths,
mill construction, laboratories, offices, housing (whether
built or purchased), and training facilities;
(b) 100% of foreign and 85% of local expenditures for vehicles;
(c) 100% of foreign and 80% of local expenditures for equipment;
(d)  100% of foreign and 85% of local expenditures for technical
assistance (ADS staff), incremental professional staff,
other consultants' services, training and studies;
(e) 100% of foreign and 85% of local expenditures for MDB;
(f) 100% of foreign and 90% of local expenditures for PPMB;
(g) amount disbursed under Project Preparation Facility;
(h) an unallocated amount representing contingencies on the above
components and transferable to them as required.
5.06      Disbursements would be fully documented except for local expendi-
tures for training which would be made against statements of expenditure
signed by the General Manager of NMC and retained at NMC for inspection by
supervision missions. A schedule showing the estimated pattern of disburse-
ment of funds is presented in Annex 1, Table T-19.
F. Accounts and Audit
5.07      Separate accounts relating to Project expenditures including state-
ments of expenditures (para. 5.06) would be kept by NMC. Assurances were
obtained at negotiations that NMC accounts would continue to be audited by
independent auditors acceptable to the Association and that such audited
accounts would be submitted to the Association within six months of the end of
the financial year. At present NMC accounts are audited by the Tanzania Audit
Corporation, and although NMC accounts are In arrears, the situation is
expected to improve as a result of the employment by NMC of a cost accountant,
5 staff accountants and a Chief Accountant (para. 4.19).
G. Management Information System
5.08      The management iniformation system (MIS) would be established in
order to make use of existing information and improve the information network
to provide management at different levels within NMC a basis on which to
assess, on an ongoing basis, critical variables that affect the costs and
profits of its operations and to identify areas for improvement. The MIS
would be established in the Finance Department with input from a management
information specialist provided under the project (para 4.20) with data
required for quarterly reports forming the basis of the information to be used
in the MIS, i.e., data on procurement, stocks, grain loss, utilization rates
of storage and milling facilities, and vehicles, as well as information on
NMC's financial position, cash flow and projections of procurement and sales.



- 31 -
H. Reporting
5.09      Detailed quarterly reports of physical progress and the use of funds
under the Project would be prepared by the Planning Manager for the General
Manager and NMC Board, and for the Association. Particular attention would
be paid in the reports to:
(a) the progress of the Project's program for construction
of storage, milling and training facilities;
(b) progress in the procurement of vehicles and equipment
related to storage, milling and training;
(c) progress in the rehabilitation of existing storage and
milling facilities;
(d) analysis of weight and quality losses of grains under
different types of storage and for different lengths
of time;
(e) description by type of storage, of utilization of
stores by quantity and type of crop and length of
storage;
(f) progress in the recruitment of Project financed staff;
(g) milling throughputs and processing coefficients;
(h) the utilization of vehicles financed under the Project,
an estimate of their costs compared to costs of vehicle
hire;
(i) summary reports on the progress relating to the Financial
Action Program (paras. 6.04-6.14);
(j) progress made by NMC toward operating within established
cost criteria (para 6.07);
(k) progress of training, identifying numbers and types
trained and under training;
(1) disbursement of IDA funds by categories;
(m) procurement by crop by region;
(n) sales of milled products by region and local and export
sales of grain, by price and quantity.
Assurances were obtained during negotiations regarding the above reporting
requirements.



- 32 -
i. Ifonitoring and Evaluation
5 10      An integral part of improving the management practices of NMC would
be monitoring and evaluation activities. During the course of the Project,
PPMB would carry out monitoring and evaluation, in cooperation with NMC's
Planning Division. In addition to its own input, PPMB would utilize the
services of MDB and staff of Ilonga Agricultural Research Center.
5.11      NMC together with PPMB would define and establish baseline data
against which subsequent data would be compared. The baseline survey would
include information: on management practices, procurement practices, quality
of grain at different stages, i.e., at the time of purchase from village, at
arrival at godown, after different lengths of time in storage and under
different conditions, milling practices, i.e., extraction rates, quality shelf
life, and transport costs. During the course of the Project, information
gathered for reporting and for MIS would be used to evaluate the Project impact
on these variables. It is expected that this evaluation would include
comment on the effectiveness of management and training and would provide an
important management tool for NMC. The monitoring and evaluation should
provide a two-way communication between PPMB and NMC on the progress of the
project. PPMB would also monitor the financial action program, (paras.
6.04-6.14), including the correction of NMC's balance sheet, annual input from
MOF, and any policy or price changes affecting NMC's finances, as well as an
evaluation of NMC's efforts to reduce its inefficiencies. The PPMB would also
be expected to assist NMC's Planning Division in the preparation of the next
phase of the Project, specifically on those aspects that concern training and
management weakness in NMC, and the continued need for a financial action
program.
5.12      At the end of each year PPMB would provide NMC, Kilimo and the Asso-
ciation with a summary report of its findings and, at the end of the disburse-
ment period, with a detailed final report. Terms of reference prepared by
PPMB for the monitoring/evaluation program, agreed by NMC and PPMB, would be
submitted to IDA for comment by August 31, 1980, and Project baseline data
would be submitted to IDA by April 30, 1981. During negotiations assurances
as to the above were obtained.
5.13      Within 6 months of completion of disbursements, NMC Planning Divi-
sion would prepare, using the findings of PPMB, a Project Completion Report,
analyzing the implementation of the Project, and its impact in relation to its
objectives. During negotiations assurances weree obtained to this effect.
VI. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A.   Financial Effects on NMC
6.01      Without significant changes in prices, in NMC's mandate to purchase
all crops with low demand, at current 1979/80 prices, and without the Project
to lower NI4C's operating costs, NMC's financial situation would soon deteriorate



- 33 -
to an untenable situation. Financial projections based on such assump-
tions 1/ (Annex 1, Tables T-9, T-11, and T-13) show that by 1985/86 NMC's
cumulative losses would reach the order of TSh 1,700 million (US$200 million)
and the cumulative bank overdraft required to finance the annual losses would
be over TSh 10 million (US$1.2 billion).
6.02      Project investment would have a financial impact on NMC by reducing
crop losses through improved practices and better facilities, and thereby
decreasing its operating costs. This is shown on a unit cost basis in Annex 1,
Tables T-4 - T-6. Using the same assumptions on prices and crop purchases
as without the Project, but taking into account these unit cost reductions,
projections of NMC's financial position are found in Annex 1, Tables T-10,
T-12, and T-14. They show that in spite of the large positive financial
impact of the Project, accumulating by 1985/86 to about TSh 1.6 billion
(US$190 million), NMC would still experience large annual losses: by 1985/86
they would reach over TSh 1 billion (US$150 million) and cumulative the bank
overdraft to finance the annual losses would reach over TSh 8 billion (US$1
billion). 2/
6.03      Even with Project investment, therefore, NMC's financial situation
would continue to deteriorate to an unacceptable level. Although Government
could in principle rectify NMC's current unsound capital structure and provide
annual subsidies to cover these losses, in practice Government is not in a
financial position to do this. The budget for all parastatal allocations is
about TSh 1 billion, while subsidies to cover NMC's annual losses alone would
be about TSh 400 million, excluding fixed costs and any interest on over-
drafts (para 3.20 and Table T-10). There will therefore have to be some
changes in policies affecting NMC, including: (a) decrease in real terms in
certain producer prices; (b) increases in real terms in consumer prices; (c)
change in NMC's mandate to procure all crops offered to it for sale; (d)
change in panterritorial pricing to take account of transport costs; and (e)
change in financial responsibility for operating the strategic grain reserve.
B.   Financial Action Program
6.04      Implementation of the Financial Action Program would have three
major objectives: (a) to correct NMC's capital structure so that its over-
draft is adjusted to reflect the value of its stock (para. 3.18); (b) to have
separate accounts established for the SGR, and to have Government pay the full
1/   Specific assumptions include:
(a)  consumer and producer prices at 1979/80 level;
(b)  NMC purchases all crops offered to it;
(c)  purchases of maize, paddy, rice and wheat grow at rates
shown in Annex 1, Table T-1;
(d)  purchases of all other crops remain at their high
1979/80 level; and
(e)  all crops not sold domestically exported at projected
world market prices, with exchange rate at its 1980 level.
Note that these analyses were done before the January 1980 change in
prices for Sembe, rice and wheat flour. See Annex 1, Table T-9,
footnote 3 for discussion.
2/   NMC's creditor and largest commercial bank, the National Bank of Commerce
has a total lending portfolio in 1979 of about TSh 4 billion.



- 34 -
cost of its operation; and (c) to eliminate NMC's annual losses over the next
several years (paras. 3.20 and 6.02).
6.05      Correction of NMC's Capital Structure.  As a priority, NMC needs
to correct its capital structure; NMC would therefore evaluate its assets and
present the new adjusted balance sheet to Treasury. Specifically:
(a) NMC would carry out a proper valuation of its inventory
of commodities, by categorizing physical quantities
of commodities by quality and valuing each category,
and would assess the value of accounts receivable.
It would determine working capital requirements.
(b) NMC would prepare a report by January 31, 1981,
explaining the consequences of (a) for NMC's financial
situation as reflected on its adjusted balance sheet;
the report would recommend the financing needed to
eliminate deficits in the equity, to repay the over-
drafts to the extent they are not adquately secured by
inventory and exceed the level appropriate to financing
part of NMC's working capital requirements, and to
provide NMC with adequate working capital.
(c) MOF would review the report submitted by NMC, prepare
and submit to the Association for review and comment
by June 30, 1981, a plan setting forth its proposed
actions in response to the recommendations in (b).
Assurances were obtained at negotiations that the steps outlined above would
be followed.
Strategic Grain Reserves
6.06      Government should assume full and direct financial responsibility
for establishing and maintaining an SGR, and should provide NMC with sufficient
funds on a quarterly basis to cover the costs of operating it. The Government
would determine the nature, size and type of crop in the SGR and, with NMC,
the costs of maintaining the SGR, and NMC would establish and maintain separate
accounts for the SGR. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that these
steps would be taken by December 31, 1980 and every year thereafter.
Elimination of NMC's Losses
6.07      Cost Criteria Study.  NMC losses are due in part to the high cost of
its own inefficiencies (para. 3.20, 6.01). One aim of this Project would be
to identify the sources of inefficiencies, recommend changes, and assist in
implementing those changes. In order to have some measure of NMC's progress
toward improving efficiency of its operations, and in order to establish
criteria against which NMC can measure its progress in this respect, a study
would be carried out to determine: (a) cost criteria for NMC's operations and
(b) costs incurred in excess of the efficient costs calculated in (a). The
study would contain specific recommendations on changes to be made in NMC's
operations within a given time which would result in lower costs and on the
records required to determine costs of operations. Agreement was reached at
negotiations that this study would be completed by January 31, 1981. It is
expected that NMC would aim at operating within these costs, allowing for
inflation, by June 1985.



- 35 -
6.08      Price Policy Review.  It is difficult to estimate the financial
impact on NMC of changes in producer or consumer prices, because not only
would NMC's margins change, but amounts bought and sold would change as well,
thereby affecting NMC's unit fixed costs. As an aplroximation, however, if
one could assume no change in quantities sold of sembe and rice, consumer
prices would have to increase, in real terms even with the Project, by about
20% for sembe and 15% for rice, for NMC to break even on sale of these crops
by 1985/86. 1/ For wheat flour sales, NMC would realize a margin of about 10%
over costs in 1985/86. For crops which NMC cannot sell domestically, and if
cassava, sorghum and millets could be exported, the export price would have to
increase or the Tanzania shilling devalue by over 90% on average in real terms
to break even by 1985/86. If NMC were not required to purchase these crops,
its annual losses would decrease by about 30-40%. 2/ Without price and/or
policy changes, NMC will not be financially viable.
6.09      In order to provide Government decision-makers with information on
the likely impact of their pricing decisions on NMC, NDB, with input from
NMC, would prepare on an annual basis the following analysis: (a) the impli-
cations of different levels of producer prices for levels of NMC purchases,
taking into account relative producer prices of alternative crops, (b) likely
levels of NIC's domestic sales given different levels of consumer prices,
(c) export prospects, (d) levels of carry-over stocks, (e) margins received by
NMC compared to its costs, (f) costs of maintaining Strategic Grain Reserves,
and (g) the implications of different producer and consumer prices for levels
of subsidies to be paid to NMC. This would be done by September 1980 for the
annual price review for 1981/82 and then on a routine basis in subsequent
years. In addition, MDB would carry out separate analysis on the financial
implications to NMC and Government of the policy of panterritorial pricing and
would include in their pricing analysis the economic border prices of crops.
Assurances were obtained at negotiations that this analysis will be done.
6.10      It must be recognized that changes in prices and/or policies that
would have a large impact on NMC's finances would also have large political
implications. Lowering producer prices or increasing consumer prices by
substantial amounts would affect incomes and producer incentives and would be
politically difficult; eliminating NMC's requirement to purchase drought-
resistant crops (cassava, etc.) would dramatically affect farmers' incomes in
semi-arid areas; and a change in panterritorial pricing, whose financial
impact on NMC should be examined, may have income distribution effects.
It should be expected, therefore, that Government would take some policy
actions to reduce NMC's losses, without entirely eliminating them.
1/   In nominal terms, assuming an annual price increase of 12.5% for 1980
and 1981, and 10% thereafter, this would mean that prices would have to
double for sembe and rice.
2/   Ceteris paribus, on the assumptions noted in para. 6.01, footnote 1.
NI4C is required by mandate to purchase these crops, and consumer prices
have recently been made sufficiently attractive to producers that they
are selling large quantities to NMC (see para 2.09).



- 36 -
6.11      Annual Subsidies.  Until Government has assumed financial respon-
sibility for the SGR (para. 6.06), and made decisions on pricing, purchase and
sales mandate (paras. 6.08 - 6.10), Government would provide NMIC with financial
assistance, in order to prevent accumulation of another unsound overdraft. In
order to assure timely subsidies, NMC's Planning Division, with input from
MDB, should prepare and submit to MOF by April 1 of each year 1/, beginning in
1981, a procurement plan which would include the quantity of each crop it
expects to purchase in the following year, and the net losses or profits
anticipated as a result of insufficient margins between producers and sales
prices. The costs used in this exercise should take into account the recom-
mendations of the cost criteria study (para. 6.07). After reviewing the
procurement plans, and making appropriate adjustments based on payments made
to NMC and profits realized by NMC in the previous year, MOF would finance
NMC's expected net losses, as estimated in the procurement plan. Assurances
were obtained at negotiations that these steps would be taken, and payments
would begin in fiscal year 1982.
6.12      To implement the Financial Action Program:
(a) The Project would provide funds to hire technical
assistance and/or short term consultants (Chief
Accountant, Cost Accountant, Grain Quality Expert,
Senior Agricultural Economist), that would, as a
team and in conjunction with the Planning Division
in NMC and MDB, be responsible for drawing up the
recommendations to correct NMC's capital structure.
This team would also be responsible for carrying
out the cost criteria study.
(b) NMC's Planning Division would be responsible for
drawing up the Procurement Plan, to present to
MOF not later than April 1, so that the required
subsidies would be included in the following year's
budget.
An implementation schedule for the Financial Action Program is found in
Annex 1, Chart C-3.
6.13      With the funds provided under the PPF, recruitment has begun of
consultants to draw up the recommendations and carry out the cost criteria
study, and the terms of reference for consultants have been agreed between
Government and IDA.
6.14      Agreement was reached at negotiations that Government and NMC would
take the necessary steps in the combination of policy decisions, correction of
NMC's capital structure, and annual subsidies so that by June 30, 1982 and
1/   In time to be included in Government's annual budget.



- 37 -
every June 30 thereafter, 1/ NMC's overdraft, or other short-term financial
instrument, does not exceed 25% of the value of expected annual crop sales for
the following year. 2/ Future investment in later phases depends on acceptable
progress on pricing and policy changes and the Financial Action Program.
C. Government Cash Flow Implications
6.15      It is difficult to assess the full impact of the Project on Govern-
ment cash flow, as it depends on changes in policies and prices versus sub-
sidies to NMC.  The impact of Project Investment alone, excluding Government
input into the financial action program, is shown in Table T-15, and shows
that the Project would have a negative effect on Government cash flow in all
but 2 years in the life of the Project largely due to the fact that all IDA
funds would be passed on to NMC as equity to improve NMC's financial situa-
tion. The joint Government and NMC cash flow situation would be considerably
better than without the project, even without taking into account the impact
of the expected policy changes.
D. Foreign Exchange Implications
6.16      The Project would have a favorable impact on foreign exchange earn-
ings/savings (Table T-16). Assumptions regarding the savings in foreign
exchange from the reduction in imports of maize, rice and wheat that would
result from reduced losses in storage are described in para. 7.03. There is
an additional possible increase in foreign exchange earnings from reductions
in losses on crops which are now exported (cassava, sorghum, millets) but
this has been excluded in estimating the foreign exchange impact, in the
event that there is a change in policy on purchase of these crops from farm-
ers. Over the period 1979/80-1989/90, except for the first year of the Proj-
ect, when disbursements from the IDA Credit would lag behind Project expendi-
ture, there would be a net inflow of foreign exchange. The cumulative impact
on net foreign exchange savings over this period would be US$62.3 million
(Tsh 516.7 million).
VII. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
Project Benefits
7.01      As the first phase of a long-term program of development for
the official foodcrop marketing and processing sector, the Project has two
principal objectives: (i) to improve NMC's financial situation by direct
Government contributions and by strengtihening the mechanism of price policy
formulation; (ii) to improve NMC's managerial capacity to procure, transport,
store and mill food crops and thereby reduce crop losses. it is expected that
this Project will improve decision-making on policies affecting NMC and
1/   This is the beginning of NMC's procurement season, wher the overdraft
should be at its lowest.
2/   This is a reasonable estimate of a financially souind size.



- 38 -
Government, by analysis of their economic and financial consequences. It will
also enable NMC to plan and effectively implement future expansion of physical
facilities, by strengthening management and improving technical capability of
NMC staff.
Nature of Quantifiable Benefits
7.02      The following benefits would be realized as a result of the Project:
(a)  Because of a reduction in storage losses, a larger
quantity of grain would be available for milling
to satisfy domestic demand as a result of improved
storage facilities and improved management of grain
handling. This would result in foreign exchange
savings from a reduction in the need to import
grain, or in an increase in foreign exchange earn-
ings from increased exports, in the case that
Tanzania had surplus maize to export.
(b)  In the event that NMC continues to purchase other
crops, such as red sorghum and millets, the reduc-
tion in storage losses would result in a larger
quantity of these crops available for export.
On the assumption that there will be some change
in policy regarding these crops, this benefit is
not quantified below.
(c)  Supply of milled maize (sembe) available for domestic
consumption would increase from the expansion in
milling capacity and rehabilitation of existing
facilities.
These economic benefits would result in the financial benefit of a reduction
in the margins required between producer and consumer prices to cover NMC's
costs. Although the financial effect of this benefit would take some time
to materialize, the Project would have made a beginning in the right direction.
Magnitude of Benefits
7.03      Assumptions on Storage.  The first benefit, the reduction in storage
losses, [para. 7.02(a)] is the most readily quantifiable. Because of the lack
of baseline data and the broad range of estimates of storage losses (paras.
3.09), assumptions are made on current losses in weight and quality, as well
as on benefits that would accrue from the Project. The estimates in Table 9
do not take into account reduction in losses from policy changes that would
reduce quantities of crops handled by NMC, and thus reduce the management
problems, or from construction of village godowns, as both of these are
external to the Project investment. These benefits from reductions in crop
losses would be realized gradually, starting in year 3 of the Project and
increasing up to year 5 (1984/85), to an estimated total savings in crop
losses of 20 percentage points from rehabilitation of closed storage facilities,
of 30 percentage points from construction of new stores (the without project
situation of uncontrolled open losses, with tarpaulins already owned by NMC,
would be 40%), and of 45 percentage points from improved management, handling,
and provision of new tarpaulins for open storage. It is assumed that capacity
utilization of stores is 70%.

even from tarpaulins.  This is not the current situation, but if the
Project did tnot make provision for tarpaulin replacement and NMC were
unable to find alternative finance, it would be the "without Project
situation."
3/   Applies both to new ar.d rehabilitated stores.
4/   Losses are both quantitative and qualitative, for crops held 9-12
months with no turnover.
7.04      The overall impact of the Project is presented in Annex 1, Table
T-17 in terms of the savings in crop losses, by type of investment. The
quantities saved would represent about 6%, 12% and 15% of total estimated
domestic production of maize, rice and wheat, respectively, by 1985/86, and
decline somewhat in percentage terms thereafter.
7.05      The potential benefit in foreign exchange earnings from the export
of other crops (cassava, sorghum, millets) would depend on Government policy
toward continued NMC purchase of these crops. It is expected that the finan-
cial action program (paras. 6.04-6.14) will point toward the reduction or
elimination of these purchases, by making their costs explicit. No attempt
has been made here to estimate the economic gain, from either the reduction
In loss from proper storage of these crops, or from changes in policies.
7.06      Assumptions on Milling.  Benefits from new and rehabilitated mills
are difficult to quantify, and depend on the valuation of milling the maize.
The actual costs of NMC milling are not a reliable indication of the economic
value added, as NMC does not operate on a competitive basis. In the private
sector in urban areas milling charges vary from 15 to 35 cents per kilo at
contract mills, depending on the location (the charges are higher in Dar Es
Salaam) and on whether the mill keeps the by-product (bran). A calculation of
tnie economic value of hand milling maize using a shadow wage of urban labor
(para. 7.08) for women results in a value of 25 to 45 cents per kilo. 1/ The
1/   The parameters are not known with any precision, but it is estimated
that hand-pounding one kilo of maize takes one-half to one hour, and
the value of an hour of the lowest category of urban income earners is
estimated roughly at about T.Sh .46/hr.



- 40 -
value of 25 cents per kilo of maize has thus been used as a conservative
estimate in the economic analysis, so that the additional milling capacity to
be provided under the Project would result in an additional 57,000 mt of maize
milled, or Tsh 11.4 million of value added annually, from 1983/84 onwards.
Beneficiaries
7.07      Better marketing on the part of NMC would affect all producers of
surplus crops who sell to NMC, as there would be an improvement in pro-
curement from villages and more timely payments. Some villages are now well-
serviced by NMC while others suffer from delayed procurement and payments.
The potential number of beneficiaries of an improved market system is quite
large, however, because at least 30% of Tanzanian farmers, or about 700,000
farming families, are involved in production and sales to NMC of surplus crop.
In addition, reductions in NMC's operating costs from increased efficiency and
reduced qualitative and quantitative crop losses could benefit both producers
and consumers by reducing the margins between producer and consumer prices
necessary to cover NMC's costs. The distribution of benefits between the two
depends on the pricing policies pursued by Government, where the producer
prices could be raised to benefit farmers, or consumer prices lowered to
benefit consumers.
Economic Costs and Benefits
7.08      The incremental economic costs and benefits of the Project are
found in Table T-17. They are expressed in constant January 1980 terms.
Costs are net of identifiable taxes, and include physical contingencies on
capital goods. For individual Project components, relevant costs of training
and technical assistance have been allocated. Benefits are based on the
reduction in losses of crops sold domestically (maize, rice and wheat) from
improved facilities and better management (para 7.03) and from the incremental
economic value added of the milled maize (para 7.06). The shadow-price of
foreign exchange in both the costs and benefits has been taken at TSh 12 =
US$1.0, to reflect the economic value of foreign exchange to Tanzania, which
differs from the official financial exchange rate because of quantitative
import restrictions and duties on imports. An average shadow wage of one-half
of the wage bill for unskilled and semi-skilled labor in construction and in
incremental recurrent costs has been used, to reflect the existence of limited
urban employment opportunities in Tanzania. The economic life of capital
structures (warehouses, silos, and mills) is taken at 20 years, and costs
include maintenance of these structures. Since losses of grain would probably
result in higher import requirements, the incremental benefits are valued at
import parity prices based on projections of CIF Dar Es Salaam and adjusted
for costs of handling and transport into store. The average weighted economic
import parity price per ton of crop saved was estimated to increase from TSh
3,680 in 1981/82 to TSh 3,920 in 1985/86; weights were based on expected
proportions of maize, wheat, rice and paddy stored in each year (from Annex 1,
Table T-1). The quantities saved were estimated by the percentage reduction
in savings times the quantity stored per warehouse (or under tarpaulins) times
the number of new or rehabilitated warehouses; for the whole project, the
quantity of crops involved was the total maize, paddy, rice and wheat handled
by NMC. Sensitivity analysis is done for the case where Tanzania would be an
exporter of maize and the export parity price of maize used instead of the
import parity price.

Results of the Economic Analysis
7.09      The results of the economic analysis for individual components and
for the total Project are presented below:

1/   Includes 40% of stores and all the silos.
2/.  Includes rehabilitation of mills.
7.10      The rate of return on the individual component reflects the "with
Project" benefits of investment, technical assistance and training. In the
rate of return for the entire Project, the unallocated costs of technical
assistance and training are included. Benefits of these two components accrue
to the total quantity of maize, paddy, rice and wheat stored by NMC both in
rehabilitated and new "Project" stores and in other "non-Project" stored.
Thus the overall rate of return reflects these widespread benefits and is much
greater than for a single component which includes the prorated technical
assistance and training as well as the investment In facilities. The rate of
return on the milling component should be regarded as the lower limit, as the
economic value of the milling has been estimated conservatively (para. 7.06).
7.11      Decreases in benefits could come from a lower-than-expected decrease
in crop losses (from too-high losses without Project, or too-low losses with
Project), export possibilities for maize (use of export- instead of import-
parity price for maize), or slower realization of benefits. Costs may increase
in real terms. The results of sensitivity analysis on the rate of return show:
Changes in Assumptions                  ERR
Benefits down by 20% 1/                 31%
Benefits lagged one year                29%

Cost up by 20% and
benefits down by 20%                  26%
1/  This includes the situation where an export
parity price is used for maize instead of an
import parity price.

7.12      One risk of the Project is that policies affecting NMC would not be
changed sufficiently to reduce NMC's financial losses significantly, because
the policies have important economic and political implications for distribu-
tion of income and producer incentives. This in turn implies that large
subsidies would be required, which the Government of Tanzania would have
difficulty in financing. Agreement in principle would be sought at negotia-
tions that the financial action program would be implemented, and subsequent
phases of IDA-financed projects for NMC would be contingent on progress in the
financial action program. A second risk of the Project is that management and
technical practices might not improve significantly, which would be a function
of the scope and complexity of NMC's operat-ons and associated problems.
Although technical assistance and training have been provided, this Project
should be seen as the first phase of a long term program to deal with these
problems. Finally, there is the risk that implementation of the construction
program, and especially of the rehabilitation component, would lag behind
schedule. This would be the result both oL management difficulties within NMC
and of the scattered and piecemeal nature of the rehabilitation. This risk
has been reduced by provision of technical assistance and by funds under the
PPF which will permit early recruitment and an early start to the design work
for the rehabilitation and construction.

master plan, satisfactory to IDA, showing financial, economic and technical
viability of each additional store (para 4.07).
8.03      It would be a condition of disbursement against the transport com-
ponent of the Project that an experienced and qualified transport manager be

1/  Demand for grains
(a) Growth in demand assumed at the same rate as projected population growth (implicitly holding real income constant).
(1) Sembe sales were assumed to be two-thirds in urban areas and one-third in rural areas and were thus projected
to grow at the weighted average of 5.43% p.a.
(2) Rice and wheat were assumed to be sold   mainly in urban areas and thus were projected to increase at a rate of
6.84% p.a.
(b) Base year:
(1) Sembe sales have fluctuated widely from year-to-year, so the figure for the base year 1977/78 was taken as an
average of three years 1976/77 - 1978/79 at 113,000 mt.
(2) Rice and Wheat sales are thought to be constrained by ability to import and thus consumption in 1977/78 is taken
as a base year.
2/ Grain equivalents are based on the extraction rates. For sembe the current extraction rate is 89%, which under better
management should be brought down to 85% (for better quality and longer shelf life). Extraction rates for rice and
wheat flour are 65%, and 75%, respectively.
3/ Grain purchases required to meet demand. Purchases required are estimated such that, after the estimated losses in
quantity and quality, there would be sufficient grain to meet commercial demand. These losses are weighted averages of
those assumed in open and closed storage, without and with the project, as shown in Table 10.
4/ Domestic purclases.
Maize purchases are assumed to remain at a level of 200,000 Mt/year.
Rice purchases - It is assumed that official purciases of both rice and paddy increape at a rate of about 10% per annum
from 1977/78 onwards,vhich is a conservative estimate of increased production expected from a number of
development projects due to get undjway in the next few years.
Wheat purchases - It is assumed that official purchases of wheat increase from a base level of 35,000 Mt in 1977/78 at
about 5,000 tons/year. This is a conservative estimate of increased production from NAFCO state farms as a result
of projects now underway financed by CTDA. This would imply purchases in l19q7T80 of 45,000 Mt, but
because of lower-than-expected estimated purchases in 1978/79, the series has been lowered to start
at 40,000 Mt in 1979/80.

1/  Reflects payments from Treasury to NMC for distributing imported foodgrsins at a loss.
2/ The sharp decrease in interest on Bank Overdraft was largely due to NMC transferring TSh 27.3 million
in interest to the Treasury account.
3/ In the absence of authentic physical stock figures on imported foodstuffs, no provisions could be made on the losses
that would be incurred (and therefore, recoverable from Treasury) on the sale of these commodities in FY 1975. Thus
cost of sales for FY 1975 has been overstated to some extent.  It was not possible to make an independent assessment
of the loss for each year.  The results for FY 1975 and FY 1976 should be interpreted as a commulative loss of Tsh.
14.17 million for these two years.
4/ Figure includes a 41% shrinkage loss.
5/ The accounts from 1978 were not fully reconciled. The losses could be higher.

1/ See footnote on Table T-11.
2/ At 9% of previous years ending balance.
3/ Note that these projections, and those in Tables T-1O through T-14 are based on the prices
for sembe, wheat flour and rice, prevailing in December 1979. In January 1980, the price
of sembe was decreased by over 30% (from T.Sh. 1.85 to T.Sh. 1.25/kg), and increased for
wheat flour and rice by over 50% (wheat flour: T.Sh. 3.75 to T.Sh. 5.85/kg; rice: T.Sh. 3.50
to T.Sh. 5.35/kg). Using the same assumptions on consumption levels, NMC's revenues by
1985/86 would be about T.Sh. 300 m higher than shown in these tables and thus, for with-Project
situation, Table T-10, NMC would almost break even. However, with such large changes in
relative prices, consumption in wheat flour and rice would decrease while that of sembe
would probably increase. The net positive impact oh NMC's revenues would therefore be less
than if consumption patterns were unchanged, but it is not possible to estimate what the
impact would be,because consumer response to such changes is unknown.
